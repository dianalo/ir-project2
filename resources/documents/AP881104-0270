Michael Dukakis, his rival for the presidency, says a strongdomestic energy industry ``is vital to the security of our nation,''and he promises to target assistance to small and medium producers.He has fought efforts to license the controversial Seabrook nuclearplant in New Hampshire, just over the Massachusetts border.   Both presidential candidates oppose oil import fees or tariffs.Both also oppose increasing the federal tax on gasoline.   Both see a larger role in America's future for natural gas andcoal, and both favor pressing ahead with research on ways to burncoal cleanly. The two laud alternative fuels such as methanol fromnatural gas, and ethanol from grain.   While energy issues have not received the same attention in thepresidential race as has the environment, each candidate has laidout detailed positions on energy issues:   Here is an overview:</TEXT><HEAD>BUSH</HEAD><TEXT>   The Republican says oil and gas will remain America's main sourceof energy for a long time. He says the nation must ``find more andconserve more,'' applying ``our best technology and ingenuity''while protecting the environment.   Bush says almost 100,000 oil wells ``have been abandoned becausethey are not economic at low prices and high taxes.'' He says hewill try to reverse the fortunes of the domestic oil industry with:   _Tax incentives for stripper wells.   _A 10 percent tax credit for oil and gas exploration up to $10million of costs and 5 percent above that.   _Expanding the research and development tax credit to includeenhanced recovery techniques.   _Eliminating 80 percent of intangible drilling costs as subjectto the alternative minimum tax for independent producers.   Bush says he will keep filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,with a goal of 740 million barrels by 1993.   Although Bush has called for a moratorium on drilling inenvironmentally sensitive tracts such as parts of northernCalifornia, he generally favors oil drilling on the outercontinental shelf.   ``There is no way to meet our energy requirements withoutoffshore drilling,'' Bush says. But, he adds, ``A few tracts ... areso sensitive environmentally, aesthetically or commercially thatthey should not be leased.''   He wants Congress to decontrol natural gas prices. ``We shouldfully decontrol natural gas and seek more competitive transportationof gas,'' Bush says. ``Gas decontrol alone will save the averageconsumer household $25 to $40 a year.''   On nuclear energy, Bush says, ``As long as the highest safetystandards are maintained, nuclear power must be a part of our energymix.''   He supported the law this year that gave states the right toraise their speed limits to 65 miles per hour, which increases fuelconsumption.   Bush headed a Reagan Regulatory Task Force that was instrumentalin repealing federal requirements for energy efficiency in newbuildings.   Bush also favors repealing fuel economy standards for automobiles.   Bush advisers say the tax incentives favored by Bush couldincrease production by 600,000 barrels a day and cost $600 millionin annual tax revenue.   Domestic oil production is currently about 8.2 million barrels aday, or 9 percent below 1985 levels. The industry has lost 300,000jobs since then.</TEXT><HEAD>DUKAKIS</HEAD><TEXT>   The Massachusetts governor says, ``We have no national energypolicy today _ only a morass of conflicting ideologies and regionalinterests.''   He has promised to take steps to:   _Insure ``against the economic catastrophe of a disruption inforeign oil supplies.''   _Encourage a strong, health energy industry.   _Promote conservation and fuel efficiency.   _Make sure that energy policies do not conflict withenvironmental goals, including reduced acid rain and urban ozonelevels.   Dukakis says he would keep filling the Strategic PetroleumReserve and seek closer ties with such oil-supplying nations asCanada, Mexico and Venezuela as insurance against disruption ofMiddle East supplies.   To stimulate oil and gas drilling, Dukakis promises ``acounter-cyclical program to assist ... energy-producing regions whentimes are tough.''   He said he will ``target assistance on small and medium producerswho do most of the exploratory drilling,'' and phase out the programwhen oil prices and rig counts move back up.   He would tie the federal aid ``to comparable assistance or taxrelief by the state,'' and suggested one possibility would be ``atemporary abatement of federal taxes'' on income produced from newwells.   Another possibility, he said, is to restrict a portion of the oilpurchased for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to oil from newfields, and to pay a $5 per barrel premium for it.   Dukakis says he would expand the $10 million federal researchbudget for enhanced oil recovery techniques.   On natural gas, Dukakis says he would seek ``to remove thebarriers that prevent distribution companies, utilities and largeindustrial customers from bargaining directly with producers.''   Dukakis would use price incentives and regulations ``to spur theuse of ethanol and methanol,'' and maintain rules requiring autoproducers to build more fuel-efficient cars.   Dukakis says he will appoint Nuclear Regulatory Commissioners``dedicated to strong enforcement of safety standards.'' He says thefederal liability limit that protects the nuclear industry in theevent of accidents is ``outdated and unnecessary.''   He opposes building new nuclear plants until safer reactors aredesigned and safe ways are found to treat and dispose of waste.   Bush favors exploration of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge inAlaska, a good drilling prospect. Dukakis opposes it.</TEXT></DOC>
