The superpowers have agreed to a ceiling of 195,000 troops eachfor the United States and Soviet Union in central Europe.   The agreement, reached at meetings among NATO and Wasaw Pactforeign ministers in Ottawa, Canada, is to be part of a finalaccord on reducing troops, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclararms in Europe. Negotiators hope to reach agreement on the accordbefore the end of this year.   The new proposal, combined with East bloc nations' plans to cuttheir own armed forces, would lead to NATO having more manpower inthe region than the Warsaw Pact, said East Germany's chief delegateat arms talks, Klaus-Dieter Ernst.   Ernst said the seven Warsaw Pact countries would have a totaltroop strength in central Europe of 600,000 to 700,000 troops,while the West would have a total of some 1 million troops.   ``That situation is totally unsatisfactory,'' Ernst said.   Western sources appeared to contest Ernst's estimate, sayingNATO currently has about 900,000 troops in central Europe, whichcovers West Germany, East Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium,Luxembourg, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and Denmark.   In the wake of democratic reforms in Eastern Europe and theirgrowing independence from Moscow, Hungary and Czechoslovakia havebegun negotiations with the Kremlin on a total withdrawal of Soviettroops from their territories. Those talks are separate from theongoing Vienna talks.   The Soviet idea was presented at the last Vienna plenary beforea three-week recess, but it was not put on the table as a formalproposal.   Ernst said that the overall ceiling suggested by the Sovietswould include domestic troops as well as those stationed on foreignsoil.   In separate negotiations, the Hungarians are seeking withdrawalof the approximately 50,000 Soviet troops stationed on theirterritory, while Czechoslovakia seeks the total removal of 73,500Soviet troops from its soil.   Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have also announced troopcuts of their own.   Both East and West also presented new proposals in an effort tonarrow differences on definitions of certain armaments and treatylanguage for verification of any troop withdrawals.   West Germany's chief delegate, Ruediger Hartmann, presented twoworking papers on behalf of NATO on information exchanges andconditions for inspections as part of a verification program.   Ernst said he presented on behalf of the Warsaw Pact a paper ontank definitions.   Definitions of weapons categories have been a major stickingpoint at the negotiations, which began last March. The sides alsodisagree on the number of combat aircrat each side should have.   ``Lots of work remains to be done here,'' U.S. chief delegate,R. James Woolsey told reporters.</TEXT></DOC>
