That's notentertainment, but it's attracting enough viewers and advertisers tokeep things sunny at the 7-year-old cable television station.   The concept of round-the-clock weather may sound unlikely to haveviewers glued to their sets. But The Weather Channel has grown to bethe nation's 14th-largest cable network in terms of subscribers.   The channel, owned by Virginia-based Landmark CommunicationsInc., is affiliated with 3,650 cable systems across the nation andreaches 38.5 million households.   By comparison, the nation's top cable channel, ESPN, is availableto 50 million subscribers, according to the National CableTelevision Association, an industry organization.   ``People laughed at Landmark when we launched The Weather Channel_ no way,'' said Michael J. Eckert, the president of the station.``Industry observers really didn't give us more than a year, and weproved them wrong.   ``But we always knew, we were the ones who did the homework andthe research,'' he said. ``We weren't entertainment, we weren'tflashy, we weren't glamorous. You know, it's kind of everyday,bread-and-butter information.''   Eckert, interviewed in his office below the channel's suburbanAtlanta studios as a steady rain fell outside, said he sees theattraction of full-time weather in fairly simple terms. Likeautomated bank tellers, fast food and speedy oil changes, it's areflection of today's society in which quick information is at apremium, he said.   ``America is becoming more and more an on-demand, I-want-it-now,instant-gratification society,'' Eckert said. ``People are also in aposition of requiring on-demand information.''   Frequent travelers, outdoor workers, farmers, rescue agencies andthose in the aviation industry are among the station's regularviewers, Eckert said. Families also want current weather informationto help dress the kids for school or plan weekend outings.   Eckert said the station's planners knew from the start viewerswouldn't watch weather programming like other TV fare.   ``We knew we couldn't expect people to watch us as they watch ahalf-hour TV program,'' Eckert said. ``Anybody that would watch usfor a half-hour is probably one of those weather nuts who is reallyinto weather as a dynamic.''   ``They went out and filled a very valuable niche,'' said JohnWolfe, spokesman for the Washington-based cable association. ``Ifyou live on the Gulf Coast in the hurricane season, you develop areal appreciation for them.''   There is much competition for reporting the weather, Eckert said.But local radio and television reports provide weather informationonly a few minutes each day, and newspaper weather pages are printedhours before the reader sees them, he added.   ``While there is competition, it's not there all the time,'' hesaid. ``In some cases, we supplement or complement what's there. Inothers, we replace it.''   Recently, the station has incorporated a series of documentaries_ on such subjects as drought, coastal erosion and earthquakes _ butthe heart of the operation remains the continual weather reports andforecasts.   ``We live weather,'' Eckert said. ``That's our business.''   The channel employs 50 meteorologists and is now offering tocable systems a computer system called The Weather Star 4000 thattaps into the nation's more than 700 local weather zones tocoordinate the local forecasts that are incorporated into thenational programming about every five minutes, Eckert said.   Because the typical Weather Channel viewer stays tuned in foronly about 10 minutes at a time, according to Eckert, the stationsells its advertising space more like radio than the average TVstation.   Rather than selling, for example, one spot in a popular program,The Weather Channel sells advertising spots to run many times a dayto catch the viewers during their brief periods of watching thestation, Eckert said. Instead of long breaks for clusters ofcommercials, the weather station has frequent one-minute commercialbreaks.   ``We generate audience like radio, lots of turnover, soadvertisers buy us that way,'' Eckert said.   He said the channel currently has about 200 national advertisers.   Though the main work of the station is to provide fast, accurateweather information, Eckert said the channel is trying to make itspresentation more visually attractive.   The reports are generally given from a set resembling a newsprogram, with maps the primary visual aid. But the station is makingincreased use of graphics, taped reports and live shots, such asfootage from the scene of severe weather. During Hurricane Gilbertin 1988, the channel had two crews in Jamaica to deliver livereports, Eckert said.   Eckert said many of The Weather Channel's viewers probably tunedin the first time during a period of severe weather. He said hehopes that once someone sees what that channel has to offer, theywill come back for more.   ``We spend millions of dollars a year on viewer research,''Eckert said. ``We are in a continual state of evolution. We're veryconsumer-driven.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday July 9</NOTE></DOC>
