(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A spokesman for the nation's tobaccofarmers blasted the U.S. surgeon general on Monday and said hisreport comparing nicotine to addictive drugs like heroin andcocaine was nonsense.   ``I think it is just another salvo in the political war againsttobacco and doesn't have a thing to do with science,'' said ReggieLester, managing director of the Tobacco Growers' InformationCommittee Inc. ``It's politics as usual from the anti-tobaccocrowd.''   Lester called Surgeon General C. Everett Koop ``a politicalanimal,'' called his report ``patent nonsense'' and said, ``He'scrossed the line of common sense.''   Lester's organization is a coalition of 44 growers' groups basedin North Carolina, which produces about two-thirds of the nation'stobacco.   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in Winston-Salem, North Carolina'slargest maker of cigarettes, would not comment on the report andreferred all calls to The Tobacco Institute in Washington.   State Agriculture Commissioner Jim Graham was out of town andunavailable for comment.   Koop's report organized previously disclosed research into apresentation lumping nicotine with heroin and cocaine asphysiologically addictive substances.   ``Careful examination of the data makes it clear that cigarettesand other forms of tobacco are addicting,'' Koop wrote in apreface. ``An extensive body of research has shown that nicotine isthe drug in tobacco that causes addiction.   Sen. Terry Sandord, D-N.C., said that Koop's comparison oftobacco _ a legitimate and legal substance _ to insidious narcotics... is a direction of ``friendly fire'' at American farmers andbusinessmen.   ``Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.'' Sanford said. ``This isthe administration that declares war on drugs, and then counselspeople to `just say no.'''   ``I concur with recent statements that we have never heard of asmoker robbing a convenience store, a gas station or a little oldlady to obtain money to purchase cigarettes,'' said W.B. Jenkins,North Carolina Farm Bureau president. ``There have been numerousnews reports of such robberies to obtain monies to satisfyaddiction to marijuana, heroin or cocaine.''   Lester said the tobacco industry won't suffer from beingmentioned with drugs such as heroin and cocaine because, ``I'm notsure that you can create a more difficult social stigma for tobaccothan already exits.''   Lester also said it was ``erroneous'' for Koop to conclude thatchildren are buying cigarettes from vending machines.   ``Almost all of the vending machines that are out there aresupervised by adults,'' Lester said. ``They go for upscalerestaurants and bars ... . They take surveys and find out that thenumber of young people that buy cigarettes from vending machines isless than 5 percent.   ``We do not want young people as customers,'' Lester added. ``Wethink smoking is an adult custom. If they (the government) want totake some measures ... for making it harder young people to buycigarettes, we wouldn't have any problems with that.''</TEXT></DOC>
