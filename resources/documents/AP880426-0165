Bennett presented a progress report on theschools. ``I'm confident this report will help us find the way.''   Reagan held a White House ceremony to mark the fifth anniversaryof the National Commission on Excellence in Education's bitingcritique, ``A Nation At Risk,'' that spawned efforts in nearlyevery state to raise academic standards and the pay and performanceof teachers.   Reagan said the earlier report, commissioned by Bennett'spredecessor, T.H. Bell, ``helped heighten and acclerate a wave ofeducation reform in states and communities all around the country.''   He said it led many states to install career ladders and meritpay for teachers, and many schools placed ``a new emphasis onquality and discipline, more homework, more attention to basicskills.''   ``This was truly revolutionary after two decades in which moneyhad been the only measure of progress in education and in whichwhile federal spending on education went steadily up, test scoresfell steadily downward. Too many schools accepted the fashions ofthe day, fashions of liberal culture that held traditionalstandards in scorn,'' Reagan said.   Earlier, 350 National Education Association members rallied inLafayette Park across from the White House to protest the report.Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., drew applause when he calledBennett ``the secretary of ignorance.'   NEA President Mary Hatwood Futrell said Bennett's report was anattempt to ``whitewash'' the administration's failure to fulfillits obligation to help improve schools.   ``American educatioan can be made to work better and it can bemade to work better now,'' Reagan told the 200 people gathered inthe East Room of the White House.   Bell was not invited to the ceremony. Eight of the 18 members ofthe National Commission on Excellence in Education did attend,including University of California President David Gardner, whosaid afterwards of the Bennett report, ``It was timely, helpful,tended to be constructive. I believe it could have been written ina more positive fashion. ... I also think it was short in terms ofthe role the federal government ought to be playing.''   Bennett said in presenting the report to the president,``American education has made some progress in the last few years.... But we are not doing well enough, and we are not doing wellenough fast enough. We are still at risk.''   ``If our schools are to improve, the powerful resistance toreform must be overcome. ... The nation's modest success over thepast five yers is both proof of reform's possibilities and asummons to renewed effort,'' Bennett said.   ``I guarantee you we will seize the opportunity to elect apro-education president of the United States,'' said Ms. Futrell inaddressing the protesters. ``Only then will we have a secretary ofeducation more interested in leadership than in showmanship.''   The NEA was one of the few major education groups not invited tothe ceremony.   ``A Nation At Risk'' made headlines and laid the groundwork formoves in   ``I think it's an excellent report, a good summary of whatprogress has been made and also of what remains to be done,'' Bellsaid in a telephone interview from Salt Lake City.   But Bell said he wished the report had given greater emphasis to``what the federal government should be doing,'' especially on the``horrendous problem'' of 40 percent dropout rates for minorityyouths.   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation ofTeachers, said, ``If Secretary Bennett and the president reallyfeel that the nation is still at risk, they ought to proposesomething that the federal government does to get us out of thismess other than just preaching at everyone else.''   Bennett's report said: ``American education has made someundeniable progress in the last few years. The precipitous downwardslide of previous decades has been arrested, and we have begun thelong climb back to reasonable standards.   ``We are doing better than we were in 1983. But we are certainlynot doing well enough. ... We are still at risk.''   Scott D. Thomson, executive director of the National Associationof Secondary School Principals, said:   ``He doesn't recognize that we've made these gains at the sametime we've admitted over 2 million non-English speaking immigrantstudents to the school population ... (and) in the face of growingnumbers of poor families.   ``He doesn't recognize the fact that we're fending off the drugpushers with one hand from the community and trying to teach themwith the other.''</TEXT></DOC>
