(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of Wickes Companies Inc.managers on Friday withdrew their $598 million buyout offer for thehome and industrial products company, citing deteriorating earnings.   The group, led by Wickes Chairman Sanford Sigoloff, announcedthe decision along with a report that warned the company might losemoney on continuing operations in the third and fourth quarters andthe fiscal year.   Operating income for the year could be $40 million less thanwhat was forecast at the time the buyout offer was made on Aug. 21,the company said. Operating income for August and September was $15million below projections, the company said.   Future earnings are critical to a leveraged buyout transactionbecause the acquiror must rely on cash flow to help repay loansused to finance the purchase.   The management group offered to pay $12 for each Wickes share ina leveraged buyout.
