The method for three-dimensional bone and soft tissue reconstructions,in our institution, are implemented as a series of computer programsthat run on the HITACHI whole body CT scanner CT-W 600. The images forthree-dimensional reconstruction produced by ''Mixture Shading'' and''Retouch'' method which we developed. Preoperative anatomic definitionand surgical planning can be made using three-dimensional image. Ourwork in three-dimensional surface CT reconstruction initially assistedthe understanding of aberrant anatomy. This console is a three-dimensionaldisplay terminal that allows the real time rotation of a three-dimensionalsolid image in any of the x, y, and z axes. The surgeon is assisted bythe availability of linear measurement and the ability to move imagecomponents.</TEXT></DOC>
