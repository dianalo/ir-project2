The State of the Union address Tuesday will present thepresident's plan for economic revival to a nation that isholding him responsible for hard times and demanding action.At the same time, the prime-time address is the openingvolley of Mr. Bush's campaign for a second term.</LP><TEXT>   The result is that the pressure on him to deliver isenormous, all the more because his struggle is being foughton what for him is the unfamiliar terrain of domestic policy.&quot;This is the first time where having the president accomplishsomething domestically is important to the White House,&quot;observes Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at theBrookings Institution.   In response, the president and his aides have builtexpectations for the address to the point where they may beimpossible to fulfill. In New Hampshire last week, thepresident was privately telling supporters that it would be&quot;the best speech&quot; he has given. &quot;The State of the Unionaddress has become the defining event of the Bushpresidency,&quot; declares a memo distributed by the Bush-Quaylecampaign at a meeting with constituency groups this week.   Even those sympathetic to the president fear the heavyemphasis on the State of the Union could be a mistake.&quot;Expectations are going to be very hard to satisfy,&quot; saysThomas &quot;Lud&quot; Ashley, a longtime friend of Mr. Bush and aformer Democratic congressman who now heads the Associationof Bank Holding Companies. &quot;It's quite clear that theAmerican people want instant gratification when it comes to arecession. They want something done right now.&quot;   This volatile situation has come about largely as a resultof the president's decision to delay action on the economyjust as public dissatisfaction intensified late last year. Anew Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll suggests just what thatdecision to delay has cost Mr. Bush in political terms.   The president's job approval rating, which stood at 70% asrecently as five months ago, is down to 53%, while 40%disapprove of the job he is doing. And 70% of the 1,502registered voters surveyed disapprove of Mr. Bush's handlingof the economy.   Moreover, the survey by Democratic pollster Peter Hart andRepublican pollster Vince Breglio underscores the heavybaggage Mr. Bush carries into the fray with congressionalDemocrats who are increasingly emboldened by signs of WhiteHouse weakness. When given a list of specific complaints thathave been leveled against the president, three-fourths of allvoters agree, and two-thirds of those &quot;strongly&quot; agree, thatMr. Bush pays too little attention to domestic problems. Andby a margin of nearly 3 to 1, they agree that the president'spolicies favor the rich over the middle class; again, twiceas many people say they &quot;strongly&quot; agree with that statementas say they &quot;just somewhat&quot; agree with it.   A 55% majority agrees with the statement that Mr. Bush &quot;isnot talking about issues that matter to people like you.&quot; Andabout two-thirds of voters strongly or somewhat agree thatMr. Bush &quot;has no plan to improve health care significantly&quot;and &quot;reacts to problems instead of anticipating them.&quot;   As he prepares for the speech, Mr. Bush will have toreconcile the divergent strains in his own split politicalpersonality. As president, his personal and ideologicalinstincts run toward conciliation with congressionalDemocrats. Yet as a candidate, Mr. Bush is inclined toaffect, if at times unsuccessfully, the tough-talking swaggerurged by political advisers who want him to more clearly etchhis differences with Democrats.   White House officials and campaign aides expect Mr. Bushto straddle the two approaches in his speech. Competingadvisers are still lobbying to influence important details ofhis message, from the extent of capital gains tax cuts towhether to declare a deadline, somewhere from 30 to 60 days,for congressional action.   Mr. Bush has refused, however, to heed the advice of manyconservative advisers who have urged him to disassociatehimself from the constraints of the 1990 budget agreement, aswell as from the architect of that agreement, Budget DirectorRichard Darman. These conservatives grouse that thepresident's misguided attachment to the five-year budget dealhas forced him to reject bigger tax cuts for children and forcapital gains.   &quot;The president is about to go into battle with a hugemillstone around his neck, which his top advisers haveconvinced him is a coat of armor,&quot; says conservativeRepublican Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota.   Caught in the middle of the war between conservatives andMr. Darman is Samuel Skinner, White House chief of staff.When he took over the job late last year, Mr. Skinner wasinclined to agree with those who argued that the budgetagreement should be scrapped, according to top administrationofficials. But the president has since made it clear that hesides with Mr. Darman, and wants to adhere to that agreementas much as possible.   Things could get even worse for conservatives. Aides sayMr. Bush has not flatly ruled out compromise on a provisionthat Democrats are sure to include as the price of a taxbill: some sort of tax increase on the wealthy. &quot;There'sgenuine indecision how that end-game would be played,&quot; says asenior administration official. Democratic strategists say aBush veto of such an increase would hand them a potent&quot;fairness&quot; issue for the fall campaign.   The president's skill is resolving these questions ofpolicy and tactics is sure to affect the success of thepublic-relations blitz that will follow the address, acoordinated campaign of travel and speechmaking by Mr. Bush,Vice President Quayle, cabinet members, and GOP officialsacross the country.   Nationwide, the Journal/NBC poll shows that Mr. Bushcontinues to enjoy a wide lead, 74% to 13%, over hisconservative challenger, commentator Patrick Buchanan, amongRepublicans and independents. But polls in conservative,economically distressed New Hampshire have suggested that Mr.Buchanan could win 30% or more of the Feb. 18 GOP primaryvote there. That would be a serious embarrassment to thepresident, underscoring his potential vulnerability in theNovember general election unless the economy swings upwardbetween now and then.   That vulnerability is apparent in the nationwideJournal/NBC poll when voters are asked whether they currentlyplan to vote for Mr. Bush or for the eventual Democraticnominee, whoever it is. In a Journal/NBC survey in July, Mr.Bush enjoyed a 24 percentage point lead over such a &quot;generic&quot;Democrat. But in the new poll, that lead has shrunk to onlyeight points.   When pitted in trial heats against the five majorDemocratic candidates, the president fares better, largelybecause they mostly still remain unknown to large swatches ofthe electorate.   Against the strongest Democrat, Arkansas Gov. BillClinton, Mr. Bush leads by 52% to 35%. But that margin isless than half that by which the president led Mr. Clinton asrecently as October. Mr. Clinton, who has gained muchnational media attention recently as the putative frontrunnerfor the nomination, is moving up in public awareness; whileonly a third of voters had heard of him in December, nearlyhalf have heard of him now, and view him positively by amargin of 22% to 8%.   Matched against the other Democratic candidates, Mr. Bushleads both Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey and former CaliforniaGov. Jerry Brown by 55% to 30%; Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, 57% to26%; and former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas, 58% to 26%.But only Mr. Brown is known to more than half of the votersright now, and a plurality of those who know of him say theyhave negative feelings toward him.   For Mr. Bush, meanwhile, the poll finds that for the firsttime in his presidency, fewer than half of those surveyed,49%, have a positive opinion of him, while 33% view himnegatively.</TEXT></DOC>
