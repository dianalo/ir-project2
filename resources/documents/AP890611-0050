They said Iranians living in exile in Europe and the UnitedStates have flocked to Iraq to join the National Liberation Army ofIran since Khomeini's death June 3.   The National Liberation Army is the military wing of theMujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, the main Iranianopposition group.   Thousands of exiled sympathizers were immediately sent to rebelbases along the Iran-Iraq border for training, according to amujahedeen spokesman.   ``A stream of our supporters has been pouring in and they arebeing given proper training in our bases here,'' said FaridSuliamani, a spokesman for the Baghdad-based organization. He didnot give figures on new recruits.   Witnesses said dozens of military vehicles carrying rebelfighters were seen Thursday and Friday near northern Suliamaniyaheading toward rebel camps on the border with Iran. The vehicles hadFarsi markings and bore mujahedeen emblems, they said.   Border camps were closed after a United Nations cease-fire haltedthe eight-year Iran-Iraq war on Aug. 20. The Mujahedeen foughtalongside Iraq in the war and also halted operations inside Iranfollowing the truce.   But rebel leaders put their forces _ estimated at 20,000 _ onalert after Khomeini underwent surgery May 23 to stop intestinalbleeding.   After the patriarch's death, opposition leader Massoud Rajavicalled on Iranians to prepare to welcome the rebels and help themwhen they move into Iran ``at the appropriate moment.'' Rebel campswere reopened in a show of force, diplomats said.   The diplomatic sources spoke on the condition they not beidentified.   But there has been no indication that the rebels are planningmilitary action.   Military analysts do not believe the rebels are strong enough totopple the Iranian government alone unless a power struggledevelops. And despite earlier indications of factional fighting,Iran's new leader, President Ali Khamenei seems to be consolidatinghis position, sources said.   In addition, any military move would need approval from the Iraqigovernment. It is thought unlikely that Baghdad would permit anyaction that might jeopardize the temporary truce with Iran or impedeprogress in deadlocked peace talks.   One diplomat said although it was unlikely the rebels would moveacross the border while the cease-fire holds they might takeadvantage of any serious truce violation to attack Iranian positionsor set up rebel bases inside Iran. Mujahedeen officials said thegroup's military strength has increased steadily since thecease-fire and that months of intensive training in Iraq have madeit ``a far more effective military force than before.''   The rebels were allied with Khomeini in the struggle to topplethe late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. But in 1980-81, a year afterKhomeini took power, he turned on the group and other leftistfactions, killing and imprisoning tens of thousands of people.</TEXT></DOC>
