Spark plug leads from a      DIS four stroke engine are grouped together depending on their respective      firing polarity. A first signal pickup is placed around the spark plug      leads from the spark plugs of one signal polarity, for example a positive      signal polarity, and a second signal pickup is placed around the spark      plug leads from the spark plugs of opposite polarity, for example a      negative signal polarity. A trigger pickup is placed around the #1      cylinder spark plug lead. The voltage waveforms received in the signal      pickups are applied to the ignition adapter, summed and displayed on the      oscilloscope as a conventional voltage waveform. The polarity of the      waveform can be reversed using a polarity switch. The waveform received in      the trigger pickup is applied to the ignition adapter and compared to a      reference voltage. When the waveform exceeds the reference voltage, a      voltage pulse is applied to the oscilloscope as a trigger pulse. The      ignition adapter includes a trigger adjust that can be set to trigger the      oscilloscope on the higher voltage levels present during the compression      stroke of the DIS four stroke engine, thereby to emulate a conventional      voltage waveform. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAR>  The present invention relates to an ignition adapter for DIS four stroke      engines to provide conventional voltage waveforms for diagnostic      oscilloscopes. More particularly, the invention relates to variably      selecting the voltage trigger threshold from the #1 spark plug lead to      provide a conventional voltage waveform on a diagnostic oscilloscope for      DIS four stroke engines. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND </PAC><PAR>  Ignition adapters are typically used to adapt the spark plug firing      patterns in a DIS four stroke engine to a voltage waveform for display on      an oscilloscope. The voltage waveform is then used for diagnostic testing      of the ignition system in the engine. In the DIS four stroke engine, the      engine has a series of double-ended coils, where each coil fires two spark      plugs simultaneously. Each coil is coupled through an ignition module to a      timing circuit, which is generally included within an on-board computer.      The timing circuit, through the ignition module, provides a voltage spike      in the coil. When the voltage through the coil rises, a first spark plug      fires on a compression stroke and ignites an air/fuel mixture in a first      cylinder, while a second spark plug fires on an exhaust stroke but does      not ignite an air/fuel mixture in a second cylinder. </PAR><PAR>  Conventional diagnostic oscilloscopes are designed to display voltage      waveforms for conventional four stroke engines, which sequentially fire a      series of spark plugs. However, conventional oscilloscopes do not provide      the proper waveform for DIS four stroke engines in part because of the      above-mentioned design of the double-ended coils. Accordingly,      conventional oscilloscopes must be modified, for example with an ignition      adapter, to provide a proper voltage waveform for DIS four stroke engines. </PAR><PAR>  The ignition adapter may comprise for example, an electronic circuit      inserted between an on-board computer and the leads to the spark plugs, as      shown in Friedline et.al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,644,284. The electronic circuit      in Friedline is adapted to generate modified timing signals based on      commands from an engine analyzer to fire the spark plugs. Friedline shows      secondary signals from the #1, #3 and #5 spark plugs, and from the #2, #4      and #6 spark plugs separately received in the circuit, and converted to a      voltage waveform for display on an engine analyzer. The circuit monitors      the exhaust and compression stroke firings from the #1 spark plug in a      first, inductive pickup, and monitors the compression stroke firings in      the #1, #3 and #5 spark plugs in a second pickup. The signals are combined      and trigger the engine analyzer on the firing of the spark plug during the      compression stroke. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, Sniegowski et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,847,563 discloses a      relatively complicated method of providing a conventional voltage waveform      on an engine analyzer. A series of six pickups are attached to the spark      plug leads to measure the spark plug firing patterns. Sniegowski initially      determines the firing sequence for all cylinders and their corresponding      signal polarities using a microprocessor. The spark plug leads are sorted      depending on their polarity into a first group having negative waveforms,      and a second group having positive waveforms. The first group signals are      applied through a secondary output for display on an engine analyzer,      while the second group signals are inverted before being displayed. </PAR><PAR>  The Sniegowski circuit is triggered by a seventh inductive pickup placed      around the #1 spark plug lead from the engine. The microprocessor is      triggered during both the compression stroke and the exhaust stroke. The      microprocessor divides by two the number of #1 signals generated, and      applies the signals to the engine analyzer at the proper time during the      secondary waveform parade. </PAR><PAR>  The prior art ignition adapters attempt to provide conventional firing      patterns for DIS engine diagnostic testing. However, the prior art      circuits can require complicated electronics and many do not allow for      flexible control of the trigger level to compensate for variable voltage      levels in the circuit. Moreover, the prior art circuits can require      cumbersome hookup procedures and significant expense in purchasing and      maintaining the diagnostic equipment. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention provides a new ignition adapter and associated      circuitry for use with distributorless ignition systems. The ignition      adapter and associated circuitry provides for displaying conventional      voltage waveforms on a diagnostic oscilloscope. The ignition adapter      includes relatively simple electronics and allows for the flexible control      of the trigger level to compensate for variable voltage levels in the      circuit. Additionally, the ignition adapter is relatively simple to hookup      and inexpensive to purchase and maintain. </PAR><PAR>  According to one aspect of the invention, the ignition adapter comprises an      electronic circuit having a trigger pickup, signal pickups, power leads      and oscilloscope leads. The ignition adapter further includes a polarity      switch to provide proper ignition patterns on the oscilloscope, and a      trigger adjust knob to provide a stable picture of the correct number of      spark plug firings on the oscilloscope for DIS four stroke engines. </PAR><PAR>  The power leads to the ignition adapter are connected to the positive and      negative terminals of the vehicle battery to supply power to the ignition      adapter. The signal pickups are placed around the spark plug leads from      the engine to capacitively sense the voltage waveform in the leads. The      trigger pickup is placed around the #1 cylinder spark plug lead to trigger      the oscilloscope on the compression stroke of the #1 cylinder. The      oscilloscope leads provide the oscilloscope with a conventional voltage      waveform for diagnostic testing of DIS four stroke engines. </PAR><PAR>  The spark plug leads from the engine are grouped together depending upon      whether their respective spark plugs have the same firing polarity, e.g. a      positive or negative firing polarity. The spark plug leads for cylinders      with spark plugs having one signal polarity are grouped in a first signal      pickup, and the leads from cylinders with spark plugs of opposite polarity      are grouped in a second signal pickup. The actual firing polarity is      unimportant since the polarity of the groups can be reversed using the      polarity switch to provide the correct waveform polarity on the      oscilloscope. </PAR><PAR>  The signals received in the two signal pickups represent the positive and      negative voltage waveforms, respectively. The signals are each buffered      and fed to the positive and negative inputs of a differential amplifier,      where they are then summed. The single output of the differential      amplifier is amplified and applied to the oscilloscope screen as a      conventional voltage waveform. </PAR><PAR>  The oscilloscope is adapted to be triggered on the compression stroke of      the #1 spark plug cylinder in the DIS four stroke engine. A trigger adjust      knob allows variable selectivity of the threshold voltage received from      the trigger pickup for triggering the oscilloscope. The knob allows the      operator to select the relatively higher compression stroke voltage levels      present in the #1 spark plug lead for triggering the oscilloscope. </PAR><PAR>  Further features and advantages of the present invention will become      apparent from the following detailed description and the accompanying      drawings. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the ignition adapter schematically      illustrating the trigger pickup, signal pickups power leads and the      oscilloscope leads constructed according to the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of the electrical components of the      ignition adapter constructed in accordance with the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is an electrical circuit diagram of the trigger circuit component of      FIG. 2 constructed in accordance with the present invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4A and 4B are electrical circuit diagrams matched together as shown      to cooperatively illustrate the waveform generator circuit component of      FIG. 2. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Referring to the figures, and initially to FIG. 1, the ignition adapter      provided by the present invention is indicated generally by reference      numeral 10 and includes a conventional housing 11 enclosing an electronic      circuit, indicated generally at 12 (illustrated in FIG. 2), as described      herein in more detail. The ignition adapter includes two signal pickups,      indicated generally at 14 and 16 respectively, and a trigger pickup 20.      For a six cylinder car, the signal pickups are each clamped on three spark      plug lead wires to cooperatively sense voltage levels in all the spark      plug leads. The trigger pickup is clamped to the #1 spark plug lead wire      to sense the voltage levels in the #1 spark plug lead. The ignition      adapter also includes power leads 22 adapted to be attached to the      terminals of the vehicle battery 28. The ignition adapter further includes      oscilloscope output leads 24, 25 connected to the oscilloscope terminals      for providing the oscilloscope with conventional voltage waveforms from      the ignition adapter during spark plug firing in distributorless ignition      system (DIS) engines. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, as described herein in more detail, the ignition adapter includes      a polarity switch 30 and a trigger adjust knob 35 in contact with the      electronic circuit. The polarity switch has two alternate positions which      can be selected to provide the correct signal input to the oscilloscope.      The trigger adjust knob is variable to provide a stable pattern with the      correct number of spark plug firings on the oscilloscope. </PAR><PAR>  An internal combustion engine typically has a series of pistons      reciprocating within their respective cylinders. A four stroke engine has      (1) an intake stroke, (2) a compression stroke (3) a power stroke and (4)      an exhaust stroke. The cylinder pistons are in rotating engagement with a      crankshaft, which provides power for movement of the vehicle. </PAR><PAR>  On the intake stroke of the four stroke engine, the piston moves down the      cylinder and creates a vacuum above it in the cylinder head. A camshaft,      mechanically coupled to the crankshaft, causes an intake valve on the head      of the cylinder to open and an exhaust valve to close. The intake valve      delivers an air-fuel mixture from the carburetor to the respective      cylinder. When the piston begins to move upward in the cylinder during the      compression stroke, the intake valve closes and the fuel/air fuel mixture      is compressed. When the piston nears the upper end of the cylinder, the      spark plug fires and ignites the mixture. The rapid burning of the fuel      forces the piston downward during the power stroke. At the bottom of the      power stroke, the exhaust port opens and the exhaust gas flows out of the      port, assisted by the upwardly moving piston on the exhaust stroke. </PAR><PAR>  Later model engines can have a DIS four stroke engine. In the DIS four      stroke engine, the engine has a series of ignition coils. The secondary      windings of the coils each have two ends, wherein each end is connected to      a spark plug. The primary windings of the coils are coupled through an      ignition module to a timing circuit in an on-board computer. Current      flowing in the primary windings causes electro-magnetic lines of force to      cut across the secondary windings of the costs. A sudden collapse of      current in the primary windings causes by the ignition module creates an      induced voltage in the secondary windings, and thus provides a voltage      spike to the spark plug gap in both spark plugs. The first spark plug on      the secondary windings fires normally in a first cylinder that is on a      compression stroke and ignites an air/fuel mixture, while the second spark      plug simultaneously fires a &quot;waste spark&quot; in a second cylinder that is on      an exhaust stroke, but does not ignite an air/fuel mixture. </PAR><PAR>  The level of voltage supplied to a spark plug to cause it to fire is a      function of the dielectric strength in the spark plug gap. In a DIS four      stroke engine, when the cylinder is under compression, the dielectric      strength in the spark plug gap is high, and consequently a substantial      voltage is required to ignite the spark plug, typically in the 15 kilovolt      range. However, when the cylinder across the spark plug gap is lower and      the spark plug fires at a relatively low voltage, typically in the 1.5      kilovolt range. </PAR><PAR>  The two signal pickups 15, 16 are adapted to be placed around the spark      plug leads to capacitively sense the voltage in the leads. For example, in      a sic cylinder engine, as illustrated in FIG. 1, three ignition coils      having six leads provide voltage spikes to six spark plugs in the engine.      The two signal pickups are each clamped around three spark leads from the      engine. The first signal pickup 114 is clamped around three spark plug      leads that are connected to spark plugs that have the same signal      polarity, for example a positive firing sequence. The second signal pickup      16 is clamped around three spark plug leads that have the opposite signal      polarity, for example a negative firing sequence. However, this invention      is not limited to six cylinder engines, rather the same principles apply      to four or eight cylinder engines, wherein the two pickups will be clamped      around two or four spark plug leads each. </PAR><PAR>  When two spark plugs connected to the same coil are firing, the first      signal pickup will, for example, initially sense the higher voltage levels      that occur during the compression stroke of one cylinder, while the second      signal pickup will initially sense the lower voltage levels that occur      during the exhaust stroke of the companion cylinder. The voltage levels in      the first and second pickups will reverse amplitude as the cycle      progresses from compression to exhaust in the first cylinder, and from      exhaust to compression in the companion cylinder. </PAR><PAR>  Each signal pickup has two arms, for example as shown at 40, 41, adapted to      be clamped around a respective group of spark plug leads from the engine.      Each of the two arms includes a plate (not shown) pivotally mounted within      the arms. These opposed plates cooperate to capacitively sense the voltage      waveform in the leads. The plates are electrically connected together at      the base and have a lead extending therefrom to the ignition adapter. In      particular, lead 45 connects signal pickup 16 to the ignition adapter and      lead 46 connects signal pickup 14 to the ignition adapter. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, the trigger pickup 20 is adapted to be clamped around a      single spark plug lead, for example the #1 cylinder spark plug lead as      shown in FIG. 1. The trigger pickup is similar in construction t the two      signal pickups and is adapted to capacitively sense the voltage waveform      in the #1 spark plug lead. The trigger pickup is connected to an input to      the ignition adapter by lead 42. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 2, the electronic circuit 12 in the ignition adapter      includes a trigger circuit, indicated generally at 47, and a signal      processing circuit, indicated generally at 48. Both the signal processing      circuit and the trigger circuit are electronically connected to a power      supply indicated generally at 49. </PAR><PAR>  The signal processing circuit provides a conventional voltage waveform for      display on the oscilloscope, while the trigger circuit is adapted to      trigger the oscilloscope on the #1 spark plug firing during the      compression stroke in the engine. The power supply circuit is conventional      in design is constructed as a CD to CD converter to isolate the ignition      adapter from the vehicle battery and provide a variety of different DC      voltage levels for the circuit. In particular, the power supply circuit      provides separate -30 volt, andplus;14 volt, andplus;5.6 volt and -14 volt levels for      the circuit. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in more detail in FIG. 4A, the lead 45 from the first signal      pickup is applied to a first input to the signal processing circuit, and      the lead 46 from the second signal pickup 16 is applied to a second input      to the signal processing circuit. The input from each lead is applied to a      buffer, for example, the positive input to an op-amp. </PAR><PAR>  In particular, the input through lead 45 is initially applied in parallel      across one end of movistor 47, capacitor 48, and variable resistor 50. The      movistor 47 provides transient voltage suppression, while capacitor 48      provides filtering. Variable resistor 50 is initially calibrated during      manufacturing to properly scale the voltage waveform to present a proper      display on the oscilloscope. </PAR><PAR>  The input is then applied to resistor 51, which, in conjunction with diodes      54, 55, acts as a current limiting device to protect op-amp 52. Diode 54      is connected in a forward bias direction between resistor 51, the positive      input 52A to op-amp 52 and lead 59A to a positive supply voltage (andplus;14      volt). Diode 55 is similarly connected in a reverse bias direction between      resistor 51, the positive input 52A to op-amp 52 and lead 59B to a      negative supply voltage (-14 volt). Finally, capacitor 60 provides low      pass filtering for co-amp 52 and is connected to the positive input 52A to      op-amp 52. </PAR><PAR>  Lead 61 connects the other end of movistor 47, resistor 50 and capacitors      48, 60, and is connected to ground through lead 62. Lead 61 additionally      is connected to and grounds shield 63 on lead 45. </PAR><PAR>  Co-amps 52, 70 and 88 are formed on a conventional guard op-amp and are      supplied through leads 64 and 59A with a positive supply voltage (andplus;14v),      and through leads 80 and 59B with a negative supply voltage (-14B). Op-amp      52 is connected as a conventional source follower to provide unity gain,      high input impedance and low output impedance. The single output 65 from      op-amp 52 is connected to the negative input 52B, and is also applied      through lead 66 to the first contact of a polarity switch, indicated      generally at 67 in FIG. 4B. </PAR><PAR>  The input from lead 46 is connected in a similar arrangement as lead 45,      and is applied to op-amp 70. Specifically, the input is initially applied      in parallel across one end of movistor 71, capacitor 72, and variable      resistor 73. Ground lead 61 is connected to the other end of movistor 71,      capacitor 72 and variable resistor 73. Variable resistor 73 is similarly      initially calibrated during manufacturing to properly scale the voltage      waveform from display on an oscilloscope. </PAR><PAR>  The input to variable resistor 73 is then applied to resistor 74, which, in      conjunction with diodes 76, 77, protect op-amp 70. In particular, diode 76      is connected in a negative bias direction between resistor 74, the      positive input 70A to op-amp 70, and negative voltage supply lead 59B (-14      volts). Diode 77 is connected in the forward bias direction between      resistor 74, the positive input to op-amp 70, and voltage supply lead 59A      (andplus;14 volts). Capacitor 78 provides low pass filtering to op-amp 70 and is      connected between the positive input 70A to op-amp 70 and the ground lead      61. The ground lead 61 is also connects shield 79 on lead 46 to ground. </PAR><PAR>  Op-amp 70 is also connected as a conventional source follower. The single      output 81 from co-amp 70 is connected to the negative input 70B, and is      applied through lad 82 to the second contact of polarity switch 67. </PAR><PAR>  The polarity switch 67 is conventional in design and may, for example,      comprise a two-pole two position rocker switch. When the polarity switch      is in its first position as illustrated in FIG. 4B, wiper component 84A is      connected across leads 82 and 87. The output from op-amp 52 through leads      66 and 86 is applied to the positive input 88A of a differential amplifier      88 through resistor 90. The output from op-amp 70 through leads 82 and 87      is applied t the negative input 88B to the differential amplifier 88      through resistor 84. Resistor 96, connected in parallel with amplifier 88,      keeps the output of amplifier 88 at zero voltage during the switching of      polarity switch 67. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, when the polarity switch 80 is in a second position (not      shown), wiper component 84A is connected across leads 82 and 86, and wiper      component 84B is connected across leads 66 and 87. The output from op-amp      52 through lead 66 and 87 is applied to the negative input 88B of the      differential amplifier 88, while the output from op-amp 70 through leads      82 and 86 is applied to the positive input 88A to the differential      amplifier. Accordingly, polarity switch 88 can be moved from the first      position to the second position to reverse the polarity of the waveform      that enters the differential amplifier 88. </PAR><PAR>  The differential amplifier 88 sums the two waveforms received in the inputs      88A, 88B, and applies a single summed waveform from output 88C through      lead 97 to a buffer, indicated generally at 98. The differential amplifier      88 is conventional in design and the gain is controlled by resistors 90,      92 and resistors 94, 100. </PAR><PAR>  The buffer provides an amplified output waveform that is acceptable to an      analog oscilloscope. The buffer is conventional in design and includes      resistors 102 and 104, which determine the gain of the buffer. The buffer      has one pin tied to the power supply (andplus;5.6 volts) through lead 98A, and a      second pin tied to the power supply (-30.0 volts) through lead 98B. </PAR><PAR>  The buffered waveform is applied through lead 25 to a capacitive input 106      to the oscilloscope. Terminal 110 to the oscilloscope is typically      connected to ground. Shield 114 on lead 25 connects to terminal 110 of the      oscilloscope capacitive input and to the ground 112 of the ignition      adapter. Resistors 92, 104 are also connected to ground 112 of the      ignition adapter. </PAR><PAR>  The two signal pickups 14, 16, through ignition adapter 10, provide the      diagnostic oscilloscope with a conventional voltage waveform. The waveform      consists of the summed waveforms from the two signal pickups, representing      the voltage waveforms in the spark plug leads during the compression and      exhaust strokes. If the waveform on the oscilloscope is displayed with a      negative polarity, such as when the pickups are incorrectly applied to the      spark plug leads, the polarity switch 80 can be set such that the      conventional, positive voltage waveform is displayed on the oscilloscope. </PAR><PAR>  To trigger the waveform only on the #1 spark plug firing during the      compression stroke, the trigger pickup 20 is applied to the #1spark plug      lead, as shown in FIG. 1. The lead 42 from the trigger pickup extends to      the trigger circuit 47, as shown in FIG. 2. The trigger circuit comprises      similar electrical components and operates in much the same way as the      signal processor circuit 48. </PAR><PAR>  Specifically, as shown in FIG. 3, the trigger circuit includes movistor      122, capacitor 128, variable resistor 130 and resistor 132. The input from      the trigger pickup is applied in parallel to two identical comparators,      134, 136, connected on a dual comparator integrated circuit. Each      comparator compares the voltage waveform in the trigger pickup with a      selected reference voltage level. When the voltage waveform increases      above the reference voltage level, the comparator supplies a voltage pulse      to the oscilloscope, which is used to trigger the voltage waveform from      the signal pick-ups. </PAR><PAR>  Specifically, the input through lead 42 is applied across movistor 122 and      capacitor 128, and through variable resistor 130 and resistor 132 to lead      137 and the positive input 134A to comparator 134. The negative input 134B      of comparator 134 is connected by lead 140 to a positive voltage supply      (andplus;14V) through a resistor 139. The negative input 134B to comparator 134      is also connected to a ground lead 142 through resistor 143. Resistors 139      and 143 set the threshold level of comparator 134. Finally, comparator 134      has a pin connected through lead 154 to a positive voltage supply (andplus;14v)      and lead 155 to a negative voltage supply (-14v). Comparator 134 is      protected from voltage surges by resistor 132 and diodes 153, 156. </PAR><PAR>  A portion of the signal from lead 42 is applied through lead 138 to the      negative input 136B of comparator 136. Resistors 150, 151 set the      threshold level of comparator 136. The positive input 136A to comparator      136 is connected to a negative voltage supply (-14V) through resistor 151      and led 152, and to the ground lead 142 through resistor 150. Comparator      136 is connected to the positive voltage supply (andplus;14v) through led 154,      and a negative voltage supply (-14v) through lead 155. Comparator 136 is      surge protected by resistor 132 and diodes 153, 156. </PAR><PAR>  The outputs from the comparators 134, 136 are applied to lead 24 through      diodes 156, 158 respectively. Lead 24 is connected to an inductive input      159 to the oscilloscope. Diodes 156, 158 are forwardly biased and function      to isolate the two outputs of the two comparators. Additionally, resistors      160, 161 are connected to the output of comparators 134, 136, and a      positive supply voltage (andplus;14V). Finally, resistor 162 is connected between      the cathodes of diodes 156, 158 and the ground lead 142, and provides a      zero reference for the lead 24. An inductive input terminal 163 and a      shield 164 of lead 24 are connected to ground through lead 165.      Additionally, shield 166 on lead 42 is connected to a ground lead 142      through lead 167. </PAR><PAR>  The trigger circuit additionally includes a trigger level adjust, indicated      generally at 170. The trigger level adjust comprises knob 35 (FIG. 1) and      variable resistor 130 connected as a voltage divider. The variable      resistor can be manually controlled by knob 35 on the housing of the      ignition adapter to vary the trigger threshold. </PAR><PAR>  The variable resistor 130 is connected as a voltage divider, with the      voltage between the wiper and one end of the variable resistor 130      increasing or decreasing depending upon the position of knob 35.      Specifically turning the knob 35 in one direction decreases the trigger      voltage waveform, effectively increasing the trigger threshold for the      circuit. When a positive polarity voltage spike is sensed by the trigger      pickup, the negative input to comparator 134 is biased by resistors 139,      143 higher than the peak of the signal waveform received in the positive      input of comparator 134 and the output of the comparator will accordingly      be low. </PAR><PAR>  When the knob 35 is turned in the other direction, the trigger voltage      waveform is increased, which effectively decreases the trigger threshold      for the circuit. Consequently, the peak of the signal waveform received in      the positive input will be higher than the bias at the negative voltage      spikes occurring during the compression strokes are sensed by the pickup      20. Accordingly, the output of comparator 134 will be high, and when      applied to the inductive input to the oscilloscope, provides a triggering      pulse for the oscilloscope. </PAR><PAR>  Comparator 136 functions in much the same way as comparator 134, but      responds to negative polarity voltage signals received in lead 42. When      the trigger voltage waveform is decreased, the output of comparator 134 is      low. When the trigger voltage waveform is increased, the high voltage      levels during the compression stroke begin to switch the comparator 136      high and trigger the oscilloscope. </PAR><PAR>  Further increasing the trigger voltage waveform will begin driving the      comparator 134 (or 136) high on both the compression and exhaust stroke      voltage levels. Only one-half of the firing patterns will be displayed on      the oscilloscope screen. Accordingly, the trigger level can be varied so      that the waveform appearing on the oscilloscope is triggered only on the      higher voltage levels present during the compression stroke, and not on      the lower voltage levels present during the exhaust stroke in the DIS four      stroke engine. In this position, the correct number of ignition firings,      for example six for a six cylinder engine, will be displayed on the      oscilloscope screen. </PAR><PAR>  It is important to note that either a positive or negative polarity      waveform from the spark plug lead will trigger the oscilloscope. The      positive polarity waveforms will trigger comparator 134, while the      negative polarity waveforms will trigger comparator 136. Accordingly,      regardless of the polarity of the #1 spark plug lead, the trigger circuit      will still function properly. Consequently, the trigger circuit operates      independently of the polarity of the signal waveform in the trigger      pickup. </PAR><PAR>  The operation of the ignition adapter is as follows. The two signal pickups      14, 16 are clamped to the appropriate spark plug leads from the engine, as      described previously. The trigger pickup 20 is then clamped to the #1      cylinder spark plug lead from the engine. The power leads 22 of the power      supply circuit are connected to the positive and negative terminals of the      vehicle battery 27. Finally, lead 24 is applied to the inductive input to      the oscilloscope and lead 25 is applied to the capacitive input to the      oscilloscope. </PAR><PAR>  When the engine is running and the oscilloscope is turned on, a waveform      appears on the oscilloscope screen which represents the sum of the      compression and exhaust stroke voltage waveforms. If the waveform polarity      is negative, for example as indicated by the absence of high positive      spikes on the screen of the oscilloscope, the operator can use the      polarity switch 30 to reverse the polarity of the waveform and obtain a      conventional pattern. </PAR><PAR>  The trigger adjust knob 35 is then rotated fully in one direction, which      effectively increases the triggering threshold of the trigger circuit      above the higher voltage levels present during the compressions stroke.      However, the firing pattern on the oscilloscope screen is not synchronized      at this time. The knob 35 is then rotated slowly in the reverse direction      to get a stable picture with the correct number of spark plug firings,      which should be equal to the number of cylinders in the engine. </PAR><PAR>  Rotating the knob 35 in the reverse direction effectively lowers the      threshold level so that the circuit is triggered only on the compression      strokes. The knob is typically rotated in the reverse direction until only      half the spark plug firings are present on the oscilloscope, which      indicates that the voltage spikes from both the compression and exhaust      strokes are triggering the oscilloscope. Finally, the trigger adjust knob      356 is adjusted in the forward direction to approximately the midpoint      between where the stable firing pattern appeared on the oscilloscope and      where half the firings appeared on the oscilloscope, to obtain a stable      firing pattern of all the spark plugs in the DIS engine. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, the ignition adapter provides for displaying a conventional      analog waveform on an oscilloscope that represents the spark plug firings      in a DIS engine. The display can be manually set to trigger at variable      threshold levels, which makes the distributorless ignition adapter      uniquely suited for DIS engine systems where there is a higher compression      stroke voltage level and a lower exhaust stroke voltage level. The display      will be available to service personnel using a simple ignition adapter and      by a method that is convenient and accurate. Moreover, the electronics      employed in the circuit are relatively simple and inexpensive to purchase      and maintain. </PAR><PAR>  A table illustrating the preferred values of the components in the present      invention is shown below.
