DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Junk bond financier Michael R. Milken is asunlikely to receive a multibillion dollar fine as he is a 500-yearprison term, even if he is convicted on every count of a mammothracketeering and securities fraud indictment, a federal prosecutorsaid Thursday.   Milken, head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high yield bonddepartment, and two others were indicated Wednesday on charges theyturned Drexel into a racketeering enterprise that engaged insecurities violations ranging from insider trading to stock marketmanipulation.   All three were charged with racketeering and conspiring toviolate federal racketeering laws, which each carry a maximum20-year sentence upon conviction.   Milken, his brother Lowell and former Drexel trader BruceNewberg each face maximum fines of $3.7 billion if convicted oneither or both of the racketeering counts, said Assistant U.S.Attorney Bruce Baird.   Those fines represent the highest possible amounts under federalracketeering law _ that is, double the gains made from theallegedly illegal enterprise _ that a judge may impose.   The defendants also face fines of at least $250,000 and up tofive years imprisonment on each of the lesser charges of mail, wireand securities fraud. In Michael Milken's case, that's anadditional 96 counts or a total of $24 million more in fines and apossible 520 years imprisonment.   But Baird conceded such totals were ``unrealistic.''   ``Neither the possible maximum fine nor the possible maximumprison term is a penalty that the government expects will be fullyimposed,'' said Baird, head of the securities and commodities fraudunit at the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.   ``A fine, like a term of imprisonment, is something within thediscretion of the judge after conviction,'' said the prosecutor.For example, he added, for Milken a judge could impose either nojail time or the maximum 520 years upon conviction.   But based on past sentencing practices in other majorracketeering and securities cases, it appeared unlikely a judgewould impose the fullest possible penalties against the three,Baird indicated.   Far more realistic, said Baird, was that if the three wereconvicted of either racketeering count they would have to forfeit atotal of $1.85 billion in allegedly illegal gains made from theirenterprise.   Forfeiture is a penalty unique to the federal RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Baird said.   The $1.85 billion represents virtually all the money Milken andhis co-defendants made from their dealings with Drexel or fromtheir financial stake in Drexel from 1984 through 1987 _ the yearscovered by the indictment _ which is subject to forefeiture underthe federal racketeering law.   That includes all salaries and bonuses, totaling $1.2 billion;Drexel stock worth $112 million; $205 million in corporate financefees and $37.9 million in Drexel trading profits allegedly taintedby fraud.   Prosecutors also are seeking $257 million in interest.   Baird said the trial jury would decide whether to orderforfeiture after a racketeering conviction.   Baird said the government did not plan to seek a court orderfreezing the trio's assets.   ``We're going to give them an opportunity to post a bondfirst,'' said Baird. He said the bond would be like posting bailfor their assets ``to assure the assets will still be there in theevent of a conviction on the RICO charges.''</TEXT></DOC>
