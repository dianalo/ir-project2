Strikes and sheer mismanagement were blamed for the transportjam, which has exacerbated shortages and threatened to derailperestroika, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program.   Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov warned on national television Sundaynight that ``if things do not improve shortly, we'll have to taketough measures against leaders of all ranks.''   More than 2 million tons of cargo are piled up in Soviet portsfor lack of train transport, newspapers said. This includesthousands of containers of consumer goods and food purchased by thegovernment on an emergency basis to appease a public angered byempty store shelves.   Ryzhkov said the unloaded cargo included 25,000 tons of importedfood and that some of it was spoiling.   The news agency Tass reported that 1,700 trains were stalled forlack of coal, even though the country's first nationwide coalstrike ended two months ago. As of Wednesday, 100,000 railcars wereout of circulation, Tass said, quoting Railroad Minister NikolaiKonarev.   In the critical harvest season, key rail depots are clogged with180 cars of meat rotting in the Leningrad depots alone, media said.Incoming trains are waiting for unloading, and outgoing cargo ispiled up for lack of empty containers and railcars.   ``The work of the Leningrad rail center is effectivelyparalyzed,'' the daily Sovietskaya Rossiya reported Thursday. ``Allthe approaches to stations for dozens of kilometers around thecity, all the cargo yards and sorting stations are packed withunloaded freight cars.''   The Leningrad traffic jam began when Byelorussian farms beganshipping potatoes faster than the city's vegetable warehouses couldtake them in, the paper said. Rail authorities finally managed todeal with the glut of potatoes, but now refrigerated cars, oiltankers, auto-transport wagons and flatbed cars for containers arebacking up.   The Soviet Union has long had difficulty transporting itsharvest to storage and shops. Tass reported this week that 29million tons of grain, one million tons of meat and 25 percent ofvegetables are lost each year between field and table.   This year, the annual difficulties are exacerbated by strikes inthe Caucasus and Moldavia regions spawned by ethnic conflicts.Trains have not run for 18 days in Moldavia in a language dispute,said Tass, quoting Valentin Tetenov, a legislator who heads theSupreme Soviet transportation committee.   Rail traffic to Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, was halted fromSept. 5 to Sept. 17, and sporadically since then, in an economicblockade mounted by Azerbaijanis as part of the lengthy disputeover rights to the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.   Rail officials apparently continued to load trains and send themto Armenia even though they knew the line was closed, because atone point, 400 trains were reported stuck on the tracks to Yerevan.   Moscow's Smolensk Cargo Depot was piled high with containersSunday afternoon, including some shipped from West Germany nearlyfive weeks ago and one sent from Hungary in June. The lone workeron the scene said factories were not sending trucks to pick uptheir shipments.   ``Who knows why?'' he shrugged.   In the Vladimir region, 300 containers are stacked in the raildepot, because so many trucks have broken down for lack of spareparts. The critical parts are somewhere in the mountain of cargo,the news program Vremya said Saturday.   The Ukraine has closed one sugar beet processing plant and mayhave to close 30 more at the height of the harvest because thewarehouses are full and there are no railcars to haul the sugar,the labor newspaper Trud reported Sunday. Sugar is rationed in theSoviet Union, primarily because it is used for making moonshine.   Trud quoted the head of the Ukrainian Council of Trade Unions,V. Sologub, as saying 280,000 tons of cargo has piled up at theport in Odessa, and factory workers are being drafted intostevedore duty.</TEXT></DOC>
