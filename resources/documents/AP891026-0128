The remarks of Karim Masiq, the mayor of Kabul and member of theCentral Committee of the ruling People's Democratic Party, were thefirst time a government official has openly criticized Moscow'sdecision to send troops to Afghanistan.   Masiq, in a wide-ranging interview with Western reporters, alsosaid his party, which for years has adhered to Marxist economicpolicies, now wants the private sector to expand and help saveAfghanistan's people from starvation.   Even private merchants selling stolen goods will not beprosecuted, he said, ``because they are still involved in bringingnecessary goods to the market.''   Masiq, a former political prisoner and short-story writer, wasappointed Wednesday to the Central Committee as the ruling partyheld its first plenum since Soviet troops withdrew in February.Unlike last year's meeting, when security forces rounded uphundreds of members of opposing political factions, this year'splenum exuded an atmosphere of intra-party unity, diplomats said.   On Monday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze saidMoscow's invasion of Afghanistan was illegal and violated ``cvilnorms and ethics.'' Masiq agreed with that and called the incursionimmoral.   ``It is very clear that it was unnecessary,'' Masiq said. ``Andit is only natural that the Afghanistan people would defend againstthe Soviet force.''   Significantly, Masiq did not criticize the United States orother countries for aiding the Moslem guerrillas, known as themujahedeen, or ``holy warriors,'' during the Soviet involvement.But he said they were wrong to continue supporting the rebels afterthe Soviets left Afghanistan.   ``There are no mujahedeen now,'' Masiq said. ``We are themujahedeen.''   He said that although many factors have hurt Afghanistan, theSoviet military presence had added to the problems in this poorcountry.   Although Masiq is the first government official to openlycriticize the Soviet incursion, other public figures have done sorecently. Tuesday night, a leading religious figure told state-runTV he thought the intervention was wrong. A group of formerofficials who served under the deposed King Zahir Shah have madesimilar statements.   The campaign appears to be part of President Najib's attempts tobroaden the base of his government among a people who stronglyopposed the Soviet military presence and have little love forMoscow.   Masiq is a member of the Khalq, or masses, faction of the rulingparty. In 1979, he was on the Central Committee and thepolicy-making Politburo when the Soviet troops entered Afghanistan.   Khalq forces, who came to power in 1978 in a military-backedcommunist coup, opposed the Soviet incursion. Many faction members,including Masiq, were jailed.   Since the Soviet withdrawal, the government of Najib, who leadsthe Parcham, or flag, faction, has rehabilitated leading Khalqmembers in an attempt to heal the party rift and improve relationswith the military.   Khalq has traditionally held sway among the armed forces whileParcham is strong among intellectuals.   Masiq was recently released from house arrest and appoined mayorof Kabul. His appointment to the Central Committee was another moveat at peace-making.   In the interview, Masiq said the government would welcome allformer rebels and help them get settled. He said even mercenarieswho became rich by selling weapons and using the money to buy landwould be helped.   ``The state supports all these poeple because they are tired ofwar,'' he said. ``It is better than rockets.''</TEXT></DOC>
