(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A winged rocket built tobe launched from under the wing of an airplane and carry smallsatellites into orbit at low cost was shown off Thursday in advanceof a flight test program.   The gleaming white, 49-foot-long Pegasus, named after themythological winged horse, was rolled out of a hangar at NASA'sAmes-Dryden Flight Research Facility as 400 guests watched and ahigh school band played.   Pegasus ``will not only open up new horizons in low-cost,innovative uses of space, but also confirms once more America'sleadership in space technology,'' said Antonio Elias, chiefengineer of the rocket project.   Noting its adaptation of technology from military missiles,Elias declared Pegasus ``a noteworthy example of swords turned intoplowshares.''   The three-stage rocket was developed as a joint venture byOrbital Sciences Corp. and Hercules Aerospace Co., which estimatePegasus rockets can put satellites into space at a cost of $6million to $8 million per launch.   The rocket that was rolled out for the ceremony will be carriedaloft under the wing of a NASA B-52 for test flights later thismonth and in early October, but won't be launched.   Later in October, another Pegasus will be released from a B-52about 40,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean off the California coast.The builders plan to buy or lease planes to launch future rockets.   Bob Lovell, vice president of the Space Applications Division atOrbital Sciences, said the company is certain there is a market forthe rocket.   ``We believe that we'll be launching one of these a monthbeginning in about 1991, and ultimately we hope to go as high astwo a month. That market, we think, will be split roughly equallybetween Department of Defense missions and commercial missions,''he said.   The military is interested because of the ability to launchPegasus quickly in reacting to such events as the Grenada invasion,said Air Force Lt. Col. Ed Nicastri, from the Defense AdvancedResearch Projects Agency.   ``If we wanted to get more communications into that area, wecould quickly launch communications satellites,'' Nicastri said. Aconventional launch would take about 30 days' notice, he said.   Launch costs for military payloads average $120 million on aspace shuttle, about $100 million for a Titan launch, and some $40million for a Delta-class launch, Nicastri said.   However, space shuttles, Titans and Deltas can carry much biggerand heavier payloads than the Pegasus.   The companies announced in June that their first commercialcustomer is Ball Corp. Under an agreement, Pegasus rockets will beused to launch two Ball communications satellites in 1990 or 1991.   The NASA B-52 will be used for the flight tests, but thebuilders will lease or buy planes to launch future rockets forother clients.</TEXT></DOC>
