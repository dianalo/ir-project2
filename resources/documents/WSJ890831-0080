Beginning with its January 1990 issue, 11-year-old American Photographer will change its name to American Photo, decrease its frequency to bimonthly from monthly, increase its page size and upgrade its paper stock. David Schonauer, editor of American Photographer, said the new magazine will focus on &quot;event issues&quot; with 25% more editorial pages, carrying more photographs as well as expanded columns and departments.    While publishers frequently redesign magazines, it is rare for them to change the name and frequency of an existing publication. American Photographer is successful, but its circulation has been relatively flat in recent years at about 250,000. Peter Diamandis, chief executive of DCI, said the creation of American Photo is an attempt to lure new readers and attract advertisers such as automotive companies while retaining American Photographer's current advertisers, largely high-end photography product makers.    Diamandis, a unit of French publisher Hachette S.A., is the leading publisher of popular photography magazines in the U.S. In late May, DCI purchased Modern Photography magazine from ABC Publishing and folded it, combining its trademark and subscription list with its own Popular Photography magazine. The company also publishes Elle magazine in the U.S., Woman's Day, and other magazines.    Mr. Schonauer said each issue of American Photo will have &quot;a dominating or special theme with photo stories by the world's leading photographers.&quot; By creating &quot;something close to a coffee table photo magazine,&quot; he added, &quot;we are reaching out to a wider audience that wants to look at great pictures and to remain a showcase for photographers.&quot;    Advertising rates and the magazine's cover and subscription prices are expected to be changed and will be announced later.    The change in publishing frequency, Mr. Schonauer said, would allow the magazine to &quot;concentrate the resources of the product . . . we want the topics to be significant and the coverage to be complete.&quot; Some possible event issues could be on a city, a country, or based on a theme such as sports or war photography.    While a step down in the frequency usually means a magazine is in trouble and is looking to cut publishing costs, Diamandis executives say that isn't the case. For the first six months of 1989, the magazine's advertising revenue totaled $2.7 million, an increase of 18% from the same period in 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
