On July 23, 1987, the Commission adopted final rules governing the domesticoffer and sale of commodity futures and option contracts traded on or subjectto the rules of a foreign board of trade. 52 FR 28980 (August 5, 1987).These rules, which are codified in Part 30 of the Commission's regulations,generally extend the Commission's existing customer protection regulationsfor products offered or sold on contract markets in the United States toforeign futures and option products sold to United States customers byimposing requirements with respect to registration, disclosure, capitaladequacy, protection of customer funds, recordkeeping and reporting, andsales practice and compliance procedures that are generally comparableto those applicable to wholly domestic transactions. In formulating a regulatory program to govern the offer and sale of foreignfutures and option products to United States customers, among other things,the Commission considered the desirability of ameliorating the potentialextraterritorial impact of such a program and avoiding duplicative regulationof firms engaged in international business. Based upon these considerations,the Commission, as set forth in Commission Rule 30.10, determined to permitpersons<T3> located outside the United States</T3> and subject to a comparableregulatory structure in the jurisdiction in which they were located toseek an exemption from certain of the requirements imposed by the Part30 rules based upon substituted compliance with the comparable regulatoryrequirements imposed by the foreign jurisdiction. Appendix A to Part 30, ``Interpretative Statement With Respect to theCommission's Exemptive Authority Under andSection; 30.10 of Its Rules'' (``AppendixA''), generally sets forth the elements the Commission will evaluate indetermining whether a particular regulatory program may be found to becomparable for purposes of exemptive relief pursuant to Commission Rule30.10, 52 FR 28980, 29001. These elements include: (1) Registration, authorizationor other form of licensing, fitness review or qualification of personsthrough whom customer orders are solicited and accepted; (2) minimum financialrequirements for those persons who accept customer funds; (3) protectionof customer funds from misapplication; (4) recordkeeping and reportingrequirements; (5) sales practice standards; (6) procedures to audit forcompliance with, and to take action  against those persons who violate,the requirements of the program; and (7) information sharing arrangementsbetween the Commission and the appropriate governmental and/or self-regulatoryorganization to ensure Commission access on an ``as needed'' basis to informationessential to maintaining adequate standards of customer and market protectionwithin the United States. Moreover, the Commission specifically stated in adopting Commission Rule30.10 that no exemption of a general nature would be granted unless thepersons to whom the exemption is to be applied: (1) Consensually submitto jurisdiction in the United States by designating an agent for serviceof process in the United States with respect to transactions subject toPart 30 and filing a copy of the agency agreement with the National FuturesAssociation (``NFA''); (2) agree to provide access to their books and recordsin the United States to Commission and Department of Justice representatives;and (3) notify the NFA of the commencement or termination of business inthe United States.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 52 FR 28980, 28981 and 29002. By letter dated March 4, 1988, the Exchange petitioned the Commissionon behalf of certain of its members for an exemption from the applicationof the Commission's foreign futures and option rules. In support of itspetition, the Exchange states that granting such an exemption with respectto its members would not be contrary to the public interest or to the purposesof the provisions from which the exemption is sought because such firms  and the Exchange are subject to a regulatory scheme under the QuebecSecurities Act which is comparable to that imposed by the Commodity ExchangeAct (``Act'') and the regulations thereunder. Based upon a review of the petition, supporting materials filed by theExchange, its regulatory authority, the Commission des valeurs Mobilieresdu Quebec (``CVMQ''), and the recommendation of the staff, the Commissionhas concluded that the standards for relief set forth in Commission Rule30.10 and, in particular, Appendix A thereof, have generally been satisfiedand that compliance with applicable Canadian law and Exchange rules maybe substituted for compliance with those sections of the Act more particularlyset forth herein. By this Order, the Commission hereby exempts, subject to specified conditions,those firms identified to the Commission as eligible for the relief grantedherein from:<ITAG tagnum="15">_ Registration with the Commission;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_ The requirement in Commission Rule 30.6(d), 17 CFR 30.6(d) (1988),that firms provide customers resident in the United States with the optionsrisk disclosure statement in Commission Rule 33.7, 17 CFR 33.7 (1988);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Those sections of Part 1 of the Commission's financial regulationsthat apply to foreign futures and options sold in the United States asset forth in Part 30; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_ Those sections of Part 1 of the Commission's regulations relatingto books and records which apply to transactions subject to Part 30;</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"> based upon substituted compliance by such persons with the applicablestatutes and regulations in effect in the province of Quebec. This determination to permit substituted compliance is based on, amongother things, the Commission's finding that the regulatory scheme governingthe persons in Quebec who would be exempted hereunder provides: (1) A system of licensing of firms and persons who deal in transactionssubject to regulation under Part 30 that includes, for example, criteriaand procedures for granting, monitoring, suspending and revoking licenses,and provisions for requiring and obtaining access to information aboutlicensees; (2) Financial requirements for firms carrying customer accounts including,without limitation, a requirement that all firms immediately notify theExchange if the firms' adjusted net capital falls below a specified leveland daily mark-to-market settlement; (3) A system for the protection of customer funds which requires separateaccounting for such funds, augmented by a compensation fund designed tocompensate customers who have suffered a loss as a result of fraud and/orinsolvency of a licensee; (4) Recordkeeping and reporting requirements pertaining to financial andtrade information including, without limitation, order tickets, trade confirmations,monthly customer account statements, accounting records for customer andproprietary trades and discretionary account documentation; (5) Sales practice standards for licensees which include, for example,a requirement that firms licensed to do business know their customers,required disclosures to prospective customers and prohibitions on misleadingadvertising and improper trading activities; (6) Procedures to audit for compliance with, and to redress violationsof, customer protection and sales practice requirements including, withoutlimitation, an affirmative surveillance program designed to detect tradingactivities which take advantage of customers, and the existence of broadpowers of investigation relating to sales practice abuses; and (7) Mechanisms for sharing of information between the Commission, the Exchangeand the CVMQ on an ``as needed'' basis including, without limitation, confirmationdata, data necessary to trace funds related to trading futures and optionproducts subject to regulation in Quebec, position data and data on firms'standing to do business and financial condition. This Order does not provide an exemption from any provision of the Actor regulations thereunder not specified herein, for example, without limitation,the antifraud provision in Commission Rule 30.9, 17 CFR 30.9 (1988), orthe disclosure provision in Commission Rule 30.6(a), 17 CFR 30.6(a) (1988).Moreover, the relief granted is directed to brokerage activities on orsubject to the rules of the Exchange undertaken by Exchange member firmsauthorized to do investment business in Quebec. The relief does not extendto rules or regulations relating to trading, directly or indirectly, onUnited States exchanges. For example, such a firm trading in United Statesmarkets for its own account would be subject to the Commission's largetrader reporting requirements. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>17 CFR Part 18 (1988). Similarly, if such a firm werecarrying a position on a United States exchange on behalf of foreign clients,it would be subject to the reporting requirements applicable to foreignbrokers. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>17 CFR Parts 17 and 21 (1988). The relief herein isinapplicable where the firm solicits United States customers for transactionson United States markets.
