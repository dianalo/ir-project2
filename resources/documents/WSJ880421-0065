The transaction will allow closely held Emmis to switch its New York rock-music station WQHT to WYNY's signal, 97.1 on the dial from 103.5, which will be WYNY's new dial location. &quot;It's considered better for us to be lower on dial,&quot; said Emmis President Jeff Smulyan.    This is the first radio station acquisition for Westwood One, a Culver City, Calif., radio-program producer and distributor.    Emmis agreed this year to acquire WYNY-FM as part of a purchase of five radio stations for $121.5 million from National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co. The accord called for Emmis to purchase New York station WNBC-AM as well, which would give it four New York stations. It already owned WFAN-AM, an all-sports station, and WQHT. A company can own only two stations in a market. Emmis must decide which of its three remaining New York stations to sell. </TEXT></DOC>
