KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee clearedthe way Wednesday for an early vote to endorse the new armsreduction treaty with the Soviet Union after a series of lopsidedtallies against amendments proposed by the pact's chief opponent,Sen. Jesse Helms.   Helms, R-N.C., had introduced a series of 36 amendments to theaccord. But he agreed to press for substantive action on just fourof them after Republican and Democratic senators accused him ofobstruction and deliberately engineering a series of delays.   Committee chairman Claiborne Pell, R-R.I., announced the panelwill vote next Tuesday afternoon on reporting the treaty to theSenate floor with a favorable recommendation.   Pell had promised to keep the committee in lengthy session todispose of the Helms amendments, none of which had attracted morethan three votes among the 19 committee members.   Helms's reversal of course came after a morning session of thepanel in which Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., complained: ``We're justin a delay, stall situation which I find disagreeable.''   ``If you don't have the votes and just try to overload it withamendments, that isn't fair,'' Lugar said shortly before thecommittee defeated the first of the Helms amendments, 12-3.   ``I don't know what is the magical effect of racing to get thisthing reported'' to the Senate floor, Helms said at that point.   Meanwhile, Pell and several other key committee members said thelast major factor complicating Senate consideration of the newagreement banning U.S. and Soviet medium-range missiles is thedispute between Congress and the Reagan administration over theinterpretation of treaties.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, seeks to add language to the treaty text declaring theSenate's understanding that administration testimony about thecontents and impact of the accord is authoritative and binding.   The dispute stems from the administration's earlierreinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty topermit the deployment of a Star Wars missile defense system whichmost arms control treaty experts believed had been effectivelybanned.   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., told the Senateon Wednesday he has concluded it will be essential to attach areservation or understanding to the pact spelling out the Senate'sposition.   Byrd said that while there have been exchanges of letters on howthe treaty should be interpreted, ``this matter is not going to beresolved, in my judgment, by any exchange of letters, because afuture administration can say ... `We don't agree with thatinterpretation at all.'''   The initial 12-3 committee vote rejected a Helms amendment whichwould have changed the treaty to permit the United States to deploya ground-launched cruise missile armed with conventional and notnuclear explosives.   Only Sens. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., and Frank Murkowski,R-Alaska, joined Helms in supporting the amendment.   Adopting the amendment would mean reopening negotiations withthe Soviets, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said. ``And that wouldmean we would plainly not get a treaty anytime soon. So this canfairly be labled as a killer amendment.''   He said conventionally armed cruise missiles were included inthe pact because it is impossible to differentiate them fromidentical weapons armed with nuclear warheads.   With the conventionally armed missiles excluded, the treatywould not be verifiable, Cranston said.   But Helms said the ban means ``the conventional imbalance inEurope will be even greater than it is now'' because NATO will losea major weapon in the cruise missile.   However, Helms later relented, the Tuesday vote was set, and thecommittee overwhelmingly rejected three amendments, all of whichwere described by opponents as having the potential to kill thetreaty by forcing the reopening of negotiations with the Soviets.   An amendment by Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D ., which would havedelayed implementation of the treaty until negotiations reducedSoviet surperiority in conventional arms in Europe also wasrejected, 15-2.   Both Democratic and Republican leaders predict overwhelmingratification when the treaty reaches the Senate floor and say only10 or 12 members of the 100-member Senate are likely to vote toreject it. Ratification requires a two-thirds vote.</TEXT></DOC>
