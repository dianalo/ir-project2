He said in an interview with Iran's state-run television,monitored in Nicosia, that a major discovery was made at Koohe Mandsoutheast of the northern Persian Gulf port of Bushehr.   ``We have hit light and heavy crude (oil), and have discoveredsubstantial deposits of oil totalling 10 billion barrels,'' Aqazadehsaid.   ``This is a new kind of discovery for our country, because wehave found very heavy crude of a kind which we did not have.''   The oil discoveries will bolster Iran's efforts to finance itsreconstruction following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in its gulf war withIraq.   The Koohe Mand discovery will increase Iran's current estimatedoil reserves of 93 billion barrels by more than 10 percent.   Aqazadeh said that in addition to oil, a recent discovery of``vast deposits of natural gas in Assaluyeh ... will boost ournatural gas reserves substantially.''   The Iranian Oil Ministry disclosed in August that the gas find,about 44 miles southeast of the big Kangan-Nar gas fields in thecentral gulf, has a production capacity of 26 million cubic meters aday.   ``There might be further reserves deeper down,'' Aqazadeh noted.   Iran's total gas reserves are estimated at more than 13 trillioncubic meters.   Aqazadeh said additional oil exploration projects were underwayin the Caspian Sea in northern Iran, as well as in the gulf. TheIranians are likely to develop Caspian fields in cooperation withthe Soviet Union.   He said ``work on the bottom of the Caspian Sea has also beencompleted, and we hope to have a rig in place by next year incooperation with the Soviets. Soon after that, we hope to start ourdrilling operations there.''   Aqazadeh also referred to another recent oil find in Kheyrabad incentral Fars province, southeast of Shiraz.   ``Preliminary exploration has put the capacity of the Kheyrabadfind at 200 million barrels of oil a day,'' he said. ``Due to thehigh pressure of the deposits there, the first well should yieldabout 400,000 barrels of oil a day.''</TEXT></DOC>
