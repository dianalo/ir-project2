An estimated 60,700 workers die on the job each year, theinstitute said.   While the U.S. Justice Department has had only two successfulprosecutions since 1980, California successfully prosecuted 112cases in that time under that state's operation of a federallyfunded safety program, the institute found. California has sincedropped its program, and supporters are seeking its reinstatement.   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten defended the federalsystem.   ``When we get a (criminal) case that has prosecutorial merit, weprosecute it,'' he said Friday.   ``It is often more appropriate to file and to prosecute suchcases in state court, where you have a wider variety of laws thatapply.''   Kinney said 50,000 of the estimated 60,700 workplace deaths eachyear were from disease, most often cancer.   ``But there are 10,000 traumatic deaths each year ... andanother 1.8 million injuries, and 60,000 or those result inpermanent disability,'' he added.   ``People think of these kinds of things as being part of our(labor) past,'' Kinney said, ``but this is our present.''   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration isempowered to seek criminal sanctions against employers in 28 stateswho violate workplace safety standards. That agency also is chargedwith monitoring programs in the remaining 22 states, which chooseto operate federally funded workplace-safety programs themselves.   California stopped administering its program in July 1987, whenRepublican Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed state funds used tosupplement the operation. Labor groups have filed lawsuits and putan initiative on the November ballot seeking reinstatement of theprogram.   The study noted that after OSHA cites an employer for safetyviolations, the case is reviewed by seven different offices beforethe Justice Department will bring it to trial.   ``Instead of trying to determine how justice can be done,they're trying to disqualify these cases. There isn't even onefull-time staff member assigned to these cases,'' Kinney said.   But OSHA spokesman Frank White said the agency's civil penaltiescan be effective. As an example, he pointed to a $4.2 million fineagainst Bath Iron Works in Maine for safety and health violations.   ``We think it's not the best use of our resources to chasecorporate outlaws,'' White said.   The study concluded that the federal government's reluctance tobring criminal prosecution has discouraged state and localprosecutors from pursuing safety violators.</TEXT></DOC>
