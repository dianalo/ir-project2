(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Lotus NotesandM;THIS REPORT IS not about Lotus Notes nor about groupware in general.andP;  Thisreport is about excitement--users' excitement at seeing a product that reallysolves basic day-to-day problems, developers' excitement at designing anapplication that users actually use, management's excitement at seeingcomputers addressing its major business priorities.andP;  It's about gettingcloser to the customer, flattening the organization, dealing with informationoverload, capturing internal knowledge and expertise, and overallresponsiveness and flexibility.andM;Lotus Notes is a tool that has this effect and then some.andP;  According toSheldon Laube, national director of information and technology for PriceWaterhouse, Notes has an almost visceral appeal to those with businessproblems.andP;  Suddenly, they see their own information needs being met, and theyquickly envision myriad specific applications to be implemented immediately.andO;Interestingly, these users tend not to be power computer users.andP;  In fact,they are not particularly impressed with the Notes technology, many of themhaving assumed that this is the way that computers have always acted in abusiness environment.andM;Karin Krueger, vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust, has witnessedthis excitement.andP;  Says Krueger, &quot;The reaction of business people when theysee demos--'Fantastic!andP;  Can I have it tomorrow?'&quot;andM;One result of Notes applications implementation has been to get new usersonline: According to Laube, 10 of the 15 partners that make up the PriceWaterhouse Management Committee were not regular PC users.andP;  Now these peopleall communicate amongst themselves via a Notes conferencing application.andM;Laube believes that one of the reasons for this is management's overwhelmingdesire for more &quot;soft&quot; information.andP;  Executives are willing to use Notesbecause it gives them qualitative information--the pulse of the business.andO;Executives tell Laube, &quot;I don't need to see more numbers; i need to knowwhat's behind the numbers.&quot;andM;Notes is also set apart from traditional applications by the user involvementin the application development cycle.andP;  The speed and flexibility of the toolallows frequent prototyping and customization for the particular user group.andO;For example, a client-tracking application at Manufacturers Hanover Trust hasevolved over the last 18 months.andP;  Users have maintained their involvement, soeach iteration has stayed in synch with user needs.andP;  Had this applicationbeen developed in the traditional MIS way, there would have been a lot ofup-front work on user requirements, but the ongoing relationship would nothave continued.andP;  The users might have been left with an application that was18 months out of date and very difficult to change.andM;The interactive development process adds to the users' relationship with theapplication.andP;  Once the applications are in place, and, in fact, during theapplication development process, user buy-in to the application is very high.andO;There seems to be less resistance to adopting the application or doing theextra work required to get it up and running.andP;  Price Waterhouse's George Johnalso notes that users &quot;take ownership&quot; of applications very quickly, allowingdevelopers to go on to other things.andM;In this report, we will examine why Notes is creating this excitement.andP;  Wewill look at the types of applications for which Notes is best suited andwill discuss some specific application examples developed by early Notesusers.andM;This is not, however, an unqualified endorsement of Notes.andP;  Notes is far fromperfect.andP;  It is weak in a number of areas, including connectivity to outsideapplications and data sources, integration between different Notes-basedapplications, lack of Macintosh support, and overall performance,particularly in a Windows (i.e., non-OS/2) environment.andP;  And, in fact, one ofthe early beta sites (see box on page 7, &quot;Corporate Software's SoftwareEvaluation&quot;) is still not certain whether the product is ready for furtherdevelopment.andP;  On the other hand, the fact that it shows the potential of aproduct of its type makes us more tolerant of its flaws.andM;Notes as a Development PlatformandM;Lotus defines Notes as a group communications product that allows people tocreate and access document-oriented information on PC LANs.andP;  We see it asmore of an applications development tool with a unique (at least for PC LANs)combination of characteristics--document database, store-and-forward mail,and also conferencing capabilities.andP;  It is also the first of the newgeneration of workgroup products that makes use of a client/serverarchitecture on PC LANs.andM;The key to the eventual success of the product is the tailorability of theapplications to solve specific work problems.andP;  The out-of-the-boxcommunications features--electronic mail and group conferencing--are, inthemselves, interesting, but they pale before the real power of Notes as aplatform for developing specific applications that deal with the informationissues facing a company or a group within a company.andM;NOTES PHILOSOPHY.andP;  In order to understand how Notes can best be used as adevelopment platform, it is important to keep in mind the philosophy behindthe product.andP;  According to Eric Sall, director of applications marketing forNotes, the product's goal is to transform the way people work, particularlyas it relates to how people deal with group or corporate information.andP;  Sallcautions that, for a Notes application to be successful, it must firstsupport the way people work today, enhancing communication and ease of accessto shared data.andP;  Eventually, this leads to a qualitative jump to new ways ofworking together.andM;This, says Sall, should occur in two stages.andP;  The first is the use of Notesto make more efficient what is generally done on paper today.andP;  As usersbecome more familiar with the capabilities of Notes, they will begin to moveto the second stage: the use of Notes to do more than just mirror paper, andto actually transform the way in which information flows in a company.andM;The Notes philosophy has two specific tenets: supporting the way peopleinteract, and making groups work together more effectively.andM;According to the Notes philosophy, people interact in two ways.andP;  They sendthings back and forth to each other (e.g., via electronic mail), and they alllook at the same information--generally, structured information in databasesand unstructured discussions in bulletin boards and conferences.andM;Notes attempts to enhance a group's ability to look at both unstructured andsemistructured data, including data that generally resides only in one ormore individuals' heads.andM;Notes allows groups to work more effectively by providing a tool to createbusiness applications that capture and allow access to much of thisinformation.andP;  And this tool is flexible enough to customize applications sothat they are keyed to the corporation's, department's, or group's needs andgoals.andM;The philosophy also has two specific sub-themes.andP;  First, the tool itself(Notes) should not force a particular structure on the application or onthose using it.andP;  This can be contrasted to an early groupware product, TheCoordinator, from Action Technologies.andP;  The Coordinator tried to implement aparticular view of how business interaction should take place within thestructure of the application.andP;  According to Sall, Notes tends to structureinformation rather than interaction, though he contends that, as anapplication development tool, Notes is flexible enough to implement even themost inflexible application.andM;The second sub-theme is that the tool should be totally accessible to endusers.andP;  This occurs on two levels.andP;  First, Notes has been designed so thatapplications can be built within the user departments.andP;  This generally takesless programming knowledge than it does design skill and an understanding ofthe business problem and the way people interact.andP;  Building applicationsshould require ability levels similar to developing a spreadsheet (keeping inmind that there are varying degrees of sophistication among spreadsheetdevelopers).andM;Second, Notes takes end-user programming to an additional level by allowingusers to customize their access to the information by creating Private Views.andM;Complementary Products.andP;  A number of areas of group interaction, most notablyreal-time conferencing, do not fit into the Notes philosophy.andP;  Lotus seesthese as complementary areas for which other developers will be developingapplications.andP;  These areas include process-oriented applications such asactivity coordination, workflow automation, and virtual meetings, includingdesktop videoconferencing.andP;  (The Notes team is very interested in certainareas of multimedia.andP;  Voice annotation seems to fit right into the Notesphilosophy.)andM;We feel that this somewhat arbitrary separation, while making certain Notesapplications conceptually easier to understand, limits the product in termsof process support and interactivity.andP;  Applications such as client-trackingshould have the ability to be more proactive: for example, sending an alarmwhen a proposal is due or when a salesperson has not called on a particularcustomer in 30 days.andP;  Lotus's separation of Notes from workflow automationproducts would require two application development platforms for this type ofapplication.andP;  In addition, this separation would force the user to decidewhich application to call his or her home application--a user following salesleads may find this decision untenable.andM;Notes vs.andP;  Relational Database.andP;  Notes is not a relational database managerand is not meant to be the development platform for those applicationsrequiring relational database capabilities.andP;  Notes is basically aimed atthose applications that have a predominance of unstructured or semistructureddata and in which information tends to be added rather than updated.andP;  Forexample, Notes is unable to assure that revised data will not overwrite otherrevised data during the replication process.andM;There are, however, many gray areas where either or both types of tools(Notes or RDBMS) could be used to develop an application.andP;  An example of thisis a Notes-based equipment-tracking application.andP;  In what seems like atypical database application, a company needs to keep track of what computerequipment is on which desk and how it is being used and maintained.andP;  Thecompany found that Notes was a good vehicle for this application because itcould hold both the structured information--the office number, the user, themachine serial number, network card type, etc.--and the unstructured--user'sperceptions of how the machine was behaving, what was done to solve the lastproblem, etc.andP;  This could have been done with an RDBMS, certainly.andP;  But theemphasis of the application would probably have been different, with thequantitative information more readily available than the qualitative.andM;NOTES APPLICATIONS.andP;  Given this philosophy, what types of applications aremost appropriately developed on Notes?andP;  Lotus provides the followingguidelines:andM;* Need for better communication and better information accessandM;* Text- and graphics-oriented documentsandM;* Mixture of structured and unstructured documentsandM;* Dynamic addition of informationandM;* Sharing across groups or locationsandM;* Access of the entire group to the LANandM;* Benefit of communication is worth the effortandM;Applications that are specifically inappropriate for Notes developmentinclude:andM;* Database transaction-locking applicationsandM;* Complicated number-crunchingandM;* Very tight data-updating timeframesandM;* Online &quot;custom&quot; queryingandM;Notes applications can best be categorized along two axes: interactivity andstructure (see Illustration 1).andP;  Along the interaction axis, threeapplication categories emerge:andM;* Publishing--making availability of certain information widespreadandM;* Routing--sending information to a certain destination or along a certainpathandM;* Interacting--group creation, sharing, and dissemination of informationandM;Application Examples.andP;  As we can see in Illustration 1, specific applicationtypes fit into each category.andP;  Some of the most interesting, the ones usingthe most interaction and structure, are tracking applications.andP;  Theseapplications address the immediate problem of capturing information that canthen be used by others involved in the process.andM;Let's look specifically at an example that is used internally at Lotus.andP;  Inits Prospect Tracking database, Lotus field personnel enter pertinentinformation about new prospects (see Illustration 2).andP;  As the status of theprospect changes, i.e., from prospect to customer, it is reflected in theNotes database.andP;  Someone looking at this database can view it by Status(seeing who is hot, who is already a customer, etc.), by Industry, by Region,by Company Size, how initial contact was made, by whom, and so on.andP;  Each ofthese views may be useful for different people.andM;For example, a national account manager who is dealing with a company withmultiple location can coordinate the activities of different sales reps inthe different geographical areas.andP;  The sales reps can also see how those inother areas are approaching this account.andP;  Or regional managers can see thattheir regions are completing deals at a higher or lower rate compared toothers.andP;  Or the person who made the original contact can see if the prospectwas actually landed--information that is not usually available to fieldpeople.andM;The fact that this application has a lot of structure does not in any waylimit the unstructured information that can be maintained.andP;  Information suchas the contacter's impressions of how the initial contact went, or otherthoughts such as the best way to further approach the customer (specific hotbuttons, etc.) can be put into an unstructured comments field and be easilyreviewed by the salesperson assigned to the account.andP;  That salesperson canadd further comments so that a complete picture of the customer is formed.andM;The usefulness of this application goes even further.andP;  For example, one ofthe fields in this application indicates what Network_Type the prospect hasinstalled.andP;  This is particularly important for Lotus, since Notes does notcurrently run, for example, on Banyan VINES.andP;  This information can then beused to &quot;backburner&quot; those prospects in favor of concentrating on moreimmediate possibilities.andP;  As soon as Notes can be run on VINES, the Lotussalespeople can immediately know whom to contact.andP;  Similarly, theLotus/Novell agreement, had it lasted, might have provided a specificmarketing opportunity to Novell users.andP;  Again, this information would havebeen instantly available to the sales force.andM;Other tracking applications include software bugs tracking, equipment history(see &quot;Notes vs.andP;  Relational Database,&quot; above), and customer contact (see thebox, &quot;Manufacturers Hanover Trust Tracks Clients&quot;).andM;Less structured applications includce discussions modeled on the groupconferencing paradigm.andP;  A typical example would be a &quot;Hot Topics&quot; databasethat allows very free interaction among group members.andP;  Such an applicationhas little structure--Subject, Response, Author, Date.andP;  But even this limitedstructure can turn out to be very powerful.andP;  In addition to viewing thedatabase by Topic, Author, or Date (chronological), the database itself coulddefine any topic over one month old as &quot;cold&quot; and remove it from the display.andO;Commonly, this topic would continue to appear in another database in thesystem that was not designated as &quot;hot.&quot;andM;One area of specific interest is electronic mail.andP;  Notes offers a Mailapplication (essentially, another Notes database) which has some structure,such as a subject field.andP;  However, using Notes, a much more structured mailapplication could be built which does more filtering and categorizing ofincoming messages.andP;  For example, a specific message form, a Meeting Request,could be created, which would contain all of the appropriate fields forscheduling a meeting--date, time, attendees, etc.andP;  The person receiving mailcould view all of the Meeting Requests together.andM;This is not as advanced as some of the more powerful mail filtering systemsjust being introduced, which allow specific actions to be taken based on thecontent of the incoming mail.andM;Other application types include: reference applications, such as legislativetracking by the Price Waterhouse Employee Benefits Services Group (see box,p. 10); forms-based applications, such as Corporate Software's SoftwareEvaluation application (see box, p. 7); and news filtering currently providedby Reuters (see box p. 12).andM;Notes: The ProductandM;Notes is a client/server-based application, supporting PCs running MS Windowsor OS/2 as front ends to an OS/2 server back end.andP;  Notes currently runs on3Com 3+ and 3+Open, IBM PC LAN, and Novell NetWare 286 and 386.andP;  A consistentinterface is maintained on the PC through Windows and Presentation Manager.andM;The server functions as a repository and management point for the documentdatabases (or applications).andP;  In addition, it controls the communicationsfunctions, such as database replication and mail routing.andM;Notes comes with a set of predefined databases, or applications, includingelectronic mail and conferencing.andP;  A set of templates and sample applicationshelps the users and/or developers get going with their own self-developedapplications.andM;DATABASES OF DOCUMENTS.andP;  Notes applications are best characterized asdatabases of documents, where each document can have both structured andunstructured fields.andP;  The user (and the developer, for that matter) never seethe database itself, other than as an icon on the desktop.andP;  All databaseaccess is through Forms and Views.andP;  It is the customizability by the user ofthese Forms and Views that gives Notes its power as an applicationdevelopment tool.andM;Forms and Views.andP;  The two key constructs of a Notes application are its Formsand Views.andP;  The forms are both the method of entering information into thedatabase and of presenting the information to the reader.andP;  They consist offields that are filled in on entry (some of these can be defaulted--i.e.,andO;author, time; some of these can be required--i.e., subject, due date forfollow-up action).andP;  The fields can be of several types, including calculatedfields, data fields, numeric fields, and rich-text fields that have a fullset of rich-text features--fonts, styles, colors, images, graphics.andO;Rich-text fields, however, are limited to 64K.andM;The application developer can restrict the user's choice of what can go in afield to a limited set of values.andP;  These values can be displayed for the userto choose from.andM;Generic forms include documents, responses, and responses to responses.andP;  Thisset enables any application to have conferencing features, where a reader canadd comments to the document.andP;  Notes users can follow such a discussion bysubject, author, dates, or any other structured field that the developer putsinto the application.andM;Forms can also be tailored for the specific application.andP;  The electronic mailapplication described above could have a general message form, a meetingrequest form, a telephone message form, a meeting report form, etc., each tobe used in the appropriate fashion.andM;Access to the information is presented to the user through Views.andP;  Generally,a main view sorts the documents (forms) by the most appropriate field--i.e.,andO;date, author, or form type.andP;  Other views, for example, may sort by additionalfields--i.e., subject, next action, or customer status.andM;These views are created by the application's developer, and new views can beeasily added.andP;  There is also a very powerful facility called Private Views,which allows users to create personal views that appear only on their ownViews menu.andP;  The drawback is that creating new views, though not difficult,is not a trivial task for someone who does it infrequently.andP;  The timerepaired for creation has to be weighed against the additional benefit of thenew view.andP;  Private views are not really suitable as ad hoc query devices--afacility which users would like to see added to Notes.andM;Policy Statement.andP;  One of the more interesting features of Notes is thepolicy statement that accompanies every database.andP;  The first time a databaseis added to the desktop, the policy statement automatically displays.andO;Typically, it instructs the user in the proper use of the application andprovides a contact name in case of problems or questions.andP;  The policystatement is also available to the user at any time.andM;Navigation.andP;  Besides the public and private views, Notes has a full-textsearch capability.andP;  In addition, documents can be hot-linked to each other,giving Notes some simple hypertext capabilities.andP;  Hot links can be made todocuments within the same database, between two databases, or between adatabase and a mail message.andP;  For example, a user sending a mail messageabout a recent trip could link the mail message to the specific report in atrip reports database.andM;Filters.andP;  Another powerful Notes feature is filters.andP;  Filters have two majoruses.andP;  The first is to automatically categorize incoming mail or newly posteddocuments.andP;  For example, a user can run a filter against all unread mailwhich categorizes as urgent all messages from the company president.andP;  Thiscapability is, however, not as powerful as the mail-filtering products we arebeginning to see coming out of the LENS project at MIT or from startups suchas Agility Systems and Beyond Inc. LENS-type products will allow thesystem--or an agent--to take specific actions based on the content orstructure of the incoming message.andP;  They will also permit an agent to go outto a central mail processing point and look for messages on topics that mightbe of interest to the user.andM;The second use of filters is to allow retroactive changes to be made toexisting databases.andP;  Filters can be used to add fields, delete fields, orchange the values in fields in all or a select group of documents in adatabase.andP;  To understand the power and flexibility this adds, let's look at ahypothetical example using the Lotus Prospect Tracking database discussedabove.andM;Assume that there is no specific Network_Type field in the application, butthat the network type generally was put into an unstructured text field.andP;  Byusing a combination of full-text search and filters, the Network_Type fieldcan be retroactively created.andP;  The procedure goes something like this:andM;* A full-text database search is done on the word &quot;Novell.&quot;andM;* All documents containing &quot;Novell&quot; are selected.andM;* A filter is run on all selected documents which adds a Network_Type fieldand fills its value with &quot;Novell.&quot;andM;* The procedure is repeated for &quot;3Com,&quot; etc.andM;* Finally, a filter is run against all documents that have not been selectedpreviously, adding the field and filling it in with &quot;unknown&quot; or &quot;other.&quot;andM;ACCESSING EXTERNAL DATA.andP;  Accessing external data, whether from otherdatabase sources or between Notes databases, is a major concern for Notesusers.andP;  Currently, Notes deals with external data via import and exportfunctions (see Illustration 3).andP;  In the future, Lotus plans to publish theNotes API so that developers can get information directly from a Notesdatabase into their applications and vice versa.andM;SECURITY.andP;  Notes provides two levels of security--one to the entering Notesitself, and the other to each database.andP;  Loading Notes requires anon-password-based key file to be resident either on the PC hard drive or ona floppy disk that can be carried around.andP;  While this avoids the typicalpassword problems--users giving them out, not changing them, or forgettingthem, or someone breaking into the password database--it seems somewhatarchaic and cumbersome to us.andM;To control access to the databases themselves, Notes provides a full set ofaccess attributes for each database, including:andM;* Manager--can change access and privileges.andM;* Designer--can alter database design.andM;* Editor--can edit documents.andM;* Author--can add and read documents.andM;* Reader--can read documents.andM;* Depositor--can add documents without reading others.andM;* No Access--can read policy statement only.andM;Rrivilege levels can be assigned to individuals and groups.andM;ROUTING AND REPLICATION.andP;  Notes supports two types of communicationsarchitectures, routing and replication.andP;  The Notes server is the routingpoint for electronic mail exchange.andP;  The server also can replicate orexchange updates to databases with other Notes servers or Notes clients indifferent locations.andP;  The replication process allows any documents added toeither database location since the last replication to be added to the other.andO;This allows multiple locations to work with the same database, and allowspeople working on different LANs (e.g., Novell and 3Com) to work with thesame Notes application.andM;While replication is useful for information that is added to the database, itcan be a problem when existing information is altered.andP;  If a document hasbeen altered at two locations before replication, one of the sets of changeswill be lost.andM;Replication is essential for implementing Lotus's view (which we stronglyshare) that workgroups are becoming more geographically dispersed and that aspecific workgroup may exist for only a short period of time.andP;  Replicationhelps Notes applications transcend the geographical, temporal, technical, andorganizational barriers to these groups working as groups.andM;FUTURE DIRECTIONS.andP;  Having worked over the last year to get the releaseversion of Notes out, Lotus is now looking to provide a set of enhancements.andO;The initial priorities include enhancing communications and connectivity,delivering the Notes API, enhancing remote communications, and eliminatingthe 64K limit on rich-text fields.andM;Enhance Communications And Connectivity.andP;  There are three areas ofcommunications that Lotus will address first:andM;* Support for additional LANs.andP;  Lotus plans to extend Notes to additionalLANs, with the first focus on Banyan VINES.andP;  This should not be a difficultchallenge, given Banyan's recent announcement supporting OS/2 applicationsservers and LAN Manager products on VINES servers.andM;* Wide area communications.andP;  Lotus has recently announced a joint partnershipwith NYNEX to integrate the proposed Switched Multimegabit Data Services(SMDS) with Notes.andP;  This would allow Notes to take advantage of the up to 45Mbps bandwidth to quickly replicate databases and deliver documents that arerich in text, graphics, and images.andM;* Mail gateways.andP;  Lotus has an internal VAX gateway for Notes and iscurrently evaluating whether to market it.andP;  An MHS gateway is currently inbeta.andP;  Lotus has recently announced that it is developing an X.400 gatewaywith Touch Communications and is working with Soft Swith on other LAN Mailsystems.andP;  In addition, Lotus is looking at a method for providing direct faxaccess from Notes.andM;The API Toolkit.andP;  Lotus plans to deliver the API toolkit as soon as possible,though Notes developers would like it even sooner than that.andP;  Once available,the API will provide access for other applications to the Notes databases,provide a direct way to move data in and out of databases, and provideapplications with access to the mail system.andM;Improved Remote Access.andP;  The initial work in improving remote access will beto enhance workstation-based replication and support compression onhigh-speed modems.andM;The 64KB Limit.andP;  Lotus has committed to eliminating the 64KB limit on richtext fields, which has effectively restricted the use of image and graphicswithin a document.andM;Not Right Away.andP;  The first wave of Notes enhancements will not completelyanswer the users' needs.andP;  Two areas that still must be addressed are queriesor views across Notes databases and supporting Macintosh clients within theapplication.andP;  Lotus recognizes that both of these are very important to thelong-term viability of Notes.andP;  However, Lotus also realizes that these arenot trivial updates at all, and, therefore, these updates will not becomeavailable very soon.andM;We also think it is important to enhance the Notes connectivity to otherconferencing systems, particularly VAXnotes.andP;  Lotus is less certain about theneed for this and has no current plans to develop these links.andM;Notes Market FocusandM;With Notes, Lotus has moved out of its traditional retail channel to a directsales approach.andP;  This has been done for three specific reasons:andM;* Economic.andP;  Traditional resellers are not prepared for the high supportrequirements and long sales cycle of this type of product.andP;  This is an issuefacing all ISVs writing distributed applications for PC LANs.andP;  Theannouncement of the proposed Lotus/Novell merger emphasized the necessity offinding a company or channel with both the applications and networkingexpertise.andM;* Positioning.andP;  Lotus is positioning Notes as a communication vehicle, partof an information infrastructure.andP;  The product thus needs to be sold at ahigh level (even though many applications will be implemented at thedepartment level) and is more analogous to mainframe or mini software.andM;* Public Relations.andP;  At the infancy of this type of product, Lotus cannotafford to have people &quot;do it wrong.&quot;andP;  The Notes team has worked very closelywith developers at its initial customer sites in order to assure successfulimplementations.andM;LARGE COMPANIES ONLY.andP;  These three reasons have led Lotus to market Notes tolarge companies, with the minimum license having been set at 200 users (at aprice of $62,500, with additional licenses at $295 per machine).andP;  The initialorder is bundled with on-site installation and training and with applicationdesign to total five days of a systems engineer's time, as well as six monthsof maintenance, including all upgrades, hot-line telephone support, and 10sets of documentation.andM;In the long run, Lotus hopes to be able to deliver Notes to smallercompanies, but it sees two issues that must be addressed before this becomesfeasible.andP;  First is bringing the reseller channels to the point where theycan understand and support the complexities of both distributed applicationsand the network infrastructures necessary to implement them.andM;Second, Lotus sees Notes as more than a workgroup tool, but as the basis forinformation exchange throughout an organization.andP;  Thus, the ultimate issue isnot the number of users and how to support them, but where Notes fits in theorganization and from how high up on the ladder comes the support forNotes-based development.andP;  It is likely that the next wave of Notesapplications will be company-wide in smaller organizations rather than inspecific departments in large companies.andM;SUPPORT PARTNERS.andP;  While not setting up a reseller channel, Lotus hasactively been pursuing third parties, mainly systems integrators, to providecomplementary products and additional services to Notes users.andP;  This program,called the Alliance Partner Program, will qualify and assist third parties inproviding a variety of consulting-type services, including network set-up andsupport, systems integration, and application development.andP;  Lotus emphasizesthat these partners will not be authorized to sell Notes.andM;Lotus is also working with application developers to provide Notes add-insand complementary products, as well as to integrate their vertical productsinto Notes.andM;Notes In Lotus's PlansandM;The relationship of Notes to Lotus's other offerings has been a source ofconfusion to some Notes users.andP;  While Notes is on the cutting edge ofworkgroup computing and the client/server architecture, it seems somewhatbehind other Lotus products in other areas such as database access,internationalization, and multiple platform support.andP;  Users attending therecent Lotus Week presentations found Lotus's overall directions,particularly related to transparent data access and multiplatform strategy,were not being reflected in Notes.andM;A conversation with Frank King, the company's senior vice president, helpedclarify the Lotus approach to integrating newer technologies, such as Notes,into its mainstream product strategy.andP;  According to King, Lotus has twodifferent models for developing applications.andP;  The coreapplications--essentially, the spreadsheets and graphics products--aremaintained with a rigorous update schedule.andP;  In addition, these products arecommitted to the Lotus core strategy, which include DataLens (for informationaccess) and LEAF (for developing add-in products) support,internationalization, and multiple platforms.andM;Notes, on the other hand, falls into the new-development category, which hasproduced, in addition to Magellean and Agenda, numerous &quot;products&quot; that willnever come to market.andP;  King notes that this type of product needs to developat its own pace, and thus, at Lotus, is more loosely managed.andM;King predicts that, at some point, Notes will become a core product and willthen have to meet the core strategy, including DataLens, multiplatform, andinternationalization.andP;  But until the product matures some more, Lotus intendsto keep it free and unfettered, sacrificing some confusion for overallgrowth.andM;ConclusionandM;Notes is a product whose strengths (flexibility, ease of use, and rapidapplication development) and weaknesses (lack of integration with other datasources and no Mac client) are secondary to the example it gives us of howapplications will be developed and delivered in the '90s.andM;To be successful, applications will have to leverage the new generation oftechnologies, particularly the client/server model, and will have to do morethan just deal with individual productivity.andP;  These applications will bedesigned to increase the effectiveness of groups and the corporation as awhole.andP;  Particularly important will be groupware applications, which captureand make persistent a group's knowledge, expertise, and history.andP;  And weexpect that these applications will bring in a whole new set of users forwhom the current individual productivity offerings are not strategic enoughto overcome the hurdles to learning the applications.andP;  (Of course, the issueswhich enable lowering these hurdles must also be addressed.)andM;Most importantly, the successful applications will directly address thebusiness problems and corporate hot buttons that are specific to eachcompany, generating the same kind of excitement that we have seen among thepioneer Notes users.andM;Within this context, Notes is a work-in-progress, a status that allows us tooverlook many of its faults because of the promise it shows.andP;  At the sametime, it allows us to feel some of the same excitement that users arefeeling.andP;  What if we could publish some of our analyses as Notes databases,thus enabling easy access for our readers to the information and closeinteraction between us and our readers and among the readers themselves?andP;  Nowthat could be exciting!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
