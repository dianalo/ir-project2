Led by the Reagan administration and the oil industry, theadvocates won another round against environmental groups onWednesday as legislation to allow oil rigs into the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge was endorsed by the first House panel to vote onthe issue.   The bill was approved 17-9 by the Merchant Marine subcommitteeon fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment, settingthe stage for expected approval next week by the full committee.   Earlier this year, the Senate Energy and Natural ResourcesCommittee voted 11-8 for legislation to allow development of thepotentially extensive oil deposits in the coastal plain of the 19million-acre reserve in Alaska. The bill is awaiting floor debate.   The issue has provoked a major struggle in the 100th Congressbetween environmentalists, who want no drilling in the refuge, andthose who say the refuge offers the best chance to counter agrowing national dependence on imported petroleum.   An Interior Department study says development can be carried outin an environmentally sound manner and could produce oil to rivalthe Prudhoe Bay complex about 70 miles to the west. Prudhoe Bayaccounts for about 20 percent of U.S. production.   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, one of the major House champions ofdrilling in the refuge, said Wednesday that time is growing short.   Young quoted House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, as saying thatbecause of a crowded calendar and time off for politicalconventions and reelection campaigns, a drilling bill needs to getto the House floor by mid-June to ensure approval by Congress thisyear.   The House Interior Committee also has jurisdiction over theissue. Its chairman, Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., is sponsoringlegislation to declare the refuge permanently off-limits topetroleum development.   The Interior water and power resources subcommittee is notplanning to hold hearings on refuge legislation until early June.In the past, the Interior Committee has been more sympathetic toenvironmentalist positions than many other House panels.   The Merchant Marine subcommittee approved a plan drafted by Rep.Walter Jones, D-N.C., to allow phased oil leasing over a decade butbar development in a 260,000-acre are used for calving by amigratory caribou herd.   Drilling in the refuge would be exempt from the RefugeAdministration Act of 1966's requirement that development becompatible with a refuge's basic purpose of preserving wildlifehabitat.   That law requires developers to prove compatibility, a difficulttask. Jones' bill, however, would force opponents of developing thecoastal plain to prove that such activity would have significantand adverse long-term effects on habitat, also seen by subcommitteelawyers as a difficult task.   The bill would prohibit export of any petroleum extracted fromthe 1.5 million acre coastal plain and would require any oceantransport of this oil to be done on ships registered in the UnitedStates.   The legislation also would create a new 23.5 million-acreTeshekpuk-Utukok National Wildlife Refuge to the west of PrudhoeBay and place a five-year moratorium on any petroleum leasing inthe new refuge.   Drilling foes repeatedly failed in attempts to amend the bill.Rejected proposals included variations on the theme of putting offa decision on the coastal plain until completion of a nationalenergy policy study emphasizing conservation and renewables.</TEXT></DOC>
