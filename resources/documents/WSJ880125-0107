The Army's move, which must be reviewed by the office of Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, would drive up costs for the Marines. The Marine Corps is expected to press the secretary to force the Army to reconsider.    The V-22, or Osprey, is a tilt-rotor aircraft developed by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., a unit of Textron Inc., and Boeing Vertol Co., a unit of Boeing Co. The Marines consider the aircraft vital to mounting amphibious assaults and other surprise operations. However, if the Army's decision sticks, the Marines also may have to reconsider.    Navy Secretary James Webb has already raised concern over the cost of the Osprey, which he estimates at $26 million for each aircraft. &quot;When you run up unit prices so high that you can't buy many of them, you affect your ability to sustain yourself,&quot; Secretary Webb said in an interview last week.    The Army's decision comes on the heels of a similar budget-cutting plan to drop the ambitious LHX helicopter program and proceed only with a new lightweight scout and attack helicopter. </TEXT></DOC>
