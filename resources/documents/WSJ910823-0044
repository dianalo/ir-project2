The blasts and fires, which injured 130 other people, wereamong America's biggest postwar industrial accidents. Theyhelped spur Labor Department efforts for increasedenforcement and monitoring of safety practices in thepetrochemical industry, which, along with oil facilities, hasbeen beset by explosions and fires in recent years. Thedepartment's Occupational Safety and Health Administrationhad been criticized for lax regulation of the industry.</LP><TEXT>   The Phillips fine would top the agency's previous record,set in January of this year when Arco Chemical Co. agreed topay $3.5 million to settle charges of workplace violations atits plant in Channelview, Texas. A July 1990 explosion atthat plant killed 17 workers. Arco Chemical is 83%-owned byAtlantic Richfield Co.   Under the agreement with OSHA, in which Phillips didn'tadmit wrongdoing, the company said it will applymore-rigorous safety procedures throughout the corporation.This will allow such measures to be put into effect rightaway, rather than &quot;causing delays through prolongedlitigation,&quot; said OSHA Administrator Gerard Scannell. OSHAlast year proposed a $5.7 million fine, saying it foundinternal company documents calling for &quot;corrective action&quot; onsafety problems, &quot;but which were largely ignored.&quot;   Phillips agreed to extend the enhanced safety methodsbeyond the plant in Pasadena, Texas, which was rocked by the1989 explosions, to plants in Sweeny and Borger, also inTexas, and its facility in Woods Cross, Utah, OSHA said.   Phillips President B.M. Thompson, in a statement, said,&quot;We felt it was best to try and reach a settlement to allowboth parties to avoid potentially long and costlylitigation.&quot; He added that the settlement is consistent withthe company's safety programs.   When OSHA cited Phillips, it said there was no backupprotection such as a double valve to protect against valvefailure or an untimely valve opening, violating both thecompany's own procedures and standard industry practice. OSHAalso charged Phillips with failure to prevent theuncontrolled release of flammable vapors or to provideadequate fire protection, and said employees weren't familiarwith the plant alarm system or respiratory protection.   Under the agreement, the Bartlesville, Okla.-based companywill also improve worker training in safety procedures, tohelp ensure that workers -- including contract employees --are well informed about potential hazards and can handleproblems before they become emergencies, Mr. Scannell said.   OSHA has begun focusing more on chemical companies' use ofcontract workers, following criticism that its surveillanceof such workers is less rigorous than for companies' ownemployees. In a recent study commissioned by OSHA, the JohnGray Institute in Beaumont, Texas, said OSHA should requirethe petrochemical industry to assume responsibility fortraining and overseeing safety practices of contract workers.   The institute said chemical plants are using such workersmore and training them less, though they do some of the &quot;morerisky and hazardous work.&quot; OSHA's proposed penalties of$730,000 against Phillips' contractor, Fish Engineering andamp;Construction Inc., for violations connected with the 1989explosions are pending. Fish Engineering, which is based inHouston, couldn't immediately be reached for comment.   OSHA has also launched more thorough inspections of largepetrochemical plants. Last year it proposed requiringchemical-plant managers to adopt rigorous safety programs,including a more systematic approach for identifying andcontrolling production processes that involve highlyhazardous chemicals.   Phillips shares were quoted at $25.375, down 12.5 cents,in late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.   ---   REPUBLIC NATIONAL BANK faces loss of $13 million ingold-coin fraud.   Tzyy Bin Chen, a New York businessman, was charged withbank fraud in connection with the scheme. Prosecutors chargedthat Mr. Chen obtained $13.4 million in loans from RepublicNational Bank of New York by putting up fake gold-bullioncoins as collateral.   Mr. Chen, who denied the charges in federal court inManhattan, was released after posting a $3 million bond.   A spokesman for Republic said that the bank's totalpossible loss on the loans to Mr. Chen is $13 million, whichhe said would be covered by the bank's $233 million loan lossreserve. &quot;We were victimized by a fraudulent scheme, which wediscovered and immediately brought to the attention ofauthorities,&quot; the spokesman said. Efforts are under way torecover the money that was loaned to Mr. Chen, he added.   The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan said the RepublicNew York Corp. unit began making the loans to Mr. Chen inearly 1988. The first deposits of the coins as collateralwere found to be authentic by a Republic bank official inEncino, Calif., and the bank agreed to provide loans of about80% of the value of the coins.   Later Mr. Chen arranged for the coins to be deposited atRepublic's office in New York. By August 1991, the totalsupposed value of the coins was $17.8 million, prosecutorssaid in the complaint against Mr. Chen.   According to the complaint, Republic became concernedabout the large quantity of the coins in July 1991 and hadits coin expert in California examine them. The bank officialdetermined that the coins on deposit were either altered orcounterfeit, valued at only a small fraction of authenticgold-bullion coins.   Prosecutors also said that the authentic gold coinsinitially deposited with Republic had been replaced withfakes.   Mr. Chen's attorney couldn't be reached for comment.   ---   LATHAM andamp; WATKINS LAYS OFF 43 associates, citingrecessionary pressures.   A partner at the Los Angeles-based law firm, ErnestSchmider, said the cutback was the first it has ever made foreconomic reasons.   Managing partner John F. Walker Jr. said the move was a&quot;long-term adjustment&quot; to new market conditions and changingattitudes on the part of the firm's clients. &quot;Clients thesedays are less willing to use younger, untrained lawyers,&quot; hesaid.   During the 1980s, Latham andamp; Watkins grew to becomeCalifornia's third-largest law firm, with one of the nation'shigh-profile practices. But as the legal market tightened,Latham's profit per partner declined, as was the case at manyother large law firms.   In 1990, profits per partner at the firm sank 14% to$575,000, down from the previous year's $670,000, said Mr.Schmider. He said the cutbacks weren't aimed at raising thisyear's profits per partner, however.   &quot;We have a strong ethic of treating our associates fairly,and we think we owe it to them in this instance to say thatthe number and timing of these terminations is part of ourstrategic response to changes in the markets in which wecompete,&quot; Mr. Schmider said.   Before the layoffs, Latham employed 650 lawyers. Mr.Schmider said no other cutbacks are expected.   ---   SUIT SEEKING DISMISSAL of judge in massive asbestos caseis rejected.   Filed by the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservativepublic interest law group, the suit sought to disqualify afederal judge in Philadelphia from hearing a class-actionsuit filed on behalf of 35,000 public and private schoolsnationwide against several asbestos manufacturers by accusinghim of ethical misconduct.   U.S. District Judge James Kelly had previously turned downa request by 12 former asbestos manufacturers sued in thecase, including Pfizer Inc., GAF Corp., and W.R. Grace andamp; Co.,that he step aside because of suspected bias. The judge hadattended a June 1990 conference on asbestos disease that waspartly paid for by the plaintiffs' lawyers.   The judge did rule, however, that no testimony from any ofthe expert witnesses who appeared at the conference would beallowed, thus attempting to eliminate any appearance of bias.   The foundation, which isn't a party to the case, thenfiled a suit with a federal judicial disciplinary panel inPhiladelphia alleging that Judge Kelly's attendance at theconference was grounds for forcing him off the case.   In a tersely worded opinion yesterday, Chief U.S. DistrictJudge Dolores Sloviter in Philadelphia rejected the requestand criticized the foundation for pressing judicialmisconduct charges. The proper remedy, she said, would be forthe parties in the case to appeal Judge Kelly's decision.   The foundation alleged that Judge Kelly improperly allowedhis seminar fees and hotel expenses to be paid for by theconference sponsors, then disclosed the gifts in the wrongsection of his 1990 financial disclosure statement. JudgeSloviter called the financial disclosure issue &quot;patentlyinsufficient&quot; and &quot;frivolous,&quot; adding that the judge haderred only by filling out the statement incorrectly.   The Washington Legal Foundation said it planned to appealJudge Sloviter's decision to the full disciplinary panellater this month.</TEXT></DOC>
