He shows the relationship the emissionsof dioxin and other products of incomplete combustion have with designand operation of baghouses, dry scrubbers, and furnaces. Newer mass-burnmunicipal solid waste incinerators emit pollutants at a lower rate thanold-style mass-burn facilities. Meanwhile, retrofitting of new technologiesand application of new, improved techniques to older incinerators isshowing promising results. Other results reported are that reductionsin dioxin and organic emission can be achieved by a properly operatedscrubber and baghouse, and plants with efficient particulate and acidgas control devices can reduce mercury emissions by as much as 99%. Therelative impact of refuse-to-energy plants on human health and the environmentshould soon become insignificant in comparison with other pollution sourcesin the environment.</TEXT></DOC>
