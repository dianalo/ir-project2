The report by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency found thatthe impact of a scaled-back defense budget will affect individualcompanies and some communities, but nationwide the impact will beminimal.   ``We estimate that even if defense spending were reduced at anannual rate of 2 percent for as long as five years, job loss wouldbe roughly 68,000 defense-related workers per year,'' according tothe study by the government agency.   The agency found that programs in place through the Job TrainingPartnership Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining NotificationAct, as well as assistance provided by the Defense Department'sOffice of Economic Adjustment, are enough to help defense workerswho lose their jobs.   Some members of Congress have pushed for additional programs toassist employees and communities affected by lower defensespending. The House-passed defense bills include $200 million forexisting programs and provides funds to affected communities.   ``The economic effects of future reductions are unlikely torequire legislation to convert the defense industry to non-defenseactivities, and that conversion directed by government mandatewould not be helpful,'' the study said.   It did recommend, however, that Congress ease the pain forworkers by reducing the budget deficit, which would lead to lowerinterest rates; improve conditions for investment by adjustments inthe tax system and encourage the use of commercial products indefense buying.   The report found that states heavily dependent on defensecontracts - California, Texas, New York, Connecticut, Massachusettsand Virginia - will feel the brunt of significant cuts in defensespending.   However, some states will be able to use the adjustmentassistance ``while others with large, varied and vibrant economiessuch as California and New York would probably not require it,''the report said.   The purpose of the report, which was provided to Sen. PaulSimon, D-Ill., was to determine the effect of U.S.-Soviet armscontrol agreements and the resulting cutbacks in defense spending.   The study found that savings resulting from such agreements willprobably be limited during the years immediately after the signingof arms control treaties.</TEXT></DOC>
