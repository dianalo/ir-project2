The debt is ``securitized,'' or restructured in the form ofbonds, and peddled in the credit markets in what has turned into amultibillion dollar business.   It works like this: Say a bank has a bunch of loans on its booksthat it wants to get rid of so it can meet net capital requirementsand loan more money. The bank creates a trust and ``sells'' theseloans to the trust.   The trust then turns the debt into bonds for sale to investors.When the monthly payments on the original loans come in, some ofthe money is passed on to the trust, which in turn gives some of itback to the bond investors as interest.   Along the way, the bank and the underwriter, often a Wall Streetinvestment house, take a cut in the interest paid on the originalloans, so that the investor in the securitized bonds may see ayield of 9 percent or so while the bank may be receiving 19 percenton the loan payments.   To be fair, not all the interest rate spread is profit for thebond issuers. Some must be used to buy letters of credit thatinsure the bondholders will be paid even if there are defaults byloan-holders, some represents reserves against such bad debt, andsome represents processing costs.   Still, it's a pretty neat deal for everyone involved. The bankgets unwanted loans off its books, investment houses have a newprofit generator, and investors have a place to put their moneythat yields more than Treasury bonds but is rated almost as safe.   No wonder the market for these ``asset-backed'' bonds hasboomed. Though the market originated in mortgage-backed securitiesin the 1970s, the first of the new-wave, non-mortgage issues cameto market in March 1985, according to Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. Sincethen, more than $44 billion in such bonds has been issued, MerrillLynch said.   Until the past few months, all asset-backed bonds were aimed atinstitutional investors, such as insurance companies and pensionfunds. The minimum investment required was in the millions ofdollars. But with the introduction of two new credit card-backedbonds, small investors can now take part.   The first of these issues was introduced in May by Citicorp. Thebonds are backed by payments on the big bank's credit card accountsand sold in chunks priced at $1,000 each.   These bonds have been dubbed ``plastic bonds'' from the nicknamefor credit cards. They were priced to yield about 9 percent _ farless than the 19.8 percent Citicorp charges in interest on thecredit cards themselves, but more than Treasuries. They are rated``AAA'' by the credit rating agencies.   The Citicorp bonds hold the potential for this interestingscenario: Some of the investors buying the bonds are most likelyamong the 600,000 Citicorp MasterCard and Visa card holderscreating the debt in the first place. So, in effect, theseinvestors are getting back some of the interest they pay on theircredit card accounts through the yield on the bonds.   The second asset-backed bond issue aimed at individual investorscame out last month and is backed by Sears, Roebuck and Co. creditcards. Both have been well-received, said Ira Weiss, who helpsmanage the marketing of these issues for Merrill Lynch.   ``Sales have been gratifying,'' he said. ``The yields are moreattractive than what they can find in alternative investments ofthe same quality.'' In addition, he said, investors receive amonthly interest payment, a convenience unavailable from otherbonds.   Merrill Lynch, which helped underwrite the Sears and Citicorpbonds, plans to market more credit-card bond issues to smallinvestors later this year, Weiss said.   He said credit-card issuers and other credit-creatinginstitutions will most likely jump at the chance to exploit thisnew market for asset-backed securities.   ``They have enormous amounts of assets on their balance sheetsthat they'd like to securitize,'' he said. ``It's in its infancy.''   Clifford Griep, a managing director at Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.,sees the same future for the institutional market.   ``The market is still assimilating the technology and I thinkwe're in a pretty rapid growth phase here,'' he said.   Sandamp;P predicts the public market for asset-backed bonds will top$20 billion this year.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday, July 31</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
