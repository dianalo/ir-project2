The St. Louis aerospace and data services concern said higher taxes and greater aircraft assembly-line costs offset a turnaround in its computer division.    Net fell to $92.6 million, or $2.29 a share, from $94.8 million, or $2.36 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.48 billion from $3.09 billion.    The results were in line with Wall Street projections for a flat fourth-quarter profit. McDonnell Douglas, which usually raises its quarterly dividend this time of year, boosted its payout to 58 cents a share from 52 cents, payable April 6 to shares of record Feb. 27.    McDonnell Douglas said cost-cutting helped the computer division generate its first pre-tax profit since it was started four years ago. The Information Systems Group had pre-tax earnings of $5.6 million compared with a $22.9 million loss for the 1985 quarter. While the group has been hurt by the slump in the computer industry, its losses largely have been generated by the company's strategy of rapidly amortizing the costs of acquiring computer companies. The computer division's latest fourth-quarter results included $38.8 million in amortization charges compared with $23.3 million in such charges a year ago.    McDonnell Douglas said pre-tax fourth-quarter earnings from its transport aircraft business, which excludes combat airplanes, fell 76% to $7.5 million despite a 17% rise in sales to $930.5 million. McDonnell Douglas blamed the thin earnings on costs associated with stepping up production of its MD-80 commercial jetliner and the expense of developing a shorter-fuselage, longer-range version of that aircraft.    McDonnell Douglas said its fourth-quarter earnings were also hurt by a 69% rise in income taxes. The company took a $7 million charge in the fourth quarter for the elimination of investment tax credits, a move mandated by the new federal tax laws. The company's fourth-quarter tax credit from foreign sales of aircraft fell to $2 million from $12.4 million for the year-ago fourth quarter because it delivered fewer aircraft abroad.    McDonnell Douglas registered earnings declines for each of its 1986 quarters. The company said net income for the year dropped 20% to $277.5 million, or $6.86 a share, from $345.7 million, or $8.60 a share.    Much of the earnings decline for the year was caused by previously reported pre-tax write-offs of $132.7 million. The company took a $61.6 million special charge in the first half to fix its AH-64 Apache helicopter. Modifications of the helicopter were ordered by the Army after the discovery of cracks in the main rotary blade of a test aircraft. In the third quarter, McDonnell Douglas took a $71.1 million charge for overestimating the sale price of the 138 CF-18 fighter jets it's delivering to Canada.    Sales for the year rose 10% to $12.66 billion from $11.48 billion.    For 1987, McDonnell Douglas said its pre-tax earnings from the transport aircraft sector might continue to be hurt by rising production costs and possible labor problems. The company is in talks with two unions, the United Auto Workers and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, about contracts that expired in October. However, the company said its 1987 pre-tax earnings will get about a $100 million boost from a new method of accounting for retirement costs.    The company's shares closed Friday at $75.75, up 87.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
