Former U.S. Attorney Dan K. Webb will lead the seminar on thefederal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Statute, orRICO, Karsten Mahlmann, BOT Chairman, said Tuesday.   Webb, who preceded the current U.S. attorney in Chicago, AntonValukas, also will prepare a legal document for the BOT's board ofdirectors on the parameters of the RICO statute, Mahlmann said.   The sweeping law, originally designed to wipe out organized crimeby taking the profit out of mob activity, has been applied to avariety of cases involving white-collar crime and fraud.   ``We have requested Mr. Webb to develop this legal memorandum andseminar for our membership in order to clarify misunderstandingssurrounding this statute,'' Mahlmann said.   He did not give a specific date but said Webb's seminar wouldtake place in about two weeks.   No charges have been announced, but attorneys for subpoenaedtraders say the statute could be used prosecuting those targeted inthe FBI sting operation at the Board of Trade and the rival ChicagoMercantile Exchange.   The federal government is reportedly investigating allegationsthat traders and others systematically cheated investors out ofmillions of dollars through illegal trading practices.   Valukas and FBI officials have declined to comment on theinvestigation.   Mahlmann told BOT members at a special meeting Tuesday theexchange may reconsider dual trading and explore electronic trading,two issues that have been hotly debated in light of theinvestigation, according to sources who attended the meeting.   Dual trading, the time-honored right of futures traders to bothtrade for their own accounts and fill customer orders, is seen bycritics as an open door to abuse of the traditional open-outcrystyle of commodities trading.   Electronic trading would use computers to match buy and sellorders, bypassing the 140-year-old ``open-outcry'' system in whichtraders crowd into recessed ``pits'' to execute trades through acombination of yelling and hand signals.   The meeting was the first membership meeting to be called sincethe disclosure of the probe Jan. 19.   The Board of Trade, with about 3,400 members, is the world'slargest futures exchange. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange rankssecond.   Federal authorities have issued more than 200 subpoenas totraders, firms and officials of the Board of Trade and the ChicagoMerc, seeking information about suspected fraudulent trading at thetwo exchanges.   The Board of Trade issued a statement saying only that it hadpresented to its membership a series of proposals that may be partof a package of recommendations to be sent to the exchange's boardof directors on Feb. 7.   But sources who attended the meeting said Mahlmann specificallymentioned dual trading as one of the trading practices that will beexamined by a task force drawn from the board of directors.   ``And he said the Board of Trade would be remiss if they did notlook at electronic trading,'' said a trader who spoke on conditionof anonymity.   ``I think they're just waking up to reality and smelling thecoffee,'' the trader said. ``Sooner or later we're going to haveelectronic trading.''   The Chicago Merc, which hopes to launch its Globex electronictrading system this summer, announced last week it had formed aspecial panel to review its rules and trading practices.</TEXT></DOC>
