Of 2,411 ballots cast, 97 percent of the writers on both coastsvoted to reject the producers' offer and 96 percent voted toauthorize a strike, said union spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.   Negotiators for the writers and producers planned to meet todayto see if a strike can be averted, union officials said.   First to feel the impact of a walkout would be daily daytime TVprograms and talk shows that use the most scripts with the leastlead time, such as Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show'' and ``LateNight with David Letterman.''   The effects on prime-time programs and feature films would beslight unless a strike was extended.   The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producersannounced that it had agreed to the latest negotiations even beforeEast Coast writers finished voting on whether to reject the latestcontract offer and authorize a strike.   The strike sentiment was already clear, based on the mood ofWest Coast members of the Writers Guild of America who votedTuesday night after union leaders unanimously recommended that thepact be rejected. The West Coast unit represents about 6,500 of theunion's 9,000 members.   The last strike by writers was three years ago and lasted twoweeks before writers voted to accept a contract that wasessentially the same as the one they had rejected before thatwalkout.   Many minor issues were resolved in a 21-hour bargaining sessionthat lasted until 7 a.m. Tuesday. but the union and producersremained deadlocked on three items that each side considers vital:   A ``creative rights'' issue that would give original writersmore more control over how their work is rewritten and ultimatelypresented; residual payments for foreign distribution; and arevision of residuals for domestic syndication of one-hourprograms, a market that is drying up.   Producers have resisted union demands on the first two issues,insisting that a writer's control over the script after it is soldshould be bargained individually, and that they can't afford toincrease foreign residuals.   The producers are seeking the syndication revision, which theunion opposes the change as a roll-back in current benefits.   Under the producers' proposal, one-hour programs could besyndicated locally with writers receiving only 50 percent of theirnormal residuals. If the program is later syndicated nationally,they would receive an additional 100 percent of residuals.   The median annual income for writers is $40,000, but about halfof the WGA's members are unemployed at any given time. The old pactexpired Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
