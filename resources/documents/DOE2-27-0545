The plant was completed five months ahead of schedule,despite the three months of delay in construction work in early 1984resulting from a court order. Also the costs were kept within the frameworkof estimates. A similarly positive development can be seen in the statusof completion of the other two convoy plants, Emsland and Neckarwestheim-2.Emsland is at present in its 100% power trial phase of operation, andNeckarwestheim will reach the nuclear commissioning stage probably bythe end of the year. From the present state of completion it appearsas if all deadlines and goals could be met without any compromise. Nuclearpower plants today are the backbone of a broad-based energy supply conceptdeveloped or reasons of energy economy and energy policy alike, whichensures that the energy necessary to maintain an industrialized societyis made available in a sufficient quantity and at internationally competitiveprices.</TEXT></DOC>
