An opposition coalition of 21 parties scheduled rallies for a``day of protest'' Saturday and denounced Thursday's balloting,which they boycotted.   At least 13 people were reported killed and more than 300 wereinjured in election violence, and reporters who visited pollingplaces found evidence of a low voter turnout and widespread voterigging.   With results announced Friday for 218 of the 299 Parliamentseats up for grabs, the president's party had won 194.   A coalition of 73 small factions known as the CombinedOpposition Parties won 12, two other small parties had one each,and independents won seven. Voting was canceled in one districtwhere a candidate was slain. The other 30 seats in the 330-seatParliament are reserved for women, who will be chosen later.   In the 1986 elections, Jatiya won 157 seats, but its majorityrose to 210 after wheeling and dealing with independents and theaddition of the 30 seats for women. Those traditionally go to thegoverning party.   The vote did not end the stalemate between Ershad and hisleading opponents, Sheik Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Ziaof the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.   The women vowed to persist in their campaign against Ershad, andMs. Hasina declared, ``We will topple this corrupt government.''They have been organizing anti-Ershad demonstrations and strikessince Nov. 10.   Bangladesh journalists decided to stop work for a night toprotest government restrictions on the press that were imposedunder a national state of emergency in November.   Reazuddin Ahmed, president of the Bangladesh Federal Union ofJournalists representing about 1,500 journalists across thecountry, said government officials had been phoning newspapers eachnight and telling them not to publish news of anti-governmentactivities.   He said they were told not to publish news of a low voterturnout or election violence.   Most newspapers seemed to have kept low profile about reportingviolence or election fraud.   The action will result in non-publication of about 15Dhaka-based dailies and half a dozen more outside Dhaka onSaturday. Two national news agencies will also be affected.   Ershad said he expected the new Parliament to serve out its fullfive-year term.   Ershad dissolved the Parliament last December, 3{ years early,in a move to compromise with the opposition. The oppositiondeclared a boycott of the election.   The former lieutenant took power in a bloodless coup in 1982 andwas elected president in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
