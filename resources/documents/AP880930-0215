MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Newspaper executives say they're willing tochange newsprint suppliers or seek overseas paper sources inresponse to another boost in North American newsprint prices, whichthey claim is unjustified.   Their reaction follows reports that major Canadian newsprintmakers, which supply most U.S. newspapers, are raising their pricesto $695 a metric ton from $650 on Jan. 1.   Bowater Inc., the largest U.S. newsprint producer, was thelatest to notify customers on Thursday.   ``This is the dumbest time in five years that I can think of toraise prices and that's why I think people will resist it,'' saidone executive of a large U.S. newspaper concern, who spoke oncondition of anonymity. ``The threat of not renewing contracts isbig.''   Newspaper executives say demand for newsprint is downdramatically due largely to a fall in retail advertising and theplanned 6.9 percent increase therefore is not warranted. They alsosay a buildup in newsprint inventories will enable them to cutorders for higher-priced paper.   Canadian companies, which provide about 56 percent of thenewsprint used in the United States, say they need the increasebecause the effects of last January's 6.6 percent rise were erasedby a decline in the U.S. dollar. They also say their raw materialcosts have risen.   ``We've told our suppliers that if they proceed in the amountand timing that they've announced that we will take whatevermethods and effort we have to take in order not to buy newsprintfrom them now or in the future,'' said Homer Taylor, vice presidentof supply at Knight-Ridder Inc., one of the nation's biggestnewspaper groups.   Other media companies, representing hundreds of dailynewspapers, also said they plan to fight the increase.   Newsprint prices have risen approximately 288 percent since1970, when a metric ton cost $179. Prices are up more than 21percent in the last three years alone.   Newsprint accounts for the largest portion of the industry'scosts behind labor. It can range anywhere between 13 percent oftotal publishing costs for smaller newspapers to about 25 percentfor larger dailies, Wall Street analysts estimate.   Newspapers say their profits are being squeezed by the highernewsprint costs combined with weakness in advertising, whichprovides the bulk of newspapers' revenue.   John Houghton, president of Quebec andamp; Ontario Paper Co., whichalso has announced a price increase, disputed the argument thatdemand for newsprint was weak.   ``This is the best balance we've had since 1981 in terms ofsupply and demand,'' he said.   Houghton argued that while retail advertising was not as strongas in the past, ``it's already at a good level.''   The Newspaper Advertising Bureau said advertising, includingretail, national and classified ads, was up only 3 percent in thefirst quarter from a year earlier. Retail advertising was up just 1percent.   The American Newspaper Publishers Association, meanwhile, saidnewsprint usage declined the past five months. In August,consumption was down 4.7 percent compared with a year ago mainlybecause there was one less Sunday. Without the Sunday difference,consumption was down 1.7 percent in August.   Eric Philo, an analyst with the investment firm Goldman, Sachs andamp;Co., said he did not foresee much improvement in demand well into1989, aside from the normal pickup in the fourth quarter forChristmas advertising.   ``Revenue won't pick up and demand won't start growing more thanit has in the next several months,'' he said.   Newspaper executives said they could fight the price increase bygoing to suppliers who would give them discounts and better prices,including overseas to Japan, Italy or Scandinavian countries, whoalso make newsprint.   Some analysts said newspapers might be in the position at leastto postpone the increase until later next year.   ``If they have significant inventories built they won't beforced to go on ordering from the higher-priced companies. They canget tonnage from other sources at a lower price,'' said LindaLieberman, an analyst with Mabon, Nugent andamp; Co.   Analysts say with newsprint inventories are higher than normaland capacity expanding by about 5 percent next year, newspapers maybe able to put off the price increases, at least for awhile.</TEXT></DOC>
