The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained a marginal 18.52points, or 0.05 percent, ending at 35,768.64. It was yet anotherhigh.   ``The index made nervous ups and downs during trading, becauseparticipants failed to determine the market direction,'' saidMasaya Hashizume, a dealer with Nikko Securities Co.   He said investors changed their buying targets from one issue toanother, contributing to nervous fluctuations in the index.   ``That's partly because many investors have been unsure aboutexternal factors including foreign exchange and interest rates,''he said.   Market players bought issues such as steels and electric powerplants toward the end of the afternoon session, helping the indexrecover, Hashizume said.   An estimated 900 million shares changed hands today, up fromMonday's 750 million.   The dollar closed unchanged from its opening at 143.80 yen, up0.25 yen from Monday's close of 143.55 yen. The currency rangedbetween 143.60 yen and 143.85 yen.   ``The dollar-yen rate stayed almost the same all day,'' a traderwith Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo said on condition of anonymity.   After opening higher following a similar upswing in New York,the dollar fluctuated narrowly as investors sold and bought forprofit-taking and position adjustments, he said.   In earlier trading, the dollar fell as securities firms andforeign banks sold the currency for profit-taking, but it recoveredin the afternoon as trading houses bought it, he said.   ``At any rate, the currency would not move much prior to theauction of the U.S. government bonds and releases of a series ofeconomic indicators this week,'' the trader said.   The United States is to announce the nation's major economicindicators including the retail price index due out later today andrevised trade figures for September, slated for Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
