Negotiators for the Air Line Pilots Association told leaders ofNorthwest pilots Tuesday night that a breakdown in contract talks``may be near.''   But they also said that agreement on a new contract could bereached ``within a matter of hours'' if NWA Inc. management wouldbargain in a reasonable and responsive manner.'' NWA is the parentcompany of Northwest Airlines.   A spokesman for Northwest did not immediately return a phone callWednesday.   Meanwhile, the Northwest pilots Master Executive Council of ALPAstopped short Tuesday night of endorsing Checchi's $4 billion planto buy NWA.   ``They stopped short of a complete endorsement of his buyoutplan, but judged his financial and business plans to be viable,''union spokesman Jim Halverson said Wednesday.   Earlier Tuesday, former Republic Airlines pilots now working forthe Eagan-based Northwest embraced Checchi's $121-per-share takeoverbid.   Halverson said the mediated contract talks were set to resumeWednesday afternoon. Remaining issues are job security, work rulesand pay, he said.   Before a strike could occur, an impasse in contract talks wouldhave to be decided by the National Mediation Board. If an impassewere declared, it would be followed by a 30-day cooling-off period,after which the pilots would be free to strike.   Checchi said Wednesday his group intends to close the buyout dealdespite the strike threat. He said he considered the actions by theRepublic and the Northwest Master Executive Council on his buyoutplan ``very encouraging.''   He also said he didn't know when the deal would be completed, butit was ``pending very shortly.''   Last week, sources close to the transaction said Checchi expectedto complete the deal before Aug. 1, the St. Paul Pioneer PressDispatch reported Saturday. The Star Tribune, also quotingunidentified sources in its Saturday edition, said Checchi mightclose the deal by Friday.   Checchi also said Wednesday that a contract settlement might bereached before the deal is closed.   ``These pilots and the company have been involved in negotiationsfor almost two years and that process seems to be coming to asatisfactory conclusion,'' he said. ``It's my understanding they'revery close and, sometimes when you get closest, it's kind of a pointof maximum frustration for both sides.''   Former Republic Airlines pilots who joined Northwest in theacquisition of Republic in 1986 have been without a contract for thepast 2{ years while the contract covering Northwest pilots expiredthree years ago.   Talks to bring the pilots under one pact began in April 1987 andbroke off last November, when 96 percent voted to authorize astrike. Northwest then requested federal mediation and the talksresumed in December.   Northwest spokesmen said last week that, as long as talkscontinued, an agreement was possible.   But in the ALPA statement issued Wednesday, pilot leadersexpressed ``increasing impatience'' with the lack of progress incontract talks and said a breakdown ``seems inevitable if talksaimed at a new contract do not produce an agreement within a matterof days.''   As for the Checchi buyout plan, Halverson said Northwest pilotleaders ``had some difficulty in divorcing an endorsement of theChecchi buyout proposal from a lack of progress in contractnegotiations.''   ``He (Checchi) has been saying it's a done deal. On the otherhand, he says he has little or no influence in contractnegotiations,'' Halverson said. ``And we're saying it's difficult toreconcile those two statements.''   Checchi said Wednesday he doesn't own the airline and, therefore,it ``would be totally inappropriate for me to be involved incontractual negotiations of an enterprise that I don't control.''   Halverson said Northwest pilots are concerned about the ``largedebt load'' in the buyout offer. ``That's a problem for allpilots,'' he said.   The Northwest pilots, however, did conclude that the buyout plan``appears viable'' from a business and financial standpoint. TheNorthwest group passed a resolution saying it endorses the Checchigroup's ``stated intentions for market growth, expanded employmentopportunity and the promise of harmonious employee-employerrelations.''   The Republic Master Executive Council called Checchi's proposalthe best available option to provide ``stability and growthpotential'' for NWA and its workers.   But union spokesman Curt Kruse said Tuesday that former Republicpilots' endorsement of Checchi's buyout offer doesn't mean pilotsare pleased about the pace of contract negotiations. He alsostressed that the pilots still have concerns over the debt Northwestwould incur.   ``Nobody is entirely pleased with increasing the debt atNorthwest,'' Kruse said. ``However, once we had an opportunity toreview his (Checchi's) financial plan, our concerns diminishedsomewhat. We still have concerns.''   The Northwest MEC represents about 3,000 of the total 5,000pilots employed by Northwest. The rest are represented by theRepublic Airlines MEC.</TEXT></DOC>
