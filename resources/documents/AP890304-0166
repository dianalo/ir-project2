Some of the recent developments supporting the current rally,such as labor strife in Peru and shipping problems in Zaire, arefamiliar to those who have followed copper on its mostly upwardcourse during the past two years.   Other factors _ the fear of AIDS in Africa, for example _ havenot been widely cited before.   But underpinning the gains are the same basic circumstances thatprompted copper's runup from around 65 cents a pound in the springof 1987 to the record high of $1.6475 a pound set last Dec. 8 on NewYork's Commodity Exchange: strong demand and tight supplies.   The supply tightness appeared to be easing earlier this yearfollowing the settlement in mid-December of a 57-day miners' strikein Peru, the world's sixth-largest copper producer.   A subsequent increase in supplies of copper deliverable againstCommodity Exchange contracts contributed to a selloff that droppedthe price of spot copper on the exchange to $1.257 a pound byValentine's Day.   But world demand for copper remained strong, a function of theeconomic growth of industrialized nations. Then shippingdifficulties resurfaced in Zambia and Zaire, respectively theworld's fourth- and seventh-largest copper producers, sparking newwaves of speculative buying.   The rally continued in the past week on fears of another extendedstrike in Peru after miners there called for a 3-day work stoppage,beginning March 26, to protest management's failure to comply withthe terms of the December agreement.   Copper for spot delivery on the Commodity Exchange jumped 5.6cents Friday amid persistent supply concerns to $1.53 a pound.   Fred Demler, metals economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,said the copper market looks strong on all fronts.   ``The consumption numbers show very strong growth, thefundamentals look good, the technical signals look good, physicalstocks are low _ it's beginning to look like a replay of 1987 and1988,'' he said.   The shortage of copper was underscored by the small amount ofcopper available for delivery against the Commodity Exchangecontract due to expire on March 29.   As of the beginning of trading on Friday, exchange inventories ofdeliverable copper totaled 17,446 tons. Open interest in the Marchcontract _ the number of contracts still to be settled by either anoffsetting trade or physical delivery _ was 9,427 contracts, theequivalent of 117,838 tons.   The vast majority of futures contracts are settled by offsettingtrades, not physical delivery, but analysts say the unusually wideimbalance is one indication of extreme supply tightness.   The United States and Canada produce nearly 30 percent of theworld's refined copper but much of the remainder comes from ThirdWorld countries where political upheavals, labor disputes, terroristbombings, crumbling transportation systems and equipmentmalfunctions occasionally disrupt mining and refinery operations.   The frequency of such interruptions seems to have increased alongwith the demand for and price of copper. During the past year, majordisruptions occurred in Peru, Chile, Zambia and Zaire, all majorcopper producers.   Market analyst George Anagnos of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.in New York contends African production also has been hampered bythe flight of mining engineers from the continent due to fear ofAIDS.   The deadly disease has spread rapidly in some part of Africa.   ``Concerns over the disease are particularly prevalent among theEuropeans, primarily Belgian engineers who have been hired tooperate the mines in Zaire,'' Anagnos wrote in a recent report.``The decision by many of the engineers to leave the nation hasexacerbated prevailing diplomatic problems between Belgium and Zaire(formerly a Belgian colony) and resulted in supply losses.''   The AIDS angle may seem trivial but it doesn't take much to movea market made nervous by supply tightness.   ``Given the right conditions, you could see new highs,'' saidCraig Sloane, an analyst in New York with Smith Barney Harris Uphamandamp; Co. ``A lot of things are possible in a market like this.''
