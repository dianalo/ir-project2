A Sunbeam spokesman said Los Angeles-based Chiat/Day was selected yesterday as the agency for a new product that will generate billings of about $13 million a year. The spokesman declined to identify the product or to disclose the company's total ad billings.    The spokesman for Sunbeam, a unit of Pittsburgh-based Allegheny, declined to comment on whether the company would eventually phase out Burton-Campbell completely, saying only that Sunbeam felt it &quot;had to look at a larger agency renowned for its marketing capabilities.&quot; Though relatively small, Chiat/Day has gained a strong reputation for its creative work.    Ron Scharbo, president of Atlanta-based Burton-Campbell, said &quot;We have every intention of doing the best job we can on the remaining portion of the (Sunbeam advertising) budget.&quot;    Burton-Campbell wasn't a contender to handle the advertising for the new product. Among those considered were Minneapolis-based Campbell-Mithun Advertising; Chicago-based Bayer Bess Vanderwarker and Flynn; and Della Femina, Travisano andamp; Partners Inc. and Jordan, McGrath, Case andamp; Taylor Inc., both of New York. </TEXT></DOC>
