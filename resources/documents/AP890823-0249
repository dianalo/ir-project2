(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Disappointing second-quarter salesprompted Eastman Kodak Co. to announce a reorganization planWednesday that will trim 4,500 jobs from its worldwide payroll thisyear.   The photo company acknowledged the cuts were 3,500 jobs abovewhat had been previously forecast. Kodak employs 145,000 peopleworldwide.   Kodak will also restructure or divest businesses with annualrevenues of $1.25 billion through sale, closure or reorganizationand implement ``substantial reductions in operating costs.''   Kodak spokesman Paul Allen said the company wouldn't reveal whichof its units would be effected, but some have speculated on itsInformation Systems business segment, which include copiers,microfilm and graphics equipment, might be targeted.   For the second quarter of 1989, that segment posted a $144million loss.   The company said the moves are being made to raise $1 billion inoperating cash during 1990.   Allen could not provide specifics on where the jobs would be lost.   Colby H. Chandler, the company's chairman and chief executiveofficer, said, ``We have dealt with adversity in the past, but neverwith such broad-based intensity. These uncharacteristic actions arebeing carried out with great resolve by the entire management team.''   It's been a tough decade for the photography industry giant,which had turned around a sagging bottom line twice in the 1980s,only to see the same problems _ increased competition, a rising U.S.dollar and higher costs _ return to eat away at profits.   Thousands of workers were laid off in 1983, and in 1986, 10,000more were laid off. In both instances, profits rose substantiallythe next year.   The company also said it would put ``increasing emphasis onincentive compensation and benefits by placing at risk up to 40percent of annual management pay.''   And in Rochester, where the company's headquarters and severalplants are located, Kodak said it would suspend changes in thestructure of wages and salaries in 1990.   Chandler said the actions ``invade sacred areas of the companybut are a needed remedy for the ills that have resulted indisappointing second-quarter results.''   On Aug. 1, the company announced earnings fell 85 percent in thesecond quarter, down to $60 million, or 18 cents a share, from arecord $390 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier.   For the first half of 1989, earnings fell 60 percent to $260million, or 80 cents a share, from $650 million, or $2 a share, ayear earlier.   Chandler said units would attack excessive costs by cutting backon excessive inventories and by shortening the length of timebetween sales and receipt of payment.   With regard to Kodak business groups and support organizationsreducing their operating costs, Chandler said ``nothing is sacred,''including administrative expense, distribution costs, research anddevelopment, advertising expenses and product costs.   The company also said it would revise the formula for determiningany future dividends paid to senior management in 1990 and alleligible employees in 1991 and beyond.   Individual employee wage dividends will range from a minimum of 5percent to a maximum of 15 percent of that individual's currentannual pay, depending on corporate performance. The current range isapproximately 9 to 10 percent.   ``By placing more management compensation at risk and relatingthe wage dividend more directly to corporate financial performance,we are creating an effective incentive not only to enhance theindividual financial rewards for all Kodak employees, but to improvethe competitive position of the company,'' Chandler said.</TEXT></DOC>
