In question are issues of new stock with full voting rights but valued at a fraction of existing shares. Because Hong Kong's takeover code is based on voting rights, the new stock would allow shareholders to maintain stakes in a company at a low cost even if the concern issued full-value shares to pay for acquisitions or expansions.    The exchange said it wants to establish a &quot;general principle&quot; in the matter. It didn't say when that would occur.    Friday, Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. said it would swap four new shares for one ordinary share, which would be renamed class A. Each new, class B share would be valued at one-tenth an existing share.    As word spread that the securities commissioner and the exchange had been apprised of Jardine's new issue and hadn't objected, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. followed suit.    Brokers criticized the new issues because they could undermine local confidence by enabling major shareholders to retain control of local concerns without correspondingly heavy equity investment from now to 1997, when Hong Kong will revert to Chinese sovereignty.    The market is concerned &quot;sinister things&quot; might happen, said Jim Walker, managing director of Winfull Laing andamp; Cruickshank Securities Ltd. &quot;You could control 51% of a company's votes by owning only 5% of its equity.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
