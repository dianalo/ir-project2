As the twentieth century moved along, congressional investigation became more and more a device to dramatize facts already known. . . . If the investigative power of Congress is unlimited, the separation of powers, and system of checks and balances must break down. Yet there is no reason for the investigative power to be carried to its extreme against the executive. The Founding Fathers were much too fearful of legislative tyranny not to anticipate situations like this. . . . It will be the ambition of the presidency alone that will protect the independence of his branch from unwarranted interference. </TEXT></DOC>
