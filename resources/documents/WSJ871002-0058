Earlier this week, Entertainment Publications said it expected the cash bid, which is valued at about $129 million.    The publisher of discount-coupon books said it formed an independent committee of the board to review the bid and make a recommendation. That review is expected to be completed within 30 days. If approved by the committee, the bid will be submitted for holder approval, the company said, adding that completion of the transaction depends on obtaining necessary financing.    Kidder Peabody has given a standby commitment to provide as much as $100 million of the financing, and the balance would come from equity participants and company resources, Entertainment Publications said.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Entertainment Publications closed at $25.50, down 25 cents.    The buy-out group includes Hughes L. Potiker, president, and his wife, Sheila M. Potiker, executive vice president. The Potikers hold about 42% of the company's stock.    In a leveraged buy-out, investors finance an acquisition largely with debt that eventually is repaid from operations or the sale of assets. </TEXT></DOC>
