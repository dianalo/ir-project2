The prime minister, however, ruled out opposition party demandsfor the resignation of his entire Cabinet.   ``I feel strongly that it is my responsibility (now) to tacklereform of the Public Election Law and the Political FundsRegulations Law in order to accurately abide with politicalethics,'' he was quoted as saying during a visit to Shizuoka, 95miles west of Tokyo.   The prime minister's remarks came one day after the TokyoDistrict Public Prosecutors' Office indicted four people on briberycharges in connection to the Recruit Co. stock-profiteering scandal.   Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and former chairman of Recruit Co., aninformation-employment conglomerate, was among the four arrested onFeb. 13 on charges of bribery or violation of the nation'ssecurities exchange law. Four others have also been apprehended byauthorities but have yet to be charged.   Recruit officials reportedly sold about 687,000 unlisted sharesof the real estate subsidiary Recruit-Cosmos Co. at bargain pricesto politicians, their aides and other prominent figures up untilSeptember 1986.   Although he has repeatedly denied direct involvement, Takeshitais among 17 politicians _ four of them from the opposition _implicated in the stock trading scandal.   An estimated 160 select individuals purchased the prelistedshares and were then able to reap large, tax-free profits shortlyafter they were offered for over-the-counter trading in October 1986.   Opposition party leaders and critics say the stock dealsrepresent influence-buying and have stepped up demands thatTakeshita resign or clarify his role in the scandal. They have alsocalled on Yasuhiro Nakasone, who served as prime minister during thespan of the Recruit stock transactions, to appear before theJapanese Parliament to answer questions regarding his part in theaffair.   Takeshita on Sunday said Nakasone had already made clear hisinvolvment in a recent press conference but added it was up toParliament to decide whether to summon the former leader forquestioning.   Public support for the Takeshita Cabinet has dropped steadilyover the past five months due to the scandal, as well as governmentplans to levy a 3-percent tax on all services and goods incommercial transactions, according to media polls.</TEXT></DOC>
