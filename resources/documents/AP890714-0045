Howard Metzenbaum seeks silence.   The Ohio Democrat is going out of his way to try to convince hiscolleagues to leave the Constitution alone.   ``Compared to the events that have shaped the Constitution, theburning of the flag in Texas by an obscure protestor was a blip onthe screen of history,'' Metzenbaum told members of a Housesubcommittee Thursday.   ``But we will magnify it a thousandfold if it stampedes us intoeroding the majesty of the Constitution,'' he said. ``We must notturn this foolish offensive act into an historic event.''   Metzenbaum didn't seem to make any headway.   The House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutionalrights remained focused on taking flag desecration off the list ofprotected forms of political dissent. The issue for the panel isn'twhether to reverse a recent Supreme Court ruling, but how to goabout it.   The political outcry came after the Supreme Court ruled lastmonth that the 1984 conviction of a man who burned a flag in aDallas protest was unconstitutional because his actions were coveredby First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech.   Metzenbaum acknowledged he's up against a ``political tidalwave,'' but said he felt obliged to wade in. ``I would hope theCongress would have backbone and will not try to change the Bill ofRights,'' he said.   Even with action scheduled on the other side of Capitol Hill onone of his pet projects, Metzenbaum sat patiently in the Househearing room, listening to more than an hour of speeches, analysisand dire predictions of the foul things that could happen without astrong flag protection measure.   When he got his turn, Metzenbaum stuck to his script, readingslowly and calmly as he urged restraint.   He evoked images of the excessive government reaction topolitical protest in China and told the panel it is ``the right toprotest even when it is offensive that makes us different from therest of the world.''   ``Is the political breast-beating on this issue based on a realconcern about a threat to this nation's values or security? No,''Metzenbaum told the committee. ``We are engaged in a crude form ofpolitical one-upmanship, a crass competition about who loves theflag more.   ``During times of heated passions our national leaders shouldcall forth the best in us _ the love of freedom that has made us themodel for the world,'' he said. ``The flag dispute has insteadreduced the political debate to shameful and crass demagoguery.''   If the forces behind the amendment drive were offended theydidn't let on.   Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the ranking Republican onthe subcommittee and one of the loudest pro-amendment voices,complimented Metzenbaum's testimony.   ``You have taken an intellectually honest approach for one who ison the other side,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
