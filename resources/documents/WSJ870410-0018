He also said that the raisin characters in the TV ads aren't similar to raisin creatures used promotionally by the plaintiff, Robert Reiter, a Plattsburgh, N.Y., raisin-product distributor. The controversy was the subject of a recent front-page article in The Wall Street Journal.    Judge Coyle granted motions for dismissal filed by five of the nine defendants, including the California Raisin Advisory Board, a raisin growers and packers group that sponsored the ads, and Foote, Cone andamp; Belding, the ad agency that produced the commercials. </TEXT></DOC>
