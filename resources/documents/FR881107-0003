This rule amends Supplement No. 3 to Part779, ``Computer Software,'' by reducing the restrictions on software forLAN equipment that has been previously decontrolled for export. This revisionhas resulted from a review of strategic controls maintained by the U.S.and allied countries through the Coordinating Committee (COCOM). Such multilateralcontrols restrict the availability of strategic items to controlled countries.With the concurrence of the Department of Defense, the Department of Commercehas determined that this rule is necessary to protect U.S. national securityinterests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective November 7, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>For questions of a technical natureregarding computer software, call Raj Dheer, Computer Systems TechnologyCenter, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Telephone: (202) 377-0708.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements </ITAG>1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 2. This rule does not contain a collection of information subject to therequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.   5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruleimplements regulatory changes based on COCOM review and because it doesnot impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule. Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, as with other Departmentof Commerce rules, comments from the public are always welcome.
