A previous incident occurredon August 21, 1987, during descent through 8,900 feet with similar weatherand flight conditions. While the precise cause of the flameouts has notbeen established, the FAA has determined that certain operational measuresmust be taken which will reduce the potential for engine flameout underthese conditions.On June 14, 1988, the FAA issued telegraphic AD T88-13-51 (which supersededtelegraphic AD T88-11-51), applicable to all Model 737-300 series airplanes,which requires a revision to the Limitations Section of the AFM to requireoperation with a minimum N<T2>1</T2> engine speed of 45 percent, engine ignition in the FLIGHT positionwhen flying in moderate to severe precipitation, and a cautionary noteadvising that flight in moderate to severe thunderstorm activity is tobe avoided. This is considered to be an interim action, pending a completeevaluation as to the causes of the flameouts, at which time the FAA mayconsider further rulemaking action.Since a situation existed, and still exists, that requires immediate adoptionof this regulation, it is found that notice and public procedure hereonare impracticable, and good cause exists for making this amendment effectivein less than 30 days.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The Federal Aviation Administration had determined that this regulationis an emergency regulation that is not considered to be major under ExecutiveOrder 12291. It is impracticable for the agency to follow the proceduresof Order 12291 with respect to this rule since the rule must be issuedimmediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been furtherdetermined that this document involves an emergency regulation under DOTRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 29, 1979). Ifthis action is subsequently determined to involve a significant/major regulation,a final regulatory evaluation or analysis, as appropriate, will be preparedand placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluation or analysisis not required).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 or Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
