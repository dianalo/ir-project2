I personally found the review amusing because it containedso many funny lines -- apart from the obvious misstatements-- like &quot;and my mother is Scheherazade.&quot; I was even gratefulfor the review because of the calls I received yesterday fromso many people I greatly respect, who, frankly, I didn't evenknow supported my work.</LP><TEXT>   Thus, while my first inclination was to ignore the reviewentirely, the outpouring of support received for the book,from Sam Walton to Julian Simon, encouraged me to respond.   The central premise of the theory of &quot;Economic Alchemy&quot; --that advancing technology has freed us from the zero-sum gamewhere one person's gain must be another person's loss -- isin direct contrast to much traditional economic thought. Iwould have expected to see in The Wall Street Journal adebate on this central issue, not a sarcastic and misleadingcommentary on my professionalism.   For example, the review states that my book &quot;omitsattributions&quot; and &quot;borrows freely from the ideas of&quot; peopleranging from George Gilder to Julian Simon without &quot;murmuringtheir names.&quot; I find this statement puzzling, to say theleast, because Mr. Gilder's thoughts and books are quoted andacknowledged several times (see pages 68-69) and I havereceived numerous letters praising the book directly frommost of the people whose ideas I am accused of &quot;borrowing,&quot;including Julian Simon.   The statement that the book does not contain extensiveempirical data and serious equations is correct. But this wasdeliberate. Although I spent almost a year quantifying suchconcepts as the &quot;technology gap,&quot; all of this work was(correctly) omitted by my publisher in editing ageneral-interest book.   Your reviewer correctly surmised that the title wasreworked to &quot;pre-empt some mean-spirited reviewer&quot; fromattacking the book (the original title was &quot;Alchemy&quot;).Unfortunately, it was obviously not reworked enough.   But the title of the book is not the issue; the ideasexpressed in it are, and deserved more serious commentary inyour review.

While not mentioned in the book's text or index, hewas cited in two footnotes and a bibliography. -- Ed.)</TEXT></DOC>
