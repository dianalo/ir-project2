The government will disclose on Friday how much payrolls grew in the month when it releases the unemployment rate.    The growth in non-farm payrolls is closely watched by financial markets and economists, but the telephone workers' strike will distort the August tally. Payrolls grew by 169,000 in July.    The Labor Department said that the 108,000 figure includes 136,000 telephone workers going on strike, as well as 20,000 miners and 8,000 grocery-store workers returning to work. </TEXT></DOC>
