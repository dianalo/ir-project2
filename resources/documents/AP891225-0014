Snow drifts stood up to 8 feet high in South Carolina, andWilmington, N.C., recorded its greatest snowfall ever _ at least 15inches. The blizzard caused a 600-foot Navy tanker to run agroundon North Carolina's Outer Banks.   But warmer weather moved eastward with temperatures hitting 40at Chamberlain, S.D., and Minneapolis warmed into the 20s afternearly five straight days below zero. Kansas City, Mo., had aDecember record of 16 below zero Saturday, but highs in the 30s and40s were predicted in the region Monday.   Temperatures also rebounded into the low 50s in Texas, buttemperatures as low as 11 degrees over the weekend devastated thelower Rio Grande Valley's citrus crop, and forecasters predictedmore freezing weather on Christmas Day.   ``It's going to take probably weeks and maybe months todetermine how much damage we've had,'' said Richard Hensz, directorof the Texas Aandamp;I University Citrus Center in Weslaco. ``But it'svery extensive.''   At 5 a.m. Sunday, the wind chill at Orlando, Fla., was about 5below zero compared with 5 above at Minneapolis-St. Paul, theNational Weather Service said.   At least 83 deaths have been blamed on the weather since Dec. 15from the Plains to the East Coast.   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez declared a state of emergency Sundayas even Miami plunged to 31 degrees. The cold damaged citrus, sugarcane and strawberries, stranded holiday travelers and forcedutilities to impose rolling blackouts.   Record lows were recorded Sunday in nearly every major Floridacity, from 11 in Pensacola to 44 at Key West, where the previousrecord of 47 had stood since 1906.   Records were reported in 56 cities in Alabama, Arkansas,Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia, the weather servicesaid.   Authorities at Plattsburgh, N.Y., spent part of Sunday workingto blast open ice jams on the Saranac River that caused floodingthat forced more than 120 people from their homes at a trailerpark. The city near the Canadian border had a low of 19 below zero.   Martinez overnight mobilized National Guardsmen and other stateworkers to rescue motorists from gridlocked, icy highways. Withmany motels packed, emergency shelters were opened in six northernFlorida counties and 5,200 people spent the night in them,officials said.   ``There is no one smiling in Florida agriculture today,'' saidRoy Parke of Parkesdale Farms in Plant City, self-proclaimed winterstrawberry capital of the nation.   The airport for Wilmington, N.C., was shut down by snow Saturdaymorning and remained closed Sunday. Snow also closed the airport atMyrtle Beach, S.C.   In Florida, the Jacksonville and Gainesville airports remainedclosed because of icy runways Sunday. Air service was nearly backto normal in Tallahassee and Daytona Beach after numerouscancellations Saturday.   The North Carolina coast got the most snow Sunday. At least 15inches fell at Wilmington, eclipsing the city's all-time record of12{ inches on Feb. 9 and 10, 1973.   The Hyde County, N.C., sheriff's department reported drifts of 6to 8 feet. Only large, dual-wheel trucks were able to travel, andsome of them got stuck.   Wind blowing at 50 to 60 mph on the Outer Banks islands offNorth Carolina knocked down power lines as fast as utility crewscould get them back up. Three beach cottages were tossed into theocean.   It'll be the first white Christmas in Wilmington since 1870 andon the Outer Banks since 1874, the weather service said.   Early Sunday, the tow line between a tugboat and the Navy tankerBenjamin Isherwood broke or came off, said Lt. Cmdr. StephenBurnett. The vessel drifted until about 4:30 p.m., when it ranaground, Burnett said.   Naval officials said the vessel carried no fuel and no injurieswere reported.   Along the South Carolina coast, the resort town of Myrtle Beachhad 14 inches of snow on the ground Sunday and 8 inches blanketedstreets in Charleston.   ``I just moved up from Florida in time for (Hurricane) Hugo, andnow this,'' said Rick Hawkins in Charleston. ``Isn't it lovely?It's a mess.''   In Florida, Parke of Parkesdale Farms said he expected 40percent losses. The state's winter strawberry crop is worth some$162 million.   ``Significant'' damage was reported to Florida's $3.5 billioncitrus crop and possible damage to the $1.6 billion sugar industry,Martinez said. The governor's emergency declaration authorized thestate Department of Transportation to loosen weight restrictions onroads and bridges to help growers move freeze-damaged crops quickly.   Not everyone complained. ``This is nice. It's not Christmaswithout some cold,'' said Louis Dussault of Montreal, strollingMiami Beach on Sunday with his wife and two children. The city inCanada had a low of 6 below zero.   Florida utilities, faced with high demand for electricity,called for conservation and said there was no excess power to bebought from frigid Northern states, meaning rotating blackoutswould be imposed for many Floridians through Christmas morning.   Snow dusted some northern Florida cities, such as Jacksonville,where icicles hung Sunday morning from rooftops and ice closedroads and bridges.   ``It's a winter wonderland in Jacksonville,'' said Mayor TommyHazouri. ``It's a beautiful sight for a city that doesn't get snowvery often, and it's also a dangerous situation for the samereason.''   ``They can take it back,'' grumbled resident Randy Dukes. ``Iwant a green Christmas.''</TEXT></DOC>
