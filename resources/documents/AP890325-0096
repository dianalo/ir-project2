PhilGramm's budgetary crusades all pose a potential threat to the $4.6billion superconducting super collider, a Texas congressman says.   ``To the extent Wright is weakened by any events related to thisethics committee thing, it will also weaken our ability to get thesuper collider,'' Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, said.   Bryant expressed doubt that a coming report from the HouseEthics Committee concerning his finances would wound the speaker.But he said unfavorable findings from the panel ``could bedevastating'' to the future of the super collider _ a massiveparticle accelerator the Energy Department is planning to constructat a Texas site.   Bryant said he detects an anti-Texas undercurrent in Congress.   ``The kind of budgetary pressure we're experiencing isunprecedented and there is not a lot of good will right now towardour state,'' he said.   Bryant said Texas is being blamed for the planned bailout of thetroubled savings and loan industry at an estimated cost of morethan $100 billion.   Grumbling is also heard over an austerity plan to close militarybases across the country but which leaves all Texas installationsintact except the Navy's homeport at Galveston, which is underconstruction.   Texas also would gain from the possible construction of a spacestation, and members of its congressional delegation aretraditionally at the front of efforts to fund the space budget,Bryant said.   ``There is a general perception, with a president, speaker andall of these Cabinet members (from Texas) and all of our(congressional) chairmen, that we have too many things going ourway,'' Bryant said. ``And we have to overcome that perception.''   Bryant said Gramm's opposition to home-state projects of otherlawmakers has caused a measure of consternation in the Senate.   ``Gramm attacks every proposal here regarding spending, eventhose that were worthy proposals, and he's not receiving a veryfavorable reception from other senators when he goes and asks forhis project,'' Bryant said.   Gramm recently told the Senate a coal purchase proposed by Sen.John Heinz, R-Pa., was ``felony theft of the taxpayers' money,perpetrated by special interest groups who have spokesmen righthere on this floor.'' He called the Weed Science and TechnologyCenter at North Dakota State University a pork barrel project thatcould bust the budget.   Not surprisingly, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., replied by telling arecent hearing that the super collider was not high on his list ofpriorities.   ``Here you are,'' Conrad told Gramm, ``one of the foremostadvocates of being tough on spending, in here advocating a spendingproject that would benefit your constituents.''   ``He (Gramm) was against North Dakota getting a thing, and nowhe's in here wanting it all for Texas,'' said Sen. Wendell Ford,D-Ky.   Gramm spokesman Larry Neal said Gramm stands by his criticism ofHeinz and the North Dakota weed project.   ``The weed research institute was a budget buster,'' Neal said.</TEXT></DOC>
