Because of the price war that has gripped theproperty/casualty industry for nearly four years now,premiums grew just 3.8% in the first half to $105.3 billion.However, underwriting losses jumped 29% to $10.6 billion from$8.2 billion in the 1989 first half.</LP><TEXT>   Pretax operating profit fell 23% to $5.1 billion from $6.7billion a year earlier.   Sean Mooney, an economist with the Insurance InformationInstitute, said the financial results for theproperty/casualty insurers deserve a &quot;C-minus&quot; because ofdecreasing after-tax profits and relatively low rate ofreturn. &quot;The industry continues to muddle along, with noclear sign of a financial upturn.&quot;   He said the second-quarter results were pretty telling,when net fell 3.6% to $2.7 billion for the industry. Relativeto premiums, after-tax earnings in the second quarter stoodat 5.1%. That means that for every premium dollar, theindustry's profit was five cents. Mr. Mooney noted that suchresults were lower than the profit margin for most industriesof seven cents on the sales dollar.   The industry data, compiled by the Insurance ServicesOffice and the National Association of Independent Insurers,includes results for 96% of the property/casualty companiesin the country.</TEXT></DOC>
