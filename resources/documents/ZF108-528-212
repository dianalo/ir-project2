 Management atNorex Leasing Inc (Burlington, Ontario, Canada) mandated use ofchange control for software modules stored with CA-Librarian.andO;Auditors, development project leaders, and systems programmers atKaybee Toy Stores (Pittsfield, MA) worked with personnel fromLegent Corp's (Vienna, VA) Business Software Technology (BST)division to implement BST's Endevor change control package in thechangeover of 8,500 software modules.andP;  HCA Information ServicesInc's (Nashville, TN) use of Pansophic Systems Inc's (Lisle, IL)Panapt change management package is also discussed.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Management of EDPPlanningSoftware ModificationCase StudyApplications Programming.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Change Front BrewingandM;IBM must include a change management component within its AD/Cycle Casesoftware blueprint, declared Honda Bhyat, assistant vice president of systemssoftware at Norex Leasing Inc., Burlington, Ontario.andM;&quot;Change control is the link between AD/Cycle and data center automation,&quot;Bhyat said.andP;  &quot;I'd like to see a converging of AD/Cycle methods with currentlibrary management systems.andP;  Today, it is a long way off and not welldefined.&quot;andM;Bhyat said that IBM's current change management offering is SoftwareConfiguration Library Manager.andM;During the recent Association for Computer Operations Management (Afcom)conference in Washington, users relayed various ways to team softwaredevelopers and systems programmers in the use of change management packages.andM;The practice of developers at Norex, which uses CA-Librarian for storingsource code, had been simply to copy from production any module to be tested,Bhyat said.andP;  Once Norex committed to implementing change control, thispractice became a bad habit because the module needed to be &quot;checked out&quot;from and back into production via a change control system.andM;&quot;Programmers like to take the simplest way out.andP;  To get people to use thechange control system was a political issue,&quot; Bhyat said.andM;Norex management, however, made it clear that developers must use the changemanagement module.andM;&quot;It took them about a week to adjust,&quot; Bhyat said.andP;  Later, developers saw abenefit in obtaining a history of the development work done on each module,how long the work took and how often the module was used.andM;Kaybee Toy Stores, Pittsfield, Mass., uses Endevor from the Business SoftwareTechnology division of Legent Corp., vienna, Va.andM;&quot;With our auditor's support and in conjunction with BST, we put together animplementation plan in six weeks,&quot; said David Lichtel, director of datacenter services for Kaybee.andP;  Development project leaders and systemsprogrammers were both involved in the process.andM;The work included definitios of systems, subsystems, processes, partitiondata sets, instructions for Cobol compiling and debugging.andP;  A total of 8,500&quot;pieces of inventory&quot; or software modules were affected by the changeover,which was all done at one time.andM;&quot;One problem is that development will not stop for five minutes to let you dosomething to help them,&quot; Lichtel said.andP;  &quot;So we worked up to the big bang,threw the switch and lived with the aggravation.&quot;andM;HCA Information Services, Inc., Nashville, Tenn., uses the Panapt changemanagement package from Pansophic Systems Inc., Lisle, Ill.andM;&quot;We were under the gun from audit to get a product in, said Shaun O'Reilly,director of computer operations at the firm.andM;A team including O'Reilly, quality assurance, systems and applicationproduction control personnel implemented the system over a two-year period.andO;&quot;Determining new naming conventions took a lot of the time,&quot; she said.andM;The work had a positive impact on quality, O'Reilly said.andP;  &quot;Developers nowcannot move a module into production until the documentation is there; QAwon't take it.andP;  This has really helped clean up the developers' act.&quot;andM;Bhyat said his firm's tools allow a manager to see how many times a developerhad a completed module rejected by quality assurancE.andP;  &quot;We can identify badprogrammers who don't get it right the first time,&quot; he said.andM;Blue Cross and Blue Shield of St. Louis decided in late 1986 to internallydevelop a change management solution.andM;Craig Besand, supervisor of change management, said production control hadalways handled the change management, but the firm had difficulty matchingthe production and source code.andP;  The firm decided to use a systems programmerand an applications programmer to create the new system, which Besand saidwas fully implemented in 18 months.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
