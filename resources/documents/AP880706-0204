Steven Seelig, associate director of the FDIC's division ofliquidation, said a plan approved by the FDIC board in February topublicly offer the loans from Continental Illinois Corp. in sixlarge portfolios failed, but he said efforts would beginimmediately to sell the loans in smaller packages.   In the unprecedented bailout, the FDIC in 1984 pumped $4.5billion _ $3.5 billion of it borrowed from the Federal ReserveSystem _ into the Chicago-based bank to prevent the failure of whatwas then the nation's seventh-largest bank.   As part of the rescue, the FDIC, which insures accounts incommercial banks up to $100,000, took over many of ContinentalIllinois' problem loans and acquired ownership of the bank's stock.It expects to recoup all but $1.7 billion of the bailout money byselling the loans and the stock.   Seelig told the FDIC board that the agency staff attempted tosell the last of the non-performing loans, originally worth $865million, for a minimum of $299 million.   Despite 274 expressions of interest, Seelig said, the FDIC foundonly 17 bidders financially qualified to buy the loans. Only fiveof those actually submitted bids, all of which were too low.   ``The market for large, complex, troubled credit is thin andrequires sophisticated buyers,'' he said.   Some of the potential buyers were looking to make a quick profitby buying the loans cheap and immediately reselling them, ratherthan holding the loans and working on collections, Seelig said.   However, he said the five-month effort to market the loans inlarge groups turned up investors who could buy smaller batches atthe FDIC's asking price.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, noting a September 1989deadline for repayment of the Federal Reserve's $3.5 billion loan,said, ``I hope you can move ahead with all deliberate speed.''</TEXT></DOC>
