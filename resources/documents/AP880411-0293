The new Open Look feature of Unix software will allow users tomanipulate the computer with graphic symbols instead of writtencommands, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. said.   The changes represent another step toward acceptance of Unix inthe business world. Until recently, Unix was seen as mainly forscience and engineering.   Open Look was designed for ATandamp;T by Sun Microsystems Inc., theburgeoning maker of engineering workstations based in MountainView, Calif.   Sun's design is based on original work, contributions from ATandamp;Tand technology licensed from Xerox Corp., which originated many ofthe ideas for graphic screen symbols, the companies said.   The Open Look screen somewhat resembles that of Apple ComputerInc.'s Macintosh. Apple, famed for the ease of use of itscomputers, has been fighting to protect its turf and recently suedMicrosoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. over a software copyrightissue.   Apple spokeswoman Brooke Cohan said the company had no commenton the ATandamp;T announcement.   Unix is a base layer of software in a computer that serves as atraffic cop for its internal operations. Open Look is a ``userinterface,'' which determines the look and feel of a computer tosomeone sitting at the keyboard.   A wide range of companies endorsed Open Look, including softwaremakers such as Lotus Development Corp., Ashton-Tate Corp. andOracle Corp.; computer makers such as Unisys Corp., Amdahl Corp.and NCR Corp., and chip makers such as Motorola Inc. and NationalSemiconductor Corp.   ATandamp;T will circulate specifications of Open Look for commentstarting this summer and will make the available in the year'sthird quarter. Software that is written to use Open Look will beavailable mainly in 1989 and after.</TEXT></DOC>
