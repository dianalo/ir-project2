Tokyo shares were moderately lower in light trading. Stocks rose in Hong Kong but were lower in almost all other Asian and European markets.    London's Financial Times 30-share index was down 23 at 1835.2. The 100-share index fell 28 to 2338.5. Volume was 406.8 million shares, compared with 762.3 million Friday.    News of lower-than-expected earnings at Glaxo Holdings, Britain's biggest pharmaceutical company, compounded the effects of Wall Street's decline and interest-rate fears, dealers said. Pretax profit rose 21% to #746 million ($1.23 billion) in the year ended June 30, but that was short of most analysts' forecasts. Glaxo fell 171 to 1,529 pence ($25.30) a share.    These concerns overshadowed some relatively favorable economic data, dealers said. Raw materials prices rose 0.1% in September from August, slowing from August's 0.6% rise.    Midland Bank rose 2 to 551. Prudential said it holds a 2% stake in Midland for investment purposes. Prudential, trading ex-dividend, fell 26 to 1,125.    Lloyds Bank was down 4 at 354, Barclays Bank was off 3 at 620, and National Westminster Bank fell 9 to 758.    TSB Group rose 3 to 148 on reports it will sell brokerage Wood Mackenzie, a unit of Hill Samuel Group, for as much as #60 million. TSB made an agreed offer for Hill Samuel valued at #777 million Oct. 2.    Tokyo's Nikkei average of 225 stocks, which set records the previous two sessions, dropped 54.12 to 26284.65. The Tokyo Stock Exchange first section index fell 2.08 to 2156.17. Volume was about 600 million shares, compared with 1.6 billion Friday. The Tokyo market was closed Saturday.    &quot;There was a strong wait-and-see mood in the market,&quot; one trader said, with many investors waiting for tomorrow's U.S. trade report for August. Others said the market was taking a breather after setting records Thursday and Friday.    The market also was troubled by anticipation of a rise in Japan's discount rate, traders said. The Bank of Japan is widely believed to be considering a base-rate increase from the present 2.5% to try to contain inflation.    Export-sensitive electrical and precision-instrument stocks were lower, with Sony down 90 to 5,410 yen ($37.68) a share and TDK off 40 to 5,360. Traders cited expectations that the Japanese yen might rise against the dollar after the U.S. trade data are released.    Canon fell 50 to 1,330, and Ricoh was down 10 to 1,440. Olympus Optical ended unchanged at 1,200.    Pharmaceutical, construction and auto makers' shares generally lost ground, while steel and heavy machinery issues climbed. Traders said their gains showed that the market is beginning to adjust for the expected discount-rate increase, as higher interest rates normally send those issues down.    Frankfurt share prices closed mixed as investors began to reassess the Bonn government's plans to impose a 10% withholding tax on capital investment income.    Some blue-chip shares made recoveries as traders covered short positions taken after word of the plan leaked out Friday. The tax package announced over the weekend wouldn't affect income from stock dividends or long-term capital gains.    Although bond markets continued to slide, stock investors were paying more attention to the steadiness of the West German mark against the dollar and had already discounted an increase in interest rates, a broker said.    Among auto makers, Daimler-Benz jumped 28 to 1,024 marks ($566.06) a share, Volkswagen gained 7.20 to 361.20, and Bayerische Motoren Werke rose 5 to 717.    Banks, which fear the tax bill could cause investors to drain savings accounts, continued to fall. Deutsche Bank was off 5.50 to 661.50, Commerzbank slipped 4.50 to 286, and Dresdner Bank eased 3 to 345.    Some chemical makers advanced, with Hoechst up 3.30 to 322.90. Bayer gained 1.80 to 363.80, but BASF eased 0.30 to 332.40.    Australian share prices resumed their decline after having steadied a bit Friday. Wall Street's weakness and rising U.S. interest rates were major factors. Australian interest rates also edged up, and a sluggish bullion market hampered mining stocks.    Broken Hill Proprietary went against the trend, firming 0.05 to 10.30 Australian dollars ($7.47) a share. Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Resources, which owns 28% of BHP, fell 0.26 to 4.96.    Publisher John Fairfax added 0.04 to 8.34. Warwick Fairfax has made a takeover bid of 8.50 dollars a share.    Among miners, CRA fell 0.10 to 10.65, Western Mining shed 0.24 to 8.30, and North Broken Hill Holdings fell 0.30 to 4.20.    Hong Kong shares rose in active trading, boosted by continued rumors that Japanese investors were buying a large stake in Hongkong Land.    Singapore stocks drifted lower in light, nervous trading. Some brokers said social and political uncertainty in Malaysia caused selling of Malaysian shares on the Singapore market.    Stocks also fell in Stockholm, Amsterdam, Brussels, Zurich and Paris, mostly on concerns about a weaker dollar and higher U.S. interest rates. Milan shares were mixed.    Stockholm shares had their biggest one-day decline since late August, as higher interest rates, Wall Street's dive Friday and approaching expiration dates on options contracts triggered a round of profit-taking. In Brussels, shares were hit by fears that the Belgian government may again be about to fall over the long-standing dispute between French-speaking and Flemish-speaking factions.
