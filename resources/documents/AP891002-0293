Franklin Williams</BYLINE><DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than half of all cancers occur inpeople 65 and older, but many people mistakenly assume that oncethey reach retirement age they are powerless to prevent the disease_ that it's just too late to try.   Age is one of the greatest risk factors for developing cancer.At 25, the chance of being diagnosed with cancer within five yearsis one in 700; at 65 it is one in 14. However, scientists areconvinced we can improve those odds.   It's never too late to prevent cancer. Here's how.   Stop smoking. Cigarette smoking causes 85 percent of lungcancers in men and 75 percent in women. Smokers also are morelikely to develop cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, pancreasand bladder. Once you quit _ no matter what your age _ your risk ofcancer begins to decline right away.   Eat a variety of good foods. Researchers have found that ahigh-fat diet increases the risk of breast, colon and prostatecancers, which are common in older people; a well-balanced dietreduces the risk. In particular, eat more high-fiber foods(whole-grain cereals, fruits and vegetables) and fewer fatty foods(butter, cream and high-fat cheese). It's not as hard as it sounds.You don't have to give up all of the foods you like; eat more ofthe foods that reduce your risk of cancer and less of those thatincrease it.   Drink alcohol only in moderation. Cancers of the mouth, throat,esophagus and liver occur more often among heavy drinkers ofalcohol.   Avoid too much sun. Almost all skin cancers are caused byexposure to the sun. Repeated exposure is especially dangerous forpeople with fair skin and those who freckle easily. The sun isstrongest from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunscreen lotions and protectiveclothing, like a hat or long-sleeved shirt, can help.   Use hormones carefully. Estrogen has been associated withhigher-than-average rates of uterine cancer. Women who take it torelieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause should discussthe benefits and risks with their doctor.   In addition to changing your lifestyle, enlist your doctor. Thechances of surviving cancer are greatest with early detection andprompt treatment.   Even before symptoms appear, doctors can detect cancers of thebreast, colon, prostate and cervix. As part of your regularcheckup, your doctor may recommend a number of tests to look forthese and other forms of cancer.   For example, all women should have their breasts examinedregularly by a doctor, and should learn how to perform monthlybreast self-examination. After menopause, women should examinetheir breasts the same day each month. An X-ray of the breast(mammogram) can detect a cancer too small to be felt. Beginning at50, women should have a mammogram each year or as recommended by adoctor.   Men and women over 40 should have a digital rectal exam on aninitial visit to a primary care doctor and at least every threeyears after that. This is the most reliable test for prostatecancer in men; it also can detect cancer of the rectum in men andwomen.   The stool blood test for rectal and colon cancers is recommendedyearly after age 50. In addition, most cancer specialists recommendsigmoidoscopy, an examination of the colon and rectum with a thin,hollow, lighted instrument which can detect cancer and noncancerousgrowths. This exam is recommended at least once after age 50 andthen every three to five years after two negative exams a yearapart.   Most cases of cervical cancer could be prevented if every womanhad a Pap test and pelvic exam regularly. The Pap test detectscancerous cells in and around the cervix. After women have normaltest results three years in a row, their doctors may suggest theyhave a Pap test less often.   Many people automatically attribute aches and pains to growingolder. They may ignore their symptoms, assuming they are anunavoidable part of aging. Most symptoms are not serious, but onlya doctor can tell for sure. To be safe, tell your doctor about anyunusual symptoms that last two weeks or more.   Cancer frightens everyone. But many older people are reluctantto discuss it with their families or doctors because they believe anumber of myths about the disease and its treatment. When they grewup, nothing could stop cancer's deadly progress. Even the word waswhispered behind the patient's back.   Today, however, many cancers can be treated successfully iffound early. Even better news is that the chances of surviving aregreater than ever. The best news of all is that many cancers caneven be prevented.
