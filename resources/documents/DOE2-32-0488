<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-32-0488 </DOCNO><TEXT>Process of diffractive production of 3PI-system was studied in the frameworkof Deek model, including 3PI-resonances. Satisfactory description ofgeneral distributions in coherent PI/sup -/A-andgt;PI/sup -/PI/sup +/PI/sup-/A reaction was obtained. 3PI-resonances A/sub 1/(1/sup +/) and PI/sup'/,PI/sup ''/(0/sup -/) were included into the model for describing dataof partial-wave analysis. Satisfactory description of intensities of1/sup +/S and 0/sup -/S basic waves and basic phase differences in PI/sup-/A-andgt;PI/sup -/PI/sup +/PI/sup -/A reaction (on Si nucleus) and relativephases in similar reaction on nucleon target was obtained. The true Deckcontributuion to intensities of 1/sup +/S and 0/sup -/S basic waves dominateson an average in obtained results. 16 refs.; 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
