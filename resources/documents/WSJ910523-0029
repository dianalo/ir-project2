Despite the gain in indexes, 798 Big Board issuesdeclined and 766 rose.   With the market stuck in a trading range, investors andespecially traders are switching around sectors, trying tofind a group that will have positive earnings surprises.   Yesterday, technology shares, which have been slumpinglately, rose across the board. Analysts said meetings withAdvanced Micro Devices and Hewlett-Packard yesterday, andIntel earlier this week, were upbeat, helping to lift theentire group.   Advanced Micro Devices rose 1 to 13; Hewlett-Packardgained 1 1/2 to 49 1/2; and Intel rose 1 1/2 to 48 1/2 onNasdaq. International Business Machines rose 3 1/8 to 104 5/8on 2.2 million shares; Digital Equipment Corp. gained 7/8 to63 1/4.   Kidder Peabody analyst David Korus advised clients to buyIBM yesterday, even though he cut his 1991 estimate to $6.90a share from the $8 a share he had forecast earlier. Mr.Korus said the stock is still a good value and will probablyoutperform other computer shares.   Said Arnold Owen, vice president of trading at SoundviewFinancial Group: &quot;Over the last several weeks, we've watchedthe market trade in a 100-point range, except for technologystocks, which suffered a real correction.&quot; He saidinstitutional investors, as well as more speculative traders,returned to the stocks yesterday, figuring most of thedeclines were over.   Still, other analysts remain cautious on the group.   Russell Crabs, director of research at Soundview,maintains a &quot;hold&quot; rating on Hewlett-Packard, for example.&quot;We won't change that until we see a change in generaldemand&quot; for computing products, he says. He adds that overallorder growth at Hewlett-Packard declined in the fiscal secondquarter, even though per-share earnings were up 20%. Expensecontrols helped increase profits, he says.   &quot;When the capital spending cycle turns, Hewlett willbenefit more than Digital or IBM because they have expensesunder control and strong, new products in the pipeline,&quot; headds. Trouble is, say many computer industry executives andanalysts, the economy might not bounce back on cue in thesecond or third quarter, as expected. Soundview maintains a&quot;hold&quot; rating on Digital Equipment and IBM.

Mitch Meisler, executive vice president of world-wideequity trading at Lehman Brothers, says that the market isbound to move higher with a friendly Federal Reserve intenton leading the economy out of the recession.   &quot;We might stay in a trading range for a while, but thelonger-term trend is to the upside,&quot; he says. The questionremaining, adds Mr. Meisler, is how long will the recessionlast.
