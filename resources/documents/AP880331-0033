TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Violent protests have persisted despite an armyban on free news media access to the West Bank and Gaza Strip,challenging Israeli contentions that television cameras fueledPalestinian riots.   The measures against the media have been unprecedented inIsrael's 20-year occupation of the territories.   Reporters and photographers have been barred for at least threedays and possibly longer from entering the areas where 1.5 millionPalestinians live alongside 65,000 Jewish settlers.   The only access is with Israeli army escorts, a procedure thatprevents journalists from talking freely with Palestinians.   Authorities also have sought to cut off major sources ofinformation such as the Arab-run Palestine Press Service. The newsagency offices were padlocked by police on Wednesday.   Neither measure has been entirely effective. The Gaza Strip hasremained sealed, because of its geographic isolation and becausetelephone lines have been cut.   But reporters have circumvented roadblocks in the West Bank byusing back roads, traveling with Jewish settlers or identifyingthemselves as tourists.   And Palestinian journalists have continued to keep the foreignnews media informed of breaking developments via telephone calls.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has argued that the mediarestrictions coupled with preventative arrests, economic sanctionsand other measures will eventually have a calming effect.   ``The cumulative effect of the measures ... will join to form asystem that will bring calm,'' he said on Israel radio.   Reflecting official thinking, Arieh Shalev, who headed Israel'smilitary government in the West Bank from 1974 to 1976, said in aninterview that news coverage was a key to the Palestinian uprising.   ``One of the most important elements of the uprising is to wininternational sympathy and cause damage to Israel in the hope thatthis will have political effect, as well,'' said Shalev, now of TelAviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.   ``The restriction of the media is aimed at harming theircampaign for world public opinion. This is a step Israel is takingto weaken the Palestinians, not to get at the journalists.''   More than 120 Palestinians have been killed since violence beganDec. 8. One Israeli soldier has been killed. Israel's use ofbullets to quell the riots prompted international criticism, as didthe policy of beating protesters.   Liberal critics of the media restrictions, who were decidedly inthe minority, argued that Israel was sacrificing democraticprinciples.   Ido Dissentchik, editor of the mass circulation Maariv daily,said in an interview the closure was a ``heavy price to pay.''   ``I think it's an hysterical step. I hope that it doesn'tindicate that people in authority are losing their heads,'' saidDissentchik. ``Israeli authorities must live with this problemcalled democracy.''   There has been a solid consensus among ordinary Israelis thatthe riots were feeding off media coverage and that it would befoolish and self-destructive to allow it to continue.   The psychological basis for the decision to close off the areas,at least in part, involves a unique Israeli sensitivity about beinga victim.   One of the worst insults in Israel is to be called a ``fryar,''Hebrew slang for patsy, a person who lets other people takeadvantage of him.   Many Israelis feel they are becoming just that: victims of theirown openness and democratic traditions.   Officials also argue Israel has been subjected to a doublestandard by the foreign news media, and that no Arab state wouldhave used the restraint Israel has shown.   ``When Arabs kill Arabs it's not news,'' said one official whospoke on condition of anonymity.   Officials also complained the media gave prominence to thebloodshed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip but ignored loss of lifeelsewhere in the world.   One cited what he described as relatively fleeting coverage ofIraq's alleged use of chemical weapons on Iranian-occupied Kurdishvillages in which Iran claimed 5,000 people were killed.   Another pointed to a newspaper that gave front-page play to theshooting death of a Palestinian woman but carried deep inside thepaper the story of hundreds of people reportedly massacred inBrazil.   ``If this is the double standard the world is going to adopt,then we can do without them,'' said the official.   Officials also alleged anti-Israeli and even anti-Semitic bias.They showed a reporter newspaper stories or cartoons equatingIsraeli measures against Palestinians with those used against Jewsby Nazi Germany or which used Jewish symbols such as Stars of Davidor menorah candelabras.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Nicolas B.
