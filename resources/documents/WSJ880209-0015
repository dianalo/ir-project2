The ratings concern cited weaker-than-anticipated recent operating performance and expectations of extended weak profitability. It also cited increased debt levels, which were about 30% of capitalization Dec. 31. Moody's said it is also concerned about the Dallas-based concern's exposure in the Southwest's battered real-estate markets. David W. Quinn, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Centex, said the company believes that its debt level is &quot;comfortable&quot; and that it will decline over the next couple of years. He noted that Centex's exposure in the Southwest has dropped dramatically, with it now doing about 20% of its business in Texas, compared with about 70% in 1979. </TEXT></DOC>
