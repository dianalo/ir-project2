(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A wildcat strike that has idledthousands of West Virginia coal miners spread in Virginia onWednesday as United Mine Workers members ignored a federal judge'sback-to-work orders, company officials said.   State police reported minor violence at mines in Boone andRaleigh counties but no arrests as roving bands of pickets continuedto shut down mines.   About 650 Westmoreland Coal Co. employees at three mines inwestern Virginia near the Kentucky line joined a walkout that beganMonday in southern West Virginia.   It was the first major expansion of the miners' show of supportfor 1,600 union members striking in West Virginia and Virginiaagainst The Pittston Coal Group.   Westmoreland spokesman Steve Anderson said about 50 Virginiaminers at three small mines staged a walkout Tuesday but were backto work Wednesday. The miners who went on strike Wednesday had beenat work a day earlier, he said.   ``We're trying to determine what we can do and want to do andwhat the issues are,'' Anderson said.   He said the company filed complaints with the National LaborRelations Board in Cincinnati and Winston-Salem, N.C., accusing theunion of committing an unfair labor practice.   In West Virginia, more than a dozen mines whose operators hadobtained back-to-work orders from U.S. District Judge Dennis Knappwere among those affected by walkouts.   ``As of today, they have not gone back to work,'' said NoelJones, Island Creek Coal Co.'s director of administrative services.He said 197 Island Creek employees were off the job in West Virginia.   ``Everything's the same as it was yesterday,'' Consolidation CoalCo. spokesman Paul Kvederis said. About 250 Consolidation workers atthe Rowland mine in Raleigh County have ignored a back-to-work orderKnapp issued Monday.   Altogether, company officials Tuesday had estimated that 10,000workers were absent.   Knapp on Wednesday issued more back-to-work orders, applying toHobet Coal Co. in Boone County, Kanawha Mining Co. in Kanawha andFayette counties, Kelso Coal Co. in Boone County, and High PowerEnergy's strip mine in Nicholas County.   In Charleston-based UMW District 17, where the walkout began, 90percent of Logan County's 400 mines were idled, state EnergyDepartment spokeswoman Twila Matheny said Wednesday. In District17's Region 6, centered in Kanawha County, 35 of 42 mines were shutdown, she said.   State police reported windows broken at a Westmoreland mine inBoone County and at New Beckley Mining Co. in Raleigh County.   ``Of course, there was some rock throwing. There also was someindication there was some gunfire directed at the fans of themine,'' said state police Capt. A.E. Baumgardner. ``They dispersedafter they were asked to unhood.''   Some striking workers said they will remain off the job untilthree union officials are released from the Roanoke, Va., jail,where they are being held for violating a judge's order limitingpicket-line activity at Pittston mines.   Union officials did not return phone calls Tuesday or Wednesday,but they have said they did not authorize the walkouts, whichviolate a no-strike clause in the union's 1988 national contractwith the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.   Pittston, the nation's largest coal exporter, negotiatedindependently with the union, and talks broke down over work rulesthe company says it needs to compete with foreign suppliers.</TEXT></DOC>
