The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries gathered in late morning but postponed an earlyevening meeting to give them more time to come up with a new accord.   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto announced the delay, saying ``newthinking (was) being developed.'' Shortly before then, an Iraniandelegate said his country had offered a new plan for raising theproduction ceiling in the final quarter of the year.   The ministers were arguing over whether they can boostproduction from their current limit of 19.5 million barrels a dayin the final quarter, without upsetting prices.   ``It seems (there will be) a little increase,'' said a seniormember of one delegation, who demanded anonymity.   ``But we still have different positions,'' he said. ``It's aslow process.''   ``We have to argue a little,'' said Kuwait's Ali Khalifaal-Sabah after the two-hour meeting. ``Otherwise, it wouldn't beOPEC.''   The ministers seemed determined to try to rescue the talks,which were on the verge of collapse Monday evening.   ``We have come back from the edge of the precipice,'' said asenior delegate midway through the two-hour long morning meeting.He also demanded anonymity.   The ministers were reported close to a deal Monday on raisingthe production ceiling, but then hit some snags forcing them topostpone formal discussions.   Their negotiations _ most taking place in their rooms at aluxury Geneva hotel _ have centered on a lifting the ceilingbetween 20 million barrels a day and 21 million barrels, accordingto delegates.   They also must decide how to distribute any increase among the13 member nations. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates want biggershares than now allotted them. Others argue the extra amount shouldbe shared proportionately.   Late Monday evening, Subroto said, ``We think that (Tuesday)could be our last look at the routes to take.''   Subroto has predicted demand for the cartel's oil would reach 22million barrels a day in the October-December period.   The cartel's executive body, according to sources, has saidprices could reach $18 even if the cap were lifted to as much as21.5 million barrels a day _ but only if all adhered to theirquotas.   The talks, which began Saturday, are officially held by amonitoring panel made up of Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.   The other members _ Gabon, Ecuador, Libya, Qatar and the UnitedArab Emirates _ were invited to attend.</TEXT></DOC>
