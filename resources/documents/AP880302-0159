In a joint statement Wednesday, leaders of the Western alliancecalled on the Soviet Union and its allies to begin negotiationsaimed at eliminating the East's capability for launching a surpriseattack in Europe.   They said Soviet non-nuclear forces facing NATO are far inexcess of Moscow's needs for self defense and ``cast a shadow overthe whole of Europe.''   President Reagan called the declaration ``a major step forwardfor the alliance.''   The idea is to portray the North Atlantic Treaty Organization asunited in calling for fewer non-nuclear weapons at a time when thealliance members cannot agree how far to go in scrapping atomicarms.   The NATO initiative also shifts the public spotlight away fromWest Germany's dispute within the alliance over whether and when toreplace very short-range nuclear weapons with new, more effectiveones. Most of these weapons, if used, would strike German soil,East or West.   The main NATO theme is that the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact'snumerical superiority in conventional weapons and troops _ not theexistence of nuclear arms in Europe _ is the greatest danger toWestern security.   According to Western estimates, the Warsaw Pact holds about a3-to-1 advantage in tanks and artillery and nearly a 2-to-1 edge incombat aircraft and troops, including reserves in the Soviet Union.Moscow contends that East-West conventional forces are roughlyequivalent.   The stress on conventional arms, NATO hopes, will steal some ofthe momentum from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign towoo the European public with calls for ridding their continent ofall nuclear weapons.   NATO leaders agree that some nuclear arms are needed in Europeto deter attack.   Gorbachev appears to have significantly improved his publicimage in Western Europe by agreeing last year to a longstandingU.S. proposal to eliminate all intermediate-range nuclear weapons,based mostly in Europe.   The 16 NATO nations have strongly endorsed this deal, known asthe INF Treaty. The Senate is expected to ratify the treaty thisspring.   But in the aftermath of the INF deal, the alliance has falleninto disagreement over whether to press immediately for East-Westnegotiations to reduce a large Soviet edge in short-range nuclearmissiles. West Germany, which is most directly threatened by theseweapons, wants such talks to start soon; most of the other NATOallies do not.   The Brussels NATO summit was not expected to discuss thisquandry in detail, much less find a solution. Instead, a key aim ofthe meeting was to turn the public's attention to other aspects ofEast-West relations, including human rights and non-nuclear armstalks.   The NATO members and the seven Warsaw Pact nations have beenworking for a year to agree on the framework for a new set ofnegotiations to establish a more stable balance of conventionalforces in Europe.   These talks, likely to begin this fall, would replace a narrowerset of East-West negotiations on cutting troop levels, which beganin 1973. After 15 years, these talks have not produced a singleagreement.   NATO members hope the new negotiations would focus more directlyon warfighting equipment as well as troops. These talks also wouldencompass the full European area, from the Atlantic to the Uralmountains. The old troop talks were limited to the central front.   Even though the Western allies acknowledge that it may takeyears to reach a meaningful agreement on conventional forces, theyhope the drive to reach the bargaining table will put NATO back onthe diplomatic offensive.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE: Robert Burns covers the North Atlantic Treaty</HEAD><TEXT>   Organization for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
