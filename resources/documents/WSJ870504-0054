For the 21-year-old economics major at Northwestern University, the analogy is more than academic. With most big corporations thinning the ranks of middle management, so many rungs now are missing from the corporate ladder that many students wonder about advancement in future jobs. What's more, many students find that entry-level jobs are neither plentiful nor secure.    Back in the early 1970s, for example, General Motors Corp. recruited between 2,000 and 2,500 students each year. This year, it will hire only about 500. Dow Chemical Co. also is &quot;hiring for a smaller company&quot; following the early retirement last year of 1,200 of its 25,000 employees, says John Billingsley, the director of personnel resources. Jack Shingleton, the placement director at Michigan State, says companies with over 10,000 employees have reduced hiring this year by more than 9%.    &quot;Today's student is much more anxious about the job market and is searching more desperately,&quot; Mr. Shingleton says.    So, university placement officers increasingly try to steer students away from big-name corporations and toward smaller companies. For good reason: Companies with fewer than 1,000 employees are expected to hire 6.7% more people this year than last, according to Mr. Shingleton.    At big companies, students worry that, even if they land an entry-level job, it may not lead anywhere. In new, leaner corporations, &quot;there's no way from the bottom to the top,&quot; Northwestern's Ms. Beller says.    Future security is also a concern. &quot;I want a company that isn't a {potential} takeover target,&quot; says Chandra Stephens, a marketing student at Washington University's business school in St. Louis. &quot;That will give me more stability.&quot;    Eli Ginzberg, professor emeritus of economics at Columbia University, says students are becoming more realistic about their prospects. &quot;No sensible student of mine would join a corporation and assume they were there for life,&quot; he says.    Thus, some students value jobs at big corporations for the training they will get there -- for future careers elsewhere -- in smaller companies or in businesses they start themselves.    &quot;They {want to} get a job, get experience and use it as a steppingstone,&quot; says Craig Notari, a 22-year-old senior at Northwestern who says he is an anomaly among his peers because he intends to make a career at International Business Machines Corp., where he recently accepted a job offer.    &quot;There's much less belief that going in and being a good person and doing a job will provide you with a long-term payoff,&quot; says Howard Stevenson, a professor at Harvard Business School. He cites a survey last year showing that 90% of Harvard Business School students hope to run their own businesses one day. While comparable data for earlier years aren't available, anecdotal evidence indicates that only some 60% had such goals a decade ago.    The trend worries corporations. &quot;The very best students tend to be more willing to leave an employer if that employer isn't providing them with opportunities to fulfill themselves,&quot; says Ralph Frederick, GM's general director of personnel development. </TEXT></DOC>
