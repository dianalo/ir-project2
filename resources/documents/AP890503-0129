JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The amount of radioactive dust released from auranium-processing plant in Ohio may be two to six times greaterthan estimated because of ``inherently deceptive'' record-keeping,a consultant said Wednesday.   The consultant's report was prepared for a lawsuit to be heardnext month against the former operator of the Energy Departmentplant at Fernald, Ohio, where the government says an extensivecleanup effort will be required over the next decade.   The plant, on 1,050 acres 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, hasprocessed uranium for nuclear weapons since 1952 during which thegovernment estimates as much as 552,000 pounds of radioactiveuranium dust may have been released into the air.   But a report released Wednesday by the Institute for Energy andEnvironmental Research said the government estimates are far toolow based on evidence gathered as part of the lawsuit fromdepositions and internal plant documents.   Arjun Makhijani, an engineer and co-author of the report, saidas much as 3.1 million pounds of uranium particles may have beenreleased from the plant since it opened in 1952. Even usingconservative estimates, the releases likely significantly exceedthe government estimates, he suggested.   Chris Sankey, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said thedepartment does not necessarily dispute the group's figures, butwill not agree with them either. She said the department does notwant to discuss the new findings in detail because of the trialscheduled to begin June 5.   Officials of Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, the plant'scurrent operator which officially took over operation in January1986, declined comment on the consultant's report until the companycan get a copy and read it.   The suit alleges that National Lead of Ohio, which had operatedthe plant, created a health hazard and reduced property values nearthe plant because of the release of radioactive particles.   Makhijani said the higher estimates of radioactive releases over37 years of plant operation are based on internal plant documentsand statements by officials and a computer analysis ofradioactivity levels in soil within a five-mile radius of the plant.   ``The official estimates (cited so far by the government) ofcumulative releases of uranium to the air from this plant are basedin part on fabricated data and what plant documents themselvesdescribe as an `inherently deceptive' method of calculating'' someof the releases, wrote Makhijani.   The report cited a court deposition by Michael W. Boback, formerhead of industrial hygiene and radiation at the plant, that stackpollution filters regularly were not examined during long periodsof time, but ``zero loss'' of radioactive particles neverthelesswere entered into release records.   The report said no adequate accounting was made of radioactivereleases from areas not specifically monitored, although internaldocuments show such releases were much greater than estimated bythe government. One memo cites extensive concern about radioactivedust leaking from equipment in areas not officially being monitored.   ``A bucket was placed under the largest leak to help contain thespilled dust'' from one piece of equipment, a memo says.   A spot check showed releases from unmonitored areas in a singlemonth to exceed all releases attributed to such sources by thegovernment over the entire 37-year period, the report said.   The report said releases from stack scrubbers were based on anassumption that they were highly efficient and in good workingcondition, although internal documents show scrubbers in disrepairand corroding.   ``We have long suspected that the stack and scrubber losses fromPlant 8 (one of the buildings at the facility) are far greater thanare reported by the Health and Safety Division,'' said a June 4,1964, plant memo cited in the report. A 1970 memo referred toproblems with another scrubber which, it said, was ``badly corrodedand does not perform required scrubber functions.''   A computer analysis of soil samples within five miles of theplant, conducted as part of the consultant's investigation,indicated levels of radiation on average eight times greater thanwould be expected with the levels of release cited by thegovernment, said Makhijani.</TEXT></DOC>
