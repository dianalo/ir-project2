Human monoclonal antibodies, if they can be developed,probably would replace many of the mouse monoclonalantibodies that currently are the foundation of afast-growing branch of the biotechnology industry. The humanmonoclonal antibodies would be less likely than the existingmouse antibodies to trigger an immune response in humanpatients. Such an immune response often limits the number oftimes a patient can be treated with mouse monoclonalantibodies.</LP><TEXT>   Monoclonal antibodies often are called the &quot;magic bullets&quot;or &quot;`guided missiles&quot; of the medical world. They arelaboratory-made versions of the antibodies that animals andhumans produce to fight off invasions of &quot;foreign&quot; proteinssuch as those on viruses. A breakthrough in the mid-1970s hasspawned a dozen or more companies that either produce or aredeveloping monoclonal antibodies that selectively attack theproteins on cancer or other diseased cells, blood clots,bacteria, viruses, hormones and other biological substances.The antibodies are being used both to treat disease and todiagnose infections or conditions such as pregnancy.   In a report appearing in this week's issue of Science,researchers at Schering-Plough's Laboratory for ImmunologicalResearch in France say they've figured out how to culture orgrow human antibody-producing cells in the test tube. Theseare white blood cells known as B cells. Until now, scientistshave been able to culture human B cells in the test tube onlyif the cells have been transformed by a virus into cancercells. The human B cells being grown in France are completelynormal.   The French researchers have kept cultures of normal humanB cells going for as long as two months, said Allan Waitz,head of Dnax Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif., theSchering-Plough subsidiary that oversees the Frenchlaboratory.   The French development is a major advance &quot;although we'resome distance from producing human monoclonals,&quot; Mr. Waitzsaid.   The head of a major antibody manufacturer, Centocor Inc.in Malvern, Pa., agreed. The ability to culture human B cells&quot;obviously is a very significant contribution although Iwould say it adds more to the basic research effort than tomethods of producing monoclonals,&quot; Hubert Shoemaker, chairmanand chief executive officer of Centocor, said.   Both executives explained that the advance may helpovercome a major roadblock to human monoclonal antibodies. Tomake monoclonal antibodies, biologists have to undertakeprocedures that are permissible in mice but not in humans.They first have to infect the animal with the protein thatwill be the target of the antibodies. Once the animal hasbegun developing antibodies against the protein, its spleenis removed and the antibody-producing B cells removed. TheseB-cells are then fused with mouse cancer cells to create aclone or clump of identical cells that proliferateindefinitely in the test tube and churn out flasks full ofantibodies that attack the original target protein.   Scientists can similarly produce human monoclonalantibodies but only if they can obtain B cells from a humanwho happens to be making antibodies against a desired targetprotein. The B cells making the desired antibodies can befused with human cancer cells to create the long-livedtest-tube clones that produce the antibodies. Centocor, forinstance, is currently awaiting federal clearance to marketsuch a human monoclonal that attacks and neutralizes abacterial toxin that causes blood poisoning.   The rub is that the researchers can't go around infectinghumans with target proteins in order to get the B cells thatmake a desired antibody, Centocor's Mr. Shoemaker explained.   The Schering-Plough advance may solve this problem,according to Messrs. Waitz and Shoemaker. The next step, theysaid, is for the scientists to learn how to infect thelaboratory-grown human B cells with target proteins so thatthey'll churn out antibodies to the proteins.   Schering-Plough isn't currently in the monoclonal antibodybusiness but is applying for patents on the advance, Mr.Waitz said. If granted, the patents would give the companyunusual protection in the monoclonal antibody field since themethods of culturing mouse B cells in the test tube aren'tcovered by patents, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
