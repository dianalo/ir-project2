Gen. Gordon Sullivan, the Army's chief of staff whodisclosed the plan to reporters yesterday, acknowledged thatmuch of the equipment is either too old or just plainunnecessary to remain in Defense Department warehouses inEurope. &quot;I'm trying to get rid of a lot of World War IIIstocks, trucks and so forth,&quot; Gen. Sullivan said. He declinedto provide specifics about the size or timing of anticipatedsales.</LP><TEXT>   The immediate purpose is to raise money to help buy newequipment, but the long-term goal appears to be to try tostave off even deeper personnel reductions by convincingCongress that the Army is exploring every potential path tosave money. Lawmakers have talked about saving billions ofdollars annually by reducing inventories of spare parts andeveryday items consumed by the military. Many Pentagoncritics contend, however, that such steps merely delaynecessary, but painful, decision-making to force additionaluniformed personnel off the payroll.</TEXT></DOC>
