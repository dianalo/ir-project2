Police in Lebanon the six included Israeli troops and alliedLebanese militiamen. In Jerusalem, an Israeli army official said thevictims included two Israeli soldiers and four Lebanese civilians.   The conflicting reports could not immediately be reconciled.   The police said the explosion occurred along the mainKawkaba-Marjayoun road in the southern Lebanese town of Marjayoun,about six miles north of the security zone. The region is patrolledby Norwegian soldiers working in the United Nations peacekeepingforce.   The Israeli official said one of the civilians was seriouslywounded and was flown to Rambam Hospital in the northern Israelicity of Haifa.   In Beirut, the pro-Iranian Siite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party ofGod, claimed responsibility for the roadside bomb. The group saidfour Israeli helicopter gunships evacuated the casualties and thatfires were blazing in the area.   ``An Islamic resistance squad carried out a courageous operationagainst the Israeli enemy in the Marjeyoun area,'' a Hezbollahstatement said.   The Islamic resistance, a coalition of Iranian-backed groups, hasbeen involved in guerrilla warfare in the security zone, which has apredominantly Shiite Moslem population.   U.N. peacekeeping troops and Israeli soldiers were put on alertand a joint Israeli-SLA force immediately blanketed the area withmachine gun fire, said a police spokesman who cannot be identifiedunder standing rules.   Tension has been running high between Israeli troops andpeacekeepers serving with the U.N. Interim Force in south Lebanon.   On Thursday, Israeli troops beat up four U.N. peacekeepers neartheir headquarters in the Lebanese border town of Naqoura, accordingto security sources in south Lebanon.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said sixIsraeli troops went into a restaurant on the main road to Naqoura,where they harassed and slapped one Irish and three Swedish soldiersbefore confiscating their cameras and films.   The Israeli troops accused the four U.N. soldiers of takingpictures of an Israeli-made Merkava tank they were aboard beforeentering the restaurant, the sources said.   On Tuesday, Israeli troops drove a tank into a group of UNIFILvehicles after the peacekeepers detained an Israeli military convoyat a checkpoint in south Lebanon. No U.N. soldiers were injured,although several vehicles were damaged, according to U.N. sources.   The security zone is a six- to 10-mile wide buffer retained byIsrael after it withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in1985, ending a three-year occupation.
