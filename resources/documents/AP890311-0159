Just as retail hypermarkets offer everything from groceries togarbage cans under one roof, a Time Warner conglomerate could createa one-stop market for books, films, magazines, records and cabletelevision.   In theory at least, the deal would enable an advertiser in Peopleor Sports Illustrated magazines to get his product placed in aWarner Bros. film or in a syndicated Lorimar program like ``Alf''and then buy commercial time on the movie videocassette or on thenew company's huge cable outlets.   An author published in hard-cover by a Time book company may beoffered a deal that includes selling paperback, film and musicrights to Warner and the television rights to Warner's Lorimar unit.   Any movie or TV programs that result from the book could thendebut on Time's Home Box Office or Cinemax cable networks.   But media and marketing analysts warn that what sounds workablein theory may not be so easy in practice. They said the magazine,records, film, cable, book and television syndication operations forTime and Warner have operated fairly independently over the yearsand won't likely cooperate without firm signals from top corporatemanagement that they do so.   ``Some of the things that strike one as obvious are notprobable,'' said J. Kendrick Noble, media analyst for PaineWebber.   He noted that Time has offered a package deal of discounts foradvertisers in its magazines, but never extended it to time on its82 percent-owned cable system, American Television andCommunications Corp.   And he said established authors generally can make more moneyselling rights to their work in different media separately ratherthan in a package.   More likely, Noble said, is that Time's expertise in directmarketing could be used effectively to sell Warner's videocassettesand records.   David Fulton, media director for the advertising agency FCB-LeberKatz Partners, said Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. owns televisionstations, newspapers and magazines in the United States ``but stillhasn't put together a package that advertisers have beensuccessfully able to use.''   John Gray, top media planner at ad agency J. Walter Thompson inNew York, said Gannett Co. has also tried ``with limited success''to sell packages of space in its newspapers and billboards and timeon its radio and TV stations.   Fulton said whether size proves a significant advantage toattract advertisers ``depends a lot on the degree to which (TimeWarner) becomes centralized rather than decentralized'' and thewishes of top management.   But will the new bosses speak with one voice on that issue?   According to the merger plans announced March 4, the new companywill initially have co-chief executives and co-chairmen, J. RichardMunro from Time and Steven J. Ross from Warner.   Both Munro and Ross were said to be unavailable for comment ontheir plans for the new company by week's end.   In their surprise announcement, Time and Warner said they hadagreed to merge in an exchange of stock that would create theworld's largest communications company with revenue of $10 billion.   Company officials said the combination would help them competeagainst foreign giants in what is becoming a global communicationsmarket.   They denied that the merger was designed as a takeover defense,but analysts say the the deal could do just that.   But there was speculation that a third party could emerge toderail the deal by bidding for either company in the months it willtake for regulatory authorities to review the deal before the mergercan be completed.
