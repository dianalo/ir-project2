By a 5-4 vote, the high court said judges may order oneparty to a lawsuit to pay the other's legal bills as a formof punishment for a pattern of abuse. This authority topenalize abuse extends not only to litigants' conduct in alawsuit, but also to other actions that aren't directlybefore the court but are related to the case, the court said.</LP><TEXT>   The decision is a departure from the general rule in stateand federal courts in the U.S. Usually, each side pays itsown attorney fees and other legal bills, regardless of whowins the case. The major exception to this pattern has beenthe federal law that allows winners in federal civilrightslawsuits to have the losers reimburse their legal costs.   In a decision written by Justice Byron White, the highcourt recognized a new exception for deliberate abuse of thecourts that can't be addressed adequately by other penaltiesjudges already are authorized to impose.   Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which governconduct in civil lawsuits, federal judges already have thepower to impose sanctions for filing frivolous courtdocuments. They also have the authority under federal law torequire lawyers who deliberately prolong lawsuits to bear theexcess legal costs. But the federal rules allow penaltiesonly for frivolous documents actually filed in court, andfederal law allows punishment only of a lawyer, not a client,and only for deliberately dragging out a case.   Justice White said federal judges have &quot;inherent power&quot; intheir duty to supervise their courts that allows them to gobeyond the sanctions allowed by the law and rules. He warned,however, that judges should use the power cautiously andsparingly.   Joel Klein, a Washington lawyer who argued and won theSupreme Court case, said the decision &quot;boldens andstrengthens the hands of federal judges in looking for waysto deal with abuses.&quot;   Mr. Klein represented Nasco Inc., a company thatcontracted in 1983 to buy a television station in LakeCharles, La., from Russell Chambers. Nasco sued after Mr.Chambers apparently changed his mind, refused to register thelegal papers with local officials and set about transferringthe television station to a trust so Nasco couldn't get itand so the federal court might lose jurisdiction over theproperty.   A federal judge issued a series of injunctions andrepeatedly warned Mr. Chambers' attorney to stop thwartingthe lawsuit or the contract to sell the station. Afterseveral years of protracted legal battles and continuedattempts by Mr. Chambers to nullify the sale, the judgeordered Mr. Chambers to pay Nasco's legal fees, whichtotalled $996,664. A federal appeals court in New Orleansupheld the order.   The Supreme Court affirmed the appeals court ruling. Theunusual penalty was required, the high court said, becausethe district judge found that Mr. Chambers took steps outsidethe court's reach, including fraud, to deprive the court ofjurisdiction over the case.   Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented, joined by Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist and Justice David Souter. Justice AntoninScalia also dissented.   Justice Kennedy complained that the decision &quot;effects avast expansion of the power of federal courts, unauthorizedby rule or statute.&quot; He also argued that some of the penaltywas imposed for Mr. Chamber's breach of contract, rather thanfor his conduct toward the federal court. Louisiana lawdoesn't allow such a penalty for breach of a contract,Justice Kennedy said, and the Supreme Court shouldn'tdisregard Louisiana law. (Chambers vs. Nasco Inc.)   ---   Real Estate Liens                                                                                                          By a 9-0 vote, the high court declared unconstitutional aConnecticut law that allows a court to put a prejudgment lienon an individual's home without notice or a hearing. Aprejudgment attachment involves a lien put on a property foran individual or company that hasn't yet won a courtdetermination of liability on the property owner's part.   In an opinion written by Justice White, the high courtsaid the Connecticut law violates the 14th Amendmentguarantee of &quot;due process.&quot; The high court said that almostall other states require that a property owner be givennotice and a hearing before a lien is attached on a home, orthat there be emergency circumstances that make itimpractical to hold a hearing first.   The justices affirmed the ruling of a federal appealscourt in New York against the Connecticut law. The law waschallenged by a Meriden, Conn., homeowner who had a $75,000lien placed on his house by another individual who planned tosue the homeowner for damages for assault. A local judgeattached a lien on the house, but the homeowner thenchallenged the constitutionality of the state law.   The decision is a blow to the Connecticut bankingindustry, which said in a friend-of-the-court brief thatbanks regularly obtain prejudgment attachments as a way ofsecuring the value of commercial and residential mortgageloans.   The brief by the Connecticut Bankers Association and theSavings Banks' Association of Connecticut warned that losingthe ability to seek prejudgment liens could &quot;create chaos&quot; inthe state's business community.   The justices were deeply divided by another issue in thecase. Four justices said that requiring the individual whoobtains a lien to post a bond doesn't eliminate the need fora hearing. But the court's majority said there was no reasonto decide that issue. (Connecticut vs. Doehr)</TEXT></DOC>
