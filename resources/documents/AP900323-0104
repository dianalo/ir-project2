The CIA employee, Norman Gardner, appeared as a defense witnessat the trial of Poindexter, the former national security adviseraccused of obstructing Congress, conspiracy and making falsestatements in the Iran-Contra affair.   ``To the best of your knowledge, was Admiral Poindexterinvolved'' in obstructing or lying to Congress about the Hawkshipment? asked defense attorney Joseph Small.   ``No,'' replied Gardner.   Gardner acknowledged under questioning, however, that Poindexternever told the House intelligence committee or Sens. DavidDurenberger and Patrick Leahy on Nov. 21, 1986, that PresidentReagan had ratified the Hawk shipment.   Poindexter tore up the presidential document authorizing thedelivery hours after meeting separately with the House committeeand then the senators.   ``Didn't you speak up'' when Poindexter omitted some facts inhis congressional meetings? asked Iran-Contra prosecutor ChristianMixter.   ``No ... I just don't do that,'' replied Gardner.   Poindexter told the congressmen Reagan didn't approve the Hawkshipment, according to Gardner's notes of the meeting.   Gardner knew about the presidential authorization, said Mixter.   Gardner recalled that Durenberger was hostile to Poindexter atthe start of their Nov. 21, 1986, meeting on the Iran initiative.   ``John, if you are not going to give us all the facts we'regoing to get the hell out of here,'' Gardner quoted Durenberger assaying.   On Thursday, former Attorney General Edwin Meese III said``everything I know'' suggests Poindexter tried to get the factsout about a shipment of missiles to Iran.   Testifying as a defense witness at Poindexter's trial, Meesesaid he never suspected the national security adviser might beconcealing from Congress the CIA's role in the arms shipment.   ``Did Admiral Poindexter ever tell you a lie?'' defense attorneyRichard Beckler asked.   ``Not to my knowledge,'' Meese replied.   Asked whether Poindexter tried to ``convey an accurate'' storyon the missile shipment, the former attorney general replied:``Everything I know about it is he did.''   ``Did you know that Admiral Poindexter'' was ``involved in thatHawks shipment?'' prosecutor Dan Webb asked.   ``No, I did not know that then and I do not know that today,''Meese replied.   Webb showed Meese a copy of a Nov. 20, 1985, computer messagefrom White House aide Oliver North to Poindexter about theimpending shipment. Meese responded by saying ``I don't knowwhether'' Poindexter received it when North sent it to him.   Meese attended a Nov. 20, 1986 meeting in Poindexter's office,where North adopted a cover story that no one in the U.S.government knew at the time that Hawk missiles were aboard an airshipment.   Asked by Beckler whether he had heard any discussion of a falsecover story at the meeting, the former attorney general replied:``No, I did not. I am sure nothing like that was ever said in mypresence at that meeting.''   Meese said Poindexter asked him to attend the meeting to ensureReagan administration officials could testify `truthfully andaccurately'' to Congress about the Iran initiative.   Webb asked Meese whether he wasn't suspicious about theassertions of lack of U.S. knowledge after discovering two daysafter the meeting that the Reagan document, known as a finding, hadratified the missile shipment.   ``No, I was not suspicious of that,'' said Meese. He explainedthat the CIA said it had discovered that Hawks were aboard only asthe shipment was under way and the finding was signed by Reagan aweek and a half after the delivery.   When Meese told Reagan on Nov. 21, 1986 a fact-finding inquirywould be launched of the Iran initiative, did Poindexter ``jumpup'' and say he had a copy of the finding in his safe? Webb asked.   ``No, he did not,'' said Meese.   ``During this time ... did John Poindexter ever tell you he haddestroyed this finding that had been signed by the president of theUnited States?'' the prosecutor asked.   ``No,'' Meese replied.</TEXT></DOC>
