In particular, meeting the demands ofpeak load ranges is of importance. The heat supply coefficient {alpha}and the annual utilization of peak load equipment tau/sub FS/ have beenchosen as the characteristic quantities to describe them. The heat priceat the consumer, C/sub V/, offers as the optimization criterion. Thetransport distance, temperature spread of the heating water, and differentcurves of annual variation of heat consumption on heat supply coefficientand heat price at the consumer. A comparison between heat supply by nuclearpower plants and nuclear heating stations verifies the advantage of combinedheat and power generation even with longer heat transport distances ascompared with local heat supply by nuclear district heating stationsbased on the criterion of minimum employment of peak load boilers.</TEXT></DOC>
