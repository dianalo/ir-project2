The United States has argued the measure would hurt the Americanfilm and television industry's earnings abroad and suggested itmight violate international trade rules.   Despite strong U.S. lobbying in recent months, the foreignministers of the European Community approved a plan that wouldremove barriers to TV broadcasting in the 12-nation trading bloc.   Belgium and Denmark opposed the measure, according to communityspokesmen.   Martin Bangemann, the community's top official on industrialmatters, said criticism of the measure was unjustified.   ``It cannot constitute an infringement of international traderules,'' he told reporters.   There was no immediate reaction from U.S. officials.   The plan, Television Without Frontiers, is part of thecommunity's move to create a single market of 320 million consumersin late 1992.   By the end of 1992 the dozen nations are scheduled to remove themany trade barriers restricting the free movement of money, goods,services and people.   The TV measure set out the conditions under which broadcastersin Europe would be allowed to transmit channels throughout thetrading bloc.   In doing so, it said governments must ensure that a majority oftransmission time be reserved _ ``where practicable and byappropriate means'' _ for European-made programs.   Excluded from the provision were news, sports and games programsas well as ads.   British Foreign Secretary John King said there were assurancesthat the measure would not be regarded as applying legally bindingquotas.   ``We clearly wanted to avoid ... a Fortress Europe and the fearsof a Fortress Europe,'' he told reporters.   The measure, he said, was ``seen as political objectives and nota numerical straitjacket.''   ``It's not a legal obligation,'' said Bangemann. ``It's apolitical commitment.''   King said Britain would not change its treatment of U.S.programs. About 15 percent of the programs broadcst by majorBritish stations comes from outside the community, he said.   ``Any fans of `Dallas' or `Dynasty' need have no doubtwhatsoever that they will continue to get their programs,'' he said.   The United States has urged the community to scrap the plan. TheAmerican entertainment industry said its European earnings would beseriously hurt by such a restriction.   During a European swing last month, U.S. Trade RepresentativeCarla Hills reiterated the American opposition.   ``We are not in favor of local content in any context and moreparticularly in the province of thoughts,'' she said.   Local content provisions refer to measures requiring that acertain percentage of a product be produced domestically.   Mrs. Hills had earlier written key members of the EuropeanParliament, the community's legislative body, to complain about theTV measure.   Community quotas, she wrote, ``would be blatantlydiscriminatory, patently unjustifiable, and would almost certainlyhave a disastrous effect on the U.S. industry's substantialEuropean earnings.''   Defenders of quotas argued that European culture was at stake.They fear a flood of American soap operas, sitcoms and otherprograms would tie up the airwaves.</TEXT></DOC>
