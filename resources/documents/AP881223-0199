The Commerce Department said Thursday that durable goods ordersclimbed 1.8 percent in November, not counting the erratic defensecategory.   The report had little effect on the financial markets.   Including defense orders, total durable goods orders edged uponly 0.1 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted $122.89billion. That followed a giant 2.9 percent rise in October.   The overall figure was inflated by a big jump in military ordersin October and then depressed when military orders returned to morenormal levels last month.   Discounting the swings in defense, orders in the civiliancategory climbed 1.8 percent in November, the best showing since a5.2 percent August increase. Civilin orders had risen only 0.2percent in October.   Analysts said they were impressed by the strength in civilianorders, and said the orders should keep U.S. plants operating busilythrough the first half of 1989.   ``This was an impressive gain and it should pretty much insurethat the economy will keep growing next year,'' said Michael Evans,head of a Washington forecasting firm.   Financial markets were quiet Thursday heading into the Christmasholiday.   On Wall Street, the stock market posted a modest loss. The DowJones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.28 points to 2,160.36.   In the bond market, prices edged up slightly as the yield on theTreasury's benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.93 percent.   The dollar drifted higher against most major currencies inextremely thin trading. It stood at 1.7729 West German marks and124.68 Japanese yen in late New York trading.   Oil prices continued rising. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,the February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude, rose 19 cents to $16.49 a barrel after rising15 cents Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
