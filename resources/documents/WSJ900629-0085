At that moment, they can cash in their tattered Ostmarksfor West German marks, the world's No. 2 reserve currency.More to the point, a people who have lived under nearly 60years of dictatorship and central planning -- first in NaziGermany and then in East Germany -- will be thrown off theirsinking ship of socialism into the ice-cold water ofcapitalism.</LP><TEXT>   The East Germans' great advantage over other EastEuropeans is their generous life raft. As a rich and growingcapitalist country of 62 million people, West Germany willovernight absorb a poor and decaying one with only one-fourthits population and one-tenth its economic might.   Their biggest disadvantage is that the pace of Germanreunification has deprived them of a chance to prepare forthe swim or take responsibility for their own futures, whichwill be financed by West Germany and guided by armies of WestGerman advisers, businessmen and politicians.   &quot;I don't see any problem in financing East Germany,&quot; saysKurt Kasch, the board member responsible for East Germanlending at West Germany's largest commercial bank, DeutscheBank. &quot;West Germany is booming, and sufficient capital isavailable. The problem will be how to restructure thecompanies and the thinking of the people. There isn't yet aplan, but only stop-gap measures. I don't doubt there may bea disaster along the way. Their whole economy is like that ofa company under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.&quot;   The Western bailout will increase the pressure here forrapid unification as East Germans realize the impotence oftheir own politicians to address inevitable problems ofunemployment, corporate bankruptcies and the threat ofanother mass migration westward.   Before unification can occur, however, East Germans mustrecreate their old federal states in local elections thisSeptember; then the states, under the West Germanconstitution, must vote themselves into the new union. WestGermans hope that by November the Soviet Union will removethe last international obstacle to unification. If all goesaccording to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's plans, all-Germanelections on Dec. 9 or 16 will be the final step beforeformal political unification, which should be completed byChristmas.   Yet it is this weekend that marks the point of no return.The two Germanys may technically remain separate for a while,but their economies and their fates will become joined.   &quot;The importance of July 1 is that the people of EastGermany now know they belong to the West,&quot; says WalterMomper, West Berlin's mayor. &quot;They know that from that pointon, the West German government is legally and economicallyresponsible for them.&quot; The problem, he adds, is that &quot;in afew months, they have to make adjustments that took us 40years. Anyone who says he knows what will happen is lying.None of us know.&quot;   As D-mark day nears, the commander of the Bundesbank'sground forces sits in symbolic discomfort, surrounded byconstruction workers, in the expansive former offices of theCommunist Party's top ideologist. The Central Committee'sinsignia have been stripped from the building's gray outerwalls, and its capitalist usurper has announced theBundesbank's arrival only on a handwritten sign on the door.A decision-making center of communism has become the nervecenter of the transition to capitalism.   &quot;You might read too much into the symbolism of ourlocation,&quot; says Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the 47-year-oldBundesbank official overseeing the distribution of 600 tonsof bank notes and 500 tons of coins from 15 central-bankoffices throughout the country. &quot;There is a more practicalreason for us to be here.&quot; The Bundesbank's headquartershere, once the main office of the Third Reich's central bankas well, has the largest vaults available in Europe.   Fleets of vehicles, their routes and timetablestop-secret, have already delivered an initial installment of25 billion West German marks, twice the amount of cash incirculation in East Germany. Mr. Gaddum wants to be sure notto run low on such a historic day. In coming months, whenEast German companies start doing business in the newcurrency, the Bundesbank will have to provide perhaps 130billion more West German marks. West German economists expectthis action to swell their own money supply by 13.5% to 14%,but they believe the enhanced growth from the addition ofEast Germany's economy will allow them to absorb the deutschemarks without significant inflation.   &quot;This is the most exciting assignment I can imagine,&quot; Mr.Gaddum says. &quot;For the citizen of East Germany, the D-markisn't a currency; it is a symbol of freedom. He can travel toSweden; he can buy products he's only seen on television.Great hopes and dreams are attached to July 1.&quot;   And great fears.   The irony of this Sunday's monetary and currency union isthat it is forcing together a people only now learning howfar they had grown apart since Germany was divided afterWorld War II. Even their languages had added vocabulary theother Germans didn't understand. Poland, Hungary andCzechoslovakia may suffer far worse economic difficulties,but the psychological burden will be greater here. EastGermans must discard more than four decades of history andadjust overnight to the laws, expectations and demands of anew society that already regards them as second-classcitizens.   &quot;Monetary union is the vise that is intended to hold ustogether, but it isn't a very good tool for that purpose,&quot;says Baerbel Bohley, an abstract artist who was a leader ofthe October &quot;revolution&quot; now leading to unification. &quot;It willonly make our differences all the more apparent.&quot;   She points outside the window of her office in EastBerlin's City Hall, where dozens of orange garbage truckshave gathered and hundreds of workers mill about in brightorange overalls. It looks more like an Orange Juliusconvention than a strike, but it reeks of trouble.   &quot;Our luck is that we have a weapon that you can smell,&quot;says Guenther SvenOlaf, a 28-year-old union leader. Workerscomplain that they earn half the wage of West Berlin garbagecollectors but handle twice the tonnage per person. They passout handbills with statistics showing that West Berlinindustrial companies pay eight times more to have theirgarbage removed than East Berlins do. They say a pay raise isnecessary to avoid &quot;garbage tourism&quot; -- companies shippingrefuse East, to dispose of it more cheaply. &quot;East Berlincould become the garbage dump of Europe if we don't increaseour charges and wages,&quot; Mr. Sven-Olaf says.   Yet East Germans are caught in a Catch-22. Workers, eggedon by West German unions, are demanding higher wages to avoidbeing second-class Germans. But just such demands are whathave kept West German and other investors at bay.   Many West German companies that at first wanted to investheavily in East Germany now are merely relying on unusedcapacity in their existing plants to serve a new market nolarger than that of the federal state of North RhineWestphalia. They are reluctant to invest because of expectedwage increases, the lack of infrastructure such astelecommunications and transportation, a weak network ofsuppliers, and East German companies' debt, which isn't beingwritten off but is being translated into D-marks at a 2-to-1rate. Their reluctance threatens to aggravate unemployment,which could deepen the economic divide between East and WestGermany.   But if wages are too low and services too skimpy in theEast, the outflow of East Germans will increase. Even withthe West German mark coming East, 1,000 East Germans a weekcontinue to head West.   The game of guessing how this grand experiment will panout has become intense. After months of work, the GermanResearch Institute of West Berlin has produced a forecast ofshort-term gloom, which will satisfy the doomsayers of theleft, and of medium-term optimism, which will feed theboosterism of Chancellor Kohl's government. The institute'seconomists anticipate greater problems than Bonn haspredicted for East Germany's current-account deficit (itsdeficit in foreign trade in goods and services), itsunemployment and its plunging production.   &quot;The East Germans have the hardest road in Eastern Europeover the very short term, but in the long-run they will dothe best,&quot; says Heiner Flassbeck, who directed theforecasting project.   The institute believes that East German unemployment willhit 17% next year despite federal subsidies designed tomitigate it. Another 13% of East Germans will be classifiedas short-time workers, mostly working under subsidy programs.So some 30% of East Germans won't be fully employed. SomeWest German bankers are even gloomier.   The unemployment forecasts reflect an even more basiceconomic imbalance. East Germans' desire to buy the Westerngoods so long denied them will drive up imports by apredicted 16.5% this year and 34.5% in 1991. But theircompanies' inability to produce competitive goods may causeexports to fall 15% this year and 10% in 1991, and productionto slip 9.5% this year and 19% in 1991.   The institute predicts an East German current-accountdeficit this year of 37 billion marks and next year of 72billion marks -- in an economy of only 270 billion marks. Thefinancing requirement would be nearly double that foreseen bythe West German government in its state treaty with EastGermany.   &quot;No other East European economy could afford that price,but here Bonn will pick up the tab,&quot; Mr. Flassbeck says.   The picture would be far gloomier if West Germany'seconomic outlook weren't so bright. West Germany will outpaceits neighbors this year with real growth of some 4% -- partlyboosted by a doubling of exports to East Germany. The growthin West German employment levels in the past year has beenthe highest in three decades, and the inflation rate isexpected to remain under 3%. &quot;Under the changed conditions,growth over the next two years of nearly 10% in real termscan be expected,&quot; the institute predicts.   But Bonn must revamp East Germany both radically andquickly. For if this grand experiment fails, it not only willset off mass westward migration but also feed already-risingleft-wing and right-wing radicalism in what is now EastGermany. Success or failure, in addition, could help orhinder reformist politicians in the Soviet Union andelsewhere in Eastern Europe.   The fear of the effects of mass unemployment has been sostrong that the West German government has set up an officethat will provide guaranteed loans through West German banksto East German companies in the first three months. Some ofthe companies may survive longer than they should, but theidea is to give them money to retool quickly and pay theirworkers before they make their first West German profits. Theloans are to be extended only a month at a time, and the onuswill be on the banks to identify firms whose loans are to berenewed and firms that will be allowed to fail.   &quot;No company in East Germany is ready to be competitivewith West German or West European companies,&quot; says DeutscheBank's Mr. Kasch, who has studied 40 East German concerns. Aclose inspection of one glassmaker by Roland Berger G.m.b.H.,a consulting firm owned by the bank, discovered that oncesubsidies were removed, a multimillion-dollar book profitturned into a multimillion-dollar loss. &quot;The percentage ofcompanies that can become competitive anytime soon is lessthan 20%,&quot; Mr. Kasch says.   Nevertheless, the German Economic Research Institutepredicts stabilization late next year and a turnaround in1992. It does see some problems lingering well into the 21stcentury.   East Germany's stunned paralysis has increased in recentweeks as West German companies and ministries move in like awave of capitalist missionaries selling the profit motive.Burger King will open for business in Dresden on America'sIndependence Day, July 4. Mail-order companies have alreadyset up kiosks on street corners. Even West German sex shopsare passing out their catalogs -- in plain brown wrappers --to East Germans.   In a speech in West Berlin, Guenter Grass, the novelist,complained that he found on a trip through East Germany thatthe people were engaged in a &quot;self-destructive&quot; practice ofallowing their own products to be forced off the shelves. Inthe brewery town of Altdoebern, he said, a Munich brewery hadprovided the village pub with free beer coasters, menus anddecor on condition that the owner no longer sell East Germanbeer. The local brewery has already shut down.   In the Prenzlauer section of East Berlin, Kaufhalle, aWest German supermarket chain, has taken over a state-runneighborhood store. This weekend, its workers will put outbrightly labeled containers on shelves that have been emptiedby shoppers fearing price increases and seeking to unloadEast German marks. Yet even people who want the goods seemoverwhelmed by the range of choice.   &quot;I've always known that salt packages are white and sugarpackages are blue,&quot; says Ms. Bohley, the artist and now amember of East Berlin's city council. &quot;Now, we have to readthe labels of many different packages we don't recognize.This feeds a more general uncertainty.&quot;   That may be, but East Germans appear to be catching onfast. All over the country, shops have hauled out onto thesidewalks their East Bloc goods -- ranging fromCzechoslovakian beer to homemade furniture -- to sell atprice reductions of as much as 70%. A whole people appears tobe engaged in a clearance sale.   The familiar lines for goods have been replaced byblock-long queues of East Germans putting their money intobank accounts and applying for the amounts they want towithdraw next week. On Sunday morning, about 10,000 exchangecenters, including bank offices, schools and other governmentbuildings, will start passing out the money. Security will betight: East German police and army units have detailed atleast 30,000 men.   The Bundesbank will avoid chaos through some simple rules:   -- No cash exchanges will be made. All East Germans,including children, must first deposit their money in apersonal bank account, where they automatically will berebooked as West German marks at midnight, June 30. That way,the Bundesbank's computers can spot irregularities.   -- In the first week of July, no East German can withdrawmore than 2,000 West German marks. The purpose is to avoid abuying mania.   Commercial banks moving quickly into the East Germanmarket also see the week as an opportunity to marketinvestments unfamiliar to East Germans. An informal survey ofEast Germans, however, shows that most wouldn't withdraw muchmoney anyway; they aren't sure just how much prices mightrise or whether they might soon be jobless. After July 9,they can withdraw as much money as they please.   East Germans can deposit their old money in accounts untilnext Friday. &quot;Whoever has East German marks after that canpaper their walls with them,&quot; says the weekly magazine DerStern. So no one can exchange more than the limited amountsallowed at a 1-to-1 rate, identity cards will be stamped withindelible marking. East Germans under age 14 may exchange2,000 East German marks at 1 to 1, those under 59 years ofage may exchange 4,000 East German marks at that rate, andthose older may exchange 6,000 East German marks. All othermoney in accounts can be exchanged at 2 to 1 -- even WestGermans with East marks in accounts predating Dec. 31, 1989.But to penalize speculation, money deposited by foreignersafter that will be exchanged at 3-to-1.   But all this hasn't stopped speculators. The mostsophisticated ones have acted as brokers between those whodidn't have any money to put in accounts and those who wantedto spread their money around to exchange as much as possibleat 1 to 1. The commission initially charged for this servicewas 10%, but by the end of this week it reached 50%.   The dingy corridors of East Germany's finance ministryhaven't seen so much nervous tension since Luftwaffe chiefHermann Goering worked in the building during World War II.State Secretary Martin Maassen has been working 18-hour daystrying to apply West German trading and tax laws to EastGermany. He is boundlessly optimistic that, despiteshort-term problems, his people will get a better life. Buthe concedes that his position after Sunday will be a novelone.   &quot;There's seldom been a finance ministry without its owncurrency,&quot; he says. Yet Mr. Maassen is glad thenerve-wracking buildup is ending. &quot;All the planning and worryis over,&quot; he says. &quot;After Sunday, we all become crisismanagers.&quot;   ---          Key Issues in German Monetary Unification                                                                                                          -- Inflation. Despite fears of the kind of inflation thatravaged Weimar Germany, inflation is expected to remain low.Prices of many East German commodities, such as bread, willrise sharply but then remain stable.                                                                                                          -- Unemployment. Some experts predict East Germanunemployment will rise as high as 40%, at least temporarily.Numerous East German companies are expected to fail.                                                                                                          -- Restructurings. Those East German companies thatsurvive will have to undertake dramatic restructurings andmodernization, financed initially by loans guaranteed by theWest German government.                                                                                                          -- Compensation. East German workers need to be paidenough to keep them from migrating west, but not so much asto discourage Western investment in East Germany.                                                                                                          -- Labor unrest.
