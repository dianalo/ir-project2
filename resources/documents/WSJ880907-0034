You drop off your daughter, 12 years old, and your father-in-law, 80, at the first-floor Family Care Center. In your office, you look over yesterday's mail (you aren't working Tuesdays this summer), and find a message from the company's School Services: They've received the tuition bill for your son's freshman year in college and have paid it. You write a memo to your boss, outlining your plan for a three-month unpaid sabbatical to work with homeless children.    The traditional definition of employee benefits is familiar to most workers. Designed to meet the needs of the majority, benefits are the extras that employers provide to make life outside of work more manageable and secure. Most companies no longer call them &quot;fringe.&quot;    But this basic concept, itself only a few decades old, is changing. As the male breadwinner is replaced by a host of demographic variables, more companies are finding that benefits can't be reduced to a simple common package. To attract the most talented workers, they are beginning to offer a wider range of benefits -- letting employees pick those most important to them. Moreover, these new benefits often revolve around life inside the office, instead of just outside extras.    How far will these changes go? In an informal survey, benefits consultants and corporate executives were asked to speculate on what the next 20 years may bring. Most agree that today's core benefits -- life, health and disability coverage, vacation and pension -- will remain, although restructured. They expect many benefits just now appearing -- such as child care -- to be standard in 20 years. And they predict that changes in the work force will spawn myriad new benefits, many of which seem as far-fetched now as today's benefits did a couple of decades ago.    Here's a look at some of their predictions:   LEAVE   Despite corporate opposition to a bill now in Congress that would mandate it, unpaid leave will be widely available, allowing employees to care for newborn or newly adopted babies, sick children and dependents. Many companies will also permit employees to take unpaid leaves to do volunteer work or to go back to school to study a job-related subject.    In about 10 years, a few companies will offer paid leave for dependent care, probably of one to two months, to be followed by unpaid leave of six months, predicts Margaret Meiers, a senior associate at Catalyst, a New York research group. Although some companies may offer partial pay, she thinks all leaves will include job guarantees.    A driving force behind such a change, Ms. Meiers believes, will be the growing problem of &quot;elder care.&quot; She says that the corporations are not ready to accept male middle managers taking leaves to care for children. That same social stigma, however, is not associated with caring for an elderly parent. And because so many more men -- including those in senior positions -- have that experience, it is bringing more credibility to the idea of such leaves of absence.    EDUCATION and TRAINING   Firms may pay not only to subsidize continuing education for employees, but college tuition for their children, says Arnold Brown, chairman of Weiner, Edrich, Brown, a consulting firm in New York. Hoping to ease employees' worries about tuition and keep them from shopping around for higher-paying jobs, companies will offer low-cost education loans and, later, outright payments, as benefit-plan options, Mr. Brown says.    Mr. Brown also imagines that labor shortages will mean that retraining programs -- now rare in companies -- will become common. If there's less demand in one area of the company, employees from that area would be routinely trained to move to another department.    Pat Choate, vice president for policy analysis at TRW Inc., a Cleveland-based aerospace, automotive and electronics company, goes further. He foresees a transformed unemployment-compensation system: Money would be set aside not only for unemployment insurance, as is done now, but also for unemployment training, so that anyone out of work would draw weekly supplements for schooling in new skills.    JOB PATH   As part of their broader definition of benefits, many corporations will help employees plan careers that adjust to their changing lives. Rather than a set fast track, people will be able to &quot;move up, down or even out (temporarily) and still be a part of the corporation,&quot; says Karen Geiger, director of career development at NCNB Corp., a bank holding company in Charlotte, N.C.    Managers, for instance, may meet with each employee every year, in an effort to find out what the employee can handle over the coming months. Can the employee travel a lot? Work extra hours? Work full time? Companies will have to identify the time commitment each job requires, says Ms. Geiger, and then try to match the job with people's needs.    If for several years an executive with children, for example, doesn't want to move up, requests a lateral move or refuses to relocate, &quot;salaries will have to be held back, but you won't be penalized for life,&quot; says Ms. Geiger. When that employee wants more responsibility later, the company will welcome that request.    HOUSING   Colgate-Palmolive Co. in New York, already helps any salaried employees buy or refinance a primary residence. Employees receive a mortgage through the same financial company that handles Colgate's employee-relocation program. And Colgate picks up the loan-origination fee, or part of it, depending on the mortgage size.    Sandra Shaber, an economist at Futures Group, a consulting firm in Washington, D.C., believes that many companies will one day help employees cover their expenses on a greater scale, especially where housing costs are most prohibitive.    A company could offer employees variable-rate loans, pegged slightly below market rates; employees would lose the rate advantage, however, if they left the company, she suggests.    LATE RETIREMENT   As baby boomers age, and shortages of workers and skills increase, companies will be bending over backwards to keep their older employees. The result: &quot;Platinum Handcuffs,&quot; as TRW's Mr. Choate calls them -- consisting of company-paid vacation trips, shorter hours, and bonus plans that reward employees for staying on past a certain age or period of service.    Warren L. Moser, retired director of employee benefits at Southwestern Bell Corp., says companies could designate &quot;premium years&quot; in calculating pension payments. If each year worked before age 50, for example, counted as one year of service in the formula, each year worked beyond 50 could count as 1.3 years. Similarly, companies could pay a progressively bigger percentage of health-insurance costs for retirees who quit working at 60, 65 or 70 than for those quitting at 55.    Mr. Moser himself is now a vice president at United HealthCare Inc. in Baltimore, a job he says he chose over one paying about 50% more, largely because he has a contract that allows him to vary and shorten his workweek, giving him &quot;phased-in retirement.&quot;    FLEXTIME   On July 1 at Du Pont Co. in Wilmington, Del., a group of 40 people in the employee-benefits department began tailoring their own work hours. The group agreed to some rules, such as keeping to each new schedule for at least a month and taking no more than two hours for lunch. But within the rules, for example, an employee could come in at 7 a.m., take a 30-minute lunch and leave at 3:30. Two secretaries in one section, both with children at home, are alternating schedules monthly because each wanted the same hours.    Although each employee must work eight hours a day, five days a week, compensation director C.W. Lee says this is just the beginning. At almost all companies, he predicts, hours will be more flexible. Part-time workers will share jobs, for instance, and most employees will be able to work at least part of the time at home. &quot;The good Lord didn't say, 'thou shalt work 40 hours a week, 9 to 5, with an hour for lunch,'&quot; says Mr. Lee.    At a Volvo plant in Sweden, &quot;the ultimate in flextime&quot; has already arrived, says Paul Bernstein, dean of graduate studies at Rochester Institute of Technology. Employees choose between seven shifts. Shift Two, for example, is from 5:18 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays and, on alternating weeks, 2 to 11 p.m., except Fridays, when work ends at 8. This shift has been especially popular with mothers, who can see children leave for -- or get home from -- school, and have a half-day free for errands. Employees who volunteer for a less-desirable shift, such as 12 hours each on Saturday and Sunday, are paid for 40 hours and can go back to a weekday schedule at a month's notice.    VACATION   Although few benefits experts expect Americans to begin taking the five- and six-week vacations common in Western Europe, they do think more employees will be able to &quot;buy&quot; extra time if they want it.    Something like this is being considered by David Barash, director of human resources at Ben andamp; Jerry's Homemade Inc., an ice-cream maker in Waterbury, Vt. Under a &quot;flexbanking&quot; system he is thinking about, all benefits would be assigned credits in a common &quot;currency, sort of like Monopoly&quot; money. Each employee could spend the credits as he or she wants, with some restrictions.    One employee with 100 discretionary credits in the &quot;bank,&quot; for instance, might spend 50 on medical and dental, 10 on child care, 20 on elder care and 20 on vacations, suggests Mr. Barash. Another employee with no children who was covered under a spouse's medical plan might want to spend 50 credits on life insurance, 10 on legal assistance, 10 on care for a sick parent, and 30 on vacations.    Ben andamp; Jerry's, however, has one benefit that can't be banked -- and is unlikely to be a staple at other firms in the future: Each employee is allowed to take home three pints of ice cream a day.    ---                         Looking Ahead    In a recent survey of 100 major industrial companies, benefits directors were asked which areas would see &quot;major growth&quot; by 1995:    Flexible medical plan                    84%    Long-term care coverage                  82%    Elder-care benefits                      77%    Flexible schedules                       72%    Employer-sponsored day care              66%    Group universal life insurance           58%    Mail order prescription drugs            54%    Source: Hewitt Associates                      Ranking the Benefits    Medical                                  89%    Pension                                  37%    Paid vacation and holidays               31%    Short-term disability and sick days      30%    Dental                                   28%    After-tax savings/profit-sharing plan    24%    Long-term disability                     19%    Life insurance                           17%</TEXT></DOC>
