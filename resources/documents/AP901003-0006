HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An intestinal operation to lower the cholesterolof heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heartattack or death from heart disease, researchers said today.   The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, has one significantdrawback: It causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years.   In the operation, doctors change the route of the smallintestine so about one-third of it is bypassed. This reduces theamount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream.   The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who hadalready suffered heart attacks. The approach lengthened the livesof people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with moresevere heart damage.   During an average of 10 years of follow up, the death rate amongsurgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was 24percent. In a comparison group without the intestinal surgery, itwas 39 percent.   Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directedthe study, said the surgery should be considered along withcholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.   ``It has a role in the management of patients with highcholesterol who have had a heart attack,'' Buchwald said. ``It iseminently logical to extend all cholesterol-lowering therapy,including this, to patients with high cholesterol who have not hada heart attack.''   Besides diarrhea, those who undergo the surgery are somewhatmore prone to have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinalobstructions.   The study was conducted in Minneapolis, Los Angeles,Philadelphia and Little Rock, Ark., and published in today's NewEngland Journal of Medicine.   Despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering, doubts remainabout whether it actually helps people live longer if they alreadyhave healthy hearts. Although the latest study was conductedexclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks, Buchwald saidhe believes the research should settle that question.   ``It offers the strongest justification for marked lipid(cholesterol) ineervention that has ever been offered,'' Buchwaldsaid. ``It is a very powerful study and should, except for certainpeople who will never be satisfied, end the cholesterolcontroversy.''   In the study, 421 people who recovered from heart attacksunderwent the surgery, while a comparison group of 417 people weretreated with diet alone. At the start of the study, their averagecholesterol levels were 251. The surgery lowered people'scholesterol 23 percent.   The overall risk of dying from heart disease or sufferinganother non-fatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent among thesurgical patients with the healthiest hearts. The surgical patientsalso required less than half as many coronary bypass operationsbecause of clogged heart arteries.</TEXT></DOC>
