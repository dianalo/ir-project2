(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Carolina today banned shellfishharvesting and warned against swimming in the ocean and rivers,saying Hurricane Hugo had left waters choked with sewage.   Workers also resumed efforts today to reopen a bridge to thestate's devastated resort islands, and officials orderedconstruction of an eight-mile-long sand dune to protect the beachfrom high tides later this month.   As tons of supplies poured into the state, relief officials saidthey were awash in clothing and urged donors to instead send cash,food and building supplies.   Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn, returned from ahelicopter tour of the coast Monday sobered by the extent of thedestruction.   ``It's really incredible. There are areas that look like warzones,'' said Mrs. Quayle, who helped out Monday takingapplications at a Federal Emergency Management Agency center inMoncks Corner.   ``I think people understand that this has been devastating. Ithink we can see that in the nationwide outpouring of volunteersthat the whole country understands.''   Hurricane Hugo slammed into South Carolina Sept. 21 with 135 mphwinds, leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless,and homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings damaged ordestroyed far inland and in North Carolina. In all, Hugo killed 29people on the U.S. mainland.   The warning against swimming could last for months and possiblyaffect the spring tourist season, said Wayne Fanning of theDepartment of Health and Environmental Control.   The indefinite ban on shellfishing was enacted because the 10major sewage treatment plants in the Charleston area are notworking fully and only 30 percent of the pollutants are beingremoved, Fanning said. When released into rivers, the wastedepletes oxygen in the water, causing widespread fish kills.   Rain that has hurt recovery efforts continued in some parts ofthe South.   In Monroe, N.C., a community that was in Hugo's path, a man andwoman were killed Monday when their car was washed into a floodedcreek. A search resumed today for a 17-year-old girl who was ridingin the car.   The nation's generosity toward storm victims has brought abacklog of donated clothing, including boxcar loads from the WestCoast, said Maj. Ken Bush of the Salvation Army.   In the hard-hit fishing village of McClellanville about 30 milesnortheast of Charleston, the school is filled with donated clothes,said Billy Newsome of the American Red Cross.   ``Used clothing has almost choked us to death,'' he said, addingwhat's needed is donations of non-perishable food and buildingsupplies.   The Army Corps of Engineers prepared to repair the Ben SawyerBridge _ the only link between the mainland and the devastatedresorts of Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms. The storm leftthe swing bridge hanging at a 45-degree angle with one endsubmerged in the water.   Workers were to float barges under the dangling section and usethe rising tide late today to help raise the bridge, said corpsspokesman Rod Ruffennach. Then cranes will swing the bridge backinto position.   The bridge will be left in position for cars to traverse untilexperts determine whether they can repair the swing mechanism thatopens the bridge to allow boats to pass on the IntracoastalWaterway.   The Corps also announced that two contractors will pour sand oneight miles of beaches from North Myrtle Beach to Pawleys Islandlater this week.   The sand is meant to block further erosion of hurricane-damagedproperty during a surge of high tides expected in mid-October.   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said 60 trucks carryingcanned food, clothing and other necessities rolled into the cityMonday.   The mayor also said the city's dawn-to-dusk curfew, in effectsince the storm, has been shortened to 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., but wasstill being enforced by the National Guard.   Riley said about 90 percent of the city's hotels have reopenedand many restaurants are back in business.   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., took to the Senate floor Mondayand continued his criticism of the Federal Emergency ManagementAgency, which is coordinating the federal government's response tothe disaster.   ``FEMA does not have but 10 centers in South Carolina 10 daysafter the disaster,'' he said. ``And, as far as I know, they stillhaven't given out a financial grant yet.''   Damage in South Carolina alone has been estimated at $3 billionor more, with crop damage placed at $100 million.</TEXT></DOC>
