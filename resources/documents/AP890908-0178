A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia said in a unanimous opinion the ``extraordinary... sensitivity of the bulk'' of the employees in the programjustifies ``the invasions of privacy entailed by conducting'' randomdrug testing.   The American Federation of Government Employees had appealed aU.S. District Court dismissal of its court challenge to the program.   The union had filed suit in an attempt to block testing not basedon suspicion of drug use, saying such a practice violated theprohibitions of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments against searcheswithout probable cause and self-incrimination.   The union attacked drug testing of motor vehicle operators,hazardous material inspectors and aircraft mechanics at the FederalAviation Administration, appeals court judge David Sentelle noted.   All three job categories should be included because of theirimportance to public safety.   ``We have found the privacy interests of employees occupying thethree specifically challenged positions outweighed by theDepartment's compelling interests in preventing drug use among suchpersonnel,'' said the judges.   The FAA's 12,000 air traffic controllers belong to a differentunion, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, and werenot a party to the case.   Also subject to the random drug testing are electronictechnicians, aviation and railroad safety inspectors and civilaviation security specialists.   The appeals court decision ``represents a great victory for thedepartment,'' Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said in astatement. The public ``expects and deserves a drug-free and safetransportation system,'' Skinner said.</TEXT></DOC>
