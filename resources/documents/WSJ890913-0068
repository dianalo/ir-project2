Terms weren't disclosed, but Jay Chazanoff, senior executive vice president of the Integrated parent, said it is a &quot;small transaction&quot; outside its core businesses that would have &quot;no impact at all&quot; under Integrated's restructuring.    Integrated last month agreed to sell a group of its core financial-services businesses to Whitehall Financial Group for $310 million. Integrated, which is trying to restructure debt in the face of a cash crisis, has been seeking to sell assets to pay creditors.    Essex, a closely held company that markets annuities and mutual funds through banks, said the purchase would create a company with total sales exceeding $750 million a year.    Kevin E. Crowe, chairman, president and chief executive of Essex, which is based here and has been operating since 1978, will remain chairman and chief executive. Jerry Cunningham, president of the Integrated unit, will become president of Essex. </TEXT></DOC>
