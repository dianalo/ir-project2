The choice means Chileans will be asked to vote yes or no to extending Gen. Pinochet's authoritarian rule to almost a quarter century. It reflects the failure to find a compromise candidate less likely to polarize the nation and the president's stubborn conviction that only he can prevent Chile's descent into Marxist chaos.    Most opinion polls indicate a close result, with the no vote dominant in Santiago, the capital, but losing ground to the regime's supporters in the provinces. If the majority votes no, multicandidate elections would be held in late 1989 or early 1990, with the new president taking office in March 1990.    &quot;I am afraid for the first time in some years,&quot; says leading socialist Sergio Bitar, commenting on the likely ruthlessness of a campaign that the regime portrays as a fight between free-market prosperity and a return to socialism. Mr. Bitar, a minister in the democratically elected Marxist government of Salvador Allende, was sent to a concentration camp for a year when Gen. Pinochet seized power in a 1973 military coup in which Mr. Allende died.    The plebiscite will revive an old struggle between a military establishment convinced of its mission to govern Chile, and a host of centrist and left-wing parties that have, at least for now, buried their differences. But it will also pit the beneficiaries of a sweeping liberalization that has boosted and diversified the economy, against those still marooned at the bottom with falling real wages.    The export-led economic boom of the past three years, known here as the &quot;silent revolution,&quot; has created several centers of prosperity in the provinces dedicated to the export of such products as grapes, asparagus and salmon. It has involved a doubling of exports, massive foreign investment, privatization and major cuts in the bureaucracy. A market-oriented success story, it has posed a dilemma to the U.S., which advocates just such policies for Latin America but has been trying to extend movement toward democracy in the region.    The military regime stresses these achievements -- and their alleged vulnerability. &quot;All this is reversible, but in five years it won't be,&quot; says Patricia Matte Larrain, a close aide to Gen. Pinochet. Advertising harps relentlessly on the economic hardships of Mr. Allende's former &quot;Popular Unity&quot; government.    Many see this as an effective message in a country where fear of a new leftward lurch exists. Less effective, apparently, has been the military government's use of the unlikely &quot;Yes to Democracy&quot; slogan, devised in an apparent bid to convince Chileans that, even under Gen. Pinochet, scheduled congressional elections in 1990 could bring a measure of democracy.    Mr. Bitar sees this campaign as an attempt by the military to counter a drift to &quot;no&quot; votes by moderates who approve of the regime's policies but can't accept eight more years of Gen. Pinochet. Some right-wing parties indicated they prefered a civilian compromise candidate.    &quot;If a compromise candidate had been chosen, we would have lost some support,&quot; Mr. Bitar says. A compromise candidate had been advocated by the U.S. as the smoothest potential path to democracy.    The opposition aims to project a message of moderation, saying it will adjust rather than undo the regime's economic reforms. It will avoid choosing a formal leader so as not to give the regime a focus of attack, and is concentrating on the economic record of the entire 15 years of military rule, rather than recent years. The record is mixed, with minimum wages of $48 a month -- among the lowest in Latin America -- still widespread.    A main problem for the opposition is the government's domination of the media. Up to now, the regime, while freely promoting itself, has refused to let the opposition advertise. This will now change, but the &quot;no&quot; campaign is certain to remain at a disadvantage.    Moreover, while a state of siege was recently lifted, brutality is never far from the surface. This week, women parading the names of people who have &quot;disappeared&quot; were sprayed with tear gas as military vehicles stormed through a crowded central Santiago street. Such incidents are likely to multiply in the runup to the Oct. 5 vote. </TEXT></DOC>
