Interior Secretary Manuel Bartlett said early Monday that CarlosSalinas de Gortari of the governing Institutuional RevolutionaryParty, known as the PRI for its Spanish initials, had 52.89 percentof the votes counted.   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front wassecond with 29.10 percent and conservative National Action Partycandidate Manuel Clouthier third with 16.68 percent, Bartlett said.Election officials said 13.24 million votes had been counted fromWednesday's election but did not say how many of the nation's 38million registered voters cast ballots.   PRI officials in Cardenas' home state of Michoacan conceded thatCardenas won 58 percent of the vote there to Salinas' 25 percent.Cardenas was a popular governor of the state from 1980-86.   Party officials in Mexico City also said privately Cardenas wasexpected to win in the federal capital.   Cardenas has claimed national victory and Clouthier has claimedto be ahead in the vote. Both accuse the government and PRI offraud.   Salinas had claimed victory before any results were announced.   Monday's release of results provoked heated protests fromopposition members of the Federal Election Commission.   They contended at an open committee meeting that the count gavethe impression of a Salinas victory before the information had beenverified by district committees and the rest of the officialcomputing process.   Bartlett, the commission chairman, retorted: ``Public opiniondemands information. Let's give information.''   Officials said the commission still was receiving results fromdistrict commissions on elections for the Chamber of Deputies,which by law has precedence in counting over the Senate andpresidential races.   Partial official returns gave 170 of the 500 seats in the lowerhouse to the PRI, 13 to National Action Party and two to partiesthat support Cardenas.   Clouthier on Monday said irregularities in this year's electionsmade for ``the most fraudulent results in history.''   He the violations he alleged: last-minute changes of pollingplace locations; ink used to mark voters' thumbs was not indelible;brigades of voters who went from precinct to precinct, and peopleallowed to vote without showing credentials.   Clouthier asked a nationwide referendum be held July 30-31 onthe validity of the elections.   The main source of frustration in the slow count was theelection commission's promise before the voting that returns wouldbe reported the same day. Officials said the commission's computerbroke down late Wednesday and has not been used since.   Districts began their official counts at midnight Saturday, atime set by law.   Opposition parties kept vigils outside district offices and theFederal Election Commision in Mexico City in an effort to preventmanipulation of the results.   Even officials of the PRI, which has controlled the majorgovernment offices since its founding in 1929, acknowledge thecount is unusually slow. Their excuses includes the computerproblem, weather and a large turnout.   Three theories have emerged about what has gone wrong: fightingwithin the PRI, negotiations with the opposition and fraud by thegoverning party.   Bartlett was an important rival of Salinas for the presidentialnomination. Salinas, one of the party's young ``technocrats,'' hassaid he prefers a smaller margin of victory that is credible, butthe old guard is said to favor maintaining the party's usual 70percent or so by whatever means necessary.   A backstage tradeoff, perhaps an acceptance of Salinas' victoryin exchange for more opposition congressional seats, would be atypical PRI tactic. A close associate of Salinas said there hadbeen ``conversations'' but not negotiations. Clouthier and Cardenassay they would not make such trades.   Fraud by the PRI and government has been common in Mexicanelection despite laws officials say are designed to guard againstcheating.   The strong opposition vote and post-election mobilization todemand that it be respected reflect a political awakening in Mexico.   Cardenas and Clouthier have urged that protests be peaceful andlegal unless the authorities provoke violence.</TEXT></DOC>
