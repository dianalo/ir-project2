(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A sophisticated test that allowsdetection of minute amounts of the AIDS virus in people who byconventional tests appear uninfected is being offered commerciallyby two California laboratories.   The test uses a technique called polymerase chain reaction, orPCR, in which extremely small amounts of genetic material can bepicked out and quickly copied to provide enough material foranalysis.   It has been used in rare cases to identify people carrying smallamounts of the AIDS virus but who tested negative on conventionaltests.   The PCR test does not detect only AIDS, but any tiny amounts ofgenetic material. It has previously been available only forresearch.   Cetus Corp., which developed the technique, on Wednesdayannounced it has licensed the Pathology Institute in Berkeley andSpecialty Laboratories Inc. in Santa Monica to use the test.Physicians or laboratories will be able to send them blood samplesfor testing, which takes five days and costs about $145.   The PCR technique is not intended to replace the standard ELISAtest, which detects antibodies to the acquired immune deficiencysyndrom virus.   In many cases, the AIDS virus does not trigger production ofantibodies for six months or more after the infection has occurred.</TEXT></DOC>
