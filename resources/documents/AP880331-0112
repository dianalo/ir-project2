The Soviet-led alliance's seven foreign ministers also saidWednesday after a two-day meeting in the Bulgarian capital of Sofiathat the superpowers should agree to abide by the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Moscow says the treaty barsdevelopment of a space-based missile defense system.   The Warsaw Pact foreign ministers urged NATO to begin talks thisyear on reducing conventional forces in Europe and backed down froma longstanding position by offering separate negotiations onbattlefield nuclear weapons.   The offer appeared aimed at overcoming a more than year-oldabsence of movement toward new talks on reducing conventionalforces across Europe.   ``We welcome the statements of the Warsaw Pact foreign ministers... to the extent that they seem to reflect some of the concerns ofNATO members,'' said a NATO statement released today in Brussels,Belgium.   The statement added that it was important that the Warsaw Pact'swords be translated into concrete proposals at the negotiatingtable.   The appeals, published by the Bulgarian news agency BTA andmonitored in Vienna, indicated Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachevis eager to seal a pact on intercontinental nuclear missiles butnot insisting it be ready to sign when he meets President Reagan inMoscow May 29 to June 2.   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vadim Loginov told journalists inSofia that the Kremlin still hopes the agreement can be signedduring the Moscow summit.   But the Warsaw Pact statement indicated Moscow links a pact onstrategic arms to adherence to the 1972 ABM treaty, which setslimits on superpower missile defenses.   The Reagan administration has argued that the ABM accord permitsresearch and testing of the its space-based missile defenseproject, popularly called ``Star Wars.'' Moscow insists the ABMaccord rules out any such system.   The Warsaw Pact statement said talks on what the 16-nationsNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization calls conventional stabilityshould begin this year, but set no time for the separatenegotations on tactical nuclear and dual capability weapons.   East-West disagreement over how to count Warsaw Pact and NATOtroop levels has stalled Vienna talks on reducing conventionalforces in central Europe since they opened in 1973. Thosenegotations are likely to be wound down if new talks onconventional stability are started.   Agreement on new talks on conventional forces may pave the wayfor settlement of other disputes, including human rights issues.</TEXT></DOC>
