The folksback home aren't mincing words in letting congressmen know theythink it's a terrible idea.   ``Don't you dare let the salary increase go through,'' said atelegram to Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who opposes the raise.Another letter-writer said the issue ``has my hair on fire.''   ``Can't Congress do the same as ordinary people do?'' asked aletter to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who also voted against theraise on Thursday. ``Tighten their belts, spend less on luxuries andpleasures and still enjoy life,'' the writer advised.   ``I have never received such vicious mail,'' said Rep. BillRichardson, D-N.M. He said constituents were promising to voteagainst him even if the pay raise took effect over his objections.   Ed Senn, an aide to Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, a leading opponent ofthe pay increase, said the letters were pouring in.   ``If you stack them up they would be knee-deep,'' Senn said,adding that the letters differ from the form letters congressmentypically get when they are considering tax and banking issues.``This is different because it's not preprinted post cards. It's theheartfelt, handwritten letters.''   The raise in lawmakers' pay to $135,000 from the current $89,500will automatically take effect next Wednesday unless the Housefollows the Senate's lead in rejecting it. House Speaker Jim Wright,D-Texas, hopes both houses will roll the raise back to 30 percentthe next day, but some congressmen have said they would rather workto repeal it altogether.   Some of the constituent letters are as simple as President Bush'spromise not to raise taxes: ``Read my lips! No 50 percent payraise,'' said one note to Humphrey. Another said, ``Just say no topay raise. The thought of it is ridiculous.''   ``The taxpayer is rightfully enraged,'' one Arizonan wrote toMcCain. An elderly person wrote, ``I have worked, scrapped and savedall my life, the good old American way. Or so we've been told.''   And, one letter-writer urged congressmen to ``show some backbone.Display the courage that you all claimed you had during thecampaign.''   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said he realizes much of his mailopposes his stand in favor of the raise. Dodd wants to ban honorariaand raise the salary to $125,300, which is the total of the current$89,500 pay and the maximum amount of honoraria senators now mayaccept for making speeches.   ``No one likes to be against your constituency or appear to beagainst your constituents,'' Dodd said. ``But I happen to believethat you should be honest and straightforward and vote for thesethings.''   Many people do not understand that senators now supplement theirpay by accepting honoraria from special-interest groups, Dodd said,adding that he tries to explain to them he prefers that congressmenget a straight salary instead of taking money from those groups.   Humphrey spokeswoman Lisa Lyons said the pay raise mail is notthe heaviest her office has received on a single subject. Thecontroversy over former President Reagan's nomination of Robert Borkto the Supreme Court brought in many more letters, she said.   One New Hampshire resident wrote a five-stanza poem to Humphreythat included this gem: ``While you work hard to save a dime, sosome can feel carefree. The deficit is another thing, to worry youand me.''   Tauke said his mail included only a few backing a pay raise, butthey came from ``good friends who want me to have a raise. Be kindto your child,'' he said the letters advised him.</TEXT></DOC>
