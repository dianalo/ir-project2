The Commerce Department said total orders jumped to a seasonallyadjusted $123.1 billion last month. The big jump follows a huge 7.4percent decline in July, the biggest in more than four years, andan 8.7 percent increase in June, which was the largest in 30 months.   Orders for transportation equipment in August were up by 20.9percent to $35.4 billion. More than half the increase was for motorvehicles and parts. Auto orders had been weak in July as factorieswere switching over to a new model year.   That follows a 22.4 percent plunge in July and a 33.3 percentgain in June. The transportation category has been buffeted backand forth in recent months by big swings in orders for aircraft,ships and tanks.   Orders for defense goods jumped 15.3 percent in August to $8.1billion, following a 49.4 percent drop in July and a 68.3 percentincrease in June. This category, which is also very volatile frommonth to month, overlaps transportation and includes militaryplanes, tanks and ships.   Excluding defense goods, orders rose 5.4 percent last monthfollowing a decline of 2.2 percent in July and an increase of 4.2percent in June.   Excluding transportation, orders rose 1.0 percent in August,fell 0.9 percent in July and rose 0.7 percent in June.   Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods, a goodbarometer of business expansion plans, were up 5.4 percent inAugust to $38.2 billion, following gains of 2.2 percent in July and12.5 percent in June. This has been one of the strongest areas ofthe economy as manufacturers gear up to meet a boom in export sales.   Orders for primary metals such as steel fell 1.6 percent inAugust, following small declines in July and June.   Orders for the machinery category which includes computers rose4.2 percent in August after falling 2.9 percent a month earlier.Other kinds of electrical machinery were off 0.4 percent after a3.2 percent gain in July.
