Police ordered about 5,000 investigators to remain on indefinitealert and to arrest leftists, said the Seoul newspaper Chosun Ilbo.   Riots broke out after the tough measures were announced.Authorities said about 3,400 students, hurling firebombs and rocks,battled riot police today outside campuses in four cities.   President Roh Tae-woo on Wednesday ordered security forces tocrack down on radicals and dissidents, calling them a major threatto political stability.   ``All government offices must cooperate to root out the violentand destructive acts of leftists attempting to overthrow thegovernment,'' a presidential spokesman quoted Roh as tellingsecurity officials.   The government said it was allowing police to carry guns and usethem in self-defense in response to mounting firebomb attacks onpolice stations.   The country's police have until now rarely carried guns, normallyusing only tear gas and shields to defend themselves.   Senior government officials, who declined to be furtheridentified, said U.S.-built semi-automatic M-16s were issued todayto police.   Opposition parties charged that the move only would aggravateunrest. Issuing M-16s was ``tantamont to declaring a war against thepeople,'' the Reunification Democratic Party said in a statement.   On Monday, Roh announced that he was postponing indefinitely anational referendum on his performance that he had promised beforehis election.   He blamed the postponement on threats from radical groups anddiscord over how to hold the referendum.   But there were indications Roh might have difficulty winning avictory in the referendum and could be pressured into calling newelections. Many South Koreans are critical of the government forfailing to sever links with Roh's authoritarian predecessor, formerPresident Chun Doo-hwan.   Radicals have staged numerous violent anti-government protests,but they have little support and are not seen as a threat togovernment stability. Roh reportedly is under pressure fromgovernment hardliners to end the protests.   Prosecutor-General Kim Gi-chun followed Roh's directive byissuing orders today for a nationwide crackdown on all pro-NorthKorean activities.   He ordered the seizure of pro-North Korean publications, theclosure of private institutes used by radical groups to spreadcommunist ideology and the arrest of people using firebombs toattack government facilities.   Many radicals have leftist leanings but deny supporting NorthKorea.   The three main opposition parties, which control the NationalAssembly, agreed today to call a parliamentary hearing on thefirearms order.   The largest opposition party, the Party for Peace and Democracy,said in a statement today: ``We strongly oppose the use of firearms.The only way to restore social and political stability is tocontinue democratic reforms.''   The largest dissident group, the United National DemocraticMovement, called on the government to withdraw the decision, callingit ``an open threat to democratic forces.''   Thousands of students staged violent protests around campusestoday in Seoul and three other cities. In Seoul, riot police stoppedabout 800 students who tried to march out of Sejong University todemand Roh' ouster.   In Suwon, about 700 students armed with hundreds of firebombsbattled riot police for three hours, denouncing Roh's order,according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap. At least fivestudents and three police were injured, Yonhap said.   Yonhap also reported violent anti-government protests in Taejonand Kwangju where about 2,200 students hurled about 1,200 firebombsat riot police, who responded with barrages of tear gas.</TEXT></DOC>
