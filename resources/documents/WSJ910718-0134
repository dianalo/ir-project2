The Labor Department said theconsumer price index for June, minus the volatile food andenergy components, rose 0.4%. That was a larger increase inthe so-called &quot;core rate&quot; of inflation than most economistshad expected. The overall consumer price index rose a moremodest 0.2%, reflecting falling food and energy prices.   Housing starts in June increased 5.2% to an annual rate of1.04 million units, far above the 1.8% increase that had beenpredicted. What's more, May housing starts, originallyreported to have risen a scant 0.1%, were revised to show amuch stronger 1.2% increase.   In recent weeks, signs of a sluggish recovery had pushedinterest rates lower. But yesterday's reports rekindled fearsof rising inflation.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices slipped in active trading. Big Board volumetotaled 194.2 million shares.                                                                                                          Bond prices fell. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year issuelost nearly half a point, or nearly $5 for each $1,000 faceamount. The yield on the issue rose to 8.49%.                                                                                                          The dollar dropped.
