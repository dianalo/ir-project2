The official's remarks, delivered after the first day ofthe final round of the so-called Structural ImpedimentsInitiative, contrasted with the harsh rhetoric coming out ofWashington in the weeks leading up to the meetings. Lastweek, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said, &quot;Japan'sfoot-dragging . . . must end.&quot;   The most contentious issue is whether Japan will commit tobig increases in public spending over the next decade, an actthe U.S. argues will shift more resources to Japan's domesticmarket. A member of the U.S. delegation said the two sideswere still &quot;apart&quot; on the issue but &quot;I would not say we arefar apart.&quot;   A Japanese government official said his delegation didn'tincrease its proposal from the 415 trillion yen ($2.679trillion) level given to the U.S. last week. The U.S. hasasked Japan to spend 500 trillion yen over the next 10 yearson public works.                                                                                                          GLOBAL JET DEMAND                                                                                                          Global demand for commercial jets will total about 12,220planes for the period from 1990 through 2008, according to anew forecast published by Airbus Industrie. The Europeanconsortium said that about 5,500 aircraft of the estimatedtotal would be needed to replace aging jets now in service.The rest would be needed to satisfy traffic growth estimatedat an annual average of 5.5% for the period. Airbus estimatedfirm orders had already been placed for some 3,200 jets bythe start of 1990.                                                                                                          AMERICAN EXPRESS IN LONDON                                                                                                          American Express Co. will lease space for a Europeanheadquarters from Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd. in theCanary Wharf office complex in East London. The U.S. traveland financial-services concern said it will take 300,000square feet of 20 Cabot Square, a 10-story building, inspring 1992. The new building will be the first Europeanheadquarters for American Express International, bringingabout 1,500 employees under one roof, American Express said.Olympia andamp; York said it now has leasing commitments for morethan half the space under construction at Canary Wharf.                                                                                                          BRAZILIAN KIDNAPPINGS                                                                                                          The Brazilian government has proposed drastic measures toput an end to a wave of kidnappings. Kidnappers have seized25 people in Rio de Janeiro alone this year. &quot;The governmentmust take vigorous and drastic measures to cut off this evilat the root,&quot; said President Fernando Collor de Mello in amemorandum to Justice Minister Bernardo Cabral. Measuresproposed to the legislature include freezing the assets ofvictims to stop them from paying ransom and increasing themaximum prison sentence for kidnappers to 30 years fromeight.                                                                                                          AIRPORT SECURITY                                                                                                          Japan plans to tighten luggage security checks at its sixinternational airports beginning in October, a TransportMinistry spokesman said. The ministry is negotiating to splitcosts with a number of airlines that don't X-ray luggage onflights to and from Japan, the spokesman said. Elsewhere, theGeneva-based International Air Travel Association said itopposed a West German plan to levy a $2 security charge onembarking airline passengers. &quot;We firmly believe that thecost of maintaining security at airports . . . should beborne by the state in question,&quot; said an IATA official.                                                                                                          JOINT VENTURES IN EASTERN EUROPE                                                                                                          A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment shows that there are more than 5,400 jointventures with foreign companies in Eastern Europe. But alarge number of these, especially in the Soviet Union, are&quot;just on paper and inactive&quot;; and, in general, the jointventures are noticeably absent from the service sector, anOECD official said. He added that &quot;while many joint projectshave had a useful demonstration effect, some countries haveto rebuild their legal and economic infrastructure&quot; beforemany ventures can bear fruit.
