The accord prevented a flare-up of trade tensions between the U.S. and EC, as both sides said yesterday that they have dropped threats of trade retaliation over the pasta issue.    The EC Commission agreed yesterday to a formula intended to eliminate subsidies on half of the pasta exported to the U.S. and reduce subsidies on the remaining half, initially by 27.5%. The community last year exported to the U.S. pasta valued at 29.7 million European currency units ($32.8 million), and holds 5% of the U.S. market.    The accord was reached by U.S. and EC negotiators on Tuesday. It still needs formal approval by the EC member states, but a spokesman for the EC Commission said he expects no obstacles to ratification tomorrow. Another commission official said initial reaction from the ambassadors of the EC states was favorable, although Italy wanted to discuss the accord with representatives of its pasta industry before giving its assent tomorrow.    The U.S. had pressed for a complete elimination of the pasta subsidies, claiming that they violate free-trade rules under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Gary Holmes, a spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, yesterday said the U.S. &quot;didn't get everything we wanted,&quot; but he added that the U.S. would demand further concessions from the EC during the current Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations under the GATT.    In the meantime, the U.S. has agreed to drop attempts to use the GATT's enforcement procedures in its efforts to make the EC eliminate pasta subsidies.    The EC has long maintained that it isn't under any obligation under international trade rules to modify its pasta subsidies. A commission official involved in the negotiations said, however, that the EC decided to make concessions in part because of concern that the U.S. Congress will pass a protectionist trade bill. He said the commission hoped the pasta accord would help reduce U.S.-EC trade tensions.    The agreement makes it more likely that Congress will now ratify a U.S.-EC accord reached a year ago on trade in citrus fruit. The U.S. has said that congressional ratification of the citrus accord depended on a solution to the pasta dispute.    The pasta agreement is scheduled to be phased in gradually beginning in October. Under the accord, EC pasta makers will have the option of importing U.S. durum wheat, without paying the EC's high import levy, to use in making pasta. The pasta manufactured from U.S. wheat may then be exported to the U.S. without subsidy.    Officials said that the target is for 50% of EC pasta exports to the U.S. to use this system, and the subsidy on the remaining exports will be varied to see that this target is met.    The EC spokesman said community pasta makers already import significant quantities of U.S. wheat to use in pasta and that it wasn't clear what impact the agreement would have on EC imports. EC figures show that in 1986 the EC imported 138,000 metric tons of durum wheat from the U.S., with a value of 24.8 million ECUs, much of it for use in pasta. </TEXT></DOC>
