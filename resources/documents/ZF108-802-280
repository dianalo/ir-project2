(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Intel's new 80486 microprocessor packs a lot of power for numericallyintensive applications.andP;  But until prices come down and 486-specific softwarebecomes a reality, a cautious buying approach seems warranted.andM;As personal computers based on the 80486 microprocessor from SantaClara-based Intel Corp. start to trickle out, is decision makers seem prettyclear about where they think the 486-based machines will fit into theirorganizations now and over the next few years.andP;  Only a few of them are movingquickly to embrace the 486 in large numbers, at least for now.andM;Companies that are only after speed and power-particularly forcomputationally intensive applications-are buying 486s today, and their powergluttons are using the machines with glee.andP;  The reason to upgrade from a 386to a 486 seems obvious if you look at the choice purely from a powerperspective.andP;  According to Intel's own benchmarks based on integer andfloating point measurements, performance of a 486 falls somewhere between 1.5to twice times that of a 386 running at the same clock speed.andM;But many analysts contend that the speed of a 386 is more than adequate formost PC applications.andP;  They consider that the real leap forward inmicroprocessor technology occurred in 1986, with the long-awaitedintroduction of 386-based computers.andP;  At the time, the MS-DOS communityleaped from the 16-bit architecture of 80286-based PCs to the much faster32-bit architecture of the 80386.andP;  Those buying computers for more than rawcomputing power alone must ask some important questions before upgradingtheir 386 user base to 486 machines.andM;One essential question deals with price.andP;  At what point in the inevitableprice erosion cycle will the 486 be worth the performance gains? Although theissue of price/performance is never easy to quantify, 486 machines areclearly priced at a premium over high-end 386 PCs.andP;  Lower cost, bare-bones486 machines are starting to hit the market with price increases of $500 to$2,000 or more over their 386 counterparts.andP;  In time, the gap should narrow,as the price difference between 80286 and 80386sx machines has done.andM;But price is just part of the picture.andP;  Most potential 486 buyers are equallyconcerned about software.andP;  When will we see software that will truly exploitthe 32-bit technology of both the 386 and the 486 chips? Will that softwarebe more expensive' and harder to implement for 486s than for 386s? Afterasking these practical questions, most companies wind up taking aconservative, wait-and-see attitude toward the 486 machines.andM;Today, four years after the 386 introduction, users are still waiting for anew generation of software that fully takes advantage of the 32-bitarchitectures of either the 386 or 486.andP;  Although some software is appearingin the form of ms-DOS extenders such as Microsoft Windows 3.0 that break the640 kilobyte DOS memory barrier, most packages today do not take advantage ofthe newer chips beyond the obvious gain in speed.andP;  Where the 486 Stands OutandM;Even without 32-bit software, however, is professionals have three clearreasons for choosing the 486 today.andP;  First, the 486 is fully upwardlycompatible with the 386, so it will run any software that runs on the 386,including the MS-DOS, UNIX and os/2 operating systems.andP;  Second, the 486boasts a built-in, integrated, floating point numeric coprocessor.andP;  Achievingcomparable performance on a 386 machine requires the addition of the 80387coprocessor or an equivalent chip.andP;  Third, the 486 has a small internalmemory cache system that improves performance.andP;  What all this adds up to isat least double the processing speid for the 486 over its 386 sibling.andM;According to manufacturers, most 486 machines sold to date have been adoptedin two major areas: as network fileservers and as specialized,performance-sensitive applications such as software development andcomputer-aided design and engineering (CAD/CAE).andP;  For the most part, theseare the same applications for which the 386 machines were initially targetedfour years ago.andP;  The inevitable reduction in price, however, has driven the386 into the mainstream of business computing.andM;One response to the need for a 486 is characterized by Terence Colligan,president of Rational Systems Inc., a Natick, Mass-based software developer.andO;&quot;The 486 was purely a speed purchase.andP;  It wasn't a lot more expensive thanthe 386 system we had, and it was almost twice as fast for the work we weredoing.andP;  &quot;andM;Still, most manufacturers and users do not believe the 486 machines willbecome general purpose PCs for quite a while.andP;  In act , they see the machinesfitting into the very high end of the PC envelope and nosing their way intoareas where dedicated engineering workstations and even minicomputers are theusual fare.andP;  For example, a fully configured 486-based system, optimized forCAD applications, costs between $10,000 and $15,000.andP;  That is minimal whencompared with the cost of a traditional dedicated engineering workstation,says Pradeep jatwani, marketing manager of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s NorthAmerican PC division in Sunnyvale, Calif.andM;A Niche MarketandM;Rick Eder, information technology coordinator at Rochester, N.Y.-basedEastman Kodak Co., believes that, right now, there is a place for eachprocessor, and each processor has its place.andP;  He says the capailities of the486 chip, primarily its caching and integration with the floating pointcoprocessor, are suitable for numerically intensive engineering and researchapplications.andP;  The 486 will also find a niche in the emerginghigh-performance fileserver market, he says.andM;Eder does not believe the average desktop user needs 486 capabilities, atleast not yet.andP;  For many business applications, the 386 chip is sufficientbecause it supplies the 32-bit architecture needed to run tomorrow'sapplications.andM;In its engineering area, Kodak has several 486 machines that are being usedspecifically for high-end CAD/CAE applications.andP;  The firm also evaluated thefileserver market where, says Eder, many of the offerings are 486-based.andO;Price is also a factor with Eder when evaluating 486 machines.andP;  In the CADarena, he says, the machines are starting to show up in an affordable range.andO;&quot;We are going for the right performance for the right price and for the rightapplication at this point.andP;  That's the way we see it divided up.andM;Waiting it OutandM;Noxell Corp., a manufacturing firm in Hunt Valley, Md., is just beginning toevaluate 486 machines.andP;  john Kusik, Noxell's manager of systems planning,says most of his firm's machines are of the 386 and 286 persuasion.andP;  Kusik iscautious about 486 computers and is waiting for the bugs to be worked out.andO;Some of the early, 486s brought in were having problems with the smallcomputer systems interface (scsi) controllers, he says.andM;Kusik says that if Noxell's users demonstrate a real need for 486s, he mayget them.andP;  But he doesn't see much of a need at this point.andP;  His power users,who mostly use spreadsheet applications, are getting by with 386 machines.andO;Where Kusik sees the 486 eventually failing into place at Noxell is incertain graphically intensive applications and as network servers.andM;Another firm that is not jumping too quickiy on the 486 bandwagon is New YorkCity-based accounting and consulting giant Ernst andamp; Young.andP;  According to RickRichardson, the firm's director of technology, Ernst andamp; Young is sticking withthe 386, at least for now.andP;  Few Ernst andamp; Young power users need 486 PCsimmediately, says Richardson.andP;  And until prices come down and the 486 emergesas more of a commodity, migrating to the 486 is not going to be a big issue.andO;Richardson also says his firm has few users doing CAD/CAM orcompute-intensive kinds of applications where a 486 would be the way to go.andM;Bill Laurence, technology manager at the San Onofre Nuclear Power Station inSan Onofre, Callf., says he, too, sees no ultra-compelling reason to migratefrom the 386 to the 486.andP;  Although some of his CAD users have the newmachines, he says the benefits in most cases don't seem to be significant.andO;Laurence sees a streak of conservatism evident in is purchasing these days.andO;He claims many is managers want other companies to wrestle first with new andtricky applications before they commit to the technology.andM;He also feels the lack of software plays a role in the slow adoption of the486.andP;  For example, he says if a 486 version of AutoCAD were marketed today(Sausalito, Calif.-based Autodesk Inc. does have a 386 version of itsproduct) he would be buying a lot more 486 machines.andP;  The Fileservers AreComingandM;Despite vendor insistence that 486 machines are being used as networkfileservers, most IS executives have yet to actually implement the machinesin this way.andM;Barry Livingstone, chairman of the 486 Standardization Committee of the NewYork Micro Managers Association, has been testing a 486 as a networkfileserver despite the lack of networking software.andP;  Livingstone calls thesituation a catch-22.andP;  The manufacturers of networking software, he says, arestarting to develop 486-specific  features in their software, for which theywill charge a premium.andP;  But, as of today, those features are just notavailable.andM;&quot;One manufacturer of network software charges you more if the system isrunning on a 486.andP;  They have a [486 recognition] feature in their code, andunless that feature is enabled by the manufacturer, the code will not run.andO;Yet you have to pay them the extra fee,&quot; he says.andP;  According to Livingston,some vendors charge extra for 486 software extensions that, as yet, deliverno added functions.andM;Livingstone says users want proof that the 486's performance increases willoutweigh the increase in price over the 386.andP;  &quot;The 486 [machine] is not goingto look any faster to the user if it doesn't really take advantage of any 486[microprocessor] features&quot;' he says.andM;Still, despite all the debates of the merits of the 486 versus 386microprocessors-all of the balancing and measuring of price, performance,operating systems, applications software and networking environments-there isone issue that all is professionals are very clear about.andP;  The day will come,probably in no less than five years and no more than 10, when 486 machineswill be at the lower end of the PC market.andM;At that point, although is decision makers will be upstream from where theyare today, they'll still be caught in a similar tidal pool.andP;  The 486 will bethe mainstream chip, and they will be trying to figure out where the 586, thex86 and beyond, will fit best into their computing environments.andM;Emily Leinfuss is a freelance writer based in Sarasota, Fla.andM;A Vote in Favor of the 486andM;One technology manager who sees a large need today for 80486 machines isKeith Fietcher, network administrator at Warner Lambert Co., apharmaceuticals company based in Morris Plains, Nj.andP;  Fletcher is testingvarious 496 machines for speed, compatibility and price.andP;  Eventually he plansto use the machines as fileservers, but currently his firm is testing 486s ondatabase-intensive applications and for some programming tasks.andM;Fletcher warns that the microprocessor alone is not the end-all when it comesto speed.andP;  He says he found that a 486, 25-megahertz machine is roughly asfast as a 386, 33MHz machine when running many applications.andP;  &quot;You justaren't going to get a whole lot more speed out of the 486 chip when the clockspeed is slower than the 386 chip,&quot; he contends.andP;  But the  newer 33  MHz 486chip-currently available in limited supply-does considerably  outperform the386 running at the same clock speed.andM;Fletcher feels that the 486, with its built-in coprocessor and memory cache,represents the first generation of superchips that are on the way.andP;  Already,fie is beginning to download mainframe database applications onto machinesusing the 486.andP;  &quot;Once you have this level of power on your desk, you caneasily work with large quantities of data, like the mainframe doe's,&quot; hesays.andM;Although Fletcher is curious about new software that will eventually takeadvantage of the 386 and the 486 chips, he needs more power for his usersright now.andP;  &quot;We need maximum power with existing software, so we are lookingfor the fastest processor we can get.andP;  Eventually'  we are going to havemaximum power with the new software, and that will be even better.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
