In a memo filed four days before North's sentencing, prosecutorsurged U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to consider North's``breach of public trust and misuse of public power, the destructiveeffect of his criminal behavior on the functioning of government ...his perjury and his total lack of remorse.''   A prison term would also help counteract the political appealthat North has gained on the lecture circuit _ a popularity thatprosecutors argued only ``reinforces his lack of remorse.''   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh charged that ``with supremefaith in his ability to deceive, North took the witness stand andperjured himself'' with a false story to explain away a charge thathe pocketed $4,300 in traveler's checks entrusted to him by a leaderof the Nicaraguan rebels.   ``His unsupported claim that he had a $15,000 fund in a steel boxin his closet echoed the flimsy lies offered by corrupt municipalofficials in the days of Tammany Hall,'' Walsh said.   ``North's attempt to use the steel box to explain his cashpurchase of a car in two installments graphically demonstratesNorth's penchant for weaving a tale that by its conclusion ispreposterous.''   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel faces a possible 10-yearsentence for aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress,destroying or mutilating government documents and accepting anillegal gratuity _ a $13,800 security system outside his home thatwas paid for by arms dealer Richard V. Secord.   North, 45, was acquitted of nine other counts, including a chargehe stole the traveler's checks.   Walsh did not make a specific recommendation of how many monthsor years North should serve in prison.   ``North's perjury represents another indication of his continuingcallous attitude toward the judicial process and our democraticinstitutions,'' Walsh said.   Despite this accusation, Walsh delivered an 11th-hour invitationto North to cooperate with his investigation and testify againstformer national security adviser John M. Poindexter and otherIran-Contra defendants.   ``The investigation of this office is not yet concluded. Despitehis dimninished credibility, North would still have a usefulness asa witness if he were prepared to take the steps appropriate to sucha course,'' Walsh wrote.   North's lawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., has not yet submitted asentencing memorandum of his own but is likely to do so soon.   Throughout the 12-page sentencing memorandum, Walsh repeated thetheme that ``North has not indicated one iota of remorse for crimeswhich, because of his position of public trust, jeopardized theconstitutional processes of government.''   ``The arrogance that characterized North's exercise of powerbefore the investigation has been the hallmark of his reaction tohis indictment and conviction,'' Walsh said, noting North's commentafter the May 4 verdict that his vindication was not complete.   ``Oliver North viewed and continues to view himself as beingabove the law and beyond reproach,'' Walsh said.   Walsh noted that during his testimony North said that ``not forone fleeting moment'' did he think he was doing anything wrong byhelping prepare a false chronology of U.S.-Iran arms sales to showcongressional investigators.   ``Certainly, he sees nothing wrong with lying to Congress, whenin view of himself and his superiors lying is necessary,'' theindependent counsel said.   Walsh said the retired Marine lieutenant colonel's ``lack ofremorse is particularly troubling in view of the fact that hecontinues to travel throughout the country, like a politician on thestump, giving speeches and discoursing on his defiance ofCongress,'' Walsh said.   ``The fact that this defendant is cultivating a popularfollowing, which reinforces his lack of remorse, makes it all themore important for the court to underscore the gravity of North'soffenses by imposing a term of incarceration,'' said Walsh.   The independent prosecutor also rejected the notion that North isa scapegoat.   ``He is a government official who must be held to account for thelegality and honesty of his own personal actions regardless ofwhether others may also have transgressed the law and regardless ofthe ends sought to be achieved,'' Walsh said.   Walsh also disputed North's suggestion at the trial that he wasacting with the authorization of higher officials in the Reaganadministration.   ``This society cannot tolerate government officials unwilling andunable to exercise independent judgment and responsibility inrefusing to perform illegal acts,'' Walsh said. The sentence shouldshow that ``one cannot simply rely on real or imagined authorizationof illegal conduct and expect to escape responsibility,'' Walsh said.   North's acceptance of the $13,800 security system from Secord, anIran-Contra co-defendant awaiting trial, shows ``venality infinancial matters.''   Letting North go free without imprisonment ``would send exactlythe wrong message to government officials and to the public,'' Walshsaid. ``It would be a statement that 15 years after Watergate,government officials can participate in a brazen cover-up, lie toCongress and collect a substantial gratuity and still receive only aslap on the wrist.''</TEXT></DOC>
