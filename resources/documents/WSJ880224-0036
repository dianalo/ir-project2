The venture is Merrill's first since it established its Merrill Lynch Teleport Technologies Inc. unit last December to make investments to build phone networks outside New York. Like other financial institutions, Merrill Lynch has become interested in the telecommunications business because so much of its basic securities business depends on having a reliable phone network.    Merrill is a 97% partner in Teleport Communications-New York, which has built 150 miles of fiber-optic lines in the New York metropolitan region used by Merrill and other New York concerns to bypass New York Telephone Co. Western Union Corp. owns the remaining 3% of Teleport-New York.    The Boston partners wouldn't say how much they will spend to build the Boston network. George Hertz, president of Fidelity Communications, the Fidelity unit that is the investor in the project, said it will build 30 to 40 miles of fiber-optic lines in the Boston area. Merrill and Fidelity will be initial customers of the venture, called Teleport Communications-Boston.    The teleport idea has caught on in other cities such as San Francisco, Chicago and Houston, where other ventures are building networks to compete with the local phone company. &quot;Any telecommunications-based business has got to have other networks available&quot; in case the local phone company's network goes down, said Mr. Hertz.    Analysts said such teleports aren't currently a major threat to local phone companies but could become threats as more big customers use them to hook into long distance companies. Mr. Hertz said plans call for the Boston venture to become profitable &quot;in a reasonable period of time,&quot; but wouldn't be more specific. </TEXT></DOC>
