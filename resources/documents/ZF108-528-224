 But CP/M was optimized for8-bit microprocessors.andP;  For its entry into the PC market, IBM wanted anoperating system for 16-bit microprocessors.andM;When IBM executives asked Microsoft founder Bill Gates to design this newoperating system for the emerging microcomputer market, neither party couldhave anticipated the potential magnitude of that market.andM;Initially targeted for machines running Intel's 16-bit 8088 microprocessor,the new Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS) addressed 1Mb of randomaccess memory--360K for housekeeping chores and 640K for runningapplications.andP;  Since typical applications at the time required 8K to 16K ofRAM, 640K was plenty of memory.andM;One year after announcing its MS-DOS-based personal computer, IBM has soldmore than 250,000 units.andP;  The anticipated market had been engineers andscientists.andP;  However, with the introduction of personal productivitysoftware, such as spreadsheet, word processing and database programs,professionals from other fields began buying the machines.andM;Just as the 8-bit operating system was supplanted by the 16-bit system, itwas not long before applications exceeded 640K.andP;  &quot;Our customers quickly haddifficulty running their spreadsheets in the available memory,&quot; said David P.andO;Reed, vice president and chief scientist for spreadsheets at LotusDevelopment Corp., Cambridge, Mass.andM;The advent of local area networks compounded the problem.andP;  Users beganconnecting their microcomputers to local area networks to send files toco-workers.andP;  &quot;Once a user loads all the device drivers needed to connect aDOS computer to a LAN, there is little room for applications,&quot; said DavidJensen, a managing partner at InfoSource Consulting Group in Dallas.andM;In addition to LANs, the introduction of the mouse, windowing software andcolor monitors took memory away from applications.andM;Vendors scurried to circumvent the 640K limitation.andP;  Three majorplayers--Lotus, Microsoft and Intel--outlined a standard called ExpandedMemory Specification (EMS), which addressed the 640K restriction.andP;  EMS usedhardware and software so microcomputers with Intel's 8088 microprocessorscould work with additional memory.andM;The EMS technique required a lot of work by software vendors.andP;  Ralph Young,executive vice president at RYBS Electronics Inc. in Boulder, Colo.,andO;explained, &quot;Applications had to be totally rewritten to take advantage of theextra memory.&quot;andP;  Consequently, EMS gained little market acceptance.andP;  &quot;EMS wasa kludgey method of letting 1-2-3 users work with large spreadsheets,&quot; saidTerrence Colligan, president of Rational Systems Inc. of Natick, Mass.andM;In 1985, RYBS found a way to use to full 1Mb of RAM available to DOS.andM;One technique to work with all available DOS memory is called DOS Extension.andO;With this technique, programs do not have to be rewritten.andM;For its Hicard line of DOS Extension products, RYBS developed a proprietaryApplication Program Interface (API), called Advanced Memory Specification,that addressed 1Mb of information.andM;According to RYBS' Young, the company has sold 100,000 copies of its Hicardproducts to both vendors and users over the past four years.andM;Vendors that have incorporated Hicard in their products include ATandamp;T andNovell Inc., a local area network company in Provo, Utah.andM;In early 1989, The University of California at Davis encountered problemswith a microcomputer database application.andP;  Margaret Messick, a programmeranalyst at the university's School of Medicine, said the university ranAshton-Tate's dBase IV database management system on a four-node LAN from3Com Corp., Mountain View, Calif.andP;  &quot;When we loaded the network adapter cardsand dBase IV, we did not have enough memory to run the applications,&quot; shesaid.andP;  When the university turned to Ashton-Tate of Terrence, Calif., foradvice, the software vendor recommended RYBS' products.andP;  In May, theuniversity served as a test site for a Micro Channel version of the Hicard.andM;The test, which was completed last fall, encountered a few problems.andO;&quot;Whenever problems occurred, other vendors were quick to blame the Hicard,&quot;Messick said.andP;  &quot;But it never was the source of any problem.&quot;andM;DOS Extension products only raise the limit for 640K to 1Mb of RAM, owing tolimitations of the first-generation Intel microprocessors.andM;In the mid-1980s, Intel announced the second generation of microprocessors,the 80286 adn 80386.andP;  These microprocessors were more powerful than theirolder siblings.andP;  In protected mode, the second-generation microprocessorsworked with 16Mb of RAM.andP;  They also supported multitasking, the ability tosimultaneously perform more than one function.andM;The &quot;protected mode&quot; is that portion of memory available to the operatingsystem to use above the limit of 640K that DOS can address.andM;The microprocessors were quickly incorporated into new microcomputers, and asecond technique to break the 640K barrier emerged.andM;The technique, called DOS Extender, provides an interface between anapplication and DOS operating system services.andP;  The extender runs in the DOSoperating system kernel and switches to protected mode processing to takeadvantage of the 16Mb of memory available with 80286 and 80386microprocessors.andM;Three companies, Eclipse Computer Solutions Inc. in  Peabody, Mass., Phar LapSoftware Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., and Rational Systems, sell most of the DOSExtenders, which are primarily sold to software developers.andP;  To date, morethan 300 applications have been tailored to take advantage of the additionalmemory.andM;The success caught some suppliers by surprise.andP;  In 1985, Rational was sellingmicrocomputer programming languages and bumped against DOS' memorylimitation.andP;  To circumvent the problem, the company designed a DOS Extendercalled DOS/16M.andP;  &quot;As we demonstrated our programming languages to othersuppliers, they asked if we would sell our DOS Extender to them,&quot; Colligansaid.andM;In early 1987, the company honored the request.andP;  &quot;OS/2 was scheduled to shipat the end of the year, so we thought we hade a market opportunity that wouldlast approximately six months,&quot; Colligan confessed.andM;Three years later, the window remains wide open.andP;  Rational claimed that 150vendors have licensed DOS/16M.andP;  In 1989, revenue increased to $4 million.andM;Lotus helped to spur the increase in Rational's revenue.andP;  In the summer of1989, the software vendor shipped release 3 of its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet.andO;The application uses DOS/16M to access 16Mb of RAM.andP;  (Lotus later bought aminority stake in Rational.)andM;Last September, DataEase International Inc. in Trumbull, Conn., shippedversion 4.2 of its database management system, also called DataEase.andP;  Thecompany used Rational's DOS/16M to address 16Mb of information.andP;  (Version 4.2revision 3 was released in February.)andM;Joel Richmond, a PC Coordinator at GE Aerospace Corp. in Burlington, Mass.,andO;found that the new version of DataEase solved one longstanding problem.andP;  &quot;Anumber of database applications require more than 640K of memory,&quot; heexplained.andP;  &quot;We tested other techniques, such as EMS cards, but found thatthey were difficult to install.andP;  Installation of the new release of DataEasewas simple.andP;  Many users don't even know they are working with an extender,and they no longer run into any memory problems.&quot;andM;Large vendors have also begun dabbling with DOS Extenders.andP;  In February,Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., announced server software thattransforms DOS microcomputers into X Window terminals.andP;  DEC's software relieson Rational's DOS/16M.andM;DEC would seem to be a likely customer for Phar Lap Software, which hassuccessfully sold its 386/ASM/Link line of DOS Extender products to computervendors.andP;  Clients include hardware suppliers IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co. andPrime Computer Inc., as well as software companies Autodesk Inc. and BorlandInternational Inc.andM;On the other hand, Eclipse Computer Solutions sees programming languagevendors as its prime market.andP;  The company's first DOS Extender customer, GoldHill Computers Inc., Cambridge, Mass., needed extra memory to support itsartificial intelligence programming language.andP;  This sale was a relief forEclipse management.andP;  &quot;The market was risky because many vendors saw theproduct as fitting only a narrow, esoteric niche,&quot; said Fred Hewett, vicepresident of software development at Eclipse.andM;The company packages its extenders, OS/286 and OS/386, as part of a softwaredevelopment kit.andP;  &quot;Customers receive a DOS Extender, a programming languageand debugging tools, which they can use to develop new applications,&quot; Hewettsaid.andM;MIXED RESULTS FOR USERSandM;Despite growing popularity, DOS Extender products are not a panacea.andP;  Theyrun only on Intel 80286 or 80386 machines and require that users purchase alot of additional memory.andP;  Because DOS programs have to be rewritten to takeadvantage of the additional memory, the products are geared to softwaredevelopers rather than users.andP;  For users who have worked with the products,the results have been mixed.andM;In early 1989, The Art Institute of Chicago purchased Rational's DOS/16M.andO;Karl Pinc, the assistant director of data processing, said the institutesupported a database application that was stretching the 640K barrier.andM;&quot;Tailoring our application to run with a DOS Extender was a pain in thebutt,&quot; Pinc said.andP;  &quot;A programmer constantly has to worry about allocating anddeallocating memory.andP;  If an application requires additional memory, it shouldjust go and get it.&quot;andM;Instead of using DOS Extenders, the Art Institute, which supportsapproximately 50 microcomputers, is porting its database applications toApple Computer Inc. Macintosh personal computers.andP;  &quot;A Macintosh approach ischeaper and easier to implement than a DOS solution,&quot; said Pinc.andM;Not all users find the programming task cumbersome, however.andP;  John HancockMutual Life Insurance Inc. in Boston wanted to install an applicationrequiring 2Mb of RAM at its field offices, according to Brian Moody, a seniormanager.andP;  In early 1989, John Hancock purchased Rational's DOS/16M.andP;  Moodysaid that porting the application went smoothly.andP;  Last fall, the companybegan a pilot test of the software at 10 offices.andM;This spring, John Hancock began rolling out the application to other fieldoffices; it may run in as many as 250 field offices by year-end.andM;In addition to requiring programming expertise, DOS Extenders raise otherissues.andP;  The products were designed for the single-tasking DOS operatingsystem and pose problems when used in multitasking environments.andP;  Thislimitation has sparked a controversy.andM;DOS Extenders rely on Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI), a standardinterface that allows multiple DOS Extender applications to operatesimultaneously.andM;In its forthcoming Windows 3.0 graphic user interface for DOS, MicrosoftCorporation, Redmond, Wash., has taken a different approach to breaking the640K limitation.andP;  The company used a proprietary specification, DOS ProtectedMode Interface (DPMI).andM;As expected, DOS Extender suppliers were unhappy when DPMI was unveiled.andO;Many felt they should have been consulted as Microsoft designed thespecification.andM;Microsoft insisted that DPMI filled a different void than VCPI, and hence noinput was needed.andM;Mark Chestnut, program manager for MS-DOS at Microsoft, said, &quot;VCPI provideda good solution in a single-tasking operating system.andP;  Microsoft needed astandard for multitasking operating systems, such as OS/2 and a futureversion of Windows.andP;  DPMI addressed that issue.&quot;andM;Unlike VCPI, DPMI was designed for a multitasking operating system.andP;  DPMIprovides a bullet-proof multitasking API, meaning no problems arise ifseveral applications share a single hardware device, such as a monitor.andP;  VCPIis not bullet-proof.andM;A PEACE TALKandM;In February 1990, Intel tried to play peacemaker by inviting the feudingvendors to a meeting.andP;  The vendors agreed to form a committee to determinehow to integrate the VCPI and the DPMI standards.andM;The participants agreed that the meeting put an end to the controversy.andP;  &quot;Iwas surprised at the degree of compromise that vendors exhibited during themeeting,&quot; said Reed of Lotus.andP;  &quot;All worked toward the same goal, so we wereable to reach a conclusion.&quot;andM;The compromise may enable DOS Extender manufacturers to broaden theirmarkets.andP;  One meeting participant, who preferred not to be named, said thecompromise should provide compatibility between Windows and VCPI, so that auser could load Windows and call up 1-2-3-release 3 within a window.andP;  Whilethe timing is by no means certain, this participant projected that a revisedWindows product could be delivered by year-end.andP;  The pressure is on todeliver, since the participants fear market stagnation if users slow downproduct purchases until the issue is resolved.andM;Eclipse's Hewett said, &quot;Windows version 4 will be a popular developmentplatform that no vendor can ignore.andP;  We obviously want our applications to beavailable there.&quot;andM;The acceptance of Windows and DOS Extenders created a bit of a dilemma forMicrosoft.andP;  The popularity of the products may slow the migration to OS/2.andO;Ironically, OS/2 was designed to overcome many of DOS's limitations.andP;  OS/2addresses 16Mb of RAM, supports multitasking multiprocessors and works wellon LANs.andP;  When OS/2 was announced, many analysts predicted a swift death forDOS.andP;  As OS/2 reaches its third anniversary, sales remain well below initialexpectations.andM;Observers presented other reasons why the migration to OS/2 is slow.andP;  Youngat RYBS said, &quot;DOS Extension products are having a major impact on the OS/2market.andP;  They are providing DOS with extended life because they offer many ofthe benefits of OS/2 and none of the problems.&quot;andM;A prime reason for OS/2's lack of progress is a dearth of applications thattake advantage of the new operating system.andP;  DOS Extenders and DOS Extensionproducts seem to have taken at least some developers' attention away fromOS/2.andM;&quot;An application programmer must learn a new set of APIs to design an OS/2application,&quot; said Hewett.andP;  &quot;With a DOS Extender, the programmer uses thesame APIs and can more easily determine how to take advantage of theadditional memory.&quot;andM;Users seem leery of moving to the new operating system.andP;  &quot;We have no reasonto look at a new operating system,&quot; explained GE Aerospace's Richmond.andP;  &quot;Ourapplications are up and running now.andP;  We don't want to fool around with a newoperating system that may cause us many problems.&quot;andM;But OS/2 has a growing list of supporters.andP;  Peter Privateer, director ofproduct programs at KnowledgeWare Inc., a Case software company in Atlanta,said, &quot;We are moving forward with our OS/2 development efforts.andP;  Last year,IBM outlined its plans for AD/Cycle and made it clear that the company iscommitted to OS/2.&quot;andM;In December 1989, KnowledgeWare shipped OS/2 versions of its Case tools.andO;Analysts expect other software companies to deliver OS/2 applications thisyear.andM;The first Case tool under OS/2 may have been Case:PM from Caseworks, Inc.,andO;Atlanta, which was announced at Comdex in April 1989.andP;  Approximately 1,600units had shipped by year-end, according to Joseph Richburg, Caseworkspresident.andP;  Of those, 60% were for Presentation Manager and the rest froWindows, he stated.andM;Richburg predicts OS/2 eventually will be widely installed.andP;  &quot;OS/2 takesbetter advantage of the machine and of the people,&quot; he stated.andM;The ability of OS/2 to set aside a separate processing thread for eachapplication, and to have the applications process simultaneously, is aprimary reason for this, Richburg said.andP;  &quot;Anything that takes over 10milliseconds should have its own thread,&quot;andM;Even detractors admitted that OS/2 offers capabilities not found in DOS, suchas support for LAN connections.andP;  &quot;OS/2 will emerge as the dominant operatingsystem for companies building corporate-wide, cooperative processingapplications,&quot; said Reed of Lotus Development Corp.andP;  &quot;But DOS will continueto be used on standalone microcomputers.&quot;andM;A few vendors said that DOS Extenders may eventually aid in the migration toOS/2.andP;  There is a gap between DOS' maximum configuration, 640K and OS/2'sminimum, estimated at 4Mb.andP;  Filling in the gap requires a substantialinvestment.andM;But some users are firmly committed to DOS.andP;  &quot;I think that DOS still has alot of life left,&quot; said Richmond.andM;But how much life?andP;  Colligan said, &quot;Demand for our product is higher now thanit ever has been.andP;  I expect that DOS will continue to be an importantoperating system at least until the mid-1990s.&quot;andM;That will be almost 10 years more than his initial expectation, which wasformed when Microsoft announced OS/2.andM;Korzeniowski is a freelance writer based in Malden, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
