In Austrian board rooms, newspaper columns and political speeches, &quot;internationalization&quot; is the byword. Squeezed by a tiny domestic market, decreasing trade with the Eastern bloc and a solidifying Common Market, Austria has little choice.    &quot;The time is ripe,&quot; says Josef Taus, president of Constantia Industrieholding AG, Austria's biggest private industrial company. &quot;We must do it to survive.&quot;    It won't be easy. Austria's economic and political history has ill-equipped it to compete in the world. And the uproar centering on President Kurt Waldheim's alleged Nazi past has tarnished Austria's image. The controversy is likely to dominate this week's official visit to the U.S. of Chancellor Franz Vranitzky.    Nonetheless, more Austrian names and products are popping up in foreign lands. Swarovski, a crystal company, recently teamed up with a partner to acquire Zale Corp., the No. 1 U.S. jewelry chain. Casinos Austria in six years has gained control of one-third of the gambling operations on the world's cruise ships. Metallwerk Plansee G.m.b.H. has grown into Europe's biggest metallurgy concern.    Exports more than doubled in five years, to the equivalent of $27.4 billion in 1986. The number of Austrian concerns with overseas subsidiaries also doubled over a three-year period, to 650 in 1983, the latest year for which statistics are available. And last year, Austrian investment abroad -- $360 million -- exceeded foreign spending in Austria for the first time.    But for all the gains, Austria has a long way to go. In foreign business, the landlocked country still lags by almost every measure. Per-capita exports are 55% below the average for nine comparable small nations in Western Europe. While 550,000 people work in foreign subsidiaries of Swiss companies, only 15,000 work in foreign units of Austrian companies. Austria had a $5.28 billion trade deficit last year.    Until 1918, the country had no need to look abroad: It did a brisk business with its own territories in the Austro-Hungarian empire, which stretched into present-day Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Italy and Yugoslavia.    &quot;Austrian trade developed in the heart of Europe's large Middle Kingdom,&quot; says Economic Minister Robert Graf. &quot;We have no overseas export tradition.&quot;    After World War I, the empire collapsed and the Treaty of Versailles set up the vastly reduced first Austrian republic. But that, too, was undermined in the 1930s by economic and political strife that paved the way for the Nazi takeover.    In the aftermath of World War II, while the rest of Europe was struggling back to its feet, Austria was occupied until 1955 by the Soviet Union, the U.S., France and Britain. Says Hannes Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein AG: &quot;Russian troops were no export promotion. . . . It's no surprise we're behind.&quot;    Although Austria staged its own postwar &quot;economic miracle,&quot; it focused on such basic industries as steel and paper. A hefty share of Austrian industry -- and exports -- is still concentrated in these undiversified, stagnant sectors.    Moreover, much Austrian industry was nationalized after the war to keep it out of Communist hands. And management and unions made the famous &quot;social relationship&quot; pledge to refrain from rocking the boat. Heavy subsidies kept unemployment down and taxes high. &quot;The large state-owned firms were meant to be the flagships,&quot; says Friedrich Gleissner, a trade official at the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber. &quot;It didn't work out that way.&quot;    Instead, not a single privately owned large multinational has emerged. Amid the revolution in computers, electronics and biotechnology, alpine Austria excels mainly at attracting tourists.    &quot;There's no doubt that we need a larger proportion of economic activity abroad,&quot; says Chancellor Vranitzky, a Socialist. &quot;We have to use the dynamics of Western economies for our own development.&quot;    West Germany's economic slowdown is another setback for neighboring Austria, which sends a third of its exports there. As Germany's growth rate falters, so does Austria's, to a projected 1% or less this year from 1.8% last year.    The Common Market's campaign to demolish all remaining trade barriers within the 12-nation economic bloc also worries Austrians. They fear that a more unified Common Market, which today absorbs 67% of their exports, might buy fewer goods from the outside.    The saturated domestic market provides no relief. In a country of 7.5 million people, &quot;companies are finally discovering it's ridiculous to produce only for the Austrian market,&quot; says Walter Wolfsberger, head of Siemens Austria AG.    Those in the vanguard of the push for markets abroad, analysts say, are small, innovative firms. Plasser andamp; Theurer AG, for example, has an 80% world market share in railroad construction and maintenance machines. Franz Haas Waffelmaschinen Industrie G.m.b.H. controls 60% of the world's waffle-machine market.    A 1985 oil-trading scandal at Voest-Alpine AG, Austria's steel giant and biggest state-owned industrial conglomerate, highlighted doubts in the long-ruling Socialist Party about whether ideology belongs in industry. The result has been a recognition that Austria must join the deregulation bandwagon. Under a $2.6 billion restructuring of the state-owned sector, Voest and other firms have been laying off workers, closing down plants, denationalizing subsidiaries and seeking foreign partners.    Austria has begun to &quot;move with the tide,&quot; says Herbert Krejci, head of the Association of Austrian Industrialists. &quot;We have to catch up. We can't only be Europe's playground.&quot;    As Austria courts foreign investment, officials say it has also shut the back door on illicit technology transfers to the East bloc that angered the Reagan administration. Mr. Vranitzky is likely to mention that in Washington.    At the same time, the country is hopeful that the economic initiatives under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost policy will make Austria a gateway for increased investment in the East.    &quot;More and more businessmen are looking at Austria as a market that puts together East and West,&quot; says U.S. Ambassador Ronald Lauder. To entice them, the government is cutting the top corporate tax rate to 55% from 62% and ending double taxation of profits. General Motors Corp. and Sony Corp. are two major players that have taken the bait, with plans to build factories expected to create 2,000 jobs.    But for all the talk of broader horizons, ingrained attitudes will be hard to change. Says Manfred Drennig, vice chairman of Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG, &quot;Many people would still like to build a wall around Austria. They forget what a short wall it would be.&quot;    ---                  Looking at Austria                                               Trade             GNP                             Deficit*          Growth        Inflation       (In billions) 1985        3%            3.2%            $5.42 1986        1.8           1.7              5.04 1987**      1             2.0              5.38 *Deficit calculated at current exchange rates **Projected figures Source: Austrian Institute of Economic Research</TEXT></DOC>
