Neither side would provide details about the agreement, which covers 3,800 hourly workers at the Rouge Steel complex here. The previous contract expired July 31, 1986, but was extended on a day-to-day basis during negotiations.    At a news conference, Stanley J. Surma, Ford's chief labor negotiator, said the agreement &quot;will go a long way toward improving our competitive position within the industry.&quot; He wouldn't elaborate.    Asked whether Ford nonetheless would continue to entertain any proposals to sell the steel operations, a company officer said, &quot;I suppose we'll talk&quot; to any potential buyer. The company has said it would consider selling the business.    Both Ford and UAW representatives were quick to note that the accord was reached without a strike and that this boded well for national auto contract talks scheduled to start at Ford July 28. Several of the bargainers involved in the Rouge negotiations also will be part of the broader national talks. Still, the union could strike Ford when the national contract runs out Sept. 14.    The Rouge Steel contract is scheduled for a ratification vote by the rank and file Thursday. </TEXT></DOC>
