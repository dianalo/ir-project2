The order is effective underthe Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C.601-674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein.Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has consideredthe economic impact of this final rule on small entities.The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 96 handlers of winter pears under this marketingorder, and approximately 1,800 winter pear producers in Washington, Oregon,and California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the SmallBusiness Administration (13 CFR 121.2) as those having annual gross revenuesfor the last three years of less than $500,000, and small agriculturalservice firms are defined as those whose gross annual receipts are lessthan $3,500,000. The majority of the handlers and producers of Winter Pearsmaybe classified as small entities.A final rule establishing expenses in the amount of $3,354,351 for thecommittee for the fiscal period ending June 30, 1989, was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4> on August 5, 1988 (53 FR 29441). Such expensesincluded $2,774,857 for ``paid advertising'' and a ``contingency'' fundof $209,499. The final rule also fixed an assessment rate to be leviedon winter pear handlers during the 1988-89 fiscal period.In a recently conducted mail ballot, the committee voted unanimously toincrease its budget of expenses from $3,354,351 to $3,802,846. Of the $448,495increase in expenditures, $337,803 is for additional ``paid advertising''deemed necessary to market the record large 1988-89 crop. These additionalfunds are to be allocated among the existing promotional projects whichappear to be achieving the best results. The remaining $110,692 is to beadded to the ``contingency'' expenditures. Contingency funds may be usedfor emergency spending in any budget category, including promotion andpaid advertising.A proposed rule inviting comments on this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on March 1, 1989 (54 FR 8544). The comment periodended March 13, 1989. No comments were received.Because of the unexpected record large crop, additional assessment fundsare available to cover the increase in expenses. Hence, no increase inthe assessment rate was recommended by the committee.Based on the foregoing, the Administrator of AMS has determined that thisaction will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.It is found that the increased expenses are reasonable and likely to beincurred, and that such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policyof the Act.Approval of the increased expenses must be expedited because the committeeneeds to have authority to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuousbasis and to conduct the additional promotion activities deemed necessaryto market the record large crop. Therefore, it is found that good causeexists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 daysafter publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> (5 U.S.C. 553).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 927</ITAG>Marketing agreement and order, Winter pears, Oregon, Washington, California.For reason set forth in the preamble, andSection; 927.228 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 927_WINTER PEARS GROWN IN OREGON, WASHINGTON AND CALIFORNIA</ITAG>1.
