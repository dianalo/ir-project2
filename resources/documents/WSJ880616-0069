Proxy solicitors representing Texaco as well as Carl C. Icahn, who is leading the charge against the oil giant's board, said the controversy involves more shareholders, more shares and more ballots than any proxy fight in history. &quot;By far it's the largest ever waged,&quot; said Richard Nye, an official of Georgeson andamp; Co., which represents Texaco.    And by all current guessing, it remains a cliffhanger. &quot;It looks like a very close election,&quot; Mr. Nye said. Added a Texaco strategist, &quot;It's no slam-dunk.&quot; Icahn strategists agreed.    The closeness of the race has enlarged the significance of a 7.7 million-share block that changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday, assuming that proxies were exchanged along with the shares. &quot;It's the swing vote,&quot; said another Texaco strategist.    Initially, traders were convinced that the seller of the big block was Kolhberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which owned roughly 4.9% of Texaco's common on April 11, the record date for voting at the annual meeting. But one widespread rumor suggested yesterday that KKR might have instead been the buyer of the block, which, according to the rumor, was assembled by Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. from several institutions wishing to cash out their positions in advance of the meeting. Bear Stearns, which handled both the buy and sell sides of the transaction, declined to comment.    However, several large market players discounted that speculation, stressing that KKR sold at least part of its stake because it was in a difficult situation. They speculate that the firm didn't want to vote for Texaco because the share price could fall if management won. Conversely, they speculated KKR didn't want to side with Mr. Icahn because it didn't want to be associated with a corporate raider. These same players speculate that Bear Stearns and a number of its arbitrager clients now own the stake.    Wall Street strategists say KKR risked little if it were the purchaser, rather than the seller, of the share block. If Mr. Icahn wins and his $60-a-share takeover offer is put to a shareholder vote, as Mr. Icahn wishes, then KKR would be in a strong position to follow Mr. Icahn's bid with a higher offer and attempt its own takeover of the company. And if Mr. Icahn loses, the investment firm could make its own friendly offer to lead Texaco through a leveraged buy-out or some other major restructuring, the strategists speculate.    Proxy solicitors have continued courting KKR for its proxy, however because there is speculation the firm, if it did indeed sell, may not have sold its votes with the shares.    Many institutions continue to play their proxies close to their vest, awaiting any unexpected, last-minute announcements about Mr. Icahn's $60-a-share takeover proposal for Texaco or about Texaco's own restructuring moves. Proxy-fight experts say this thus will become one of the rare major annual meetings at which major shareholders arrive with their proxies in their hands. A capacity crowd is expected at the 1,000-seat ballroom of the Westin Hotel in Tulsa, Okla.    In fact, according to Georgeson, toll-free hotlines will be established to Tulsa so shareholders not traveling to the meeting may vote until the &quot;polls&quot; officially are closed. That won't occur until the annual meeting already is well under way, with both sides having the opportunity to make their final pitch.    An official of D.F. King andamp; Co., which is soliciting proxies for Mr. Icahn, said Texaco's 242 million shares outstanding may generate as many as 300,000 individual ballots, including multiple voting by the same shares. Besides having the opportunity to change their votes as often as they wish, a number of shareholders invariably vote twice -- and not always the same way -- as a result of confusion between investors and their stockbrokers, the official said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texaco shares closed at $49.875, down 50 cents, on volume of 2.6 million shares.    Whatever the leanings of officials at KKR, Texaco yesterday went out of its way to distance KKR from the controversy that Texaco has generated about the stock block. Texaco has been trying to prove that Mr. Icahn worked secretly, in violation of securities laws, to find a buyer for the block that was friendly to him. Texaco emphasized that it &quot;does not contend that Kohlberg Kravis andamp; Roberts participated in the wrongdoing&quot; alleged by Texaco.    KKR has declined all comment on the block.    ---                      The Texaco Vote   Estimated control of shares outstanding, in millions of shares    Institutions                        93.3    Individuals                         48.6    Icahn                               36.1    Brokers                             32.4    KKR                                 12.0    Management*                         10.5    Arbitragers                         10.0   *Includes employee stock plan</TEXT></DOC>
