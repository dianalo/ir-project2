The 66-page decision, which the judge said allows the Bells to enter &quot;new and uncharted waters,&quot; is certain to have a widespread impact on the telecommunications industry. Under it, the companies can offer such services as data transmission, electronic mail, voice message services and audiotex.    The ruling significantly expands the Bell concerns' ability to enter these markets, though it still bars the seven companies from originating the data they transmit. The decision, which the telecommunications industry had awaited for months, clarifies Judge Greene's ruling last September that opened the door for transmission of information services.    Both in its tone and in some of its conclusions, the ruling seems more sympathetic to the Bells than earlier opinions issued by Judge Greene were. As chief overseer of the 1984 decree that broke up American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., Judge Greene has continued to bar the resulting Bell companies from manufacturing equipment and from providing long-distance services.    The Bells praised yesterday's decision as a step in the right direction.    &quot;The benefits of divestiture will, for the first time, be realized because of this order,&quot; a spokeswoman for U S West Inc., Englewood, Colo., said. &quot;It is a tremendous victory for all telephone users because for the first time it will allow easy, economical access to all kinds of information.&quot;    But there was some criticism of Judge Greene for continuing to ban the Bells from generating the content of the services they can provide.    &quot;We still are not allowed to provide content for information services -- and there is no apparent basis for retaining that restriction,&quot; a spokesman for BellSouth Corp., Atlanta, said. &quot;While this order represents an important step, for this reason it certainly doesn't go far enough.&quot;    A spokesman for ATandamp;T said the decision &quot;shows flexibility on the part of Judge Greene in making changes in the consent decree.&quot; ATandamp;T supported the regional Bell companies' request for permission to offer information services last summer, before Judge Greene's September ruling.    Though Judge Greene continued to bar the Bells from originating or changing the content of most computerized information services, his decision for the first time spelled out a broad range of acceptable services.    Granting &quot;wide flexibility to the regional companies with respect to transmission systems and voice storage applications,&quot; the opinion said, will &quot;bring this nation closer to the enjoyment of the full benefits of the information age.&quot; In another section of the ruling, Judge Greene said &quot;broad public policies&quot; intended to promote &quot;efficient, rapid and inexpensive dissemination&quot; of information outweigh potential antitrust problems.    Judge Greene ruled that the Bells can offer audiotex services, which provide information though touch-tone phones, on the same basis as videotex services, which deliver news, stock prices, shopping information and the like via personal computers.    He also wrote that permitted transmission services will include billing management and so-called protocol conversion services, which allow communication among different computer terminals and operating systems.    As he has in the past, Judge Greene used the French Minitel and Teletel systems as standards for comparison, but he said those state-sponsored systems &quot;should not be cast in concrete as the sole option available&quot; to the U.S.    By allowing the phone companies to provide voice messaging and electronic mail, the ruling opens the way to a new category of service -- and a new use for the telephone network -- that could become a major new revenue source.    &quot;It defined transmission in a way that the (Bells) have a bigger ballfield to play on,&quot; Kenneth Allen, senior vice president of the Information Industry Association, a Washington-based trade group, said.    Analysts said the companies' entry into new businesses could expand the markets, but it could be a two-edged sword for vendors of electronic mail and voice messaging systems. For example, an answering service provided by the Bells could make answering machines unnecessary.    It could also be a boon for the electronic-mail market because the Bells, limited to providing local service, could connect with such national electronic mail providers as British Telecommunications PLC, MCI Communications Corp., Western Union Corp. and GTE Corp. Moreover, their entry would further legitimize electronic mail and voice messaging, analysts said. With their powerful local market presence, the Bells could increase business for the national providers, analysts said.    &quot;A lot of the world changes with (Judge Greene's) order,&quot; David Simon of Digital Video Corp., an information services marketing consultant, said.    The ruling also is likely to reduce friction between Judge Greene and the Reagan administration over telecommunications policy. The head of the Commerce Department's telecommunications agency, for example, praised the decision, saying, &quot;The average residential and small-business telephone user now has the prospect of new and more advanced service choices.&quot;    But it will be some time before consumers benefit from the ruling.    &quot;You have to hold your applause if you're a consumer,&quot; Harry Shooshan, a Washington communications consultant, said. Before the new services can become widespread, the Federal Communications Commission must approve many of them, and the Bell companies must develop and test them.    A spokeswoman for the FCC said the agency was reviewing the judge's order and had no immediate comment. The FCC isn't likely to present an obstacle to the companies, however. It jumped the gun on Judge Greene this year and approved plans by two Bell companies -- San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group and Bell Atlantic Corp., Philadelphia -- to offer voice-message services.    ---   Johnnie L.
