In their political report, the ministers said there was``increased cooperation between Israel and South Africa,'' andexpressed ``indignation and dismay that certain Western nations ... continued to aid and abet apartheid economically, financially,politically, diplomatically and militarily.''   They noted ``with regret'' that, despite efforts to pressleading industrialized countries to impose mandatory economicsanctions against white-ruled South Africa, the U.N. SecurityCouncil had again been prevented from adopting sanctions byAmerican and British vetoes.   The document expressed disappointment that Japan increased itstrade with South Africa, whose apartheid policies establish aracially segregated society in which the 5 million whites controlthe country and the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs.   It called on member states ``to begin in earnest the stockpilingof relief materials for appropriate use in support of thefront-line and other states in southern Africa, to assist them towithstand reprisals by South Africa.''   South Africa has been accused of launching raids in neighboringblack countries to strike at the African National Congress, themain guerrilla group fighting the white-led government.   The final document ``strongly condemned the hypocrisy of theU.S. administration and the Pretoria racist regime for talkingpeace'' in Namibia while continuing to provide military support tothe UNITA rebels fighting the Marxist government in Angola.   With regard to the Palestinian attempts to establish a homelandin the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the report said, ``The ministerssaluted the heroic uprising of the Palestinian people in the(Israeli) occupied territories.''   It said the uprising was ``tangible evidence of theirdetermination to have a state of their own, which proves thefutility of the Israeli efforts to continue the occupation ofPalestine.''   The final report also said a Middle East settlement should bebased ``on the right of the Palestinian people toself-determination and their right to establish an independent andsovereign Palestinian state in their national homeland, Palestine.''   The report called on both Iraq and Iran to cooperate in goodfaith with the U.N. secretary-general for full implementation ofthe UN-sponsored cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war, which wentinto effect on Aug. 20.   The non-aligned movement was formed in 1961 by nations claimingnot to be aligned with the East or West.   Before adjourning, the foreign ministers decided early Sundaythat Yugoslavia will host next year's summit meeting and have thechairmanship for the next three years.</TEXT></DOC>
