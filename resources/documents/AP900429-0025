President F.W. de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela areexpected to make progress and clear the way for constitutionaltalks later this year.   Mandela and the African National Congress demand an end to thestate of emergency imposed June 12, 1986, release of politicalprisoners and other concessions before full negotiations can begin.   The two sides face enormous challenges in seeking a peaceful,workable solution to South Africa's racial divisions. Violence isincreasing and elements in both racial groups oppose any settlement.   Despite their hopes of a solution, de Klerk and Mandela remainfar apart on plans for the new South Africa both say they want tobuild. Neither has been able to suggest the differences can beresolved.   De Klerk's government expresses support for a democratic systemand ending apartheid, but opposes simple majority rule, contendingthat would lead to black domination. De Klerk wants veto power forwhites and safeguards that would preserve much of their wealth andprivilege.   ``We believe that majority rule is not suitable for a countrylike South Africa because it will lead to the domination and eventhe suppression of minorities,'' de Klerk told Parliament on April17.   ``While we are honest and genuine in our quest to create equalopportunities for all, we are not prepared to destroy existingrights or allow them to be destroyed.''   The ANC remains committed to a one-person, one-vote system withno special privileges for whites, and refuses to renounce itsguerrilla campaign.   ANC leaders also must find ways to satsify the needs andaspirations of millions of impoverished blacks in South Africa,where blacks outnumber whites more than 5 to 1.   ``Only successful negotiations can convince us to end the armedstruggle, and peace will come as a result of negotiations,''Mandela told a rally April 22. ``The armed struggle must beintensified, but in a disciplined way, to ensure that thegovernment does not backtrack from the path of negotiation.''   Other problems include ANC demands that the economy benationalized to help poor blacks catch up with whites. Thegovernment and white businessmen oppose any plans fornationalization or compulsory redistribution of wealth.   White extremists are arming for what they predict will be a racewar and government officials worry about a violent backlash. Thepro-apartheid Conservative Party, the main white opposition, claimsit would win an election because most whites oppose de Klerk'splans.   ``People are arming themselves, said Andries Treurnicht, theConservative leader. ``They have the right to protect themselves.''   Gerrit Viljoen, constitutional development minister,acknowledged the government wanted quick agreement with the ANC toavoid a white backlash.   ``Our approach is, let us do these things as soon as possible sothat people can see the heavens have not fallen in,'' he said.   The ANC worries about losing support among black militants whooppose any settlement with the government. Young blacks who controlmany of the black townships honor Mandela as a leader, but somereject his moderate line.   More radical black groups have criticized Mandela and the ANCfor even negotiating. The Pan African Congress and other militantssay the only thing to be negotiated is the whites' surrender ofpower.   A wave of violence has accompanied the political maneuvering,most of it fighting between rival black groups. Police report 574deaths in the first three months of 1990.   The independent South African Institute for Race Relations said4,000 people would be killed this year if violence continued at thecurrent rate. ``Black-on-black violence in South Africa is nowrunning at its highest level in modern times,'' the institute said.   Mandela's image has been tarnished by his inability to halt theviolence. Some political observers see the factional warfare as thestart of a struggle for power between black groups divided alongtribal, regional and ideological lines.</TEXT></DOC>
