Searle andamp; Co. by awoman who claimed the company's CU-7 intrauterine contraceptivedevice left her infertile.   Terms of the settlement, reached Tuesday during thetwo-month-long U.S. District Court trial, were not disclosed. JudgeMariana Pfaelzer sealed the agreement with a confidentiality order,Searle spokeswoman Kay Bruno said Wednesday in Chicago.   Laura F. McCarthy, a former Los Angeles resident who lives inButte, Mont., was among about 800 women who have sued thepharmaceutical firm over its CU-7 copper IUD. She claimed it madeher infertile.   About 330 of the cases have been disposed in favor of Searle,and some 420 cases are still active, Bruno said. The settlement inMcCarthy's case was reached before closing arguments were made tothe jury.   Roger Brosnahan, McCarthy's attorney, said the confidentialityorder was made at Searle's request.   ``As far as the case is concerned, we destroyed their foundationof defense for this product. ... I think it's a clear turning pointin the litigation,'' said Brosnahan, whose firm is handling 150 to200 lawsuits against Searle over the CU-7 device.   He declined to directly characterize McCarthy's reaction to thesettlement.   McCarthy's lawsuit first came to trial under senior U.S.District Judge Irving Hill in January. But Hill declared amistrial, saying rough tactics and delaying measures by attorneyson both sides were threatening his health.   Although most of the cases thus far have favored Searle, thecompany was ordered last year to pay a Minnesota woman $8.75million in damages.   Brosnahan said the next CU-7 case for his firm was scheduled forMay 15 in St. Paul, Minn.   ``We're going to keep pounding on their doors and bringing thembefore juries until everybody recognizes how bad this product is,and how bad Searle's conduct was,'' he said.   Searle said it stopped selling the CU-7 in the United States inJanuary 1986 because it could not get insurance due to the manylawsuits. Approval of the device from the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration remains in effect.</TEXT></DOC>
