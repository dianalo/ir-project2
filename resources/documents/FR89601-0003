Pursuant to 5U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Servicehas certified that this proposed action would not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. This action lessens theregulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensurethat dairy farmers will continue to have their milk priced under the orderand thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule underthe criteria contained therein.This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the AgriculturalMarketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), and ofthe order regulating the handling of milk in the Southwestern Idaho-EasternOregon marketing area.Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 28, 1989 (54 FR 18298) concerning aproposed suspension of certain provisions of the order. Interested personswere afforded opportunity to file written data, views and arguments thereon.No comments opposing the suspension were received.After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal inthe notice, the comments received, and other available information, itis hereby found and determined that for the months of June through November1989 the following provisions of the order do not tend to effectuate thedeclared policy of the Act:In andSection; 1135.13, paragraphs (f) (3), (4), (5), and (6).<ITAG tagnum="84">Statement of Consideration</ITAG>This action continues to remove for the months of June through November1989 the limit on the amount of producer milk that a cooperative associationor other handler may divert from pool plants to nonpool plants. The provisions,which have been suspended since December 1988, provide that a cooperativeassociation may divert up to 80 percent of its total member milk receivedat all pool plants or diverted therefrom during any month. Similarly, theoperator of a pool plant may divert up to 80 percent of its receipts ofproducer milk (for which the operator of such plant is the handler duringthe month) during any month.Dairymen's Creamery Association, Inc. (DCA), an association of producersthat supplies much of the market's fluid milk needs and handles much ofthe market's reserve milk supplies, requested the suspension. DCA indicatedthat operation of the 80-percent diversion limit would mean that over 2,000,000pounds of milk must be unloaded and re-loaded each month at the Meridian,Idaho, pool supply plant to be transferred to nonpool manufacturing plants.According to the cooperative such unnecessary handling would be undertakenfor the sole purpose of meeting the delivery requirements of the order.The cooperative stated that such unnecessary unloading and re-loading takesemployees' time, increases the exposure of milk to contamination, and requiresadditional cleaning of lines and tanks.Western Dairymen Cooperative, Inc. (WDCI) filed comments supporting therequested suspension. WDCI stated that the suspension would greatly reducehauling costs, as well as reducing the cost of operating the supply plant.For the year preceding April 1989, producer milk pooled under the SouthwesternIdaho-Eastern Oregon milk order increased 22 percent over production levelsof the previous year. Although receipts of producer milk used in ClassI have also increased, they have done so at a much slower rate. Consequently,the percentage of milk produced in the market that is surplus to the market'sfluid milk needs has increased significantly in the past year.Given the marked increase in the volume of producer milk pooled under theorder, the requested suspension will allow the pooling of producers whostand ready to supply the fluid milk requirements of the marketing areato be handled without undue expense. There is no indication that the suspensionwould encourage association with the order of the milk of producers whoare not bona fide suppliers of the bottling needs of the market.It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effectivedate hereof is impractical, unnecessary and contrary to the public interestin that:(a) The suspension is necessary to reflect current marketing conditionsand to assure orderly marketing in the marketing area in that without extensive,unnecessary and expensive hauling and handling, substantial quantitiesof milk from producers who regularly supply the market would be excludedfrom the marketwide pool, thereby causing a disruption in the orderly marketingof milk;(b) This suspension does not require of persons affected substantial orextensive preparation prior to the effective date; and(c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and theywere afforded opportunity to file written data, views or arguments concerningthis suspension.Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publicationin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1135</ITAG>Milk marketing orders, Milk, Dairy products.It is therefore ordered, That the following provisions in andSection; 1135.13of the Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon order are hereby suspended forthe months of June through November 1989:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1135_MILK IN THE SOUTHWESTERN IDAHO-EASTERN OREGON MARKETINGAREA</ITAG>1.
