 We have no particular reason to doubt that, but asthis is being written deliveries of actual production units have barelystarted.andM;For this analysis we attended a two-hour demonstration and talked to userswho received boards from the first production run of 50 units.andP;  However, ourown unit will not arrive until the next larger batch of boards is finished inabout two weeks.andM;Toaster functionsandM;From the user's point of view, the Toaster looks like a set of somehalf-dozen related video capabilities:andM;* four-channel switcher with preview andandM;program outputsandM;* digital video effects (DVE) unitandM;* paint systemandM;* titling systemandM;* still-storeandM;* solids modelerandM;* animation programandM;* rendering package.andM;Each function is controlled by one or more software programs, all fairly wellintegrated using a video control-board metaphor.andP;  The software runs only onthe Toaster hardware, which uses a combination of custom-designed andstandard chips to turn the software instructions into video.andP;  The Toaster, inturn, uses some of the chips in the Amiga, and only runs in that machine.andM;NewTek claims the Toaster output is &quot;broadcast quality,&quot; but there seems tobe some debate about how literally that statement should be interpreted.andO;Because the output video is synthesized from a digital representation ratherthan encoded from RGB components, the general quality of the RS-170A signalis much better than produced by most professional video gear.andP;  But videoengineers who have received the board say they'll need another few weeksbefore they are sure that the unit meets all relevant timing, phasing andvoltage specifications.andM;Even as stand-alone products, most of the functions would rate high marks asvideo production tools.andP;  For example, the titling functions compare favorablyto the Chyron machines found at most television stations.andP;  To get solidsmodeling, animation and rendering you'd normally have to go to a high-endvideo post-production house (for more details on Toaster functions, see ourreport in the next issue of our companion report, Mind Over Media).andM;But what's really most important is that all of these functions work wellenough to do the job for at least amateur through industrial video, cablesystems and some broadcast stations.andP;  Yet the cost of a complete system,including the necessary Amiga with a hard disk and 5 megabytes of memory, isliterally orders of magnitude less than the more traditional equivalent.andM;As a result, it should become possible to escape the limiting productioneconomics of the current system -- which, because of the huge amounts ofcapital required, are based largely on charging by the hour for each piece ofequipment or function that's used.andP;  With a Toaster-Amiga combination, theincremental cost of using the hardware is so small that the only significantcost for most projects will be labor.andM;Changed economicsandM;The effect should be very much like what happened when laser printersarrived.andP;  Up until then, if you wanted to typeset a newsletter or officedocument you first typed everything out in rough, laboriously calculated thelength of each story -- and then sent it out twice: once for typesetting,once for corrections.andP;  Now, you're likely to plan more roughly and run offevolving proofs and make changes as you go.andM;Similarly, with most current video productions, you plan each video element,work mostly off-line (without effects), and then add effects only at the laststep in an expensive by-the-hour on-line post-production suite.andM;With the Toaster, you'll be able to experiment, add effects as you go, andshape your production through a process of refinement.andP;  Even if you only usethe Toaster for making a rough cut, you'll be able to do more of the job morerealistically on the desktop.andP;  The line between off-line editing and on-lineproduction will no longer be a sharp one.andM;The heightened capability on the desktop and the softening of the linesshould also throw video production open to a much wider group of creativepeople.andP;  Just as laser printers brought forth a much larger group ofprint-based designers, this scale of desktop video will be affordable forindividuals, schools and small offices.andM;As the economic barriers fall away, we'll get a lot of really terrible videodone by people with more enthusiasm than talent.andP;  But we should also see alot of original and creative work done by people who previously would neverhad access to the needed tools.andM;LimitationsandM;Unfortunately, the Toaster is not a complete video production system byitself.andP;  You still need separate audio for live productions and a separatesystem of control for tape decks and/or single-frame recording for preparedpresentations and animation.andM;Furthermore, the initial release of the Toaster software doesn't support timecode or sequenced effects.andP;  That means every cut and effect has to be donemanually.andP;  At best, you can set one effect to occur when you activate ahardware trigger line called a General Purpose Interface (GPI).andP;  You cannotset up the system to repeat a string of effects each time.andP;  The first releasealso lacks support for the Amiga AREXX scripting and control language.andM;For many users, the Amiga itself will be the weak point.andP;  While you don'thave to know much about the Amiga to run the more directly interactiveaspects of the Toaster package, setup, storing and retrieving files andimporting and exporting graphics all require at least a basic knowledge ofAmiga DOS.andP;  And even Amiga partisans admit that support from Commodore hasbeen uneven.andM;Commodore continues to suffer from weak distribution, which will also hurtthe Toaster's ultimate chances.andM;On the other hand, because most functions on the Toaster are primarily donewith software, you could say the Toaster is no more complete than a newcomputer with an initial set of programs.andP;  NewTek is still hard at workadding functions to the Toaster software, and officials have told some buyersprivately that they think they've only delivered about 20 percent of thehardware's ultimate capability.andM;The only thing close to the Toaster on other platforms is a three-board setfor the Macintosh introduced by Radius in September.andP;  However, the Radiusboards with software will probably retail for about $10,000.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
