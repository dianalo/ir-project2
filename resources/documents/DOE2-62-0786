<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-62-0786 </DOCNO><TEXT>Foster Wheeler has now completed construction of a 90 MW gas turbine cogenerationplant in Martinez, CA. This plant consists of two Frame 6 gas turbines,each with waste heat boilers plus extraction condensing steam turbine.The plant, costing $89 MM, including soft costs, will provide 160,000lbs/hr of 600 lb, 750F steam plus 55 MW to the TOSCO Oil Company. Thebalance of the power, 35 MW, will be sold to the local utility, PacificGas and Electric. The FW Martinez project has some unique aspects. Toinsure retaining a Qualification Facility (QF) status under PURPA inthe unlikely case that the refinery no longer needed steam, a fall backposition had to be incorporated into the project design. This situationwas resolved when a chronic environmental sludge disposal problem atthe county water treatment plan was eliminated by employing some cogenerationplant steam in a multiple effect drying process.</TEXT></DOC>
