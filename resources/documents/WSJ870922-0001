But it is unclear whether the ban will ever take effect, because Texas Instruments immediately granted Samsung temporary licenses for the chips while the dispute between the two companies is still under negotiation.    A spokesman for the commission couldn't be reached after Texas Instruments announced the decision last night. Samsung officials also couldn't be reached for comment.    Analysts said the move by the commission was probably the first time that importation of a foreign company's semiconductors had been ordered halted. Semiconductor manufacturers have long complained that their creations were being unfairly copied by overseas competitors and then sold at below-cost prices.    In recent months, however, the domestic semiconductor industry has begun to emerge from a devastating slump caused by fierce foreign competition.    &quot;This is a significant development,&quot; Michael Gumport, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York, said of the commission decision. &quot;In the past two months, the Japanese have increased chip production about 20%. I imagine a tough decision like this from the ITC will remind them of the sensitivity of this issue in the U.S.&quot;    The importation ban covers Samsung's line of dynamic random access memory chips, known as DRAMs, as well as computers, facsimile machines and certain telecommunications equipment and printers if they contain chips that infringe Texas Instruments patents. DRAMs, which store information electronically, are one of the most basic components of personal computers and other electronic gear. Bringing DRAM prices up was one of the most important aims of the chip trade accord reached last year by Japan and the U.S.    Analysts figure that Samsung holds about 5% of the U.S. market for DRAMs, and Texas Instruments holds about 20%. A ban could drive prices up somewhat, which would help Texas Instruments and Micron Technology Inc., the only U.S. companies that continue to make DRAMs after the past few years' bloodletting in that market.    But the ban may never take place if Texas Instruments follows the pattern it has set with seven other Asian semiconductor firms it challenged in court and before the commission. In various settlements reached earlier this year, Texas Instruments exchanged semiconductor patent licenses with seven Japanese concerns, and extracted royalties as well. Texas Instruments said yesterday that the royalty agreements had brought in $138 million in the first half of 1987 but &quot;were expected to be much less significant in any future quarter.&quot;    The latest commission order will probably help Texas Instruments extract a similar agreement from Samsung, Mr. Gumport, the analyst, said.    Texas Instruments continues to pursue the suit it brought against Samsung in U.S. District Court in Dallas in 1986, alleging that the South Korean company was making chips based on Texas Instruments' patents.    In another action yesterday, the commission upheld an earlier finding by an administrative law judge that NEC Corp., another Japanese company that Texas Instruments had challenged in court and before the commission, hadn't infringed Texas Instruments patents. Texas Instruments said it settled the lawsuit with NEC, and agreed to trade chip patent licenses. Texas Instruments said the agreement with NEC didn't include the large royalties of some of the other agreements.    The commission ban on Samsung DRAMs becomes effective after a 60-day presidential review period. </TEXT></DOC>
