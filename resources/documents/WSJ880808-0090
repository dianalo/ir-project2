Haft advised the company that a partnership he controls plans to buy a stake in Zayre.    Zayre's disclosure, which was accompanied by an announcement that it expects to report a &quot;substantial&quot; loss for its fiscal second quarter, ended July 30, didn't affect the company's stock. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, the retailer's shares closed at $22, up $1, ex-dividend.    Mr. Haft is chairman and chief executive officer of Landover, Md.-based Dart Group Corp. A spokesman for Mr. Haft declined to say whether the partnership he controls already owns a stake in Zayre or whether it has intentions of acquiring Zayre.    Zayre said Mr. Haft told it in a letter that his Federal Partnership plans to buy enough Zayre shares to give Federal's stake in the company a value of at least $15 million. Mr. Haft added that the partnership would file a notification of its Zayre purchases with federal authorities under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, Zayre said. The act requires that investments exceeding $15 million be reported to the Federal Trade Commission.    Dart's takeover bid for Stop andamp; Shop Cos. began in much the same way earlier this year. First, Dart quietly sent a letter to Stop andamp; Shop, indicating it intended to acquire a major stake in the supermarket and department-store concern and then hoped to acquire the entire company. When a friendly bid was rejected, Dart mounted a hostile takeover campaign. Stop andamp; Shop was eventually taken private in a leveraged buyout through Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.    Over the past three years, Dart, which operates Trak Auto Corp. and Crown Books Corp., has been trying to join retailing's major league by making acquisitions. Since 1985, it has unsuccessfully tried to acquire at least five companies, including Safeway Stores Inc., Supermarkets General Corp. and Dayton Hudson Corp.    Zayre said it hasn't had any discussions with Mr. Haft or his representatives. A Zayre spokesman said a $15 million investment in Zayre's stock would be equivalent to a stake of about 1.5%. Zayre has about 56 million common shares outstanding.    During the past few months, there has been speculation that Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the Bass family of Texas and other investors might be interested in acquiring Zayre. Last year, investor Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., who is believed to own a sizable stake in Zayre, notified the company that he may seek to buy a majority of its stock. In April, Zayre adopted a new shareholder-rights plan aimed at giving it additional protection against hostile takeovers.    Zayre's discount department stores have been hurt by merchandising mistakes and stiff competition, depressing the company's stock and increasing the chances that it will become a takeover target. Moreover, the strong earnings of Zayre's 80%-owned TJX Cos. specialty stores could help attract bidders, according to industry analysts.    Zayre said the loss it expects to post for the fiscal second quarter reflects its discount department stores' &quot;disappointing sales and lower-than-expected profit margins.&quot;    In the year-earlier fiscal second quarter, Zayre had profit of $78.2 million, or $1.30 a share, after a one-time gain of $90 million from the sale of a minority interest in TJX Cos. Zayre's year-earlier sales were $1.4 billion.    Analysts said the stores' poor performance stems partly from Zayre's decision to cut back on promotional sales at the stores. &quot;The company is trying to retrain its customers to not wait for absurdly low sale prices before they come into&quot; Zayre's stores, said Margo McGlade, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. &quot;Zayre's losses can be seen as a short-term price it is paying as it tries to rebuild its customer base.&quot;    Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it placed about $236 million of securities of Zayre and TJX on its CreditWatch list with negative implications. Sandamp;P, citing the planned investment in Zayre by Mr. Haft's partnership, said Zayre might increase its debt during a takeover or while defending against one. </TEXT></DOC>
