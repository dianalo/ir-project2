There were 157 on-air evaluations of Bush as a candidate onevening newscasts from Jan. 1 to Feb. 16, said Robert Lichter, whohas been logging and analyzing television coverage of all thecontenders since early last year.   From Jan. 1 to Feb. 8, before Bush's third-place Iowa finish, 61percent of the evaluations were negative. From Feb. 9 through Feb.16, between the Iowa and New Hamphire contests, only 34 percent ofthe evaluations were negative.   Lichter called the trend ``a dramatic upturn'' that illustratesthe media tendency to treat front-runners more critically than therest of the pack.   ``As Bush's prospects dim ... suddenly for the first time inthis campaign he starts to get good press,'' Lichter said.   Part of the shift involved the virtual disappearance of storiesabout Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair, Lichter said. Beforethe Iowa caucuses Feb. 8, there were twice as many stories aboutIran-Contra as there were about any other policy issue. ThenIran-Contra ``dropped from sight,'' he said.   Lichter showed snippets of pre-Iowa campaign coverage thatincluded several pointed comments from Bush's chief rival, SenateMinority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.   In one nightly news clip, Dole said Bush never said anything atleadership meetings. ``I don't know, maybe he was just holdingback,'' he said. In another, Dole said he had ``a record ofleadership. ... I can't help it if he (Bush) can't provide any.''   After the Iowa caucuses, sample clips showed Barbara Bushcalling her husband ``wiser and smarter'' than the othercandidates. NBC Correspondent Tom Pettit said Bush was ``not aquitter. He's a very determined man.'' And a New Hampshire truckdriver told an interviewer that Bush ``seems a lot taller andsterner than I thought he would be.''   Lichter said most positive comments come from candidates andtheir families while negative ones come from others in the race.The trend worked to the disadvantage of Democrats because they keptpicking on each other _ particularly during debates, he said.   Sample clips of the Democrats included some acerbic comments onthe so-called Massachusetts miracle touted by Gov. Michael Dukakisas evidence of his successful economic policies.   ``I went to divinity school and they have a tougher definitionof the word miracle,'' Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., said during onedebate.   Rep. Dick Gephardt and Sen. Paul Simon provided many instancesof Democratic sniping picked up by network news. Among the clips:   ``It is legitimate for me to say where are you going? Who is thereal Dick Gephardt?'' said Simon, defending an anti-Gephardttelevision ad.   ``I asked Sen. Simon to take those ads off television,''Gephardt said. ``And if he doesn't, he should take off his bow tiebecause he's just another politician.''   Lichter said ABC and NBC coverage of Bush stayed just about thesame after Bush's confrontation with Dan Rather on CBS. But Bush'spositive evaluations on CBS dropped sharply from about 50 percentto 27 percent after the set-to, Lichter said.   Lichter said the negative CBS coverage may have been ``oneblip'' attributable to ``a lot of anger'' over the incident. Hesaid Bush stories on CBS since Iowa are in the same ballpark asother networks _ about 60 percent positive.   ``Horse-race'' comments about a candidate's chances were notincluded in the tallies of positive and negative evaluations.Comments that were counted came from candidates, their families andaides, network correspondents, independent experts and others.   Lichter is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute andco-director of the Center for Media and Policy Studies. Besidestracking network news coverage of the candidates, he is alsomonitoring election-year political humor on the Johnny Carson andDavid Letterman shows.</TEXT></DOC>
