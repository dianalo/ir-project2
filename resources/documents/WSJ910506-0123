The compound, developed by Great Lakes Chemical Corp. ofWest Lafayette, Ind., is among several proposed by chemicalcompanies as substitutes for a group of chemicals known asHalons, which are used in fire extinguishers.</LP><TEXT>   The companies have faced a major challenge in replacingHalons, whose bromine content makes them very good firesuppressors but also very destructive to the ozone layer. Inthe latest issue of Science magazine, researchers at NOAAlaboratories in Boulder, Colo., reported that the Great Lakeschemical, FM-100, lingers in the atmosphere for seven toeight years instead of the 80 years for Halons.   &quot;Based on our studies, we think the substitute is prettygood. Its fire-suppression ability is same as Halons', andits life is shorter,&quot; said A.R. Ravishankara, a researchchemist at the federal labs.   The study is important because different companies arepursuing paths to Halon substitutes. Great Lakes is trying tocreate compounds that contain bromine and yet are lessharmful to ozone. Du Pont Co. has decided to exclude bromine.   The amount of Halons produced annually is small comparedwith chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are suspected ofinflicting serious damage on the ozone layer and which aresupposed to be phased out of production by the year 2000 byinternational treaty. The pact calls for continuing Halonproduction past that deadline for &quot;essential&quot; applications,which haven't yet been identified.   But Halons, which are brominated compounds, are morethreatening because their bromine depletes ozone more rapidlythan does CFCs' chlorine. Moreover, some Halons also containchlorine. According to scientists, chlorine and bromine reactwith ozone &quot;in synergy,&quot; even in the absence of oxygen andsunlight, which are required for CFCs alone to react withozone.   In the Great Lakes substitute, chlorine is replaced by anhydrogen atom, and as a result, &quot;the quantity of chemicaltransported to the stratosphere is reduced,&quot; Mr. Ravishankarasaid.   While Great Lakes' FM-100 product is good news forcustomers who want environmentally safer fire extinguishersin the near future, NOAA's Mr. Ravishankara expressed concernabout its long-term acceptance. &quot;The substitute is still asbad as the chlorofluorocarbons that we're trying to get ridof,&quot; he said.   Mark Sweval, business manager for performance chemicals atGreat Lakes, said the company's new product was &quot;the firststep&quot; toward developing less-harmful, brominatedfire-extinguishing chemicals.   He said that FM-100 has been approved by the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency for limited use, and that anapplication for wider use, such as in hand-held fireextinguishers, is currently pending. The new chemical is 1.1times more ozone-destructive than the common refrigerantCFC-11. The Halons that it would replace are 10 to 13 timesmore harmful than CFC-11.   &quot;Our goal is zero ozone depletion. But it's possible thatultimately we may conclude that unless you have some amountof bromine, you will not have a safe fire extinguisher. Thenpolicymakers will have to decide how to balance the potentialenvironmental impact against the safety benefit to society,&quot;Mr. Sweval said.   In explaining the different approach at Du Pont, DonaldDunn, market manager for aerosol and Halon products, took aless sanguine view of brominated chemicals. He said anyproduct with ozone-depletion potential &quot;wouldn't be allowedto exist after the year 2000, because we are going to seefurther restrictions. We just couldn't see making aninvestment in a compound that had bromine in it,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
