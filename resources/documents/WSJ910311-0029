That's because of the belief that both the economy's worstdays and the Federal Reserve's easing process are just aboutover, currency analysts say.</LP><TEXT>   Even when the dollar falters, &quot;just about everybody in theworld is looking to buy on dips&quot; because sentiment is sobullish, says Kevin Weir, a trader at the Canadian ImperialBank of Commerce in New York.   With help from corporate buying interest, the dollar seemsto have &quot;self-sustaining momentum,&quot; he says.   The dollar certainly fared well Friday despite a doubledose of bearish U.S. economic news.   Firm from the start of global trading in the Far East, thedollar rallied in early trading here despite reports that theU.S. unemployment rate increased to a fouryear high of 6.5%last month while nonfarm payrolls dropped an unexpectedlysharp 184,000.   The Federal Reserve signaled it was relaxing credit notlong after the data were released by arranging weekend systemrepurchase agreements when the important federal funds ratewas at its perceived target of 6 1/4%. Through systemrepurchase agreements, the Fed can aggressively add reservesto the banking system.   If the Fed is actually easing, the new target level forthe federal funds rate, or the rate banks charge one anotheron overnight loans, probably will be 6%, economists say.   While another rate cut probably won't spark a dollar freefall, it might sap the currency's strength by lessening theattractiveness of U.S. credit market yields.   Despite the worrisome employment data and the Fed'sreserve addition, the dollar traded late Friday in New Yorkat 1.5690 marks and 136.74 yen, higher than 1.5455 marks and135.60 yen late Thursday.   In Tokyo early Monday, the dollar was trading at 137.75yen, up from Friday's Tokyo close of 136.33 yen. Meanwhile,the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5760 marks, up fromFriday's Tokyo close of 1.5550 marks.   The pound finished at $1.8645, having plunged more thantwo cents on news that Britain's ruling Tories lost a specialdistrict election to the Liberal Democrats because of voters'anger at the new local government tax.   But there are few signs of weakness in the dollar.Propelled by postwar euphoria, the dollar is far above itsmonth-ago levels of 1.46 marks and 128 yen.   Not too long ago, the dollar dropped like a rock becauseof the concerns about the U.S. recession and the Fed's easiermonetary policy. But the quick victory by U.S.led alliedforces in the Persian Gulf war changed things. While theyonce expected a deep U.S. recession that would requirefurther aggressive Fed easing, many economists are nowlooking for an abbreviated slowdown that may not warrant manymore rate cuts.   &quot;There should be a bit of a bounceback&quot; in the secondquarter, says Oliver Adler, senior economist at Union Bank ofSwitzerland in New York.   The first-quarter gross national product probably willcontract at an annual rate of approximately 1%, but in thesecond quarter, the economy likely will liven up with helpfrom increased consumer spending after the war, he predicts.GNP decelerated at a 2% rate in the fourth quarter.   Because of the brighter outlook for the U.S., traders arefocusing more on Germany and Japan, where growth is expectedto cool later this year because of the restrictive monetarypolicies of the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan.   &quot;The relative bad-news index is speaking in favor of theU.S.,&quot; Mr. Adler contends.   While sentiment about the dollar remains strongly bullish,the U.S. currency may not have smooth sailing for muchlonger, some traders warn. On the fundamental side, there arefears that global central banks are getting geared up tointervene if the dollar rises to 1.60 marks, currencyanalysts say.   Friday, the Bank of Canada was seen by traders selling theU.S. currency against the Canadian dollar. And the SwissNational Bank confirmed that it moved to boost the franc byselling the dollar in swap agreements Thursday and Friday.   Technically, the overbought dollar meets increasingresistance with each pfennig and yen it gains. David Horner,senior financial strategist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., says thedollar is approaching a ceiling that will hold for the nearterm.   &quot;We're going to stop right about here and bounce&quot; in arange of 1.54 to 1.58 marks, he predicts.   Like some other currency specialists, he sees the dollardeflating like a popped balloon if U.S. economic reportsdon't show any signs of improvement and bullish sentimentfizzles.   &quot;As soon as people realize the economy's not going torebound too much,&quot; the dollar will drop toward 1.50 marks,Mr. Horner says.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $369.70 an ounce, up $2.80.   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at$368.50 an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
