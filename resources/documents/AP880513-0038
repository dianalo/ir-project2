Judge Liam Hamilton of the anti-terrorist Special Criminal Courton Thursday cleared Clare O'Hare, 27, of a charge of falselyimprisoning 38-year-old dentist John O'Grady.   He said the prosecution had not proven that Mrs. O'Hare, who isseven months pregnant, knew of the kidnapping.   Dessie O'Hare, 29, was sentenced last month to 40 years inprison on charges of falsely imprisoning the dentist andmaliciously wounding him.   Police said a five-man gang led by O'Hare chopped off the tipsof two of O'Grady's fingers during the dentist's 22 days incaptivity.   O'Grady was freed by police in a Dublin house on Nov. 5.   O'Hare is a former member of the Irish Republican Army and IrishNational Liberation Army, which are fighting to ridProtestant-dominated Northern Ireland of British rule.</TEXT></DOC>
