DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia and his wife wereindicted Monday on bribery, extortion and conspiracy charges in theWedtech corruption scandal, accused among other things of acceptinga diamond-and-emerald necklace from the company's founder.   Garcia, 55, and his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, 48, were accused ofextorting $76,000 in payments from Wedtech Corp., as well as a$20,000 interest-free loan from one-time Wedtech vice chairman MarioMoreno.   In addition, the Garcias were accused of taking $77,500 and thenecklace from Wedtech founder John Mariotta and his wife, Jennie, in1985.   None of the payments, the loan or the jewelry was reported onGarcia's congressional financial disclosure forms in 1984 and 1985,according to the seven-count indictment.   Attorney Ralph Vallone Jr., 41, of Santurce, Puerto Rico, wasaccused of funneling $86,100 in Wedtech payments through his lawoffice to Mrs. Garcia as ``consulting fees,'' passing on $76,000 andkeeping $10,100 for himself.   Wedtech, now out of business, was a tiny South Bronx machine shopthat grew into a multimilion-dollar-a-year defense contractorthrough a Small Business Administration program that allowedminority-owned firms to obtain government contracts withoutcompetitive bidding.   Vallone and the Garcias face a maxium penalty of up to 20 yearsin prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted of extortion, the mostserious charge. They all face maximum penalties of two to 15 yearsin prison on additional charges of conspiracy, bribe receiving andreceipt of an illegal gratuity.   They are to be arraigned Dec. 1.   Garcia, Mariotta and Moreno met with the governor of Puerto Ricoin 1985, the indictment said, although the governor was not accusedof any wrongdoing.   The indictment charged that on Aug. 2, 1985, Garcia met withMoreno in his Bronx congressional office, and allegedly directed theWedtech executive to make the $20,000 loan through Garcia's sister,the Rev. Aimee Cortese.   This was done, the indictment said, ``so that it would falselyappear that Aimee Cortese, not Mario Moreno, was the source of theloan.''   Ms. Cortese was pastor of the Cross Road Tabernacle.   The loan was repaid in two $10,000 payments, the indictment said.   Neither Garcia nor his attorney, Robert Morvillo, was availablefor comment, but Garcia issued a statement through spokesman BillDanvers.   ``I am grateful that this period of trial by grand jury leaks isfinally over,'' the statement said. ``I note that despite aninvestigation which has lasted nearly two years and has scrutinizedvirtually every facet of my personal and professional life, thecharges deal only with the preposterous allegations of Mario Moreno,one of the most notorious felons of the 20th century.''   Moreno was one of four Wedtech officials who pleaded guilty tobribing government authorities and cooperated with prosecutors inseveral earlier Wedtech cases.   Moreno testified earlier this year at the trial of former U.S.Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-Bronx, that the company had paid $80,000 toGarcia.   The payments, for ``political favors and politicalintroductions'' allegedly were made to Garcia ``because he and hiswife requested it,'' said Moreno.   Moreno also testified about numerous alleged payoffs to bankers,businessmen, union officials and a public utility manager.   ``The overall Wedtech investigation is still continuing,'' saidU.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani.   Giuliani would not say what Garcia allegedly did in return forthe payments, saying he could not go beyond the language of theindictment, which did not specify further.   Through his spokesman, Garcia said he was innocent and vowed tofight the charges ``with all of my God-given strength.''   Garcia was re-elected earlier this month, despite continuingrumors that he would face corruption charges.   On Friday, Biaggi, another Bronx Democrat, was sentenced to eightyears in prison for his part in the Wedtech scandal.   Mariotta, Wedtech's founder, once described by President Reaganas one of the ``heroes for the '80s,'' was among those convicted ofracketeering with Biaggi. At least 19 people have been convicted inthe case to date.</TEXT></DOC>
