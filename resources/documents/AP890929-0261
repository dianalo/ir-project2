The latest fissure came two weeks ago when Bankers Trust Co. ofNew York became the first bank to announce it will manage a publicsale of corporate bonds.   Until recent years, banks were barred from most activitiesassociated with the securities business, such as selling stocks andcorporate bonds, under the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act.   Glass-Steagall was partly prompted by the banks' practice duringthe 1920s of helping companies sell stock or bonds to the public atinflated prices; the companies would then use the proceeds to repayshaky loans to the banks.   The crash of 1929 made it harder for banks to dump unsound loanson stock and bond investors. Banks also lost money on underwritingsthat weren't related to their own borrowers. The result was astring of bank failures in the 1930s.   Banks for many years have been permitted to sell low-riskTreasury bonds and general-obligation municipal bonds, but theexpanded powers granted in recent years allow banks to enter aworld forbidden to them since 1933 by Glass-Steagall.   In 1987, the Federal Reserve Board gave banks the authority tounderwrite municipal revenue bonds, commercial paper,mortgage-backed securities and securities backed by consumer loans.   In January, the Fed gave preliminary approval for Bankers Trustand four other large banks to underwrite corporate bonds. Finalapproval was given over the summer.   The call by banks for the new powers was backed by the Reaganand Bush adminstrations, which said they are needed to allow U.S.banks to compete globally.   The new banking powers are strongly opposed by the SecuritiesIndustry Association, which represents the nation's investmenthouses. The group has a lawsuit pending that is intended to repealthe Fed's actions.   The trade group contends that banks may be endangering theirdepositors' money, which is federally insured, by engaging in therisky practice of securities underwriting. The group also arguesthat if changes need to be made to Glass-Steagall, Congress shoulddo the changing, not the Fed.   ``A statute that everyone understood for almost 50 years hasbeen literally gutted by regulators,'' said Don Crawford, a vicepresident of the trade group.   The Fed's actions also have a number of congressional critics.After the Fed gave its preliminary approval to bank bondunderwriting, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee, compared it to inviting banks ``toshoot craps with the taxpayers' money.''   ``This is the kind of irresponsible behavior that gave us thesavings and loan crisis and brought about the 1929 crash,'' he said.   The Fed placed a number of restrictions on the sale of bonds bybanks. One requires that this underwriting be done by separatelycapitalized subsidiaries so that deposits are not put at risk. TheFed also effectively restricted bond underwriting to the nation'slargest banks.   Bankers Trust announced last month that it will underwrite a$150 million junk bond issue for Morningstar Foods Inc. of Dallas,a producer and distributor of dairy products.   Some have questioned the wisdom of banks putting any of theircapital at risk in the high-risk junk bond market. The SecuritiesIndustry Association speculates that the practice may lead Congressto reexamine federal banking laws.   The American Bankers Association says such fears are unfounded.   ``There's proper safeguards,'' said Mary Liz Meany, an ABAspokeswoman, referring to the Fed's restrictions on bankunderwriting.   ABA contends that the expanded banking powers are a necessarymodernization of banking rules. However, the banking trade groupagrees that Congress, not the Fed, should be making the changes.   The banks contend that the increased competition in bondunderwriting they will bring to the market will make it cheaper forcorporations to float new bond issues.   ``Ultimately we expect to be a force in the (bond)marketplace,'' said George Fasel, vice president of corporatecommunications for Bankers Trust.   The Fed has indicated it will decide by early next year whetherthey also may also underwrite stock issues.   The brokerage firms contend that the eventual outcome of theexpanded bank powers will be the destruction of the securitiesindustry.   ``There will be no problem with a bank the size of Citibankgoing out and buying Merrill Lynch,'' Crawford said.   He said that when Canada's equivalent of Glass-Steagall wasrepealed a few years ago, banks went on a buying spree. Today, hesaid, there are few broker-dealers in Canada that aren't owned by abank.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday Oct. 2</NOTE></DOC>
