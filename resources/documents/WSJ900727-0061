The decision, which was hailed by smoking foes andplaintiffs' attorneys, opens the door for a review of theissue by the U.S. Supreme Court. It also marks a sharp breakfrom previous circuit court rulings. In recent years, fivefederal courts and the Minnesota Supreme Court have ruledthat the 1966 federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act-- which requires warning labels on cigarette packs and incigarette advertisements -- protects the tobacco companiesfrom liability.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is precedent setting,&quot; says Marc Edell, theplaintiff's attorney, who also represented Antonio Cipollonein another landmark tobacco case last year. &quot;This is thefirst time a state supreme court has held that cigarettewarnings don't preclude plaintiffs from suing manufacturers.&quot;   Yesterday's decision stems from a lawsuit filed by ClaireDewey against Brown andamp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., AmericanBrands Inc. and RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. in 1982. Her husband,Wilfred Dewey, died of lung cancer at age 49, after smokingCamels, Tareytons and Viceroys for 40 years. The New JerseySupreme Court ruling allows Mrs. Dewey to proceed with theproduct liability case.   In the 59-page opinion, a majority of the judges foundthat Congress didn't intend to &quot;immunize&quot; cigarettemanufacturers against suits alleging that they had failed towarn consumers of the risks of smoking. If that had been theintent, Congress &quot;knew how to do so with unmistakablespecificity,&quot; the judges said.   Tobacco analysts played down the significance of the case,noting that the decision has no immediate financialimplications because Mrs. Dewey has yet to win her case.Nonetheless, tobacco stocks were buffeted yesterday. Incomposite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, AmericanBrands closed at $66.25 a share, down $3.625, and PhilipMorris Cos. finished at $47.25 a share, down $1.75. Americandepositary receipts of B.A.T Industries, the parent of Brownandamp; Williamson, fell 12.5 cents, to $10.875 a share, inAmerican Stock Exchange composite trading. RJ Reynolds isprivately held.   &quot;This is a psychological negative,&quot; said Diana Temple, ananalyst at Salomon Bros. &quot;But it's only one negative decisionin an overwhelmingly positive flow of liability decisions.&quot;Fifty-three cases are pending against the industry, down froma peak of 157 in 1986.   Longer term, however, the implications could provesignificant. Two of the three tobacco companies named in theDewey suit -- Brown andamp; Williamson and RJ Reynolds -- indicatedthey will consider appealing the decision to the U.S. SupremeCourt. Some legal experts said the high court would be likelyto accept the case.   Even if the tobacco companies accept the Dewey decision,there are six cases pending in New Jersey or federal courtthat would potentially allow plaintiffs to bring the matterbefore the Supreme Court.   A high court ruling against the tobacco industry wouldcertainly trigger a flood of new tobacco liability suits,according to some experts. &quot;If the conflict is resolvedagainst the tobacco industry, this will be very serious,&quot;predicted Calvert Crary, managing director of Labe Simpson andamp;Co. in New York. &quot;The plaintiffs will win these kinds ofcases all day long.&quot;   For their part, attorneys who represent the tobaccoindustry conceded that the justices in the Dewey case haddeparted radically from previous rulings. But Martin London,an attorney for Brown andamp; Williamson, summed up the prevailingsentiment, describing the case as &quot;aberrant.&quot; He said thecase isn't precedent setting because federal courts have soconsistently found that the federal warning law protectstobacco companies.   &quot;This isn't a chink in the industry's armour because ofits relatively limited applicability,&quot; added David Kentoff,an attorney at the Washington, D.C.-based firm of Arnold andamp;Porter, which represents Philip Morris. &quot;The decision onlyapplies to cases brought in state courts in New Jersey.&quot;   In another positive development for tobacco plaintiffs,the New Jersey justices also held that cases filed before1987 aren't affected by a state law that makes it moredifficult to file cigarette liability suits. The law shieldstobacco manufacturers from claims that cigarettes are&quot;defective&quot; products because of their health hazards.   For smoking critics, the Dewey case is especially welcomebecause it comes at a time when tobacco plaintiffs havesuffered a series of crushing defeats. Earlier this year, aMinnesota court dismissed a similar case against RJ Reynolds,ruling that the 1966 labeling act preempted claims thatcigarette makers had failed to adequately warn smokers ofhealth hazards.   In 1988, a New Jersey jury awarded $400,000 to Mr.Cipollone, whose wife had died of lung cancer, in the firstdefeat for the tobacco industry, but the verdict was laterthrown out by a federal appeals court in Philadelphia.   &quot;We've been watching one court after another come out withthe wrong decision,&quot; said Richard Daynard, chairman of thetobacco products liability project at NortheasternUniversity, an anti-smoking activist group. &quot;This is an 11thhour reprieve for tobacco liability plaintiffs.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
