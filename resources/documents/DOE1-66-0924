The settlers must be able to makea living, whether at subsistence, commercial farming, fishing, mining,manufacturing, trade, or in government service. Although most of thisdiscussion is highly speculative, it does seem from the historical materialthat there are plausible ways in which an evolutionary lunar programcould lead, step by step, to settlement. Once a lunar facility has achievedbasic self-sufficiencies in the production of oxygen, food, and constructionmaterials, crew rotation would become a dominant cost factor in continuinglunar operations. At such a point, establishment of a resident staffbegins to make economic sense. Subsequent encouragement of private-sectoreconomic activities through such mechanisms as resident bonuses, localpurchase preferences, and transfer of responsibility of basic servicesand production capabilities might well reduce operating costs and significantlymultiply the economic effects of the basic import capacity provided bythe facility's local expenditures.</TEXT></DOC>
