<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-36-0808 </DOCNO><TEXT>The chemically synthesized signal peptide (native-sequence signal peptide)of preproparathyroid hormone exhibits signal sequence-like activity byinhibiting the translocation/processing of precursor proteins to theirmature forms in an in vitro translation system. In order to prepare abiologically functional radiolabeled form of this peptide, we undertookstructure-function studies of the native-sequence signal peptide. Sinceconventional iodination of peptides is performed under oxidizing conditions,chemical design efforts were focused on the oxidation-labile residues,methionine and cysteine, present in the native sequence. Substitutionof the three methionines with norleucine and the single cysteine withalanine yielded a surfur-free analog, [Nle-(-25), Nle-(-21),Nle-(-18),Ala-(-14),D-Tyr-(+1)]pre-proPTH-(-29-+1)amide,which is resistant to oxidation and active in the inhibition of processingassay. An interaction between the signal region and one of the componentsof the intracellular secretory apparatus, signal recognition particle(SRP), was demonstrated: iodinated sulfur-free analog was cross-linked(using the homo-bifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate) to the54 kilodalton (kDa) subunit of SRP. The 68 kDa and 72 kDa subunits ofSRP were also labeled, but to a lesser extent, by the iodinated peptide.</TEXT></DOC>
