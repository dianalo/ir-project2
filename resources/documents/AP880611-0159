(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jacqueline Bliss finally attended her highschool senior prom, with her daughter as her date, two decades andthree children after she quit school to support her mother.   Sonya Bliss, 20, a senior at Hope High School in Providence,pulled up at a hotel with her mother in a gray Cadillac limousineThursday night, both of them in lace dresses.   Mrs. Bliss, 41, had never been to a prom. She left high schoolto support her mother, and went back to school to obtain a highschool equivalency diploma.   ``My mother asked me who I was going with to the prom,'' Sonyasaid, ``and I told her, `None of your business.' I finally told heron Mother's Day. She cried.''   ``I felt so good inside for a daughter to think that way,'' Mrs.Bliss said.   Family members chipped in to rent the limo and buy the corsageand prom tickets. But finding the dress wasn't as easy.   ``She wanted me to wear something with bows, like a Cinderelladress,'' Mr. Bliss said with a laugh. ``I told her it wasn'tappropriate. I'm too old for that.''   They settled on a long, black lace dress.   ``She felt I'd be embarrassed in front of the other kids tobring my mother,'' said Sonya, who is graduating after five yearsin high school. ``I could care less what they think. I love her andthat's what matters.''</TEXT></DOC>
