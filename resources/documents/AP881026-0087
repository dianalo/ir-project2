In addition, officials are trying to determine whether the deathof a fourth man, and the illness of a fifth, are linked to theothers.   ``All five knew each other and two of them said they all boughtcocaine at the same place (on the Houston waterfront),'' said RogerWhidmeyer, spokesman for Ben Taub Hospital.   He said ``a very educated guess'' is that the cocaine was heavilylaced with boric acid, adding, ``There's some coke out there that'splaying Russian roulette.''   Cocaine sometimes is cut with other substances so dealers cansell more of the illegal drug.   Boric acid is a white cystalline compound and is used as a mildantiseptic, to manufacture cements and enamels, and to kill roaches.Experts say it also can cause cardiovascular shock.   Those who died apparently had injected the drug, and two of themtold doctors they thought they had gotten ``some bad cocaine,''Whidmeyer said. They complained of tremendous dehydration, heartpalpitations and nausea.   ``They were scared,'' he said.   Two of those taken to Ben Taub died Monday and the third diedduring the night _ all unofficially from cardiac arrest and renalfailure, Whidmeyer said. The fourth person died Monday at anotherhospital.   Autopsies were being performed on the four victims, and the fifthman was in stable condition late Tuesday at Ben Taub, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
