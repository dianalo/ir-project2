They say the central bank's move to increase the discount rate bya half-percentage point to 7 percent on Friday came too late and wastoo mild to effectively quell an inflation spiral, and that furthersteps to cool the overheating economy will be necessary.   ``The Fed is signaling that it's definitely trying to encouragehigher rates in order to fight the inflationary pressure,'' saidDonald Ratajczak of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia StateUniversity.   ``The only question is whether they're signaling a little lateand a little timidly,'' he said. ``They definitely are late and ahalf-point (increase) is a little timid.''   Boosting the discount rate, the fee the central bank charges forshort-term loans to banks, is the strongest signal the Fed can sendof its concern about inflation.   The Fed also has been employing more subtle credit-tighteningmoves for the past year, reducing the availability of cash and thusdriving up the interest rates that banks charge when making loans.   Major banks last week boosted their prime rate _ charged to themost credit-worthy commercial customers _ for the second time in twoweeks to 11.5 percent as lenders continue to pass along their highercosts for funds.   A variety of lending rates covering everything from homemortgages to new cars are expected to ratchet upward as a result ofthe latest round of Fed tightening, and the pattern is expected torepeat itself.   ``Until the Fed sees some clear evidence that the economy isslowing down, it is going to continue to tighten,'' said economistDavid Wyss of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``It believesthe economy is running too fast, inflation is accelerating and it'sgoing to put on the brakes. But it takes awhile for the brakes towork.''   Higher interest rates are used to gradually moderate economicgrowth in an effort to avoid the higher prices caused by tight labormarkets and supply bottlenecks.   Concern about inflation heightened last week after the LaborDepartment reported that consumer prices were up 0.6 percent inJanuary, the biggest increase in two years. Earlier reports showedwholesale prices were up 1 percent last month and indicated theeconomy has yet to slow down in response to the Fed's efforts tomaneuver a so-called ``soft landing'' to the 6-year-old economicexpansion.   Ratajczak said that with inflation unlikely to flag in the nearfuture, interest rates are bound nowhere but up.   ``I think we're going to see some more bad inflation numbers andI think we're going to see some higher interest rates,'' he said.``Cumulatively, the higher interest rates will slow down theeconomy.''   A similar theme was sounded by economist David Jones of Aubrey G.Lanston andamp; Co. in New York, who said the Fed's latest action broughtit ``at best, roughly even with the inflation curve.''   ``The inflation numbers will continue to show a tendency toaccelerate and it will require further Fed tightening steps,'' Jonessaid.   Most economists are expecting inflation this year to be in therange of 5 percent to 5.5 percent, up from 4.4 percent in the lasttwo years. While still far short of the double-digit levels of the1970s, the current inflation rates have been labeled``unacceptable'' by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.   ``If inflation emerges, I think a recession will move up on usmuch more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will bea prolonged one,'' he warned in congressional testimony last week.   Wyss said that while boosting interest rates is not the idealcure for inflation, ``it's the only lever the Fed has.''   ``I don't think they have much alternative but to pull it.''</TEXT></DOC>
