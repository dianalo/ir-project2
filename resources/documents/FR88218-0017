In this Report and Order weeliminated a reporting requirement that is obsolete and unnecessary. Thecurrent reporting rules were promulgated in 1941 and have never been amended.Pursuant to andSection; 43.71, reports are filed twice a year covering theperiods January through June and July through December respectively. Eightcompanies filed reports for 1986. They were Atlantic Marine Communications,Global Marine Communications, Inc., ITT World Communications, Inc., MobileMarine Radio, Inc., Radio KLC, Inc., RCA Global Communications Corp., SeattleMarine Radio, and TRT Telecommunication Corp. Revenues earned by the reportingcarriers, for this radiotelegraph service during 1986, ranged from lessthan $50,000 to a high of slightly greater than $4 million. To further reduce unnecessary regulatory paperwork, we eliminated andSection;43.71 reports. The information in the reports has only been used by thisCommission on an infrequent and limited basis. We do not copile or publishany information from these reports. Summary data are included in the annualreports filed by radiotelegraph, ocean-cable, and wire-telegraph carriers.Eliminating the andSection; 43.71 reports does not preclude us from directingthe affected carriers to file detailed information should the need arise.We believe that most of our needs for data are adequately met with otherreports. When necessary, special data requests can be tailored to specificneeds. Since there is no ongoing need for semi-annual data, special studieswill eliminate the need for carriers operating public coast stations engagedin radiotelegraph communications with maritime mobile stations to submitreports semi-annually. This will not only reduce the costs to the carriers,it will also reduce this Commission's costs. The proposal contained herein has been analyzed with respect to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 and found to reduce information collection requirementson the public. In compliance with the provisions of section 605(b) of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we certify that the elimination of the andSection;43.71 reports will not have a significant economic impact and will easethe recordkeeping and reporting requirement of these carriers. The rationalefor the elimination is outlined in the above discussions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Ordering Clauses </ITAG>Accordingly, it is ordered, that pursuant to the provisions of sections4(i), 219, 220, 403 and 404 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,47 U.S.C. 154(i), 219, 220, 403 and 404, and section 553 of the AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, the policies discussed herein are adopted,and that andSection; 43.71 is eliminated as set forth in the Appendix, effectiveupon publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. It is further ordered, that this proceedingis hereby terminated. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 43 </ITAG>Communications common carrier, Reporting requirements, Public coast stationoperators. <ITAG tagnum="6">H.
