The mainpurpose of the project is to develop a low cost computer system witha processing rate of a few tens of millions of operations per second.The system solves many problems of data analysis from high-energy physicsspectrometers. It includes about 70 MOTOROLA-68020 based powerful slavemicroprocessor boards liaisoned through the VME crates to a host VAXmicro computer. Each single microprocessor board performs the same algorithmrequiring large computing time. The host computer distributes data overthe microprocessor board, collects and combines obtained results. Thearchitecture of the system easily allows one to use it in the real timemode. 4 refs.; 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
