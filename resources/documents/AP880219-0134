The Oppressed of the Earth accused Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,43, of using his leadership of a group attached to the U.N. InterimForce in Lebanon to mask undercover work for the CIA.   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman denied Thursdaythat Higgins had any links with the CIA.   In a rescue attempt, Shiite Amal militiamen today seized sixactivists of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in thesouthern port of Tyre. The Amal sealed off a 300-square-mile area.   The Amal, the main Shiite militia in Lebanon, is headed byLebanese Justice Minister Nabih Berri. It has fighting Hezbollahfor control of southern Lebanon.   The claim by Oppressed of the Earth was made in a typedArabic-language statement delivered to a Western news agency inBeirut. It was accompanied by two identity cards, one in Englishand one in Hebrew.   Both bore photographs of Higgins, a native of Danville, Ky., andwhat appeared to be his signature.   It was the second claim of responsibility for Wednesday'sabduction. The first was made by a previously unknown group callingitself the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades.   ``William Higgins, agent of the Central Intelligence Agency whouses his U.N. observer's work as a cover for his dangerousespionage role, is in the hands of our heroic Mujahedeen (HolyWarriors),'' the statement said.   The group said it would release Higgins following a completeIsraeli withdrawal from its security zone in south Lebanon. It alsodemanded the release of an estimated 300 Lebanese and Palestinianprisoners held in Khiam detention camp in south Lebanon and theimmediate cessation of U.S. activity in Lebanon.   Oppressed of the Earth is believed made up of Shiite Moslemzealots loyal to Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini.   It has claimed responsibility for hijackings, bombings and andkidnappings including the abduction of 12 Lebanese Jews in Moslemwest Beirut since 1984, eight of whom it said it killed.   Oppressed of the Earth also claims to have staged the June 1985hijacking of a TWA jetliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.   During the hijacking, the captors demanded Israel free severalhundred Arabs it held. Although Israel denied any deal was made,prisoners were released in batches in the weeks that followed theAmericans' release.   In Washington, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said today U.S.officials are studying whether Americans should be withdrawn fromthe U.N. observer group in light of Higgins' abduction.   But later, President Reagan said Americans will not bewithdrawn. ``No. We are going to meet our obligations to the UnitedNations,'' he said during a White House photo session.   Carlucci, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, said``everything possible'' is being done to secure Higgins' release.   Higgins, a decorated Vietnam veteran, heads a 76-man observergroup that operates along the Lebanon-Israel border and has itsheadquarters in Jerusalem.   He was kidnapped by gunmen as he was driving from Tyre to UNIFILheadquarters in the border town of Naqoura. At the time he wasviolating U.N. rules for travel by Americans.   An Amal spokesman said the Hezbollah fundamentalists wererounded up in pre-dawn raids on houses in the port city.   ``We suspect they were monitoring Higgins' movements in Tyrebefore his abduction. They will be interrogated,'' said thespokesman, who refused to be identified.   ``We want Higgins back and we have no red line as far as hiscase is concerned,'' Amal's military commander, Daoud Daoud, saidThursday.   Today, Daoud told reporters: ``We have clear clues about theidentity of the kidnappers. We're still optimistic.'' He did notelaborate.   The comment came after a 30-minute meeting between Amal'smilitary, security and political chiefs in Tyre and senior UNIFILcommanders.   The abduction brings the number of foreign hostages in Lebanonto 25, including nine Americans. Most are believed held bypro-Iranian Shiite extremists.   On Thursday, a man speaking Arabic telephoned a Western newsagency in Beirut, said the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades hadkidnapped Higgins and accused him of being a CIA agent. He did notidentify himself.   When Higgins was seized, he was violating U.N. rules for travelby Americans in dangerous areas, UNIFIL spokesman Timur Gokselsaid. But, the spokesman added, the colonel ``felt he couldn'tabide by these restrictions.   ``Higgins felt that as chief, he should be out with his men andknow what they are doing.''   American members of U.N. forces are restricted to theheadquarters area and are permitted to travel in Lebanon only witha U.N. military escort, he said.   Higgins was the third U.N. official kidnapped in Lebanon thismonth.   The other two, a Swede and Norwegian of the U.N. Relief andWorks Agency, were seized Feb. 5. After that abduction, the U.N.put plans to revive a development program in Lebanon on hold.   Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, is the longest held of all the hostages. He wasabducted March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
