ITC Recommendation </ITAG>In its Fourth Report to EPA, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of June 1, 1979 (44 FR 31866), the ITC recommendedthat all chemicals in the category defined as ``aniline and anilines substitutedin one or more positions with a chloro, bromo, or nitro group, or any combinationof one or more of these substituent groups'' be considered for health effects,chemical fate and environmental effects testing. The ITC recommended testingfor chronic health effects with emphasis on blood and nervous system disorders,teratogenicity, carcincogenicity, mutagenic effects, and epidemiology studies.The ITC also recommended chemical fate and environmental effects testing.In response to the ITC, EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(ANPR) for the anilines category (49 FR 108, January 3, 1984). In the ANPR,EPA identified 20 individual chemicals in production in 1982, reviewedthe available health and environmental effects information on the chemicals,indicated tentative data gaps in available health and environmental effectsinformation, and requested public comments on a scheme to test representativecategory members rather than all category members. The ANPR named six subcategories(aniline, monochloroanilines, polychloroanilines, mononitroanilines, polynitroanilines,and halo-nitroanilines) and seven representative subcategory members (aniline;4-chloroaniline; 3,4-dichloroaniline; 4-nitroaniline; 2,4-dinitroaniline;2-chloro-4-nitroaniline; and 2-bromo-4,6-dinitroaniline) for possible healthand environmental effects testing consideration under section 4(a)(1)(A)of TSCA. In response to the ANPR, EPA received comments and new informationfrom the Aniline Association and the Substituted Anilines Task Force (SATF),an industry group organized as a special project of the Synthetic OrganicChemical Manufacturers Association, whose members manufacture or importone or more of the substituted anilines (Refs. 1 and 2). Comments werealso received from Sodyeco Inc., Eastman Kodak, and Upjohn Company (Refs.3 through 5). The Aniline Association and SATF provided results of surveysof processors to determine the potential for human exposure and environmentalrelease. The exposure and release data supplied by the SATF and some ofthe data supplied by the Aniline Association were submitted as ConfidentialBusiness Information (CBI) (Refs. 6 and 7).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Testing Consent Order Negotiations</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 11, 1986 (51 FR 28758) and in accordancewith the procedures established in 40 CFR 790.28, EPA requested that personsinterested in participating in or monitoring testing negotiations on anilineand seven substituted anilines contact the Agency. EPA held public meetingson August 12, 1986; October 14, 1986; January 15, 1987; and February 19,1987 to discuss testing appropriate for these eight chemicals. On or beforeJuly 7, 1988, five manufacturers of aniline and four manufacturers of substitutedanilines signed eight separate Testing Consent Orders with EPA. Under oneOrder, the five manufacturers of aniline agreed to conduct or provide forthe conduct of the following tests: <T3>In vivo</T3> mouse micronucleus assay, grammarid acute effects test,and daphnid chronic effects test. Under seven separate Orders, the manufacturersof the seven substituted anilines agreed to conduct or provide for theconduct of the following tests for each of the substituted anilines theymanufacture: <T3>In vivo</T3> cytogenetics (<T3>in vivo</T3> mouse micronucleus assay) for 2-chloroaniline, 4-chloroaniline,3,4-dichloroaniline, 2-nitroaniline, 4-nitroaniline, 2,4-dinitroaniline;gammarid acute effects, daphnid chronic effects, and rainbow trout acuteeffects (with trigger to rainbow trout early-life stage) for 2-chloroaniline;and algae acute effects, daphnid acute effects (with trigger to grammaridacute and daphnid chronic effects), and rainbow trout early life-stagetest for 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline. The test standards to be followedand the testing schedule for each test are specified in each Order.

Technical Summary</ITAG>A. Manufacture, Use And ReleaseAniline is produced by five manufacturers (DuPont, First Mississippi Corp.,Rubicon, Mobay Chemical Corp., and U.S.S. Chemical Corp.) at five locationsin the United States. Production was about 790 million pounds in 1984 (Ref.1). The production volumes for substituted anilines range from less than1000 pounds to 10 million pounds. The manufacturers of the substitutedanilines have provided EPA with exact production volumes for 1982 as CBI(Ref. 8). The TSCA section 8(b) confidential chemical inventory updatereports that there has not been a significant increase in production ofthese chemicals from levels reported in 1982.The manufacturers and processors of aniline and substituted anilines reportthat the chemicals are used consumptively as chemical intermediates (Refs.7 and 9). Aniline is used to produce isocyanates, rubber processing chemicals,dyes, and hydroquinone, for drug manufacture, and for other uses includingproduction of herbicides, synthetic fibers, and photographic chemicals.The primary use for most of the substituted anilines is as intermediatesin dye and pigment production. 3,4-Dichloroaniline and 2-chloroanilineare used primarily as pesticide intermediates. 4-Nitro-aniline and 2-nitroanilineare used solely as intermediates for phenylenediamines.Manufacturers of aniline report that approximately 2.5 million pounds weredisposed of by deep well injection, 2.5 million pounds were incinerated,130,000 pounds went to regulated landfills, 49,500 pounds were releasedto air, and 14,700 pounds were released to water. The manufacturers ofaniline have provided to EPA site-specific aquatic release volumes for1984 as CBI (Ref. 10). Total estimated aquatic release of aniline by processorswas 85,155 pounds at 22 locations with the range of location-specific releasebetween 22,000 pounds (3 locations) and 1,000 pounds or less (14 locations)(Ref. 11). Both manufacturers and processors of substituted anilines haveprovided EPA with release volumes for 1982 as CBI.B. Human Exposure1. <T3>Occupational exposure.</T3>_a. <T3>Aniline. </T3>The Aniline Association has provided EPA with informationon potential occupational exposure from aniline manufacturing and processingoperations (Refs. 1 and 7). The Association reports that there is littleor no occupational exposure to aniline because: Few workers are potentiallyexposed for short periods; production occurs in an enclosed, continuousprocess mostly in open-design plants (plant not enclosed in a building);and rigorous workplace controls and industrial hygiene practices are usedto protect workers from the known acute toxic effects of aniline. Also,most manufacturers and processors require that employees wear rubber suitsand gloves for protection in potential exposure situations such as reactorentry, special work procedures, and sampling and maintenance operations,because the greatest potential for exposure is through dermal contact (anilineis absorbed very rapidly through the skin). Air monitoring and medicalsurveillance results show control practices are effectively preventingexposures to aniline (Ref. 1). Aniline has excellent acute indicator properties;the olfactory detection level is 0.5 to 1 ppm, and acute exposure causescyanosis, a condition evidenced by bluish skin discoloration due to deficientblood oxygenation.The Aniline Association survey data reported that 487 workers involvedin manufacturing are potentially exposed to airborne aniline concentrationlevels between 0.001 to 1.4 ppm, with 97 percent of workers below 1 ppm.An additional 1,524 workers involved in internal and outside processingof aniline are potentially exposed to levels ranging from 0.001 to 5 ppmwith 99.9 percent of total worker hours at exposures below 2 ppm. The OccupationalSafety and Health Administration's (OSHA) inspection summary data time-weightedaverages (TWA) were all below 0.25 ppm and serve to support the Association'sconclusions (Ref. 12). The OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL) for anilineis 5 ppm (Ref. 13). The American Conference of Governmental IndustrialHygienists (ACGIH) TWA recommended exposure limit is 2 ppm for aniline(Ref. 14).b. <T3>Substituted anilines. </T3>The SATF has provided EPA with confidentialinformation on potential occupational exposure from manufacturing and processingoperations of substituted anilines (Refs. 6 and 8). The SATF also reportsthat there is little or no occupational exposure to the substituted anilinescurrently in production because very few employees are potentially exposed.The SATF reports that production occurs over short time periods in a closedcontinuous process during which the chemical is consumed; that workplacecontrols and industrial hygiene practices are used to protect workers fromthe known or suspected acute toxic effects of the substituted anilines,and that air monitoring and medical surveillance results show control practicesare effectively preventing exposures to the substituted anilines. Somesubstituted anilines also have excellent acute effects indicator propertieslike those of aniline.A study by one manufacturer/processor to evaluate the effects of potentialairborne exposure of manufacturing workers to 4-chloroaniline on variousbiological (blood) parameters reported that: (1) All the methemoglobinlevels measured fall within what has been traditionally regarded as a normalrange, (2) a small statistically significant elevation in methemoglobinfollowing the work shift was observed among employees involved in 4-chloroanilinemanufacture and the matched comparison group suggesting the observed increasein methemoglobin among workers may not be work-related, and (3) there wasno correlation between post-exposure methemoglobin and 4-chloroanilineair sampling data within the narrow range of low level exposures typicalin this work setting (Ref. 15). A major manufacturer/processor of chloro-and nitroanilines reports an average of 3 cases per year or methemoglobinemia,defined as oxygen saturation below 90 percent, observed at the their mainplant over the last 10 years (Ref. 16). Over the last 5 years, no methemoglobinemiawas observed.2. <T3>Consumer exposure.</T3> There is no known or suspected consumer exposureto any of the aniline category members as a result of TSCA-covered activitiesbecause they are wholly consumed chemical intermediates.C. Environmental ExposureThere are few monitoring data available for aniline and the substitutedanilines in wastewater of sediment. Ewing et al. in 1977 sampled surfacewaters from 204 sites near heavily industrialized areas across the U.S.Aniline and substituted anilines were not detected at concentrations above1 ppb (Ref. 17). In another study wastewater, receiving waters and sedimentsnear a plant manufacturing a broad range of chemicals were analyzed fororganic pollutants (Ref. 18). One sample of wastewater contained 0.02 ppmof aniline. Aniline was not detected in river water or sediments. Chloroaniline(isomers unspecified) was not detected in wastewater or river water butwas found in sediment at 1 to 2 ppm. Plant and sampling locations werenot reported.Games and Hites in 1977 measured organic compounds in untreated and treatedeffluent originating from a dye manufacturing plant (Ref. 19). Resultsshowed the presence of six aniline compounds. The compounds included aniline,chloroaniline, dichloroaniline, nitroaniline, tribromoaniline and bromodinitroaniline.The concentrations ranged from 36 to 480 ppb for raw wastewater to 7 to96 ppb for treated effluent.USEPA data in the STORET system include a total of 46 data points or observationson environmental levels of aniline in streams, and 42 data points or observationson levels of 2-nitroaniline in streams (Ref. 20) The mean residual levelof aniline was 9.47 ppb, with maximum and minimum values of 13 and 1 ppb,respectively; the STORET data were collected between August 1978 and August1980. The mean residual level for 2-nitroaniline was 0.39 ppb with maximumand minimum values of 1.7 and 0.1 ppb, respectively; the STORET data werecollected between January 1983 and May 1985.D.

The calculated and experimentalvalues indicate that, under equilibrium conditions, aniline, the chloroanilines,and the nitroanilines will remain in the water compartment, although otherdata suggest that anilines will bind chemically to sediment (see Unit III.D.3). 2. <T3>Soil mobility. </T3>The adsorption properties of aniline and some substitutedanilines have been reported and EPA has estimated soil organic-carbon sorptioncoefficients (Koc) from calculated log P values using equations developedby Kenaga, and Kenaga and Goring (Refs. 25 and 26). (See table for thesevalues.) The measured and estimated Koc values indicate that aniline andsubstituted anilines adsorb weakly to moderately to organic matter in soiland sediment and therefore can be considered moderately to highly mobile.However, there are experimental data to indicate that 4-chloroaniline and3,4-chloroaniline and other aromatic amines chemically bind to organicsin soil and sediment; therefore these and possibly other category membersmay be much less mobile in soil and sediment than predicted by the Koc(Refs. 27 through 31).  3. <T3>Presistence. </T3>Chemical fate data on aniline indicate that it isreadily biodergradable and oxidizable in surface water and sewage sludge(Refs. 32 through 35). The overall experimental degradation half-life insurface water is less than 1 day (Refs. 36 and 43).  Data on 2-chloroaniline, 4-chloroaniline, and 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA)indicate the major reaction in soil is chemical binding with the humicacid fraction (Refs. 27 through 31). After binding, the chloroaniline arenot extractable as such. As the concentration of the chemicals in the soilincreases, polymerization of these chemicals also occurs. The humic adsorptionproperties of the chloroanilines are believed to correlate with the organiccontent and pH of the soil (Ref. 37). Microbial metabolism occurs slowlyin soil because the chloroanilines bind to soil organics (Refs. 38 through42). The chloroanilines have relatively low log P values and are thereforenot likely to bioconcentrate in fatty tissue of aquatic organisms, althoughtheir lower water solubilities and higher log P values indicate they aremore likely to do so than aniline.  Photodegradation is likely to be a primary route of aquatic degradationof the chloroanilines (Refs. 43 through 45). The experimental half-lifeof DCA in distilled water, natural sea water, and Instant Ocean is lessthan 1 day (Ref. 43). The rates of biodegradation of monochloroanilinesare estimated to be slower than aniline in the aquatic environment (Ref.46). In aerobic environments 4-chloroaniline biodegrades faster than DCA.In anaerobic environments the reverse is true (Ref. 47). Some monochloroanilinesare reported to be degraded in activated sludge (Refs. 33 and 47).Available data on the chemical fate of the nitroanilines and halogenatednitroanilines are limited. In semicontinuous activated sludge testing,4-nitroaniline has been described as readily degradable and 2-nitroanilineas resistant to degradation (Ref. 48). 4-nitroaniline and 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline(DCNA) undergo microbial degradation in pure culture (Refs. 49 and 50).The relatively low log P values indicate the nitroanilines and halogenatednitroanilines are not likely to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. Thenitroanilines and halogenated nitroanilines may, like other aromatic amines,chemically bind to organics in soils and sediments, although there areno data to confirm this effect for these chemicals. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Testing Program </ITAG>A. Environmental Effects  In its Fourth Report to the EPA, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of June 1, 1979 (44 FR 31866), the ITC recommendedchemical fate testing because of suspected environmental effects and alsobecause there were conflicting reports on the ability of animals, plants,and microbes to metabolize and tolerate these chemicals. The ITC recommendedenvironmental effects testing because reports of occurrences of residuesand their persistence in water and soil suggested a highly dispersive dischargeinto the environment and available data raised a concern that categorymembers may produce adverse effects.  Using CBI supplied by manufacturers and processors and information fromthe open literature, EPA has calculated worst-case aquatic predicted environmentalconcentrations (PECs) for aniline, 2-chloroaniline, and 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline,which were the category members judged to be released in significant amounts(Ref. 51). Because the Agency has few data on the fate of the substitutedanilines in the environment, calculation of their PECs was based on theworst-case assumption that none of the substituted anilines are affectedby physical or biological processes other than dilution in the dischargeenvironment. For aniline, PECs were calculated using a measured overalldegradation half-life of 17.5 hours (\3/4\ day) which includes biodegradation,oxidation, photolysis, and hydrolysis in natural waters (Ref. 52). In addition,the concentration in the discharge environment was conservatively basedon the lowest river flow rate that would not be exceeded 5 percent of thetime. The PECs for aniline and the substituted anilines judged to be releasedin significant amounts are not described here because they are derivedfrom CBI data.  The Agency has reviewed the available data on environmental effects andthe potential for environmental exposure to other anilines category memberscurrently in production (see Notice of Termination of Rulemaking for CertainAnilines Category Members appearing elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>). The Agency has determined that, given the lowanticipated and observed exposure to these chemicals and in the light ofthe environmental effects data available for this category, these chemicalsdo not reach levels in the environment that raise a concern for adverseeffects. EPA has estimated the potential for releases of anilines category membersto adversely affect aquatic organisms by examining available aquatic toxicitydata and by comparing acute vertebrate and invertebrate LC50's to the site-specificPECs calculated as described in Unit IV.A.2. EPA has determined that concentrations of aniline, 2-chloroaniline, andDCNA in the aquatic environment resulting from manufacturing and processingcould reach levels which may be harmful to aquatic organisms (i.e., LC50'sof sensitive aquatic species of aniline, 2-chloroaniline, and DCNA arelikely to be less than or equal to 1000 andmultiply; the predicted environmentalconcentrations or less than or equal to 1 mg/L). Therefore, additionalacute toxicity testing is needed to determine the effects of: Aniline ondaphnids, 2-chloroaniline on gammarids and rainbow trout, and DCNA on algaeand daphnids with trigger to gammarids. Testing to determine the chroniceffects of aniline on dephanids, 2-chloroaniline from acute trigger todaphnid or gammarid and rainbow trout early life stage, and DCNA earlylife stage in rainbow trout is also needed to assess the potential long-termhazard of these chemicals to aquatic organisms. The following is a summary of available aquatic effects information theAgency has considered in its decision to issue a Consent Order for aquaticeffects testing of aniline, 2-chloroaniline, and 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline.The 96-hour EC50 for aniline in freshwater algae (<T3>Selenastrum capricornutum</T3>) is 19 mg/L and the 48-hour EC50 for2-chloroaniline in freshwater algae (<T3>Scenedesmus pannonicus</T3>) is 32 mg/L (Refs. 53 and 54). The 48-hourLC50 for aniline in <T3>Daphnia magna </T3> is 0.65 mg/L and the 48-hour EC50 for 2-chloroanilinein Daphnia magna is 0.46 mg/L (Refs. 55 and 54). The 96-hour LC50's foraniline and 2-chloroaniline in fathead minnows are 134 mg/L and 5.8 mg/L,respectively (Ref. 56). The 96-hour LC50 for aniline in rainbow trout is8 mg/L (Ref. 57). The 96-hour LC50's for 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline inbluegill sunfish and rainbow trout are 1.08 mg/L and 0.56 mg/L, respectively(Refs. 58 and 59). B. Health Effects  In its Fourth Report 44 FR 31866, the ITC recommended that all chemicalsin the anilines category be tested for chronic health effects with emphasison blood and nervous system disorders, teratogenicity, caricinogenicity,mutagenic effects, and epidemiology studies. The ITC based its recommendationsfor chronic health effects (with emphasis on blood and nervous system disorders),for teratogenic effects testing, and for epidemiology studies on the potentialfor some category members to cause methemoglobinemia in humans. The ITCrecommended mutagenic and carcinogenic effects testing because some categorymembers were reported to cause mutagenic and/or carcinogenic effects, andthe results raise a suspicion of these effects in untested members. TheAgency in its ANPR for the aniline category, 49 FR 108, proposed testingfor reproductive effects based on the potential for some category membersto cause methemoglobinemia in humans.  The Agency has reviewed the available data on health effects and the potentialfor human exposure to the seven anilines category members named in theConsent Orders and the other anilines category members currently in production(see Notice of Termination of Rulemaking for Certain Anilines CategoryMembers appearing elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>). The Agency has determined that, given the lowanticipated and observed exposure to these chemicals and in light of thehealth effects data available for the category, these chemicals do notreach levels in the workplace environment that raise a concern for chronic,developmental, and reproductive effects.  However, potential human exposure to aniline, 2-chloroaniline, 4-chloroaniline,3,4-dichloroaniline, 2-nitroaniline, 4-nitroaniline, and 2,4-dinitroanilineresulting from manufacturing and processing is sufficient to raise a concernfor effects on human health through adverse heritable mutagenic effects.Therefore, additional testing to characterize the mutagenicity for sevencategory members is necessary.  This additional testing is necessary as part of a tiered testing approachwhich involves a program review to follow the development of the in vivocytogenetics data and considers all available mutagenic and health effectsdata to determine the need for further mutagenic effects or other healtheffects testing. EPA is deferring any decision as to the need for carcinogenicitytesting of the substituted anilines until it has received the results fromall the mutagenicity testing to be performed under the Consent Orders.Data on the carcinogenic potential of aniline has been evaluated and judgedto be adequate. The Agency will announce its decision on further mutagenicityor carcinogenicity testing needs in a separate rulemaking.  The following is a summary of available health effects information theAgency has considered in its decision to issue Consent Orders only formutagenic effects testing of seven anilines category members. 1. <T3>Acute effects. </T3>The primary acute effect in mammals associatedwith exposure to aniline and some substituted anilines is an increase inmethemoglobin levels in blood (Ref. 60). However, a recent study sponsoredby American Hoechst shows that not all substituted anilines readily causeincreased levels of methemoglobin in rats (Ref. 61). The study was designedto rate the methemoglobin-inducing potency of category members relativeto aniline, using high doses to maximize the amount of methemoglobin produced.Doses were equimolar to 100 and 400 mg/kg of aniline. When test compoundsinduced the formation of methemoglobin above vehicle controls in a dose-dependentmanner they were considered positive. For compounds classified as positive,the results of the 100 mg/kg equimolar does at 1 hour were then statisticallycompared with the 100 mg/kg aniline results to determine if the test compoundwas more potent, equipotent, or less potent than aniline. Test compoundsthat failed to induce methemoglobinemia at either time point (1 hour and6 hours) or dose were considered negative.  Only 3-chloroaniline and 4-chloroaniline were significantly more potentmethemoglobin producers than aniline. Four chemicals were equipotent toaniline: 3-nitroaniline, 4-nitroaniline, 2,4-dinitroaniline, and 3,4-dichloroaniline;and four were less potent than aniline: 2-chloroaniline, 4-chloro-3-nitroaniline,2,3-dichloroaniline, and 3,5-dichloroaniline. The other eleven chemicalswere negative.Numerous reports and studies describe secondary effects from acute humanand animal exposure to aniline, 4-chloroaniline, and 4-nitroaniline relatedto methemoglobinemia and resulting anoxia (Ref. 62). The secondary effectsinclude cyanosis, and central nervous system symptoms which result fromthe decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of methemoglobic blood. Changesin blood chemistry and development of Heinz bodies also occur. Removalfrom exposure usually allows a normalization of hematologic conditions,followed by amelioration of secondary abnormalities.2. <T3>Metabolism. </T3>Studies on the disposition and metabolism of aniline,4-chloroaniline, 4-nitroaniline, 2,4-dinitroaniline, 2-bromo-4,6-dinitroaniline,2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline, and 4-chloro-2-nitroaniline in rats indicatethese chemicals are rapidly metabolized and excreted (Refs. 63 through68). For example, the whole body half-life of these chemicals ranges from1 to 7 hours; and within 2 to 3 days, clearance of chemical-derived radioactivityfrom the body was almost complete.Aniline and some of the substituted members of the category (2-chloroaniline,3-chloroaniline, 4-chloroaniline, 2,3-dichlororaniline, 2,4-dichloroaniline,3,4-dichloroaniline, 3-nitroaniline, 4-nitroaniline, and 4-chloro-3-nitroaniline)are biotransformed in rats and other mammals into intermediates which initiatethe formation of methemoglobin from hemoglobin (Ref. 60). There are twometabolic pathways involved in the metabolism of aniline and the othermethemoglobin-forming members: (1) The hydroxylation of the aromatic ringcarbons to produce phenols which are the precursors for conjugated productsexcreted in urine or bile or (2) the hydroxylation of the nitrogen atomto form phenylhydroxylamine and nitrosobenzene which convert hemoglobinto an oxidized form, methemoglobin, an irreversible oxygen carrier. However,the sensitivity to methemoglobin-forming anilines varies among mammals.Cats are the most sensitive and produce the highest and most sustainedlevels of methemoglobin. Humans, dogs, rats, and rabbits are less sensitive(order of decreasing sensitivities). The variation in sensitivity couldbe due to the extent to which the chemical is metabolized to phenylhydroxylamineor to the differences in the activities of enzymes that promote the reductionof methemoglobin in the red cell back to hemoglobin.3. <T3>Subchronic and chronic effects. </T3>Results from prechronic or subchronicand chronic (oncogenicity) oral studies in rats or rats and mice for threemethemoglobin-inducing chemicals (aniline, 4-chloroaniline, and 4-nitroaniline)have been reported (Refs. 69 through 75). Some common effects that resultfrom long term exposure to aniline and 4-chloroaniline at doses (10 to100 mg/kg/day) that induce significant methemoglobin include: Anemia, redblood cell Heinz bodies, dose-related increase in spleen weight and size,dose-related congestion of splenic pulp, increased red blood cell turnoverrate, and dose-related increased pigment (hemosiderin engorgement) in spleenand in kidney and liver at high doses (andgreater; 10 mg/kg/day). At higherdoses (30 to 100 mg/kg/day), a dose-dependent increased incidence of primarysplenic sarcomas, principally in male rats, was reported for aniline and4-chloroaniline (Refs. 69 and 75).Results of a chronic oral study in rats using 4-nitroaniline indicate theadministration of 4-nitroaniline at levels up to 9 mg/kg/day for 2 yearsdid not cause any treatment-related oncogenic effects (Ref. 74). The studywas designed to determine whether chronic or oncogenic effects occur fromlong-term exposure to 4-nitroaniline at doses that induce increased levelsof methemoglobin in rats. Methemoglobin levels were increased over controlsat mid (1.5 mg/kg/day) and high (9.0 mg/kg/day) dosage levels. Slight anemiawas observed mainly at the high dosage level. At the low (0.25 mg/kg/day)dosage level, the only treatment-related change was slight brown pigmentin splenic reticuloendothelial cells. The only treatment-related changeat the mid and high dosage levels was accumulation of brown pigment insinusoidal macrophages in the liver and in reticuloendothelial cells inthe spleen. Results of an oral 90-day subchronic study in mice using 4-nitroanilinehave been reported. Effects in both sexes given 30 and 100 mg/kg/day include:Methemoglobinemia, Heinz bodies, increased red blood cell turn over rate,increased spleen and liver weight, and pigment deposition within phagocyticcells of spleen, bone marrow and liver (Ref. 74). The National ToxicologyProgram (NTP) is sponsoring an oral chronic effects-oncogenicity studyof 4-nitroaniline in mice at dose levels of 0, 3, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day(Ref. 76).Subchronic inhalation studies using rats and mice with the methemoglobininducers 3-chloroaniline, 3,4-dichloroaniline, and 4-nitroaniline reportthe same type of effects that occur at lower doses and over shorter exposureperiods in oral studies in rats and mice (Refs. 77 through 81). Subchronicoral exposure of rats to 4-chloro-3-nitroaniline resulted in reduced testes-weight-to-brain-weightratio at 18 mg/kg/day and testicular atrophy along with other toxic effectsat 90 mg/kg/day (Ref. 82). No treatment-related effects were observed ator below 100 ppm in the diet in two chronic/oncogenicity studies in ratsand dogs for 2,6-dichloro-4-nitroaniline (DCNA), which does not inducesignificant methemoglobinemia in mammals (Ref. 83). An oncogenicity studyof DCNA in mice is in progress (Ref. 84).Because there is evidence from studies on the metabolism of methemoglobin-producinganilines for a non-genotoxic mechanism for the induction of hemangio- andfibrosarcomas in the spleen of rats from dietary exposure at high concentrations,and because EPA wants to review all relevant data on all the anilines beforemaking a determination as to the need for oncogenicity testing, the Agencyis deferring its decision on the need for additional data on oncogeniceffects of substituted anilines until the results of the in vivo mutagenicitytests are available (Ref. 85). The available data on the oncogenic effectsof aniline are adequate for TSCA risk assessment purposes.Also, after reviewing the available reports and studies on the acute andchronic health effects of the anilines category the Agency has found noevidence of adverse hematologic or central nervous system effects thatare not likely to be related to the decreased oxygen-carrying capacityof methemoglobic blood. The data provide no basis to believe that thesechemicals may present an unreasonable risk of adverse hematologic or centralnervous system effects at anticipated exposure levels as manufacturersand processors control potential human exposure below the threshold formethemoglobinemia. Therefore, the Agency has concluded that additionalinformation on hematologic or central nervous system effects of anilineand substituted anilines is not necessary at this time.4. <T3>Developmental toxicity. </T3>Aniline, a potent methemoglobin producer,was observed not to be developmentally toxic in rats at levels (100 mg/kg)that produced maternal and fetal toxicity commonly caused by methemoglobinemia(Ref. 86). Timed pregnant mice treated with aniline (500 mg/kg/day) duringdays 7 through 14 of gestation revealed no apparent effect on numbers oflitters produced; however, offspring viability through the first threepostpartum days was significantly lower than for the control group. Also,reductions in birth weight and weight gain were seen in aniline-treatedlitters (Ref. 87). No treatment-related maternal or embryotoxicity wasobserved below 125 mg/kg/day (oral administration) of 4-nitroaniline inNew Zealand rabbits (Ref. 88). 4-Nitroaniline administered by gastric intubationto pregnant rats at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day from day 6 to 19 of gestationwas not maternally or developmentally toxic (Ref. 89). At 85 mg/kg/daysome maternal toxicity (increased spleen weight) and fetotoxicity (reducedfetal weight) were evident; however, no developmentally toxic effects wereobserved. At 250 mg/kg/day, 4-nitroaniline produced maternal toxicity,embryotoxicity and terata. No treatment-related maternal or developmentaltoxicity was observed at or below 300 mg/kg/day of 2-nitroaniline to pregnantrats after gavage administration on days 6 to 15 of gestation. Significantevidence of maternal toxicity was observed at 2-nitroaniline dosages of600 mg/kg with a single malformation in one fetus each from two littersat that dosage (Ref. 90). Pregnant rats exposed to 1.1 and 1.7 mg/m\3\of 2,4-dinitroaniline developed maternal and embryotoxicity, but no otherdevelopmental toxic effects were observed (Ref. 91). Pregnant rabbits exposedto DCNA showed no maternal toxicity or developmental toxicity at 1,000ppm in diet (Ref. 92). A second teratology study of DCNA in rats is inprogress (Ref. 84).The data provide no basis to believe that these chemicals may present anunreasonable risk of adverse developmental effects at anticipated exposurelevels, as available data show no developmental effects that occur at exposurelevels at which some category members cause methemoglobinemia and manufacturersand processors control potential human exposure below the threshold formethemoglobinemia. Therefore, the Agency has concluded that additionalinformation on the developmental effects of aniline and the substitutedanilines is not necessary for risk assessment purposes at this time.5. <T3>Reproductive effects. </T3>Aniline administered subcutaneously in femalerats (average weight 150 grams) for seven days at 50 mg/day caused alterationsin steroidal hormone levels of the <T3>corpora luteum </T3>(Ref. 93). 4-Nitroaniline administered by gastricintubation at dose levels of 0.25, 1.5 and 9.0 mg/kg/day to the F0 andF1 generation of male and female rats during pre-mating growth and throughensuing mating, gestation, and lactation intervals showed no significantadverse effect on mortality rates or body weights in the F0 and F1 generations(Ref. 94). In the F0 generation, the male fertility index and pregnancyrate for the high dose group were lower than control data; however, onlyfor the pregnancy rate was this difference from the control group statisticallysignificant. In the F1 generation, mating, pregnancy, and fertility indiceswere comparable between control and treated groups. No adverse effectsof treatment were indicated during either generation in parturition orlitter size data, pup weight date, pup survival, or sex distribution dataor dead pup observations. Likewise, gross and histopathological evaluationof selected tissues from F1 and F2 pups or adults to include testes/epididymidesof F0 males (high dose group) did not reveal an adverse effect. The recentchronic study using aniline has no mention of long-term effects on reproductiveorgans (Ref. 69). Chronic studies on 4-chloroaniline and 4-nitroanilinehave no mention of effects on reproductive organs (Ref. 70 and 74). 4-Chloro-3-nitroanilinecaused testicular effects in rats after subchronic oral exposure at 90mg/kg/day, but the animals showed other toxicities as well (Ref. 82). TheNOEL was reported as close to but below 3.6 mg/kg/day. The 3.6 mg/kg/daydose produced a minimal toxic response. A sperm morphology vaginal cytology(SMVCE) study of 4-nitroaniline reported no effects of the chemical onmouse estrous cycles but reduced sperm motility in mice at 100 mg/kg/day(Ref. 95). An SMVCE study of 4-chloro-2-nitroaniline reported no effectson reproductive parameters in male rats; however, the chemical appearedto interfere with the relative frequency of estrous stages (600 and 1,200mg/kg/day) (Ref. 96). This effect is likely to be caused by alterationin hormonal activity. A three generation reproductive study of DCNA reportedno effects on reproductive parameters in male or female rats at 100 ppmand 10 ppm in diet (Ref. 97).The data provide no basis to believe that these chemicals may present anunreasonable risk of adverse reproductive effects at anticipated exposurelevels, as available reproductive effects data show no reproductive effectsthat occur at exposure levels at which some category members cause methemoglobinemiaand manufacturers and processors control potential human exposure belowthe threshold for methemoglobinemia. Therefore, the Agency has concludedthat additional information on the reproductive effects of aniline andthe substituted anilines is not necessary for risk assessment purposesat this time.6. <T3>Mutagenic effects.</T3> The following data were considered by EPA forevaluating the risk of mutagenic injury to human health from exposure toseven category members.a. Aniline is reported to have negative results in the following gene mutationassays: <T3>Salmonella, E. coli,</T3> WP2 uvr A, and <T3>Aspergillus</T3> (Refs. 98 through 101). Aniline is positive for theL5178Y TK, andplusmin; mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay and negative forthe <T3>Drosophila</T3> sex linked recessive lethal assay (SLRL) (Refs. 102through 104). Aniline is negative for sister chromatid exchange in humanlymphocytes, and negative for chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinesehamster ovary cells (Refs. 105 and 106). Aniline caused an increased frequencyof sister chromatid exchange (SCE) <T3>in vivo</T3> in mouse bone marrow cells and <T3>in vitro</T3> with Chinese hamster ovary cells (Refs. 107 and 108).Aniline also caused a slight increase in frequency of SCE's in culturedhuman fibroblasts (Ref. 109). EPA believes that an <T3>in vivo</T3> cytogenetics test is necessary for risk assessment purposes,and manufacturers have agreed to perform the testing (mouse micronucleus).b. 2-Chloroaniline is negative in the <T3>Salmonella</T3> gene mutation assay, and there are no data on cytogeneticeffects of 2-chloroaniline (Ref. 110). EPA believes that an <T3>in vivo</T3> cytogenetics test is necessary for risk assessment purposes,and manufacturers have agreed to perform the testing (mouse micronucleus).c. 4-Chloroaniline is reported to have positive results in the followinggene mutation assays; <T3>Salmonella, E. coli</T3> pol A, <T3>Aspergillis</T3> and L5178Y TKIandplusmin; mouse lymphoma (Refs. 101and 111 through 113). 4-Chloroaniline is positive for sister chromatidexchange and chromosomal aberration effects <T3>in vitro</T3> (Ref. 114). EPA believes that an <T3>in vivo</T3> cytogenetics test is necessary for risk assessment purposes,and manufacturers have agreed to perform the testing (mouse micronucleus).d. 3,4-Dichloroaniline is reported to have negative results in the <T3>Salmonella</T3> gene mutation assay and positive results in the <T3>Aspergillus</T3> gene mutation assay (Refs. 99 and 115). There areno data on the cytogenetic effects of 3,4-dichloroaniline. EPA believesthat an <T3>in vivo</T3> cytogenetics test is necessary for risk assessment purposes,and manufacturers have agreed to perform the testing (mouse micronucleus).e. 2-Nitroaniline is reported to have positive results in the <T3>Salmonella</T3> gene mutation assay; there are no data available onthe cytogenetic effects of 2-nitroaniline (Ref. 116 and 118). EPA believesthat an <T3>in vivo</T3> cytogenetics test is necessary for risk assessment purposes,and manufacturers have agreed to perform the testing (mouse micronucleus).f. 4-Nitroaniline is reported to have positive results in the <T3>Salmonella</T3> and L5178Y TKandplusmin; mouse lymphoma assays and negativeresults in the <T3>Drosophila</T3> SLRL assay (Refs. 117, 119 and 122). 4-Nitroanilineis weakly positive for sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberrationeffects <T3>in vitro</T3> (Ref. 120). EPA believes that an <T3>in vivo</T3> cytogenetics test is necessary for risk assessment purposes,and manufacturers have agreed to perform the testing (mouse micronucleus).g. 2,4-Dinitroaniline is reported to have positive effects in the <T3>Salmonella</T3> gene mutation assay and is negative in the <T3>Drosophila</T3> SLRL assay (Refs. 116, 121, and 123). 2,4-Dinitroanilineis also being tested for <T3>in vitro</T3> cytogenetics effects (Ref. 120). EPA believes that an<T3>in vivo</T3> cytogenetics test is necessary for risk assessment purposes,and manufacturers have agreed to perform the testing (mouse micronucleus).<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
