(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis W.Alvarez, a brilliant and wide-ranging scientist who helped developthe atomic bomb and a theory that asteroids wiped out thedinosaurs, has died at the age of 77.   Alvarez, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1968 forhis development of the liquid-hydrogen bubble chamber and for thenumerous elementary particles his team discovered using the device,died late Wednesday at his Berkeley home.   Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory spokeswoman Mary Barberia quotedAlvarez's wife, Janet, as saying her husband's health had declinedsince he underwent surgery for a benign brain tumor last fall, andthat he died from complications of a series of operations to treatcancer of the esophagus.   Alvarez, who did much of his research at Lawrence BerkeleyLaboratory but also was on the University of California at Berkeleyfaculty, was noted not only for physics, but for his work in thefields of archaeology, paleontology and astronomy   During World War II, he was credited with inventing a number ofradar systems and an effective bomb sight. He also played asignificant role in developing the atomic bomb during the ManhattanProject, invented several types of atom smashers and did a personalanalysis of evidence in the 1963 assassination of President John F.Kennedy.   But in the last decade, he was catapulted into headlines by thedinosaur extinction theory he developed with his son, Berkeleygeologist Walter S. Alvarez, and Lawrence Berkeley chemists FrankAsaro and Helen Michel.   They argued that asteroids or comets struck the Earth 65 millionyears ago, kicking up dust and smoke that blocked enough sunlightto sharply lower surface temperatures, destroying food plants tospur mass extinction of dinosaurs and many other species.   The theory triggered rancorous debate that continues today andrelates to a theory that nuclear warfare would create enough smoketo plunge Earth into a cold, dark ``nuclear winter'' that wouldwipe out survivors of the nuclear exchange.   While geologists and astronomers tend to support the dinosaurextinction theory, biologists and fossil experts usually argue thatgradual climate change caused the mass extinction. Others arguehuge volcanic eruptions were responsible, or that asteroids causedthe mass extinction not by blocking sunlight but by triggeringintense acid rain or extreme global warming.   University of California President David P. Gardner said he was``personally saddened, as is the entire University of Californiacommunity, by the death of Professor Alvarez.''   ``A creative and energetic scientist, he not only broughtrecognition and honor to the university by receiving a Nobel prize,but he also personally embodied the best of those qualities thatdefined his chosen profession _ concern for the student, commitmentto meaningful and distinctive research, and devotion to thebetterment of society,'' Gardner said. `He will be missed.''   Alvarez, born in San Francisco, was the son of Walter C.Alvarez, a noted physician and medical columnist at Minnesota'sMayo Clinic.   As an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, Alvarez builtone of the first Geiger counters in the United States, which heused as a graduate student to discover the East-West effect incosmic rays and prove that radiation from space consists mostly ofprotons.   In 1936, he began his work in Berkeley. Among his discoverieswere electron capture by nuclei, the radioactivity of tritium andthe magnetic moment of the neutron.   He gained public notice for several applications of physics topopular subjects. He X-rayed an Egyptian pyramid in search ofhidden chambers, only to find there were none. He developedevidence regarding the assassination of President Kennedy whichsupported the findings of the Warren Commission that Lee HarveyOswald was the lone assassin.   In addition to his wife, Alvarez is survived by two sons, twodaughters, two sisters and a brother.   Arrangements for a memorial service were pending.</TEXT></DOC>
