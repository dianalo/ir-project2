The identityof the trace quantities of low ionisation potential impurities responsiblefor the laser induced ionisation in conventional chamber gases has causedmuch discussion. Using two photon resonant ionisation spectroscopy twoof the major sources of ionisation in proportional counters have beenidentified as phenol and toluene.</TEXT></DOC>
