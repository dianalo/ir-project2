The justices, four of whom are over 70, threw out an appeal byeight current or former New York judges who say the retirementpolicy violates the Constitution's equal-protection guarantees.   The court cited the lack of a ``substantial federal question''in dismissing the appeal.   The New York policy, reflected in the state's constitution and astate law, was upheld by the New York Court of Appeals last Sept. 3.   The state's highest court ruled that the differing treatment ofelected and appointed judges is valid.   The state policy previously had applied to state and localjudges in New York, whether elected or appointed. A challenge to itwas rejected by the Supreme Court in 1985.   But the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, whichoriginally protected only people between 45 and 70 and does notapply to elected officials, was amended in 1987 to bar employmentdiscrimination against people over 70.   New York's policy subsequently was changed to exempt appointedjudges, sparking the equal-protection challenge.   ``That the state policy requiring retirement of judges ispartially frustrated because the federal statute preempts it withrespect to appointed judges does not render the policy irrational,and the state is free to pursue that policy to the extent doing sois consistent with federal law,'' the state court ruled.   The state court used the least stringent standard of review forequal-protection challenges, in which courts decide whether a lawor governmental policy that allows differing treatment is rational.   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the five state judgesargued that differing treatment based on age should spark the samestringent standard of review in courts as does differing treatmentbased on race.   The state Court of Appeals rejected that argument.   The eight judges who challenged the state policy are: BenjaminGlass, an elected state trial judge in New York City forced toretire in 1981; Benjamin Nolan and Louis Grossman, elected New YorkCity Civil Court judges; Barbara Kaiser and Ralph Diamond, electedstate Family Court judges in Westchester and Nassau Counties,respectively, who turned 70 last year; Samuel Greenstein, anelected New York City Civil Court judge who is 65; and James P.Griffin and H. Buswell Roberts, whose judicial positions were notlisted in submitted court documents.   Federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, are appointedfor life. The four justices over 70 are William J. Brennan,Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and Byron R. White.   The case is Diamond vs. Cuomo, 87-1361.</TEXT></DOC>
