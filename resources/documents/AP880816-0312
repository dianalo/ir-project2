Combined sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks totaled277,952 for the nine selling days from Aug. 1-10, up from 264,588in the comparable period last year, the automakers reported. Therewere only eight selling days in the 1987 period, and on a dailybasis, sales were down 6.6 percent.   Sales reached a 7.6 million seasonally adjusted annual rate, thesame as in the preceding 10-day period, from July 21-31.   In early August 1987, buyer incentives aimed at clearing excesscars from crowded dealer lots pushed the annualized sales rateduring the period to 8.4 million, compared with the year-long 1987rate of 7.1 million.   This year, the Big Three automakers' inventories are hoveringaround a 60-day supply of vehicles, which the companies considerideal, and the fire-sale atmosphere is gone, said analyst JosephPhillippi at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.   Sales are relatively strong, Phillippi said, although comparedto last August, ``They are going to be rather lackluster because weare comparing against an incentive period.''   ``Consumer confidence is high, gasoline is cheap, it's a boomysituation,'' said Drexel Burnham's Healy.   General Motors Corp. sold 86,676 cars from Aug. 1-10, down from91,582 in the early-August 1987 period that was boosted by acut-rate financing program, GM spokesman Karen Longridge said.Daily sales were down 15.9 percent from the year-earlier period.   Ford Motor Co. sold 52,239 cars, up from 49,402 a year earlierbut down 6 percent on a daily basis.   Chrysler Corp. sold 24,167 cars, up from 17,568 a year earlier,a 22.3 percent jump in daily sales.   August 1987 sales were slowed by dealer shortages of compactOmni and Horizon models after a plant conversion shutdown, Chryslerspokesman Tom Houston said.   GM sold 44,650 light trucks, up from 41,959 in the year-agoperiod but down 5.4 percent in daily sales. Ford's sales of 33,943light trucks were down from 34,414, a daily sales decline of 12.3percent. Chrysler light truck sales of 19,156 topped 16,621 a yearearlier, a 2.4 percent increase.   Honda Motor Co. Ltd. sold 9,531 U.S.-built cars, up from 8,421 ayear earlier and up 0.6 percent in daily sales.
