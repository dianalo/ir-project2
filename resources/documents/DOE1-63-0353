This market has traditionally beensupplied with normalized plate. This paper presents data on the developmentof controlled rolled, low carbon - Mn-Cr-Ni-Nb-V-Ti strand cast steelfor this application. In addition to plate strength and Charpy toughnessdata, results are presented on the steel's lamellar tearing and heataffected zone cold cracking resistance, and submerged arc weld heat affectedzone fracture toughness. 32 refs., 31 figs., 12 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
