Their behavior is an embarrassment to the U.S. and voters need someone to hold accountable.    Nicaragua's Sandinistas are breaking all the promises they made to Mr. Wright in exchange for his scuttling of U.S. support for anti-Marxist forces in that stricken country. Various figures in the U.S. Senate and House last week stood up and beat their breasts in protest. Then both bodies passed resolutions saying that what the lads in Managua were doing isn't nice.    It is even worse than not nice. Tomas Borge's thugs spent last week clubbing people for expressing their annoyance with food shortages, raging inflation and the loss of political freedom. The U.S. ambassador was falsely blamed for stirring up passions and was expelled. The opposition press was silenced once more and leaders of a huge anti-government rally arrested.    This week, the Sandinista junta moved further toward Stalinism with &quot;unilateral sentencing,&quot; handing some three dozen demonstrators six-month sentences -- without trial.    Somewhere in America there still may be revolutionary romantics who get a little tingle when they hear of such tactics. But for the dominant left of the party convened in Atlanta, Nicaragua simply doesn't matter. Let the thugs win; the only important thing is that America doesn't soil its hands. The people of Nicaragua take a different view. They know that this Marxist takeover, now eight years old, will continue to tighten its grip, supported by the weapons and police state tactics that have worked to such good advantage for Communist governments in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and Cuba.    Latinos and others unfamiliar with U.S. politics might think that Speaker Wright is a ninny, unschooled in the ways of hard-headed Marxist politicians. They underestimate the man. Mr. Wright interceded in Central America not out of naivete but because the left wing of his party demanded that he help counter President Reagan's hard line. Intervention was, some say, a condition for winning left-wing support to become the powerful man he is now.    Thus, Mr. Wright is able to stand before the Democratic convention this week as a leader who has paid his dues to most of the party's factions. Since most Americans aren't keen about involvement in Central America, the price for appeasing the left wasn't very high. It is high only for Nicaraguans nursing head wounds and languishing in jail cells this week. And they don't vote. </TEXT></DOC>
