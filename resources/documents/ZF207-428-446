(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>WANs: Long-distance informationandM;After many &quot;Year of the LAN&quot; promotions, LAN manufacturers have turned theirmarketing focus toward wide-area networks (WANs), also known as corporate orenterprise networks.andP;  This broader aspect of networking and datacommunications has gained in popularity as both business and academicorganizations strive to achieve higher levels of connectivity betweengeographically dispersed computer systems.andM;Traditional microcomputer LANs served both single-user and departmentalapplications, usually linking five to 15 people to a file and/or printserver.andP;  In most cases, the needs of a department were addressed within theconstraints of these localized configurations.andM;However, in an effort to leverage their large investment in microcomputers,LANs and departmental solutions, many organizations have recently initiatedstrategic planning efforts directed at corporatewide connectivity.andP;  As such,information systems telecommunications managers are energetically pursuingcorporate mandates for enterprise connectivity and interoperability, hopingto add systemwide features like electronic mail, distributed databases anddirectory services Large, potentially unmanageable multivendor WANs are thepossible outcome of such efforts.andM;To many telecommunications purists, the term &quot;wide-area network&quot; usuallyrefers to point-to-point links between two or more sites.andP;  Often these linksuse synchronous or asynchronous telecommunications protocols over a varietyof available transport media.andP;  These transport systems may includevoice-grade dial-up lines, data-grade leased lines or microwave, radio,infrared or satellite links.andM;When used with the various WAN technologies, LAN bridges and routers allowyou to logically extend a LAN over a wide-area link while retaining many ofthe features of a local network.andP;  Atypical WANs can also be created usingother technologies, such as fiber optics, which can greatly extend thedistance over which most LANs can operate.andP;  Although most conventionalcopper-wire LANs are limited to a few thousand feet of cabling, fiber-opticLANs allow extensions of three or more miles.andM;Enabling technology.andP;  From a Macintosh perspective, there are a number ofproducts that can be considered enabling technology for creating WANs.andP;  Manyof these products, like the InterBridge from Hayes Computer Products ofNorcross, Ga., have been available for a number of years.andP;  Only recently,however, have applications such as E-mail been designed to work with large,multisite Macintosh networks.andP;  The primary function of the products in thisniche is joining geographically dispersed LocalTalk networks to form onelarge logical AppleTalk network.andM;Hayes' InterBridge, San Diego-based Solana Electronics' R-Server, Cambridge,Mass.-based Shiva Corp.'s TeleBridge and Portland, Ore.-based Infosphere'sLiaison are some of the products that are available for creating AppleTalkWANs.andP;  WANs for larger buildings or campuses often use baseband Ethernet orbroadband backbones to link multiple floors and/or buildings within a commonarea.andP;  Products designed to connect LocalTalk networks to Ethernet orbroadband networks include Walnut Creek, Calif.-based Kinetics' FastPath 4,Cambridge, Mass.-based Cayman Systems' GatorBox and Carrollton, Texas-basedCactus Computer's BroadTalk-to-LocalTalk gateway.andP;  Liaison can also be usedto bridge these environments.andM;Ethernet networks can, in turn, be bridged between locations, therebycreating a substantially larger logical network throughout an organization.andO;Many products for bridging remote Ethernets are available from manufacturerslike Digital Equipment Corp., VitaLink of Fremont, Calif., and Santa Clara,Calif.-based 3Com's Bridge division.andM;Depending on your needs, a variety of products can be combined to suit yourapplications.andP;  Generally, WANs can be organized by their geographic domainand the type of technology employed.andP;  For purposes of this article, WANs aredivided into transient, or dedicated, building and campus networks.andM;Transient WANs.andP;  Asynchronous WANs are often used to create transient linksbetween remote LocalTalk networks or to allow stand-alone Macintoshes toconnect to a network.andP;  These solutions, although sometimes painfully slow,allow for network-based services to be extended at relatively low cost.andM;For less than $2,000 plus phone costs, you can install a low-speed (2,400bits per second) asynchronous bridge between two LocalTalk networks.andP;  Theselow-speed connections are suitable mainly for exchanging E-mail, transferringsmall files and performing some network administration and support functions.andO;With the increasing availability and declining cost of 9,600-bps modems, youcan buy a high-performance bridge for $4,000 to $4,500.andM;In addition to allowing you to transfer larger files, these higher-speedlinks may let you access a remote database, depending on the design of thedatabase (for example, if it follows the client-server model).andM;For Gary Thompson of Thompson and Thompson, a graphics and printing servicebureau in Chicago, &quot;The only way to go in terms of our applications is 9.6[Kbps].andM;&quot;Our clients and customers often send large files, and 2,400 [bps] isprohibitively slow,&quot; he said.andM;Thompson uses Liaison, which allows customers to dial into his network andsend files to his company's Linotype imagesetters.andP;  Liaison differs fromother products in this group in that it is a software, rather than ahardware, solution.andP;  Liaison essentially allows a Macintosh to function as abridge between LocalTalk networks, LocalTalk and EtherTalk networks, orLocalTalk and asynchronous networks.andP;  Configured under the Chooser and ableto work in the background, Liaison offers bridging functionality without theexpense of a dedicated hardware bridge.andM;Gloria Witek, director of a large Macintosh network at EncyclopediaBritannica in Chicago, said that she tried both Solana's R-Server and Shiva'sNetSerial but was unhappy with the performance of both.andP;  Infosphere, on theother hand, &quot;has been very responsive, often getting us products the sameday,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;We have not had any noticeable problems with Liaison todate and are planning to expand its use wherever necessary.&quot;andM;Dorothy Mulligan, coordinator for academic computing and educationaltechnology at Jersey City State College in New Jersey, manages the college'smicrocomputer networks.andP;  She has been able to offer a wide variety ofservices to both students and faculty who dial in to their campuswidenetwork.andP;  She currently uses Solana's R-Server and Hayes' V-Series 9600 V.29modems.andP;  She said she prefers the Solana R-Server to other dial-inconfigurations, such as the Hayes InterBridge, because it offers a morerobust solution.andP;  &quot;I have heard of others who have had problems using theInterBridge at 9,600 bps, and we definitely needed as much bandwidth aspossible,&quot; she said.andM;Rob Kinnen, office technology coordinator at Arthur Young Co.'s New Yorkoffice, is testing Shiva's new TeleBridge.andP;  &quot;We have had some problems usingthe InterBridge at 9,600 bps, even using their own V-Series 9600 modems,&quot; hesaid.andM;Building WANs.andP;  WANs, of course, are not limited to networking multipleremote locations but can also include communications between differentlocations within the same large building.andP;  Such systems are often referred toas vertical networks, in contrast with the horizontal networks used to linkpeople on the same floor.andM;Vertical networks or building backbones are a common means of tying multipleLANs within one building into one larger LAN, or building WAN.andP;  Berkeley,Calif.-based Farallon's StarController has popularized the installation ofsuch vertical networks in the LocalTalk world.andP;  StarControllers dramaticallyextend the range of an AppleTalk network.andP;  They not only combine multiple3,000-foot PhoneNET segments into one large network, but they also retain thelow cost of a PhoneNET network.andM;Jeffrey L. Albert, a graphics editor for USA Today, was able to create amultifloor network using existing building wiring at the newspaper'sArlington, Va., headquarters.andP;  Albert also relies on Hayes InterBridges to&quot;segregate network traffic on a departmental basis to ensure adequateperformance of a multi-user Omnis 3+ database.andP;  TOPS file services and theirlarge printing requirements,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The bridges ensure that heavynetwork traffic within one department does not affect the entire network.andO;Yet for other tasks where we need to share information or services throughoutthe network, it appears to the users as one logical system.&quot;andM;Campus WANs.andP;  Campus LANS and WANs are a step beyond single-building WANs.andO;They are popular at many universities and multibuilding company complexeswhere an organization has right-of-way in electrical conduits orline-of-sight between the buildings comprising the &quot;campus.&quot;andP;  Lately, localBell operating companies have also stepped into this market by offering acentral office LAN (CO-LAN).andM;The CO-LAN, which can be installed for about $800 per connection and isavailable through the regional Bell telephone companies, provides a means bywhich locations can be linked at speeds of 19.2 Kbps using dataover-voicemultiplexers and telephone central office digital switches.andP;  Thislittle-known product offers good performance at low cost.andM;Like the subnets that they link, common campuswide networks rely on anEthernet or broadband network to link many installations on a campus.andP;  Mostcampuswide networks are used to link mainframes, minis and microcomputersthroughout the complex.andP;  Often, the main reason for having a backbone is toallow access to larger computers in a computing center to be distributed toterminals and workstations throughout the campus.andP;  Macintosh users in such anenvironment experience the added benefit of being able to share files andapplications across the network since they are essentially on the samelogical network.andM;In most campus WAN scenarios, multivendor integration strategies focus onproviding interoperability among computing environments.andP;  The Cayman GatorBoxexcels in such instances by providing not only a LocalTalk-to-Ethernetgateway but also application gateway support for network file system (NFS).andM;One of the benefits of NFS support when used with the Cayman GatorBox is thatthe Unix file system is translated into AppleTalk Filing Protocol (AFP)servers, which appear to a Macintosh user as an AppleShare file server.andP;  Forexample, a file subdirectory on a Sun workstation that is attached to anEthernet network would appear on your desktop as if it were an AppleShareserver.andM;&quot;We chose the GatorBox because we wanted an integrated solution and requiredNFS support, something Kinetics does not yet offer,&quot; said Mark Ryding, aprogrammer/analyst at TRW in Ogden, Utah.andP;  TRW's large network is comprisedof almost 650 Ethernet nodes as well as more than 100 Macintoshes linkedtogether from four remote locations.andP;  &quot;We chose TCP (transmission controlprotocol) and NFS because they are the most common denominators among a widevariety of vendors,&quot; Ryding said.andM;Synchronous/leased-line WANs.andP;  In traditional WAN implementations, ahalf-bridge is located on the LAN to bridge or route LAN packets over theleased line to a similarly configured bridge at a remote location.andP;  Speedsfor these dedicated LAN bridges generally range from 9.6 to 64 Kbps.andP;  (Insome instances speeds of up to 10 Mbps can be reached using aggregate T-1,T-2 or T-3 circuits on links using microwave, infrared, laser or fiber-optictechnology.)andM;In most cases, however, the linking speeds are lower than the local LANtransport speed, creating the potential for bottlenecks that may limit thetypes of applications that can be used across the WAN link.andP;  For example,common microcomputer database applications are usually prohibitively slowover 9,600-bps WAN links.andP;  They are best-suited for providing electronic-mailinterchange, virtual terminal access, conduits for peer-to-peer orclient-server applications, and some file exchange.andM;&quot;Our WAN needs to encompass much more than connecting Macintoshes, and thuswe've chosen high-performance Ethernet bridges like the (Fremont,Calif.-based) TransLan VitaLink and 3Com's Bridge IB/3,&quot; said TRW's Ryding.andO;The cost of remote Ethernet bridges, of which there are many, is oftenprohibitive if the only application is to link Macs to an Ethertalk network.andO;It is more often the case in large corporate and academic institutions thatEthernet networks provide the backbone transport medium for the enterprisenetwork.andM;Adding Macintosh gateways to an already complex WAN can create additionalareas of concern.andP;  About the creation of zones, Jim Walters, director of theCenter for Instruction Technology at Maricopa Community College District inPhoenix, Ariz., said: &quot;I strongly encourage the development of network-namingstandards early in the implementation of any WAN.andP;  One problem we've had isthat Macintosh networks have been so easy to install that in some cases,installation preceded thorough planning and development of naming standards.&quot;andM;Others concurred with Walters, noting that problems can arise when networkchanges are made autonomously because of the ease of installing Mac WANs.andM;WAN administration.andP;  One of the larger issues in planning and implementing aWAN is network management and administration.andP;  Things can get out of handquickly when creating a large multivendor, multiprotocol network.andP;  Installinga backbone is one thing, but making it work efficiently takes carefulplanning, observation and administration.andP;  Although network administrationhas not been a problem, said Arthur Young's Kinnen, &quot;the network is almosttoo transparent.andM;&quot;I need ways of restricting access to WAN services on a user-by-user basis,and there is currently no easy way to do this,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Managing a data communications network is far more complex than managingtraditional telecommunications systems,&quot; wrote John Leong, director ofnetworking and communications at Carnegie-Mellon University, in the Marchissue of LAN Technology.andP;  &quot;You not only have to be well-acquainted with theins and outs of networking hardware, you also need to understandcommunications protocols, and sometimes even implementations and quirks ofthe software running in the workstation.&quot;andM;Macintosh WANs are becoming easier to install with each new product releaseand update.andP;  One bit of advice from those who have installed one is: Don'tget started installing a WAN of any magnitude unless you have a clearstrategy regarding what to do when it breaks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
