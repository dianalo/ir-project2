Really?</HEAD><NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE><BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a strange twist of logic, the United Statesis sometimes referred to these days as a debtor nation, attended byall the negative implications that go with such a categorization.   The popularity of the debtor thesis arises mainly fromstatistics that show the value of foreign-held assets in the UnitedStates now exceeds the value of U.S. assets held abroad.   The official figures verify the situation. In 1987, Americanswere said to own $1.1 trillion of foreign assets, whereasforeigners were credited with owning about $1.5 trillion worth ofthe United States.   But, say critics of such thinking, so what!   Before lamenting the passing of a great financial power, thecritics say, an application of reason might reveal that what issuggested as an American weakness may very well be strength instead.   Their contention is that foreigners should indeed be attractedto U.S. assets, since such assets are a solid investment providinga good return in the most politically stable large nation on earth.   In short: That foreign money isn't lent to desperate Americansso much as it is invested in attractive holdings. It isn't moneybegged to avert disaster; it is money attracted by good prospectsand rates of return.   At any rate, says William K. MacReynolds of the U.S. Chamber ofCommerce, the debtor nation idea does not ``comport with acceptednotions of what debtor status means.''   He points out, for example, that a common definition of a debtoris that of an entity having negative net worth, owing more inliabilities than is owned in assets. Profligate as he is, Uncle Samdoesn't fit the definition.   MacReynolds comments that all U.S. assets, including corporateequity and bonds, government obligations, real estate, bank assetsand more, amount to $30 trillion. Of that foreigners, owned but 5.6percent.   He offers still another method of looking at the so-calledburden: Compare it with a year's worth of income. By that test, hesays, one year's U.S. income is more than enough to buy out allforeign assets owners at once.   That eventuality, of course, is implausible. More realistically,only a small portion of U.S. income, measured by gross nationalproduct, is needed to satisfy foreign asset holders in the form ofan annual rate of return.   Remember, what is called debt is really investment. Andinvestors, foreign and domestic, expect only a certain annualpercentage _ a rate of return _ rather than the entire amount atonce.   Besides, says MacReynolds, who is director of financial andmonetary affairs for the Chamber, even if the popular but spuriousdefinition of debtor nation is used, the United States still mightcome out on top.   Officially, the United States held $1.1 trillion of foreignassets at the end of 1987, or considerably less than the estimated$1.5 trillion of U.S. assets held by foreigners.   But, says MacReynolds, something doesn't add up. He asks how itcould be that U.S. investors abroad should earn $6 billion morethan foreigners earned here.   His guess is that the total of foreign assets held by Americansis greatly undervalued. Rather than the reported $1.1 trillion, hesays, such assets should be valued at more than $1.5 trillion.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wed July 6</NOTE></DOC>
