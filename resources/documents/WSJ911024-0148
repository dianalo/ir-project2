Aman shortage means fewer opportunities for women to getmarried. An infertility epidemic is striking marriedprofessional women who postpone childbearing. No-faultdivorce turns women into paupers. These things must be truebecause studies prove them so, and no week goes by withoutsome more harrowing news about ambitious women brought downby work. But in fact, writes Susan Faludi, a Wall StreetJournal staff reporter who received a Pulitzer Prize lastyear for her story on the human costs of the Safewayleveraged buy-out, these are myths perpetrated to derailwomen in their quest for equality. &quot;Backlash: The UndeclaredWar Against American Women&quot; (Crown, 552 pages, $24) describeshow flawed statistics, media manipulation, hypocrisy,misogyny and female masochism combine to undermine women athome and in the work place. Here are some excerpts.   On what has happened to women since the 1970s: &quot;. . . thelast decade has seen a powerful counterassault on women'srights . . . an attempt to retract the handful of small andhard-won victories that the feminist movement did manage towin for women. . . . Identifying feminism as women's enemyonly furthers the ends of a backlash against women'sequality, simultaneously deflecting attention from thebacklash's central role and recruiting women to attack theirown cause. . . .</LP><TEXT>   The backlash is not a conspiracy, with a councildispatching agents from some central control room, nor arethe people who serve its ends often aware of their role . . .For the most part, its workings are encoded and internalized,diffuse and chameleonic. . . . Taken as a whole, however,these codes and cajolings, these whispers and threats andmyths, move overwhelmingly in one direction: they try to pushwomen back into their `acceptable' roles -- whether asDaddy's girl or fluttery romantic, active nester or passivelove object.&quot;   On feminism: &quot;Feminism remains a pretty simple concept,despite repeated . . . efforts to dress it up in greasepaintand turn its proponents into gargoyles. As Rebecca West wrotesardonically in 1913, `I myself have never been able to findout precisely what feminism is: I only know that people callme a feminist whenever I express sentiments thatdifferentiate me from a doormat.'&quot;   On wage inequity: In 1986, &quot;Women working full-time madeonly 64 cents to a man's dollar . . . exactly the same gapthat working women had faced in 1955.   On the role played by Clarence Thomas as chairman of theEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) ininvestigating hundreds of sex discrimination complaintsagainst Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.: &quot;Thomas maintained that all thepay, hiring, and promotional inequities in the Sears docketcould be easily explained by such factors as education and,curiously, commuting patterns. Thomas was, in fact, sooutspoken that the Sears lawyers at one point even consideredcalling him as their own witness.&quot;   On why we hear so much about how independence is makingwomen sick in head and womb: &quot;From the `man shortage' to `theinfertility epidemic' to `female burnout' to `toxic daycare,' these so-called female crises have had their originsnot in the actual conditions of women's lives but rather in aclosed system that starts and ends in the media, popularculture and advertising -- an endless feedback loop thatperpetuates and exaggerates its own false images ofwomanhood.&quot;   One major reason why decreasing numbers of men supportwomen's equality: The &quot;leading definition&quot; of masculinityaccording to the Yankelovich Monitor survey &quot;isn't being aleader, athlete, lothario, decision maker, or even just being`born male.' It is simply this: being a `good provider forhis family.' If establishing masculinity depends most of allon succeeding as the prime breadwinner, then it is hard toimagine a force more directly threatening to fragile Americanmanhood than the feminist drive for economic equality.&quot;   We've been there before: &quot;The '20s eroded a decade ofgrowth for female professionals; by 1930 there were fewerfemale doctors than in 1910. When the Depression hit, a newround of federal and state laws forced thousands out of thework force, and new federal wage codes institutionalizedlower pay rates for women.&quot;   On why abortion rights make so many men so hysterical: &quot;.. . the peculiarly fierce animosity that {anti-abortionactivist Randall} Terry and his followers brought to thebattle over women's reproductive freedom was fueled bypassions other than philosophy or science . . . As they lostfinancial strength at work and private authority at home,they saw women gaining in ground in the office, challengingtheir control of the family at home, and even taking theinitiative in the bedroom. . . . Sexual independence, notmurder, may have been the feminists' greater crime.&quot;   One interesting explanation for the dramatic rise inviolence against women: &quot;With more women in college and atwork now, {members of the U.S. Attorney General's Commissionon Pornography} reasoned in their report, women just havemore opportunities to be raped.&quot;   On a bright spot in the backlash: &quot;Paul Harris Storesswitched from women's career clothes to miniskirts andpromptly lost $5.6 million.&quot;   ---   Ms. Hoelterhoff is the Journal's book editor.</TEXT></DOC>
