This is fortunate, because the first temptation of the White House was to appoint an aggressive prosecutor. This doesn't look so likely now that Rudy Giuliani has had to dismiss charges against three insider-trading defendants. We have some better ideas for the job.    The proper role of the chairman of the SEC is to protect market efficiency under a stable system where people know what behavior is legitimate and what isn't. Guaranteeing this rule of law means tempering the hang-'em-high attitude of lawyers in the agency's enforcement division with inputs from SEC economists who understand how markets work. Left free to pursue prosecutorial theories of insider trading, the lawyers wreak havoc. They once tried to mandate a market of &quot;equal information,&quot; so that anyone who had more information than someone else in the market was indictable, whether the information came from research or other sources. There is still no practical definition of insider trading.    Mr. Giuliani was approached for the chairmanship, but he now has the monumental problem that Robert Freeman, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor refused to roll over and settle. He may be tempted to resort to some law-expanding claim that something they did is now a violation. This would undermine an already shaky rule of law in the area.    Aside from an overly litigious prosecutor, the other kind of person who would make a poor chairman would be a Business Roundtable securities lawyer. The takeover debate needs all the facts about the benefits of takeovers that SEC economists can provide. They have helped prove that the market for corporate control does help weed out inefficient managers. Not all takeovers work out equally well, but on average the share price of acquired firms has risen by some 30%. The economy doesn't need as SEC chairman any lawyer whose career has been drafting anti-takeover bills.    This is especially true now that some dangerous bills are wending their way through Congress. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) has a bill favored by &quot;corporate reformers&quot; that actually would entrench managers and increase the likelihood of insider trading by making the Williams Act disclosure rules even more onerous. Acquirers would rely even more on bankers and arbs if they had less time to make open-market purchases of stock before a tender offer.    We've mentioned three names for the chairmanship, Seventh Circuit Judge Frank Easterbrook, George Mason Law School Dean Henry Manne and SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest. We'll add two others. One is Richard Willard, the assistant attorney general for the civil division. Mr. Willard would prosecute wrongdoers, but as the lawyer responsible for pushing tort reform and defending the U.S. in court, he is sensitive to the need for efficient legal rules and black-line standards of right and wrong. Charles Cox, another SEC commissioner, also deserves a look. A former chief economist who has been on the commission since 1983, Mr. Cox has been pushing for a clear definition of insider trading.    The White House needs to remember that information drives efficiency, setting the price for stocks and sending investments where they do the most good. If this is understood, the next SEC chairman will be someone who will enforce the law while also protecting the free flow of information in the market. </TEXT></DOC>
