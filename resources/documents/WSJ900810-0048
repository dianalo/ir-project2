Alan Simpson is having a tough go of it as he defendsthe use of employer sanctions to discourage illegalimmigration.   Struggling to be heard above the buzz of a disapprovingcrowd, the Wyoming Republican finally snaps, &quot;I didn't haveto show up, you know.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Perhaps not. But for many Republican officials andcandidates, appearances at groups like the National Councilof La Raza, an Hispanic-oriented research and advocacy groupthat held its convention here last month, are becomingvirtually compulsory as the Republican Party tries to expandits base in the post-Cold War, post-Reagan era.   &quot;Republicans are losing the old dynamics -- anti-tax,defense, anti-communism, anti-abortion to some extent,&quot; saysRepublican analyst Kevin Phillips. &quot;I think they're lookingaround to see whether there's some new dynamics. Clearlythere's more flexibility {among Hispanic voters}, and anamenability to Republicans.&quot;   Leading the GOP charge has been President Bush. During his1988 presidential campaign he vowed to appoint the firstHispanic cabinet member -- then beat his own timetable byhelping get Lauro Cavazos named education secretary in thewaning months of the Reagan administration. Once in the OvalOffice himself, Mr. Bush not only reappointed Mr. Cavazos butnamed a second Hispanic to the cabinet, Interior SecretaryManuel Lujan.   The president also has appointed Hispanics to otherimportant posts such as surgeon general and to the federalbench, as well as to less visible positions on federal boardsand commissions. Overall, White House figures show, Mr. Bushhas appointed 19 Hispanic men and women to positionsrequiring Senate confirmation, and 84 of the 2,304 politicalappointees throughout the federal bureaucracy are Hispanic.   While those figures are still a small percentage of allappointments, many Hispanic leaders give Mr. Bush high marksfor effort, and for something equally important: access. Lastmonth, for example, he appeared at the National Council of LaRaza's convention, becoming the first sitting president to doso in the group's 22-year history. He has also made sure thatHispanic leaders are consulted when issues of special concernto them arise.   &quot;He's getting credit and he deserves credit,&quot; says RaulYzaguirre, leader of the National Council of La Raza. &quot;He'scertainly indicated he wants to be accessible to us.&quot;   In electoral terms, the GOP's courtship of Hispanic votersmight still seem a foolhardy quest. The national party hasbeen seriously trying to compete for the Hispanic vote sinceCalifornia-born President Richard Nixon first began organizedoutreach efforts. Yet according to ABC-TV's 1988 exit polls,Democrat Michael Dukakis won about 66% of the Hispanic vote,more than either Walter Mondale in 1984 (56%) or Jimmy Carterin 1980 (55%).   The Southwest Voter Research Institute, a San Antonio,Texas, research group that focuses on Hispanic issues,figures that about three out of four Hispanic voters stillidentify themselves as Democrats in every state but Florida,where fervently anti-Communist Cubans have been GOP stalwartsfor decades. Of more than 3,317 Hispanic elected officialssurveyed in 1987, 89% were Democrats and only 9% Republicans.   Moreover, of more than 20 million Hispanics in the U.S. in1988, about 13 million were old enough to vote, but onlyabout 4.6 million were registered, according to the CensusBureau. The low registration rate comes about in part becausenearly 40% of Hispanic adults aren't citizens and thus aren'teligible to vote.   But several other factors combine to convince GOPstrategists that they can't ignore the Hispanic bloc. For onething, Hispanic voters are concentrated in the 10 largest --and thus most strategically important -- states, includingCalifornia, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois, as wellas smaller but growing states like Colorado and New Mexico.Hispanic voters also have increased their politicalparticipation substantially in recent years. Voterregistration and turnout both rose nearly 20% between the1984 and 1988 elections.   Much of the increase is related to rapid growth in theHispanic population. But Andy Hernandez, who heads theSouthwest Voter Research Institute as well as a relatedvoter-registration project, also sees a substantial increasein Hispanic voters &quot;getting into the loop&quot; and deciding toparticipate in the political process.   What especially attracts Republican strategists is abelief that Hispanic voters are less firmly tied to onepolitical party and more willing to switch when the rightcandidate or issue presents itself. &quot;There's an elasticitythere that you don't have with the black vote,&quot; saysRepublican pollster Robert Teeter, a close associate ofPresident Bush.   Moreover, GOP strategists say, many Hispanic voters can belured by longstanding Republican positions on such issues aseconomic opportunity, defense and &quot;family values.&quot; Alsoappealing is the relative youth of the Hispanic population --the median age is only 26.1 years, compared with 27.7 forblacks and 33.6 for whites -- giving the GOP a chance to makeinroads with a population whose party loyalties haven't yettaken root.   The Republicans, says Mr. Hernandez, &quot;don't have to winall the Hispanic votesthey just have to cut margins. It'stheir opportunity to improve their competitiveness,&quot;especially on less-visible or &quot;downballot&quot; races.   In some cases, though, the Republicans have found theprocess of making inroads to be slow going. In Texas, forinstance, the voter institute's numbers show that 60% of theHispanics who voted for President Reagan shifted to Mr.Dukakis in the 1988 election. &quot;In 1988 we were beginning tounderstand that Hispanic poverty had increased,&quot; and manyvoters blamed Mr. Reagan's policies for that, says theNational Council of La Raza's Mr. Yzaguirre.   Adding to the problem was a political misstep that,observers say, made many Latinos feel unwelcome in the TexasGOP. In 1986, the Republicans had nominated a Hispanic forstate attorney general who, although narrowly losing therace, garnered more Hispanic votes than any Republicancandidate ever. The candidate had done well in part bypointedly campaigning in both Spanish and English. Just daysafter the election, though, the state party endorsed a moveto designate English as the official U.S. language. &quot;All thegood work got wiped out with that one act,&quot; says Mr.Hernandez.   &quot;Both parties are serious about Hispanic votes,&quot; he adds.&quot;The question is, are they going to take Hispanic votersseriously.&quot;   ---           Hispanics Appointed By President Bush                                                                                                          Appointments requiring Senate confirmation or Presidentialcommission                                                                                                          Asians ......................................   9                                                                                                          Blacks ......................................  50                                                                                                          Hispanics ...................................  19                                                                                                          Native Americans ............................   2                                                                                                          Whites ...................................... 604                                                                                                          Total Presidential Appointments ............. 684                                                                                                          Source: White House Office of Personnel</TEXT></DOC>
