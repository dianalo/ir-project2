Competition between Solidarity and the communist Polish UnitedWorkers Party for the support of the two smaller parties, whicheach side needs to form a coalition, has produced a governmentcrisis once unimaginable in postwar Poland.   In Italy, two visiting Solidarity leaders said reformistcommunists could be allowed in a Solidarity-led government,suggesting a possible way out of the impasse.   ``The only government that can appear credible in the eyes ofthe Polish people is an executive headed by Solidarity in coalitionwith all the reformist forces in the country,'' including communistreformers, Adam Michnik, one of Walesa's closest strategists, toldthe Italian television network RAI Thursday.   Solidarity parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek told RAI thatSolidarity felt forced by Poland's economic crisis _ especiallysharp increases in food prices Aug. 1 _ to accelerate its timetablefor entering into power.   Michnik and Geremek, who were in Italy to be received byPolish-born Pope John Paul II, said the key factor was forSolidarity to head the next government.   Aleksander Bentkowski, Peasant Party parliamentary leader, helda hastily called meeting in Waraw with newly elected communistPrime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, a government spokesman said. Thestate news agency PAP gave no details in a report on the meeting.   The Peasant Party ``took the decision to support Gen. Kiszczaktoo hastily and now our electors blame us for that,'' Bentkowskilater told PAP. He said that had to be relayed to Kiszczak and thePeasant Party leadership.   For his part, Kiszczak, the former interior minister, said hewas open to all proposals from the Peasant Party and declared hisreadiness for cooperation.   Communist party floor leader Marian Orzechowski told his caucushe had presented to Kiszczak the need for new faces in thegovernment, PAP reported.   Peasant Party deputies expressed opposition to Kiszczak during astormy caucus Wednesday night. The group took no official stand onthe future government at a meeting Thursday, and more debate isplanned next week.   A handful of Peasant Party lawmakers, led by Bentkowski,received leading Solidarity lawmakers Thursday at Peasant Partyheadquarters. Walesa delegated Sen. Jaroslaw Kaczynski of Elblag ashis envoy.   The closed meeting had been proposed as a preliminary exchangeof views on the possible shape of a Solidarity-Peasant coalition.   ``We're at the beginning of the beginning,'' Kaczynski saidbefore the meeting. He said afterward the talks would continue.   Kaczynski also met with Tadeusz Rymszewicz, a leader of theDemocratic Party, a smaller party that also has expressed interestin a non-communist coalition. PAP said they discussed Walesa'sproposal.   Although Kiszczak is trying to assemble a Cabinet to present tothe Sejm on Aug. 23 or Aug. 24, Solidarity parliamentary leaderBronislaw Geremek said his caucus would seek a coaltion with thePeasants and Democrats before then.   The Solidarity trade union has increased pressure on authoritiesby urging union members nationwide to plan ``protest actions''against government economic and political policies.   With Solidarity's 161 parliamentary seats and the Peasants' 76,a Solidarity-Peasant alliance would have a bare working majority of237 votes in the 460-member parliament, but they would have a firmmajority if joined by the 27-member Democratcs.   The possiblity of a non-communist coalition has promptedexpressions of alarm among communist authorities.   The Politburo said Tuesday such a coalition could threatenstability.   The communist coalition was guaranteed 65 percent of the Sejmseats and Solidarity allowed to contest only 35 percent under theagreement that set forth the conditions for Poland's freest vote in40 years in June.   But the communist party became a minority party in the Sejm forthe first time, holding only 173 seats and thus depending on itspreviously obedient allies for a majority. Solidarity won all 161of the seats it was allowed to contest.   Peasant and Democratic legislators used to owe their seats tocommunist-led nominating boards, but this time were elected incompetitive voting.   The communist alliance elected Kiszczak prime minister overSolidarity's objection Aug. 2, but now shows signs of crumblingafter Walesa proposed the Solidarity-Peasant-Democrat alliance.   The communist alliance is being strained by the negativereaction to Kiszczak's election and growing anger over sharplyincreasing food prices and the lack of consumer goods.</TEXT></DOC>
