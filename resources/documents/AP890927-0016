Just down the dirt road, bare-chested Kan Kun, one of thecountry's tens of thousands of village militiamen, showed off hisAK-47 automatic rifle and two magazines.   ``All the men who can, use a gun to fight Pol Pot,'' he said,referring to the shadowy figure believed to still lead the KhmerRouge guerrillas.   It was an ominous portent of Cambodia's future, these scenesthat reporters stumbled upon along the Tonle Sap lake innorthwestern Siem Reap province.   What Hanoi said were its last soldiers in Cambodia returned homeTuesday, 10 years and nine months after Vietnam invaded, ousted thefanatical Khmer Rouge and sparked a civil war.   Like the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Vietnam's purportedpullout likely will improve the international standing of theformer occupier but condemn the country it occupied to a new phaseof fighting.   Since peace talks again have failed, the Vietnamese-installedPhnom Penh government will now face guerrillas alone as theSoviet-installed government in Kabul has done since the Red Armywent home in February.   But Kabul still stands, despite widespread predictions of aquick collapse, and Phnom Penh's position is even stronger, saidmany diplomats, including a Soviet Embassy official and Ngo Dien,Vietnam's ambassador to Phnom Penh.   Unlike Kabul, Phnom Penh controls most of the country'sterritory, they said. The Afghan resistance can recruit from 6million refugees in Pakistan, while the Cambodian guerrillas havejust 300,000 in Thailand.   The Afghan guerrillas have much wider international backing, andsupport from the people within Afghanistan.   The Khmer Rouge, the largest Cambodia guerrilla group, is widelyhated and cannot survive without Chinese and Thai support _ andthat is wavering.   ``In the not too far away future, I don't think Thailand will goon supporting the Khmer rouge, and China also,'' Ngo Dien said.   The Communist Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of peoplein during its nearly four-year rule as it tried to turn the countryinto a primitive agrarian commune.   Just as in Afghanistan, superpowers continue supplying the meansto kill. Chinese shipments continue. So do Soviet arms to PhnomPenh, Soviet Ambassador Rashit Khamidouline said, although theywere not increased with Vietnam's pullout because ``we don't wantto escalate the war.''   The Khmer Rouge siege of Pailin, near its sanctuaries inThailand, has been compared with the Afghan guerrillas' siege ofJalalabad, near the Pakistan frontier. The Cambodian guerrillaattempt to create a ``liberated zone'' has intensified withVietnam's retreat, and is seen as a crucial test of whether purefirepower can resolve the war.   Most analysts say neither army can win in Cambodia.   The key then will be whether there can be talks between PhnomPenh's Premier Hun Sen and guerrilla leader Prince NorodomSihanouk, who heads the coalition joining his forces with the KhmerRouge and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front.   ``In the coming dry season ... the guerrillas will launchattacks to test the strength of the Phnom Penh government. Afterthat, both sides may become more flexible,'' said Khieu Kanharith,a prominent newspaper editor in the Cambodian capital.   If genuine, the Vietnamese pullout would weaken Phnom Penhmilitarily but perhaps more crucially, it would erode theguerrillas' international position.   The guerrillas call the troop movement a fake, but manydiplomats believe Vietnam has withdrawn at least the bulk of itsarmy. That weakens the key guerrilla charge: that Phnom Penh ismerely a Vietnamese puppet.   The guerrillas may also lose morale if they see they are nowonly killing fellow Cambodians.   Anticipating this, the guerrillas recently stepped up chargesthat Vietnam is controlling the country with 1.25 millionVietnamese settlers.   Phnom Penh wants a political settlement because otherwise mostnon-Communist countries will not end diplomatic and economicembargoes that have hurt impoverished Cambodia.   But it sees a good second option in hints that even without asettlement, a few countries like Australia and Thailand mayrecognize Phnom Penh after a general election expected early nextyear.   There are no signs of progress on breaking the central impassein talks: the future of the Khmer Rouge.   Hun Sen repeated Sunday that he will make no concessions on hisdemand that the Khmer Rouge army and political organization bedismantled. Sihanouk says the Khmer Rouge will continue fightingunless it is allowed into a transitional coalition government.   However, the claimed Vietnamese pullout will focus greaterattention on resolving this question. And more than ever, the KhmerRouge is being pressured by its two strongest backers, China andThailand.   For the first time since Vietnam's invasion, three Chineseofficials visited Cambodia for economic talks earlier this year, anindication Beijing is keeping its options open.   And at Pailin and elsewhere, the Thai army has halted artillerysupport for the Khmer Rouge and cleared out some of its militarybases and secretive civilian camps, officials said.   Hanoi hopes its pullout will end the Western economic blockadesthat have made Vietnam worse off than the country it occupied.   Its retreat from Cambodia coincides with declining Sovietinfluence in both countries and could begin a strategic realignmentfavoring the non-Communist world, diplomats say.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><TEXT>   EDITOR`S NOTE: Peter Eng is news editor in Bangkok, where he hasworked for the past five years, making a number of trips intoIndochina.</TEXT></DOC>
