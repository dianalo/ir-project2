It couldbe stated that this is basically the same type of information availabletoday. However, in the context of the Federal Register Guideline forExposure Assessment and the principles presently being applied in thefield, the above should only be used as the basis for a preliminary assessment.It is necessary to develop new and improved types of data bases to accuratelyascribe exposures.</TEXT></DOC>
