The asbestos-mining concern, based in Thetford Mines, Quebec, has placed advertisements in newspapers in Canada and the U.S. offering an undisclosed reward to individuals with information about &quot;the existence of insurance policies issued before Jan. 1, 1967, by Maryland Casualty Co.&quot; to the benefit of Asbestos Corp.    Richard Dufour, the lawyer who placed the advertisements on behalf of Asbestos Corp., said the search for the general-liability insurance contracts has been prompted by the thousands of lawsuits launched against Asbestos Corp. by victims of asbestosis and other lung ailments linked to inhalation of asbestos fibers.    &quot;We don't have the contracts because they were probably destroyed or were kept by the brokers,&quot; he said. &quot;The people who were in charge of these files in the 1960s aren't around.&quot;    He said that prior to the advent of asbestos-liability suits in the 1970s, companies didn't have reason to keep old insurance contracts. In the asbestos-related litigation, however, some courts have found that companies are responsible for illnesses caused by exposure to asbestos that may have begun decades before.    Insurance industry officials say that it isn't unusual for old contracts to have been lost or destroyed, especially prior to the age of asbestos product-liability cases, but they say the offer of a reward is rare.    A spokesman for Denver-based Manville Corp., which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since 1982 when it sought protection from asbestos-related health claims, said it had problems locating old insurance policies but has successfully proved coverage before the courts through use of other documentary evidence.    Mr. Dufour said that Asbestos Corp. has sought the policies from Maryland Casualty but hasn't had luck there. &quot;I think they are honest. They probably destroyed the documents after a certain time,&quot; he said.    Mr. Dufour is convinced the insurance contracts existed because a Maryland Casualty contract that covered the company from 1967 to 1971 refers by number to the previous policy. He said the information about the existence of the contract could come from former employees, insurance adjustors, or brokers.    The ads have been placed in newspapers here and in Toronto, as well as in Baltimore, where Maryland Casualty is based, and in St. Louis, the home of General Dynamics Corp., Asbestos Corp.'s former parent.    An official for Maryland Casualty, a unit of Houston-based American General Corp., wouldn't comment.    Mr. Dufour said that the advertisements have elicited some responses but he declined to comment further. </TEXT></DOC>
