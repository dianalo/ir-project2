Shielding personnel and electronics from this intensebremsstrahlung was an important concern during the accelerator designphase. A previous study, using the three-dimensional Monte Carlo electron-photontransport code ACCEPT, indicated the need for additional close-in shieldingand for relocation of some electronic control devices. New ACCEPT simulations,described here, include a more efficient version of the next-event-estimatorcalculation, a more realistic source distribution for the electrons,and recent design information for the diode and the top and bottom radiationshields.</TEXT></DOC>
