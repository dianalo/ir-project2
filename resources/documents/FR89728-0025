Changing environmental conditions, State and Federal regulations,and other factors affecting wildlife populations and habitats may warrantmodifications to ensure the continued compatibility of hunting with thepurposes for which the individual refuges involved were established and,to the extent practical, make refuge hunting programs consistent with Stateregulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before August 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Address comments to: Assistant Director_Refuges and Wildlife,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 18th and C Streets, NW., MS 670-ARLSQ,Washington, DC 20240.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Larry LaRochelle, Division ofRefuges, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 18th and C Streets, NW., MS 670-ARLSQ,Washington, DC 20240; Telephone (703) 358-2036.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>50 CFR Part 32 contains provisionsgoverning hunting on national wildlife refuges. Hunting is regulated onrefuges to (1) ensure compatibility with refuge purposes, (2) properlymanage the wildlife resource, (3) protect other refuge values, and (4)ensure refuge user safety. On many refuges, the Service policy of adoptingState hunting regulations is adequate in meeting these objectives. On otherrefuges, it is necessary to supplement State regulations with more restrictiveFederal regulations to ensure that the Service meets its management responsibilities,as outlined under the section entitled ``Conformance with Statutory andRegulatory Authorities.'' Refuge-specific hunting regulations may be issuedonly after a wildlife refuge is opened to migratory game bird, upland game,or big game hunting through publication in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> These regulations may list the wildlife speciesthat may be hunted, seasons, bag limits, methods of hunting, descriptionsof open areas, and other provisions. Prevouisly issued refuge-specificregulations for migratory game bird, upland game, and big game huntingare contained in 50 CFR 32.12, 32.22, and 32.32 respectively. Many of theproposed amendments to these sections are being promulgated to standardizeand clarify the existing language of these regulations.The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practicable,to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.It is, therefore, the purpose of this proposed rulemaking to seek publicinput regarding these proposed amendments. Accordingly, interested personsmay submit written comments to the Assistant Director, Refuges and Wildlife(address above) by the end of the comment period. All substantive commentswill be considered by the Department prior to issuance of a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities </ITAG>The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (NWRSAA) of 1966,as amended (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16U.S.C. 460k) govern the administration and public use of national wildliferefuges. Specifically, section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes theSecretary of the Interior to permit the use of any area within the RefugeSystem for any purpose, including but not limited to, hunting, fishingand public recreation, accommodations and access, when he determines thatsuch uses are compatible with the major purpose(s) for which the area wasestablished.The Refuge Recreation Act authorizes the Secretary to administer areaswithin the Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriate incidentalor secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable and not inconsistentwith the primary purpose(s) for which the areas were established. The RefugeRecreation Act also authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations to carryout the purposes of the Act. Hunting plans are developed for each refugeprior to opening it to hunting. In many cases, refuge-specific huntingregulations are included in the hunting plan to ensure the compatibilityof the hunting programs with the purposes for which the refuge was established.Initial compliance with the NWRSAA and Refuge Recreation Act is ensuredwhen hunting plans are developed, and the determinations required by theseacts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the lists of areas opento hunting in 50 CFR. Continued compliance is ensured by annual reviewof hunting programs and regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Effect</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires the preparation of regulatory impact analysesfor major rules. A major rule is one likely to result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; or a major increase in costs orprices for consumers, individual industries, government agencies or geographicregions. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) further requires the preparation of flexibility analysesfor rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmentaljurisdictions.The proposed amendments to the codified refuge-specific hunting regulationswould make relatively minor adjustments to existing hunting programs. Theregulations are not expected to have any gross economic effect and willnot cause an increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local governments, agencies, or geographic regions.The benefits accruing to the public are expected to exceed by a large marginthe costs of administering this rule. Accordingly, the Department of theInterior has determiend that this proposed rule is not a ``major rule''within the meaning of E.O. 12291 and would not have a significant economiceffect on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Service has received approval from the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for the information collection requirements of these regulationspursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These requirements are presently approved by OMB underandplusmin;1018-0014 Economic and Public Use Permits. These regulations imposeno new reporting or recordkeeping requirements that must be cleared byOMB.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations</ITAG>Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543)is ensured when hunting plans are developed, and the determinations requiredby these acts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the lists ofareas open to hunting in 50 CFR. Refuge-specific hunting regulations aresubject to a categorical exclusion from the NEPA process if they do notsignificantly alter the existing use of a particular national wildliferefuge. The changes proposed in this rulemaking would not substantiallyalter the existing uses of the refuges involved.
