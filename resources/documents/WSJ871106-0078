They had already completed their trick: sneaking across the Rio Grande past U.S. immigration authorities.    Border Patrol agents call it the annual &quot;masked invasion,&quot; and it continues -- along with untold other illegal border crossings -- despite the sweeping immigration-reform bill signed into law by President Reagan a year ago today.    U.S. borders are tighter now. The Immigration and Naturalization Service boasts of a 34% drop in apprehensions along the 2,000-mile boundary with Mexico in the past 12 months -- a sign, it says, that illegal entries are also on the decline. Job opportunities for illegals are waning: Most employers are asking would-be workers for proof of their legal status now that a federal law punishes bosses for hiring undocumented workers.    But the year-old law is clearly no panacea. Some employers addicted to cheap labor continue to accept bogus proof of legal residence. And economic inequities remain endemic in much of Latin America and the Caribbean, the source of much of the migration. &quot;We are not going to eliminate illegal immigration,&quot; says Doris Meissner, a former acting INS commissioner. &quot;The underlying forces are too strong. What you hope to do with employer sanctions is keep it under some reasonable amount of control.&quot;    The other major feature of the new law -- providing &quot;amnesty&quot; to longtime illegals who meet several qualifications -- has also produced mixed results. Nearly a million illegal residents have applied for amnesty under the legalization program, and the INS expects a million more applications before the program ends -- but that would be far short of the 3.9 million applications the INS was prepared to receive.    And the law contains ambiguities, still unresolved, concerning members of immigrant families who arrived in the U.S. at different times. Opponents of the law argue that certain provisions threaten to divide families. The INS refuses to set a uniform policy but says that on a case-by-case basis it will keep spouses together for &quot;compelling&quot; and &quot;humanitarian&quot; reasons.    On the enforcement side, INS agents complain that the law is too flabby. &quot;Amnesty was a slap in the face,&quot; says a Texas-based agent. &quot;We were chasing these guys. Now . . . it's 'let's legalize them.'&quot;    Thus far, four employers -- an El Cajon, Calif., water-bed maker, an Arlington, Va., hotel, a San Francisco restaurant and a Ventura, Calif., landscaper -- have been served with notices that the government intends to fine them for infractions. Two plan a defense that is likely to be widely used initially: that their employees were &quot;grandfathered,&quot; or hired before the law was signed last Nov. 6.    Experts expect some industries to find it increasingly difficult to abide by the new law as the pool of 18- to 24-year-old U.S. workers continues to shrink. The restaurant industry, long dependent on young, low-wage workers, has already felt the pinch. &quot;The labor pull is making this bill not as effective as its sponsors had hoped,&quot; says Thomas Muller, an economist who has written on immigration. &quot;As long as we have very few young people coming into the labor force . . . there is going to be a flow of illegals.&quot;    Special-interest groups continue to look for loopholes. In Los Angeles, dance-hall operators are trying to import dancers through a federal guest-worker program designed for farm laborers and others. Illegal Irish immigrants are lobbying for their own bills in Congress. &quot;Every immigrant group takes care of their own,&quot; says Sean Benson, an Irish activist from New York.    On the first anniversary of the nation's toughest immigration law, here is a look at how the law is affecting some of the people it touches most closely: U.S. employers, immigrant families and INS enforcement officers.    El Cholo   At some of the quaint El Cholo restaurants in the Los Angeles area, the hottest item isn't the salsa. It's a $100 &quot;finder's fee&quot; for coming up with an employee who stays with the company for at least six months.    &quot;We're a little short of staff, especially in the kitchen,&quot; says the general manager, Timothy Hart, as he sits in Restaurant Business Inc.'s homely but crowded flagship restaurant downtown. &quot;We used to be able to pick and choose in hiring, but we don't have the luxury anymore.&quot;    Inside the 60-year-old eatery, Angelenos are filling up on the corn tamales, enchiladas and bracing margaritas that have made this El Cholo a local institution. One of the city's busiest restaurants, it rings up more than $6 million in annual sales on an average per-table tab of just $11.    Tonight, like many other nights since the immigration law passed, workers are trying to quicken their pace. The staff has shrunk since some employees returned to Mexico because of the new law and their slots proved hard to fill. Mr. Hart says that he used to interview four or five people for every job and that he never had to advertise an opening. Now, he says, he is lucky to see one or two candidates for each opening, and he has put ads in the local paper and instituted the finder's fee.    The company has five other restaurants and a total staff of 485 people, including a number of immigrants from Mexico, El Salvador and Nicaragua. All the employees have produced documents for the restaurant or applied for amnesty, and no one has been fired. Jeanine Mauser, a 23-year-old hostess, discovered to her surprise that she isn't a native-born American. &quot;All my life I thought I was born in Missouri, but when I asked my mom for my birth certificate, she told me I was born in Mexico City,&quot; she says.    Ron Salisbury, who is the president of the chain founded by his Latina mother and Anglo father, says that the paper work generated by the law is a mild nuisance compared with the gradual drying up of labor. Like the rest of the nation's $197.5 billion food-services industry, El Cholo has found that it has a shrinking pool of young people from which to draw workers. Job listings targeted at University of Southern California students snared one hire. More telling is the amount of overtime El Cholo is paying -- as much as 20% of its total payroll, up from only a couple of percentage points in past years.    By restaurant standards, workers at the chain are already fairly well-paid. Experienced cooks at some of the company's restaurants earn $14 an hour. Waiters earn the minimum wage plus tips, and tips for skilled servers can range from $120 to $200 on a busy night.    The Teran Family   On a dark street corner in Houston, tiny Joaquina Teran waits for a ride home after finishing her second part-time shift of the day scrubbing clothing-store restrooms. She works seven days a week.    In the shadows, with her long, dark hair pulled back, the chisled Indian features of Mrs. Teran's face suggest a young woman. But she is 40 years old, and in the light, her eyes show the hardship she has faced since she forded the waist-high Rio Grande in 1981 to bring her infant daughter, Marlen, and her toddler son, Horacio, to the U.S. &quot;If I die, I die here,&quot; she had thought then, &quot;but they will live.&quot;    When Mrs. Teran came to the U.S., she left four sons behind in Mexico with relatives. But by the fall of 1982, she and her husband, Estevan, who had migrated back and forth from Mexico since the early 1970s, had saved enough money to reunite the entire family.    Now the Terans fear that they will be separated again. In 1982 Mr. Teran was working at a grocery store when he was injured in a fall, and he worries that he could be deemed a &quot;likely public charge.&quot; That would trigger denial of legal resident status under a provision of the new law intended to ease the burden of amnesty on governmental agencies.    Marlen and Horacio applied for legalization along with their parents; the four older sons did not, knowing that they didn't qualify because they had entered the country after Jan. 1, 1982 -- the cutoff for seeking amnesty. Last month, the INS ruled that children who entered the country after the cutoff wouldn't be deported if both parents qualified for amnesty. In September, the two young Teran children received temporary residency. The parents are still waiting.    The delay worries Mr. Teran, who sells packets of corn tortillas to neighbors, earning $80 to $150 in a good week. &quot;I can't leave these children here,&quot; he says. If the whole family doesn't qualify, &quot;we are all going to have to go back.&quot;    The Enforcers   Thirty years ago, when he joined the U.S. Border Patrol, James B. Turnage Jr. didn't know much about immigration or immigrants. He just knew that the patrol paid more than the St. Augustine, Fla., police department, where he was working.    But Mr. Turnage has learned a lot since then. Today, as INS district director in San Diego, Calif., he is responsible for a 500-member team that monitors two counties and the busiest stretch of the porous Mexican border. Last year, his agents inspected more than 62 million people, cars, business establishments and hiding places -- roughly equivalent to reviewing the entire population of West Germany.    The year-old immigration law &quot;has doubled our workload,&quot; Mr. Turnage figures. And the new tasks are demanding. Local agents are responsible for educating, inspecting and occasionally fining the district's 62,000 employers. So far, Mr. Turnage's agents and their Border Patrol counterparts have made &quot;educational visits&quot; to about 21,000 sites. In addition, the INS tries to stem the lucrative flow of narcotics, stolen vehicles and other contraband across the border.    &quot;The greatest satisfaction of all this is knowing we're finally doing something about a situation that's been out of control,&quot; says the bespectacled 52-year-old. &quot;We're not just trying to lose as slowly as possible anymore.&quot;    Mr. Turnage's workday begins at 7:15 a.m. now, and he shuttles to Washington, D.C., and takes work home on weekends far more often than before. He also spends less time with his wife, Vicki, his two silky terriers and his garden.    But he is passionate about the merits of the new law. &quot;Should the mightiest nation in the world balance its economy on the backs of illegal aliens?&quot; he asks. &quot;It won't work in the long run.&quot;    The whiplashing effect of providing enforcement one day and service the next is more frustrating to some front-line INS officers. In Houston, investigators accustomed to hunting smugglers and aborting fraudulent-document schemes complain that they are now &quot;high-priced errand boys,&quot; relegated to glad-handing employers and passing out handbooks on a new law that should be even tougher. Says Dennis Smith, an INS investigator and union officer, &quot;I would put my money in the stock market before I'd bet anybody actually pays a fine.&quot;    In San Antonio and Austin, Texas, recently, INS agents simultaneously swooped into six stores of the Taco Cabana restaurant chain for an early morning raid. They nabbed nearly two dozen workers and searched through the employer's personnel and payroll records. Along with their warrants, the agents carried an affidavit alleging that fraudulent documents were being sold in Mexico specifically to obtain jobs at Taco Cabana.    Patrick Thomas, the company's lawyer, denies that the chain had anything to do with such documents. But he concedes, &quot;There is a document problem, a horrendous document problem.&quot;    Taco Cabana expects to receive a notice of &quot;intent to fine&quot; from the INS. But back at INS headquarters in Washington, a spokesman won't confirm that. &quot;We are trying to ensure that the cases we do serve are very good cases,&quot; he says. &quot;An investigator may say, 'Let's go right now,' but cooler heads will prevail.&quot;    ---             Key Dates in the New Immigration Law   Nov. 6, 1986 -- President Reagan signed the ImmigrationReform and Control Act, which grants amnesty and provides foremployer sanctions for knowingly hiring an illegal immigrantafter this date.
