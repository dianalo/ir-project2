Initial demand didn't appear strong for the few new issues to appear. The European Investment Bank's 100 million European currency units ($118 million) of 8 3/8%, 10-year Eurobonds, priced at 101 1/2 and led by Banque Paribas Capital Markets, was quoted around its break-even level.    Nearly two weeks after the historic plunge began in equities, the Eurobond markets remain in a state of near shock. Syndication has been almost halted, and trading is concentrated in a narrow band of seasoned issues.    Barring a resumption of stability in financial markets generally, the events of the past few weeks probably will accelerate a Eurobond retrenchment that may have been inevitable anyway, many analysts say.    The stream of new issues probably will be slowed for the rest of the year and perhaps longer. Market-making in fixed-coupon bonds will be limited to the largest top-quality issues; the number of active issues probably will shrink as dealers are forced to pare bonds from trading lists to limit risk. With volume sharply lower on all fronts, more dealers may opt to cut losses by pulling out.    &quot;The markets and liquidity have been distorted by the tremendous flight to quality,&quot; Miles A. Slater, president of Salomon Brothers International, said. &quot;Until we have a better sense of the direction of the markets, spreads will remain wide, and there will be less activity in non-government bond markets.&quot;    Such changes were under way well before the equities crash. Through mid-October, issuance of all types of Eurobonds already was running about 18% behind the pace set last year, when issues totaled $179 billion. Demand for dollar-denominated fixed-rate, or straight, issues weakened as long ago as last spring, after volatility in U.S. Treasury bonds and the dollar prompted foreign investors to shun dollar issues.    Similarly, volume had been declining in seasoned issues, partly because large investors saw the newly deregulated government markets in Britain and West Germany offering better credit risks and liquidity.    In the wake of the stock crash, however, most Eurobond sectors have nearly closed to new issues, and underwriters predict they will reopen only gradually. </TEXT></DOC>
