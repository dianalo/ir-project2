(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A legislative committee has approved a billrequiring children's homes to report certain information to thestate, a move sparked by widespread publicity on alleged abuse at afundamentalist Christian boarding home.   The Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee approved themeasure Tuesday without substantive debate. Panel Chairman RobertHuggins said he would likely call the bill up for debate before thefull Senate next week.   ``It's the first time the Legislature has taken this bold a stepas far as regulation of these homes are concerned,'' he said. ``It'sbeen something that in the past has been so politically hot that noone would touch it.''   Sen. Jim Bean, chairman of the subcommittee that handled thebill, said the proposal would not infringe on religious rights ofchurch-operated schools.   The bill would require the homes to provide the state Departmentof Health with:   _ Names, guardians and nearest relatives of all residents.   _ Proof of inspections by a local fire department or the statefire marshal's office and the local health department.   _ A statement that medical records are maintained on each child.   The bill also would require the homes to file monthly reportswith the Department of Health and have on hand policies addressingdiscipline and parent-child communication.   Huggins said he would have preferred seeing the state Departmentof Public Welfare as the agency receiving the reports rather thanthe Department of Health.   He said he believed political fallout from the WelfareDepartment's raid on the Bethel Home for Children in Lucedale lastsummer might have led to the Department of Health being thedesignated agency.   On June 10, the Welfare Department took temporary custody of 72Bethel children based on allegations of abuse and neglect. Most ofthe children taken from the home were released to parents orguardians, but the state took custody of 17.   The Rev. Herman Fountain, a fundamentalist Baptist minister andfounder of the controversial Bethel Home, has vowed to ignore anylegislation that becomes state law. He claims the home is part ofhis church and is exempt from any kind of state regulation under theU.S. Constitution.</TEXT></DOC>
