MATTHEW'S PASSION' WAS MISSING THE FIRE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The &quot;St. Matthew's Passion&quot; ranks among the greatest musicalaccomplishments of all time. No work has better portrayed the high drama ofChrist's betrayal, judgment and execution.;    Using verbatim texts fromScripture with hymnlike chorale interpolations, it's as if Bach had set out towrite an opera within the confines of the meager forces available to himwithin a tradition-bound Leipzig church setting.;    Surprise theme;  Even so,he manages to render the self-sacrifice of the Messiah almost as vividly aslive theater. The central theme of the work is a surprise: not the colossaltragedy but the desperate realization that we let such injustices take place-- the Christian's haunting, eternal guilt trip.;    It's impossible toperform Bach today the way Bach did it. The &quot;Passion&quot; was part of a Sundayservice possibly six hours long. Today women are used instead of choirboys.And unfortunately a 3,000-seat hall such as Davies is too big for only threesingers to a choral part, as Bach intended.;    Conductor Rilling, best-knownas the veteran music director of the Oregon Bach Festival, opted for acompromise that leaned toward a traditional, rather than authentic,interpretation. He used modern instruments plus a harpsichord, oboes d'amoreand viola da gamba. He employed 80 people in his adult mixed chorus and justmore than 40 in the orchestra. Vocal ornamentation was meager.;    When tenorUwe Heilmann canceled on short notice, Rilling brought in two singers toreplace him: an exceptional falsetto Scot Weir, for the narrative, and RobertWoerle of Germany for the tenor arias.;    At Wednesday night's performance,Woerle was still working his way into the role -- unfortunately from thefortissimo end.;    Absent eloquence;  The performance was, I think,deplorable. Rilling opted for reverence at the expense of drama and musicaleloquence. Rendering the entire score by heart, he played down all theinherent contrasts and accents.;    Mashed-potatoes enunciation masked thefact that this was a formidable chorus of soloists as dazzling in their doublefugues as in their true, powerful tone. Most of the night's soloists, in fact,were drawn from the chorus. When a bass such as Richard Haile emerges to singa couple of lines from the High Priest with an earth-shaking resonance, onewonders why other choral groups can't find soloists this adept.;    Theorchestral players were superb. They included Robin Sutherland and David Higgs(both keyboard continuos), Julie Ann Giacobassi (double-reeds), Robin McKee(flute), Peter Shelton and Jill Brindel (both cello).;  St. Matthew's Passion; San Francisco Symphony and Chorus, Helmuth Rilling, conductor; Where: DaviesSymphony Hall, Van Ness Avenue at Grove Street, San Francisco; When: 7:30 p.m.Saturday; Tickets: $7-$46; Call: (415) 431-5400  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL HERTELENDY, Mercury News Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910329  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  541  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 29, 199100089134,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
