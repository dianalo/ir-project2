Thegoal endorsed by President Alfredo Cristiani, as well as the Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front, had been to push for a cease-fire ending the11-year war. One quid pro quo for ending the guerrilla attacks was astreamlining of procedures for amending the Salvadoran constitution.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ,5 U.S. SEEKS A STALEMATE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  CommentaryRandolph Ryan is a Boston Globe columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     That was crucial because many of the political issues under negotiationwill require changes in the constitution. At present, constitutionalamendments require passage by two successive assemblies, which requires atleast two years. As a consequence, the process functions as a drag onpeacemaking. Thus, the FMLN saw easing the amendment procedure as &quot;the issuethat opens the door to all of the other issues.&quot;;    The Salvadoran rightwing, which has been responsible for tens of thousands of civilian murdersduring the war, clearly regarded constitutional streamlining in the same way.Early in April a rightist group published a mock obituary notice in aSalvadoran paper. A question mark centered on a page with a black bordercarried the message: &quot;This space is reserved for the names of the 10traitor-deputies who would endorse the reform of Article 248 of theConstitution.&quot;;    Yet there was significant progress in Mexico on someissues, such as reform of the military, that have vexed the negotiations foryears.;    The Mexico round produced a specific agreement-to-agree, sortingout points that will require constitutional amendments from those that can beenacted with legislation. The agreement covers four areas: the armed forces;the judicial system and human rights; the electoral system; and a &quot;commissionon the truth,&quot; intended to write a report (comparable, perhaps, to the onepending from the U.S. special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra affair) fixingresponsibility for the most notorious criminal acts during the 1980s.;    Theareas of movement toward a settlement should not be minimized. A framework hasbegun to emerge for imposing checks and balances on the military, putting thehigh command under civilian control, and separating police and intelligencefunctions.;    A similar agenda aims to insulate the judiciary from thepolitical controls which (coupled with terror) have made Salvadoran justice amacabre joke. Yet the refusal of the assembly, dominated by Cristiani'sright-wing Arena Party, to streamline the constitutional-amendment process wascalculated to keep the war going.;    What of the U.S. role on the sidelinesof these talks? The Bush administration appears ambivalent on peace, willingto see it break out, sort of, but not any time soon.;    The administration isnot driven by the crazed zeal of the Reaganauts like Elliott Abrams who werein charge a few years ago. Abrams' successor, Bernard Aronson, is, incontrast, smug and in no special hurry.;    The administration understandsthat the FMLN is solidly committed to peace. Moreover, it realizes that forthe FMLN to have reached a consensus for negotiations was a ponderous processthat cannot be easily reversed. Given the existing stalemate, there is no riskin continuing the fighting, and hence no urgency for peace.;    Confident thatthe FMLN will grow weaker, the administration angles steadily for marginallybetter deals for its client, the Salvadoran government and army. One dayAronson excuses obvious foot-dragging on the investigation of the 1989 Jesuitmassacre. Another day he cites secret intelligence and blames an oppositionnewspaper for an arson attack on itself. Meanwhile, the army is promised newand improved attack helicopters.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RANDOLPH RYAN  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910503  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  630  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 3, 199100124143,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
