The closest Bush came to discussing his recent differences withlabor was when he told the delegates: ``There's a lot more to therelationship between the White House and the labor organizationsthan one issue or another. ... We have had honest differences butwe agree on goals and what matters is that we make progress onissues of shared concern.''   Bush was received politely by the union delegates but came underfire later in the day on Capitol Hill, where Democrats leading thelabor-backed effort to raise the minimum wage chastised thepresident for refusing to negotiate with them and accused him ofturning his back on the nation's working poor.   ``President Bush has been poorly advised to test his politicalmuscle on innocent victims of an inadequate minimum wage; the old,the young, the disadvantaged and even the ambitious trying to paythe escalating cost of education,'' said Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa.   The Democrats compared Bush's promise to veto their minimum-wagebill with his efforts to expand capital gains tax breaks, aproposal whose benefits would primarily be enjoyed predominantly bywealthy Americans.   ``The president ought to have as much concern for the poor as hedoes for the rich,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.   Labor had several visible confrontations with former PresidentReagan on issues like the firing of striking air trafficcontrollers and White House opposition to legislation requiringemployers to give workers advance notice of plant closings. Butlabor's lasting resentment toward Bush's predecessor stems morefrom what they considered to be staunchly anti-union appointmentsto the National Labor Relations Board.   Bush took pains to avoid exciting the labor animosity thatflourished during the Reagan years. He praised the already cordialcrowd and improved his standing with labor leaders by promising tomake NLRB appointments ``whose neutrality and integrity are abovereproach.''   ``My appointments will not be anti-labor or, as I say,anti-business. They will be based on fair trade,'' Bush said, as ashout of ``Amen'' was heard from one Texas delegate in theapplauding audience.   ``That is indeed a welcome step,'' said AFL-CIO spokesman RexHardesty.   Bush also praised the group's patriotism, role in the nation'seconomic growth and efforts on behalf of Poland's Solidaritymovement, saying ``wherever the free trade movement is threatened,so too is democracy.''   But noticeably missing from the speech were any directreferences to Bush's promise to veto minimum wage bills that havecleared the House and Senate or his refusal to intervene to block astrike that has grounded Eastern for nearly two months.   Union leaders said the omissions were not surprising.   ``I wouldn't expect him to discuss those fronts,'' said Hardesty.   ``It might have turned the audience (against him) real fast,''said another union official who asked not to be identified.   Bush has promised to veto the minimum wage measures because theywould raise the base wage to $4.55 an hour, 30 cents an hour morethan the president supports, and do not contain a provisionallowing all new employees to be paid a subminimum wage for sixmonths. Bush has said such a ``training wage'' must be part of anyminimum wage increase for him to support it.   In refusing to exercise his authority to block the Easternstrike, Bush became the first president to ignore a recommendationof the National Mediation Board.   Those decisions have soured the early tone of labor's relationswith the Bush White House, but labor leaders still view Bush farmore favorably than they did Reagan.   And the group he appeared before Tuesday was among the safest ofunion audiences for Bush. The president of the AFL-CIO Building andConstruction Trades Department, Robert A. Georgine, is a longtimeacquaintance of the president and among the unions represented atthe conference was the Teamsters, the only major union to endorseBush in the presidential race.   Georgine introduced Bush as ``one of the finest individuals thiscountry has ever produced'' and said the president ``can differwith you philosophically or politically and still hold yourrespect, and you his.''   Bush was warmly received by the delegates, who gave him standingovations when he entered and left. Missing, however, was thecheering and other signs of enthusiasm that punctuated ovationsMonday for House Speaker Jim Wright and Mitchell.   Mitchell told the delegates ``the president is against us'' andhad urged them to question Bush about the minimum wage. But therewas no opportunity for them to do so.</TEXT></DOC>
