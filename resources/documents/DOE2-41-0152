<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-41-0152 </DOCNO><TEXT>An experiment was conducted at the Advanced Test Accelerator (ATA) inthe spring/summer of 1988 to study the transport of the ``laser guided''electron beam through the accelerator and beyond. The electron beam wasguided from the {approximately}3.75 MeV point through the acceleratoron an ion channel created by firing a KrF laser (248 nm, P {approx}100--400mJ) into a benzene filled (p {approx}.1 {mu}) beamline. Beam transportwas documented at several locations with a variety of diagnostics forvarious beam parameters; channel, gas, and laser parameters; and forvarious machine configurations. The focus of this experiment was to document,understand, and then alter (remove) the time variation in the observedaccelerated beam parameters. The temporal variation of the beam manifestsitself in several ways as has been documented. Beam radius versus time,R(t), from both bow probe and optical data shows the beam radius expandingby factors of up to several over the 40 ns of beam pulse. When the beamis threaded through any device with a limited acceptance the radius variationis parlayed into a current variation, I(t). This has been documentedfor transport through the fusible link, rise time sharpener, slits, bends,emittance selectors, and during free expansion. The beam temporal variationin time may be viewed as radius increase or blowup, brightness degradation,or emittance increase. The observations of blowup predate the introductionof the collimator. The observations prior to this experiment were madein the post accelerator transport sections. 9 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
