The newcredit facility matures in March 1993, and will be guaranteedby Hitachi Metals Ltd., with which Applied Magnetics hasworked for several years. It will be used to retireoutstanding balances on an existing $15 million revolvingcredit facility. The company currently has about $75 millionin debt, Michael S. Noling, executive vice president andchief financial officer, said. While the company willcontinue to work on its long-term capital structure, the newagreements should provide some breathing room for the currentyear, Mr. Noling said. Applied Magnetics, a Goleta, Calif.,maker of magnetic recording heads for the computer industry,went into technical default after posting a $26 million lossin the fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sept. 30. The newagreements replace an earlier pact reached with lenders inDecember, which would have reduced total credit available to$50 million and required that it be secured by substantiallyall of the company's domestic assets.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
