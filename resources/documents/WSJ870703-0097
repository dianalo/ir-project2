The suit, filed by a group of 57 former pilots, station agents and ramp handlers, also claims Frontier funds were diverted to People Express before it acquired Frontier in 1985.    Both People Express and Frontier have since been acquired by Texas Air Corp., and operate under the Continental name. People and Frontier still exist as paper corporations, while lawsuits against them remain unresolved.    According to the suit, $55 million of Frontier assets were illegally diverted to People Express before directors filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law on behalf of Frontier in August 1986. The action left insufficient money to pay creditors, including employees, the suit said.    William C. Waller Jr., attorney for the employees, said they can sue as legal creditors because they signed an agreement with People Express in 1985, agreeing to work for half their contractual pay in exchange for People agreeing not to sell Frontier's assets.    A Texas Air spokesman said: &quot;This is an attempt by a small group of former employees to enhance the value of their already inflated claims filed in the Frontier bankruptcy court.&quot;    According to a recent stock prospectus, several suits against People Express are pending in connection with its Texas Air merger; the suits have been filed by shareholders, employees and creditors. </TEXT></DOC>
