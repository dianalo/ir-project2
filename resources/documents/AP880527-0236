America First Financial Corp. of San Francisco will contributeanother $100 million to the package and acquire Eureka's depositsand 35 branch offices in northern California. The offices willremain open under the Eureka name.   The bank board will contribute $291 million in cash from theFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures Sandamp;Ldeposits up to $100,000, to cover Eureka's negative net worth.   The remaining $23 million in estimated costs to the insurancefund, which is funded through fees charged the industry, will comefrom the purchase of loan participations and coverage of AmericaFirst against future loss on problems loans and against challengesto the rescue package.   As part of the deal, the bank board will receive $50 millionstock in America First, an affiliate of America First Companies ofOmaha, Neb., and share equally in tax benefits arising from thetransaction.   Eureka, with $1.74 billion in assets as of March 31, was foundedin 1937. It's been in trouble since the early 1980s, when interestrates soared, leaving many Sandamp;Ls holding low-rate mortgages.   The bank board, in a release, also attributed the insolvency to``unsafe and unsound loan underwriting practices.''   Bank board Chairman, M. Danny Wall, the top federal regulator ofSandamp;Ls, said the rescue was ``especially significant'' because of theamount of private investment in the deal, which is a record for anSandamp;L rescue.   ``This transaction is further evidence ... that the thriftindustry is a good place to invest for the future,'' Wall said in astatement.   The Eureka deal is the 34th bailout or shutdown of a failed Sandamp;L.Twenty-three of the 34 were acquired by investors or merged withexisting institutions with FSLIC assistance.</TEXT></DOC>
