Among those arrested was head Sikh priest Jasbir Singh Rode. Histalks Wednesday with government officials to try to end thefour-day confrontation at the 400-year-old temple were inconclusive.   Two Sikh militants were killed this afternoon in a heavyexchange of fire with security forces on the temple's perimeter,police said. A third was seriously injured.   The deaths raised to at least 14 the number of people killedsince shooting broke out Monday at the temple, Sikhism's holiestshrine. Eleven others have been injured.   Rode has called for the estimated 100 Sikh extremists inside thetemple complex to dismantle their bunkers and for the 2,500 policeand paramilitary forces ringing the shrine to withdraw.   The priest and his followers were arrested at another Sikhshrine about a third of a mile north of the Golden Temple as theywere about to start marching in defiance of a police ban.   Deputy Police Commissioner Sarbjeet Singh asked the group tocall off the march because two bursts of gunfire inside the templewere reported this morning after an overnight lull.   Punjab Police Chief K.P.S. Gill told a news conference thatthere were no plans to end the siege. Asked where it was leading,Gill said: ``We are waiting to see how the situation develops.''   ``We want the militants to stop firing so that normalcy can berestored,'' he added.   ``We take responsibility for any firing from inside thetemple,'' Rode responded. ``You take responsibility for firing fromoutside.''   Sikh militants placed a medium-sized machine gun atop a towerinside the complex and were in a position to fire down on anyone inthe area.   The Sikhs have also built fortifications on the northern edge ofthe complex, from which police Tuesday evacuated 800 pilgrims tokeep them out of the crossfire.   All shops and businesses in the old, walled sector of Amritsarwhich surrounds the temple remained shuttered today and peoplestayed off the streets as a police-imposed curfew entered itsfourth day.   State-run All India Radio said the government was trying toensure that milk and other supplies reach civilians in curfew-boundareas.   Police had hoped to lift the curfew Wednesday, but the effortfailed.   The temple complex covers an area equivalent to more than fivecity blocks, and includes offices, hostels and dining halls.   The Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as analternative to Hinduism and Islam, claim they are discriminatedagainst by India's majority Hindus.   Sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1983for more autonomy for an independent homeland in Punjab state.Sikhs make up less than two percent of India's 800 million peopleand Punjab is the only state where they are a majority.   More than 940 people have been killed this year in Punjab inattacks blamed on the extremists. Most have been Hindus or moderateSikhs opposed to the separatist campaign.   The Indian army was sent into the Golden Temple complex in June1984 to drive Sikh extremists from the shrine. More than 1,200people were killed in the attack, including Jarnail SinghBhindranwale, a militant Sikh preacher.   Later that year, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinatedby two of her Sikh bodyguards in revenge.</TEXT></DOC>
