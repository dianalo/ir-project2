Warburg andamp; Co., the London-based merchant bank, said Philip Keevil, a partner at Lazard Freres andamp; Co., will become head of its mergers and acquisitions operation in the U.S.    Mr. Keevil, 41 years old, had been cohead of the international department at Lazard, where he had been a partner since 1983. Warburg is a unit of S.G. Warburg Group, London.    A Lazard spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.    In the past few years, several foreign firms have been trying to recruit top U.S. investment bankers, generally with limited success. Moreover, partners rarely leave Lazard, a small but highly profitable New York securities firm.    Mr. Keevil said he was attracted to Warburg because of its strength in international banking and because of the opportunity to build the mergers and acquisitions department there.    He added that he didn't see many top management slots opening up at Lazard soon. Felix Rohatyn, Lazard's top mergers and acquisitions specialist, is &quot;still a relatively young man,&quot; Mr. Keevil said. &quot;This is my chance to be top dog.&quot;    Warburg has doubled its staff in the U.S. to about 200 in the past two years. </TEXT></DOC>
