Most of the action stemmed from book-squaring and short-covering, or buying contracts to offset those sold earlier, brokers said. &quot;Half the floor is sitting down, and most of the major players are out of the market,&quot; said Bill Hinton, an oil broker for Balfour Maclaine International Ltd., New York.    Selling by local traders, or those trading for their own account, pushed prices lower early in the session, analysts said, but a late spurt of oil-company buying led prices to their highs for the day.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures for February delivery rose 36 cents to $17.27 a barrel. The session's high was $17.30. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts also posted moderate advances.    Spot, or non-contract, prices also rose in the U.S. and Europe. West Texas Intermediate, the barometer of U.S. crude oil prices, closed at $17.25 a barrel, up 35 cents. And the January price of North Sea Brent, the abundantly traded European blend, rose 15 cents to $17.05 in late trading.    Analysts said some buying was prompted by reports that Saudi Arabia and Nigeria had told various U.S. oil companies they will end netback crude oil sales Feb. 1 and replace them with fixed prices of about $18 a barrel. Netbacks, in which producers offer crude at prices tied to quotes for refined products, have helped drive down oil prices for most of this year, according to oil analysts.    Nevertheless, few speculators were willing to leave contract positions open before the holiday weekend, some brokers said; the New York Merc will be closed today.    &quot;Many customers are just evening things up,&quot; said Richard Marose, senior oil analyst for Geldermann Inc., Chicago. For the time being, he said, $17 a barrel is expected to be the &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; price in the oil futures market.    Meanwhile, precious metals prices inched up in extremely thin trading. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold contracts for December delivery rose $1.50 an ounce to $390.20; December silver closed at $5.30 an ounce, up 0.7 cent. And platinum for January delivery on the New York Merc rose $4.50 to $471.80 an ounce.    There weren't any major news developments driving the metals markets, and prices moved in a narrow range, analysts said.    &quot;Many of us came in for insurance -- to make sure nothing kooky happened,&quot; one trader in New York said. &quot;It didn't.&quot;    In other futures markets Wednesday:    CURRENCIES: Japanese yen futures rose in thin trading as brokers with short, or selling, positions bought the currency to even up their positions ahead of the holiday. The yen has trailed other currencies in their recent gains. &quot;The yen was making up for lost ground,&quot; James M. Florsheim, a vice president of Chicago Corp., said. Analysts said the currency was aided by news that a Bank of Japan official said some market-watchers consider the yen undervalued. Other currencies closed mixed, with much of the activity confined to independent traders.    LIVESTOCK AND MEAT: Live cattle prices rose slightly, but hog and pork belly prices fell fractionally in thin trading. &quot;The whole day was kind of a nothing,&quot; said Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc., St. Louis. Analysts said hog prices apparently retreated because of concern that farmers have withheld many animals from the market, increasing the potential for large deliveries later. Cattle prices were up marginally, traders said, on signs of a slight improvement on the cash markets.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices barely moved in lethargic, almost featureless trading. Analysts said corn prices, which inched as much as 1.25 cents a bushel higher, rose solely because traders were covering short, or selling, positions. However, word that China had purchased a small amount of corn could push prices higher today, analysts said. &quot;It's not the volume, but the fact that it's China, and they haven't been buying a lot of grains from us,&quot; Richard Loewy, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said. </TEXT></DOC>
