They discuss the sale of anoil refinery.   No sooner does the meeting end than they start another one-- about selling the company's airplanes. Then, it's off toprepare for the next day's meeting, on disposing of drillingequipment. &quot;If they leave us here another six months, therewon't be anything left,&quot; one executive says in jest.</LP><TEXT>   Asset-stripping raiders? No, these men run a state-ownedcompany. And the company, YPF S.A., is Argentina's biggest.It also has long been considered an unassailable trade-unionbastion. Even more astounding, YPF produces oil, which allover the continent is much more than a commodity; it is theheretofore-untouchable symbol of national independence.   But now, under a state-appointed president, JoseEstenssoro, YPF is undergoing what consultants at McKinsey andamp;Co. call &quot;one of the most complex changes ever faced by astate-owned Latin American company.&quot; Trying to makecash-strapped YPF competitive in a deregulated environment,Mr. Estenssoro plans a steady diet of asset sales and jointventures.   &quot;It's a classic case of downsizing, as they'd say on WallStreet,&quot; a foreign oil executive comments. And it is just thebeginning. Mr. Estenssoro's ultimate aim is to float YPFshares on a foreign stock exchange, thus taking control outof the state's hands.   &quot;We're not pulling any punches,&quot; Mr. Estenssoro says.&quot;We're here to transform YPF and make it a private-sectorcompany, if possible.&quot;   That is a big &quot;if,&quot; of course. But if he overcomespolitical, labor and cultural opposition and succeeds, thefree-market revolution sweeping Latin America would get amajor boost. &quot;In Latin America, oil is similar to the sacredcows in India, and, here, oil isn't sacred anymore,&quot; saysRicardo Zinn, who heads the Transformation Commission set upby Mr. Estenssoro to oversee the process. &quot;This could be alesson for others in Latin America. It would prove that youcan reorganize a state company in an orderly fashion in themost sensitive sector in the economy.&quot;   Indeed, the projected transformation of YPF is a test caseof the changes sought by President Carlos Menem in Argentinaand by his counterparts throughout the region. Over the pastfew years, South America has gone through economic andpolitical revolutions as startling, though less publicized,as Eastern Europe's. Military or populist regimes have beenshed in favor of democratically elected governments, andstatist dogma -- the economic nationalism, state ownership,protectionism, monopolies, subsidies and price controls --has yielded to market economics.   Capitalism is in vogue. Foreign companies are beingwelcomed. South American governments are selling stateassets, cutting tariffs, curbing public spending andliberalizing economies as they seek to make up for the &quot;lostdecade&quot; of the 1980s by reducing their debts and deficits andresuming economic growth.   In the drive to privatize state companies, everything fromairlines to zoos is on the block. Argentina has already soldoff its flag carrier and its telephone company, and dozens ofother assets, including utilities and railways, are up forgrabs. Mexico recently sold its phone company. Venezuela hassold two banks and is looking for buyers for its telephonecompany, airline, ports and even a Caracas racecourse.Brazil, after much delay, has announced plans to float 27companies. Looking for a cheese factory? Honduras is sellingone. Maybe a hotel? Talk to the Bolivian government.   However, a look at some of Mr. Estenssoro's problems inhis 11 months on the job -- already close to a longevityrecord for recent YPF presidents -- indicates how tough atask lies ahead and why, so far, Argentina has witnessed moretalk of freemarket reform than action.   YPF embodies the ills of most publicsector companies inSouth America. The company, says Octavio Frigerio, whobriefly ran it in 1989, is &quot;a monster of inefficiency.&quot; Headds, &quot;It has three times more employees than it needs andfor a long time its monopoly {on oil exploration} paralyzedproduction and investment.&quot;   Created in 1922, YPF was the world's first state-owned oilcompany, and for years it enjoyed a monopoly on explorationand production in Argentina. It grew quickly, and its 1990sales of $9.4 billion made it Latin America's fourth-largestconcern, trailing only the oil giants of Mexico, Venezuelaand Brazil.   But this growth took some strange turns. In 1958, YPF'sthen-president visited its refinery in La Plata and found anaspirin plant there. Why? The in-house welfare systemconsumed a lot of aspirin, so YPF produced it. Similarly, Mr.Zinn says, &quot;YPF is one of the few oil companies in the worldthat drills for itself&quot; instead of subcontracting. Why?&quot;Because due to the concept of national sovereignty, youcan't depend on the private sector to drill, prospect -- orclean the bathroom,&quot; he says. So YPF has a drilling team of2,500 employees and sometimes has drilled just to keep thembusy, executives say.   Over the years, YPF also &quot;carried the development of thecountry,&quot; says Pedro Taylor, coordinator of theTransformation Commission. &quot;If you needed a school, ahospital, an airport, a supermarket, a cinema, YPF wouldbuild them because they would serve people working for YPF.&quot;Meanwhile, to fight inflation, the government held downgasoline prices.   All this was bound to hurt YPF. It says it had a loss of$257 million in 1989 -- the most recent year for whichfigures are available -- but some oil-industry analysts saythat in some years it could have posted losses as deep as $2billion.   &quot;A company of this size and in this business losing moneyis an oddity,&quot; says Raul Oreste, YPF vice president for humanresources, &quot;but when a provincial government didn't havemoney, what would it do? It would stop paying YPF forsupplies. If the government needed money, what did it do? Itwould get it from YPF. Everyone took and no one gave, and thecompany nearly collapsed.&quot;   Into this mess stepped Mr. Estenssoro, who last Augustbecame YPF's third president since Mr. Menem took office lessthan two years ago. For a company traditionally headed bypolitical appointees, the choice was startling. The57-year-old, Bolivian-born Mr. Estenssoro is an oil man whospent most of his professional life working for Houston-basedHughes Tool Co. (now Baker Hughes Inc.), and he speaks fluentEnglish with a Texas drawl.   His ideas for YPF were startling, too. &quot;YPF is a companythat requires profits to perform,&quot; he said at the outset.&quot;Without profits, it's the end of YPF.&quot;   He quickly showed he meant business. When the police forceat the Quinta de Olivos, the presidential residence, didn'tpay for its gasoline, he cut off supplies. Within days, thebill was settled.   With McKinsey's help, Mr. Estenssoro drew up arestructuring plan calling for YPF to concentrate onexploring for and producing oil. The plan aims to raise about$1 billion by 1992 through asset sales or joint ventures withdomestic or foreign oil companies, while halving YPF's staffof 35,000 and reducing its crude-oil production to abouttwo-thirds of its current 380,000 barrels a day. &quot;I don'twant a bigger YPF; I want a more efficient YPF,&quot; Mr.Estenssoro says. Meanwhile, he adds, YPF's joint-venturepartners should increase Argentina's oil output.   YPF has already formed joint ventures, as a passivepartner, with private oil companies to exploit 28 marginalproduction areas and four high-potential areas. This hasbrought more than $800 million into the government's coffersat a crucial time in its economic-stabilization program.   The restructuring plan also calls for YPF to cede two morebasins to the private sector and sell three refineries, somepipelines, part of its maritime fleet, all its airplanes andmost of its nonstrategic services such as drillingoperations. &quot;We are trying to turn an elephant into apanther,&quot; says the transformation team's Mr. Taylor.   Mr. Estenssoro also negotiated a new labor contract withSUPE, the powerful in-house union, removing 2,600management-level executives from labor's scrutiny -- and, hesays, interference. &quot;Since 1974, nobody who sat in my chair,even during the {1976-83} military regime, was totally freeto run YPF without the union having a say in all decisions,&quot;he says. &quot;The labor contract was a model of how to controlmanagement without having the responsibility. Everything,including the general manager's salary, transfers, hiring andfiring or promotions, was included in the labor contract.&quot;   Labor relations have been overhauled against a backdrop ofderegulation of Argentina's oil and gas industry. YPF's lackof funds had already forced former President Raul Alfonsin topermit private companies to search for oil, but what theyfound had to be sold to YPF. Now, Mr. Menem allows them todispose of their oil freely. That triggered an investmentboom. One industry expert says 40 foreign oil companies nowoperate in Argentina and will invest about $3 billion overthree years. Mr. Menem has also lifted all controls ongasoline prices, unleashing a price war between YPF and otherretailers. The upshot of this and other changes: YPF expectsa 1991 profit of about $300 million -- still a paltry sumcompared with major foreign oil companies.   But every change has sparked a fight. When Mr. Estenssoroarrived, he noticed that no one clocked in. The company hadordered a magnetic-card system for employees but never hadinstalled it because of union opposition. Mr. Estenssorodecided to go ahead -- but the cards mysteriouslydisappeared. New ones were ordered, and now everyone, fromMr. Estenssoro on down, clocks in.   Then came death threats. &quot;We received fake sticks ofdynamite with clock mechanisms, accompanied by small cardssaying, `This is the beginning, don't wait for the end,' &quot;Mr. Estenssoro says. Their origin has never been traced.   The government picks on Mr. Estenssoro, too. Whennewspapers disclosed that he was making $10,000 a month,Defense Minister Erman Gonzalez was reported to have saidduring a cabinet meeting: &quot;How can I contain the generals'demands {for higher military pay} when Estenssoro earns$10,000 a month?&quot; Mr. Estenssoro gave in; he said he wouldstick to a public servant's salary of $1,000 a month.   So far, these attacks are what Mr. Zinn calls &quot;guerrillawarfare.&quot; But many expect the fight to intensify whenCongress starts examining a bill allowing the privatizationof YPF. Antonio Cassia, president of the Chamber of Deputies'energy commission and a SUPE official, says he will try toensure that 51% of YPF remains in state hands. &quot;We're notagainst the transformation of YPF,&quot; he says, but &quot;Estenssorois trying to dismember YPF.&quot;   Others also expect conflicts when YPF sells assets. And itmight not be able to sell all it wants to sell. Aftervisiting the Dock Sud refinery near Buenos Aires, oneinvestment banker called it &quot;obsolete&quot; and &quot;on the border ofthe unsalable.&quot;   Can Mr. Estenssoro pull it all off? Luis Rey, president ofPluspetrol S.A., a private oil company, says the asset salesseem feasible, but he adds: &quot;What seems to me to be a missionimpossible is to make YPF a viable company. Turning astructure of 35,000 people into one of 15,000 requires amanagement and investment effort that the Argentine stateisn't able to fulfill.&quot; He suggests that YPF should be soldoff piecemeal. &quot;In a deregulated, diversified market, there'sno need for YPF,&quot; he says.   Mr. Frigerio, the former YPF head, also sees problems ifthe state retains even just a minority stake in the company.&quot;Either it has a private majority and there's no need forstate participation, or there's a state majority and therewill be no private investment,&quot; he says.   However, even the unions concede that Mr. Estenssoro hashad his way so far. &quot;We didn't think he'd last this long,&quot;says Evaristo Mareco, who heads the union at Dock Sud. &quot;He'ssurvived all the criticism, so it's clear he has politicalsupport.&quot;   And Mr. Estenssoro thinks he has a chance of keeping it.&quot;If I didn't think the chances were in my favor, I wouldn'thave committed suicide&quot; by taking on the task, he says.&quot;Mission Impossible always has a happy ending,&quot; he adds witha laugh.</TEXT></DOC>
