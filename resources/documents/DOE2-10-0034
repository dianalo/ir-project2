Thus, investments in solar installations may appear unattractivefrom a cash-flow viewpoint even when they make sense on a life-cyclecost basis. The study examined whether alternative financial instrumentscould be developed to overcome the tilt problem and whether Canadianfinancial institutions would be willing to offer financing on these terms.Legal and institutional questions about design of such financing wereinvestigated by interviewing those in the financial field. Computer modelswere developed to simulate financial patterns for a range of cases coveringSSWHS installations by different types of owners. The basic conclusionis that there is no evidence that a financing problem exists for SSWHS;the basic problem is that such systems are currently uneconomic becausethey cost too much and do not save enough on fuel costs to justify theirinstallation. Such systems are economic only when subsidized via capitalcost allowance provisions in the tax system. A major finding of the studyis that the timing of installation is critical to project economics.Financial institutions have been found willing to make loans for SSWHSand commercial/industrial retrofit loans, large enough to warrant specialtreatment, can be designed to match cash flow patterns to energy costsavings. However, financing could suffer because financial institutionsare unfamiliar with SSWHS economics and technology. 13 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
