Last week, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission struck down two-thirds of the fixed monthly fees that Chicago-based Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America charges customers for access to certain Canadian gas supplies. Natural Gas is controlled by Occidental Petroleum Corp., Los Angeles.    The decision is expected to set a precedent for most Canadian gas exports to the U.S., although it initially involves only 90 billion cubic feet of gas annually under contracts between Natural Gas and two suppliers, Calgary, Alberta-based Progas Ltd. and Toronto-based TransCanada PipeLines Ltd.    A Canadian energy official said a preliminary calculation shows the U.S. ruling could reduce Canadian gas producers' revenue from export sales by $140 million (U.S.) to $300 million, a drop of 9% to 19% from this year's level of about $1.6 billion. The calculation assumes that export volumes remain constant at about 760 billion cubic feet a year and that Canadian producers agree to absorb price cuts rather than cut back on contracted gas sales.    The official said Ottawa will express &quot;concern&quot; to the U.S. administration, partly because the U.S. ruling may inadvertently impinge on areas of Canadian jurisdiction. Progas and TransCanada, which operates Canada's biggest gas pipeline, said they will ask the commission to reconsider the decision. </TEXT></DOC>
