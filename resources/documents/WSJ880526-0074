Sease and David Wilson </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices ended mixed yesterday as trading activity continued to languish.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up most of the day, ended 1.16 lower at 1961.37. But advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange led decliners, 809-633. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.25 to close at 253.76, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.24 to 143.77. Big Board volume was 138.3 million shares, compared with 139.9 million Tuesday.    Analysts said the late sell-off in blue-chips was caused by traders positioning themselves for the release this morning of revised first-quarter gross national product data. According to the consensus forecast of economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the revision will put the quarter's growth rate at 3.2%, up from the original 2.3% estimate. Economists said the revision would be the result of higher-than-expected exports in March and an upward revision of March retail sales.    William LeFevre, senior vice president and portfolio strategist for Advest Inc., Hartford, Conn., said the expected upward revision will reinforce fears of the economy overheating and the Federal Reserve tightening credit to choke off inflation. On the other hand, he said, a lower-than-expected number could be what investors need to quit worrying about inflation.    In any case, he said, equity investors will keep their eye on the Treasury's long-term bonds, which currently yield around 9.30%, for clues to overall sentiment.    &quot;The first place you're going to see the beginning of the end for the inflation theory is in the long bond,&quot; he said. &quot;If yields on the long Treasurys dropped below 9%, that would be enough to trigger a lot of rethinking about inflation and stock values.&quot;    Edward G. Webb Jr., senior vice president of Bull andamp; Bear Group Inc., New York, said stock prices are attractive enough to warrant a return of buyers.    &quot;There's a lot of cash out there, earnings are good, and everybody's sold who wanted to,&quot; he said. &quot;There's got to be a trigger that will set it off, but I don't know what it is.&quot;    Mr. Webb said the turnaround, when it comes, will be marked by a surge in volume and an explosive rise in prices as investors rush to avoid being left behind. &quot;The door is narrow when everybody's trying to get out, and it can be just as narrow on the way in,&quot; he said.    Andrew Riley, a portfolio strategist at Yamaichi International Inc. in New York, agreed. He said he has begun advising portfolio managers in Japan to start moving cash into U.S. securities now if they want to participate in the U.S. stock market.    &quot;We're recommending they put 10% of their sideline cash into equities, not because we think the market is oversold, but because so much of the market has been illiquid that to build big positions they should be in before the market bottom,&quot; Mr. Riley said.    He said Japanese managers to whom he has talked are &quot;desperate to get into the U.S. market,&quot; but he said they continue to worry about the currency risks of investing in the U.S. Mr. Riley said he thinks the dollar has settled into a trading range between 120 yen and 130 yen and thus doesn't present much of a risk, &quot;but they remain unconvinced.&quot;    Federal National Mortgage Association added 1 1/8 to 38 1/8 in heavy trading. Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock and said higher interest rates will help Fannie Mae boost its portfolio, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.    Major banks and insurers also attracted buying interest. Citicorp rose 1/4 to 22 3/4, Bankers Trust added 1 3/8 to 33, and J.P. Morgan climbed 5/8 to 35 1/4; Aetna Life andamp; Casualty gained 3/8 to 42 1/8, Chubb advanced 3/4 to 55 3/4, Fireman's Fund tacked on 3/4 to 27 5/8, and General Re rose 1 3/8 to 52.    United Technologies fell 1 1/2 to 36 5/8 on news that its Pratt andamp; Whitney unit lost out to Rolls-Royce in a bid to provide engines for as many as 100 Boeing 757 jetliners. AMR, parent of American Airlines, agreed to order 50 of the planes from Boeing and acquired an option for 50 more. Boeing, which surged after AMR said late last week that it was holding talks about the order, dropped 1/4 to 53 5/8.    Texaco added 1 to 46 7/8 in heavy trading amid a flurry of rumors, the investor report said, including speculation that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts was raising its rumored 4.9% stake in the company and that investor Carl Icahn was about to begin a proxy fight. After the market closed, Mr. Icahn said he would make a friendly offer of $60 a share for Texaco.    Takeover speculation caused Upjohn to rise 2 1/8 to 31 1/4 on composite volume of 3.1 million shares and Rorer Group to jump 3 to 31 3/4. There were rumors that Upjohn would be the target of a $45-a-share offer from Du Pont, which declined to comment. Analysts told the investor report that interest in Rorer may have resulted from the company's current meetings with analysts and brokers in the Midwest and from higher-than-expected sales of Factor 8, a hemophilia drug.    West Point-Pepperell jumped 4 3/8 to 35 3/4. The company said Farley filed for federal clearance to acquire between 15% and 25% of its common. The filing didn't say whether Farley already holds a stake in Pepperell, the company said.    Tenneco leaped 4 3/8 to 45 3/4 as the company put its oil and gas subsidiary up for sale. Tenneco said it will consider selling the unit, which had sales of $3.3 billion last year, either in major segments or as a whole.    Newhall Land andamp; Farming climbed 3 7/8 to 40 1/8. Documents filed in connection with a lawsuit against the partnership disclosed that its largest unit holder, Ezra Zilkha, made two overtures about a leveraged buyout in recent months, The Wall Street Journal reported. The documents also said Newhall received &quot;expressions of interest&quot; from investors Robert M. Bass, Roy E. Disney and William E. Simon and the Belzberg family of Canada.    American Stock Exchange volume was eight million shares, compared with 8,480,000 Tuesday. There were 273 issues advancing, 258 declining and 271 unchanged. The American Stock Exchange index added 0.06 to 290.58.    Alza gained 1 1/8 to 21 5/8. The company signed an agreement for the Janssen Pharmaceutica unit of Johnson andamp; Johnson to market its drug-delivery system in the U.S. and certain other countries. </TEXT></DOC>
