During a meeting with reporters, Sessions said the question ofwhether to ban assault weapons like the AK-47 Soviet-style riflethat was used by a gunman to kill five California school childrenrequired a political judgment he wouldn't make.   ``It's not my responsibility to make that kind of decision,''Sessions said.   But the FBI director said ``the presence of these weapons doeshave a very destructive impact on American society and the people.''   ``Tragedy after tragedy flows from it,'' Sessions said. ``Peopleand law enforcement officers are victims of these crimes.''   ``I am sorry we are outgunned and outmanned in that respect,''the director said, echoing sentiments of many local law enforcementofficials who have asked Congress to ban semiautomatic assaultweapons such as the Soviet AK-47.   President Bush has resisted calls to ban the weapons that weremade in the wake of the Jan. 17 shooting at a Stockton, Calif.,elementary school where five children died when a gunman sparyedthem with more than 100 rounds from a Soviet-style AK-47 rifle.   But Bush, a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association,said earlier this week that he wants to find a way to prevent thecriminal use of these weapons while doing ``what's right by thelegitimate sportsman.''   Bush said he has directed drug-czar-designate William Bennett tostudy the proliferation of the semiautomatic weapons.   Critics say the guns can be easily altered to make them automaticdespite legal prohibitions on such weapons.   Sessions, meanwhile, defended the FBI's background investigationof former Texas Sen. John Tower, whose nomination as defensesecretary was rejected Thursday by the Senate.   ``The bureau carried out its function in this case as I'm sure itdid in hundreds of other cases,'' Sessions said, adding he saw ``noneed to change at all'' the FBI's procedures for conductingbackground checks on Cabinet nominees.   Some senators have criticized the bureau as helping spreadinnuendo and rumors in its investigation of Tower, whose drinkinghabits, relationships with women and financial ties to the defenseindustry came under fire.   Floyd Clarke, the bureau's director of investigations, said theFBI is careful to verify derogatory allegations made about anominee, including questioning the individual about the charges.   Sessions, who personally removed himself from the Tower casebecause of his past political ties with the former senator, said theWhite House had not criticized the FBI's handling of theinvestigation.   Sessions said he intended to serve out his 10-year term as FBIdirector. The director said reports that Attorney General DickThornburgh was trying to remove him were ``as much a surprise to meas anyone.''   ``I intend to serve out... my full term,'' Sessions said.   But Sessions acknowledged that he had stopped meeting informallywith members of Congress at FBI headquarters, a practice whichreportedly drew objections from Thornburgh.   ``I see the attorney general of the United States as the personfor whom I work at the Department of Justice,'' Sessions said. ``Iagree fully with his one-voice concept,'' he said, referring toThornburgh's repeated injunction that the department ``speak withone voice.''</TEXT></DOC>
