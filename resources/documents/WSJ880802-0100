Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> JUS </G><TEXT>   When the U.S. Attorney in Chicago brought racketeering charges last week against a former lawyer accused of insider trading, he set a precedent that is likely to alter the way future insider-trading cases are prosecuted.    The racketeering charge, the first to be brought in an insider-trading case, was endorsed specifically by the Justice Department. And government attorneys and lawyers who defend so-called white collar criminals say the potent and controversial federal racketeering law may soon be a staple in such cases.    In the Chicago case, prosecutors charged Alfred Elliott, who allegedly made $687,187 through insider trading, on 70 different counts, including the violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.    &quot;If RICO is used successfully by one U.S. Attorney's office, there tends to be a coat-tailing effect,&quot; said Robert G. Morvillo, a New York defense attorney. &quot;No U.S. Attorney wants to look less vigorous than his brethren. I would expect you'll see many more of these cases in the future.&quot;    The Justice Department, which must approve any cases brought under RICO, won't comment on whether racketeering charges will be used more often in future insider-trading cases. &quot;We'd rather not advertise what our intentions are,&quot; said Paul Coffey, deputy chief of the agency's organized crime and racketeering section.    But Mr. Coffey said &quot;breach of trust in the financial community is considered a very serious matter.&quot; He added that whether an individual illegally &quot;earns $600,000 or $600 million, in a case where there's a pattern of violations, it's appropriate to use RICO.&quot;    Under the RICO law, passed in 1970, a person or business that commits two or more felonies as part of a pattern can be charged with racketeering. RICO, which was intended largely as a federal weapon against organized crime, carries penalties that include triple damages, confiscation of property and up to 20 years in prison. RICO has been used most successfully in the prosecution of organized crime and drug-related cases.    Many defense attorneys worry that in using racketeering charges in insider-trading cases, the government may be abusing the RICO law. &quot;Sanctions under the federal securities laws are stringent enough&quot; to punish insider traders, said Gary Naftalis, a New York securities attorney. Other federal statutes provide for terms of up to five years for insider trading.    Using RICO in these cases is &quot;overkill and unnecessary and creates more controversy&quot; surrounding the statute, which some legislators have argued has been used too often, said Thomas Puccio, a New York lawyer and former U.S. Attorney.    But Mr. Coffey defended the use of the RICO statute in insider-trading cases. &quot;We think insider trading is just as serious as arson or insurance fraud or mail fraud,&quot; he said.    Many lawyers believe that RICO may be applied in cases that are expected to result from the investigation of Wall Street's insider-trading scandal. Indeed, Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, hinted to securities lawyers in a speech earlier this year that his office may bring federal racketeering charges.    But RICO isn't likely to be used in every future insider-trading case. Prosecutors say its use is likely to be reserved for the most egregious of insider-trading crimes. Moreover, because RICO is a complicated statute to explain to juries, its use is likely to be limited to major cities that have had the most experience using the statute in other criminal areas. </TEXT></DOC>
