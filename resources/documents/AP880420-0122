In a news conference here today, the family accused the Contrasof having ``brutally executed'' Linder on April 28, 1987 innorthern Nicaragua, where he was helping to build a hydroelectricplant.   The suit filed in federal court here accused Contra directorsAdolfo Calero and Aristides Sanchez and rebel military leadersEnrique Bermudez and Indalecia Rodriguez with ``wrongful death,battery, and cruel and inhuman treatment'' of Linder, as well asthe Contra organizations themselves.   Documents, including some obtained through the Freedom ofInformation Act, show the 27-year-old Linder was executed as he layinjured on the ground, the family said.   ``We know that Ben was murdered,'' Dr. David Linder, father ofthe victim, said today. ``Although our lawsuit cannot bring Benback, we want to make those responsible pay for their crimes, byforcing them to pay substantial damages, and by exposing theirguilt to the world.''   ``I would like to know more about the complicity of the (Reagan)administration,'' Linder said. ``I don't see why they are sosecretive if they don't know anything about it.''   Jorge Rosales, spokesman for the Nicaraguan Resistance, as theContras are formally called, said today he had no comment yet onthe suit.   The Linders, who are from Portland, Ore., said theirinvestigation shows that despite Contra claims to the contrary,volunteers helping the Sandinista government were deliberatelysought out by the rebels.   ``Ben's death was no accident,'' said the father. ``He and hisco-workers were targeted by the Contras because they were bringingelectricity to poor Nicaraguans.''   Said David Linder, ``the orders came from top Contra leaders,who must be brought to justice.''   Michael Ratner, attorney for the Linders, said the U.S. StateDepartment had refused to cooperate in the family's investigationof Benjamin Linder's death.   Ratner said he believes the State Department coached the Contratroops in their subsequent statements about the killing. He said itwas possible the U.S. government would be sued separately at alater time.   In an autopsy released last June by the family, Dr. MichaelBaden said Linder had been shot in the head from ``less than oneinch'' after suffering non-fatal wounds in an ambush on the project.   The family today produced a State Department memo that indicateda physician retained by the department to review the case believedthere was no doubt Benjamin Linder was shot at point-blank range.   The Contras publicly have said Linder was armed, and was killedin a firefight between rebels and government troops.   The New York Times reported last year that the rebelsacknowledged the killing privately and said Linder was mistaken fora Cuban adviser to the Sandinistas.   The Linders said they will be represented in the case by the NewYork-based Center for Constitutional Rights.   The family also said they will leave Friday for Nicaragua, wherethey will participate in activities commemorating the anniversaryof Linder's death, and deliver a check for $250,000 to complete thedevelopment project Linder was working on when he was killed.</TEXT></DOC>
