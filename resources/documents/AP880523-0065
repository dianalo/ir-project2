The 18 foreign hostages believed held in the slums were a keyfactor in the negotiations between the two countries, one of thenewspapers said.   Police said the Syrian-backed Amal militia and pro-IranianHezbollah forces battled for an 18th straight day today, tradingfire with rockets and mortars and leaving five people dead and 46wounded. The two factions are fighting for control of the 16 squaremiles of slums. At least 271 people have been killed and 919wounded since the fighting broke out May 6.   Iran has proposed forming a joint military force with Syria andmoving into the slums to stop the fighting, according to reportstoday in Beirut's two leading dailies, the independent An-Nahar andthe leftist As-Safir.   The papers said that Amal officials and Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud,Syria's military intelligence chief in west Beirut, rejected theoffer and insisted that the Syrian army take exclusive charge ofsecurity in south Beirut.   The papers said the Iranian offer was proposed by Deputy ForeignMinister Hossein Sheikholeslam during an overnight meeting withHammoud and Amal officials. Representatives of Hezbollah, or Partyof God, also reportedly attended the meeting.   An-Nahar said Sheikholeslam also declared two conditions forapproving a Syrian military intervention in the slums. They were:   _Resolving the problem of the hostages, who include nineAmericans, ``in a way that serves the objective for which they werekidnapped.'' He did not elaborate, but said it was a ``vital issuefor Iran.''   _Guarantees that Hezbollah would be free to continue politicalactivities in the slums after the Syrian deployment.   The two dailies said the differences probably will delay theentry of Syrian troops into the slums while further contacts weremade between Syrian President Hafez Assad and Iranian President AliKhamenei.   Syria has had 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored vehiclesmassed around the slums since Sunday, after Hezbollah overran Amalstrongholds and seized control of 90 percent of the urbanbattleground.   Syria is Iran's main Arab ally in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulfwar with Iraq. But Iran's drive, through Hezbollah, to dominateLebanon's 1.2 million Shiites has strained that alliance. TheSyrians consider Lebanon to be within their sphere of influence andvital to their security.   Amal spokesmen have complained publicly that delaying the Syriandeployment will only prolong the plight of thousands of civilianstrapped in the slums.   The Syrians, while seeking to avoid a confrontation with Iranover Lebanon, appear determined to send their troops into southBeirut, long a haven for Shiite kidnappers, hijackers and assassins.   ``There's no way to stop the fighting other than a Syrianmilitary deployment,'' Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's militaryintelligence chief in Lebanon, said in a statement broadcast Sundayby Beirut radio stations.   He did not set a specific deadline for deployment in thelabyrinthine slums. But he noted: ``By the time we deploy, I hopethere will be no hostages left in captivity.'' He did not elaborate.   Most of the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon are believed held byexteremists linked to Hezbollah. Syria has warned that ``any harmbefalling the hostages will be regarded as an aggressive actagainst Syria.''</TEXT></DOC>
