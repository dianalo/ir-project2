Bobby Godsell, head of industrial relations at Anglo American Corp., appealed yesterday for talks to resume and apparently dropped a previous demand by mine owners that only benefits, not cash wages, be discussed. There has been no discussion of wages since before the strike began.    Citing an increase in violence as the strike by black miners entered its third week, Mr. Godsell told a news conference in Johannesburg: &quot;We call on them {the NUM} to come back before more people die. From our position, we aren't setting conditions. We are saying let's come back and talk.&quot;    Mr. Godsell said the mine owners would defend their wage offer, but no longer would insist that it be a non-negotiable issue. &quot;Our stance is that the cash award is a fair one,&quot; he said. &quot;But we aren't setting conditions.&quot;    The main issue in the strike has been the union's demand for a 30% across-the-board wage increase. The six major mining houses, represented by the Chamber of Mines, implemented wage increases ranging up to 23% in July.    It was uncertain yesterday whether Anglo's appeal would satisfy the union's desire for wages to be the focus of future negotiations.    But NUM spokesman Kuben Pillay said the union sent a telex to the Chamber of Mines, suggesting &quot;arbitration, mediation or any other way to get out of this deadlock.&quot;    &quot;We have been told to expect a reply from the chamber very soon and talks could begin as soon as tomorrow,&quot; he said.    Meanwhile, Anglo American suspended a back-to-work deadline for several thousand strikers at its gold and coal mines in order &quot;to allow employees more time to consider their options.&quot; The company had threatened to fire the miners if they didn't return to work yesterday.    About 11,000 miners have been fired from three gold mines since the strike began and about 4,000 gold and coal miners have resumed work rather than risk dismissal.    &quot;We might begin to see wide-scale mass dismissals this week,&quot; NUM spokesman Marcel Golding said Sunday. &quot;But we think we can hold the strike together.&quot;    NUM plans to challenge the strike-related dismissals, even though they are allowed under South African labor law. &quot;We have not accepted that our members have been lawfully dismissed,&quot; said Cyril Ramaphosa, general secretary of the union. &quot;The actions . . . will be challenged.&quot;    Clashes over the weekend and yesterday left three miners dead and brought the toll since the strike began Aug. 9 to six killed and at least 350 wounded. The violence contributed to an increase in precious-metals prices yesterday.    In the latest strike-related violence, one miner died and at least 13 were injured early yesterday in a clash involving striking and non-striking miners and security forces at Anglo American's President Steyn gold mine.    In addition, Johannesburg Consolidated Investments officials said yesterday that two miners died Saturday and Sunday in clashes with non-striking miners and mine security forces at the Western Areas gold mine.    Anglo apparently is the hardest hit of the top mining companies. It has acknowledged losing substantial revenue because of the strike, but no mining company has provided figures on the costs of the strike.    The university-based Labor Monitoring Group, which does research on labor matters, has estimated that the strike already has cost the mining industry about $100 million in pretax earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
