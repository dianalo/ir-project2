(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The launch of space shuttle Discoveryand a five-man crew has been rescheduled for Feb. 23, five dayslater than planned.   The schedule change does not reflect any technical problem, onlythat extra time is needed to prepare Discovery for flight, LisaMalone, a NASA spokeswoman, said Wednesday.   However, she said that before a launching can occur engineersmust resolve tile and cracked bearing problems that developed duringthe December flight of the shuttle Atlantis. Officials have saidthey are confident the problems will be resolved in time to meet theFebruary launch date.   Atlantis suffered severe damage to nearly 200 of the 28,000thermal tiles that protect it from atmospheric re-entry heat. Andwhen engineers inspected the craft's main engines, they found a tinycrack in a bearing in a liquid hydrogen pump.   Officials believe the tile damage was caused when insulationpeeled away from the shuttle's external fuel tank and solid fuelbooster rockets during liftoff. They think the bearing damage may betraced to a flaw in the metal curing process.   The space agency said the current plan is to move Discovery intoan assembly building on Jan. 19 to be hooked to its fuel tank andbooster rockets, with rollout to the launch pad set for Jan. 26.   Agency managers will meet here Feb. 8 and 9 to assess thereadiness of the shuttle for flight. Liftoff on Feb. 23 is set for8:30 a.m. EST.   Navy Capt. Michael L. Coats will command Discovery on thefive-day mission, during which the astronauts will deploy acommunications satellite and conduct scientific and technologyexperiments. The other crew members are Air Force Col. John E.Blaha, Marine Cols. Robert C. Springer and James F. Buchli and JamesP. Bagian, a doctor.</TEXT></DOC>
