Asked when the agency might begin penalizing employers for knowingly hiring immigrants unauthorized to work in the U.S., he said, &quot;I don't think you're going to see anybody (fined) . . . until we make doggone sure we've educated them first.&quot;    Sanctions against employers are a crucial part of the new immigration law. The INS repeatedly has said that it intends to gradually phase in enforcement of the law, which subjects employers to civil fines -- and even jail terms for egregious violations -- for hiring illegal immigrants.    As passed in October, the law called for the INS to begin enforcing sanctions June 1, after a six-month education period. But in late May, after Congress began to examine problems in the INS's education effort, the agency said it wouldn't enforce the law in June.    Last week, House and Senate conferees agreed to a compromise on an amendment to a supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal 1987. That compromise delayed until Sept. 1 enforcement of a provision of the sanctions requiring employers to verify new workers' eligibility within three days. </TEXT></DOC>
