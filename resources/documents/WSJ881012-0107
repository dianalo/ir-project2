The suit, which Singer said was filed in federal court in Minneapolis, seeks more than $75 million in damages.    A spokeswoman at Northwest said she was unaware of the suit and that the company doesn't comment on litigation.    The complaint, Singer said, alleged that Northwest intentionally interfered with Singer's relations with French electronics concern Thomson-CSF, by threatening to bring Thomson into litigation pending between Northwest and Singer if Thomson purchased Singer's Link-Miles operation.    Northwest sued Singer for $25 million in May. Northwest's suit alleged that corporate raider Paul Bilzerian's post-takeover maneuvers at Singer slowed the delivery of flight simulators crucial to Northwest's Pacific route business. Mr. Bilzerian acquired the defense electronics concern earlier this year for $1.06 billion. The suit is pending in Minneapolis.    Singer said it didn't go through with the sale to Thomson, and will continue to operate the Link-Miles operation. </TEXT></DOC>
