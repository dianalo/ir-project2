FTC officials didn't identify purchasers who are targets of the investigation, or whether any investment houses face legal sanctions. But the move, disclosed in an unusual news release spelling out the existence of what was supposed to be a secret investigation by the commission's staff, indicates that the agency likely believes such violations are relatively frequent.    Jeffrey Zuckerman, director of the FTC's bureau of competition, said in an interview that the announcement was intended to serve as a warning that the agency intends to punish those who fail to comply with the reporting requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law.    Mr. Zuckerman said investment banks' clients could face &quot;substantial civil penalties&quot; for violating the reporting requirements. He added that &quot;the question of liability&quot; of the firms remains under review because it isn't clear how the law applies to them. Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino law, stock purchases that exceed certain thresholds are subject to federal antitrust review before the parties are allowed to acquire additional shares of a specific company.    The move isn't directly related to the Securities and Exchange Commission's stepped-up enforcement efforts against insider trading or the SEC's continuing investigation of arbitrager Ivan Boesky and some of his associates.    But Mr. Zuckerman made it clear that the commission hopes to build on those high-profile investigations to ensure that investors don't hide behind an investment banking firm to mask their intentions when acquiring large blocks of stock.    Despite private warnings by commission staff members about Hart-Scott-Rodino violations, Mr. Zuckerman said, there appears to be an increase in the number of suspect transactions aimed at skirting the law's pre-merger notification requirements.    The investigation involves several major investment banking firms that participated in hostile takeovers, agency officials said. The FTC said it is investigating several transactions in which investment banking firms acquired shares for clients, after the clients promised to either buy back the stock at a specific price in the future or to reimburse the firms if the stock were sold at a loss.    FTC officials said some clients are using such arrangements to claim that they are only acquiring options, and therefore aren't required to file details of their holdings under the law. The banking firms contend they are exempt from reporting requirements because the purchases are made solely for investment purposes.    But according to Mr. Zuckerman, &quot;The nature of the arrangements between the investment bankers and their clients makes it evident&quot; that the clients assume &quot;most of the risks and benefits of stock ownership.&quot;    In such circumstances, Mr. Zuckerman said, clients are required to file federal notification forms. The maximum penalty is a fine of $10,000 a day. </TEXT></DOC>
