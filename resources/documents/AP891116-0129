Company officials said they would sell ordinary Soviet womenAmerican-style cosmetics at American-sized prices, a tall challengein a nation where the average Soviet salary rarely tops $245 amonth.   A tube of lipstick can go for $15 in New York. A quarter ounceof the company's White Linen perfume can sell for $55.   Still, there was no shortage of curious customers on opening day.   The ceremony on Gorky Street in the center of Moscow, two blocksfrom the Kremlin, attracted dozens of passers-by who were keptbehind police barricades as Mrs. Lauder and Nanouli Shevardnadze,the wife of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, cut theribbon.   Well-dressed Soviet women later packed the shop, the latestcuriosity in a country that prides itself on its egalitarianprinciples.   Mrs. Lauder told the crowd gathered outside the store that thewomen of Moscow were already beautiful and ``we are going to keepevery woman beautiful.''   As an afterthought, she added, ``we are going to keep the menbeautiful, too,'' with sales of men's after shaves and colognes.   Company president Leonard Lauder said the company is selling itsproducts for dollars to the Moscow city council and the U.S.S.R.Ministry of Trade, which in turn are selling the cosmetics toSoviets for rubles.   The shop itself is owned and operated by the city council andthe ministry. The Soviet staff was trained by Estee Lauderpersonnel, he said.   He said Estee Lauder products have been available in Moscow forabout 10 years, but only in special shops for foreigners and jointventures accepting only hard currency.   ``We want to sell to ordinary Soviet people,'' Leonard Laudersaid. ``We will charge about what you would pay in New York.''   Mrs. Lauder also said the prices would be about the same.   For tourists, shopping at Estee Lauder will be a better deal. Atthe official rate, the ruble is worth $1.62, but under newregulations for tourists and other foreigners, the cost of a rubleis only 16 cents, which will make the Estee Lauder shop a bargainfor foreigners.   Thus, for an American tourist, eyeliner that costs 6 rublescould be purchased for the equivalent of 96 cents. Of course,that's if the foreigner wanted to brave the long line.   Mrs. Lauder said, ``every woman and every man can come to myshop. It doesn't cost much, cosmetics go a long way,'' she said.   The idea to open a shop for Soviet people came during a visit byRaisa Gorbachev, the wife of the Soviet president, to Mrs. Lauderin New York during a trip in 1988, Lauder officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
