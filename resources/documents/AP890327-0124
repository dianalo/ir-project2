The study examined 452 crimes reported from 1983 to 1987 andidentified by the Boston Police Community Disorders Unit asmotivated by bigotry.   The crimes included whites assaulting a white boyfriend of ablack female, bricks thrown through windows, a swastika painted ona synagogue and assaults on homosexuals.   Fifty-three percent of the crimes were categorized as physicalassaults, and 47 percent as property damage.   Howard J. Ehrlich, research director of the National InstituteAgainst Prejudice and Violence, an independent organization inBaltimore, called the Northeastern study ``the first really decentanalysis of hard data.'   Such research reinforces findings of the Baltimore institutethat one out of four or five minority persons will be victimizedduring the course of a year, he said.   ``It's very underreported,'' McDevitt said. ``Victims fearretaliation. And victims will deny it's a hate crime. If you feelyou're a victim because of your religion or your color, then eachtime you step out the door (you fear) you're going to be attacked.''   Among the findings:   _Sixty-three percent of the racial incidents were perpetrated bywhites, 33 percent by blacks. Four percent of such offenses werecommitted by people of Hispanic or Asian origin.   _The largest percentage of victims _ 35 percent _ were white,followed by blacks, 32 percent; Vietnamese, 12 percent, otherAsian, 11 percent; Hispanics, including Portuguese, 7 percent; andJews, 1 percent. Nearly one-third of the victims were female.   _In 30 percent of the cases, victims were told they were beingattacked because they ``did not belong'' in a neighborhood.   _64 percent of the racial attacks were committed by more thanone individual and most involved four or more people ganging upagainst a lone victim.   Ehrlich said it's estimated that up to 70 percent of suchcrimes, including verbal assaults, are never reported. But he saidsociety can work to get rid of bigotry.   ``Prejudice is learned. What confuses people is that, becauseit's learned so early, they believe it's innate or natural.Understanding that it's a learned attitude lets us understand thatwe can change attitudes,'' Erhlich said.</TEXT></DOC>
