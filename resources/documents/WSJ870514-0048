Shanahan, president and chief executive officer, said.    Mr. Shanahan said the St. Louis-based maker of military ground-support equipment expects to post net income of about 20 cents a share, down from an adjusted 29 cents a share in the fiscal 1986 first half.    The executive said that the company previously expected to report earnings of 30 cents a share for the latest half, but that delays in completing work on a major military contract had unexpectedly pushed back the receipt of payments. He said this contract involves the construction of a mobile pipeline system designed to be deployed rapidly to certain parts of the world for Army use to transport fuel into an area from as far as 250 miles away.    Mr. Shanahan said tests of the mobile pipeline showed the need for a number of modifications and improvements, delaying the receipt of about four months of revenue on the contract.    The delay also is expected to hurt Engineered Support's results for fiscal 1987 ending Oct. 31, Mr. Shanahan said. He said that while the company initially forecast a fiscal 1987 profit of $1.15 a share, it now expects earnings of closer to $1 a share. In fiscal 1986, the company earned 93 cents a share.    &quot;The delays won't affect the overall profit or revenue we will receive on the contract,&quot; Mr. Shanahan said. &quot;It is only pushing it back.&quot; He added that fiscal 1988 results now are expected to be better than the company initially forecast. He said the company's overall growth plans remain on track, with sales expected to exceed $80 million in fiscal 1987 and to surpass $100 million in fiscal 1988.    Mr. Shanahan said that while the pipeline contract contributed $30 million of revenue in fiscal 1986, it is only expected to add $15 million to $16 million in fiscal 1987 because of the delays.    He said that the company's backlog of orders stands at $80 million and that Engineered Support expects to book $60 million of additional contracts this fiscal year.    Mr. Shanahan said Engineered Support sees itself as a competitor in a $20 billion annual market for ground-support hardware and that it has identified specific contracts for which it can compete, with a first-year booking value of about $500 million. </TEXT></DOC>
