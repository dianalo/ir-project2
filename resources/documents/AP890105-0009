Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano said the rate of car thefts nationwidedropped from 6.6 per day in March to 1.5 per day in December.   He linked the plunge to a ``no-nonsense'' campaign in which about400 soldiers suspected of having links with car theft rings weredismissed.   ``We eased them out, and of course the crimes decreased becauseof this,'' Montano said in a television interview. ``And I know thatthis policy of ours is a very big deterrent for others who may beprone to commit this crime.''   He said that the rate of serious offenses _ such as murder, rapeand aggravated assault _ decreased from 17 incidents per 100,000people in 1987 to 14 per 100,000 last year.   However, total crime rate, including serious crimes, went up by1.2 percent from 1987 to 1988, Montano said. He gave no comparativefigures.   ``We in the Philippine Constabulary are happy because the crimerate was controllable last year,'' Montano said. He said more policewould help in their drive against criminals.   ``This, together with getting rid of our own misfits andscalawags, and increasing our crime solution efficiency, we hope(would) increase the deterrent effect of our laws.''</TEXT></DOC>
