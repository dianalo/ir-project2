Analysts had expected the price cuts because, under Federal Communications Commission rules, ATandamp;T passes along cost reductions resulting from lowered access charges it pays to local phone companies. Access charges for long-distance carriers are scheduled to be reduced July 1, when federally imposed access charges paid by residential and small-business customers will rise to $2.60 a month from $2. This is the FCC's method of trying to bring phone charges in line with costs.    ATandamp;T said its planned reductions of long-distance charges represent a 4.8% price cut on $12.3 billion of annual revenue expected from the services affected. According to a letter the company sent the FCC, ATandamp;T plans to cut by 4.8% the prices for direct-dialed long-distance, its &quot;800&quot; Readyline service for small businesses, and its Pro America and Reach Out America pricing plans for small businesses and residential customers.    ATandamp;T said it intends to file Friday a formal proposal asking for FCC approval of the plan. Analysts said the commission could require the company to cut rates further to reflect the lower taxes it is expected to pay under the new tax law. The company's current proposal only reflects lowered access costs.    US Sprint Communications Co., a joint venture between Stamford, Conn.-based GTE Corp. and Kansas City, Kan.-based United Telecommunications Inc., said it too will cut rates, but it couldn't say by how much. MCI Communications Corp. said it plans to cut rates but hasn't determined when or how much of its reductions in access costs will be reflected in lower prices.    Wendell Lind, an ATandamp;T division manager, network rates, said services targeted for rate cuts are those the company believes are used by customers most affected by the 60-cent-a-month increase in the access fee under the FCC plan.    Separately, ATandamp;T's computer business said it is offering a credit of $200 with the purchase of six personal computers from dealers from May 18 until Aug. 31. The credits are good toward purchases of more ATandamp;T computers or computer products such as local area networks and modems, the company said. Buyers would get credits of $100 with the purchase of one personal computer, the company said.    To spur sales, ATandamp;T recently cut prices of its PC 6300, PC 6300 Plus and PC 6310. The credits apply to those machines, as well as the company's unsuccessful Unix PC. </TEXT></DOC>
