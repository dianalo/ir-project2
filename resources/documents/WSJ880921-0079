The adviser, Stephen S. Fenichell, was named Monday in a civil lawsuit filed by the SEC in New York. U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa granted the SEC's request for an order freezing Mr. Fenichell's assets and directing him to turn over records of his accounts.    The lawsuit identified eight individuals who had invested money with Mr. Fenichell beginning in November 1974 and who have recouped little or none of their investments. Mr. Fenichell couldn't be reached for comment.    Judge Griesa scheduled a hearing for Sept. 29 on the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction. </TEXT></DOC>
