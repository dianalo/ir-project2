The maker of medical equipment said the MT/P system will cost about $800,000, which it said is &quot;one-third to one-half&quot; the price of other models. The new machines take longer to process an image, noted a spokeswoman, and the images, while fine for making diagnoses, &quot;aren't as aesthetically beautiful&quot; as those of Diasonics' higher-cost models.    She said the company expects the new model to &quot;expand the market,&quot; rather than cannibalize sales of conventional models. The South San Francisco, Calif., company declined to project sales for the new model. In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Diasonics shares closed unchanged at $2.875. </TEXT></DOC>
