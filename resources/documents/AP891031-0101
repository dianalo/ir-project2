KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the time it takes to light a flag, thecourts have their first cases to test a new law outlawing theburning of Old Glory.   Gregory Johnson, the protester whose 1984 flag burning led theSupreme Court to legalize the act, was arrested with three otherpeople Monday as they ripped and burned American flags on the stepsof the Capitol.   Capitol policemen tore pieces of a shredded flag from the handsof one demonstrator who lit the first flag.   The other protesters unfurled flags and set them afire as allfour chanted, ``burn baby burn'' before policemen aimed fireextinguishers at the burning remnants, bathing the scene in whitesmoke.   They invited the arrest to protest the Flag Protection Act of1989, the statute that took effect only Saturday. The protesterswere charged with violating the new statute, demonstrating withouta permit and disorderly conduct.   They were transferred to the custody of city police and wereheld in jail pending arraignment on the charges today.   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas told the Senatetoday that the ``outrage'' of a flag burning on the Capitol stepsgives the Supreme Court a chance to ``redeem itself from lastJune's blunder.''   ``I hope that Gregory Johnson is convicted and that _ this time_ his conviction is upheld by the Supreme Court,'' Dole said. ``AndI hope that the Flag Protection Act of 1989 does not become `theflag-burners protection act after all the smoke has cleared.'''   But Dole said he continues to believe that the law is ``nothingmore than legal hocus pocus _ that it is grossly overbroad andprobably unconstitutional.'' And he said he remains convinced thatthe real answer to ``the flag-burning problem is a constitutionalamendment.''   On Monday, Nancy Kent, speaking for the group, made clear theyintended to test the law Congress passed following the SupremeCourt decision last June that flag burning as a political protestis protected speech under the First Amendment to the Constitution.   ``We challenge you,'' Miss Kent said, reading a preparedstatement. ``Arrest us. Test your statute. Take it back to theSupreme Court and try once again to claim it is all consistent withyour constitutional standards of free speech.''   Also on Monday, the 1984 charge against Johnson was officiallydismissed in Texas by Dallas County Criminal Judge John Hendrik.The dismissal came five months after the Supreme Court rulingoverturning his conviction.   Hendrik called the dismissal ``the most distasteful duty of mynine-year judicial career'' and said he did it ``only because of myoath.''   And in Seattle on Monday, FBI agents watched as about a dozenUniversity of Washington students burned U.S. flags to protest thenew federal law. No arrests were made.   David Cole, who said he represents Johnson as a staff attorneyfor the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York City, said heand his client believe the new law is just as unconstitutional asthe statute it replaced.   Capitol police identified the four persons arrested as Johnson,33, of Richmond, Ind.; Shawn Eichner, 24, of New York City; DavidBlalock, 39, of Johnstown, Pennsylvania; and Scott ``Dread Scott''Tyler, 24, of Chicago.   Miss Kent said Blalock is a member of the Vietnam VeteransAgainst the War; Eichman represents Coalition Opposed to Censorshipin the Arts; and Johnson is a member of the Revolutionary CommunistYouth Brigade.   Tyler stirred criticism in Chicago earlier this year by placinga flag on the floor as part of a student exhibit at the School ofthe Art Institute. The display asked viewers to describe the properway to display the flag and included a register that was placed sowriters had to stand on the flag to record their opinions.   The flag law, which President Bush allowed to take force withouthis signature, sparked a series of protest flag burnings in citiesacross the country over the weekend.   It provides punishment of up to one year in jail and a fine foranyone who ``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles,burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flagof the United States.''   Bush questioned whether the new law meets constitutional testsand favors a constitutional amendment to ban desecration of theflag.</TEXT></DOC>
