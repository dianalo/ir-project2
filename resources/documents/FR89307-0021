Authority   </ITAG>These regulations are issued under the authority of sections 2002(a), 3004,3005, and 3006 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended,42 U.S.C. 6912(a), 6924, 6925, and 6926.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) createsa ``cradle-to-grave'' management system intended to ensure that hazardouswaste is identified and properly transported, stored, treated, and disposed.Subtitle C requires EPA to identify hazardous waste and to promulgate standardsfor generators and transporters of such wastes. Under section 3004 of RCRA,owners and operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities arerequired to comply with standards ``necessary to protect human health andthe environment.'' These standards are generally implemented initiallythrough interim status standards and later through permits that are issuedunder authorized State programs or by EPA.Under section 3005(a) of RCRA, all treatment, storage, and disposal ofhazardous waste are prohibited, except in accordance with a permit thatimplements the section 3004 standards. However, recognizing that the issuanceof permits can be time consuming, Congress created ``interim status'' forfacilities in existance on the effective date of EPA's permitting regulations(November 19, 1980). Under section 3005(e), owners and operators of hazardouswaste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities in existance on thatdate who submitted a Part A permit application and a section 3010 notificationare treated as having been issued permits until an authorized State orEPA takes final administrative action on their permit applications.On August 14, 1987, the Agency proposed amendments to its regulations regardingchanges at interim status facilities, procedures on post-closing permitting,and permit modifications. On November 17, 1988 the Agency issued a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice soliciting public comment on the needto further amend its regulations on permit modification procedures. Thoseproposed amendments are discussed below.  A. Changes at Interim Status Facilities  An interim status facility generally may change its waste management operationswithout notification or prior Agency approval, except for changes specificallyidentified at 40 CFR 270.72. Under previous regulations, these changeswere: (1) The handling of wastes not previously identified in Part A ofthe permit application; (2) increase in design capacity of processes wherethere is a lack of available capacity at other waste management facilities;(3) changes in or addition of processes if necessary to protect human healthand the environment or to comply with Federal regulations or State or locallaws; and (4) changes in ownership or operational control of a facility.Section 270.72 specifies procedures and criteria for each of these changes.Prior approval by the Director is required before facilities can increasedesign capacity, add or make changes in processes, or change ownershipunder andSection;270.72. Prior to today's rule, the reconstruction limit(the former andSection;270.72(c)) prohibited any of the above changes toan interim status facility that required a capital expenditure equalingor exceeding 50 percent of the cost of constructing a comparable new hazardouswaste management facility, except for changes necessary to comply withthe recently promulgated tank standards (51 FR 25422, July 14, 1986) andcertain changes to treat or store in tanks or containers hazardous wastessubject to land disposal restrictions (52 FR 25760, July 8, 1987).  EPA believes that these regulations may in some cases unnecessarily restrictinterim status facilities' flexibility, particularly in complying withnew regulatory requirements. The consequences include a potential delayfor some facilities in complying with new requirements and, in some cases,increased risk to human health and the environment. In fact, some interimstatus facilities may have no means to operate in compliance with the RCRAregulations while EPA or an authorized State reviewed their applicationfor a RCRA permit. To avoid these undesirable results, the Agency proposedseveral regulatory changes on August 14, 1987 (52 FR 30570) to increaseflexibility for owners and operators of interim status facilities to makechanges necessary to comply with Federal, State, or local regulatory requirements.Today's notice promulgates this proposal as a final rule.  B. Post-Closure Permitting  The permitting regulations specify that RCRA permits cover both the activelife (including the closure period) of a facility and, where applicable,the post-closure care period.  A permit applicant required to obtain an operating permit must includeall necessary post-closure information in its Part B permit applicationfor the application to be ``complete'' and thus initiate the review process.When the application is complete, EPA's decision to issue a permit appliesto the whole permit, including the portion of the permit concerning post-closurecare. In practice, however, EPA has found it necessary to separate thedecision to deny a permit to operate a unit from the decision to issuea permit covering post-closure conditions. As the August 14, 1987 proposalstated, this practice has been necessary to ensure prompt closure of facilitiesthat fail to meet the regulatory standards. The former regulations, however,did not specifically provide for a separation of the permit decision forthe active life of the facility from post-closure permit decision.  In the August 14, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, the Agency proposed to amend its permittingregulations to clarify its authority to deny permits for the active life(including the closure period) of a facility while a permit decision withrespect to the post-closure period remains pending.  C. Permit Modifications  <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Newly Listed or Identified Wastes  </ITAG>Whenever EPA lists a new hazardous waste or identifies a new hazardouscharacteristic, facilities handling that waste must come into compliancewith Subtitle C requirements. Unpermitted facilities may continue to handlethe waste without Agency approval if they comply with interim status requirementsin Part 265 and they submit to EPA a Part A application and a section 3010notice. Permitted facilities, however, were required to secure a permitmodification incorporating the newly listed or identified waste beforethe effective date of the new listing or identification. Under previousregulations, such a change required a ``major'' permit modification. Themajor modification procedures of the former andSection;270.41 included thefull administrative procedures that apply to issuance of a permit; theonly significant difference was that, for a major modification, only thoseconditions of the permit to be modified were reopened.   Because of concerns over inequitable treatment of permitted versus interimstatus facilities, EPA proposed in the August 14 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice to allow newly listed or identified wastes,and the units handling such wastes, to be added to permits as minor permitmodifications if the facility owner or operator requested a major modificationwithin 180 days.  Today's rule, however, does not finalize this proposal because the Agencyhas already addressed this problem as part of the recent amendments tothe permit modification regulations (53 FR 37912, September 28, 1988).Comments received on the August 14 proposal for today's rule were addressedin the September 28 final permit modification rule. As a result of thepermit modification rule, permitted facilities can now more easily modifypermits to allow for handling of newly listed or identified wastes in amanner more consistent with interim status facilities.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Land Disposal Restrictions</ITAG>The permit modification regulations that EPA published on September 28,1988 (53 FR 37912) established a new three-tiered system of permit modifications.In that rule, specific facility changes were classified as either Class1, 2, or 3 modifications. This rule did not specifically address changesnecessary to comply with the land disposal restrictions. However, in thecourse of developing land disposal restrictions for the First Third scheduledwastes (53 FR 31138, August 17, 1988) and the California list wastes (52FR 25760, July 8, 1987), EPA received several comments on the need to provideincreased flexibility for permitted facilities that need to make changesto comply with these requirements. Therefore, on November 17, 1988 (53FR 46474), the Agency reopened the comment period on the facility changesrulemaking to solicit comment on whether certain facility changes stemmingfrom the land disposal restrictions program should be Class 1 permit modifications.The permit modifications addressed in the November 17 <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice are similar to two previous minor modificationsthat were superseded by the new permit modification procedures adoptedon September 28, 1988. Former andSection;270.42(o) allowed facilities toadd new waste codes to their permits if the wastes were restricted underPart 268, met the applicable treatment standards, and were not substantiallydifferent from currently handled wastes. Similarly, andSection;270.42(p)allowed the addition of new treatment processes used to treat restrictedwastes to Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT) levels as longas those processes took place in tanks and containers and the facilityrequested a major permit modification. (<T3>See </T3>52 FR 25760, July 8, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Section by Section Analysis</ITAG>A. SummaryToday's rule generally adopts the provisions of the proposed rule of August14, 1987 related to changes at interim status and permitted facilitiesand post-closure permitting. It provides greater flexibility to interimstatus facilities to: (1) Increase design capacity, if approved by theDirector as necessary to comply with Federal, State, or local requirements,and (2) make changes specified in section 3008(h) corrective action ordersor similar orders issued by State or local authorities or by a court. Italso lifts the ``reconstruction'' limit for: (1) Changes to certain unitsso long as they are necessary to comply with Federal, State, or local requirements;(2) changes necessary to allow continued handling of newly listed or identifiedhazardous wastes; (3) changes made in accordance with an approved closureplan; and (4) changes made pursuant to a corrective action order. In addition,it promulgates the proposed clarification that EPA can deny permits forthe active life of a facility while a decision on post-closure permittingis pending.As part of today's changes to andSection;270.72, the Agency also reorganizedthat entire section. Under the new organization, paragraph (a) lists thechanges that are regulated under andSection;270.72 and paragraph (b) containsall provisions related to the reconstruction limit. Note that a requirementthat new land disposal units at interim status facilities certify compliancewith groundwater and financial responsibility requirements within a yearwas proposed in andSection;270.72(c) but is promulgated today at andSection;270.73(e)in this final rule. The following chart cross references the former andSection;270.72with today's rule.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,xs28 </C><T4>Relationship of Today's Rule to the Former Section </T4>270.72<H1>Previous citation</H1><H1>Today's rule</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">(a)<D>(a)(1)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(b)<D>(a)(2)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(c)<D>(a)(3)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(d)<D>(a)(4)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(e)<D>(b)</D></ITAG></ITAG>It should also be noted that the Agency made a minor clarification to thesection now designated as andSection;270.72(a)(1). That section providesthat an interim status facility may continue to handle a newly listed oridentified waste not previously identified in the Part A permit applicationif the owner or operator submits a revised Part A. The Agency has addedlanguage in today's rule to remove any possible ambiguity that the unitcurrently handling the newly listed or identified waste may be added underthat provision as well. Thus, when EPA lists or identifies a new waste,the facility may continue to handle the waste in the same unit withoutobtaining prior Director approval. This situation for interim status facilitiesis analogous to that of unpermitted and permitted facilities handling newlyidentified wastes, both of which can make this change without prior Directorapproval.Because today's rule has no substantive effect on former andSection;270.72(a)(now andSection;270.72(a)(1)) and andSection;270.72(d) (now andSection;270.72(a)(4))the Agency did not address public comments related to those sections inthis notice. Although only portions of andSection;270.72 are being amendedby today's rule, it is printed in its entirety for the convenience of thereader.Today's publication of andSection;270.72(b) also serves to correct a technicalerror created by a final rule published on July 8, 1987 (52 FR 25760).In another final rule published on July 14, 1986, the Agency amended theformer andSection;270.72(e) to eliminate the reconstruction limit for changesmade solely to comply with the requirements of andSection;265.193 for tanksand ancillary equipment. In the July 8, 1987 rule, the Agency again amendedthe former andSection;270.72(e) to lift the reconstruction limit for certainchanges at interim status facilities made to implement the land disposalrestrictions and, at the same time, inadvertently omitted the July 14,1986 amendment. Today's publication of andSection;270.72(b) incorporatesall amendments to the reconstruction limit to date; the amendment relatedto tanks and ancillary equipment is found in andSection;270.72(b)(1) andthe land disposal restriction amendment is found in andSection;270.72(b)(6).In addition to adopting the interim status and post-closure permittingprovisions of the proposed rule, today's rule also modifies the regulationsat andSection;270.42 to reclassify as Class 1 certain permit modificationsnecessary to enable facilities to comply with the land disposal restrictions.Specifically, it allows owners and operators of permitted facilities toadd new waste codes, or a narrative description, to a permit as Class 1modifications where the added wastes are: (1) Restricted wastes that havebeen treated to meet the applicable Part 268 treatment standard, or (2)residues from treating so called ``soft hammer'' wastes, and (3) certainwastewater treatment residues and incinerator ash. The rule also allowsas a Class 1 modification, without prior approval, the addition of newwastes for treatment in tanks or containers under certain limited conditions.Finally the rule allows as a Class 1 modification, with prior Directorapproval, the addition of new treatment processes, as long as those processesare necessary to treat restricted wastes to meet treatment standards andthe treatment processes are to take place in tanks or containers. B. Changes at Interim Status Facilities <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Increases in Design Capacity </ITAG>Today's rule (andSection;270.72(a)(2)) allows owners and operators to increasedesign capacity of processes at a facility when the Director approves thechange as necessary to comply with Federal, State, or local requirements.This new provision expands the reasons for allowing capacity increases;the former andSection;270.72(b) allowed owners and operators to increasedesign capacity only if the Director approved the change because of a demonstratedlack of available capacity at other waste management facilities. This change will allow interim status facilities to comply with new requirements,including those imposed by HSWA, and will, therefore, provide increasedpublic and environmental protection. In the preamble to the proposal ofthis rule, the Agency set forth several examples to demonstrate this point.(<T3>See </T3>52 FR 30570 at 30573). No comments were submitted in oppositionto this amendment. For these reasons, the Agency is adopting the proposedandSection;270.72(a)(2)(i) to allow increases in design capacity necessaryto comply with new requirements. Several commenters, however, requested that the Agency clarify whether``increases in design capacity of processes'' could include the additionof new units at a facility. Section 270.72(a)(2) does allow the Directorto approve addition of new units at a facility to increase the capacityof a process already in operation at the facility. It should be noted,however, that addition of a unit of a type not already present at the facilitywould be considered a change in process rather than an increase in designcapacity, and therefore would fall under andSection;270.72(a)(3). (<T3>See </T3>section III.B.2 of this preamble). Another commenter argued that andSection;270.72(a)(2)(i), which allows theDirector to approve an increase in design capacity because there is a lackof available capacity elsewhere, frustrates implementation of the minimumtechnology requirements of section 3004(o) by requiring a finding of lackof available capacity before increases in design capacity can be made.EPA believes that the new andSection;270.72(a)(2)(ii) addresses this commenter'sconcern. As explained above, EPA or a State Director may approve an increasein design capacity under this section if the change is necessary to complywith Federal, State, or local requirements, regardless of whether or notother capacity is available. The preamble to the proposal specificallyreferences the facility changes necessary to comply with section 3004(o)as being the type of Federally mandated requirement that would qualifyas an appropriate reason for EPA or a State to approve an interim statuschange. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Changes in or Addition of Processes </ITAG>Under the former andSection;270.72(c), owners and operators could make changesin or add processes at a facility if the Director approved the change asnecessary either to protect human health and the environment in an emergencyor to comply with Federal regulations or State or local laws. The correspondingprovision in today's rule, andSection;270.72(a)(3), has been amended to clarifythat ``Federal regulations or State or local laws'' encompasses all Federal,State, and local requirements. This includes regulations, orders, statutes,and permit-related requirements such as approved closure plans. EPA receivedno comments opposing this clarifying amendment. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Corrective Action </ITAG>Section 3008(h) authorizes the Agency to order a facility owner or operatorto conduct corrective action during interim status when the Agency determinesthat there is or has been a release of hazardous waste into the environment.Section 270.72(a)(5) promulgated today allows interim status facilitiesto make changes in accordance with corrective action orders issued by theAgency under section 3008(h) or other Federal authority (or orders issuedby a Director under an equivalent State authority). In today's rule, theAgency has modified the language proposed in andSection;270.72(a)(5) to clarifythat when the Agency or a State seeks corrective action through judicialproceedings and a court, rather than the Agency or State, issues an orderrequiring corrective action, changes made in accordance with such an orderwould also be permissible changes under andSection;270.72(a)(5). In addition to the new andSection; 270.72(a)(5), today's rule also promulgatesandSection; 270.72(b)(5), which removes the reconstruction limit for changesmade in accordance with such corrective action orders. Under the new andSection; 270.72(a)(5), facility changes introduced in accordancewith corrective action orders restricted to activities involving wastesassociated with the facility. This limitation does not prevent treatment,storage, or disposal of wastes released from within the facility that migratedbeyond the facility's boundaries. Rather the limitation prevents the owneror operator from making changes under this authority to manage wastes andmaterials that have no relationship to the facility. The limitation forunrelated materials is necessary to prevent the owner or operator seekingto manage such materials from evading the permit requirement for new facilitiesand change in interim status requirements for facility modifications. Some commenters expressed concern that the new andSection; 270.72(a)(5) limitschanges permissible for purposes of corrective action to those made inaccordance with a corrective action order. The commenters argued that theprovision should be expanded to allow changes necessary for voluntary correctiveaction to be made as well and that the reconstruction limit should notapply to voluntary corrective action measures. The commenters noted thatcorrective action done early can decrease the cost of clean-up and provideincreased protection of human health and the environment. The Agency, however,limited the changes permissible under new andSection; 270.72(a)(5) to thosemade in compliance with a corrective action order because voluntary correctiveaction would not typically involve EPA or State oversight or public notice.By requiring that the changes made under paragraph (a)(5) be made in accordancewith a corrective action order, the Agency has assured that those changeswill be subject to Agency review and, additionally, to public comment.Therefore, the Agency has not made the modification to andSection; 270.72(a)(5)that the commenter suggested. The Agency, nevertheless, believes that the regulations already providesignificant flexibility for voluntary corrective action at interim statusfacilities. Section 270.72(a) (2) and (3) allow the Director to approveincreases in design capacity or the addition of new processes, if necessaryto comply with Federal, State, or local requirements. This would includechanges made as part of voluntary corrective action taken in anticipationof a section 3008(h) order or section 3004(u) permit conditions. Thesechanges, however, would be subject to Director approval and would be limitedby the reconstruction cap of andSection; 270.72(b).\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Agency addressed this general issue in the preambleto the proposed Mobile Treatment Unit (MTU) regulation (52 FR 20914 to20930, June 3, 1987). In that preamble, the Agency explained that MTU'smay be allowed to operate at interim status facilities as a change necessaryto comply with Federal, State, or local requirements. The Agency then wentfurther to say that the use of an MTU for studies at an interim statusfacility to determine whether a specific treatment could meet BDAT in accordancewith the land disposal restrictions, or to select a remedial measure inanticipation of Agency action under sections 3008(h) or 3004(u) would likelyqualify as an acceptable change in interim status.Sections 270.72(a) (2) and (3) and 270.72(a)(5), therefore, impose somewhatdifferent requirements on different types of corrective action. Where EPAor a State has required specific corrective action as part of a section3008(h) or similar order, or a court has ordered correction action, approvalof that action as a change in interim status is not necessary, and thereconstruction limit does not apply (andSection; 270.72 (a)(5) and (b)(5)).On the other hand, where the action is not explicitly required in an order,or it is taken merely in anticipation of an order, Director approval isrequired and the reconstruction limit potentially applies (andSection; 270.72(a)(2) and (3)). <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Loss of Interim Status </ITAG>In some cases, new land disposal units may be added to a facility as achange in interim status. For example, a surface impoundment handling nonhazardouswaste at an interim status facility might be brought into the system ifEPA subsequently listed the waste as hazardous. In this case, andSection;270.73(e) of today's rule (proposed as andSection; 270.72(c) but moved inthe final rule to andSection; 270.73 for purposes of clarity) would requirethe facility to certify, 12 months after the effective date of the listing,that the unit was in compliance with all applicable ground-water monitoringand financial responsibility requirements. EPA added this requirement toensure comparable treatment of land disposal units containing newly identifiedhazardous wastes at permitted, unpermitted, and interim status facilities.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Other Issues </ITAG>One commenter argued that the Agency should have the authority to approveany change in interim status that would improve environmental quality,decrease costs, or improve safety or efficiency. Another commenter arguedthat the Agency should allow changes made to: (1) Protect human healthand the environment, (2) avoid disrupting ongoing waste management, and(3) enable the permittee to respond to sudden changes in the types or quantitiesof wastes being managed at the facility. The agency believes that the criteriasuggested by these commenters are too broad. In adopting its regulationfor interim status facilities, the Agency chose an approach it believedwould allow reasonable modification to existing facilities without nullifyingthe requirements for obtaining a RCRA permit. (See 45 FR 33290 at 33324,May 19, 1980). As part of its approach, the Agency allowed increases indesign capacity and addition of or changes in existing processes at interimstatus facilities only for specified reasons, and made those changes subjectto Agency approval and to the reconstruction limit. The Agency continuesto follow this approach in its regulations at andSection; 270.72. EPA believesthat the criteria suggested by the commenter might result in expansionsat interim status facilities that require full public participation andother protections of the permitting process.C. Reconstruction Limit <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General </ITAG>The former andSection; 270.72(e) prohibited changes to an interim statusfacility that required a capital expenditure equalling or exceeding 50percent of the cost of constructing a comparable new hazardous waste managementfacility. This ``reconstruction limit'' was designed to prevent facilitiesfrom circumventing permitting requirements by expanding significantly duringinterim status. This limitation was amended in EPA's new tank standards,issued on July 14, 1986 (51 FR 25422), which eliminated the reconstructionlimit for changes made solely for the purposes of complying with the tankstandards on andSection; 265.193. It was further amended in a final ruleissued on July 8, 1987 (52 FR 25760), which eliminated the reconstructionlimit for changes made to treat or store, in tanks or containers, wastessubject to land disposal restrictions when the changes were made solelyto comply with land disposal restrictions. The Agency believes, however,that there are additional changes that should be allowed at interim statusfacilities even when they amount to a reconstruction. The need for thesechanges is more compelling than the need to limit interim status facilityexpansion. To allow those changes, today's rule eliminates the reconstruction limitfor changes in interim status that EPA or the State Director determinesto be necessary: (1) To comply with Federal, State, or local requirements,if the changes take place solely in existing units; in new tanks or containers;or in replacement surface impoundments that meet the minimum technologyrequirements of section 3004(o); or (2) to allow the owner or operatorto continue to handle newly listed or identified hazardous wastes. It alsoamends the reconstruction limit to specify that it does not apply to correctiveactions required by EPA or by States under authorized RCRA programs, orordered by a court. Finally, it amends the reconstruction limit so thatit does not apply during closure of a facility or of a unit within a facilitythat is done pursuant to an approved closure plan. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Federal, State, and Local Requirements </ITAG>Section 270.72(b)(2) of today's rule lifts the reconstruction limit forchanges to existing units, changes solely involving tanks or containers,and changes involving the addition of replacement surface impoundmentsmeeting minimum technology requirements, if those changes are necessaryto comply with Federal, State, or local requirements. As explained in thepreamble to the August 14 proposal, this amendment will allow more expeditiouscompliance with new requirements, therefore improving protection of humanhealth and the environment. Several commenters argued that the scope of andSection; 270.72(b)(2) wastoo narrow. For example, some commenters suggested that the reconstructionlimit be lifted for any new or replacement landfill or surface impoundment,and for any lateral expansions to these units, as long as the units werein compliance with minimum technology requirements. Commenters also arguedthat limitations to the reconstruction cap will prevent facilities frommaking all changes necessary to comply with Federal, State, or local requirements.Commenters argued that some rules, such as the land disposal restrictions,mandate incineration as the treatment standard for some wastes and thatthe reconstruction limit stands in the way of incinerators being addedto a facility to allow the facility to comply with these requirements.Another argued that a facility should be able to follow the requirementsfor interim status landfills and surface impoundments in RCRA section 3015(b)and not be blocked by the reconstruction limit. EPA disagrees with these comments and has finalized the rule as proposed.As the Agency stated in the preamble to the proposal, major new landfillsand incinerators (i.e., those that would exceed the 50% reconstructionlimit) require the close Agency oversight and approval afforded by thepermit process. In addition, the permit process provides an opportunityfor public participation, including an opportunity for comment and a hearing.Public comments on other rulemakings_such as the recent amendments to thepermit modification procedures_and the intent of Congress as illustratedby HSWA, which stressed, for example, concerns about land disposal, makeit clear that major new land disposal units and incinerators are inappropriateat interim status facilities, without the protections provided by the permittingprocess. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Newly Listed or Identified Wastes </ITAG>Section 270.72(b)(3) of today's rule lifts the reconstruction limit forchanges that are necessary to allow owners or operators to continue handlingnewly listed or identified wastes that had been treated, stored, or disposedof at the facility prior to the effective date of the rule establishingthe new listing or identification. This provision has been slightly modified from the proposal. The proposalrestricted acceptable changes to those taking place at facilities thathad handled the newly listed or identified waste prior to the date of the<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice establishing the new listing or identification.Today's rule allows the changes if the facility had handled the waste beforethe effective date of the rule. EPA made this change in response to commenters, who pointed out an inconsistencybetween the proposal's treatment of interim status facilities and the statute'streatment of unpermitted facilities. Under section 3005(e)(A)(ii) of RCRA,facilities handling newly listed or identified wastes may obtain interimstatus if they were in existence on the effective date of the regulationlisting or identifying the waste. EPA does not believe there is any reasonto treat interim status facilities and facilities outside the permittinguniverse differently in this case. Therefore, it has modified the proposedlanguage, so that the trigger date for defining whether a facility is eligibleis the effective date of the new listing or identification, not the dateof the rule's publication. Note that EPA made a similar change with respectto management of newly listed and identified wastes at permitted facilitiesin its recent amendments to the permit modification procedures. (<T3>See </T3>53 FR 37912, September 28, 1988).One commenter argued that the reconstruction limit should be lifted forchanges necessary to handle newly listed or identified wastes, whetheror not previously handled at the facility, when the process necessary tohandle the newly listed or identified waste was similar to processes alreadyat the facility. The commenter argued that the restriction to wastes previouslyhandled at the facility is unfounded, particularly if the treatment requiredfor handling the new waste is similar to treatment already used at thefacility. EPA disagrees with this comment. The purpose of andSection; 270.72(b)(3)in the August 14 proposal was to prevent disruptions in existing operationsat interim status facilities, not to allow facilities to expand their activitiessignificantly without meeting permitting requirements. In doing so, itput interim status facilities on an equal footing with unpermitted facilities.Therefore, EPA has not adopted the commenter's suggestion in today's rule.The Agency, however, believes that in most cases the flexibility requestedby the commenter is already provided in other parts of andSection; 270.72.In particular, facility changes to handle newly identified wastes, wherethe unit process is similar to processes already at the facility, are unlikelyto exceed the reconstruction limit. If such a change does not exceed thereconstruction limit, it can be made as a change in interim status, aslong as it was approved as necessary to comply with Federal, State, orlocal requirements. Furthermore, such a change that involves storage ortreatment solely in tanks or containers might be allowed as a change ininterim status, even if the change exceeded the reconstruction limit. (SeeandSection; 270.72(b)(2)). <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Changes During Closure </ITAG>Under andSection; 270.72(b)(4) of today's rule, changes made at an interimstatus facility during closure in accordance with an approved closure planare not subject to the reconstruction limit. For example, if an approvedclosure plan calls for the use of a new tank unit at a facility to treatwaste before final disposal, that unit could be brought on to the facility,with Director approval, as a change in interim status. Similarly, if anapproved closure plan required on-site incineration, an incinerator maybe brought on to the facility as a change in interim status. However, inboth cases, the unit could be used to handle only the wastes associatedwith closure. EPA stresses that the closure plan approval process provides for Agencyreview and an opportunity for public comment analogous to that providedby the permit process. For example, in approving a closure plan, EPA oran authorized State would ensure that any new units brought on to the facilityunder a change in interim status met all applicable Part 265 operatingand closure standards. Additional conditions might be required where necessaryto ensure that the overall closure activity meets the closure performancestandard at andSection; 265.111. In the case of an incinerator, this wouldmean compliance with the trial burn requirements, the operating standards,and other requirements found in Part 264, depending on the site-specificcircumstances. In addition, the closure regulations require public noticeand an opportunity for comment, just as do the permitting regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Corrective Action </ITAG>As explained in section III.B.3 of this preamble, andSection; 270.72(b)(5)removes the reconstruction limit for changes necessary to comply with correctiveaction orders, provided that such changes will be limited to treatment,storage, or disposal of solid waste from releases that originate withinthe boundary of the facility. This amendment will ensure prompter implementationof corrective action orders, while the section 3008(h) procedures willensure public participation equivalent to permitting. For more discussion,see section III.B.3 of the preamble. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Other Issues </ITAG>One commenter stated that the reconstruction limit is unsound and unwarranted.The commenter pointed out that EPA controls when to call in Part B permitapplications and that new units are subject to new technology requirements.Citing the Agency's justification for the reconstruction limit in the preambleto the proposed rule, the commenter argued that if, as the Agency alleged,the purpose of the reconstruction limit is to prevent facilities from expandingduring interim status, thereby evading the permitting process, the Agencyshould explicitly identify the means by which facilities do this and onlythose methods should be limited by the reconstruction limit. The commenternoted that there is no statutory reference to the reconstruction limit.The Agency disagrees with this comment. Congress' purpose in establishing``interim status'' was to ensure that facilities already in the businessof managing hazardous waste were not unduly disrupted by RCRA's new permittingrequirements. Interim status provides a mechanism to allow these facilitiesto continue in operation pending permit review and issuance. In developing regulations to implement this requirement, EPA recognizedthat interim status facilities would require some flexibility to maintainoperations. Section 270.72 provides that flexibility. However, EPA placeda cap on changes in interim status in the ``reconstruction limit,'' toensure that interim status facilities could not avoid permitting requirementsfor major new expansions of activities. Thus, the Agency struck the balancebetween undue disruption of current facility operations (the goal of interimstatus in the first instance) and the direction of Congress to move facilitiesinto the permitting universe. This provision is described more fully inthe preamble to EPA's interim status regulations (45 FR 33290 at 33324,May 19, 1980). The August 14 proposal and today's rule do not change the basic requirementsof the reconstruction limit. Instead, the purpose of the proposal was toidentify specific areas where the reconstruction limit was not necessaryor approrpriate. The commenter suggested that, instead of establishingthe reconstruction limit as an across-the-board requirement and identifyingexceptions, EPA should merely identify those activities where the limitapplies. The Agency disagrees. Given the wide range of changes that mighttake place at an interim status facility, it would be impossible to identifyall those that were ``permit-like'' or that required permit-level publicparticipation. Therefore, the Agency has not adopted this approach, andcontinues to believe that the reconstruction limit should be lifted onlyin specific, clearly identified circumstances such as those identifiedin today's rule. Another commenter suggested that EPA remove the reconstruction limit forany improvements to a facility that would provide increased protectionof human health and the environment. EPA has rejected this standard asoverly broad and vague. While the Agency does not wish to delay such changesunduly, it believes that, read broadly, this standard could allow almostany change at a facility, including the construction of a major new landfillor an incinerator. These are the kinds of changes that should undergo permittingand full public participation, regardless of whether they arguably increasedhealth and environmental protection.Another commenter suggested that the reconstruction limit (and more broadlyandSection;270.72) prohibited a wide range of necessary or beneficial changesnot identified in today's regulation. The commenter specifically referredto a storage facility that it claimed was unable to curb and pave an unpavedsurface on which palletized drums were stored because the cost of thisactivity would exceed the reconstruction limit. The commenter in this case,however, has misunderstood the reconstruction limit. This limit appliesonly to facility changes that are regulated under andSection;270.72. If achange (for example, a new roof over a container storage area or the pavingof a storage area) is not identified under andSection;270.72(a), and doesnot otherwise require a RCRA permit, it does not need Director approvalbefore it can be made.In general, if a facility requests an expansion during interim status,the Agency calculates the cumulative cost of all expansions made underandSection;270.72 since the time the facility gained interim status to determineif the proposed change constitutes a reconstruction. (Note that changesmade to the facility that are not regulated under andSection;270.72 are notincluded in the cumulative cost). Today's rule raises the question of whetherchanges for which the reconstruction limit has been lifted should be includedin this calculation of cumulative cost. The Agency believes that inclusionof such changes could effectively block any subsequent change to the facilityunder andSection;270.72. Such an effect would inappropriately limit facilitychanges in interim status. Therefore, when calculating the cumulative costof changes to a facility to determine whether a proposed change would constitutea reconstruction, the Agency will exclude the cost of any changes listedunder andSection;270.72(b).D. Post-Closure PermittingToday's rule clarifies that the Agency has the authority to deny a permitfor the active life of a facility or unit while a decision with respectto the post-closure permit remains pending. This practice allows EPA toclose interim status facilities promptly through the permit denial processif they are unable to meet permitting standards, rather than delay denial(and closure) until all post-closure permit conditions have been reviewedand approved. The Agency believes that it has always had the authorityto separate these two permit decisions under the permitting regulations,although those regulations did not specifically outline such an approach.In the August 14 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, the Agency proposed modifications toits permitting regulations under 40 CFR Part 270 that would make clearthis authority. Those amendments, promulgated today, make the followingchanges: A new andSection;270.29 is added to specify that the permittingauthority may deny a permit under 40 CFR Part 124 either in its entiretyor as to the operating portion only; amended andSection;270.1(c) clarifiesthat any such partial denial does not affect a facility's responsibilityto obtain the post-closure permit; and, amended andSection;270.10(c) specifiesthat the permitting authority may deny the operating portion of a permitwithout awaiting an application that is complete as to post-closure responsibilities.Finally, to assure fairness in this process, today's rule amends andSection;andSection;124.1(a),124.15 (a) and (b), and 124.19 to clarify that a decision under andSection;270.29to deny the operating portion of a permit is subject generally to Part124 procedures and, in particular, to the appeals procedures of andSection;124.19.The amendments allow EPA to deal expeditiously with facilities or unitsclearly unable to meet standards for operation under Part 264. They clarifythe Agency's authority, in such cases, to move more expeditiously to permitdenial and initiation of the closure process. At the same time, the amendmentsmake it clear that such permit denial does not relieve the facility ofits post-closure care responsibilities under the Part 264 standards oncethe post-closure permit is issued. Prior to issuance of the post-closurepermit, the facility or unit remains subject to Part 265 standards. (<T3>See</T3> andSection;265.1(b)).If the Agency did not have the authority to bifurcate the permit decisionand instead were limited to only one permit decision, then it would haveto issue the permit for the post-closure care period at the same time thatit denied the portion of the permit concerning operational life. Developmentof the post-closure information necessary for a complete application andfor issuance of the post-closure portion of the permit can be very time-consuming.Thus, the Agency's permitting decision to close a facility could be greatlydelayed due to the need to develop post-closure information, even afterit became clear that the facility would not be permitted for continuedoperation.For instance, under andSection;124.3(d), failure to submit sufficient informationfor permitting is a basis for permit denial. However, if the Agency couldnot deny a permit without simultaneously issuing the post-closure portionof the permit, the permit decision for the facility would be delayed, allowingthe facility to continue operation while the Agency gathered informationnecessary to develop a post-closure permit. In fact, the permit denialmight be delayed longer for facilities that have greater deficiencies intheir applications, thus rewarding facilities that are in greater noncompliance.The Agency pointed out in the preamble of the proposed rule that it cannotunder these amendments bifurcate the <T3>issuance</T3> of an operating permit and a post-closure permit. Nopermit may be issued without conditions covering the post-closure periodapplicable to the facility. One commenter questioned whether EPA in factadhered to that requirement. The commenter cited a permit that containedno post-closure permit but only incorporated a reference to the post-closureplan. In fact, the permit described by the commenter appears to be consistentwith EPA policy, because it contains post-closure conditions (albeit byreference). At the time of ``closure,'' a separate ``post-closure permit''would not be issued; instead, the facility owner/operator would be requiredto follow the terms of the post-closure plan incorporated into the permit.One commenter objected that a bifurcated permit issuance process wouldviolate due process rights of owners and operators of interim status facilities.First, the commenter argued that, rather than deny a permit for the activelife and issue a post-closure permit, the Agency should use its enforcementauthority to force closure. The Agency agrees that enforcement may in manycases be the appropriate authority for forcing closure at interim statusfacilities unable to comply with the regulations. However, the Agency alsohas the responsibility and in fact is required to deny applications foran operating permit at such facilities, as well as at facilities that proveunwilling to or incapable of preparing a complete application.Second, the commenter argued that the proposed amendment would providethe Agency with unfettered discretion to deny a permit application at anystage of the process and that possible abuse could occur if the Agencywere to use proposed andSection;270.10(c) rather than the notice of deficiency/responseprocedures specified in andSection;124.3 as a means of addressing incompleteapplications. The Agency does not agree. To deny a permit, the Agency mustfollow the applicable procedures of 40 CFR Part 124; today's rule doesnot change that. The new andSection;270.29 provides that ``[t]he Directormay, pursuant to the procedures in Part 124, deny the permit applicationeither in its entirety or as to the active life of a facility or unit only.''Permit denial under section 124 presupposes that the completeness reviewprocess of andSection;124.3 has been satisfied. In addition, andSection;124.6(b)requires that, if the Agency decides to deny a permit application, it mustfirst issue a notice of intent to deny. This, of course, includes a noticeof intent to deny a permit for the operating life of a facility and, thisnotice must follow the same procedures as any draft permit under that section,that is, it must be accompanied by a statement of basis and a fact sheet,based on the administrative record, publicly noticed, and made availablefor public comment. (<T3>See</T3> andSection;124.6(e)). In addition, to assure clarity, the Agencyhas amended andSection;andSection;124.1, 124.15 (a) and (b), and 124.19 intoday's rule to indicate specifically that the decision to deny the operatinglife portion of a permit is subject to appeal under the procedures of andSection;124.19.Thus, today's amendments do not change the applicability of Part 124 proceduresfor permit denial, which the Agency believes provide owners and operatorsof interim status facilities full due process protection.The commenter also pointed out that the Agency amended andSection;270.10(c)on December 1, 1987 (52 FR 45788) in a rule that codified certain HSWAprovisions. The Agency recognizes this fact and further amends that sectionin this rule.One commenter pointed out that while the preamble language discussed bifurcationof permit decisions in terms of ``facilities'', the regulatory languagein proposed andSection;andSection;270.1(c) and 270.10(c) referred to ``units''.The Agency agrees with the commenter that this discrepancy requires clarification.Generally, it is the Agency's practice to issue or deny permits for entirefacilities, addressing all units in operation or closing at the site. However,the Agency has authority, under andSection;270.1(c)(4), to issue or denya permit for one or more units at a facility without simultaneously issuingor denying a permit to all units at the facility. To make it clear thatthe Agency can either bifurcate its permit denial and post-closure permitdecisions with respect to the entire facility or for selected units atthe facility, the Agency has modified the language in today's revisionsto andSection;andSection;270.1 and 270.10(c) to refer to ``facility or unit.''E. Permit Modifications to Comply With the Land Disposal Restrictions andto Facilitate TreatmentOn September 28, 1988 (53 FR 37912), EPA established a new three-tieredsystem of procedures for permittee-initiated permit modifications. In thatrule, specific facility changes were classified as either Class 1, 2, or3 modifications. On November 17, 1988 (53 FR 46474), EPA requested furthercomment in this rulemaking on whether it would be appropriate to allow,as Class 1 modifications, certain facility changes that are necessary tocomply with the land disposal restrictions and to otherwise facilitatetreatment of hazardous wastes. After reviewing comments on this notice,EPA is today amending the permit modification requirements to add the followingtypes of modifications:<ITAG tagnum="81">Class 1 modifications without prior approval</ITAG>1. Addition of new waste codes (or a narrative description) for <T3>disposal</T3> of restricted wastes if:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Treated to BDAT standards, or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Treated in compliance with ``soft-hammer'' standards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_In addition, the waste must be disposed of in landfills or surfaceimpoundments meeting minimum technology requirements.</ITAG> 2. Addition of new waste codes (or a narrative description) for <T3>disposal</T3> of treated wastewater, waste-water treatment residues,and incinerator ash containing non-restricted waste codes, if:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Disposed of in a landfill or surface impoundment meeting minimumtechnology requirements, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The receiving landfill or surface impoundment previously handledthat type of waste</ITAG>3. Addition of new waste codes (or a narrative description) for <T3>treatment</T3> if:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Receiving unit is a tank or container, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_No new tanks or containers and no new management or treatment processesare added, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The receiving unit previously handled that type of waste</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Class 1 modification with prior approval</ITAG>1. Addition of new tanks or containers or new treatment processes in tanksor containers (with or without addition of new waste codes), if:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Used for treatment of restricted wastes to BDAT or ``soft hammer''standards</ITAG>Each of these new permit modifications are discussed in greater detailbelow.<T3>1. Disposal of Restricted Wastes that Meet Treatment Standards. </T3>Inthe November 17 notice, the Agency requested comment on establishing anew Class 1 modification for the addition of new waste codes, or a narrativedescription of wastes, to a permit when the addition covers restrictedwastes that meet the applicable treatment standards (i.e., the treatmentstandard promulgated in Subpart D of Part 268, which standard is basedon performance of the Best Demonstrated Available Technology). This changewould apply to treatment residues from restricted wastes (including wastesderived therefrom) treated to BDAT levels, or that meet the treatment standardsas generated. In addition, the Agency requested comment on whether thesemodifications should be limited to situations where the receiving unitmet the minimum technological requirements.All of the commenters who responded to this request for further commentsupported the general concept of establishing this new Class 1 modification.A few commenters expressed a preference for Agency approval prior to sucha facility change. However, most commenters argued that prior Agency approvalshould not be required. Since the wastes would already meet BDAT treatmentstandards, the requirement for prior Agency approval would have littleenvironmental benefit and would only delay the implementation of the changes.In addition, many commenters also argued that the minimum technologicalrequirements should not be required for landfills or surface impoundmentsreceiving these wastes because the wastes would meet BDAT standards, andso may legally be disposed in non-MTR landfills and, in limited circumstances,non-MTR impoundments.EPA agrees with the commenters who urged that this modification be Class1 without prior Agency approval. However, the Agency disagrees with thecommenters who argued that minimum technological requirements should notapply to receiving landfills and surface impoundments. The rationale forestablishing a Class 1 modification without prior Agency approval for thesetypes of permit changes is based on the fact that the wastes will be treatedin accordance with the applicable treatment standards and that they willbe placed in receiving units that meet the most stringent unit design standards(i.e., minimum technology requirements). These prerequisites will assurethat the permit modification will be relatively minor and, therefore, appropriatefor Class 1. Under the Class 1 process, facilities implementing the changemust notify the Agency within 7 days of implementation, and the Agencyretains the right to reject a Class 1 modification for cause (e.g., notmeeting the Class 1 modification preconditions).Several commenters pointed out that the minimum technological standardsare not imposed on landfills and surface impoundments that would otherwisebe subject to those standards as long as they qualify for the exemptionin section 3004(o) (2) and (3) (e.g., the unit has alternative design andoperating practices or is a monofill). EPA agrees with these commentersthat restricted wastes destined for a unit that qualifies for the section3004(o) (2) or (3) exemption may also be added to the permit as a Class1 change. This could include impoundments that meet certain of the section3005(j) exceptions to retrofitting. (See 50 FR 28710, July 15, 1985, and53 FR 31185-186, August 17, 1988). The Agency believes that this is equitableand protective since these two exemptions are allowed only in situationswhere environmental protection equivalent to the minimum technologicalrequirements will be achieved.In summary, today's rule allows the addition of new waste codes, or a narrativewaste description, to a permit as a Class 1 modification where the additioninvolves a restricted waste that meets the applicable treatment standards,provided that the waste is disposed in a landfill or surface impoundmentunit that meets the minimum technology requirements set forth at section3004(o) (including the exemptions in section 3004(o) (2) and (3)). Themodification appears in items (H)(5)(c) (surface impoundments) and J(6)(C)(landfills) of Appendix I to andSection; 270.42.This amendment will provide permittees the ability to respond quickly tothe requirements of the land disposal restrictions. This will facilitateimplementation of the land disposal restrictions program by helping toensure that there is an ultimate disposal outlet for properly treated hazardouswastes (and for wastes that already meet treatment standards). Withouta means a disposal, treatment facilities will not accept restricted wastesfor treatment, thus undermining the whole purpose of the land disposalrestrictions effort. Today's rule will also expedite final dispositionof restricted wastes and will encourage the use of units that meet theminimum technological standards. It should be noted that those permitteeswho have landfill or surface impoundment units that do not meet the minimumtechnological requirements may generally use the Class 2 procedures toadd waste codes for restricted waste treated to (or that meet) BDAT standards.<T3>2. Soft Hammer Waste Treatment Residues.</T3> In the November 17 notice,EPA solicited comment on whether the addition of waste codes, or a narrativedescription, for the receipt of residues from the treatment of ``soft hammer''wastes should also be a Class 1 modification. Further, the Agency requestedcomment on whether such Class 1 modifications should be available onlywhen a certification has been submitted pursuant to andSection; 268.8. Thiscertification would ensure that these wastes would have to be treated bythe practically available technologies that yield the greatest environmentalbenefit (andSection; 268.8(a)(2)(ii)). Under the approach described in theNovember 17 notice, therefore, Class 1 modifications would not be availablefor adding waste codes, or a narrative description, for: (1) <T3>Untreated</T3> ``soft hammer'' wastes, or (2) any treated ``soft hammerwastes'' that will not be disposed in a minimum technology landfill orsurface impoundment (e.g., if the waste is destined for a land treatmentunit).Most commenters argued that the addition of waste codes to a permit forthe receipt of residuals from the treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastes shouldbe defined as Class 1 without prior Agency approval. Furthermore, severalcommenters believed that this modification should include the receipt ofuntreated ``soft hammer'' wastes.EPA agrees with the commenters in general regarding the need for greaterflexibility for permittees to be able to accept treated ``soft hammer''wastes and, therefore, is today promulgating such permit changes as a Class1 modification. (<T3>See </T3>Appendix I to andSection; 270.42, items H(5)(c) (surface impoundments)and J(6)(c) (landfills)). However, the Agency has determined that onlythe ``soft hammer'' treatment residues for which there is a andSection; 268.8certification should qualify for Class 1 modifications. EPA believes thatthis limitation is necessary since today's rule is designed in large partto further the legitimate treatment of restricted wastes and to advancethe ultimate goal of the land disposal restrictions statutory provisions.Allowing disposal of untreated soft hammer wastes (i.e., soft hammer wastesfor which a generator certifies that there is no practically availabletreatment) does not further these objectives. Furthermore, since no andSection;268.8 certification is to be filed for soft hammer wastes not destinedfor disposal in a landfill or impoundment, there is no ready benchmarkto evaluate the extent of treatment of such wastes, making the Class 1modification inappropriate. Other permit changes involving ``soft hammer''wastes or residues can generally be allowable under the Class 2 procedures.<T3>3. Other Treatment Residues. </T3>EPA, in response to comment, is alsoallowing as a Class 1 modification without prior approval the additionof new waste codes (or a new narrative description of particular wastes)by a disposal facility to receive residues from wastewater treatment orincineration, or to receive treated wastewater, provided that the disposalunit meets minimum technology requirements, and provided that the surfaceimpoundment or landfill has previously handled this type of waste. Forexample, if the facility already receives wastewater treatment sludge fromtreating multi-waste code leachate, it could add waste codes (or a narrativedescription) to allow it to continue to receive this same type of waste.In addition, today's rule would allow disposal facilities to modify theirpermits to receive multi-waste code incinerator ash as a Class 1 modification,without prior approval, where the facility already is permitted to acceptincinerator ash and the waste is placed in an MTR unit. These modificationsare described in items H(5)(d) (surface impoundments) and J(6)(d) (landfills)of Appendix I.EPA is adopting this provision in response to comment, and also is actingto assure that there are means of disposing of properly treated residuesfrom wastewater treatment and from incineration. As the Agency indicatedin the November 17 notice, there are many forms of wastewater treatmentand incineration that approximate BDAT that should be facilitated. (<T3>See </T3>53 FR 46477). Treatment will not occur, however, if thereis no means of disposing of the residues from such treatment. The Agencyalso is assuring that only land disposal units with the most safeguardsare eligible for receipt of these treatment residues by limiting eligibilityfor this Class 1 modification to disposal in minimum technology landfillsand surface impoundments.<T3>4. Addition of Wastes at Treatment Facilities. </T3>The Agency alsosolicited comment on whether greater flexibility should be provided fortreatment facilities receiving hazardous wastewaters and wastewater treatmentresidues carrying multiple waste codes not yet subject to land disposalrestrictions. EPA specifically cited the problems potentially faced bytreatment facilities handling leachate derived from the disposal of wastein the second or third of the schedule. Although the facility's level oftreatment might approximate eventual BDAT, if the leachate or leachatetreatment residue carries too many waste codes, the treatment facility'spermit could preclude immediate receipt. (It should be noted that althoughmany wastewater treatment tank facilities do not require RCRA permits,some do. (<T3>See generally</T3>, 53 FR 34080-81, September 2, 1988). Permits alsoare required for tanks treating wastewater treatment residues that arenon-wastewaters).Commenters on this question generally recommended that EPA provide broadflexibility for facilities receiving such wastes. In reviewing these commentsas well as the principle underlying the current permit modification rules,however, the Agency concluded that a broad approach, setting no limitson the types of wastes received or the treatment conducted would be inappropriate_particularlywhere a Class 1 modification without prior approval was contemplated. Asa result, the Agency has decided on a narrower approach, focusing on thespecific examples cited in the November 17 notice.Today's rulemaking, consequently, establishes a Class 1 modification withoutprior approval to allow tank and container treatment facilities to addwaste codes (or a narrative description) provided that the treatment occursin tanks or containers, the facility does not add any new treatment unitsor types of treatment processes (i.e., methods), the waste does not requireany new management standards, and the facility previously handled thattype of waste. (<T3>See </T3>F(4)(b) (containers) and G(5)(d) (tanks)).The Agency notes that in response to comment, it has determined that thisClass 1 modification should be available without prior approval. The Agencybelieves that the limitations placed on eligibility assure minimal changesin existing treatment facility operation, and that the further limitationto treatment in tanks and containers will result in this modification beingavailable only in situations with minimum potential for adverse environmentalimpact. The Agency also notes that this amendment will in many cases encompassrestricted wastes, and thus addresses changes that were covered by theformer andSection; 270.42(p), which was superseded on September 28, 1988.In addition, as already noted, the Agency is attempting to avoid regulatoryimpediments to proper treatment, and believes that this amendment furthersthat objective. Moreover, to the extent restricted wastes are involved(and by May, 1990, most wastes will be restricted), this modification furthersthe ultimate goals of the land disposal restrictions program as well byincreasing availability of treatment and thus allowing the land disposalprohibitions to go into effect without the need of national or case-by-casevariances based on lack of existing treatment capacity.<T3>5. New Tanks and Containers to Perform Treatment. </T3>In the November17 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, EPA requested comment on the establishmentof a Class 1 modification with prior Agency approval for the addition ofnew waste codes (or a narrative description) where additional tanks andcontainers, or new treatment processes that take place in tanks and containers,are necessary to treat restricted wastes to meet treatment standards. (Theamendment would also cover addition of new tanks or containers, or newtreatment processes, without addition of new waste codes). This would includepartial treatment that meets treatment standards for some of the hazardousconstituents in a waste mixture. Treatment would include treatment accordingto BDAT standards, or for ``soft hammer'' wastes, treatment for which acertification will be filed pursuant to andSection;268.8. This modificationwould be similar to the previous minor modifications in andSection;270.42(o) and (p) that were superseded by the permit modification rule publishedon September 28, 1988. Most commenters supported this modification andits classification, and the Agency is today promulgating this provisionas proposed. (<T3>See </T3>Appendix I of andSection;270.42, items F(1)(c) and G(1)(e)).It should be noted that this modification would require Class 1 procedures,<T3>with </T3>prior Director approval. The Agency previously determined,in promulgating the former andSection;270.42 (o) and (p), that flexibilityin adding treatment processes, treatment capacity, and waste codes of restrictedwastes, would encourage availability of treatment to meet the BDAT standardsand thus would further the objectives of the land disposal restrictionsprogram. (<T3>See </T3>52 FR 25781, July 8, 1987). At the same time, the Agency stillbelieves that if new tanks or containers, or new treatment processes intanks or containers, are to be added by the facility, prior Director approvalshould be required before the modification goes into effect. (In this regard,EPA disagrees with the commenter who stated that the former andSection;270.42(p)did not require prior Director approval; it in fact did require such approval.)Another commenter stated that this modification should also include treatmentin devices ``similar to'' tanks and containers. The commenter specificallycited distillation units as an example of such units. The Agency disagreeswith this comment. In the first place, most distillation units will probablyfall within the definition of tank, and therefore this amendment is unnecessary.(<T3>See </T3>52 FR 3762-63, February 5, 1987). More importantly, it wouldbe very difficult, if not impossible, to define by regulation which unitswere ``similar to'' tanks and which were not. The Agency, therefore, isnot adopting this suggestion. <T3>6. Other Issues. </T3>In commenting on the November 17 notice, severalcommenters raised a number of issues directly related to the ``derivedfrom'' rule as discussed in the August 17, 1988 First Thirds Land DisposalRestrictions rule (53 FR 31138). Today's rule only addresses proceduralconcerns arising from the Agency's long-standing interpretation of the``derived from'' rule. The more substantive aspects regarding the applicationof the ``derived from'' provisions are not part of this rulemaking. Today's Class 1 modifications also do not apply to the listed dioxin-containinghazardous wastes (F020, 021, 022, 023, 026, 027, and 028). Such an amendmentraises complicated issues beyond the scope of the Agency's notice and notdiscussed in any detail in the public comments. The Agency also adds one further note respecting waste codes. Federal RCRAregulations do not require that waste codes be listed in permits. Althoughsuch permits must contain some language authorizing receipt of particularhazardous wastes, that language might for example take the form of a narrativedescription (for example ``residues from incineration'' or ``residues fromtreating leachate''). Thus, facilities wishing to modify their permitspursuant to today's amendments could do so by establishing a narrativedescription of allowable wastes instead of by adding particular waste codes.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. State Authority </ITAG>A. Applicability of Rule in Authorized States Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administerand enforce the RCRA program within the State. (<T3>See </T3>40 CFR, Part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization).Following authorization, EPA retains enforcement authority under sections3008, 7003, and 3013 of RCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcementresponsibility. Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, a Statewith final authorization administered its hazardous waste program entirelyin lieu of EPA administering the Federal Program in that State. The Federalrequirements no longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could notissue permits for any facilities in the State that the State was authorizedto permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgatedor enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority withinspecified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect inan authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.In contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirementsand prohibitions imposed by the HSWA take effect in authorized States atthe same time that they take effect in nonauthorized States. EPA is directedto implement those requirements and prohibitions in an authorized State,including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorizationto do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as Statelaw to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States inthe interim. However, it should be noted that section 3009 of RCRA and andSection;271.1(i)provide that States can impose requirements that are more stringent thanthe Federal requirements. Federal program changes that are less stringentor reduce the scope of the Federal program do not have to be adopted byauthorized States. Furthermore, any authorized State requirement that ismore stringent than a newly enacted less-stringent Federal provision remainsin effect as authorized State law. This is true even if the less stringentFederal requirements are imposed by HSWA. For less stringent Federal programchanges (or changes that reduce the scope of the program), the combinedeffect of RCRA sections 3006 and 3009 will result in one of the two followingsituations. In the first case, if the new Federal requirements are promulgatedpursuant to pre-HSWA authority, such requirements will not take effectin an authorized State unless and until the State chooses to adopt themas part of the State program. In contrast, less stringent Federal requirementsthat are imposed by HSWA authority become part of the Federal program thatis in effect in all States, including authorized States; however, as discussedabove, any more stringent State requirement remains in effect as authorizedState law. Therefore, as a practical matter, the regulated community maynot be able to benefit from the less stringent Federal HSWA provisionsuntil the State chooses to amend its more stringent authorized RCRA regulationsor enabling authority. B. Effect on State AuthorizationsToday's rule is considered to be less stringent than, or to reduce thescope of, existing Federal requirements. Therefore, authorized States arenot required to modify their programs to adopt requirements equivalentto these provisions.Today's rule is not a rule that imposes a requirement or prohibition pursuantto HSWA. However, portions of today's rule may be necessary in appropriatesituations to effectively implement HSWA. For example, use of a Class 1modification to add waste codes and/or narrative descriptions of treatmentresidues to RCRA permits may be necessary in appropriate situations toeffectively implement the treatment requirements and prohibitions of theHSWA land disposal restrictions program. Other examples would involve achange in interim status needed to comply with an EPA-issued section 3008(h)corrective action order or to comply with the minimum technology requirementsof HSWA section 3004(o). Hence, the portions of today's rule necessaryto implement HSWA in appropriate situations will be immediately effectiveand administered by EPA in all States pursuant to RCRA section 3006(g).The Agency notes that a permit modification that specifies waste codesand/or narrative descriptions for a permit that previously did not specifywaste codes and/or provided a less specific description may create a morestringent permit. Furthermore, during EPA's administration of today's rule,depending on State law, a State may not need to take any action to recognizethe effectiveness of a Class 1 modification.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Effective Date</ITAG>Today's rule is effective immediately. Section 3010(b) of RCRA providesthat regulations respecting permits for the treatment, storage, or disposalof hazardous waste shall take effect six months after the date of promulgation.However, section 3010(b)(1) of RCRA allows EPA to shorten the time to theeffective date if the Agency finds that the regulated community does notneed six months to come into compliance with the new regulation.Today's rule establishes requirements that are less stringent than requirementscurrently in place. Since the rule relaxes regulations with which the regulatedcommunity is required to comply, the Agency finds that the regulated communitydoes not need six months to come into compliance. In addition, the Agencybelieves that it is important for these amendments to become effectiveas soon as possible, because of the need for flexibility on the part ofinterim status facilities to comply with new requirements coming into effect,such as the land disposal restrictions and corrective action. These reasonsalso provide good cause for making today's rule immediately effective undersection 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact AnalysisUnder Executive Order 12291, EPA must determine whether a regulation is``major'' and thus whether it must prepare and consider a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis in connection with the rule. Today's rule is not major becauseit will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore, nor will it result in an increase in costs or prices to industry.There will be no adverse impact on the ability of U.S.-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Therefore, the Agency has not prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis fortoday's rule. This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management andBudget in accordance with Executive Order 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.,</T3> at the time an Agency publishes a proposed or final rule,it must prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis that describes the impactof the rule on small entities, unless the Administrator certifies thatthe rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. Today's rule provides more flexibility for treatment,storage, or disposal facilities to respond to new requirements and doesnot affect the compliance burdens of the regulated community. Therefore,pursuant to 5 U.S.C 601b, I certify that this regulation will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>40 CFR Part 124Administrative practice and procedure, Hazardous waste, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.40 CFR Part 270Administrative practice and procedure, Hazardous waste, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Permit application requirements, Permit modification procedures,Waste treatment and disposal.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
