The conditions required consist in the availability oflarge solar collector fields to utilize the heat accumulating duringsunny summer seasons. Industry for example in many cases can use thissolar heat as process heat. Since 1983 the Rismuss cellerage (Hallau/Switzerland)disposes of a pilot/demonstration plant errected by the Delta EnergieAG. While the plant served to investigate into the feasible uses of large-scalesolar power generation a parallel research program was to examine theparameters relevant to the conversion of solar energy into industrialenergy. The report discusses the results of the research program concerningthe plant's economy, service life, efficiency etc..</TEXT></DOC>
