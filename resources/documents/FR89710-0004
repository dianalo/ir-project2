Subpart Cis intended to inform the public of the possibility of bounty payments;to encourage those who may have information indicating violations of thefederal securities laws to provide that information to the Commission;and to provide the structure for an orderly administration of the processof making bounty payments.\3\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78u-1(e). Section 21A(e), which became effectiveon November 19, 1988, was added to the Exchange Act by the Insider Tradingand Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-704, 102Stat. 4677. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In general, section 21A authorizes courts to impose civilpenalties against any person who has violated the Exchange Act by purchasingor selling a security while in possession of material, nonpublic informationin, or has violated [the Exchange Act] by communicating such informationin connection with, a transaction on or through the facilities of a nationalsecurities exchange or from or through a broker or dealer.* * * <ITAG tagnum="28">Section 21A(a)(1). In addition, section 21A(a)(1)(B) authorizes impositionof civil penalties against persons who directly or indirectly control suchviolators. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ While the new rules are procedural in nature and do notrequire notice and comment rulemaking, any interested person may providecomments on the rules to the individual named and at the address providedunder the caption ``For Further Information Contact.''Under section 21A(e), all Commission determinations regarding bounties,including whether to make a payment, to whom a payment shall be made, andthe amount of a payment (if any), are in the sole discretion of the Commission.Any such determination is final and not subject to judicial review. Nothingin Subpart C is intended to limit the Commission's discretion with respectto bounties. Section 21A(e) contains a number of limitations on the Commission's abilityto award bounties. Bounties may only be awarded from amounts that are imposedas civil penalties in insider trading litigation under section 21A of theExchange Act and that are recovered by the Commission or by the AttorneyGeneral on behalf of the Commission. The total amount of bounties thatmay be paid from a penalty may not exceed ten percent of that penalty.In addition, bounty payments may be made only to the person or personswho provided information leading to the imposition of the penalty. Finally,section 21A provides that no bounty may be paid to ``any member, officer,or employee of any appropriate regulatory agency, the Department of Justice,or a self-regulatory organization.'' \4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Depending upon the circumstances, the term ``appropriateregulatory agency'' may include federal bank regulatory authorities aswell as the Commission. Section 3(a)(34) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.78c(a)(34). ``Self-regulatory organizations'' include national securitiesexchanges, registered securities associations, and registered clearingagencies. Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26). In making determinations regarding bounty applications, the Commissionwill be guided both by the purposes of the Congress in enacting Section21A and by the limitations contained in section  21A(e). The Commissionwill also consider whatever other factors it deems relevant, including,as examples, the importance of the information provided by an applicant,whether that information was provided voluntarily, other applications inthe matter, and the amount of the penalty from which bounties may be paid.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of Subpart C </ITAG>Subpart C consists of eight new rules, Rules 61-68. Rule 61 sets forththe general scope of Subpart C, refers to the statutory premises of thebounty procedures, and provides that nothing contained in the subpart limitsthe Commission's discretion regarding bounty determinations or subjectsthose determinations to judicial review. Rule 62 provides procedures relating to bounty applications. Written applicationsthat conform to the provisions of Subpart C are required before a bountypayment may be made. Upon request of the Commission or its staff, personsseeking bounties must also provide other relevant information. This provisionis designed to permit the Commission to be certain that its bounty paymentsare in accordance with law and to assure that the Commission has all relevantinformation needed to make informed decisions regarding applications forbounties. The Commission anticipates that the classes of information thatmay be relevant may include: the employment and affiliations of the applicant;the conduct of the applicant in connection with the violative activityand the relationship of the applicant to other persons and entities involvedin the matter; the means by which the applicant came into possession ofthe information for which an award is sought; and any action taken by theapplicant to mitigate the effects of violative conduct or to prevent furtherviolative conduct in the matter. Rule 63 specifies the time and place of filing for applications for bounties.Applications must be filed no later than 180 days after entry of the courtorder requiring the payment of the penalty that is subject to the application.Rule 64 governs the form of bounty applications and requires a detailedstatement of the information upon which a bounty may be based, i.e., theinformation that the applicant believes led or may lead to the impositionof a penalty under Section 2lA of the Exchange Act. Where the applicationis not the means by which a bounty applicant initially provides informationto the Commission, the application must also specify the dates and timeswhen the information was previously provided; to whom the information wasprovided; how the information was provided (<T3>e.g., </T3>by telephone call or in person); and, when information wasinitially provided anonymously, sufficient other information to confirmthat the applicant is the person who provided the information to the Commission.Any person who desires to provide information to the Commission that mayresult in the payment of a bounty may do so by any means desired. However,the Commission wishes to emphasize the utility of providing such informationin writing as soon as possible, either in the form of an application fora bounty or otherwise. Providing information in writing reduces the possibilityof error, helps assure that appropriate action will be taken, and minimizessubsequent burdens and the possibility of factual disputes. The Commission recognizes that there may be instances when a bounty applicantwishes to remain temporarily anonymous.\5\<NOTE/> Rule 65 takes into account these instances. All applicationsmust identify and be signed by the applicant, and must provide the applicant'smailing address. However, that information may be omitted provided thatit is submitted by an amendment to the application. The amendment mustbe filed within 180 days after the entry of the court order requiring thepayment of the penalty upon which the bounty is based. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Individuals who provide information to the Commissionoften request that their identities be held in confidence. Absent compellingcause, the Commission ordinarily does not disclose the identities of thesepersons. The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(D)), and thePrivacy Act of l974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5)) permit agencies to withhold theidentity of a confidential source. However, there may be circumstancesin which disclosure will nonetheless be legally required or will be essentialfor the protection of the public interest. For example, in litigation acourt may order disclosure, or the Commission may have to present a bountyclaimant as a witness in order to assure the success of an enforcementaction. Thus, while the Commission and its staff will give serious considerationto requests for confidentiality of identity, no guarantees of confidentialityare possible.Rule 66 provides that the Commission will notify an applicant of its determinationon the application. Normally, determinations will not be made until a paymentof a penalty is both ordered by a court and recovered. The Commission wishesto emphasize that anonymous applicants (and those who fail to make writtenapplications) will not receive the notice provided by Rule 66.    Thus,they will bear the risk of losing eligibility for a bounty award throughlapse of time or ignorance of the fact that a penalty has been recovered.Rule 67 contains provisions for filing an application by an executor, administratoror other legal representative of a person who provided information thatled or may lead to imposition of a civil penalty, or by the parent or guardianof such a person if that person is a minor. Rule 68 provides that no personis authorized by the new rules to make any offer or promise or otherwiseto bind the Commission with respect to bounty payments or their amounts.The Commission has determined that the final rules relate solely to agencyorganization, procedure or practice. Therefore, the provisions of the AdministrativeProcedure Act (``APA'') regarding notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunitiesfor public participation, 5 U.S.C. 553, are not applicable. Similarly,the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>which apply only when notice and comment rulemaking arerequired by the APA or other law, are not applicable. The Commission findsthat the rules will not impose any burden on competition. The Commissionfurther finds, because of the procedural nature of the rules, that theAPA requirement with respect to delay in the effective date of substantiverules, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), is also inapplicable.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 201</ITAG>Rules of practice.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 201_[AMENDED]</ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 17, Part 201 of the Codeof Federal Regulations, is amended by adding Subpart C as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart C_Procedures Pertaining to the Payment of Bounties Pursuantto Subsection 21A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70"> Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">201.61 Scope of subpart.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">201.62 Application required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">201.63 Time and place of filing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">201.64 Form of application and information required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">201.65 Identity and signature.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">201.66 Notice to applicants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">201.67 Applications by legal guardians.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">201.68 No promises of payment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 21A, 102 Stat. 4679, sec. 23, 48 Stat. 901, asamended, 15 U.S.C. 78u-1, 78w.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart C_Procedures Pertaining to the Payment of Bounties Pursuantto Subsection 21A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 201.61</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scope of subpart.</ITAG>Section 21A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 authorizes the courtsto impose civil penalties for certain violations of that Act.
