John R. Lytle, a former vice president in charge of oil and gas lending in Oklahoma for the company's Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago unit, is accused of improperly making loans in return for a $585,000 kickback.    In all, Mr. Lytle oversaw the purchase of more than $1 billion in loans from Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City, leading to losses of more than $800 million at Continental. The Penn Square debacle was the biggest single factor in Continental's 1984 collapse.    Mr. Lytle and two other men were originally indicted that same year, the day after the government's record $4.5 billion bailout of Continental was completed. But a series of setbacks to prosecutors has kept the case from trial. Lawyers familiar with the case now regard the chances of winning convictions as 50-50 at best.    The trial comes as the Justice Department, under prodding from Congress, is pushing to improve its record on bank fraud prosecution. The number of costly financial-institution failures where self-dealing by insiders occurred has mushroomed in recent years, according to banking and savings and loan regulators, and prosecutors haven't begun to keep up with the problem.    Despite increased numbers of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and assistant U.S. attorneys assigned to the cases, especially in Texas, California and Florida, the government has been overwhelmed.    The U.S. attorney here, Anton R. Valukas, has been successful in winning dozens of bank fraud indictments and convictions, including the conviction last year of former Illinois Gov. Dan Walker on charges of perjury and misapplication of bank funds. But the combined cost to banks and federal regulators from all those alleged crimes is small-fry stuff compared with the Continental case, with its huge losses.    Mr. Lytle; William Patterson, the former energy lending chief at Penn Square; and Jere A. Sturgis, an Oklahoma oil man accused of helping Penn Square funnel money to Mr. Lytle, have all denied any wrongdoing. In a separate case arising out of Penn Square's 1982 failure, Mr. Patterson was acquitted on all counts in 1984.    The government charges that Mr. Lytle received the kickback in the form of personal loans from Penn Square, while the banker was buying scores of oil and gas loans made by Penn Square -- loans that didn't meet Continental's standards.    As simple as that sounds, Joseph Duffy, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the case, will have a tough time proving the charges to a federal court jury without also putting the panel to sleep. He must go through many complicated loan transactions made seven to eight years ago in the midst of the oil boom, and prove the loans were improper at the time, not merely victims of an oil bust that soon followed.    In a related civil case last year against Continental's former auditors, Ernst andamp; Whinney, brought by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., most of the jury appeared dulled by months of tedious testimony about the oil and gas business, the banks' lending procedures and the economic climate during the early 1980s. And Ernst andamp; Whinney, which had denied any wrongdoing, was cleared of charges of performing a shoddy audit.    Mr. Duffy, who wouldn't comment on the case, is expected to try to avoid a rerun of the Ernst andamp; Whinney trial, keeping the number of loan transactions to a minimum. But the trial before U.S. District Court Judge Milton I. Shadur is nevertheless expected to last six weeks or more.    Mr. Lytle's lawyers are expected to contend that he was just following orders of Continental's top management, which had launched the bank on a highly aggressive growth program, specifically targeting oil and gas loans. Higher-ups approved the Penn Square loans, his lawyers will also argue. And even when Continental's brass learned of Mr. Lytle's personal loans, they didn't initially fire him, but instead transferred him out of oil and gas lending and withheld his bonus. </TEXT></DOC>
