Thecharacteristics of the e/sup +/ production line Z/sub u/ and scatteringangle dependence as well as their spectral distribution is well understoodtheoretically. Superimposed on the e/sup +/ continua, e/sup +/ lineswere discovered with energies independent on Z/sub u/ but with crosssections which rise with Z/sub u//sup 22/. The line energies are groupedaround 250 and 340 keV for all systems with 164 andless; Z/sub u/ andless; 184. Forheavy systems (U-Th and U-U) a third line at about 400 keV is seen. Thereis strong indication that these positron lines have a common source namelyneutral particles produced in the high Coulomb fields, which decay intoe/sup +/-e/sup -/ pairs. This is indicated by e/sup +/-e/sup -/ coincidenceexperiments which show evidence for energy and angle correlated e/sup+/-e/sup -/ emission expected for a particle decay.</TEXT></DOC>
