The Alitalia accord will be modeled after one signed between United and British Airways last December, the sources said. Under that accord, the two carriers agreed to share terminals at certain airports, offer price promotions to connecting customers, share flight numbers on certain routes and to launch joint ad campaigns.    United, which doesn't fly to Europe, is a unit of Chicago-based UAL Corp. A United spokesman said the U.S. carrier &quot;has been working with Alitalia to develop a partnership beyond the existing one for some time,&quot; but he wouldn't elaborate. Alitalia is one of several European carriers with an equity stake in United's Covia computerized reservations system. Also, Alitalia's schedules are displayed in United's reservation system and it participates in United's frequent-flier program.    The agreement will allow Alitalia to offer travelers flights to a greatly expanded number of U.S. destinations, and could increase its ability to pick up passengers heading from the U.S. to Europe. Currently, Alitalia flies only to such major U.S. cities as New York, Washington and Los Angeles.    For United, Alitalia's network in southern Europe will provide a complement to that of British Airways in the north. The U.S. carrier will thus be able to market flights from, say, Detroit to Rome, while Alitalia could offer trips from major Italian cities to United destinations.    United has said it doesn't have any plans to start its own European flights. Said one industry analyst, &quot;this kind of arrangement is better for European carriers than having yet another competitor on the North American route.&quot; Currently some 50 air carriers offer transatlantic flights.    Separately, Alitalia ground personnel, who have been striking intermittently since September for higher pay and shorter hours, approved a new contract, a transport workers union official said. </TEXT></DOC>
