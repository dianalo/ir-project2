The process ofinitially obtaining the operating licence from the regulatory authoritywas affected by the existence of water leaks in the pool which were detectedin March 1985 and were caused by corrosion in the reactor containmentsystem. Reconditioning began with a series of activities aimed at locating,delimiting and repairing the areas damaged by corrosion and involvedestablishing criteria for selecting the most appropriate inspection,testing and repair methods. In order to obtain the operating licence,it was necessary to comply with various requirements laid down by theregulatory body. The most important requirements included: (a) repairof the reactor pool; (b) maintenance of its operational systems; (c)preparation and implementation of the Quality Control Programme; (d)updating of the Safety Report; (e) updating and preparation of operating,repair, radiation safety, emergency and administrative procedures; and(f) training of operating staff. In addition, the paper describes thework carried out at this reactor to widen its field of research and rangeof utilization. This work includes the reconditioning of a neutron diffractometer,the design and construction of a neutron diffractometer to determinethe textures of materials, and the analysis of a new mixed core configurationbased on fuels with 20% and 70% /sup 235/U enrichment.
