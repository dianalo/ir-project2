Continental said in a statement that the revised estimate wouldbe identified separately in the second-quarter earnings report ofits parent firm, Texas Air Corp.   The Houston-based airline said its estimates for categories suchas ticketing errors and currency fluctuations were short by $67million, while estimates for reaccommodation costs for transportingticketholders on other airlines was off by $64 million.   ``These accounts are really unearned revenue,'' spokesman BruceHicks said. ``When we collect for tickets, until flights are flown,it is unearned revenue and an air traffic liability.   ``The number always is an estimate. We noticed a decline in thataccount very recently and did a thorough review and in last fewdays determined the magnitude of this.''   The airline said that like other carriers, it conducts an annualverification of such accounts, but made the review earlier thannormal because the accounts had been declining in recent months.   Hicks said the changes in estimates would have no impact oncurrent or future cash levels of Continental and that the airlineexpects to be profitable for the last half of 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
