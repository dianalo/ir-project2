The experimental value EC/{beta}sup+/ = 43.7(42) is found to be in agreement within the respective errorintervals with the ones calculated from the formalism of allowed decayusing the recent Q-values of /sup 146/Eu. Further on, the {gamma}-decayproperties of /sup 146/Eu have been reinvestigated with emphasis on impliedmodifications of the hitherto accepted decay scheme: 42 new levels and33 new {gamma}-transitions were placed in the revised level scheme, 12of the previously reported levels were deleted. The level distributionof /sup 146/Sm is discussed within a statistical model. The indicationfor a non-statistical {beta}strength function is observed.</TEXT></DOC>
