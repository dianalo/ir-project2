Bush defeated Dole Tuesday night in Vermont's non-binding GOPpresidential primary, and Dukakis won the state's Democraticcontest, with Jesse Jackson running second.   ``This win gives us three out of three in New England, and I'mhopeful we can be as successful this Saturday in South Carolina andon Super Tuesday,'' Bush said.   Mary Ellen Grupp said the Dole campaign was very pleased withDole's ``strong showing'' and would use the primary results tobuild up for the GOP caucuses in April.   Former President Carter, the last Democrat to occupy the WhiteHouse, said he thought the chances were 50-50 that no Democratwould arrive at the party nominating convention with enoughdelegates to claim the nomination.   Bush sounded confident that nothing of the sort would happen inthe Republican race. Bush, in a strong position in virtually all ofthe Southern states that will vote next week, said, ``I'm convincedthat whoever wins Super Tuesday will be the next president.''   Bush was further buoyed by the results of a Washington Post-ABCNews poll released Tuesday, showing him with a nearly 3-to-1 leadover Dole among Republicans likely to vote Super Tuesday. Dukakisand Jackson were battling for the Democratic lead.   GOP hopeful Pat Robertson, meanwhile, said he intends to drophis $35 million libel suit against former Rep. Pete McCloskeyrather than go to trial on Super Tuesday.   Robertson has accused McCloskey of defaming him in a lettercontending that the former television evangelist used the influenceof his father, the late Sen. A. Willis Robertson, to avoid combatduty in the Korean War. But Robertson may not be able to walk awayfrom the suit without paying McCloskey's legal fees.   With nearly all the precincts reporting in Vermont's ``beautycontest'' primary, Bush had 49 percent to Dole's 39 percent.Robertson had 5 percent and Rep. Jack Kemp 3.4 percent.   Dukakis rolled to a solid win with 56 percent; Jackson had 27percent; Gephardt 8 percent; Paul Simon 6 percent and Gary Hart 4percent. Gore was not on the ballot.   ``We have found the common chord that is linking the Americanpeople, whether they are in Iowa or Maine or New Hampshire orMississippi,'' Jackson said about his impressive showing.   The Vermont contest did not involve allocating any delegates tothe Republican and Democratic national convention.   In contrast, Super Tuesday on March 8 involves 1,307 delegatesin Democratic primaries and caucuses in 20 states and 712 delegatesin 17 contests on the Republican side.   The broad sweep of that day's contests means candidates mustplace greater stress than ever before on costly televisioncommercials. Gone are the days of ``retail politics,'' consistingof six stops in Iowa or New Hampshire in a single day.   The new campaign style features chartered jets, trips to two orthree regions of two or three different states _ and a heavy doseof commercials scattered across several states.   In his new advertisement, Dole says that Bush has refused to sayhe would veto an increase in income tax rates, that he won'tsupport a textile import bill and that he ``supported the arms forhostages deal'' in the Iran-Contra affair.   ``That's precisely what he did _ he supported the sale of armsto Iran,'' the Kansas senator said as he campaigned in Durham, N.C.   Bush campaigned in Florida, where he said of Dole's Iran-Contracomments, ``I support the president. I have nothing to say aboutDole's charges, nothing at all.'' Instead, he touted his own rolein the decision to invade Grenada with U.S. troops in 1983, as wellas the part he has played in the administration's anti-drug program.   If Bush is heavily favored in most Republican Super Tuesdaystates, the Democratic contest shapes up as a struggle amongMassachusetts Gov. Dukakis, Missouri Rep. Gephardt, Tennessee Sen.Albert Gore Jr. and Jesse Jackson.   Ironically, it was a Democratic idea to develop a regionalSouthern primary, in the hopes that it would give a candidate fromthe deep South a springboard to the nomination.   It hasn't worked that way, and Carter, who invited Gephardt tohis home in Plains, Ga., said he is no longer sure whether the ideais good or bad.   He added, ``My hope is that out of the primary and caucus seasonwill come a clear winner. I'm not sure that's a likelihood now.''   Gephardt said he traveled to Carter's home in rural Georgia``not to enhance my prospects but to greet an old friend.''   At the same time, he began running a new commercial in whichTexas Rep. Marvin Leath says Gephardt ``stood with us for lowertaxes, for an oil import fee to make American strong, for a toughnew trade bill to stand up for American workers.''   ``On all these issues, Gore and Dukakis were opposed to us,'' hesays.   There was no immediate response from either Gore or Dukakis.   Among the other Democrats, Jackson was in Washington, where hemet with officials from South Africa about the recent arrests ofblack leaders in that country.   Sen. Paul Simon, largely skipping Southern states, campaigned inSeattle for support in the Washington caucuses.   Rep. Jack Kemp, struggling to survive in the Republican race,said if either Bush, Dole or Robertson wins the GOP nomination,``the Reagan Revolution is over.''   Robertson, under pressure for several comments he has made inthe past two weeks, said a transcript of 1967 Senate subcommitteetestimony supports his belief that there are nuclear missiles inCuba. He quoted testimony by a State Department official who said aCuban refugee told him of the missiles.   ``This is documented evidence,'' Robertson said.</TEXT></DOC>
