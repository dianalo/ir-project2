Thestudy was concentrated on the larger platforms, defined as those in waterdepths greater than 75m. Complete and partial removal of the platformswere considered. This paper is a condensed version of a fuller reportwhich included a review of possible, methods and needs of platform removal,summaries of previous reports and papers, a list of the UKCS (and Norwegian)deep water platforms and data on them, a detailed list of all the activitieswhich may be needed from the start of decommissioning to the completionof removal, notes on possible alternative ways of toppling steel-jacketplatforms, a comparative review of removal costs using risk analysis,and a list of further studies, research and development needed.</TEXT></DOC>
