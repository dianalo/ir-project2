Faludi   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/21/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><LP>   A majority of Americans, the polls say, favor militaryaction against Iraq -- even if their fellow Americans arestill trapped there. But Patty Hale is &quot;definitely not withthe majority.&quot;   Her husband, Edward, was working on an oil rig on Kuwait'snorthern border at dawn on the day of the invasion. He wasamong the first American citizens captured and whisked awayto Iraq. &quot;I can't imagine that anybody who has a familymember there would be interested in dropping bombs,&quot; shesays, &quot;unless they were interested in instant divorce. Andthat's certainly not in my mind.&quot; Mr. and Mrs. Hale have beenmarried 22 years.</LP><TEXT>   The relatives of the U.S. citizens in Kuwait and Iraqobserve with muted horror as public support for combatappears to mount. On Aug. 8, 49% of Americans favoredmilitary action even if hostages were harmed, a USAToday/Gannett News Service poll found. By Aug. 22, the samepoll found that figure had risen to 54%. And in a Wall StreetJournal/NBC poll taken this week, 53% of Americans surveyedsaid they would support military action in spite of thehostages.   Michael Saba, founder of Coming Home, a group representinghostage relatives, said that for all of the family members,&quot;their concern was with this attitude oflet's-go-over-there-and-kick-their-butts. It's extremelyfrightening to them.&quot;   But Mr. Saba said that many relatives of hostages he hastalked to feel compelled to publicly support Mr. Bush'shawkish stance. &quot;They don't want to sound unpatriotic,&quot; hesays.   Donnita Cole is &quot;a military mom and a hostage wife.&quot; Herson is a U.S. soldier stationed in the Saudi desert, herhusband &quot;a human shield&quot; somewhere in Iraq. She mailed herson and his unit a big box of provisions this week --including more than 300 paperback books to occupy the hoursunder the desert sun. But she has no mailing address for herhusband.   &quot;I'd like for these people {calling for military action}to talk to me,&quot; Mrs. Cole says. &quot;I would like for them totell me, face to face, that my Johnny is expendable. . . .These are still live human beings we're talking about.&quot;   John Cole had begun work as a drilling supervisor fourmonths before the invasion, and Mrs. Cole was about to joinhim. She had rented their Texas home, packed all theirbelongings and even booked her tickets when she got word thatIraqi troops were marching into Kuwait. Her daughter calledwith the news a half hour after midnight, Aug. 2. &quot;From 12:30on, all night long, I tried to call him. Every 20 minutes forthe next four days, I tried to call him.&quot; She never gotthrough.   The day of the invasion, Ingrid Pawlowski was in KuwaitCity with her husband, Paul, an architect for an engineeringfirm, and her seven-year-old daughter, Tess. Gunshots wokethem at 6:30 a.m. They spent the next several weeks treadingsoftly behind their drawn curtains, conserving a rapidlydwindling food supply and &quot;fearing a knock on the door,&quot; Mrs.Pawlowski says. &quot;I'd measure the success of the day by howafraid I felt.&quot; She and her daughter finally got out, but Mr.Pawlowski had to stay behind. She has not heard from him.   &quot;War is all very nice when you are sipping martinis inyour New York apartment, speculating on the pros and cons ofarmed conflict,&quot; she says. &quot;I think there's very littleunderstanding of what the realities are over there.&quot;   Mrs. Pawlowski says the press bears some responsibilityfor the warlike mentality: &quot;There seems to be less focus inthe media on the hostages&quot; than in past Middle East hostagecrises -- and more interest in combat.   Betty Seago's husband, Guy, an electronics teacher, washauled in by Iraqi troops while trying to flee in afour-wheel-drive through the desert. &quot;I try not to listen tothe polls,&quot; Mrs. Seago says softly. &quot;It looks like we'reheading toward war, but I try not to dwell on it. I go tochurch a lot.&quot;   The bellicose posture of Americans in the polls marks ashift from American public attitudes toward pasthostage-taking episodes in the Middle East -- from thedrawn-out Iranian crisis of 1979-1981 to the imprisonment ofAmericans in Beirut following the 1985 TWA hijacking overGreece.   Ironically, while these two past events involved far fewerpeople, Americans were far more leery then of taking militarysteps that might jeopardize hostages. An ABC/Washington Postpoll in June 1985, for example, found that six in 10Americans favored giving in to the hijackers' terms if thealternative meant further injury to U.S. hostages. A 1985 CBSpoll reported similar results.   During the Iranian affair, when President Carter openlyand repeatedly declared that saving hostage lives was hisfirst priority, a majority of Americans agreed with him; most1980 opinion polls showed that most Americans opposedmilitary action for fear it would endanger the hostages.   But today, not only do more Americans seem less anxiousabout the fate of their trapped countrymen, some even want tofault the hostages themselves for their plight.   &quot;On almost every talk show I've been on,&quot; Mr. Saba says,&quot;someone calls in and says, `Well, it's their fault for beingin that part of the world in the first place.' There's a lotof this blaming-the-victim business going around. Why havepeople gotten so hardened?&quot;   The much larger number of hostages involved may be onereason. &quot;It's such a big situation and there are so manypeople involved, it's hard to personalize it,&quot; Mr. Saba says.   Mrs. Hale, however, her voice breaking as she speaks, hasno trouble personalizing the situation. For those havingdifficulties, she recommends the following technique: &quot;Maybethey should take a look at their husband or their wife acrossthe dinner table and think how would it feel if they were theones there.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;Americans Support Bush's Tough Stanceon Iraq, Backing Military Action Despite Hostages...&quot; -- WSJSept. 21, 1990)</TEXT></DOC>
