(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The successful introduction of new development methodologies, such as rapidapplications development (RAD), requires careful attention to humanmotivation.andM;Because information-systems (IS) managers often hesitate to learn somethingnew, it's frequently difficult to alter the culture of a large ISorganization.andP;  As a result, the introduction of innovative development lifecycles such as RAD can be alarming and threatening to such organizations.andM;An efficient IS staff today needs to work in an environment of informationengineering, RAD and reusability.andP;  These all require integratedcomputer-aided software engineering (I-CASE) tools with a well-managedrepository.andP;  Thus far, however, many IS shops have not even experimented withthese techniques.andP;  Introducing them represents a revolutionary change in theway an IS organization functions.andM;Such a change requires the total commitment of the top IS executive.andP;  Thisexecutive must fully understand the methodologies described in this seriesand work hard to implement them.andP;  The top IS executive should also have anexcellent rapport with the organization's CEO, who in turn should understandthat the business needs to retool IS.andP;  It is the CEO's responsibility to makesure that the rest of top management understands the urgency of thisretooling.andM;Some of the retooling provides no short-term improvement in profits; itsresults are evident over the long term.andP;  In fact, the payoff from theintroduction of RAD techniques can adversely affect the current year'sprofit.andP;  Management must be aware of the strategic benefits of retooling ISand be willing to make the investment.andM;The IS organizations found to be the most successful in achievinghigh-productivity and fast-development goals were constantly striving toimprove.andP;  In meetings and in casual conversations, people were preoccupiedwith being the best.andP;  This was a common goal.andM;In other IS organizations, this motivation was lacking.andP;  Interchangeableprogrammers came and went, often claiming that CASE tools do not improveproductivity.andM;When we change the world too fast for human comfort, we need to pay carefulattention to human motivation.andP;  This is especially true with the introductionof RAD life cycles.andP;  The champion of RAD should know how best to motivate theusers involved and the IS staff.andP;  The management of cultural change isparticularly important when old methodologies are entrenched in the ISbureaucracy.andM;Individuals usually are motivated by fear, money, prestige, pride andexcitement.andP;  Of these, fear is the least effective in the long run.andP;  Money isthe most expensive.andP;  A sensitive combination of all of these factors isprobably the most effective means of motivation.andM;Perhaps the single most powerful motivator is excitement.andP;  When people areexcited about what they are doing, they work hard for long hours and enjoyit.andP;  RAD leaders should generate the kind of excitement that occurs withfundamental changes.andP;  It should be exciting to be part of the RAD revolution,and to build a mission-critical system that will change the enterprise in arelatively short time.andM;Prestige is another motivator.andP;  Construction teams should be encouraged totake pride in their superior performance.andP;  Individuals should take pride inachieving superior results with the best available tools.andM;The prospects of prestige should encourage non-RAD developers -- or non-CASEdevelopers -- to switch to the new environment.andM;Money, of course, is a universal motivator.andP;  Pay raises should be based onperformance in achieving high speed, productivity and quality.andP;  Organizationsthat don't use financial incentives as a motivation technique suffer abureaucratic obstacle that lowers programmers' performance.andM;What motivates one person may not motivate another.andP;  The answer to thequestion &quot;What's in it for me?&quot; depends on the individual.andP;  The leaders ofthe RAD revolution should identify the most effective way to motivate eachperson involved.andM;When new tools and methodologies are introduced in an IS organization, someprofessionals immediately become enthusiastic about them; others resist andwant to delay their introduction.andP;  It is useful for management to categorizethe professionals into the following groups: experimenters, early adapters,pragmatists, late adapters and resisters.andM;The figure shows the average representation of these types in some ISorganizations and the relative time they take adapting to the newmethodology.andM;Most IS organizations have some experimenters who like to try anything newbut do not necessarily stick with it.andP;  Although the experimenters get excitedabout a new endeavor, they do not always convert their excitement into solidconstruction.andP;  These people often respond well to encouragement.andM;The early adapters see the value of a new methodology and lead the way inmaking it practical.andP;  They adjust the methodology to make it work well intheir environment.andM;The champion of new techniques needs early successes.andP;  To accomplish this, heor she must identify the experimenters and early adapters, since earlysuccesses come about from energetic people excited about learning a new skilland putting it to work to achieve something special.andP;  The champion must formorganizational structures appropriate for the early adapters, motivate themwell and protect their potential achievement from opposition by theresisters.andM;The early adapters should know that if they fail the first time, there willbe no penalty.andP;  People often learn from an early failure.andM;Excitement is an effective way to motivate the early adapters.andP;  There mustalso be a high level of prestige associated with the achievements of theearly adapters.andP;  Management should ensure that their successes are highlyvisible.andM;The pragmatists are the middle-of-the-road developers.andP;  They are cautious offailure and reluctant to spend time learning new methods until they're sureit will be a good investment of their time.andP;  These developers adopt a newmethodology only when the early adapters have demonstrated that it issignificantly better than what currently exists and have demonstratedrepeated success with it.andM;The prestige attached to early accomplishments should be used to persuadepragmatists to learn RAD methods.andM;The late adapters are reluctant to change; they're the old dogs who do notwant to learn new tricks.andP;  Financial incentives may be the best way to seducethem.andM;Disarming TroublemakersandM;The resisters consciously oppose the new methodology, sometimes disguisingtheir negativism in intellectual arguments.andP;  Resisters are present in most ISorganizations and sometimes voice their opposition vigorously from the start.andM;The champion of a new methodology has to know how to deal with the resisters.andO;The worst of them may search for subtle ways to sink the methodology beforeit takes hold.andM;The resisters are the most difficult to motivate.andP;  For them, a subtly applieddose of fear is often the most effective.andP;  If necessary, their power andprestige can be removed.andP;  It may be necessary to move them to a positionwhere they cannot have a negative influence.andM;Next week, I will discuss the techniques that can be used to introduce newdevelopment life cycles, such as RAD, into an IS organization.andM;----------The concepts embodied in RAD are described in a new volume in the JamesMartin Report Series.andP;
