<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-49-0591 </DOCNO><TEXT>The theory for fundamental plasma emission by the three-wave processesL +- S -andgt; T (where L, S and T denote Langmuir, ion sound and transversewaves, respectively) is developed. Kinematic constraints on the characteristicsand growth lengths of waves participating in the wave processes are identified.In addition the rates, path-integrated wave temperatures, and limitson the brightness temperature of the radiation are derived.</TEXT></DOC>
