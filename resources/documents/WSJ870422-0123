Moments earlier the adjacent slope had been dotted with a dozen brown shapes. Now there were only the steadfast cactuses, trees, short grass and scattered stones.    Finding the animals, north Africa's aoudad sheep, had taken two days of slow, sometimes abusive riding over the rugged terrain. The search had culminated in a slow, careful stalk, often on hands and knees. At the sound of the shot a puff of white had risen a mere inch over the aoudad's back, where bullet had met stone instead of sheep. The excitement that had raced through the hunter only seconds before was replaced by disappointment and the hollow feeling of a missed opportunity.    As the two men rode the rock-studded trail the five miles back to their lodgings, the hunter's spirits began to lift with the help of Mr. Seales. There was still one more day left on his hunt; they would be less choosy and the hunter would score. If not an African aoudad, maybe an elegant little black-buck antelope from India or the same country's fawn-spotted, majestic antlered axis deer. They'd sighted plenty of both that day, as well as countless Japanese sika deer and southern European palmate-antlered fallow bucks.    There was a time, only a few decades ago, when such a hunt would have entailed traveling thousands of miles, spending months away from home and business, not to mention substantial capital. But this hunt was taking place on a sprawling 40,000-acre chunk of arid central Texas ground called the Y.O. Ranch. Such animals in such a land used to be considered a novelty -- but not anymore.    &quot;When my father first introduced exotics, black-buck antelope and aoudad sheep about 30 years ago, I think we were only one of three ranches to have them,&quot; said Charles Schreiner IV, general manager of the Y.O. &quot;Now there are probably between 300 and 500 ranches in Texas that have at least a few exotics.&quot;    At first many of the exotics were brought in as novelties. Ranchers also wanted to see if animals from other parts of the world could survive in a land that at times could be devastating to domesticated livestock. Some didn't fare well, but others have thrived.    Herds of at least 15 different species of exotic antelopes, deer, sheep and goats roam the Y.O., easily scraping a living from a land that at first glance could seemingly support little more than its cactuses, cedars and short, dense clusters of live oak. The herds are basically self-sufficient, relying only on man's windmill-filled water tanks. Most have been bringing forth undomesticated offspring for generations.    For decades wildlife management and hunting have been as much a part of the Texas hill country as thick-wooled sheep and lanky beef cattle. &quot;My grandmother first started leasing parts of the ranch to companies for hunting shortly after World War II,&quot; said Mr. Schreiner. &quot;When my father took over the ranch we began offering guided hunts. Hunting can be a main source of income in this region; sometimes it has a higher income potential than running livestock.&quot;    For years hunters from across the country have gone to the Y.O. to pursue the tall-antlered whitetail deer that today abound in astonishing numbers. A great deal of attention has also been given to the native Rio Grande turkeys that at times seem to be as common as Central Park pigeons.    As the herds thrived, hunting the exotics seemed to fall into place. &quot;Interest in hunting the exotics really took off in the late 1970s and it's still there,&quot; said Mr. Schreiner. &quot;For one thing, it's a lot cheaper than traveling to the places where these animals are native. Plus, it gives sportsmen something else to hunt and an extended season. We're open all year and there's always some species that's at its prime.&quot;    Thanks to teeming exotic populations and experienced guides, most exotic ranches have high -- nearly 100% -- success rates. It is the high success rates that lead some to say that hunting the exotics isn't sporting. Most who've done so, however, disagree.    &quot;Hunting exotics is like anything else; you get out of it what you put into it,&quot; said Mr. Seales just minutes after the hunter's third and final day had ended with a successful stalk on an aoudad. &quot;There's really nothing to going out and taking the first animal you see, but if someone holds out for a particular trophy or species, like aoudad, it can be a lot more challenging than hunting whitetails.&quot;    But the effect of adding exotics to the Texas hill country goes much deeper than adding to a struggling economy and creating new opportunities for sportsmen. It is one of those rare arrangements that benefits all involved, including non-hunters and, in many instances, the wildlife itself.    The Texas exotics give those with a deep interest in the world's wildlife a chance to see dozens of species, from all corners of the world, without having to make the trip. Every year the Y.O. hosts hundreds of such tourists. And it's in the arid hill country that some species may find their only refuge. The black-buck antelope, though very common on the exotic ranches, is threatened in its native land, as are several other species.    &quot;The main reason a lot of us are into exotics is for saving some of these species,&quot; said Betty Kelso, chairman of the board of the Texas-based Exotic Wildlife Association. &quot;If there weren't people here raising them I seriously don't know where they'd be.&quot;    &quot;It's all a matter of survival,&quot; added Mr. Schreiner. &quot;Most ranchers make a hell of a lot more money off of exotics than they do cattle, not only from hunting but also from the animals that are sold to zoos, animal parks, and to other places. In return we're making the future more secure for these species by making them economically profitable to man.&quot;    ---   Mr. Pearce is a free-lance outdoors writer based in Manhattan, Kan. </TEXT></DOC>
