(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The power of suggestion has taken on a newmeaning for American corporations as increased competition forcesthem to look for cost-cutting measures from within.   The old employee suggestion box is getting a workout, andcompanies are rewarding innovative ideas handsomely.   The National Association of Suggestion Systems says its 900member companies saved more than $2 billion last year as a resultof their employees' suggestion programs. Workers received a totalof $150 million in award payments for suggestions adopted.   One of those employees was Edward H. Anderson, 51, of YorbaLinda, Calif., who was named the association's ``Suggester of theYear'' at the organization's annual conference in Orlando this week.   Anderson, a scientist for Hughes Aircraft Co., submitted ideasthat resulted in cost-saving improvements totaling $22 million in1987, company officials said.   The company program does not provide for direct financialrewards, but ``there's a direct relationship between yoursuggestions and your salary raises,'' Anderson says.   One of his suggestions saved about 15,000 hours of technicianlabor annually. Another lightened the weight of satellites, cuttingdown on launch costs.   ``When you come up with a really good idea, you know you didsomething important,'' Anderson said Thursday. ``It's my way ofkeeping on top of the Christmas tree.''   Anderson, who works in the materials and process laboratory ofHughes' Space and Communications Group, is a compulsive suggester.In his 14 years of employment, he has submitted 200 ideas, withhalf of them adopted. Hughes said the total cost savings amountedto $75 million.   Runner-up Richard Makaiwi recommended the use of a pneumaticunderground piercing tool for installation of natural gas servicesto customers of Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. in San Jose, Calif.   The suggestion will provide an estimated savings of more than $1million in each of the next five years. It also enriched Makaiwi'sbank account by $25,000.</TEXT></DOC>
