<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-01-1310 </DOCNO><TEXT>It has already been shown that 2-amino-4,6-di(tert-butyl)phenol reactswith 3,5-di(tert-butyl)-o-benzoquinone to form 1H-1-oxo-2,4,6,8-tetrakis(tert-butyl)phenoxazine(I), which is readily reduced by alkali metals to the corresponding semiquinoneanion-radical (II), and further to the diamagnetic dianion (IIA). Theymade use of this ability of (I) to undergo reduction to prepare anion-radicalsalts with different group II-IV metals in the form of their amalgams.In the EPR spectrum of the anion-radical complex (III) formed in thereduction of (I) by a thallium amalgam, the HFI constants of the unpairedelectron with magnetic nuclei of the organic ligand are close to thoseof the K-salt (II), and a substantial HFI is observed with the /sup 203,205/Tlnuclei. This unequivocally proves that the complex has a semiquinonestructure, since an HFI on the /sup 203,205/Tl nuclei of such an orderof magnitude is characteristic of o-benzoquinone salts with a thalliumcation.</TEXT></DOC>
