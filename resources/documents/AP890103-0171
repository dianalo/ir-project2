Ramirez commented after four resistance leaders sent a letter toPresident Oscar Arias of Costa Rica asking for his help in reopeningpeace talks with the Sandinistas.   Arias is the author of a 1987 peace plan for Central America thatcalls, in part, for negotiated solutions to civil conflicts inNicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.   Leaders of the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, said lastweek they would submit negotiation proposals to Central Americanpresidents, due to meet in San Salvador on Jan. 15 in a bid torevive the stalled Central American peace process.   In the letter to Arias, Contra leaders Adolfo Calero, EnriqueBermudez, Roberto Ferrey and Wilfredo Montalvan proposed that talksbegin in Washington on Jan. 25.   President Daniel Ortega on Saturday denounced rebel statementsand said he would not negotiate with the Contras. He has called onthe rebels to lay down arms and accept a government amnesty. Ortegawas in Cuba on Tuesday celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Cubanrevolution.   Ramirez said his government is ready to negotiate with the UnitedStates and to continue the peace process.   The Sandinistas came to power through a revolution in 1979. Theyhave been challenged by the rebels in a civil war that has gone onfor more than seven years and taken more than 50,000 lives.   Most of the fighting stopped when a cease-fire was declared inMarch 1988, but further talks to settle the conflict broke down inSeptember.</TEXT></DOC>
