A historic political reform passed into Soviet law Dec. 1 said,``conditions would be created for nomination of an unlimited numberof candidates'' for the Congress of People's Deputies.   Two-thirds of the 2,250 deputies are to be elected by the generalpublic on March 26. The other third is to be chosen by certainorganizations, including the Communist Party, which has the right tochoose 100 deputies.   The election reform did not say whether the party members wouldvote directly on multiple candidates for their seats, and Kremlinwatchers were waiting for today's plenum to find out.   The official news agency Tass reported that party memberssuggested 31,500 nominees, but these were winnowed down and finallyjust 100 were chosen by the 12-member ruling Politburo. Those 100candidates were nominated by the party's 300-member CentralCommittee today, Tass said.   But rank-and-file party members won't have the chance to vote onthe party's candidates, Tass said. Only party leaders will castballots in a special meeting March 15 and 16, and they will not havea choice of candidates.   Still, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Central Committeehe expects a variety of political platforms to emerge in the publiccampaign. Tass said Gorbachev offered a draft platform to the plenumtoday, but details were not released.   ``The Soviet people are entitled to know the objectives and tasksformulated by the party for the immediate future, and the platformit takes to elections,'' Gorbachev said.   ``We should proceed from the premise that the other socialorganizations will come to the elections with their own campaigndocuments,'' and individual candidates can also offer their views,Gorbachev said.   Gorbachev was referring to other national organizations,including trade unions and scientific groups, which have beenempowered to directly elect deputies to the congress. The CommunistParty is the only legal political party in the Soviet Union.   Gorbachev also expressed satisfaction that most candidatesnominated so far in the three-month election campaign are supportersof his restructuring policy, called perestroika.   Under the political reform he championed, the new congress willmeet once a year to elect a working parliament of 424 members andretaining the name of the old rubber-stamp parliament, the SupremeSoviet.   Tass said that before the party formally elects its 100 deputies,``all Communists will have an opportunity to express their attitudeto any of the candidates.''   Those actually voting for the Communist Party's legislators willbe the members of its Central Committee, its Auditing Commission,first secretaries of the republic and regional party organizations,second secretaries of the republic party organizations, presidentsand prime ministers of the republics, ministers and heads of stateagencies, and commanders of military districts, Tass said.</TEXT></DOC>
