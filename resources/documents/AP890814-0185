This month's test records ability torecall random digits that appear one per second on the screen. Tenis extraordinary; most people remember about seven. Rajan hasrecalled 64.   His is not a photographic memory but a highly structured systemof some sort, Thompson says. ``Rajan has pi stored in a verysystematic way in his brain.''   As photocopied from a textbook, the numbers are organized inblocks of a thousand, with five blocks to a page. ``We'll say, `Giveus the 18,336th digit of pi.''' The time it takes Rajan to searchhis memory for the right thousand block, then the right hundred, andfinally, to pinpoint the number, hints at how these storage andretrieval processes work.   So does the occasional error. ``If he makes a mistake, withoutfail he'll be in exactly the right spot but a thousand digits off.Or, he'll be in the right spot, only 10,000 digits off.'' Rightposition. Wrong page.   A three-year National Institutes of Health grant pays for theresearch and for Rajan's work toward a master's degree inphysiological psychology. ``I want to know what neurons, whatneurochemicals, are responsible for memory.''   The entire project ``could be interesting and fun and yet nottell us a thing,'' Thompson says. ``What we hope is that we'reluckier than that. We hope his memory serves as a magnifying glassto show us how ordinary memory works. That will depend if we'reclever enough and lucky enough to do the right tests. There are ajillion tests.''   As random numbers rush past, Rajan sometimes makes fleetingassociations with formulas learned in physics, chemistry or math,with distances between cities, with zip codes or historic dates. Nowand then, he chuckles softly at some private numerical joke. As thecomputer spits out 1,8,6,5, he murmurs ``Lincoln,'' who wasassassinated that year.   Such connections don't help him remember, he says. They're merelyrandom thoughts that flit through his mind, small points of interestalong the infinite journey through the decimal expansion of pi.   With testing over for another day, Rajan would much ratherdiscuss something else _ his talent for languages, artwork orcooking. A man is more than his memory, no matter how good it is.   ``Thirty years from now, I want to see myself as well-rounded. Iwant to learn more languages, to learn musical instruments, tobecome as accomplished as possible. One way to grow as a human beingis to develop your potential and expand mentally, then to helpothers develop as well.''   After 67 interviews in 56 days, he is tired of performing, tiredof being asked if he could memorize a phone book like Dustin Hoffmanin ``Rain Man,'' tired of explaining he's not an idiot savant.   Rajan's growing celebrity is evident as he lopes along the woodedpaths of the campus, a solitary figure deep in thought, reed-thinwith dark eyes darting restlessly beneath inky curls. He shrugs offhis reverie and responds jovially each time a student approaches tocomment on this TV appearance or that magazine article.   He chose Kansas State for its psychology department as well asits generous financial aid, never imagining how lonely _ howincongruous _ he might feel in a small town in Kansas, no matter howfriendly the town.   ``There are far fewer distractions at KSU than at a UCLA or aColumbia,'' he says philosophically. But he never misses a chance totravel to bigger cities, and the distances are among the numberslocked in his memory: 1,361 miles to New York, 1,294 to Washington;498 to Dallas; 114 to Kansas City.   There are other international students at KSU, but most are men,and it isn't male company he longs for as he trudges back and forthbetween the campus and his bachelor apartment. He shares it withanother Indian student, who's usually at his girlfriend's. ``I'm anincredibly lonely guy,'' Rajan says.   It's hard to tell at Fast Eddy's, the pool hall, where he seemsto greet everyone. For 20 joyful minutes, he stretches gracefullyover a table in the corner. His lanky arms send balls crashing asDave Jenson watches approvingly.   The regulars know all about Rajan's memory but ``we try not totalk about it,'' says Jenson, the owner's son. ``We take things instride.''   Later, Rajan finds refuge with best friend Ruth Ridder, who feelsa kinship based on her own British upbringing. Ruth, husband Tonyand 3-year-old Hannah are ``my American family,'' he says. He andRuth take turns cooking each other Indian meals in her kitchen,where his memory is as irrelevant as a trick knee.   ``He's funny, he's generous with his time and his finances. He'salso unreliable, forgetful and annoying in lots of ways...He forgetsour phone number constantly,'' Ruth says.   ``When it comes to his memory, I'm in the what's-the-pointcategory. I worry for him. He has a million acquaintances but he'slonely. Too many people try to make him a performing animal. We trynot to talk about it.''   In spite of himself, Rajan sometimes uses his memory to drawpeople to him. Once, he got a woman at the cafe to give him 57random numbers.   ``He drank two cappuccinos, read Interview magazine from cover tocover, and discussed the ill way we treat Nicaragua,'' Tony Ridderrecalls. ``Then he repeated them to her. Backwards.''   Rajan admits to having hustled the occasional beer _ a beer he'dbarely touch _ but says that's all in the past. These days heconfines his wizardry to the lab ``so as not to contaminate theresearch.''   Besides, ``Nobody will touch me with a barge pole.''   Tonight it's his turn to cook, and he arrives at Ruth's ladenwith spices from the international market. He chases everyone intothe living room, strips off his shirt and spends the next hour alonein the kitchen, shrouded in steam.   ``I close my eyes and I'm back at my mother's table eatingsupper,'' he says, lost in a memory not of numbers but of how itfeels to belong.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 27</NOTE></DOC>
