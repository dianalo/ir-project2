According to the report, 83% of the population will be a victim of violent crime at least once in their lifetime. And four out of 10 Americans will be injured in a robbery or assault.    Crimes against property are even more common; 99% of the population will be a victim of theft at least once, according to the government, and 87% will have property stolen three or more times. In most categories, the chances of being a victim are much higher for blacks than for whites.    When do crimes occur? There are marked seasonal trends, according to the report, with most crimes taking place on summer nights and the fewest in the dead of winter.    No New Identity   For Life Insurance   IF A PERSON receives a new identity under the Federal Witness Protection Program, who is he legally? At least when it comes to life insurance, he's exactly who Uncle Sam says he is -- regardless of anything he did under a previous name.    That's what a federal judge has decided in the bizarre case of Miami investor Arthur Kane, who killed a Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. branch manager in the wake of Black Monday last October. Mr. Kane also wounded his stockbroker and then turned his gun on himself.    Mr. Kane, it turned out, had left his wife $1.5 million in life-insurance benefits. But it also turned out that Mr. Kane had not one life, but two. Before becoming Arthur Kane, he had been Arthur Katz and had been convicted of insurance fraud. He had obtained his new identity through the federal government after helping convict 20 defendants, including an associate of organized-crime figure Meyer Lansky, in a celebrated stock-manipulation case.    Learning of his past life, two insurance companies asked a federal judge to void the policies, arguing fraudulent misrepresentation. They said that Mr. Kane had failed to disclose that he was a person with a criminal past and that his life had been threatened. Therefore, they claimed that they didn't have to pay, even though the policies had incontestability clauses.    But U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings said Mr. Kane hadn't misrepresented himself because &quot;his new identity was legally sanctioned.&quot;    The judge pointed out that disclosing a protected witness's former identity would undermine the purpose of the witness program -- and &quot;his life could conceivably have been more at risk, not less.&quot;    Moreover, Judge Hastings said, an incontestability clause in an insurance policy is, with rare exception, just that -- incontestable.    If All Else Fails,   Blame the Judge   WHEN LAWYERS have the facts on their side, they usually argue the facts. If the facts look bad but the law seems to favor them, they ignore the facts and argue the law.    And then there are the times when they go after the judge.    So it went in California, where a state appeals court recently reversed a $26 million lender-liability judgment against BankAmerica Corp. that had been won by a group of apple growers and processors. The two law firms representing the apple interests are now seeking to overturn the ruling of the three-judge panel by alleging that the members of the panel were biased in BankAmerica's favor.    Their argument: The three judges covet federal judgeships -- and they think that BankAmerica's lawyer, prominent Democrat Warren Christopher, might help them get anointed in a Dukakis administration.    The apple growers' lawyers also charged that the judges had other conflicts. The panel declined a bid to step aside, and now the matter is before the state supreme court.    Mr. Christopher, chairman of the Los Angeles firm of O'Melveny andamp; Myers, declines comment, but his court memorandum says the charges are in &quot;shocking disregard&quot; of legal ethics rules.    Meanwhile, the plaintiffs' attorneys say they owe it to their clients to push every argument. But they recognize the risks. Says San Francisco attorney William Lukens, who made the allegation involving Mr. Christopher: &quot;I know my career is down the drain with that group&quot; of judges.    Sandamp;Ls Pay Up Front --   First in Case   DIRECTORS OF troubled savings and loans have seized on a creative way to make sure there's enough money in the till to pay their often-staggering legal bills.    Thrifts have been paying advance retainers -- often in the hundreds of thousands of dollars -- to their law firms. In some cases, the Sandamp;Ls are setting up trust funds for legal fees to be administered by their lawyers. In the past year, one Memphis, Tenn., law firm -- Higgins andamp; Associates -- has set up more than a dozen of such funds.    The Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp., however, seems to be catching on to the strategy. Jack Smith, deputy general counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which controls FSLIC, says that if an Sandamp;L knows it is about to go into receivership and sets up such a fund to avoid an asset freeze, FSLIC will contest it in court.    FSLIC won a case in February to recover $500,000 from two law firms that had accepted advances from an Sandamp;L that later failed. &quot;We oppose the retention of money by a law firm after a bank is in receivership,&quot; says Mr. Smith, &quot;and we'll go after that money.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
