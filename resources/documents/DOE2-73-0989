Of all patients receiving PCI, 17% developedneurotoxicity, and of those receiving PCI and surviving greater thanor equal to 1.5 years, 37% suffered neurologic sequelae. In those receivingPCI but surviving less than 1.5 years, the incidence of neurotoxicitywas 4%. The mean time interval between the end of PCI and the onset ofneurotoxicity was 17 months (range 2-63 months). The PCI dose rangedfrom 2600-3600 cGy. None of the patients not receiving PCI developedneurotoxicity. The incidence of neurotoxicity in long-term survivors(greater than or equal to 1.5 years) with respect to PCI dose was lessthan or equal to 3000 cGy (25%), 3200 cGy (56%), 3600 cGy (36%). Almostall of the patients getting PCI also received lomustine, an agent associatedwith DNA repair inhibition and synergism with DNA damaging agents suchas ionizing radiation or alkylating agents. Under the conditions of ourstudy, PCI was associated with an unacceptable risk of neurotoxicity.Until further information is forthcoming, one should proceed with cautionwhen using PCI in conjunction with lomustine.</TEXT></DOC>
