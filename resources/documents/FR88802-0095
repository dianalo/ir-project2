L. 100-368 (formerly H.R.3893), an amendment to AHERA. The primary provision of the amendment providesan LEA with the opportunity to request a deferral to May 9, 1989 for thesubmission of its asbestos management plan to the State Governor if itis unable to provide the plan by the original due date of October 12, 1988.The requirement for submission of management plans for asbestos in schoolscomes from the original AHERA, signed into law October 22, 1986. UnderAHERA, EPA issued the AHERA schools rule, which requires LEAs to inspectfor and to manage asbestos-containing materials in their schools. The AHERAschools rule was published at pages 41826-41898 of volume 52 of the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>and is codified at 40 CFR Part 763.Under the amendment, EPA is required to notify LEAs of the opportunityto request deferrals and to provide a list of offices in each State towhich deferral requests should be sent. (The State offices are listed inUnit VIII. below.) EPA is providing notification though this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice and a subsequent direct mailing to individualLEAs.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. How the Deferral Process Works</ITAG>A. School SubmissionAn LEA may request, from its Governor, a deferral to May 9, 1989, for submissionof a management plan to the State. The request may cover one or more schoolsand must include a list of all schools covered by the request.The LEA must make certain assurances in its deferral request that requirementsspecified by the amendment have been met. (The required assurances arelisted in Unit III. below.)Before filing a deferral request, the LEA shall notify affected parent,teacher, and employee organizations of its intent to file, and in the caseof a public school, the LEA shall discuss the request at a public meetingof the school board. The deferral request must be filed with the Stateby October 12, 1988_the original due date for plan submission under AHERA.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. State Review</ITAG>Within 30 days after receipt of a deferral request, the Governor shallrespond to the LEA in writing to acknowledge whether the deferral requestis complete or incomplete. If incomplete, the Governor must identify inthe response the items which are missing from the request. The LEA maycorrect and refile its request with the Governor not later than 15 daysafter it has received a response from the Governor.Only when a deferral request is accepted as complete and acknowledged inwriting by the State, has the deferral been granted.An LEA whose deferral request has been approved must submit a managementplan to the Governor not later than May 9, 1989. (The submission must includea copy of the deferral request and the appropriate assurances accompanyingthe request, as discussed in Unit III. below.) The Governor must reviewthe deferred management plan in accordance with the applicable standardsfor review of management plans under the original AHERA. There is one exception,however. Under the original law, the Governor could extend the 30-day periodunder which an LEA may revise a disapproved plan for an additional 90 days.Under the new law, the Governor may extend the 30-day revision period onlyfor an additional 30 days.LEAs are still required to begin implementation of their management plansby July 9, 1989, as originally specified in AHERA and the AHERA schoolsrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. LEA Assurances Required for Deferrals</ITAG>The amendment creates two categories of LEA deferrals, with assurancesspecified for each category. The first category (Category A) applies toLEAs in States which have, before June 1, 1988, requested waivers fromAHERA under 40 CFR 763.98. These States are Connecticut, Illinois, NewJersey, and Rhode Island. The second Category (Category B) applies to LEAsin all other States. Many of the activities associated with these deferralassurances must be completed before October 12, 1988.A. Category A DeferralsOnly LEAs in Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, and Rhode Island may seeka deferral under Category A. (These States have requested waivers underthe AHERA schools rule for their own State programs by June 1, 1988.)The amendment requires two assurances for Category A deferrals, which maybe made in a single statement:1. <T3>Assurance 1: </T3>That the State in which the LEA is located has requesteda waiver from EPA before June 1, 1988.2. <T3>Assurance 2:</T3> That the LEA has carried out the notification ofaffected groups and in the case of a public school, that the LEA has conductedthe public meeting required by the amendment. The amendment requires thatbefore filing a deferral request, an LEA must notify affected school (parent,teacher, and employee) organizations of its intent. Further, in the caseof a public school, the LEA must discuss the request at a public meetingof the school board. Affected school organizations must be notified inadvance of the meeting's time and place.B. Category B DeferralsThe amendment requires four assurances for Category B deferrals.1. <T3>Assurance 1: </T3>A statement and brief explanation why the LEA, despitegood faith efforts, will not be able to meet the original October 12, 1988,deadline for submittal of its management plan.2. <T3>Assurance 2: </T3>A statement that the LEA has made at least one ofthe following documents available for inspection at each school for whicha deferral is sought:a. A solicitation by the LEA to contract with an accredited asbestos contractorfor inspection or management plan development.b. A letter certifying that school district personnel are enrolled in anEPA-approved training course for inspection and management plan development.c. Documentation showing that suspected asbestos-containing material fromthe school is being analyzed at an accredited laboratory.d. Documentation showing that an inspection or management plan has beencompleted in at least one other school under the LEA's authority.3. <T3>Assurance 3:</T3> A statement giving assurance that the LEA has carriedout notification of affected groups and, in the case of a public school,a public meeting. (Again, the new law requires that before filing a deferralrequest, an LEA shall notify affected parent, teacher, and employee organizationsof its intent to file its request. In the case of a public school, theLEA shall discuss the request at a public meeting of the school board,and affected organizations shall be notified in advance of the time andplace of the meeting.) 4. <T3>Assurance 4: </T3>A proposed schedule outlining all significant activitiesleading up to submission of a management plan by May 9, 1989, includingthe inspection of the school. This schedule must contain a deadline ofno later than December 22, 1988, for entering into a contract with an accreditedinspector (unless inspections are to be performed by accredited schoolpersonnel). Laboratory analysis and management plan development must alsobe included in the activity schedule.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Worker Protection Requirements</ITAG>As of October 12, 1988, renovations or removals, with the exception of``emergency repairs,'' are prohibited in schools whose management planshave not completed the AHERA State review process unless:(1) The school is carrying out work with a grant under the EPA's AsbestosSchool Hazard Abatement Act (ASHAA) award program.(2) An inspection that complies with the requirements of the AHERA schoolsrule has been carried out in the school and the LEA complies with key sectionsof the AHERA schools rule: Section 763.90 (g), (h), and (i) on responseactions and Appendix D to Subpart E of Part 763 on transport and disposalof asbestos waste.An ``emergency repair'' is a repair in a school building that was not plannedand was in response to a sudden, unexpected event that threatens eitherthe health or safety of building occupants or the structural integrityof the building.In addition (again, as of October 12, 1988), no operations and maintenance(Oandamp;M) work can occur in schools whose management plans have not receiveda completed State review unless the LEA complies with key sections of theAHERA schools rule: Section 763.91 on Oandamp;M activities, including AppendixB to Subpart E of Part 763, and andSection; 763.92(a)(2) regarding training.Finally, any school employee who conducts emergency repairs involving anymaterial containing asbestos or suspected of containing asbestos or whoconducts Oandamp;M activities must have proper training and equipment tosafely conduct the work in order to prevent potential exposure to asbestos.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Responsibilities of the State</ITAG>The States have two primary responsibilities under the amendment. The firstresponsibility deals with the deferral process, as outlined in Unit II.of this notice. LEAs must understand that only when a deferral requestis accepted as complete and acknowledged in writing by the State, has thedeferral been granted.The second responsibility involves submitting status reports to EPA. Nolater than December 31, 1988, the Governor of each State must submit toEPA a written statement on the status of management plan submissions anddeferral requests received by the State. The list must contain the informationspecified in section 205(e) of the amendment and must be made availableto LEAs in the State. An updated version of the report must be submittedto EPA no later than December 31, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Publication of EPA-Approved Courses</ITAG>EPA must issue each quarter in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, beginning August 31, 1988, a list of trainingcourses approved by EPA for AHERA purposes and laboratories accreditedunder AHERA. The list of training courses, which has been published approximatelyevery 4 months since October 1987, was last published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 1, 1988 (53 FR 20066).<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Penalties for LEAs</ITAG>LEAs are subject to the civil penalties under the original AHERA for violatingworker protection requirements of the amendment, described in Unit IV.above, or for submitting false information in the deferral request. UnderAHERA, LEAs are liable for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 perbuilding for each day during which the violation continues.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John A.
