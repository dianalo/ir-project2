The death squad was ``arguably tied to (El Salvador's)government,'' the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said. The 3-0ruling barred the planned deportation of Wilfredo Mendoza Perez andordered reconsideration of his request for political asylum.   Though the government did not control the death squad, testimonyabout the killings of others who worked for Mendoza's organizationsuggested that people in such groups were in danger, the courtruled.   The threat to Mendoza was specific and real, and persecution wasmore likely than not if he returned to El Salvador, the court said.   ``Given Mendoza's involvement with a land reform organizationand the apparent right-wing death squad, Mendoza's testimony thathis feared persecution is politically motivated finds support inthe record,'' said the opinion by Judge Jerome Farris.   Mendoza testified that he was an accountant with the SalvadoranCommunal Union for almost five years before he left the country andentered the United States illegally in 1982. He said he had beenhelping landless farmers form and manage cooperatives throughoutthe country.   The court decision reversed a Board of Immigration Appealsruling that denied Mendoza's request to stop his deportation. Sinceasylum is at the discretion of the Attorney General, that portionof the case was sent back to the Justice Department for a decision.   Mendoza lives in Phoenix with his wife and children. TheImmigration and Naturalization Service began deportationproceedings after arresting Mendoza about 10 months after hearrived in the U.S.   An INS judge denied Mendoza's request to stop his deportationand receive political asylum. The Board of Immigration Appealsaffirmed that decision in October 1988.   Mendoza said that shortly before he left El Salvador, hereceived a letter threatening him if he did not leave the countrywithin 48 hours. He said officials of the Salvadoran Communal Uniontold him to take the threat seriously.   His attorney, Carolyn P. Blum, called the appeals court'sdecision and Mendoza's prospects for asylum ``exciting andwonderful for him.'' She said the INS board's decision had beenoutrageous.   She said the decision would send a message that the ``people whoactively participate and work with groups in countries like ElSalvador and Guatemala can receive asylum in the United States.''   Philip Waters, acting regional director for the INS in SanFrancisco, declined comment on the case until he and officials inWashington studied the decision.</TEXT></DOC>
