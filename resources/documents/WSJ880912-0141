Such is the case with cocoa these days. The commodity has been described by one analyst as having &quot;the most bearish set of fundamentals of any commodity being traded.&quot;    Consider: There is a record world oversupply of cocoa beans. Current crops are arriving at ports earlier than expected, which indicates not only bumper production but also that they have escaped damage from any bad weather that may come along in the fall. Prices have plunged to 13-year lows.    Moreover, the cocoa agreement that tries to provide some support for the market by buying supplies for its buffer stock is itself in danger of dying. A United Nations agency predicts three more years of surplus production and expressed fear that the agreement won't survive.    Futures traders love dire circumstances like these. They recall that copper was in a similar situation in the early 1980s, only to boom to record prices last year. They think cocoa might be a likely candidate to create &quot;overnight millionaires.&quot;    One of the qualifications to be such a commodity is that the statistical picture of unrelieved gloom applies for the foreseeable future. It has to be such a bearish market that there is virtually no logical hope for a recovery. Then, if a turnaround comes, the traders who guess right become rich and, moreover, legendary for their acumen; man doesn't live by profits alone.    &quot;I've received so many questions about cocoa in that vein recently,&quot; says Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. &quot;But I can't foresee more than a momentary upward (price) blip this fall at best. Over the long term I'm as pessimistic as the rest.&quot;    Ms. Kaul says that, despite record stock levels, good quality cocoa is in tight supply. That's mainly because of the refusal of the Ivory Coast, the world's top producer, to sell at less than a fixed high price. On Friday, however, the Ivory Coast sold some beans at slightly less than the price it had been seeking.    U.S. imports have dropped and consumer stocks of the beans may be low, Ms. Kaul says, while the chocolate industry is entering its peak consumption period. This combination of factors may trigger demand for the hard-to-get good quality beans and prop up their prices somewhat, but beyond that, the current bearish fundamental picture will prevail, she says.    R.E. McMaster Jr., a registered commodity trading adviser in Phoenix, Ariz., says the cocoa market appears to be in the final stages of liquidation now. But he says he'd wait for a sharp drop in the open interest-contracts outstanding that haven't been offset by opposite trades or delivery of the commodity -- before buying into the cocoa market.    &quot;The point at which I would regard the open interest as down sufficiently to encourage me to buy cocoa is a matter of judgment,&quot; he says. &quot;Ideally, there would be, say, a day of active trading, with heavy liquidation both of contracts and open interest and a bounce-back in price. But there could be other circumstances, also.&quot;    In the absence of a big event, he advises caution. &quot;Purchase March or July options -- but only lightly -- and hold them and wait,&quot; he advises.    Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:   Energy   With oil prices at the lowest level in more than a year, traders this week will be watching both the American Petroleum Institute and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    The API's weekly report on U.S. oil statistics due out late tomorrow suddenly has become crucial, at least for futures traders. Will the big drawdowns of crude inventories evident in recent weeks in the U.S. continue? If so, it should revive oil prices, if only briefly. But such a rally could be brief indeed unless there's new evidence that a tentative late-September meeting of OPEC's price-monitoring committee, much in doubt at the weekend, really is going to be held after all.    Barring bullish news, some oil analysts and traders look for West Texas Intermediate crude, currently $14 to $14.50 a barrel, to drop toward $13.50. A few see it headed toward $12-or less.    Interest Rates   Treasury bond futures prices are likely to continue the rally ignited late Friday by the steep drop in oil and gold prices, traders said. But the rally may be short-lived as caution sets in ahead of Wednesday's release of U.S. trade deficit figures for July.    December Treasury bond futures jumped 3/4 to close at 88 15/32, after trading as low as 87 7/16 earlier in the day. Traders said the drop in commodity prices was taken as another indication that inflation fears that have weighed on the fixed-income markets in recent weeks have been exaggerated.    &quot;The fall in oil and gold caught the shorts and forced them to cover&quot; their positions by buying bond futures, said Karen Gibbs, a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. The ensuing price rise triggered further buying from large commodity funds, traders said.    Ms. Gibbs said that Dean Witter predicts a July trade deficit of between $9.9 billion and $13 billion. &quot;Anything above $12 billion is negative for the market,&quot; she said. June's trade deficit was $12.54 billion.    Livestock and Meat   This week the cattle industry will watch for signs that consumer demand for beef is slipping. Since the Labor Day holiday, the high price of beef has spurred consumers to begin buying more pork. Supermarkets are fueling the shift by promoting pork more than beef, said Thomas Morgan, an analyst at Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill.    On Friday, traders expect the Agriculture Department to report that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots for fattening in August declined 5% from a year ago. The department conducts a monthly seven-state census of feedlots. Because of varying estimates of the number of fattened cattle sold to meatpackers in August, analysts are divided over whether the total number of cattle on feedlots increased. </TEXT></DOC>
