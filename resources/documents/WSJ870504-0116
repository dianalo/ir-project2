It sold some of these interest rate-sensitive issues, bought others and returned in a few cases to bottom-fish among issues it took profits in earlier.    With 950,000 accounts and $9.66 billion in assets, Magellan is a closely watched industry leader. And because its portfolio manager, Peter Lynch, has generally outperformed market averages for years, many independent investors take an interest in what Mr. Lynch is buying or selling.    Mr. Lynch says he's maintaining savings and loan institutions, a long-favored group. But he says he's cut back holdings of public money managers. And in the past couple of weeks he's been buying U.S. money-center and regional banks.    Since interest rates started to climb at the end of March, on the whole, &quot;I probably added to interest rate-sensitive stocks -- banks, savings and loans and a few utilities,&quot; he says.    &quot;If interest rates go up dramatically&quot; -- four to five percentage points -- &quot;I think the whole stock market will do poorly. But if they go up slightly, one or two points in the next six months, that shouldn't have an adverse affect on savings and loans and it shouldn't have an adverse impact on bank earnings,&quot; Mr. Lynch says. &quot;The prime rate going up (Friday) is a positive for banks.&quot;    With its sheer size, Magellan can leave a choppy wake for some stocks it leaves behind. Franklin Resources, a mutual fund firm, was one stock in which Magellan took profits recently. In fact, Magellan was previously Franklin's biggest outside shareholder. Franklin's stock has been weak lately, and one of its executives complains that Mr. Lynch &quot;started the whole thing and the stock's been taking gas&quot; since. Of course, mutual fund stocks in general have been in the doldrums lately.    Mr. Lynch says he sold &quot;a lot&quot; of Federal National Mortgage Association, another old favorite, when it was trading in the 40s. But &quot;I still like Fannie Mae. Actually, since it's gone to 38 I like it a lot,&quot; he says.    Mr. Lynch says the biggest change in Magellan this year compared with last is the scaling back of international holdings to 9% from around 20% a year ago. Among those cut were German and British banks. In their stead, Mr. Lynch bought American.    Autos are still a major sector for the fund, but instead of Volvo and Jaguar, it now owns more Ford Motor and Chrysler, raising those positions from sales of the others. Instead of foreign chemical concerns it owns U.S. companies. The fund currently holds about 7% to 8% of assets each in auto, retail and savings and loan sectors. The fund also raised its stake in oils since Dec. 31 to 7% from about 4%.    The giant fund is still beating Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index -- albeit by a small margin. For the year through Friday, Magellan gained 21.4%, nosing past the Sandamp;P's gain of 20.05%, including reinvested dividends, according to Mr. Lynch. He notes that many other managers who run much smaller funds have been underperforming the market.    In the first quarter, Magellan beat the index by a similarly small amount, while last year it was ahead by nine percentage points, doing best at the start of the year.    Mr. Lynch's goal has been to beat the market by four or five percentage points a year on average. And he reminds investors that during the 10 years he's run the fund, it's had seven down periods, when the fund has declined 10% to 20%. Those periods have lasted from six weeks to 27 weeks. But the fund is up nearly 20-fold over the 10 years.    &quot;Some years you have to beat (the Sandamp;P average) by 12 (percentage points) to make up for the years you don't make it, &quot; he says.    &quot;If the public isn't ready for a drop in an aggressive fund, they should be in a bank or a money market fund,&quot; he cautions. If they cash out at a low point in the market rather than accumulating at cheaper prices, &quot;They shouldn't be playing.&quot;    ---   IMPORTED INVESTORS: Two more mutual funds designed for foreign investors were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, bringing the total of such funds on file to 11 so far this year. The two latest funds, Dreyfus U.S. Government International Bond Fund and Van Kampen Merritt Foreign Investors Government Fund, are both structured as limited partnerships aimed at the increasingly weighty overseas assets.    Overall, 54 new products entered the SEC pipeline in April, compared with about 30 a month since January, according to Charles E. Simon andamp; Co., a Washington-based document search firm.    Fidelity Investments filed three limited partnerships that plan to invest in securities denominated in three foreign currencies -- West German marks, British pounds and the Japanese yen. Also, Financial News Network licensed its name to the Financial News Composite Fund, a closed-end fund. </TEXT></DOC>
