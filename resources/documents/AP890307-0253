The president vowed to immediately seek legislation prohibitingsecondary boycotts should the Eastern dispute spill over to otherairlines or railroads. He urged the airline pilots union ``not tomake ... the innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute.''   Meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner appealed toCongress not to force government intervention in the strike byrequiring the administration to impose a 60-day cooling-off period.   ``It is far superior to allow the economic realities of thedispute to dictate the outcome,'' Skinner told the House PublicWorks and Transportation subcommittee on aviation.   Skinner also called on pilots for other carriers not to take anyaction supporting the Eastern strike. The Air Line PilotsAssociation had asked its 40,000 members to closely follow rulesthat could result in slowdowns at major airports.   At the Capitol, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, called on Bush``to provide national leadership'' by convening an emergency boardto help settle the Eastern strike. He said the National MediationBoard has recommended such a panel 33 times in the lasthalf-century, and in each case the president has accepted therecommendation.   ``For President Bush summarily to reject the board'srecommendation and simply let things drift, as he has indicated hisintention to do, would be unprecedented,'' Wright said in astatement he read to reporters.   He said Bush ``can do as previous presidents have done, asPresident Kennedy did in the steel crisis. That's leadership.''   Wright said failure to establish an emergency board and set acooling-off period could at worst be ``a serious blow to theeconomy, the loss of jobs for thousands of Americans and the furtherconcentration of monopoly and erosion of competition in the airlineindustry. The nation cannot now afford such a risk.''   Skinner testified that government action could neither solve thedispute nor save Eastern from bankruptcy. But he said he hoped theairline and union would reach agreement on their own.   The secretary said Eastern flew only 62 of its scheduled 1,057flights on Monday. He said Pan American added 20 flights and Deltafive to make up for the cancelled Eastern routes, but there were 970fewer flights throughout the nation overall because of the shutdown.   The subcommittee is considering a bill that would direct Bush toset up an emergency panel to study issues in the strike. Bush couldveto the measure, but Congress has the power to override hisdisapproval.   If enacted, the bill would stop the strike for at least 60 dayswhile the panel investigates issues on both sides. Bush refused totake that action before the 12:01 a.m. Saturday end of a federallyimposed cooling-off period.   Skinner said a presidential emergency board would be ``whollyinappropriate.''   ``The plain fact of the matter is that a strike at Eastern alonedoes not substantially disrupt this nation's transportationsystem,'' he said. But Skinner said if a boycott of other airlinestakes place, the administration is prepared to introduce a bill tooutlaw such activities.   Skinner said the administration opposes a measure that wouldforce an end to the strike because it believes in free enterpriseand wants to ensure that U.S. industries remain ``as competitive aspossible to maintain our place in the world.''   He said the economic deregulation of transportation has ``reapeduntold benefits.''   The White House has said it might submit a bill that would banEastern Airlines employees from picketing other airlines.   But key Democrats said they would ask the aviation subcommitteetoto give quick approval to legislation directing Bush to set up anemergency panel to study issues in the strike.   The creation of a panel would also compel Eastern for 60 days tocontinue paying salaries in effect prior to the walkout. Theairline, which shut down nearly all its operations on Monday, claimsit was losing $1 million a day and cannot afford to operate without$150 million in annual pay cuts.   Bush followed management urgings in refusing to step in.Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that as long asEastern's striking Machinists union members refrain from picketingother airlines or railways, ``we wouldn't find it necessary to sendup the legislation'' barring such secondary action.   But Fitzwater said the administration is prepared ``to moverapidly to submit the legislation if the secondary boycott occurs.''   The spokesman said Bush is receiving ``daily briefings'' on thesituation and still believes the dispute can best be resolved by thecompany and the union in negotiations rather than through governmentintervention.   But Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., suggested that the emergencypanel legislation he and committee chairman Rep. Glenn Anderson,D-Calif., drew up ``might give cover to the administration'' for theaction Bush refused to take.   Oberstar, aviation subcommittee chairman, did not contend thatthe strike had reached ``emergency'' proportions. But he called itpart of ``a long-term problem with broad implications for theairline industry.''   ``If not an emergency, this is a matter of great publicinterest,'' he said.   Skinner said Monday that the ``private labor dispute should beallowed to follow its normal course'' without boycotts of othercompanies.   ``Both sides need to get this issue resolved and get on with thebusiness of this country and serving its customers,'' Skinner said.   The secretary said he called the heads of other major airlinesand asked them to help passengers affected by Eastern cancellations.</TEXT></DOC>
