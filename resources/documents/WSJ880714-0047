Lloyd Bentsen over Jesse Jackson to be his running mate, but it appears the task may take some time.    During a series of meetings with members of Washington's Democratic establishment, the party's presumptive nominee and Sen. Bentsen played down the possibility of a rift with Mr. Jackson. Mr. Dukakis said he expects Mr. Jackson to be involved in the fall campaign as a &quot;party leader,&quot; and Sen. Bentsen said he has &quot;the highest regard&quot; for the black leader.    But in Atlanta, Ronald Brown, a senior adviser to Mr. Jackson, said the campaign had been &quot;stunned&quot; by Gov. Dukakis's failure personally to inform Mr. Jackson of Sen. Bentsen's selection before the news became known Tuesday morning. Mr. Brown said negotiations between the two camps on the party platform were &quot;on hold&quot; until the governor and Mr. Jackson can talk. And, borrowing a favorite phrase of Mr. Dukakis's, Mr. Brown said a &quot;real partnership&quot; is needed between the two candidates.    Mr. Brown's remarks are significant, not only because of his seniority in the Jackson campaign but also because he is widely viewed as a moderating influence who has worked well with the Dukakis forces. He said that &quot;excellent progress&quot; had been made in the platform talks and that Susan Estrich, Mr. Dukakis's campaign manager, had apologized to him for any embarrassment caused Mr. Jackson.    But by calling a halt to talks, the Jackson campaign appeared to be sending a clear signal that it was dissatisfied with communications between the two principals themselves.    &quot;It has to be a partnership between Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis,&quot; said Mr. Brown, who implicitly criticized past meetings between the two men as more &quot;congenial&quot; than substantive. &quot;We think there are some basic issues that need to be resolved first,&quot; he said. &quot;They have to have an in-depth conversation. They haven't sat down and developed a strategy for the fall campaign.&quot;    Rep. Charles Rangel (D., N.Y.), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, underscored Mr. Brown's comments, saying, &quot;An apology is not enough.&quot; Mr. Rangel said Mr. Dukakis needs to reassure blacks that he values their participation in the party.    Another Black Caucus member, Budget Committee Chairman Rep. William Gray (D., Pa.), who supported Mr. Jackson's presidential bid, praised Mr. Bentsen as an &quot;outstanding public servant&quot; who strengthens the ticket. Mr. Gray urged Democrats to focus their energies on winning the November contest.    Mr. Dukakis himself wasn't apologetic about the process by which he chose his running-mate. He said he had sought to notify Mr. Jackson of his decision as soon as was practical, after Sen. Bentsen had accepted and arrangements could be made for a public announcement. &quot;I'm sorry I didn't get to him on the first try,&quot; he said.    In a speech to wary members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, he stuck to many of his standard campaign pledges to enforce civil rights laws vigorously, pursue full employment policies and better health-care and housing for the poor, and impose sanctions against the white-minority South African government. But he didn't explain why he passed over Mr. Jackson in choosing the Democratic vice-presidential contender.    His remarks received only a cool reception from the mostly black audience which, while polite, saved its warmest responses for references to Mr. Jackson.    NAACP President Benjamin Hooks effectively blunted undercurrents of hostility toward Mr. Dukakis and Sen. Bentsen. He introduced both men warmly, referring to the Massachusetts governor as &quot;as a vigorous and effective chief executive,&quot; and &quot;a man {who} has a heart full of compassion and love and concern.&quot;    Before Messrs. Dukakis and Bentsen arrived at the NAACP convention, Mr. Hooks also demanded the removal of a few hand-lettered signs reading &quot;What's wrong with Jesse?&quot; and &quot;Jesse is qualified,&quot; saying: &quot;Those of you who brought those signs, tear them up and act your age.&quot; A rippling of boos at the introduction of Mr. Bentsen was drowned out by organ music.    But while lauding Mr. Dukakis for his policy record, Mr. Hooks also said to the Massachusetts governor, &quot;Knowing Jesse's been good for you, hasn't it?&quot; Mr. Dukakis smiled and nodded yes.    Later, Ruth Anderson, a professor of social work from the University of Northern Iowa, echoing remarks made by Mr. Bentsen, said, &quot;I will vote for Mr. Dukakis and his vice-presidential choice. I don't have an option; and I don't think most blacks do.&quot;    The Democratic ticket's cool reception by the black members of Congress and the NAACP contrasted with a triumphant reception by the House Democratic Caucus, which received it with cheers and prolonged applause. </TEXT></DOC>
