The guerrillas met Friday in eastern Paktia province at a rebeltraining base about seven miles from the Pakistan border.   The alternative government, announced in February byPakistani-based Afghan rebels, is intended to take power if theSoviet-backed communist regime in Kabul falls.   ``This is the first meeting in a free atmosphere insideAfghanistan,'' rebel leader Rasul Sayyaf, and the designated primeminister of the guerrilla government, said during a news conferencein a hillside bunker.   Hundreds of rebels armed with assault rifles stood guard.Guerrilla forces lined the rocky hills and scanned the sky for enemyairplanes or missiles.   The calm was broken once by a 10-second burst from a hilltopanti-aircraft gun.   President Najib, who leads the Kabul government, on Friday askedthe United States and the Soviet Union to help stop fierce guerrillaattacks on Jalalabad and other eastern cities, the BritishBroadcasting Corp. said, monitoring Kabul radio.   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported ``fiercefighting'' around the Jalalabad airport this week, with the rebelslaunching artillery shells, missiles and anti-tank guided missilesat Afghan army positions. Government troops responded withconcentrated bombing.   Government casualties apparently were heavy. Tass reported thatreinforcements ``making up for recent losses in manpower'' broughtthe Jalalabad garrison to 15,000 troops.   Tass also said rebel leaders have ordered a massive coordinatedshelling attack on all large cities and supply routes. It alsoreported shelling of the Kabul airport.   Attending Friday's rebel meeting were guerrilla leaders NabiMohammadi, declared the interim president, Sayyaf and several otherCabinet ministers. All belong to the seven-party rebel alliancebased in Peshawar, Pakistan.   Afghan rebels based in Iran, mainly Shiite Moslems, so far haverejected the interim regime which is composed mainly of SunniMoslems.   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islamirebels based in Pakistan, recently went to Iran in a new attempt topersuade them to join in.   Sayyaf said he was optimistic. ``The talks were hopeful,promising,'' he said. ``We hope that in a week or 10 days ourproblem will be solved.''   Sayyaf declined to disclose details of Friday's cabinet meetingbut said they would meet again soon ``closer to Kabul.'' He saidthat once all the cabinet posts are filled his government wouldbegin laying groundwork for elections.   Soviet forces ended nine years of involvement in the Afghan waron Feb. 15. They left the country's key cities in the hands of Kabulgovernment troops, but insurgents control the countryside.   The rebels' interim government has pledged to hold nationalelections within six months as a step toward forming a Parliamentand drafting the constitution of a post-war Islamic republic.However, their efforts have been hindered by a power strugglebetween moderates and fundamentalist extremists.</TEXT></DOC>
