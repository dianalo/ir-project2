USAir acquired San Diego-based PSA last year but held off merging it into USAir until April 1988. In the interim, flight attendants formerly employed by PSA have been working under the terms of their former agreement.    The company also said a tentative agreement was reached on a new labor agreement covering all USAir flight attendants, which is amendable next Thursday. Both of these agreements are subject to membership ratification, USAir said. </TEXT></DOC>
