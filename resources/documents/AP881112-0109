Dubcek is scheduled to give the speech Sunday at a ceremony inwhich he will be honored for the reforms he introduced in 1968during a period that became known as the ``Prague Spring.''   He is on his first visit abroad since he was stripped of hisCommunist Party membership in 1970, and he has expressed concern thegovernment might not let him return home because of his statementsin Italy.   Speaking of the invasion in 1968 that crushed his reforms andestablished a hardline government, Dubcek said in his preparedspeech:   ``It is my firm conviction that without the external interventionin the situation of our party and our Czechoslovak society, ourendeavor would have been crowned with success.''   Dubcek is to receive an honorary degree in political scienceSunday from the University of Bologna, which is marking its 900thbirthday. The university made his speech available Saturday.   Dubcek lamented the invasion but expressed hope thatCzechoslovakia will again try to introduce elements of democracy.   ``It would be enough to have a great popular leap, which amongother things, was our movement of rebirth in 1968, in order that ourhistorical experiences so profoundly lived return to the surface andbe openly manifested,'' he wrote.   Dubcek, who considers himself a communist although he wasstripped of party membership, said the last two decades inCzechoslovakia were years of ``economic stagnation, sterility andincalculable moral losses.''   But he added he still had hope, saying: ``We are searching forsomething that can open the path to new developments of socialism _theoretical and practical.''   ``In the Prague Spring, in its internal development and in itssuffocation by external forces, everything is reflected in condensedform _ the crises and the possibilities of socialism,'' his speechdeclared. ``In 1968 we learned that the key to overcome the crisisdoesn't only come in the economic sphere ... the key was, andremains, in the political sphere.''   The 66-year-old Dubcek arrived in Bologna Friday by car. He livesin Bratislava and is retired from a lowly job in a forestrydepartment office that was assigned to him 18 years ago.   Dubcek served for five months in 1970 as Czechoslovakia'sambassador to Turkey but then was summoned back to Prague and oustedhim from the party. He had been removed as party leader in April1969.   Dubcek is expected to remain about 10 days in Italy visitingFlorence, Venice, Ravenna and possibly Rome. No schedule has beenreleased.</TEXT></DOC>
