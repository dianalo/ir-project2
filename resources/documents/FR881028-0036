These regulations revise theprocess for designation of research reserves. Greater emphasis is placedon the use of reserves to address national estuarine research and managementissues, and to make maximum use of the System for research purposes throughcoordination with other elements within NOAA and with other Federal andstate agencies which are sponsoring estuarine research. Additional emphasisis also given to providing financial assistance to states to enhance publicawareness and understanding of estuarine areas by provding opportunitiesfor public education and interpretation. The regulations provide new guidancefor delineating reserve boundaries and new procedures for arriving at themost effective and least costly approach to acquisition land.

The System has been operating under National Estuarine Program regulationspublished June 27, 1984 (49 FR 26502). Based on experience in operatingthe System and on the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) amendments effectivein April 1986, a number of changes in operating procedures and policy arerequired The proposed regulations implement these changes, which include:<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Changing the Name and Emphasis of the Program</ITAG>The CZMA amendments established the National Estuarine Program System (System).The System consists of (1) Each estuarine sanctuary designated before enactmentof the Coastal Zone Management Reauthorization Act of 1985, and (2) eachestuarine area designated as a national estuarine research reserve undersubsection 921.30 of these regulations. The term estuarine sanctuary nolonger appears in regulations; the term research reserve or reserve appearsin its place.The Mission Statement for the System is much the same as for the NationalEstuarine Sanctuary Program. However, the goals for the National EstuarineReserve Research System stress the use of reserve sites for promotion andcoordination of estuarine research on a national level as the highest priorityand reason for establishing the System. The protection and management ofestuarine areas and resources are clearly intended to support the researchmission, not as ends in themselves. Consultation with other Federal andstate agencies to promote use of one or more reserves within the Systemby such agencies when conducting estuarine research is also a clearly definedgoal of the System. The regulations also emphasize using a reserve's naturalresources and ecology to enhance public awareness and understanding ofestuarine areas, and providing suitable opportunities for public educationand interpretation. This education goal has been elevated to become oneof the essential criteria for designation of a reserve.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Revision of the Procedures for Selecting, Designating and OperatingNational Estuarine Research Reserves</ITAG>(A) <T3>Revision of designation criteria. </T3>The Coastal Zone ManagementReauthorization Act of 1985 established, for the first time, statutorycriteria for designating an area as a national estuarine research reserve.An area may be designated by the Secretary of Commerce if:``(1) The Governor of the coastal state in which the area is located nominatesthe area for that designation; and(2) The Secretary of Commerce finds that:(A) The area is a representative estuarine ecosystem that is suitable forlong-term research and contributes to the biogeographical and typologicalbalance of the System;(B) The law of the coastal state provides long-term protection for reserveresources to ensure a stable environment for research;(C) Designation of the area as a reserve will serve to enhance public awarenessand understanding of estuarine areas, and provide suitable opportunitiesfor public education and interpretation; and(D) The coastal state in which the area is located has complied with therequirements of any regulations issued by the Secretary to implement thissection.''Some of these criteria for designation are either new or substantiallymore specific than those contained in the existing regulations. For example,the Governor in a coastal state must nominate an estuarine area for designation,and findings are required that the law of the coastal state provides long-termprotection for reserve resources to ensure a stable environment for researchand that designation of the area will serve to enhance public awarenessand understanding of estuarine areas. The criteria in the existing regulationshave been revised accordingly.(B) <T3>Revision of site selection criteria and procedures. </T3>The criteriafor selecting an estuarine area for designation as a national estuarineresearch reserve have been expanded to provide guidance for determiningboundaries for the proposed site. The Office of Inspector General ReportNo. F-726-5-010 criticized the lack of specific guidelines for settinglimits on boundaries around estuarine sanctuaries to ensure that only landessential to the mission of the program be included inside the sanctuary.References in the existing regulations to ensure that the boundaries encompassan adequate portion of the key land and water areas of the natural systemto approximate an ecological unit are too vague, particularly since termsare not defined. The proposed regulations define key land and water areasas a ``core area'' within the reserve which is so vital to the functioningof the estuarine ecosystem that it must be under a level of control sufficientto ensure the long-term viability of the reserve for research on naturalprocesses. The determination of key land and water areas must be basedon scientific knowledge of the area. The concept of a ``buffer'' area toprotect the core area and provide additional protection for estuarine-dependentspecies has also been defined in the regulations. The buffer zone may includean area necessary for facilities required for research and interpretation,and additionally, to accommodate a shift of the core area as a result ofbiological, ecological or geomorphological change which reasonable couldbe expected to occur. States will be required to use scientific criteriato justify the boundaries selected for a proposed site.The information requirements for NOAA approval of a proposed site underexisting regulations were confusing and now have been clarified.NOAA has recognized the need to conduct studies to develop a basic descriptionof the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the site.As a result, states may now be eligible for Federal funding of these studiesafter NOAA approval of a proposed site.(C) <T3>Management plan development. </T3>Once NOAA approves the proposed siteand decides to proceed with designation, the state must develop a draftmanagement plan. The contents of the plan, including the memorandum ofunderstanding (MOU) between NOAA and the state, are specified in the regulations.The acquisition portion of the plan has been greatly expanded to implementrecommendations in the Office of Inspector General Report No. F-726-5-010.It is proposed that states be required to justify the use of fee simpleacquisition methods and make greater use of non-fee simple methods to conserveexpenditure of funds. For each parcel, both in the core area and the bufferzone, states must determine, with appropriate justification: (1) The minimumlevel of control(s) required, (2) the level of existing state control,and (3) the level of additional state control(s) required; states mustalso examine all reasonable alternatives for attaining the additional levelof control required, perform a cost analysis of each, and rank, in orderof cost, the alternative methods of acquisition which were considered.The cost-effectiveness assessment must also compare short-term and long-termcosts. The state shall give priority consideration to the least costlymethod(s) of attaining the minimum level of long-term control required.(D) <T3>Financial assistance awards for site selection and post site selection.</T3>The first five types of awards under the National Estuarine ReserveResearch System is for site selection and post-site selection, which includespreparation of a draft management plan (including MOU) and the collectionof information necessary for preparation of the environmental impact statement.The maximum total Federal share of these awards has been raised to $100,000.Of this amount, up to $25,000 may be used to conduct the site selectionprocess as described in andSection; 921.11. After NOAA's approval of a proposedsite and decision to proceed with the designation process, the state mayexpend: (1) Up to $40,000 of this amount to develop the draft managementplan and collect information for preparation of the environmental impactstatement; and (2) up to the remainer of available funds to conduct studiesto develop a basic description of the physical, chemical, and biologicalcharacteristics of the site.(E) <T3>Financial assistance awards for acquisition, development, and initialmanagement. </T3>The regulations divide eligibility for financial assistanceawards for acquisition and development into two phases. In the initialphase, states are working to meet the criteria required for formal researchreserve designation, i.e., establishing adequate state control over keyland and water areas in accordance with the draft management plan and preparinga final management plan. In this pre-designation phase, funds are availablefor acquiring interest in land, which is the primary purpose of this award,and for minor construction (e.g., nature trails and boat ramps), preparationof architectual and engineering plans and specifications, development ofthe final management plan, and hiring a reserve manager and other staffas necessary to implement the NOAA approved draft management plan.The length of time for this initial phase of acquisition and developmentmay be up to three years. After the site receives Federal designation asa national estuarine research reserve, the state may request additionalfinancial assistance to acquire additional property interests (e.g., forthe buffer zone), for construction of research and interpretive facilities,and for restorative activities in accordance with the approved final managementplan.The Coastal Zone Management Reauthorization Act of 1985 specifies thatthe amount of financial assistance provided with respect to the acquisitionof land and waters, or interests therein, for any one national estuarineresearch reserve may not exceed 50 per centum of the costs of the lands,waters, and interests therein or $4,000,000, whichever amount is less.The amount of Federal financial assistance provided under the regulationsfor development costs directly associated with major facility construction(i.e., other than land acquisition) for any one national estuarine researchreserve must not exceed 50 per centum of the costs of such constructionor $1,000,000, whichever amount is less.(F) <T3>Financial assistance awards for operation and management. </T3>Theamount of Federal financial assistance available to a state to manage thereserve and operate programs consistent with the mission and goals of theNational Estuarine Reserve Research System has been raised to $420,000.Of this amount, no more than $70,000 may be requested in a twelve monthperiod, allowing for a period of Federal assistance for operation of managementassistance of six years of more. Up to ten percent of the total award (Federaland state) each year may be used for construction-type activities.A time limit has been imposed on the expenditure of operations and managementawards for personnel positions. The Federal portion of operations and managementawards may be used for the support of any single staff position (e.g.,reserve manager, assistant manager, research coordinator, education/interpretivecoordinator, secretary/administrative assistant, custodial support, ortheir equivalents) for a period not exceeding three years. The intent ofthis provision is to ensure that the state makes a longterm commitmentof resources to staff the reserve adequately, well in advance of the periodwhen Federal funding for operation and management is terminated.(G) <T3>Financial assistance for research. </T3>The CZM Reauthorization Actof 1985 specifically affects the conduct of the System's research programby establishing the requirement for developing Estuarine Research Guidelinesand specifying what these guidelines shall include. The legislation alsorequires the Secretary of Commerce to require that NOAA, in conductingor supporting estuarine research, give priority consideration to researchthat uses reserves in the System, and that NOAA consult with other Federaland state agencies to promote use of one or more reserves by such agencieswhen conducting estuarine research.The research guidelines, which are referred to in regulations, but arenot part of them, state that NOAA will provide research grants only forproposals which address research questions and coastal management issuesthat have highest national priority as determined by NOAA, in consultationwith prominent members of the estuarine research community.One significant addition to the regulations is that research awards areavailable on a competitive basis to any coastal state or qualified publicor private person, thus making it possible for the first time for publicor private persons, organizations or institutions to compete with coastalstates and coastal state universities for NOAA research funding to workin research reserves.(H) <T3>Financial assistance awards for interpretation and education. </T3>TheCZM Reauthorization Act of 1985 authorizes the award of grants for thepurposes of conducting educational and interpretive activities. To stimulatethe development of innovative or creative interpretive and educationalprojects and materials which will enhance public awareness and understandingof estuarine areas, the regulations provide for funds to be available ona competitive basis to any coastal state entity. These funds are providedin addition to any other funds available to a coastal state under theseregulations.Categories of potential educational and interpretive projects include:(1) Design, development and distribution/placement of interpretive or educationalmedia (i.e., the development of tangible items such as exhibits/displays,publications, posters, signs, audio-visuals, computer software, and maps,which have an educational or interpretive purpose, and techniques for makingavailable or locating information concerning reserve resources, activities,or issues);(2) Development and presentation of curricula, workshops, lectures, seminars,and other structured programs or presenatations for on-site facility orfield use;(3) Extension/outreach programs; or(4) Creative and innovative methods and technologies for implementing interpretiveor educational projects.Interpretive and educational projects may be oriented to one or more researchreserves or the entire System. Those projects which would benefit morethan one research reserve, and, if practical, the entire National EstuarineReserve Research System, shall receive priority consideration for funding.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Other actions associated with the proposed rulemaking</ITAG>(A) <T3>Classification under executive order 12291. </T3>NOAA has concludedthat these regulations are not major because they will not result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers; indiviudal industries;Federal, state, or local government agencies; or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.These proposed rules amend existing procedures for identifying, designating,and managing national estuarine research reserves in accordance with theCZM Reauthorization Act of 1985. They will not result in any direct economicor environmental effects nor will they lead to any major indirect economicor environmental impacts.(B) <T3>Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis. </T3>A Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis is not required for this notice of proposed rulemaking. The regulationsset forth procedures for identifying and designating national estuarineresearch reserves, and managing sites once designated. These rules do notdirectly affect ``small government jurisdictions'' as defined by Pub. L.96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and the rules will have no effecton small businesses.(C) <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. </T3>This rule contains collectionof information requirements subject to Pub. L. 96-511, the Paperwork ReductionAct (PRA), which have already been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget (approval number 0648-0121) for use through October 31, 1989.Public reporting burden for the collections of information contained inthis rule is estimated to average 2,012 hours per response for managementplans and related documentation, 1.25 hours for performance reports, and15 hours for annual reports and work plans. These estimates include thetime for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any otheraspect of these collections of information, including suggestions for reducingthis burden, to Richard Roberts; Room 1235; Department of Commerce; Washington,DC; 20230; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs; Officeof Management and Budget; Washington, DC; 20503.(D) <T3>Executive Order 12612. </T3>This rule does not contain policies withsufficient Federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalismassessment under Executive Order 12612.(E) <T3>National Environmental Policy Act. </T3>NOAA has concluded that publicationof the proposed rules does not constitute a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, an environmentalimpact statement is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 921</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Coastal zone, Environmental protection,Natural resources, and Wetlands.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas J.

Estuarine research reserves areestablished to provide opportunities for long-term research, education,and interpretation.  (b) The goals of the System for carrying out this mission are to:  (1) Ensure a stable environment for research through long-term protectionof estuarine reserve resources;  (2) Address coastal management issues identified as significant throughcoordinated estuarine research within the System;  (3) Enhance public awareness and understanding of the estuarine environmentand provide suitable opportunities for public education and interpretation; (4) Promote Federal, state, public and private use of one or more reserveswithin the System when such entities conduct estuarine research; and  (5) Conduct and coordinate estuarine research within the System, gatheringand making available information necessary for improved understanding andmanagement of estuarine areas;  (c) National estuarine research reserves shall be open to the public. Multipleuses are allowed to the degree compatible with the research reserve's overallpurpose as provided in the management plan (see andSection;921.12) and consistentwith paragraphs (a) and (b), of this section. Use levels are set by theindividual state and analyzed in the management plan. The research reservemanagement plan shall describe the uses and establish priorities amongthese uses. The plan shall identify uses requiring a state permit, as wellas areas where uses are encouraged or prohibited. Consistent with resourceprotection and research objectives, public access may be restricted tocertain areas within a research reserve.  (d) Certain manipulative research activities may be allowed on a limitedbasis, but only if specified in the management plan and only if the activityis consistent with overall reserve purposes and the reserve resources areprotected. Manipulative research activities with a significant or long-termimpact on reserve resources require the prior approval of the state andthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Habitat manipulationfor resource management purposes is not permitted within national estuarineresearch reserves.  (e) While the intent of establishing national estuarine research reservesis the protection of natural pristine estuarine sites for research, educationaland interpretive purposes, NOAA recognizes that many estuarine areas haveundergone ecological change as a result of human activities. Although restorationof degraded areas is not a primary purpose of the System, some restorativeactivities may be permitted in an estuarine research reserve as specifiedin the management plan.  (f) NOAA may provide financial assistance to coastal states, not to exceed50 percent of all actual costs, to assist in the acquisition, developmentand operation of, and the conduct of educational or interpretive activitiesconcerning, national estuarine research reserves (see Subpart H). NOAAmay provide financial assistance to any coastal state or public or privateperson, not to exceed 50 percent of all actual costs, to support researchand monitoring within a national estuarine research reserve. Five typesof awards are available under the National Estuarine Reserve Research System.The predesignation awards are for site selection, draft management planpreparation and conduct of basic characterization studies. The acquisitionand development award is intended primarily for acquisition of interestsin land and construction. The operation and management award provides fundsto assist in implementing the research, educational, and administrativeprograms detailed in the research reserve management plan. At the conclusionof Federal financial assistance for operation and management, funding forthe long-term operation of the research reserve becomes the responsibilityof the state. The research award provides funds to conduct estuarine researchand monitoring within the System. The educational and interpretive awardprovides funds to conduct estuarine educational and interpretive activitieswithin the System.  (g) Lands already in protected status managed by other Federal agencies,state or local governments, or private organizations can be included withinnational estuarine research reserves only if the managing entity commitsto long-term non-manipulative management. Federal lands already in protectedstatus cannot comprise the key land and water areas of a research reserve(see andSection; 921.11(c)(3)).  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;921.2  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.  </ITAG>(a) ``Act'' means the Coastal Zone Management Act, as amended, 16 U.S.C.1451 <T3>et seq.</T3> Section 315 of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 1461, establishes theNational Estuarine Reserve Research System.  (b) ``Assistant Administrator'' (AA) means the Assistant Administratorfor Ocean Services and Coastal Zone Management, National Ocean Service,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce,or designee.  (c) ``Coastal state'' means a state of the United States in or borderingon, the Atlantic, Pacific, or Arctic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, Long IslandSound, or one or more of the Great Lakes. For the purposes of this title,the term also includes Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealthof the Northern Marianas, the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands,and American Samoa (see 16 U.S.C. 1453(4)).  (d) ``Estuary'' means that part of a river or stream or body of water havingunimpaired connection with the open sea, where the sea water is measurablydiluted with fresh water derived from land drainage. The term also includesestuary-type areas of the Great Lakes (see 16 U.S.C. 1453(7)).  (e) ``National Estuarine Research Reserve'' means an area that is a representativeestuarine ecosystem suitable for long/term research, which may includeall or the key land and water portion of an estuary, and adjacent transitionalareas and uplands constituting to the extent feasible a natural unit, andwhich is set aside as a natural field laboratory to provide long-term opportunitiesfor research, education, and interpretation on the ecological relationshipswithin the area (see 16 U.S.C. 1453(8)). This includes those areas designatedas national estuarine sanctuaries under section 315 of the Act prior tothe date of the enactment of the Coastal Zone Management ReauthorizationAct of 1985 and each area designated as a national estuarine research reservepursuant to the provisions of these regulations.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;921.3  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">National Estuarine Reserve Research System Biogeographic ClassificationScheme and Estuarine Typologies.  </ITAG>(a) National estuarine research reserves are chosen to reflect regionaldifferences and to include a variety of ecosystem types. A biogeographicclassification scheme based on regional variations in the nation's coastalzone has been developed. The biogeographic classification scheme is usedto ensure that the national Estuarine Reserve Research System includesat least one site from each region. The estuarine typology system is utilizedto ensure that sites in the System reflect the wide range of estuarinetypes within the United States.(b) The biogeographic classification scheme, presented in Appendix 1, contains27 regions.

(b) For purposes of consistency review by states with a federally approvedcoastal zone management program, the designation of a national estuarineresearch reserve is deemed to be a Federal activity, which, if directlyaffecting the state's coastal zone, must be undertaken in a manner consistentto the maximum extent practicable with the approved state coastal zoneprogram as provided by section 307(c)(1) of the Act, and implementing regulationsat 15 CFR Part 930, Subpart C. At the earliest practicable time, a statewith a federally approved coastal zone management program shall consultwith appropriate state officials concerning the consistency of the proposednational estuarine research reserve. <ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart B_Site Selection, Post Site Selection and Management PlanDevelopment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 921.10 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General. </ITAG>(a) A state may apply for Federal financial assistance for the purposeof site selection, preparation of documents specified in andSection; 921.13(draft management plan and environmental impact statement (EIS)) and theconduct of research necessary to complete basic characterization studies.The total Federal share of this group of predesignation awards may notexceed $100,000, of which up to $25,000 may be used for site selectionas described in andSection; 921.11. In the case of a multi-component nationalestuarine research reserve in which one or more components are proposedto be located within different states, this provision applies to each state.Financial assistance application procedures are specified in Subpart H.(b) In selecting a site, a state may choose to develop a multiple-siteresearch reserve reflecting a diversity of habitats in a single biogeographicregion. A multiple-site research reserve also allows the state to developcomplementary research and educational programs within the multiple componentsof its research reserve. Multiple-site research reserves are treated asone reserve in terms of financial assistance and development of an overallmanagement framework and plan. Each individual component of a proposedmultiple-site research reserve shall be evaluated both separately underandSection; 921.11(c) and collectively within the context of the multi-componentreserve as part of the site selection process. A state may propose to establisha multiple-site research reserve at the time of the intitial site selection,or at any point in the development or operation of the estuarine researchreserve, even after Federal funding for the single component research reservehas expired. If the state decides to develop a multiple-site national estuarineresearch reserve after the initial acquisition and development award ismade for a single site, the proposal is subject to the requirements setforth in andSection; 921.33. Importantly, however, a state may not proposeto add one or more components to an already designated research reserveif the operation and management of such research reserve has been founddeficient or the research conducted is not consistent with the EstuarineResearch Guidelines in accordance with the provisions of Subpart E. Inaddition, the total acquisition funding for a multiple-site research reserveremains limited to $4,000,000 (see andSection; 921.20).

(c) As part of the site selection process, the state and NOAA shall evaluateand select the final site(s). NOAA has final authority in approving suchsites. Site selection shall be guided by the following principles: (1) The site's contribution to the biogeographical and typological balanceof the National Estuarine Reserve Research System (see the biogeographicclassification scheme and typology set forth in andSection; 921.3 and Appendices1 and 2);(2) The site's ecological characteristics, including its biological productivity,diversity of flora and fauna, and capacity to attract a broad range ofresearch and educational interests. The proposed site must be a representativeestuarine ecosystem and should, to the maximum extent possible, be a naturalsystem; (3) Assurance that the site's boundaries encompass an adequate portionof the key land and water areas of the natural system to approximate anecological unit and to ensure effective conservation. Boundary size willvary greatly depending on the nature of the ecosystem. Research reserveboundaries must encompass the area within which adequate control has orwill be established by the managing entity over human activities occurringwithin the reserve. General, reserve boundaries will encompass two areas:key land and water areas (or ``core area'') and a buffer zone. Key landand water areas and a buffer zone will likely require significantly differentlevels of control (see andSection; 921.13(a)(7)). The term ``key land andwater areas'' refers to that core area within the reserve that is so vitalto the functioning of the estuarine ecosystem that it must be under a levelof control sufficient to ensure the long-term viability of the reservefor research on natural resources. Key land and water areas, which comprisethe core area, are those ecological units of a natural estuarine systemwhich preserve, for research purposes, a full range of significant physical,chemical and biological factors contributing to the diversity of fauna,flora and natural processes occurring within the estuary. The determinationof which land and water areas are ``key'' to a particular reserve mustbe based on specific scientific knowledge of the area. A basic principleto follow when deciding upon key land and water areas is that they shouldencompass resources representative of the total ecosystem, and which ifcompromised could endanger the research objectives of the reserve. Theterm ``buffer zone'' refers to an area adjacent to or surrounding key landand water areas and essential to their integrity. Buffer zones protectthe core area and provide additional protection for estuarine-dependentspecies, including those that are rare or endangered. When determined appropriateby the state and approved by NOAA, the buffer zone may also include anarea necessary for facilities required for research and interpretation.Additionally, buffer zones should be established sufficient to accommodatea shift of the core area as a result of biological, ecological or geomorphologicalchange which reasonably could be expected to occur. National estuarineresearch reserves may include existing Federal or state lands already ina protected status where mutual benefit can be enhanced. Importantly, however,NOAA will not approve a site for potential national estuarine researchreserve status that is dependent upon the inclusion of currently protectedFederal lands in order to meet the requirements for research reserve status(such as key land and water areas). Such lands may only be included withina research reserve to serve as a buffer or for other ancillary purposes;(4) The site's suitability for long-term estuarine research, incuding ecologicalfactors and proximity to existing research facilities and educational institutions;(5) The site's compatibility with existing and potential land and wateruses in contiguous areas; and (6) The site's importance to education and interpretive efforts, consistentwith the need for continued protection of the natural system. (d) Early in the site selection process the state must seek the views ofaffected landowers, local governments, other state and Federal agenciesand other parties who are interested in the area(s) being considered forselection as a potential national estuarine research reserve. After thelocal government(s) and affected landowner(s) have been contacted, at leastone public meeting shall be held in the area of the proposed site. Noticeof such a meeting, including the time, place, and relevant subject matter,shall be announced by the state through the area's principal news mediaat least 15 days prior to the date of the meeting and by NOAA in the<T4> Federal Register</T4>. (e) A state request for NOAA approval of a proposed site (or sites in thecase of a multi-site reserve) must contain a description of the proposedsite in relationship to each of the site selection principles (andSection;921.11(c)) and the following information: (1) An analysis of the proposed site based on the biogeographical scheme/typologydiscussed in andSection; 921.3 and set forth in Appendices 1 and 2; (2) A description of the proposed site and its major resources, includinglocation, proposed boundaries, and adjacent land uses. Maps, includingaerial photographs, are required; (3) A description of the public participation process used by the stateto solicit the views of interested parties, a summary of comments, and,if interstate issues are involved, documentation that the Governor(s) ofthe other affected state(s) has been contacted. Copies of all correspondence,including contact letters to all affected landowners must be appended;(4) A list of all sites considered and a brief summary of the basis fornot selecting the non-preferred sites; and (5) A nomination of the proposed site(s) for designation as a NationalEstuarine Research Reserve by the Governor of the coastal state in whichthe area is located. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 921.12</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Post site selection.</ITAG>(a) At the time of the state's request for NOAA approval of a proposedsite, the state may submit a request for up to $40,000 of predesignationfunds to develop the draft management plan and for the collection of theinformation necessary for preparation of the environmental impact statement.At this time, the state may also submit a request for the remainder ofthe predesignation fund for research necessary to complete a basic characterizationof the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the site approvedby NOAA. The state's request for these post site selection funds must beaccompanied by the information specified in Subpart H and, for draft managementplan development and environmental impact statement information collection,the following programmatic information:(1) A draft management plan outline (see andSection; 921.13(a) below); and(2) An outline of a draft memorandum of understanding (MOU) between thestate and NOAA detailing the Federal-state role in research reserve managementduring the initial period of Federal funding and expressing the state'slong-term commitment to operate and manage the national estuarine researchreserve.(b) The state is eligible to use the funds referenced in andSection; 921.12(a)after the proposed site is approved by NOAA.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 921.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Management plan and environmental impact statement development.</ITAG>(a) After NOAA approves the state's proposed site and request to use remainingpredesignation funds for draft management plan development and environmentalimpact statement development, the state shall develop a draft managementplan, including an MOU.

In selectinga preferred method(s) for establishing adequate state control over areaswithin the proposed boundaries of the reserve, the state shall performthe following steps for each parcel determined to be part of the key landand water areas (control over which is necessary to protect the integrityof the reserve for research purposes), and for those parcels required forresearch and interpretive support facilities or buffer purposes:(i) Determine, with appropriate justification, the minimum level of control(s)required (<T3>e.g., </T3>management agreement, regulation, less-than-fee propertyinterest, fee simple property acquisition, a combination of these approachesor other feasible alternative);(ii) Identify the level of existing state control(s);(iii) Identify the level of additional state control(s), if any, necessaryto meet the minimum requirements identified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of thissection;(iv) Examine all reasonable alternatives for attaining the level of controlidentified in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section, and perform a costanalysis of each; and (v) Rank, <T3>in order of cost, </T3>the methods (including acquisition) identifiedin paragraph (a)(7)(iv) of this section.An assessment of the relative cost-effectiveness of control alternativesshall include a reasonable estimate of both short-term costs (<T3>e.g., </T3>acquisition of property interests, regulatory program developmentincluding associated enforcement costs, negotiation, adjudication, etc.)and long-term costs (<T3>e.g., </T3>monitoring, enforcement, adjudication, management and coordination,etc.). In selecting a preferred method(s) for establishing adequate statecontrol over each parcel examined under the process described above, thestate shall give priority consideration to the least costly method(s) ofattaining the minimum level of long-term control required. Generally, withthe possible exception of buffer areas required for support facilities,the level of control(s) required for buffer areas will be considerablyless than that required for key land and water areas.

The term ``costs'' applies to both the Federal andnon-Federal shares.(b) Costs claimed as charges to the award must be reasonable, beneficialand necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the financialassistance award and must be incurred during the award period, except asprovided under preagreement costs, paragraph (d) of this section.(c) Costs must not be allocable to or included as a cost of any other Federally-financedprogram in either the current or a prior award period.(d) Costs incurred prior to the effective date of the award (preagreementcosts) are allowable only when specifically approved in the financial assistanceagreement. For non-construction awards, costs incurred more than threemonths before the award beginning date will not be approved. For constructionand land acquisition awards, NOAA will evaluate preagreement costs on acase-by-case basis.(e) General guidelines for the non-Federal share are contained in OMB CircularA-102, Attachment F. The following may be used by the state in satisfyingthe matching requirement:<T3>(1) Site Selection and Post Site Selection Awards.</T3> Cash and in-kindcontributions (value of goods and services directly benefiting and specificallyidentifiable to this part of the project) are allowable. Land may not beused as match.<T3>(2) Acquisition and Development Awards.</T3> Cash and in-kind contributionsare allowable. In general, the fair market value of lands to be includedwithin the research reserve boundaries and acquired pursuant to the Act,with other than Federal funds, may be used as match. However, the fairmarket value of real property allowable as match is limited to the fairmarket value of a real property interest equivalent to, or required toattain, the level of control over such land(s) identified by the stateand approved by the Federal Government as that necessary for the protectionand management of the national estuarine research reserve. Appraisals mustbe performed according to Federal appraisal standards as detailed in NOAAregulations and the ``Uniform Appraisal Standard for Federal Land Acquisitions.''The fair market value of privately donated land, at the time of donation,as established by an independent appraiser and certified by a responsibleofficial of the state (pursuant to OMB Circular A-102 Revised, AttachmentF, as amended or superseded) may also be used as match. Land, includingsubmerged lands already in the state's possession, in a fully-protectedstatus consistent with the purposes of the National Estuarine Reserve ResearchSystem, may be used as match only if it was acquired starting within aone-year period prior to the award of preacquisition or acquisition fundsand with the intent to establish a national estuarine research reserve.For state lands not in a fully-protected status (<T3>e.g.,</T3> a state park containing an easement for subsurface mineralrights), the value of the development right or foregone value may be usedas match if acquired by or donated to the state for inclusion within theresearch reserve. A state may initially use as match land valued at greaterthan the Federal share of the acquisition and development award. The valuein excess of the amount required as match for the initial award may beused to match subsequent supplemental acquisition and development awardsfor the national estuarine research reserve (see also andSection; 921.20).Costs related to land acquisition, such as appraisals, legal fees and surveys,may also be used as match.<T3>(3) Operation and Management Awards.</T3> Generally, cash and in-kindcontributions (directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to thisphase of the project), except land, are allowable. However, for the fourthand any subsequent operation and management awards (see andSection; 921.32),if a statutory basis for long-term operation and management of the nationalestuarine research reserve (specific to or including specific referenceto that research reserve) has not been enacted by the state and state fundsadequate for the support of a research reserve manager or the equivalenthave not been appropriated or otherwise demonstrated to be available, thenallowable costs for match are limited to non-Federal supported personnelservice (<T3>e.g.,</T3> state employees) necessary for direct support of researchreserve operation and management as outlined in the federally approvedfinal management plan.
