More than $3.2 billion would be added to President Bush'sbudget for health and education, but savings in otherdomestic accounts will make it more difficult to sustainfunding for high-profile science endeavors by the EnergyDepartment and the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration.</LP><TEXT>   A $21.5 billion energy and water bill, approved minutesafter the committee spending blueprint was cleared,incorporates a nearly 19% cut in the president's budget forthe superconducting supercollider, with the debatedemonstrating new strains in the once overwhelming supportfor the giant atom smasher.   By a 32-11 vote, the panel rejected an amendment to makefurther cuts of $43.5 million to pay for a competinghigh-energy physics project at the Energy Department'sFermilab in Illinois. The fight divided powerful subcommitteechairmen and drew in such senior Midwestern lawmakers asHouse Republican Leader Robert Michel and Ways and MeansCommittee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski.   The action came as Congress gave final approval to alarger $1.4 trillion budget resolution forecasting a deficitof $278.8 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.Adopted 239-181 in the House and 57-41 in the Senate, themeasure provides a framework for consideration of thespending bills, but its practical impact is being largelypre-empted by October's deficit-reduction accord and theinherent power of the Appropriations committees.   Entrenched interests in the House panel used theirinfluence to protect rural development programs, for example,and the allocations for health and education are severalbillion dollars less than the more ambitious budgetresolution promises. The committee totals ensure that naturalresources and law enforcement funding will be a majorbattleground this year, with $1.2 billion cut from thepresident's budget for those accounts financing the spaceprogram.   In other budget and legislative action yesterday:   -- Congress approved $556 million in supplemental fundingfor State Department and Pentagon accounts to meet theinitial costs of U.S. relief efforts for Kurdish refugees inIraq. The measure, which passed on a 387-33 roll call in theHouse and on a voice vote in the Senate, includes $320.5million to finance the military airlift through the end ofthis month, but significant new money will be needed tocontinue the effort through this summer.   -- A nearly $8.5 billion fiscal 1992 military constructionbill won approval from the House Appropriations Committee.The measure provides for a 1.3% increase from the currentyear ending Sept. 30, but funding for North Atlantic TreatyOrganization infrastructure accounts would be cut 17%. TheNATO savings are largely expended elsewhere to finance a$30.2 million Army and Marine air facility in the hometown ofRep. John Murtha (D., Pa.), chairman of the House defenseappropriations subcommittee.   -- A little-noticed provision in yesterday's House energyand water bill would block implementation of a new law toestablish chief financial officers in federal agencies. Thelanguage is opposed by White House Budget Director RichardDarman but has the backing of Appropriations CommitteeChairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.), who argues that the newofficers would turn congressional decisions over to theexecutive branch.   ---   Jeffrey H.
