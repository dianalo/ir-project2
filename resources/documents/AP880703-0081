The report relesed Saturday by the Congressional ResearchService rejected claims by the Reagan administration that thecountry's status as a large debtor country was not cause forconcern.   The study predicted that while the country's trade deficit willfinally show an improvement this year, after deteriorating for sixyears, this improvement could be short-lived.   The report forecast that the deficit in the broadest measure oftrade, the current account, would fall to $151 billion this year,down slightly from a record $154 billion deficit in 1987.   The report predicted a further decrease to $129 billion in 1989,saying these improvements were virtually assured given the declinesin the value of the dollar that have already taken place.   But the study said the trade deficit would begin rising againsharply in the 1990s and could hit $326 billion by 1995.   The study said it based this outlook on assumptions that thedollar does not decline further in value and that current growthrates and interest rates in the United States relative to othercountries remain essentially unchanged.   The dollar has actually been rising in recent weeks, promptingconcern among economists who believe the U.S. currency still needsto drop for the U.S. trade deficit to narrow further. A cheaperdollar makes U.S. exports more attractive on overseas markets andimports more expensive to Americans.   If the dollar does not decline, the report projected that theheavy import penetration the United States has suffered through the1980s will continue.   The string of higher trade imbalances would mean that thecountry's position as a net debtor would worsen as well.   The government announced on Thursday that total U.S. foreigndebt increased to $368.2 billion at the end of 1987, furtherlengthening the country's lead as the world's largest debtornation. This means that foreigners now own more in U.S. investmentsthan Americans own in overseas investments.   The congressional study projected that U.S. foreign debt wouldclimb to $576 billion at the end of this year and surpass $1trillion in 1991. By the end of 1995, the total foreign debt wouldbe $2.06 trillion, or one-fourth of the country's total grossnational product, the report said.   A debt of that size would require an annual payment of $96billion to foreigners to service the debt, an amount equal to 1.2percent of the projected GNP for that year, the study said.   That would mean if the GNP increased by 3 percent in 1995, agenerally optimistic outlook, one-third of the increase would besiphoned off to meet debt obligations to foreigners.   ``If, on the other hand, we are pessimistic about real growthprospects, seeing only a 1 percent annual increase as likely, thendebt service would tend to preclude any improvement in U.S. livingstandards in the next decade,'' the report said.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who requested the congressionalstudy, said it showed that without a dramatic change in thecountry's trade policies, the size of America's foreign debt willexplode over the next six years.   Bentsen was a key sponsor of an omnibus trade measure recentlyvetoed by President Reagan. He is leading the effort to get astripped-down version less objectionable to Reagan passed into law.   ``Even though the trade deficit will go down a little this yearand again a little bit next year, unless trade policiesdramatically change, then they're going to start up,'' Bentsen said.   The congressional study, while presenting a pessimistic view ofwhat could happen, is not out of line with projections made byprivate economists. Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. said that dependingon what happens to the dollar, world growth rates and the U.S.federal budget deficit, America's foreign debt burden could beanywhere from $900 billion to $2.5 trillion by 1995.   The U.S. debt of $368.2 billion for 1987 was 36.8 percent higherthan the previous year and served to illustrate how fast theforeign debt is accumulating. The United States had an investmentcushion of $89.4 billion as recently as 1983, making it the world'slargest creditor nation, a position now held by Japan.   Democratic critics hope to make the country's slide from thelargest creditor nation to the largest debtor nation an issue inthis year's presidential campaign. They contend that the burgeoningforeign debt is eroding America's political and economic standingin the world.   But the administration, sensitive to the issue in an electionyear, held a lengthy briefing last Thursday, when the new debttotal was released, to argue that the United States should not beconsidered in a class with such large Third World debtors asBrazil, Mexico and Argentina.   ``We are nowhere near getting into trouble,'' CommerceUndersecretary Robert Ortner told reporters. He said thatforeigners still own no more than 5 percent of the assets in aneconomy that turns out $4.5 trillion in goods and services a year.   But private economists contend that the growing foreign debtmakes the United States more vulnerable to pressure from foreigninvestors, driving up U.S. interest rates and heightening thevolatility of the dollar.</TEXT></DOC>
