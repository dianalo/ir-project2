The four-day conference on ``The Anatomy of Hate''has attractedabout 70 participants from 30 countries _ including worldstatesmen, Nobel laureates, thinkers and activists.   Among those scheduled to attend are South African anti-apartheidactivist Nelson Mandela; Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, aformer dissident playwright; French President Francois Mitterrand,and Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis.   Wiesel, the Nazi death camp survivor who won the 1986 NobelPeace Prize for his work exposing the horrors of the Holocaust,organized the conference with the Oslo-based Nobel Peace Prizecommittee to discuss the problem of hate.   Last fall, when he issued the call to attend the conference,Wiesel said he feared that the new freedoms won by East blocnations would cause smoldering religious, ethnic and regionalhatred to flare.   Now, he said, he wishes that the conference could have been heldsix months ago, when it might have helped relax tensions in suchhotspots of conflict as the Persian Gulf and South Africa.   ``Hate, as we know, wears many masks,'' said Wiesel, 61, who isnow a U.S. citizen and Boston University professor.   He asked participants to expose various forms of hatred:``racial hate, religious hate, ethnic hate, fanaticism, bigotry,prejudice and discrimination.''   Wiesel said he hoped the seminar would end with some kind ofjoint declaration.   Yelena Bonner, the Soviet human rights activist and widow of the1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov, said theparticipants must first admit ``that hate is an emotion given us byGod.''   ``Our conference is opening at time that is not the best forcalm and clear reason. ... After the August 2 invasion (of Kuwait),we are living in a very different reality,'' she said, speakingthrough an interpreter.   Ms. Bonner said years of arms sales by the Soviet Union andFrance to ``a known assassin'' like Iraqi leader Saddam Husseinprove that firm international rules, and not just debates aboutmorals, are needed to protect human rights.   On Monday, Mandela is scheduled to open a discussion onapartheid, South Africa's system of racial separation.   Others attending the conference are Harvard economist JohnKenneth Galbraith, actor Gregory Peck, former President JimmyCarter and Chai Ling, a leader of last year's pro-democracymovement in Beijing.</TEXT></DOC>
