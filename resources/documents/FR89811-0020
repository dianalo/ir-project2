There was concern during considerationof the IRCA that employers in seasonal agricultural services, who had cometo rely on unauthorized aliens to perform field work, would be unable toobtain sufficient legal workers to satisfy their needs. To address this concern, the IRCA added section 210 to the INA to establisha program that grants temporary resident alien status to special agriculturalworkers (SAWs) who can demonstrate that they performed seasonal agriculturalservices for at least 90 man-days during the 12-month period ending May1, 1986. The legislation specifies that individuals admitted under thisprovision are not required to continue working in agriculture, and in factare free to seek employment in any occupation or industry. Because there was also concern that large numbers of SAWs would in factleave agricultural employment, which would again cause a shortage of workersto perform seasonal agricultural services, the IRCA added section 210Ato the INA, which provides a system for admitting additional special agriculturalworkers, known as replenishment agricultural workers (RAWs). The numberof RAWs who may be admitted in any fiscal year (FY), beginning with FY1990 and ending with FY 1993, is the smaller of (1) the annual numericallimitation established by formula in section 210A(b) of the INA, or (2)the shortage number determined by the Secretaries. These proposed regulationsset forth the procedures to be used by the Secretaries in determining theshortage number and the annual numerical limitation.  The INA requires that before the beginning of each FY, starting with FY1990 and ending with FY 1993, the Secretaries shall determine jointly thenumber (if any) of additional aliens who should be admitted to the UnitedStates or who should otherwise acquire the status of aliens lawfully admittedfor temporary residence, to meet a shortage of workers to perform seasonalagricultural services. The number so determined is referred to as the ``shortagenumber.'' The INA further provides that the Attorney General shall providefor the admission for lawful temporary resident status, or for the adjustmentof status to lawful temporary resident status, of a number of aliens equalto the shortage number (if any). Such number may not exceed the annualnumerical limitation established by section 210A(b) of the INA.The annual numerical limitation is a limit, set by a statutory formula,on the number of aliens who may be admitted or who otherwise may acquirelawful temporary resident alien status under the provisions of INA whichpermit the entry of additional aliens for employment in seasonal agriculturalservices. The annual numerical limitation is based upon a percentage ofthose individuals who had their status adjusted under the special agriculturalworker (SAW) program established by section 210 of the INA, less the numberof SAWs, including RAWs, who continue to work in seasonal agriculturalservices, and must be adjusted to take into account any change in the numberof nonimmigrant aliens admitted under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of theINA (H-2A workers) to perform temporary seasonal agricultural services.Because of the unexpectedly large number of SAW applicants, the Immigrationand Naturalization Service (INS) has indicated that it may not be ableto make final determinations on all applicants prior to the beginning ofFY 1990. In the event a final determination has not been made on all applications,in order to establish the numerical limitation, the Secretaries will calculatethe annual numerical limitation based upon the number of aliens finallyadjudicated (approved) as SAWs as reported by INS to the Director of theBureau of the Census (hereafter ``the Director); the Director will advisethe Secretaries by September 1, 1989, of the number to be used in the calculation,based upon the latest available INS data. The Secretaries will announcethe annual numerical limitation in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at the time the shortage number is announced.Consideration was given to using an estimate of the number of SAWs whowill be adjusted under section 210 of the INA, applying the ratio of approvalsto denials, of those applications which have been finally determined, tothe number of applications remaining to be adjudicated. That approach wasabandoned because there was no statutory language, nor legislative history,to support such an approach.In the event INS is not able to complete its adjudication of all SAW applicationsby the end of FY 1989, the Secretaries, prior to the end of each of thefollowing fiscal quarters, will recalculate the annual numerical limitationby including in the ``starting number'' all those aliens who have beenfinally adjudicated as SAWs subsequent to any earlier determinations ofthe annual numerical limitation, and by adjusting the number of SAWs whoworked in seasonal agricultural services to take into account the increasein the number of reportable workers who obtained SAW status.If the annual numerical limitation is low enough to serve as an effectiveupper limit on the number of RAWs to be admitted (in other words, if theannual numerical limitation is lower than the shortage number), any increasesin the annual numerical limitation that results from the recalculationswill permit entry or adjustment of additional RAWs until the shortage numberis reached, or the annual numerical limitation is again an effective limit.In addition, if an emergency increase in the shortage number is grantedpursuant to andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.20 of these proposed regulations, but additional RAWs arebarred from entry due to the annual numerical limitation, the Secretarieswill recalculate the annual numerical limitation based upon the most recentdata available from INS and the Director.These proposed regulations set forth the procedures to be used by the Secretariesin determining the shortage number. Any aliens to be admitted as a resultof a determination that a shortage of workers to perform seasonal agriculturalservices exists are known as RAWs and will be admitted under criteria establishedby the INS in regulations located at 8 CFR part 210a.The shortage number is determined under a statutory formula and consistsof (1) the need for labor to perform seasonal agricultural services, statedin work-days, minus (2) the supply of such labor, stated in work-days,divided by (3) the work-day per worker factor as determined by the Bureauof the Census. These proposed regulations also set forth the responsibilitiesof the Federal agencies involved in the process. USDA under proposed andSection;<T2>XXX</T2>.11 will provide certain data needed in order for the Secretariesto determine the level of need for workers to perform seasonal agriculturalservices. DOL will provide data on the supply of such workers as indicatedin proposed andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.12. The Director is also involved under proposed andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.13 and will determine the average number of work-days of seasonalagricultural services performed by SAWs in the United States at any timein a given FY. (Note: although the language of the INA indicates that thisestimate would be based upon the number of SAWs who worked in seasonalagricultural services ``at any time'' during a FY, the Conference Reporton the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (H.R. Conf. Rep. No.99-1000, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 96, reprinted in 1986 U.S. Code Cong. andamp;Admin. News 5840, 5852), however, specifies that the term ``at any time''means at least 15 man-days. Thus, the Secretaries have defined ``at anytime'' to mean at least 15 days.) The average number of work-days determinedby the Director is known as the work-day per worker factor and becomesthe denominator in the statutory formula which the Secretaries must useto determine the shortage number. The term ``work-day'' is defined in thisproposed regulation as a calendar day in which at least 4 hours of workin seasonal agricultural services is performed, and is used in lieu ofthe statutory term ``man-day,'' which is used in other labor standardsstatutes (defined as one hour per day) and is used under INA to determinewhether an alien has sufficient experience in agricultural employment tobe eligible for SAW/RAW status. In making the determination of the work-day per worker factor, the Directorwill use information contained in the reports (ESA-92, OMB approval number1215-0168) which must be submitted by employers of SAWs under regulationslocated at 29 CFR Part 502. In doing so, the language of INA requires thatthe Director count the work experience of SAWs during 1989 in order toestimate the work-day per worker factor applicable during 1990, but limitsthe Director to counting only the experience of RAWs when determining thework-day per worker factor for FY's 1991-1993. The proposed regulationsupplements the statute by establishing a method for setting the work-dayper worker factor in the event that no RAWs are admitted in a particularyear. The Secretaries propose that if no RAWs are admitted during FY 1990,the work-day per worker factor determined for FY 1990 will be the factorfor 1991. For FY 1992 and 1993, if no RAWs are admitted during the twoprevious FYs, the work-day per worker factor determined for FY 1990 willbe the factor. However, commenters are encouraged to suggest reasonablealternatives to this method for consideration in the further developmentof these regulations. In recognition of the uncertainties associated with agricultural production,the statute contains emergency procedures for adjusting the shortage number.These proposed regulations establish the procedure through which a groupor association representing employers in seasonal agricultural servicesmay appeal to the Secretaries for an increase in the shortage number. Whilethe request may be made by a group or association which is experiencinga shortage of workers in a particular area or region, the process is notdesigned or intended to deal with localized, short-term problems that individualfarmers may have in obtaining needed workers. To succeed in obtaining anincrease in the shortage number, the requesters must demonstrate that asignificant increase in the shortage number, which is determined on a nationalbasis, is appropriate. That is, they must show that they have undertakenreasonable recruitment efforts and that they continue to have a significantshortage of the labor needed to avoid crop damage or loss. Further, thatthe need for labor to avoid crop damage or loss is significantly greaterthan the availability of able, willing, qualified, and unemployed SAWs,rural low skill, or manual laborers, and domestic agricultural workers.Requesters must show that they have undertaken reasonable recruitment effortsby recruiting in the region or regions of traditional and expected laborsupply, offering wages, working conditions, and other terms of employment,including, but not limited to, housing, transportation, meals, and subsistence,comparable to or better than those provided generally in the same or comparableoccupations and crops in the labor market area, and that the normal qualificationsfor such occupations and crops were applied. The statute requires that the Secretaries make their decision on the emergencyrequest within 21 days of receipt of the request. Because of this shorttime within which to make the decision, interested parties will have only10 days in which to provide information in support, or opposition, of therequest. The Secretaries will use any information available from the StateEmployment Service Agencies, and the United States Employment Service toevaluate the request. USDA and DOL staff will meet to evaluate the originalrequest and any comments that may have been submitted by interested parties.Staff members may contact local offices of State Employment Service Agenciesin the alleged shortage areas and in labor supply States to confirm thatreasonable recruitment efforts were conducted and to learn the extent towhich able, willing, and qualified workers were found to be available.Staff may also contact local county extension agents associated with USDA'sExtension Service in the alleged shortage areas for information they mayhave regarding the labor supply and crop conditions. This emergency procedureis an area of particular concern to the Secretaries and one in which commentersare encouraged to provide comments. These proposed regulations also set forth the procedure through which agroup of agricultural workers may petition the Secretaries for a decreasein the number of work-days of work required in order to maintain theirtemporary resident alien status. Under section 210A(d)(5) of the INA, RAWsmust work at least 90 work-days in seasonal agricultural services, in eachof three years, in order to maintain their status. If an oversupply ofworkers should exist, due to limited employment opportunities in seasonalagricultural services (such as might be caused by extreme weather conditions),the statute provides for the possible reduction in the work-day requirementfor the particular FY involved. (<T4>Note:</T4> the INA, in setting forth the procedure for a RAW to requesta change in the work-day requirement, refers to subparagraphs (A) and (B)of section 210A(d)(2), but that is a typographical error, since subsection(d)(2) has no subparagraphs (A) nor (B). Such subparagraphs are found onlyin subsection (d)(5).) RAWs are required by subparagraph (A) of section210A(d)(5) to perform seasonal agricultural services for at least 90 work-daysin each of the first three years after the alien obtained the status ofan alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence, in order to avoid deportation.Furthermore, subparagraph (B) of section 210A(d)(5) provides that suchan alien may not be naturalized, unless that alien has worked at least90 work-days in seasonal agricultural services in each of five years afterobtaining the status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence.These proposed regulations were developed in consultation with the Departmentof Justice and the Bureau of the Census. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291; Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>The USDA and the DOL have determined that this proposed rule is not a majorrule under Executive Order 12291. They have also determined that this rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. This proposed rule is largely procedural in nature andsets forth the manner in which the USDA and the DOL will use availableinformation, including INS information and Bureau of the Census estimatesto make certain determinations regarding whether there is a shortage ofworkers in the United States to perform seasonal agricultural services,and related determinations. Consequently, the USDA and DOL certify underthe Regulatory Flexibility Act that the rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1e and 29 CFR Part 503 </ITAG>Agriculture, Aliens, Immigration, Labor, Migrant worker, Rural labor.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="72">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">7 CFR Part 1e </ITAG>Accordingly, it is proposed that Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulationsbe amended by adding Part 1e as set forth at the end of this document.<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1e_METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE SHORTAGE NUMBER UNDER SECTION210A OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General Provisions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.0 Introduction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.1 Purpose and scope. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.2 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.3 Overall determination of the shortage number. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.4 No replenishment if no shortage. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.5 Determination of need. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.6 Determination of supply. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.7 Estimate of the number of SAWs in seasonal agricultural servicesand determination of work-day per worker factor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.8 Announcement of the annual numerical limitation on the admissionof replenishment agricultural workers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Procedure for Determination of the Shortage Number. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.10 General. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.11 Data for determination of need to be collected by the Secretaryof Agriculture. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.12 Data for determination of supply to be collected by the Secretaryof Labor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.13 Director, Bureau of the Census, to determine the workday perworker factor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.14 Secretaries of Agriculture and Labor, joint determination ofthe shortage number. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Emergency Procedure for Increase in Shortage Number. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.20 Request by group or association representing employers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Procedure for Decreasing the Work-day Requirement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1e.30 Request by group of special agricultural workers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>8 U.S.C. 1161.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 8th day of August, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Clayton K.

Under this program,aliens could apply (during the 18-month period ending November 30, 1988)to have their status adjusted to that of an alien lawfully admitted fortemporary residence, provided they could demonstrate residence in the UnitedStates and performance of seasonal agricultural services for at least 90man-days during the 12 month period ending May 1, 1986. While employmentin seasonal agricultural services was required in order to qualify forSAW status, there is no requirement that SAWs continue to work in agriculture.Because SAWs may seek employment in any occupation or industry, the INAprovides a framework for admitting additional aliens to work in seasonalagricultural services if a shortage of workers develops. (b) Pursuant to section 210A(a)(1) of the INA, before the beginning ofeach fiscal year (FY), beginning with FY 1990 and ending with FY 1993,the Secretaries shall determine jointly the number (if any) of additionalaliens who should be admitted to the United States or who should otherwiseacquire the status of aliens lawfully admitted for temporary residenceunder section 210A of the INA during the FY to meet a shortage of workersto perform seasonal agricultural services. Such number is known as the``shortage number'', which may not exceed the annual numerical limitationon the admission of additional SAWs, known in this part as RAWs. (c) This part sets forth the procedure that will be used by the Secretariesin making a determination of the shortage number, and of the annual numericallimitation. This part also establishes the procedure which a group or associationof employers of individuals who work in seasonal agricultural servicesmust use in order to request the Secretaries to increase the shortage number.Further, this part sets forth the procedure through which a group of RAWsmay request the Secretaries to decrease the number of work-days of employmentrequired for a given FY in order to maintain their temporary resident alienstatus. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;</ITAG><T2>XXX</T2>.1 Purpose and scope. (a) This part has a narrow focus. It is based in part on regulations alreadypromulgated by DOL, USDA, and INS, all of which have responsibilities underthe INA. Where appropriate in this part, reference will be made to existingregulations and their location. (b) Section 210A(a)(1) of the INA requires action by the Secretaries todetermine the shortage number. That number will become the basis upon whichthe Attorney General will provide for the admission for lawful temporaryresident status, or for the adjustment of status to lawful temporary residentstatus, of a number of aliens. The number (if any) of such aliens to beadmitted will be the lesser of the shortage number, or the annual numericallimitation on admission of additional SAWs, which is set by formula insection 210A(b) of the INA. These additional SAWs are known as RAWs andmay be admitted beginning with FY 1990. (c) This part establishes the procedure by which the Secretaries will useavailable information to make the determination required by the INA. Thispart is not concerned with the procedure, nor qualifications, through whichindividuals may become eligible for RAW status. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;</ITAG><T2>XXX</T2>.2 Definitions. For purposes of this part: (a) ``Act'' and ``INA'' mean the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.1101, <T3>et seq</T3>.), as amended by the Immigration Reform and Control Actof 1986 (IRCA), with reference particularly to sections 210 and 210A (8U.S.C. 1160 and 1161). (b) ``Alien `A' Number'' refers to an INS Alien Registration Number assignedto each alien. (c) ``Annual numerical limitation'' refers to the upper limit on the numberof aliens who may be admitted as RAWs in any FY and is set by statutoryformula in section 210A(b) of INA. If the shortage number determined underthis part exceeds the annual numerical limitation, the number of alienswho may be admitted, or have their status adjusted, cannot exceed the annualnumerical limitation. (d) ``Director'' means the Director of the Bureau of the Census, UnitedStates Department of Commerce. (e) ``DOL'' means the United States Department of Labor. (f) ``Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)'' is the agency withinthe United States Department of Justice which is responsible for administeringthe INA. (g) ``Replenishment Agricultural Worker (RAW)'' is an alien identifiedwith an INS Alien Registration Number in the A94000000 series (A94 followedby any six digits) who is admitted during FY 1990 through FY 1993 for lawfultemporary resident alien status or whose status is adjusted to that ofan alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence, in accordance withsection 210A of the INA, to meet a shortage of workers employed in seasonalagricultural services.(h) ``Reportable Worker'' is an alien employed in seasonal agriculturalservices who is admitted with lawful temporary resident alien status orwhose status is adjusted to that of an alien lawfully admitted for temporaryresidence, and who is identified by an INS Alien Registration Number inthe A90000000 series (A9 followed by any seven digits). This series includes:(1) Resident aliens admitted under section 245A of the INA, (2) Resident alien-special agricultural workers admitted under section210 of the INA, and (3) Anticipated resident alien-replenishment agricultural workers admittedbetween FY 1990 and FY 1993 under section 210A of the INA. (i) ``Seasonal Agricultural Services'' as provided by section 210(h) ofthe Act means the ``performance of field work related to planting, culturalpractices, cultivating, growing and harvesting of fruits and vegetablesof every kind and other perishable commodities, as defined in regulationsby the Secretary of Agriculture.'' 8 U.S.C. 1160(h). The definitions promulgatedby the Secretary of Agriculture are located at 7 CFR part 1d, and are restatedfor informational purposes at 29 CFR 502.2(o)(2). (j) ``Secretaries'' for purposes of this part means the Secretary of theUnited States Department of Agriculture and the Secretary of the UnitedStates Department of Labor. (k) ``Shortage Number'' means the number, determined jointly by the Secretaries,of additional aliens who should be admitted to the United States or whoshould otherwise acquire the status of aliens lawfully admitted for temporaryresidence under section 210A of the INA to meet a shortage of workers toperform seasonal agricultural services in the United States during a specificFY. (l) ``Special Agricultural Worker (SAW)'' is: (1) An alien granted temporary resident alien status as a result of anapplication filed pursuant to section 210 of the INA, establishing residencein the United States and employment in seasonal agricultural services forat least 90 man-days (days in which at least one hour is worked) duringthe 12-month period ending May 1, 1986; and (2) A RAW granted temporary resident alien status pursuant to section 210Aof the INA. (m) ``Starting number'' is the number of individuals whose status has beenfinally adjudicated to that of SAWs under section 210 of the INA, as reportedto the Secretaries by the Director by September 1 of each FY. It is thebase number from which the annual numerical limitation is determined. (n) ``USDA'' means the United States Department of Agriculture. (o) ``Work-day'' means a calendar day during which at least 4 hours ofwork in seasonal agricultural services is performed. (<T2>Note:</T2> work-day is a term specific to the SAW/RAW program and carrieswith it employer reporting requirements under 29 CFR part 502.

The Secretaries have designated the Committeefor Employment Information on Special Agricultural Workers, 1201 East 10thStreet, Jeffersonville, lndiana 47132, as the entity to receive the reports.(b) The Director shall, before the end of each FY (beginning with FY 1989and ending with FY 1992), estimate the number of SAWs who have performedseasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 15 work-daysduring the FY. The Act further requires that the Director determine theaverage number of work-days worked in seasonal agricultural services bycertain of such workers who worked at least 15 work-days in seasonal agriculturalservices during the FY under consideration. (c) The Committee for Employment Information on Special Agricultural Workersshall furnish to the Director, in the form and manner specified by theDirector, information contained in the reports (ESA-92's) submitted byemployers. The Director shall base estimates of the number of SAWs workingin seasonal agricultural services and the average number of work-days workedby such SAWs on the information received from the Committee. (d) In making the estimates, the Director shall take into account (to theextent feasible) the underreporting or duplicate reporting on the numberof SAWs that may be occurring.

In doing so, the Secretaries will use information fromINS regarding the number of individuals whose status was finally adjudicated(approved) as SAWs under section 210 of the INA. In the event that INSis not able to make final determinations on all SAW applicants prior tothe beginning of FY 1990, the Secretaries will use the number of finaladjudications reported by INS to the Director as the ``starting number''for the calculation applicable to FY 1990. The Director will advise theSecretaries by September 1, 1989, of the number to be used in the calculation,based upon the latest available INS data. However, in the event INS isunable to complete its adjudication of all SAW applications by the endof FY 1989, the Secretaries, prior to the end of each of the followingfiscal quarters, will recalculate the annual numerical limitation by includingin the ``starting number'' all those aliens who the Director reports havebeen finally adjudicated as SAWs subsequent to any earlier determinationof the annual numerical limitation, and by adjusting the number of SAWswho worked in seasonal agricultural services to take into account the increasein the number of reportable workers who obtained SAW status. (b) Section 210A(b)(3)(i) of the INA requires that before the end of eachFY, beginning with FY 1989 and ending with FY 1992, the Director estimatethe number of SAWs (those individuals whose status was finally adjustedunder section 210 of the INA or who were admitted or whose status was adjustedunder section 2l0A of the INA) who performed seasonal agricultural servicesat any time (for at least 15 work-days) during the FY. The estimate ofthe Director will be determined pursuant to andSection;<T2>XXX</T2>.7 of this part and will be used by the Secretaries as specifiedin the formula for calculating the annual numerical limitation.(c) Section 210A(b)(1)(C) of the INA requires that the estimate of theDirector be increased or decreased to reflect any increase or decreasein the number of nonimmigrant aliens admitted to perform temporary seasonalagricultural labor (H-2A workers) in the FY, compared to the prior FY.The Secretaries will use the difference between the utilization of H-2Aworkers during FY 1989 compared to FY 1988 as the basis for adjusting theestimate of the Director of SAWs who worked in seasonal agricultural servicein FY 1989, and in each of the following FY's will use the change betweenthe current and prior years as the basis for adjusting the estimate ofthe Director. Specifically, if there is an increase in the utilizationof H-2A workers in FY 1989 compared to 1988, the amount of the increasewill be added to the estimate of the Director of the number of SAWs whoperformed seasonal agricultural services in FY l989. If there is a decreasein the utilization of H-2A workers, the amount of the decrease will besubtracted from the estimate of the Director. (d) For FY l990, the numerical limitation is: (1) 95 percent of the numberof individuals finally adjudicated as SAWs (described in paragraph (a)of this section as the ``starting number''), minus (2) the number of SAWswho performed seasonal agricultural services during FY 1989 as estimatedby the Director (as described above in paragraph (b) of this section),and as adjusted to reflect any change in the utilization of H-2A workersas described above in paragraph (c) of this section. (e) For FY 1991, the numerical limitation is: (1) 90 percent of the number determined in accordance with step 1 in paragraph(d) of this section (that is, 90 percent of 95 percent of the startingnumber, except, in the event that INS continues to adjust individuals toSAW status after the beginning of FY 1990, the additional SAWs will beadded to the starting number used for 1990 and the entire calculation willbe redone prior to the end of each fiscal quarter based upon the larger``starting number''), minus (2) The number of SAWs, including RAWs, who performed seasonal agriculturalservices during FY 1990 as estimated by the Director adjusted to reflectany change in the utilization of H-2A workers. (f) For FY 1992 and 1993, the numerical limitation is: (1) 90 percent of the number determined in accordance with step 1 for theprior FY (that is, for 1992, 90 percent of 90 percent of 95 percent ofthe starting number, except, in the event that INS continues to adjustindividuals to SAW status after the beginning of FY 1991, the additionalSAWs will again be added to the original ``starting number'' and the entirecalculation be redone prior to the end of each fiscal quarter. Similarlyfor 1993, if INS continues to adjust individuals to SAW status after thebeginning of FY 1992, the additional SAWs will be added to the ``startingnumber'' and the entire calculation redone prior to the end of each fiscalquarter by taking 90 percent of 90 percent of 90 percent of 95 percentof the starting number), minus (2) The number of SAWs, including RAWs, who performed seasonal agriculturalservices during the prior FY, adjusted to reflect any change in the utilizationof H-2A workers. (g) The Secretaries will also recalculate the annual numerical limitationpursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section,as appropriate, to incorporate the latest available information from INSand the Director, if the Secretaries grant an increase in the shortagenumber under andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.20 of this part and the annual numerical limitation is lowerthan the resulting shortage number. (h) Once INS and the Director advise the Secretaries that all applicationsfor SAW status have been finally adjudicated, the annual numerical limitationwill be determined once for each subsequent FY, prior to the end of thepreceding FY, and the number will be fixed for the entire FY. (i) The Secretaries will announce the annual numerical limitation in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> at the time the shortage number is announced.Subsequent additions to the starting number and annual numerical limitationwill be announced in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.
