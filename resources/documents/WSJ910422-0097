Canadian health groups predict that the government'sstringent tobacco regulations will cause smoking to fall 11%per capita this year, the biggest decline ever recorded by acountry. The tobacco industry doesn't dispute the figure. Thebiggest decline on record was a 10% drop in New Zealand in1989.</LP><TEXT>   The reduction would mean that Canadians would be smokingsignificantly less than Americans. They were heavier smokersas recently as 1989. Canadian per capita consumption was down28.5% in 1990 from 1984, compared with a 19.9% drop in theU.S.   Canada has become a &quot;test case&quot; for reducing smokingthrough government regulations, says E.R.C. StatisticsInternational Ltd., a British marketing research company. Itsays Canada's &quot;punitive&quot; tax measures and other laws make theCanadian tobacco industry's future look &quot;increasingly bleak.&quot;   The Canadian government raised tobacco sales taxes bythree Canadian cents (2.6 U.S. cents) per cigarette inFebruary, increasing federal sales taxes to about $1.60 for apack of 20. The tax boost raised cigarette prices 34.5% inMarch from a year earlier, to almost twice the price ofcigarettes in the U.S.   Since the latest federal tax increase, tobacco sales havedropped about 8%, says Norm Latowsky, president of UCS GroupLtd., an Imasco Ltd. unit that is one of Canada's largesttobacco retailers.   Sales are expected to decline further in coming months asmore provinces raise their taxes. New Brunswick recentlyraised its tobacco levies by about 30%, pushing up the priceof a carton of cigarettes in the province to about $49, oneof the highest prices in the world.   The projected drop in sales may finally put the squeeze onCanadian tobacco company profits. Cigarette makers have beenable to offset previous declines by raising prices andcutting costs. But Jack Stacey, an industry analyst with MossLawson andamp; Co., says that an 11% drop in sales may be too bigto cover in this way.   Federal and provincial sales taxes account for about 70%of the price of a package of cigarettes in Canada, comparedwith about 30% in the U.S. A pack of 20 cigarettes averagesabout $4.44 in Canada. The same Canadian pack sells for about$3 in the U.S., while a U.S.-made pack sells for about $2.50.   So many Canadians stock up on cigarettes in the U.S. thatCanadian brands account for about one-third of the sales at aMassena, N.Y., outlet of New York Periodicals, a cigar-storechain.   Smuggled cigarettes have become more widely available inCanadian cities since the latest federal tax increase.Figures aren't available on how much smuggling may haveincreased. Even before the latest rise in taxes, the RoyalCanadian Mounted Police estimated that Canadian federal andprovincial governments lost about $174 million in revenue ayear because of illegal sales of cigarettes.   Imperial Tobacco Ltd., which accounts for 60% of theCanadian cigarette market, said it is too early to assess theimpact of the new federal and provincial taxes. Imperial is asubsidiary of Imasco Ltd., a Montreal-based holding companythat is 40%-owned by B.A.T Industries PLC.   The rest of the Canadian market is shared by RJR-MacdonaldInc. and Rothmans, Benson andamp; Hedges Inc., both of Toronto.RJR-Macdonald is owned by RJR Nabisco Inc. Rothmans, Benson andamp;Hedges is 40% owned by Philip Morris Cos. of New York and60%-owned by Rothmans Inc. of Toronto, which in turn is71%-owned by Rothmans International PLC of Britain.   The Canadian government has also prohibited smoking ingovernment regulated buildings and banned cigaretteadvertising. It has phased out smoking on domestic airlineflights and is phasing it out on international flights. Laterthis year it plans to require that cigarette packages carrybigger health warnings on the outside and anti-smokingleaflets inside. Tobacco companies estimate that thesechanges will cost $34.8 million to implement.   A spokesman for Rothmans, Benson andamp; Hedges says thegovernment is using &quot;economic harassment&quot; against cigarettecompanies. The Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council saysthe government wants to tax them &quot;out of business.&quot;   Meanwhile, Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilsondescribed the latest tax increase as partly aimed at reducingthe habit. He estimated the higher prices will dissuade100,000 Canadian teen-agers from smoking.</TEXT></DOC>
