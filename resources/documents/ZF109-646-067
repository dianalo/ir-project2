 WORKSTATIONS: FUNCTION DRIVES THE CHOICEandM;As the line separating workstation prices and personal computer prices blurs,the choice between the two platforms has become less clear.andP;  At first glance,an MIS manager might buy a workstation with a purchase price that is lessthan that of an equivalently equipped PC.andP;  Conversely, with the growingnumber of high-end PCs available today, another MIS manager might be temptedto opt for PCs solely because PC application software is less expensive thanworkstation software.andM;Either scenario, however, could turn out to be a trap.andP;  For example,workstations carry hidden costs and PCs impose processing limitations thatcan make purchase-price comparisons misleading.andM;Despite the claims of various vendors' marketing campaigns, workstations andPCs remain entirely different animals, with different strengths andweaknesses.andP;  As a result, cost-justifying the purchase of workstations or PCsdepends largely on the applications involved.andM;For instance, MIS managers can run network-based applications andapplications that include three-dimensional graphics or production-designtools on both workstations and PCs.andP;  But in many cases, workstations'inherent strengths in these applications improve performance and productivitysufficiently to offset the workstations' higher price tags.andM;On the other hand, many office automation applications, such as spreadsheetsand small databases, point MIS managers toward PCs, which allows managers tomake the most efficient use of processing dollars because such applicationsdon't require the same level of horsepower as graphics applications.andM;United Bank of Switzerland (UBS) Securities, a securities company based inNew York, compares workstations and PCs to race cars and station wagons.andO;Like workstations, speedy race cars are seductively powerful, but are complexmachines that require expensive maintenance.andP;  Still, when conditions call forspeed and finesse, station wagons, like PCs, can't compare.andM;What station wagons and PCs lack in speed and sex appeal, however, they oftenmake up for as solid general-purpose vehicles that are easily andinexpensively maintained at any local service center.andP;  For the right set ofeveryday uses, PCs, like station wagons, can do quite nicely.andM;If MIS managers know they can use advanced computing capabilities effectivelyfor their current applications, they should definitely opt for workstations.andO;In addition to offering productivity boosts, workstations will providesavings in the long term.andP;  High-end PCs lack the CPU growth potential ofRISC-based workstations, which are improving at a much faster rate than IBMPCs and compatibles that use Intel CPUs.andM;Workstations and PCs will probably always be distinctly different computingplatforms.andP;  But price tag differences between the two platforms aredisappearing rapidly with workstation RISC processors riding a much steeperdownward price/performance curve than the CISC processors found in PCs.andM;Even today, as prices continue to diminish, the cost of obtainingequivalently capable PCs and workstations favors the latter.andP;  According toAlex Brown andamp; Sons, a stock brokerage based in Baltimore, a name-brand PC withan Intel 80386 processor, 4MB of memory, a floppy disk and hard disk storageof 120MB to 160MB is priced between $10,000 and $13,000.andM;If an MIS manager wants to endow that PC with workstationlike capabilities,which means 4MB more RAM, an 8-bit video card, a 13-inch or 16-inch colordisplay, an Ethernet interface, an extended keyboard, a mouse, windowingsoftware, and an operating system license, the price hits between $15,000 and$20,000.andM;On the other hand, the low end of the workstation market can out-power PCs inthe $15,000-to-$20,000 ballpark.andP;  For example, a Unix workstation equippedcomparably to a PC with workstation-class capabilities is priced just under$10,000.andM;This price/performance ratio is likely to continue to favor RISC/Unixsystems.andP;  According to a study conducted by Workgroup Technologies, a marketresearch company in Nashua, N.H., the average selling price last year for acolor Intel 80386-based PC was $10,625, whereas the average RISC workstationwent for $14,270.andM;By 1992, according to Workgroup Technologies, workstations and PCs will tradeplaces on the cost curve.andP;  By that time, the average workstation will bepriced at $8,373 and the average PC outfitted for CAD/CAE applications willrun $9,234.andP;  (See &quot;Workstations vs.andP;  PCs: Projected Average Purchase Price,&quot;page 29.)andM;However, many applications for which PCs are purchased, such as officeautomation packages, don't require the added CPU power needed to accommodateengineering tasks such as CAD or CAF.andP;  For these less complex applications, aPC may provide a better deal when total acquisition cost is taken intoaccount.andM;The hardware purchase price of a desktop system is only part of the story.andO;Costs associated with installation, support, software and training are muchhigher for workstations than for PCs.andM;In fact, although hardware is the major cost of a PC-based system, it isn'tthe major cost for workstations, according to research by Alex Brown andamp; Sons.andM;For a workstation, the first-year implementation cost alone, includinginstallation and maintenance, will run between 50 percent and 66 percent ofthe hardware expense, whereas implementing a PC solution involves spendingbetween 20 percent and 33 percent beyond original hardware costs, accordingto Alex Brown andamp; Sons.andP;  (See &quot;Workstations vs.andP;  PCs: Additional First-YearCosts,&quot; page 31.)andM;Moreover, application software for workstations is more expensive than forPCs, and adds to workstation costs.andP;  According to research by UBS Securities,workstation software prices are 50 percent to 100 percent higher than forcomparable PC software.andP;  The reason for the price differential is purelyeconomic: There are far fewer workstations out there to absorb the cost ofsoftware development.andM;Although increasing numbers of PC-DOS applications have been ported to Unix,software originally created for DOS platforms tends to be ported to PCsfirst.andP;  That gives PC users a distinct advantage over workstation users whenit comes to accessing the latest and greatest in commercial businessapplications.andM;Another factor affecting workstation costs is expensive maintenancecontracts, higher-paid support personnel and more costly replacement parts.andM;In general, MIS managers will spend a total of $42 million on PC andworkstation service and support this year, according to WorkgroupTechnologies.andP;  The 52 million PCs in the marketplace will account for 38percent of the support and service dollars, whereas the 3.3 millionworkstations out there will account for a whopping 62 percent.andM;This translates to an expenditure of $26 on outside workstation service andsupport for every $1 spent on outside PC support.andM;In reality, the preceding ratio is somewhat smaller because the WorkgroupTechnologies study didn't include money spent on internal support.andP;  PCservices are almost always provided internally, whereas companies are morelikely to sign a maintenance contract for workstation support.andM;In all likelihood, then, the total cost of ownership will remain lower forPCs than for workstations.andP;  But important as these price factors are to keepin mind, there's no disputing that workstations and PCs are best suited fordifferent sets of applications.andM;CAUGHT IN THE CROSSOVERandM;Part of the confusion that stems from trying to define the roles of PCs andworkstations is due to manufacturers trying to break into each others'markets.andM;PC manufacturers, eyeing the high prices of more powerful machines, want toscale up PCs to that more expensive level.andP;  Workstation manufacturers, inturn, covet the mass market available to PC manufacturers, especially givenworkstations' decreasing hardware costs.andM;Yet there are significant differences.andP;  To begin with, at the heart of eachmachine is a different type of processor.andP;  PCs generally use Intel's CISCmicroprocessors and run MS-DOS; workstations generally use RISC processorsand run some rendition of Unix.andM;Intel's 80386 and 80486 chips provide the type of processing power thattranslates into fast window redraws, which are fundamental to many PCapplications.andP;  On the other hand, applications requiring substantial computeperformance generally run best on RISC-based workstations.andM;For instance, users running production design tools, such as CASE, CAE orCAD/CAM, are probably better off with workstations.andP;  But users who primarilyrun terminal emulation software, a spreadsheet and a simple databaseapplication or two are candidates for PCs.andM;Similarly, users who tap into complicated labyrinths of high-speed networksand engage in numerous data transfers are likely workstation customers.andM;By contrast, if users are part of a small work group that doesn't exchangecomplex information frequently, PCs would meet the group's needs nicely.andM;Although some variants of Unix are designed for the Intel chip on which PCsare based, and though OS/2 is a multitasking PC operating system, most PCsare sold as stand-alone machines running the MS-DOS operating system.andP;  FewPCs are purchased for the multiuser, multitasking environments thatworkstations call home.andM;Unix supports true multitasking and virtual memory, whereas DOS does not.andO;Users who need large amounts of memory and need to run several programs atonce will complete their work faster via Unix.andM;In addition, the Unix operating system and applications written specificallyfor Unix make good use of the integrated graphics, networking, large amountsof memory and substantial CPU power of workstations.andM;For instance, workstation displays provide an average of 1 million pixels,whereas PC VGA graphics displays average about one-third of that resolution.andO;A workstation's high resolution is necessary for users who need to put largeamounts of information on screen at once or who require exceptional pictureclarity.andM;Workstations are therefore more suitable for applications that make effectiveuse of high-end graphics capabilities and large amounts of memory, such asthree-dimensional modeling and animation, particularly when network usersneed to share the applications.andM;Workstations also provide more sophisticated development environments thanPCs because of their superior software libraries and computing speed.andO;Indeed, developers working on their own PC software are likely to do so onworkstations, despite the added cost of porting the finished applications tothe PCs.andM;Workstations are also being used increasingly for mission-critical commercialapplications that may not need nifty graphics but require the substantialcomputing power and high data communications speed afforded by workstations.andM;For instance, a stockbroker's desktop machine must handle diverse sets ofnumbers arriving from numerous sources, and relay answers based on thosenumbers to users as quickly as possible.andP;  Because a moment's delay can meanthe loss of thousands of dollars, such users need superior CPU power and arewilling to pay a premium for it.andM;Of course, PCs have their place and time.andP;  DOS platforms typically offergraphical user interfaces (GUIs) that are easier to use than workstationGUIs, though even that difference is eroding as more robust workstation GUIsmake their way into the commercial marketplace.andM;In addition, DOS platforms are easier to maintain than workstations.andO;Compared with Unix, DOS offers a simpler environment that facilitatesmaintenance and troubleshooting.andP;  Similarly, PCs are generally employed insmall networks with limited file-and peripheral-sharing requirements, asystem and network maintenance environment that's vastly simpler and easierto manage than most workstation habitats.andM;Finally, the overwhelming presence of PCs has made PC maintenance andmanagement expertise relatively easy to come by--and pay for.andP;  For thesevarious reasons, MIS managers who don't absolutely need workstation-classpower are clearly better off buying PCs.andM;PARTING OF WAYSandM;Vendors' grand marketing designs notwithstanding, inherent distinctionsbetween workstations and PCs will likely keep the two platforms in separatemarkets.andP;  The physical distinctions between the machines, their divergentsupport requirements and the differences in their application suitabilitydictate different distribution channels for the two types of machines.andM;What all this means is that applications are the bottom line when it comes tochoosing desktop computing devices.andP;  And it's up to MIS managers to definewhich systems best suit their needs.andP;  By carefully defining the intended usesfor their desktop machines, MIS managers can make informed and intelligentpurchasing decisions.andM;If their needs would be well-served by the software available for DOSmachines, and if they don't need the powerful computation and high-speednetworking capabilities offered by today's workstations, MIS managers canfeel comfortable--and save money--with PCs.andM;On the other hand, when applications call for superior integrated graphicscapabilities, the raw power of a RISC CPU and Unix's advanced networkingcapabilities, workstations are the vehicle of choice.andM;And in such cases, workstations typically prove less expensive and moreeffective than trying to outfit a PC to do a workstation's work.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
