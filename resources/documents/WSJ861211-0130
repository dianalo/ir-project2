The graphic arts concern said the extended offer will expire at 12:01 a.m. EST Dec. 19. Previously, the offer was set to end at 12:01 a.m. EST next Tuesday. Lehigh said it agreed to the extension to permit a federal court hearing set for next Tuesday on a previously reported motion by a shareholder group to block the proposed buyout.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    (Revised WSJ Dec. 15, 1986)</TEXT></DOC>
