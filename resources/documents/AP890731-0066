They also reiterated their offer made earlier today to trade allIsrael's Shiite Moslem captives for all captured Israeli soldiersand foreign hostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon.   A pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said itexecuted Lt. Col. William R. Higgins today after a deadline passedfor their demand that the abducted cleric be released.   Higgins was head of an unarmed U.N. observer group in Lebanonwhen he was abducted in February 1988 in south Lebanon.   ``At this point, we have no confirmation that, indeed, ColonelHiggins was murdered,'' said Avi Pazner, spokesman for PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir.   ``We have to be very cautious with a possible reaction becauseyou remember a year ago the same organization said that theyexecuted Col. Higgins after the accidental shooting-down of anIranian airplane by the U.S. Navy.   ``So we will have to look for further evidence to confirm wheresuch an odious and criminal act has been perpetrated,'' he told TheAssociated Press.   Sources in Lebanon have said the United Nations receivedunconfirmed reports earlier this year that Higgins was killed afteran Iranian airliner was shot down by a U.S. warship on July 3, 1988.   Spokesmen for Israel's defense and foreign ministries refused tocomment immediately on the report of Higgins' death.   In making the Israeli offer today, Defense Minister YitzhakRabin said, ``Israel repeats its call for the release of Israeliand other hostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon. Israel isoffering to trade prisoners, detainees and hostages.''   His statement to reporters in Tel Aviv, read from a preparedtext, was also broadcast on state-run Israel radio. Pazner latersaid the offer was made on behalf of the government.   ``According to this proposal, all the Israeli prisoners andforeign hostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon would be swappedfor all the Shiite prisoners kept by Israel, including Sheik AbdelKarim Obeid, Jawad Kasfi and others,'' Rabin said.   He said such an exchange would be conducted through theInternational Red Cross.   Pazner said the offer stands despite the claim that Higgins hadbeen executed.   Obeid is an influential Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped byIsraeli commandos Friday in south Lebanon, and Kasfi is anotherLebanese Shiite seized by Israeli forces in Lebanon last December.   Obeid is the reputed spiritual leader of the Shiite MoslemHezbollah militia in south Lebanon, the umbrella group for factionsbelieved to be holding 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon. Nine areAmerican.   Security sources estimate 50 to 60 Shiite Moslems from Lebanonare held in Israeli prisons.   The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia, which helpspatrol Israel's self-declared security zone in south Lebanon, holdsabout 300 Shiites in a prison at Khiam in south Lebanon. It was notimmediately clear if this group would be part of the deal.   Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres had said earlier today thatIsraeli officials hoped Obeid could be swapped for three Israelisoldiers missing in Lebanon since 1986 and believed held byHezbollah.</TEXT></DOC>
