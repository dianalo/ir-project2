(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Technology's Rewards Without the RisksandM;Planning for changes in the information technology infrastructure can be aprecarious function for IS managers.andP;  Bet on a technology that seems to berevolutionary but turns out to be ordinary, and your enterprise pays a bigprice--in dollars, dismay and disillusionment.andP;  Miss a technology that trulycan transform the enterprise, and it pays even higher costs--usually at thehands of a competitor that caught onto the technology in time.andM;But planning is harder than ever today, despite the fact that standards aremaking the future direction of information technology much easier to predict.andO;Two forces are complicating things for IS planners.andP;  One is the acceleratingpace of product development from leading technology suppliers--a pace madeall the quicker by the globalization of markets.andP;  Not a week goes by, itseems, that one supplier or another isn't claiming to have a new productsurpassing a previous-generation system in price and performance by a factorof two, three, four or more.andM;The other complicating factor is the widening proliferation of technologyinto the enterprise.andP;  Not a day goes by, for sure, that an end user or abusiness unit manager isn't suggesting the enterprise take a look at a newapplication.andM;Clearly, many enterprises aren't prepared to deal with significant andfundamental changes in technology.andP;  The reason is usually philosophical.andO;Many IS managers believe their enterprises are better off bypassing newtechnologies until they are proven safe in the marketplace.andP;  But businessreality demands that such managers think and act otherwise.andP;  They must thinkof new technologies not just in technical terms but in competitive ways.andP;  Iftheir enterprises wait too long to explore and take advantage offundamentally new technologies, those competitors that move more quickly touse these new tools will be the victors.andM;Here's a model that may prevent you from being vanquished.andP;  It's based on theassumption that new classes of tenchology (such as local area networks andhighly parallel computers) or a substantial change in a current technology(such as in PCs or in relational database management systems) require adifferent approach to cost/benefit analysis and implementation than do newversions of existing technologies.andM;The model functions through the efforts of an IS planning team whose membersare small in number but deep in talent.andP;  Leading the team should be an ISprofessional with architectural responsibilities--somebody who knows thattype of information structure the enterprise is building.andP;  Supporting theleader should be one or two technicians who can fully comprehend what impacta technology might have on their enterprise's resources.andM;Assisting the leader, too, should be a financial or business analyst who canfu lly gauge the impact of the technology on the enterprise in dollar andbusiness terms.andP;  THe most important member of the team, however, should comefrom outside the IS ranks--a member of the enterprise whose department offunction will most likely be affected first by the technology.andM;Strategy for IntroductionandM;Communications is a major responsibility for any IS planning team--one itshould keep in mind during all phases of evaluating and introducing newtechnology.andP;  Clearly and simply relaying the significance of a majortechnological advancement to the entire organization will alert everyone toits possible impact, allowing them to prepare for and minimize any disruptionthat may occur.andP;  If the new technology proves valuable, changes will berequired in organization structure, peoples' skills and tasks to takeadvantage of it.andP;  The timing of these enterprise-level changes must be linkedto the timing of the technology's introduction.andM;As the IS planning team and other IS practitioners ride the learning curvefor the new technology, there are logical times for exposing others to it.andO;These times, where both management approval and commitment are required toproceed further, occur at the end of three distinct phases: Research,Evaluation, Innovation.andP;  The fourth phase, Exploitation, marks the fullintegration of the technology.andP;  The fifth, Decommission, marks the end of onetechnology cycle and the beginning of another.andM;What Goes on in ResearchandM;The Research Phase of new technology implementation is generally carried outby the IS planning team or experts assinged by the team.andM;Its charge, at this point, is to scrutinize new products to determine whetherthey represent product change or process changE.andP;  What's the difference?andO;Incremental product changes represent new versions of existing technologies.andO;Major process changes signal new classes of technologies that providesignificant new functional specifications.andP;  New technologies typicallycompete with preceding products on the basis of superior functionalspecifications rather than lower initial cost.andM;The difference is important because it will determine the way thecost/benefit analysis is approached, as well as the way the tehnology shouldbe introduced.andM;For process change, the IS planning team must assess whether a particulartechnology meets the enterprise's information needs and whether its adoptionwill change the enterprise's organizational structure.andP;  The team also mustmeasure the technical and competitive risks associated with the technology.andO;It may decide to ignore the technology altogether.andM;If the IS planning team decides not to ignore the technology, it shouldconsider just how much it wants to commit the enterprise's resources to thattechnology.andP;  Assigning the technology a 0 commitment level signifies that theorganization has no prior exposure or experience with the technology.andP;  The 0grade also indicates that the team doesn't expect to deliver any solutionsbased on th is technology in the immediate future.andP;  The 0 value is not meantto be denigrating.andP;  Rather it's intended to establish an accepted environmentwhere a basic understanding of the technology can be gained at no cost orrisk.andM;A technology that shows enough merit to warrant further investigation shouldbe moved up a level to 1.andP;  The IS planning team should now begin to developan idea of how its enterprise might use the technology--particularly from acompetitive standpoint.andP;  The team also should prepare a rought cost/benefitanalysis of the technology that offers an early view of its tangible orintangible benefits.andM;Efforts at level 1 research are minimally funded.andP;  Nevertheless, they areserious enough for the planning team to seek input from other individuals inthe enterprise.andP;  The team should review business issues related to thetechnology with key enterprise managers.andP;  In this way, the team determineswhether such managers would be willing to commit to a strategy for using thetechnology.andP;  In doing such reviews, team members should strive to motivateand stimulate managers (who really will become customers of the technology)to rethink their needs and explore new potential the technology can bring tothe business.andM;The goal of the IS planning team conducting level 1 research should be tosecure management commitment for a controlled evaluation of the newtechnology in the next phase, Evaluation.andP;  The team should prepare a reportfor management that outlines anticipated opportunities and risks inherent inthe technology.andP;  It even should report on a technology that it has decided toabandon.andM;If the technology is going to be pursued further, the team's report tomanagement should include a project plan for the next phase of the process.andO;The plan must estimate resources needed, painting a matrix of who will beinvolved in evaluating the technology, when they will do so and how muchtheir activities will cost.andP;  This material forms the basis for soliciting andobtaining organizational commitment to proceed to the Evaluation Phase, wherethe technology is tested in full view of the enterprise.andM;Who Should Evaluate TechnologyandM;The Evaluation Phase is an experimental period during which the assumptionsabout a technology developed during the Research Phase are tested.andP;  The ISplanning team should assign some of its members and enlist others from theenterprise to form an evaluation team.andP;  It, is turn should focus on:andM;* Testing the functional specification of the technology that may allowreplacement of an existing technology;andM;* Experimenting with the new functional set;andM;* Seeking new views from the enterprise on how and where to apply thetechnology;andM;* Determining the service requirements, reliability and availability of thetechnology;andM;* Identifying a few (but not all) new or existing applications that can besupported or enhanced by the new technology.andM;PLANNINGandM;To set management expectations, the evaluation team (reporting through the ISplanners) should clearly state the reasons for any changes needed in theenterprise to test the new technology in trial applications.andP;  The trialsthemselves should focus on the interface aspects of the technology--how wellit fits into the technical infrastructure of the enterprise and how wellusers of the technology are able to manage it.andM;Minimizing risk to the enterprise during technology trials is paramount.andP;  Theevaluation team should endeavor to conduct its experiments in a parallel modeas much as possible, separating the new technology from the criticalproduction environment of the enterprise itself.andM;The evaluation team's biggest task during this phase is to identifyassumptions, policies and processes associated with current technologies thatwill no longer make sense with a new technology.andP;  Once that is done, the teamcan proceed with determining how to position the existing technical andorganizational structures (or reposition them, if necessary) for theintroduction of the technology and any follow-on improvements.andM;Knowledge, imagination and commitment characterize the next phase of themodel.andP;  In the Innovation Phase, the IS planning team learns inside and outthe functional specifications of a technology.andP;  It tries to imagine everypossible use of the technology within the enterprise based on the informationgained during the evaluation phase.andP;  And it makes a commitment to initiate aproject to bring the technology into the enterprise.andM;The choice of the project itself is crucial to the technology's acceptance.andO;Although the project should be limited to just one major application withinthe enterprise, it should provide a base of knowledge and experience that canbe applied in several other areas of the enterprise.andM;One big issue raised by a new technology is the set of functions it promisesto deliver--in both technical and business terms.andP;  The IS planning team mustrigorously test the technology to determine its optimal configuration, whichinvolves not only performance, capacity and support requirements butenterprise-related effects as well.andP;  How will the technology affect business?andO;What new processes will it enable?andP;  When will the enterprise realize a fullreturn on its technology investment?andM;Where Innovation CountsandM;In this phase, the IS planning team is in a good position to make anytechnology-driven enhancements to organizational processes, a finalcost/benefit analysis of the technology itself and a determination of howwidespread the technology can be within the enterprise.andP;  The team'srecommendations to management should take the form of a written projectreport, including input from all enterprise managers affected by thetechnology.andM;If management deems the project a success and understands its importance tothe greater enterprise, it should be ready to commit to full deploymentwherever appropriate.andP;  If management thinks otherwise, it should ask the ISplanning team to make sure that the necessary actions are taken to minimizethe impact of the technology on the rest of the enterprise.andP;  The team andmanagement should make sure they have a clear undeerstanding of why atechnology failed--particularly this late in the process.andM;How To Fully Exploit TechnologyandM;The commitment to deploy involves far greater numbers of people than thosepreviously exposed to the technology.andP;  It provides a change for the fulltechnical and applications staffs to increase their knowledge of thetechnology.andP;  It allows mainstream organizational entities within theenterprise to begin using the new technology tool and to change any necessarystructures or processes to accommodate it.andM;The IS planning team's job isn't over, however.andP;  It must assume the role ofthe Great Communicator, pointing out to all parts of the enterprise where thetechnology can improve competitiveness.andP;  The team's goal isn't just to obtainconfirmation that the technology fits the enterprise at a cost that benefitsit.andP;  The planners should also be seeking to secure final managementcommitment to proceed with integrating the technology into the enterprise'sexisting information-technology infrastructure.andM;The fourth phase, Exploitation, probably lasts longer than all others.andP;  Itbegins as the technology is being fully integrated into the enterprise andends when the next new class of technology displaces the current one.andP;  It issometimes known as the Production Phase, and it's here that applicationsprogrammers and technicians can include th new technoloogy in the standardset of Is options available to the enterprise for addressing businessopportunities.andM;When To Say GoodbyeandM;As straightward as most IS planning teams are at embracing new technologyusing this model, few have a formula for parting with it.andP;  The DecommissionPhase almost appears unique to each enterprise.andP;  Many times, the technologyis simply used so little that, one day, an enterprise recognizes that thetechnology is not critical to any process or system.andP;  The technology thenfades away or someone removes it--sometimes painfully for those ISprofessionals or enterprise managers who once championed it.andM;In most cases, however, the champions take heart that the model they followedworked for their enterprise.andP;  They pride themselves in being able tointroduce innovation into their enterprise without exposing their companiesto undue risk.andP;  They feel victorious, not vanquished.andM;Gary H. Cox is director of customer services for the Hartford ComputerExchange Inc.andP;  He was formerly director of the Data Center TechnologyDivision of the Connecticut-based Hartford Insurance Group.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
