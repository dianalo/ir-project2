Under the change, investors can ask the agency toprivatize a business, bypassing the sometimes uncooperativemanagement committees of the state-owned concerns, said LajosCsepi, the agency's director.</LP><TEXT>   The agency also is willing to replace managementcommittees if they don't cooperate with privatizationefforts, he said.   &quot;In principle, a hostile takeover is possible, but we wantto discourage it,&quot; Mr. Csepi said. Once an investor hasapproached the agency with a firm offer, Mr. Csepi said, hehopes a case can be completed within four months.   Streamlining is necessary, he conceded. In the 10 monthssince the agency was created to sell most of the country's2,300 state-owned firms, it has gone through two chiefs, fouroffice moves, four telephone-number changes and countlessfine-tunings of philosophies.   Spurred by public criticism and talks with theInternational Monetary Fund, Gyorgy Matolcsy, thegovernment's top economic adviser, in November goaded theagency into its latest changes. Mr. Matolcsy told the agencythat inefficient companies that are draining the government'scoffers should be liquidated and viable state-owned companiesshould be sold quickly to reduce the 1.3 trillion forint($18.4 billion) internal debt.   Mr. Csepi said criticism of the pace is &quot;justified becauseprivatization is a determining sector of the transformationof Hungarian life&quot; from a centrally planned socialist economyto a market-led one.   Still, he worries that hurried sales could hurt thestate's chances of getting the best prices possible.   In 1991, 400 firms are projected to be privatized. Lastyear, 130 were privatized, and 60 other cases are beingcompleted, Mr. Csepi said.   The agency also hopes to simplify the process; startingsoon, review by government ministries is being limited.   Before they can be privatized, some state-owned firms needto be restructured so that their viable parts can be spun offand sold for the best prices. Other firms lost their marketas trading within Comecon, the old Soviet-bloc tradingorganization, collapsed last year with the fall of Communistgovernments throughout the region. These firms need time tocreate markets to look attractive to investors, Mr. Csepisaid.   The Hungarian economy is weakening, a situation made worseby the Persian Gulf war. Enterprises struggling to survive inthe wake of new competition and lost Comecon markets could bedealt a death blow if energy prices continue to climb.   &quot;We hope even bankrupt companies can be privatized -- forthe real estate, if nothing else,&quot; Mr. Csepi said.   Privatization will yield between 40 and 50 billion forintsin 1991, according to preliminary government estimates. About85% of that will be used to reduce state debt. The rest willstock the country's employment fund, promote foreign capitaland establish a stock exchange compensation fund.   &quot;We're trying to create a balance between not blocking themomentum and not wanting the state to be taken advantage of,&quot;said Bryan Fischer, spokesman for the State Property Agency.   It hasn't been easy. The program is plagued by moneyproblems, unclear property laws and suspicions of foreignbusinesses based on certain past transactions. Before thestate agency was created to oversee privatization, forexample, HungarHotels made an agreement with Quintas in whichthe Swedish concern was to purchase 51.6% of HungarHotels'stock for the equivalent of $150 million -- which governmentofficials decided was a small fraction of the Hungarian hotelchain's market value.   The government managed to block the sale at the lastminute and has insisted on scrutinizing every proposal sincethen. It requires a company valuation by an internationallyrecognized firm for every sale and strongly encouragescompetitive bidding.   The state also learned that its bureaucrats need moresophistication in dealing with Western businessmen, skillsthat must be learned, or imported.   &quot;Expertise {within the agency} is not in abundance, andcompanies themselves aren't prepared to present themselves toinvestors in the most advantageous way,&quot; Mr. Fischer said.   Still, privatization in Hungary would be impossiblewithout foreign capital. In principle, foreigners can buymost of what Hungary privatizes. In practice, however,government officials fear the state's best tidbits will beeaten up by foreigners. Mr. Csepi said the agency is tryingto determine where foreign ownership will be restricted. Thegovernment probably will continue to hold a controlling stakein basic financial institutions and in utilities and theenergy sector, he said.   But for Hungarians to take part in privatization, theyneed money. And money is running short. To help them buystate property, the government set up two large credit fundsthrough which would-be entrepreneurs can get loans atbelow-market interest rates.   Marta Kismarty, head economist at Budapest Bank Ltd., saidcredit funds aren't enough, that it's bad economics to starta business deep in debt. &quot;Aid would be better,&quot; she said.&quot;But where would it come from?&quot;   An even greater problem is unclear property laws thatallow claims to be staked by the government, by managementcouncils acting on behalf of the state, by workers or byformer owners whose property was confiscated by theCommunists.   &quot;From an investor's perspective, it's a very big problem,&quot;said Alex Romer-Lee, managing partner of Coopers andamp; Lybrand inBudapest. &quot;Would you be willing to set up a company worthmillions of dollars when you're not certain who owns thecompany?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
