LEVI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man arrested during a raid on a printingplant may be responsible for the millions of dollars in counterfeitU.S. currency now flooding Mexico, the attorney general's officesaid Thursday.   The Bank of Mexico told Mexicans on Wednesday not to buy U.S.dollars from strangers and advised currency dealers to be on thelookout for bogus bills.   ``We're still investigating. But the evidence we have up to nowis that the whole thing appears to be connected to the Chihuahuacase,'' spokesman Fernando Arias of the attorney general's officesaid in a telephone interview.   Federal police seized about $11 million in bogus U.S. dollars innorthern Chihuahua state last week and arrested a foreigner who saidhe sent counterfeit money to Colombia, home of the notoriousMedellin drug cartel, to buy cocaine for eventual export and sale.   Law enforcement agents have been confiscating fake bills almostweekly since December, authorities said Thursday.   They said the latest case arose Tuesday in the Pacific coastresort of Acapulco, where agents arrested a peasant named JesusGomez Hernandez as he allegedly tried to change 20 fake $100 billsfor pesos at a foreign currency exchange house.   Gomez said he bought the bills in Morelos state from a stranger,the Guerrero state attorney general's office said.   On Saturday, agents confiscated $5 million in bogus bills andarrested at least four people in raids in Tijuana, across the borderfrom San Ysidro, Calif.   Authorities suspect the source of the counterfeit may be aforeigner arrested during a printing plant raid in Chihuahua. He andeight Mexicans were arrested Saturday in Ciudad Juarez, across theborder from El Paso, Texas.   Federal agents seized at least $11 million in fake $10, $20 and$50 bills which Deputy Attorney General Javier Coello Trejodescribed as ``almost perfect.''   Coello told reporters the man passed about $100,000 worth ofphony bills to an El Paso bank. He also told authorities of hiscounterfeit-for-cocaine efforts.   Authorities say the man had documents in several names, includingNewton Peter von Gramm and Newton Peter von Shultz. They believe heis either a U.S. citizen, a German or a Canadian.</TEXT></DOC>
