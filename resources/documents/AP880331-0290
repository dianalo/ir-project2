The pact ends six weeks of on-again, off-again acquisitionnegotiations.   An earlier, $17-per-share bid by the management group, headed byPIP's chief executive Thomas Marotto, was permitted to expire twoweeks ago when the company entered into talks with an unidentifiedthird party that was offering $17.50 per share, or $68.25 million.   However, PIP said Thursday that ``serious questions arose as tothe firmness of that offer'' and Marotto's group boosted its bid.   PIP has 3.9 million shares outstanding.   Marotto's group includes the Chicago-based investment firm ofGolder Thoma andamp; Cressey, which specializes in leveraged buyouts inwhich the assets of the firm being acquired are pledged ascollateral to line up takeover financing.   PIP has about 1,000 printing centers in the United States,Canada and the United Kingdom, all but a few of them franchised.   Last year, the company escaped a hostile bid by Tarrytown,N.Y.-based Kane-Miller Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
