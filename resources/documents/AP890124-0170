KennethMundy, Barry's attorney.   ``I'm stronger than ever before,'' Barry said after histwo-and-one-half hour appearance. When asked if he was a target ofthe investigation, he responded, ``absolutely not.''   Federal officials refused comment on Barry's appearances, buthave said before they are trying to determine if the mayor thwarteda police drug probe in late December. The grand jury is alsoexamining the mayor's role in a joint personnel project involvingthe city and Virgin Islands government.   Police were called back from a Dec. 22 attempt to buy drugs fromthe suspect, Charles Lewis, after Barry turned up in Lewis' room ata dowtown Ramada Inn. Barry has since acknowledged making severalcalls to police investigating the incident, but said he was onlytrying to speed up their inquiry.   Lewis also headed the $260,000 joint personnel project for theVirgin Islands government, but was fired from his post last Aprilafter Virgin Islands officials became concerned about cost overruns.Barry and other top city aids ran up hotel bills in the Virginislands of more than $37,000 while working on the plan.   Mundy said Barry is unlikely to be called before the panel again,but the mayor was served with a subpoeana that requested all of histelephone records, schedules, and daily diaries for December, whichcovers the time period when Lewis was in the Washington area. Thegrand jury is also seeking all phone messages dating back to Sept.15.   All the requested material will be turned over to the grand juryas soon as possible, Mundy said.</TEXT></DOC>
