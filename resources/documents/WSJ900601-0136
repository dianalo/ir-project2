The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,a club of 24 wealthy countries, also said in the communiqueat the end of its annual meeting that recent changes inEastern Europe affirm Western democratic values and improve&quot;the prospect of a truly integrated global economic system.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Although pleased with recent economic growth, the OECDsaid that to ensure continued expansion, furtherinternational economic cooperation and action is needed tolower inflation, reduce unemployment, cut trade and paymentimbalances, promote stable exchange markets, sustaininvestment and -- where appropriate -- encourage highersavings.   The U.S. in particular is eager to boost its savings rate.&quot;There is a world shortage of funds,&quot; Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady told reporters at a breakfast meeting, andexpressed his belief that current U.S. budget negotiationswould &quot;put savings back in the pool.&quot;   The OECD statement, which is something of a primer forissues that may be raised in Houston during the July summitof the leaders of the seven major industrial nations, clearlyidentified the areas that need to be negotiated to achieve asolid global-trade agreement. It called for greaterintegration of environmental considerations into economicdecision-making, and welcomed negotiations aimed at cuttingthe use of so-called tied-aid credits. Such subsidizedcredits are used by nations to win business for theircompanies.   The OECD countries, which include the U.S., Japan andWestern European nations, also said that &quot;every effort shouldbe made to eliminate or bring under enhanced discipline&quot;trade-distorting industrial subsidies, and indicated thatthey will try to achieve this goal through the current talksunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.   A successful outcome of the GATT round has &quot;the highestpriority on the international economic agenda,&quot; the OECDcommunique said. The group also firmly committed itself tothe broadening of the GATT treaty that is being sought in thecurrent Uruguay Round of trade talks, named for the countrywhere the negotiations began in 1986.   This broadening would extend the GATT, which has 97 membercountries, to cover services, trade-related investment,agriculture, textiles, and intellectual property -- such assoftware and copyrights. It also will entail ensuring thatdeveloping nations are properly integrated into the GATT andoffered the benefits of open markets -- particularly intextiles and agriculture -- along with the disciplines ofstrengthened trade rules and dispute-settlement mechanisms.Until now, the GATT has primarily covered tariffs in theindustrialized world.   But this broad boost for the GATT was jarred by a sharpdisagreement over agricultural subsidies between the U.S.,backed by Canada, Australia and New Zealand, on one side andthe 12 European Community nations on the other. The ECrefused to address export subsidies specifically, but offeredto address all agricultural subsidies in the aggregate.   As a result, the OECD's final statement included twoversions of what should be done to revamp agricultural tradefundamentally. The U.S. and its allies &quot;feel thatnegotiations should proceed to seek specific policycommitments in each area of the negotiations: internalsupport, barriers to market access and export subsidies,&quot; thecommunique said. But EC nations &quot;prefer to seek reductions insupport and protection with commitments encompassing allmeasures affecting import access and export subsidies.&quot;   U.S. leaders were blunt about the dispute. &quot;It would beeasy to paper over the differences, but that wouldn't advancethe cause,&quot; said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter. &quot;It'stime to let the world know that there are major differences,and cause people to focus on them.&quot; There won't be a GATTagreement on agriculture &quot;unless the European Community isprepared to be more forthcoming on export subsidies,&quot; Mr.Yeutter told reporters.   Speaking for the U.S.-led group, Trade RepresentativeCarla Hills said export subsidies are &quot;the most pernicious&quot;form of agricultural subsidies as they lead to immenseoverproduction and widespread international dumping. This inturn causes big distortions in agricultural trade thatparticularly disadvantage other food exporters, includingmany developing countries.   The EC wasn't giving any ground, though. It &quot;attachesgreat importance to maintaining certain price and supplystability in the interest of both producers and consumers,&quot;said Ray MacSharry, the EC's senior agricultural official.Exports subsidies, he said, are &quot;an integral part&quot; of theEC's price system.   The OECD isn't in doubt about the cost of agriculturalsubsidies. In its communique, the group said that altogetherthey cost OECD taxpayers and consumers $245 billion in 1989,a decline from $280 billion in 1988, but still higher thanfor any year before 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
