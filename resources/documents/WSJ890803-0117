The car, which carries a base price of $17,900, has the first tilt steering wheel ever on a VW model. Standard equipment includes power windows, mirrors and door locks, as well as air conditioning, all previously sold mainly as options.    The equipment represents a victory for VW officials in the U.S., who have labored to persuade their West German bosses to stop shipping cars with stark appointments to compete against well-equipped Japanese vehicles. After spurning such requests for years, VW executives now see Japanese auto makers poised to invade the European market and are starting to get the message. To increase the focus on customer demands, they recently imported U.S. management guru Tom Peters, co-author of &quot;In Search of Excellence,&quot; to address their corporate management conference in Barcelona, Spain.    The Corrado also employs the first engine supercharger that VW has ever sold in the U.S. -- which gives the 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine 158 horsepower and a top speed of 140 miles an hour. &quot;The Corrado is a way to get people thinking about Volkswagen again,&quot; says William J. Young, vice president for the U.S. sales unit. &quot;But we're trying to completely rebuild our franchise, and the only way to do that is to get more from our high-volume models.&quot;    The Corrado won't be among them. At full production, VW can make only 36,000 of the cars each year, and just 10,000 a year will reach the U.S. The company's two mainstays, the Golf and Jetta models, won't get a complete overhaul until 1992. But VW hopes the Corrado will be an image-maker and allow it to compete against the likes of Toyota Motor Corp.'s Celica, Nissan Motor Co.'s 240SX and Ford Motor Co.'s Probe GT.    After reaching a peak 7% share of the U.S. car market and outselling all other imports combined in 1970, VW clung to just 1.5% of the market last year. This year, the company's first-half sales plummeted 25% below a year earlier. Worse yet, VW is trying to resurrect itself against the heaviest competition ever in the U.S. Last year, even newcomer Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea outsold VW by more than 96,000 cars.    Volkswagen's woes have been legion. The cars carry high U.S. price tags in their segment, stemming partly from the dollar's decline from three years ago. The company's product cycles are long; by time the Golf and Jetta are revamped, they'll be about eight years old, nearly the length of three cycles for Japanese cars.    Then there's been bad luck and bad planning. The Volkswagen Fox subcompact was originally brought to the U.S. from Brazil in 1986 as VW's latest attempt to market an entry-level car. But rampant Brazilian inflation sent Fox prices soaring and Volkswagen failed to offer an optional automatic transmission.    The company's continuing decline has severely pinched VW dealers. John Campbell, a big Southern California dealer, says his VW sales have dropped 30% to 40% this year because &quot;we have a number of models that are stale and have fallen off the charts.&quot; Adds Robert LaTorre, a Reseda, Calif., dealer: &quot;We're suffering from a lack of new products. Every year it seems like we're selling something we had a hard time selling the year before at a lower price. We need some pizazz.&quot;    The Corrado can provide that, with its acceleration from zero to 60 miles an hour in 7.5 seconds. Dealers are pleased, but wanted the car sooner. It was supposed to arrive in the U.S. last March, but was held back for engine-mount modifications.    Early next year, VW dealers will get another new model: the Passat, a midsized sedan that will compete against the Nissan Maxima. Like the Corrado, it's expected to be priced below $20,000 -- far higher than VW's traditional selling ground, but below what VW's U.S. sales officials feared headquarters might demand. &quot;We have to get back to our roots of selling affordable cars,&quot; says Mr. Young, &quot;instead of cars people buy when they can't afford a BMW.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
