MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Terry Anderson is two weeks into his fifthyear as a hostage in Beirut and business is proceeding about asusual, which means that none is evident.   For the hostages, business as usual means only waiting.   Now that the four-year anniversary observances are over, thehostage issue is back on the back burner, an agonizing, frustratingriddle in which nine Americans are held captive and silent byMoslem extremists who are themselves silent most of the time.   After a Capitol Hill ceremony on the Anderson anniversary date,March 16, there were going to be yellow ribbons on display aroundCongress, and a resolution seeking action to end the hostageordeal, although no specific step was or could be proposed.   Neither ribbons nor resolutions are in evidence. Not that theywould change the situation, but it has dragged now to the point atwhich symbols become substitutes for acts no one has been able todevise.   President Bush suggested as he took office two months ago thatmoves by Iran to assist the hostages, to establish contact and helpgain their release, would be a significant step toward a time ofbetter relations with the United States.   There was no response. He has said no more on the subject.   That is the standstill into which Jesse Jackson now proposes tomove with a renewed humanitarian campaign for the release offoreign hostages in Lebanon. Fifteen are known to be held, nine ofthem Americans.   Jackson said they shouldn't be left out of mind because they areout of sight.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, has been held longer than any other hostage. He and Jacksonbecame acquainted when Anderson covered the release of Navy Lt.Robert O Goodman, a downed flier held for a month by the Syrians.Jackson went to Damascus to appeal for Goodman's release and toescort him home.   He said he would go back to the Middle East now to work for therelease of Anderson and the others if he had leads, contacts andindications such a mission would help.   First, he said, there should be a humanitarian appeal inmessages on radio, on television and in Lebanese newspaperadvertisements. He said he is looking for sponsors to finance thateffort.   ``In Lebanon, the captors are basically nameless and faceless,''he said in an interview at his Chicago headquarters. ``Thereforethe appeal has to be a broad-based appeal to religious andpolitical leaders and others who care.''   The black civil rights activist and two-time Democraticpresidential candidate said such appeals were making headway andmight have succeeded in 1985, but were undercut by theadministration's arms deals with Iran.   Two American hostages were freed during the arms dealings.   Jackson invited the interview on his projected renewal of publicappeals in Lebanon for release of the hostages. He said privateappeals can work. ``We should not interfere with the government inits efforts,'' Jackson said. ``But the government's efforts areboth modest and ineffective.''   He acknowledged that he doesn't know what efforts the newadministration is planning or making for the hostages.   Humanitarian appeals have been made before, and have failedbefore. Indeed, one of the men who made them, Terry Waite, envoy ofthe archbishop of Canterbury, was himself kidnapped on Jan. 20,1987, and remains hostage.   The captors, after all, are no humanitarians.   But Jackson said they cannot operate without the tacit support,or at least acquiescence, of the society around them.   ``We want to put the focus again back on the captured as well ason the basic agony of the captors,'' he said. ``We need to havethose holding the hostages know that Americans are concerned aboutthe rebuilding of Lebanon, about the children in the camps, aboutthe invasions and the bombings.   ``We are concerned about that. So was Terry.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R. Mears, vice president and columnist forThe Associated Press, has reported on Washington for more than 25years.</TEXT></DOC>
