Congress and the Bush administration are looking for waysto reduce taxpayer risk in deposit insurance, following themassive Sandamp;L bailout law passed last year. Such a proposalalso would inevitably restructure the banking industry. Thechanges are likely to break down the decades-long separationbetween commercial banking and investment and to allow newfreedom for banks to open branches across state lines. Mr.Seidman, however, didn't offer a specific legislativepackage.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time that a consensus is forming to limitfederal insurance coverage for wealthy depositors,multibillion dollar pension funds continue to benefit fromfull deposit insurance coverage. Under current FDIC policy,each beneficiary of the pension fund is protected up to the$100,000 maximum coverage.   &quot;The FDIC might be moving toward becoming the insurer forthe nation's pension programs,&quot; Mr. Seidman told the HouseBanking Committee yesterday, calling the trend &quot;notattractive.&quot;   Most of the pension funds held in banks are in instrumentscalled investment contracts, which have grown from a fewhundred million dollars in 1987 to nearly $10 billioncurrently, said a spokesman for Morley Capital ManagementInc. of Lake Oswego, Ore., which places the investmentcontracts in banks. &quot;Whether or not this could lead to anexodus {of the funds} from the banks, I can't say,&quot; he said.   The Bush administration is expected to unveil its ownstudy on deposit insurance before year end and is likely toinclude similar pension fund limitations, an administrationofficial said. &quot;Our notion is to try to return depositinsurance to its historical purpose, to protect smallsavers,&quot; he said.   Before the October recess, it's likely that Congress willpass a law permitting the FDIC to raise bank insurancepremiums above current caps in order to bolster the FDIC bankfund, which is at a record low. The Senate Banking Committeewill hear testimony today on the Senate legislation to raisethe insurance caps. The House already has passed its version.   Mr. Seidman said, however, that regulators haven't yetdecided whether to raise premiums, and he warned againstusing the FDIC fund as a tool to help balance the federalbudget. One recent budget proposal by Democrats hinged on $12billion in higher bank insurance premiums as an offset forother spending. &quot;I wouldn't count on us as part of the budgetprocess to increase {the premiums} to that rate,&quot; he said.   Aside from raising premiums, consensus is forming aroundother limitations on deposit insurance. House BankingCommittee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) lauded a billintroduced yesterday by Sen. Donald Riegle, (D., Mich.),chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Both chairmen wantto abandon the &quot;too-big-to-fail&quot; policy, in which alldepositors in large banks are protected during a failure --even those with deposits of more than $100,000. Mr. Seidmansaid the idea had &quot;certain appeal&quot; in reducing risk totaxpayers but could cause instability in banking markets.   He also joined Messrs. Gonzalez and Riegle in leaningtoward preserving the current $100,000 limit on depositinsurance, rather than scaling it back to a lower amount assome in the industry have urged. Such a move would hurt smallbanks disproportionately, he said, and limit their ability toattract funds.   Mr. Seidman also said that banks should be restructuredsooner rather than later, urging stronger supervision, highercapital requirements, and reduced bank investment risk. Hehas proposed that banks be permitted to engage in riskieractivities only in separately financed subsidiaries. &quot;We haveto decide what we are going to do and move ahead on it,&quot; hesaid.   Separately, the Resolution Trust Corp., the Sandamp;L cleanupagency, said the 247 thrifts it controls posted net losses of$2.6 billion in the second quarter, compared with $2.2billion in the first quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
