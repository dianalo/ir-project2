The president again extended the reporting deadline for athree-man emergency board, from yesterday until Jan. 15. InMay, Mr. Bush named the board to try to resolve health-carecosts, crew size and other contract issues, and laterextended its reporting date to yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   Under the Railway Labor Act, the newest extension put offfor another 30 days, beyond the Jan. 15 deadline, any strikeby the unions and any move by railroads to adopt their ownlabor-contract terms unilaterally.   The White House has said that a rail strike, besidesidling railroad workers and stranding riders, could causemore than 500,000 layoffs in the economy within two weeks.This winter, such changes would occur when the economy isalready likely sinking into a recession.   The emergency board finished its deliberations about aweek ago and began work on a report. Its recommendationswon't be binding, but Congress has typically acted to avertlong rail strikes in the past by enacting boardrecommendations into law. That last happened in 1982, whenCongress ended a four-day strike by the Brotherhood ofLocomotive Engineers.   This time, large railroads and 11 unions are far apart ona range of issues that they have been negotiating for morethan two years, and chances of a strike are considered high.That could be complicated if the U.S. becomes involved in awar in the Middle East, rail unions admit.   One of the biggest issues is health costs. Railroads wantworkers to start paying some of the premiums. And for thefirst time in 20 years, railroads are seeking to boost thedeductible amounts that employees must pay on claims.   The railroads also want to trim operating crew sizes to amaximum of two from a current three to five, or else reducewages of each crew member by 25% or more. Further, therailroads seek work-rule changes such as boosting the mileagethat crews travel for a day's pay to 160 miles from a current108 miles.   The unions oppose all these industry demands and insistthey can continue to resist them. The railroads aren't &quot;goingto impose something we don't want, because we can lick 'em inCongress,&quot; says Richard Kilroy, president of theTransportation Communication Union, which represents railwayclerks.   For their part, the unions seek wage increases of 30% overthree years, boosts in cost-of-living pay and job protectionin sales of short lines, among other demands.   Railroads say they need more cost cutting so they cancompete with trucks, and to improve their return oninvestment. Unions counter that they've given enoughconcessions in the past, and now need improvements.</TEXT></DOC>
