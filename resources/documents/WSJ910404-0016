The purchase will give Compaq access to Silicon Graphics'workstation technology and expertise in developinghigh-powered software that displays full-motion graphics inthree dimensions. These systems are widely used by scientistsand engineers to model processes on screen.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement between Compaq, based in Houston, andSilicon Graphics, based in Mountain View, Calif., is expectedto give Compaq a foothold in technical computers, eventuallyallowing it to compete in that market against SunMicrosystems Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and InternationalBusiness Machines Corp.   On Tuesday, Compaq is expected to announce that it willlead a group of about 20 companies in the building ofadvanced computer workstations using a technology known asreduced instruction set computing, or RISC, which makescomputers work faster. The alliance, including DigitalEquipment Corp., Microsoft Corp., Santa Cruz Operation Inc.and others, is expected to use RISC microprocessors from MIPSComputer Systems Inc. for the machines. Some softwaredeveloped for the machines, which will differ depending onthe company making them, also will run on today's personalcomputers, which use different microprocessors made by IntelCorp.   Compaq believes RISC will be crucial to more powerfulneeds of business computers in the future. As part of itsinvestment in Silicon Graphics, which currently buildsmachines using RISC technology, the two companies could makeand sell RISC computers together, Compaq said.   &quot;We've talked a lot about acquiring RISC technology andSilicon Graphics had what we needed,&quot; said Rod Canion, Compaqpresident and chief executive officer.   &quot;Compaq has scored a coup here,&quot; said Robert Herwick, ananalyst at Hambrecht andamp; Quist. &quot;They have found a pot oftechnology at the end of the rainbow.&quot;   Although Compaq wouldn't give details, industry insidersexpect the two companies first to develop a circuit board andsoftware giving Compaq's personal computers advanced graphicsfor use with engineering software. Silicon Graphics alreadylicenses key software technology to IBM, which uses it in itsRS/6000 RISC workstation.   Compaq is also expected to make use of Silicon Graphicstechnology to build more sophisticated versions of itsSystemPro, which acts as the hub of a network of personalcomputers. The SystemPro, which has been limited by itsPC-based software, would be more powerful if it ranRISC-based software, said Avery More, president of theDallas-based computer dealer CompuCom Systems.   The relationship also will benefit Silicon Graphics, whichhas faced difficulties trying to break out of its specializedmarkets. &quot;This gives us a chance to become a de factostandard for graphics,&quot; said James Clark, Silicon Graphicschairman.   It isn't clear, however, how the investment will helpSilicon Graphics' hardware sales. The company, for instance,will introduce this summer its first system prices under$10,000. But Compaq could steal its thunder by bringing outrelatively low-priced machines with leading-edge graphics.Mr. Clark said he believes the benefits of being consideredthe top graphics technology source will outweigh anypotential lost sales to Compaq.   As part of the investment, Compaq will purchase SiliconGraphics preferred stock convertible at $50 per share into2.7 million shares of Silicon Graphics common stock. Thepreferred stock will be redeemable by Silicon Graphics afterthree years and entitled to a 5% annual cumulative cashdividend, Compaq said. The company previously invested inpotential suppliers whose advanced technology could improveCompaq's product line.   In the past, Silicon Graphics has sought the help oflarger, better-funded concerns to fuel its growth. In 1988,the company sold a 20% stake to Control Data, which it laterbought back. Last year, it received a $35 million investmentfrom NKK Corp., a Japanese steel maker. Silicon Graphics isexpected to use the licensing fees to double its research anddevelopment budget over the next three years.</TEXT></DOC>
