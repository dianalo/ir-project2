Knoth said his office sold 32homes in July and 27 in August, about the same as a year ago. By contrast, inMarch, when the market briefly soared in post-gulf war celebration, the officesold 67 homes.;   &quot;It hasn't been dead, but it's been quiet,&quot; said OmarAndeel, an agent with Bishop Realty in Union City. &quot;It takes a lot morenegotiating between seller and buyer to close the deal.&quot;;   &quot;When real estatesuffers, everybody suffers -- the roofer, the appraiser, the termite people.It's slow for everybody,&quot; Andeel said.;   Ray Rybak of Realty World in Fremontdescribes a market in which &quot;There is no selling. The buyers want to steal theproperty and the sellers are saying, 'Hey, we aren't going any lower.' We'rehaving a hard time getting them together.&quot;;   Buyers are picky. &quot;In thismarket you really have to make sure of what you do, because every flaw ismagnified. Even the school districts are making a difference in price,&quot; hesaid.;   The low end of the market remains the most active. Entry-level condosand townhouses are selling, along with houses in the $200,000 range.;   Moreexpensive houses are sitting on the market for many months. Owners are findingthey have to slash prices to sell.;   It's a lesson that has not goneunnoticed at Canyon Creek Estates, a small development of new, expensivehouses in Niles Canyon. The collection of nine houses had several strikesagainst it when it went on the market last year. The timing was bad, thehouses were near busy railroad tracks and they formed an enclave of $600,000houses in a $200,000 neighborhood.;   Only one house was sold. Pacific WesternBank foreclosed on the development and took over the project. UnitedCalifornia Brokers was given the listing, and immediately slashed prices --which had already been cut -- even further.;   Houses that were originallylisted at $610,000 are now at $475,000. The result, according to agent ElaineCannata, is three sales contracts in two weeks.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAN STOBER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910930  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  462  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 30, 199100274168,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
