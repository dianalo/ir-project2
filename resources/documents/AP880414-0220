(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A suspected member of Japan's terroristRed Army charged with possessing three homemade bombs was turnedover Thursday to federal authorities trying to determine what heplanned to do with the explosives.   The 35-year-old suspect, who was identified by officials in hisnative Japan through fingerprints as Yu Kikumura, is listed by theJapanese Foreign Ministry as a suspected member of the left-wingRed Army.   U.S. officials said they had not yet established ties betweenKikumura and any group.   ``We have a lot of unanswered questions that we have toanswer,'' said John C. McGinley, agent in charge of the FBI officein Newark.   Kikumura was arrested Tuesday at a New Jersey Turnpike servicearea in Ridgefield after a state trooper found three bombs in hiscar, officials said.   Superior Court Judge Charles DeGisi released Kikimura to federalagents without setting bail Thursday. Kikimura was taken to a NewYork City jail to be held for a hearing Friday before a U.S.magistrate in Newark.   In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court by the FBI,authorities charged Kikumura with possessing a fraudulent visa andunregistered firearms. If convicted, he faces up to $260,000 infines and up to 15 years in prison.   State and federal officials heading a terrorist task force saidThursday they have little information about Kikumura and what heplanned to do with the bombs.   McGinley said Kikimura had not spoken to federal officials sincebeing taken into custody.   According to Japanese authorities, Kikumura was acquitted in aJapanese court in 1986 of charges of possessing dynamite in hisluggage at an airport in the Netherlands, which deported him.   The Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that Kikumura's arrestTuesday had raised suspicions the Red Army might be planningattacks during the summit of leaders of advanced industrial nationsJune 19 in Toronto, Canada.   The Red Army, which advocates ``simultaneous world revolution''and is believed to have members allied with pro-Palestinian groupsin Lebanon, has been linked to a bloody attack on Tel Aviv's LodAirport in 1972 that killed 26 people and the hijacking of a JapanAir Lines plane in 1977.   The group has been largely inactive in the 1980s, but SouthKorean officials have expressed concern it might revive itsterrorist activities at the Olympics in September.   State police Superintendent Col. Clinton Pagano said theterrorist task force decided to investigate because of thesophisticated nature of the bombs.   ``These are the first devices of this type that we have comeacross,'' Pagano said. Neither federal or state officials wouldelaborate.   According to the federal complaint, police said the bombsconsisted of three 18-inch steel cylinders. There was a total of 15pounds of black powder in the car, officials said.   U.S. Attorney Samuel Alito said authorities have learnedKikumura acquired an international driver's license in the name ofMasatoshi Kishizona on Jan. 20.   Kishizono is a 36-year-old employee of a hospital in Kyoto,Japan, who had reported his passport missing, police said.   On Feb. 29, Kikumura, using a fraudulent passport bearingKishizona's name, applied for a visa to the United States at theU.S. Embassy in Paris, Alito said. He said Kikumura entered theUnited States on March 8.</TEXT></DOC>
