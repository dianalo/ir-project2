We don't know exactly what's in &quot;Opening Arguments: AYoung Lawyer's First Case -- U.S. v. Oliver North,&quot; becauseMr. Toobin and his would-be publishers at Viking fearcriminal prosecution if they dare send anyone a copy. It'sunlikely that Mr. Toobin, a former writer for the liberal NewRepublic, criticizes Mr. Walsh's performance as strongly as,say, we would. What we do know is that Mr. Walsh'sso-far-successful prior restraint yields a fine sense ofbeing on the receiving end of an independent counsel's wrath.</LP><TEXT>   When Mr. Toobin, now 30 years old, left the independentcounsel's office in 1989, he agreed to have anything he wrotereviewed to make sure it divulged no confidential informationor violated the criminal prohibition against leaking grandjury information. The CIA and Justice Department both quicklyapproved the book, so it apparently contains no nationalsecurity or grand jury secrets.   Yet Mr. Walsh refuses to grant his permission to publish.The passages he finds objectionable remain under court seal.He asked that the Justice Department's Public IntegritySection bring a criminal case against Mr. Toobin, whichJustice refused. According to Mr. Toobin's court papers, Mr.Walsh even tried to get him fired from his new job as anassistant federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. The FBI startedasking Mr. Toobin's friends about him. Mr. Toobin finallydecided to sue his former boss, citing Mr. Walsh's&quot;stonewalling, specious objections and intimidation.&quot; Hehopes to get judicial approval of his right to publish at ahearing this week.   The First Amendment supposedly covered the threat of priorrestraint, though we do have some problems with prosecutorsdivulging information, especially against individuals whowere never indicted and so could not defend against anyaccusations. Mr. Walsh himself will write a report toCongress that almost certainly will smear unindictedofficials, perhaps even President Bush. For that matter, Mr.Toobin says that Mr. Walsh told him he planned to write hisown book on Iran-Contra. Any notion that prosecutors have aspecial obligation to keep silent out of court began todisappear with several books by Watergate prosecutors.   We doubt that any high principle is at stake here.Instead, we suspect Mr. Walsh simply fears the embarrassmentof disclosure. The Viking promotional material promises thatthe book will &quot;trace the complex legal and politicalstruggles&quot; of the prosecution, including &quot;within the officeitself.&quot; Last year, Mr. Toobin got a letter from Mr. Walsh'soffice objecting to references &quot;to matters which were and aretotally internal to the Office of Independent Counsel,including discussions of staff meetings.&quot; Sounds likefascinating reading. We wonder if anyone on the staff warnedof the legal problems with the prosecutions.   Mr. Walsh's conviction of Oliver North even on the minorcharges was overturned because he used evidence that Congresshad immunized. A similar fate awaits the John Poindexterconviction. Newspapers that once cheered on Mr. Walsh'scrusade now wish he'd just go away.   As we have said, this has been a political prosecutionfrom the beginning, which Mr. Walsh made worse bygrandstanding instead of following the law. While he waitsfor court permission to publish, Mr. Toobin should add achapter on this final lesson from the unsupervised andunaccountable prosecutor Walsh.</TEXT></DOC>
