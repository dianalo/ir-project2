(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rain-swollen rivers and creeks in Kentuckyand West Virginia surged over their banks, damaging homes,stranding children at a school and leaving roads covered with mudand logs today.   Miners in West Virginia rescued three employees of the companythey have been striking for 2{ months after a van carrying theworkers slid into a swollen creek, West Virginia State Police saidtoday.   Forecasters predicted more showers today in the region followinga storm from the remnants of Hurricane Jerry, which dumped up to ahalf-foot of rain.   Mike Callahan, National Weather Service hydrologist forKentucky, said the heavy rain was ``pretty much over with,'' thoughsome light rain may fall in the next couple of days.   ``I'm sure every small creek in southeastern Kentucky went outof its banks, way out of its banks,'' Callahan said.   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson ordered the state Division of Disasterand Emergency SErvices to help communities needing assistance.Authorities said Clay, Leslie and Pike counties requested help.   ``We are placing our personnel on the highest levels of alert,''said James H. Molloy, the agency's executive director. ``It looksas though the weather system will threaten again Thursday, so thisisn't over yet by any means.''   Dozens of families were evacuated Tuesday in Pike, Floyd, Clay,Letcher and Jackson counties. Hundreds of students were sent homeearly in both states, and classes in several communities werecanceled today.   More than 760 students and faculty at McDowell Elementary andHigh School were temporarily stranded at the school after theFrasure and Left Beaver creeks rapidly spilled over their banksTuesday morning; water 3 feet deep spilled into one of thebuildings.   School officials decided it was safer to keep students at theschool rather than attempt to run buses across the flooded creeks.But parents, angry with the decision, drove their cars and trucksacross the rain-swollen creek or waded in the waist-high water toretrieve their children.   By midmorning, the creeks began to recede and buses were takingchildren home where the roads were accessible, officials said.   The full extent of damage was unknown because high waterprevented emergency workers and survey crews from traveling to thehardest-hit areas.   Near Dehue, W.Va., three employees of Con-Serv Inc., a non-unioncompany operating a coal tipple for the A.T. Massey Coal Co., werein a van that slid 85 feet down a hillside into Rum Creek andflipped, and about 10 United Mine Workers on strike against Masseywent to their rescue, Trooper Ric Robinson.   One man was trapped in the van and pickets held his head aboverising water while waiting for emergency workers, said State PoliceSgt. G.A. Ables.   ``Without a doubt, had they not helped, he'd have died,'' Ablessaid. ``He could not have extricated himself from that vehiclehimself.''   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton ordered transportation crewsinto hard-hit areas around Matewan to help with the cleanup.   Steady showers early Tuesday flooded scores of southern WestVirginia streams, ranging from roadside ditches to the Tug Fork andGuyandotte rivers. The worst damage appeared to be in Matewan, atown of about 800 people in the southwestern part of the state.Officials said 150 homes there were evacuated, but residents wereallowed to return to their homes shortly before midnight.   Flood walls in Williamson and West Williamson protected thecities from damage. In Matewan, floodwaters inundated a servicestation.   ``It came up the quickest I've ever seen it,'' said DonaldDaugherty, a mail carrier from McCarr, Ky., across the river fromMatewan. ``There wasn't any warning at all.''   As the floodwaters flowed northward, a steady stream of garbageflowed toward the Ohio River. Floating milk jugs, bleach bottlesand tree limbs collected along the river's edge.   The Tug Fork crested at Matewan 6 feet above flood stage at 7p.m. Forecasters predicted the Tug would crest at Williamson earlytoday at 3 feet above flood stage.   Flood-swollen creeks prompted officials to send students homeearly on Tuesday in Raleigh, Fayette, McDowell and Logan counties,authorities said.   In Boone County, a house along the river was washed away by highwaters and later hit a bridge and disintegrated, state policespokesman Ric Robinson said. Pax Mayor Charlie Moore said PaintCreek flooded several homes in his southwestern West Virginia town.   In Kentucky, several homes in the Big Creek and Elk Creek areasuffered flood damage, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
