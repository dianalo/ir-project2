A number of states have also enacted rules governingfunds availability. The Act (Section 608) and Regulation CC (andSection;229.20) provide that any provision of state law in effect on or beforeSeptember 1, 1989, that provides for a shorter hold for a category of checksthan is provided under federal law will supersede the federal provision.Provisions of state law governing funds availability that permit a bankto make funds available for withdrawal in a longer period than permittedunder Regulation CC are considered inconsistent and are preempted by RegulationCC. In addition, state disclosure and notice requirements concerning fundsavailability related to accounts covered by Regulation CC are preemptedby the federal disclosure scheme.Regulation CC provides for Board determinations of whether state law relatedto the availability of funds is preempted by federal law upon the requestof a state, bank, or other interested party.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>The Board issued for public comment proposed preemption determinationswith respect to the laws of Illinois, Maine, and New York on June 22, 1988.53 FR 24315 (June 28, 1988). At that time, the Board also requested commenton the preemption of proposed amendments to the New York law. The Boardissued a final determination with respect to Illinois and New York lawon August 18, 1988. 53 FR 32354 (August 24, 1988). The Board deferred finalaction with respect to Maine law, at the request of the Maine AttorneyGeneral's Office, pending the adoption of a revised state regulation. Maineand New York subsequently adopted amendments to their funds availabilityregulations to conform the state laws more closely to the federal RegulationCC requirements. The revised regulations of both states became effectiveon September 1, 1988. The Board is now publishing final preemption determinationswith respect to the recently adopted laws of Maine and recently amendedNew York rules.On August 18, 1988, the Board issued for public comment proposed preemptiondeterminations with respect to the laws of California, Connecticut, Massachusetts,New Mexico, and Rhode Island. 53 FR 32359 (August 24, 1988). The Boardreceived 14 comments on the proposals, which are summarized below. TheBoard is now publishing final preemption determinations with respect tothe laws of these states.The Board set out principles, at the time it adopted several final statepreemption determinations in August, as guides for future preemption determinations.53 FR 32354 (August 24, 1988). Those principles have been followed in thesedeterminations as well.<T3>Notice of exception hold.</T3> The Board adopted in August a preemptionprinciple stating that the state exceptions continue to apply only in thosecases where the state schedule is shorter than or equal to the federalschedule, and then only up to the limit permitted by the Regulation CCschedule. The hold can then be further extended by the federal exceptionin accordance with Regulation CC. Only one exception notice is requiredwhere a bank applies a state exception to extend a shorter state scheduleto the federal limit, and also a federal exception to further extend thehold. This notice, which must be provided in accordance with andSection;229.13(g),need only include as the reason the exception was invoked the applicablefederal exception. <T3>Disclosures. </T3>Section 229.20(c) of Regulation CC provides thatstate law may be inconsistent with Regulation CC, and therefore may bepreempted, where it provides for disclosures or notices concerning fundsavailability relating to accounts. This rule avoids redundant disclosuresand variations in disclosures between states that may confuse bank customers.Some states, however, such as Maine and Massachusetts, require by statelaw that depository institutions in those states disclose their funds availabilitypolicies in accordance with the federal law. Such laws permit the stateto enforce disclosure requirements, but do not result in redundancy orvariations in disclosure requirements. Because such disclosures are notinconsistent with the disclosure requirements of Regulation CC, they arenot preempted by the federal law.<T3>California. </T3>California has different funds availability regulationsgoverning (1) commercial banks and branches and agencies of foreign banks,(2) savings and loan associations and savings banks, (3) credit unions,and (4) industrial loan companies. The California State Banking Departmentand the State of California Department of Savings and Loan requested, intheir comments, that the Board defer adoption of final preemption determinationswith respect to the regulations governing commercial banks, branches andagencies of foreign banks, savings and loan associations, and savings banks.The state Banking Department adopted emergency amendments to its fundsavailability regulations on October 18 to conform those regulations moreclosely to Regulation CC, while preserving some of the shorter holds containedin the current state regulations. The Department of Savings and Loan adoptedemergency regulations on October 7, deferring to the Regulation CC availabilityrequirements. These amendments become effective upon adoption, but aresubject to a subsequent public comment period. The state regulators anticipatethat the regulations will be adopted in final form in early 1989, and askedthat the Board issue final preemption determinations with respect to theseregulations at that time. The Board has deferred adoption of final preemptiondeterminations with respect to the regulations issued by the CaliforniaState Banking Department and the Department of Savings and Loan, pendingfinal adoption of their emergency amendments.The California Department of Corporations, which regulates credit unionsand industrial loan companies, has indicated to Board staff that the Boardshould not defer adoption of a final preemption determination with respectto the regulations governing credit unions. In addition, the Departmentof Corporations noted that it had promulgated separate regulations governingFDIC-insured industrial loan companies. Because these institutions arealso subject to the Regulation CC requirements, the Department of Corporationssuggested that the final preemption determination also address these regulations.Although a preemption determination with respect to the regulations governingindustrial loan companies was not issued for public comment, these regulationsare identical to those governing credit unions in all but a few details.The Board is publishing a final preemption determination under RegulationCC with respect to the California funds availability regulations applicableto credit unions and industrial loan companies.The state regulations applicable to California credit unions and industrialloan companies generally provide for longer availability than requiredunder Regulation CC, and are thus preempted by the federal regulation.The availability schedules applicable to certain in-state nonlocal checks,however, are shorter than the nonlocal temporary schedule in RegulationCC, and therefore supersede the federal law. In addition, the state regulationsupersedes the federal regulation to the extent that it provides for fewerconditions for next-day availability of certain check deposits.Under the Board's preemption standards, all state disclosure and noticerequirements concerning funds availability relating to accounts subjectto Regulation CC are preempted by the federal law. California law requiresan institution to provide a general disclosure of its availability policyto customers when the account is opened and provide a notice to the customerwhen a hold is placed on a particular deposit. A California consumer organizationcommented that the California requirement for individual hold notices shouldnot be preempted by Regulation CC, because the state requirement is notinconsistent with the federal disclosure scheme, and because the noticerequirement can be viewed as a condition to placing a hold on a depositand thus is an availability requirement in addition to a disclosure requirement.The Board does not believe that this particular notice requirement shouldbe treated differently from other state disclosure and notice requirements,and therefore the Board has preempted this requirement in California law.The State Banking Department, in a discussion with Board staff, agreedwith the Board's proposed determination, in which this requirement wouldbe preempted. The State Banking Department concurred with the view of Boardstaff that this notice requirement is separate from the availability requirementsand is not a condition precedent to the placing of a hold. The specificnotice is required by the same section of the statute (andSection; 866.2(b))that requires other disclosures to an institution's customers.\1\<NOTE/> There is thus no reason for the Board to depart from thegeneral rule that state disclosures that are different from federal disclosuresare preempted by the federal law.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ This commenter cites a law review article by a drafterof the California statute, Emma Jordan, <T3>Ending the Floating Check Game: The Policy Arguments for Delayed AvailabilityReform, </T3>36 Hast. L. J. 515 (1985), for the proposition that generaldisclosures and individual notice are two separate elements of California'slegislative solution to the delayed availability problem.

Const. andSection; 48.12 (4th ed. 1984).</ITAG><T3>Connecticut. </T3>Connecticut law provides availability schedules fordeposits of on us checks, in-state checks, and out-of-state checks. Thestate law also provides certain exceptions to those schedules. Generally,the state schedules and exceptions allow longer hold periods than the federalschedules and Regulation CC will preempt; however, out-of-state nonlocalchecks will continue to be governed by the shorter state schedule. Thestate schedules will also continue to apply to items such as nonnegotiableinstruments that are not covered by Regulation CC. In addition, the Connecticutlaw, including disclosure requirements, will continue to apply to accounts,such as savings and time accounts, not subject to Regulation CC. The Boardhas adopted the proposed Connecticut determination, with revisions addressinga commenter's question relating to the treatment of certain payable throughdrafts.<T3>Maine. </T3>On June 22, 1988, the Board published for public commenta proposed preemption determination under Regulation CC with respect tothe Maine funds availability law that was in effect at that time. The MaineAttorney General's office, in its comments to the Board, asked that theBoard not issue a final preemption determination based on the state's currentregulation, because the state was considering amendments to its regulation.The state anticipated that its revised regulation would be adopted in August1988, and would become effective on September 1, 1988. Consequently, theBoard deferred issuance of a preemption determination with respect to Mainelaw.Maine subsequently adopted a revised funds availability regulation thatrequires funds deposited to any deposit account to be made available forwithdrawal in accordance with the Act and Regulation CC. Funds availabilitypolicies for transaction accounts must be disclosed in accordance withRegulation CC. Funds availability policies for nontransaction accountsmust be disclosed in accordance with state law. The Board has determinedthat the revised Maine regulation is consistent with Regulation CC withrespect to accounts, and therefore the state law is not preempted by thefederal law and does not supersede the federal law.<T3>Massachusetts. </T3>Massachusetts enacted a law in July 1988, repealingits previous funds availability statute, and replacing it with a requirementthat institutions make funds available for withdrawal and disclose theirfunds availability policies, in accordance with the Act and RegulationCC. Massachusetts law provides, however, that all in-state checks are consideredto be local, even though the state is included in two check processingregions. The Board has determined that the state law generally incorporatesthe federal law, except that state law supersedes Regulation CC to theextent that in-state nonlocal checks must be made available for withdrawalin accordance with the local schedule in Regulation CC. Several technicalchanges were made to the proposed determination, including a revision reflectinga comment submitted by the Massachusetts Bankers Association, requestingthat the Board not infer in its determination that Massachusetts law governsterm deposits and interbank deposits.<T3>New Mexico. </T3>New Mexico's statute applies only to retail accountsand does not apply to certain instruments that are covered by RegulationCC; Regulation CC would therefore apply to accounts or instruments notcovered. New Mexico law, however, applies to time and savings accounts,and is not preempted with respect to these accounts. New Mexico providesdifferent availability schedules for checks payable by banks in the samemunicipality, for in-state checks, and for out-of-state checks. For certaincategories of checks, the state schedule supersedes the federal. New Mexicolaw provides for certain exceptions to its availability schedules; thesewill continue to apply where the state schedule is not preempted by RegulationCC, to the extent that the hold does not exceed the federal schedule forthat category of check. An applicable federal exception can be invokedto extend a hold beyond the federal schedule.No comments were received on the proposed New Mexico preemption determination.The Board has adopted the New Mexico determination as proposed, with editorialrevisions.<T3>New York. </T3>The Board published for public comment a proposed preemptiondetermination with respect to the New York funds availability law on June22, 1988. At that time, the Board also requested comment on the preemptionof proposed amendments to the New York law. Because the Board was not requestedto defer its final preemption determination pending the adoption of theproposed revision to New York law, it issued a final determination withrespect to New York law on August 18, 1988.New York recently adopted, in final form, amendments to its funds availabilityregulation. The amendments generally exclude accounts covered by RegulationCC from the scope of the state funds availability requirements. The revisedNew York law, however, continues to apply the state schedule for in-statenonlocal checks to deposits of these checks to accounts subject to RegulationCC. The amendment also provides that, with respect to time and savingsaccounts, New York institutions could continue to follow the New York availabilityand disclosure requirements, or could comply with those contained in RegulationCC. The Board has determined that New York law supersedes federal law tothe extent that it requires shorter availability for deposits of in-statenonlocal checks to accounts subject to Regulation CC.<T3>Rhode Island. </T3>Rhode Island law requires depository institutionsto make funds deposited by check in a personal transaction account availablefor withdrawal within certain specific periods. Different schedules applyto deposits in commercial banks and thrift institutions. The Rhode Islandstatute also provides exceptions to the schedules and requires institutionsto make certain disclosures to their customers. No portion of the RhodeIsland availability schedule supersedes the federal law, except to theextent that the state schedules apply to deposits at nonproprietary ATMs.No comments were received on the proposed Rhode Island preemption determination.The Board has adopted the Rhode Island preemption determination as proposed,with editorial revisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments</ITAG>The Board received 14 comments on the proposed preemption determinationsissued in August 1988. Twelve of the comments addressed the proposed preemptiondetermination for California. One comment addressed the proposal for Connecticut,and one addressed the proposal for Massachusetts. The Board received nocomments concerning the proposals for New Mexico and Rhode Island.<T3>California</T3>. Eight commenters, including the California State BankingDepartment and the California Department of Savings and Loan, requestedthat the Board defer its final preemption determination for California.These commenters reported that the state banking regulators are in theprocess of amending their funds availability regulations in light of RegulationCC, and that the amended regulations are expected to be issued in October1988.A California consumer organization requested that California's requirementfor individual hold notices not be preempted by Regulation CC. The commenterargued that the state notice requirement is not inconsistent with federallaw and that because the state notice requirement is ``more than a meredisclosure rule'' it should be allowed to stand in addition to federalnotice requirements.The commenter agreed that a state law that provides for funds availabilitywithin the same time as federal law should not be preempted. The commenteralso agreed that because California does not require special deposit slipsfor next-day availability of certain types of checks, the state law providesfaster availability for such checks and should supersede the federal law.Similarly, the commenter agreed that because California law does not providea one-day delay in availability for cash withdrawal purposes, the statelaw provides faster availability than does the federal law and should supersedethe federal law.Four commenters (two commercial banks and two trade associations) disagreedwith the proposed California preemption determination as it pertains tocertain requirements for next-day availability. The commenters opposedthe proposal's provision that California law supersedes Regulation CC tothe extent that it requires commercial banks to provide next-day availabilityfor cashier's checks that are not issued for remittance purposes, and tothe extent that it does not condition next-day availability on receiptat a staffed teller station or use of a special deposit slip. The commentersargued that because California Financial Code andSection; 867(a) containsthe staffed teller station and special deposit slip requirements for second-dayavailability for cashier's, certified, and teller's checks, those requirementswould also apply to next-day availability checks under the federal schedules,thus rendering the above provision unnecessary. One commenter suggestedthat the Board should specifically state that andSection; 867 is completelypreempted by federal law.The commenters also argued that Regulation CC's definition of ``cashier'scheck'' should supersede the state definition. Under this interpretation,there would not be a special category of cashier's checks (those that arenot issued for remittance purposes) that continue to be subject to statenext-day availability requirement.Three commenters made a similar argument for federal preemption of allthe requirements for next-day availability for state and local governmentchecks, even though California law contains no special deposit slip conditionfor such checks. The commenters argue that section 608(b) of the Act providesthat all inconsistent state law provisions, other than shorter availabilityschedules, will be preempted by federal law, and that the next-day availabilityconditions are covered by this provision of the Act.One commenter pointed out that Regulation CC's provision that certain checksmust be deposited to an account of a payee of the check to receive next-dayavailability supersedes the more stringent California provision that thenames of all payees must be on the account. The commenter argued that allfederal conditions for next-day availability should preempt state law toavoid undue confusion.One commercial bank made the general comment that state law should supersedefederal law only in cases where it provides shorter availability schedulesthan the federal law and that all other than inconsistencies discussedin the California preemption determination should be preempted by federallaw. Three commenters requested that California's new account and overdraftexceptions be preempted in their entirety.A credit union commented that all of the proposed preemption determinations,California's in particular, are too complex, and recommended that banksbe exempted from liability for inadvertent lack of compliance with stateor federal law.<T3>Connecticut</T3>. One Connecticut law firm commented on the proposedpreemption determination for Connecticut. The commenter pointed out thatConnecticut law defines ``item'' as ``any instrument for the payment ofmoney even though it is not negotiable.'' The commenter asked for clarificationas to whether the Board considers the state's definition to exclude payablethrough drafts payable by a nondepository institution.The commenter requested that when a state exception hold is placed on depositedfunds and consequently a federal exception is also invoked, a single noticeto the customer should be sufficient. The commenter noted that becauseConnecticut's reasonable cause exception could conceivably encompass allof the exceptions listed in andSection; 229.13 of Regulation CC, the reasonfor hold contained in the notice could be any of the federal exceptionsthat applied to the deposit.Finally, the commenter asked that, in cases where the Connecticut new accountexception is invoked, Regulation CC's definition of ``new account'' shouldapply, i.e., the state new account exception should apply during the first30 days the account is open rather than only to those items which are receivedfor deposit at the moment the account is opened. The commenter argues that,under the temporary schedule, banks should be able to use the federal newaccount exception for both local checks (which are subject to the federalavailability schedule) and nonlocal out-of-state checks (which are subjectto the state availability schedule).<T3>Massachusetts</T3>. One Massachusetts trade association commented onthe proposed determination for Massachusetts. The commenter forwarded anopinion letter from the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks that statedthat term deposit accounts are not considered ``accounts'' for the purposesof the state funds availability law. The commenter stated that interbankdeposits are also exempt from the state funds availability law.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 229</ITAG>Banks, Banking, Federal Reserve System.For the reasons set out in the preamble, 12 CFR Part 229 is amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 229_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

(CaliforniaFinancial Code section 886(b)) The federal preemption of state funds availabilitylaws only applies to ``accounts'' subject to Regulation CC, which generallyincludes transaction accounts. Thus, the California funds availabilityregulations continue to apply to deposits in savings and other accounts(such as accounts in which the account-holder is another bank) that areno ``accounts'' under Regulation CC. (Note, however, that under andSection;229.19(e)of Regulation CC, <T3>Holds on other funds, </T3>the federal availability schedules may applyto savings, time, and other accounts not defined as ``accounts'' underRegulation CC in certain circumstances.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The California law applies to any ``Item'' (California Financial CodeandSection;866.5 and California Commerical Code section 4213(4)(a)). TheCalifornia Commercial Code defines ``item'' to mean ``any instrument forthe payment of money even though it is not negotiable * * *'' (Cal. Com.Code section 4104(g)). This term is broader in scope than the definitionof ``check'' in the Act and Regulation CC. The Commissioner's regulations,however, define the term ``item'' to include checks, negotiable ordersof withdrawal, share drafts, warrants, and money orders. As limited bythe state regulations, the state law applies only to instruments that arealso ``checks'' as defined in andSection;229.2(k) of Regulation CC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Availability Schedules</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Temporary schedule. </T3>The California regulations provide that in-statenonlocal checks must be made available for withdrawal not later than thesixth business day following deposit.

Thus, the state scheduled for in-state nonlocal checkssupersede the federal schedule to the extent that they apply to an itempayable by a California institution that is defined as a nonlocal checkunder Regulation CC, and is not subject to reduced schedules under andSection;229.11(c)(2)and Appendix B-1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under the California regulations, credit unions and industrial loancompanies must provide next-day availability to first-indorsed items issuedby any federally-insured institution.

Thus, generally, the Regulation CC rule for availabilityof on us checks preempts the California regulations. To the extent, however,that an on us check is (1) drawn on an out-of-state branch of the depositarybank that is not in the same check processing region as the branch in whichit was deposited, or (2) deposited at an off-premises ATM or another facilityof the depositary bank that is not considered a branch under federal law,the state regulation supersedes the Regulation CC availability requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Exceptions to the availability schedules. </T3>California law providesexceptions to the state availability schedules for large deposits, newaccounts, repeated overdrafters, doubtful collectibility, foreign items,and emergency conditions. In all cases where the federal availability schedulepreempts the state schedule, only the federal exceptions will apply.

The Board interpretsthe definition of item to be consistent with the definition of ``check''in Regulation CC (andSection; 299.2(k)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Availability Schedules</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Temporary schedule.</T3> Rhode Island law requires availability forcertain checks in the same time as does Regulation CC. Thus, in these instances,the federal law does not preempt the state law. Rhode Island law requirescommercial banks (but not thrift institutions) to make checks payable bya depositary institution that uses the same in-state clearing facilityas the depositary bank available for withdrawal on the third business dayfollowing the day of the deposit. This is the same time period containedin Regulation CC for local checks payable by a bank that is a member ofthe same local clearinghouse as the depositary bank. (The Board views thedefinition of ``the same in-state clearing facility'' as having the samemeaning as the term ``the same check clearinghouse association'' in thefederal law's provision that allows banks to limit the customer's abilityto withdraw cash on the third business day if the local check being depositedis payable by a bank that is not a member of the same local clearinghouseas the depositary bank.) Since the Rhode Island law and the federal lawboth require the funds to be made available no later than the third businessday, the state law is not preempted by the federal law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Rhode Island law also requires commercial banks and savings institutionsto make checks payable by a depository institution located in the Firstor Second Federal Reserve District (outside of Rhode Island) availableon the seventh business day following deposit. To the extent that thisprovision applies to checks payable by institutions located outside theBoston check processing region, it provides for availability in the sametime as required for nonlocal checks under the temporary federal schedule,and thus is not preempted by the federal law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Rhode Island statute does not specify whether it applies to depositsof checks at nonproprietary ATMs. Under the temporary schedule in RegulationCC, deposits at nonproprietary ATMs must be made available for withdrawalat the opening of the seventh business day after deposit. To the extentthat the Rhode Island schedules provide for shorter availability for depositsat nonproprietary ATMs, they would supersede the temporary schedule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Exceptions to the availability schedules.</T3> The Rhode Island lawcontains exceptions for reason to doubt collectibility or ability of thedepositor to reimburse the depositary bank, for new accounts, for largechecks, and for foreign checks. In all cases where the federal availabilityschedule preempts the state schedule, only the federal exceptions willapply. For deposits that are covered by the state availability schedule,the state exceptions may be used to extend the state availability scheduleto meet the federal availability schedule. Once the deposit is held upto the federal availability schedule limit under a state exception, thedepositary bank may further extend the hold under any federal exceptionthat can be applied to the deposit. Thus, if the state and federal availabilityscheduels are the same for a particular deposit, both a state and a federalexception must be applicable to that deposit in order to extend the holdbeyond the schedule. Any time a depositary bank invokes an exception toextend a hold beyond the time periods otherwise permitted by law, it mustgive notice of the extended hold to its customer, in accordance with andSection;229.13(g) of Regulation CC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Business day/banking day.</T3> The Rhode Island statute defines ``businessday'' as excluding Saturday, Sunday and legal holidays. This definitionis preempted by the Regulation CC definitions of ``business day'' and ``bankingday''. Thus, for determining the permissible hold under the Rhode Islandschedules that supersede the Regulation CC schedule, deposits are consideredmade on the specified number of ``business days'' following the ``bankingday'' of deposit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Disclosures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Rhode Island statute requires written notice to depositors ofan institution's check hold policy and requires a notice on deposit slips.Regualtion CC preempts state disclosure requirements concerning funds availabilitythat relate to accounts that are inconsistent with the federal requirements.The state reuirements are different from, and therefore inconsistent with,the federal rules. (andSection; 229.20(c)(2)) Thus, Regulation CC preemptsthe Rhode Island disclosure requirements concerning funds availability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,October 25, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
