For a decade, the federal government has been shiftingresponsibility for spending programs from Washington to thestates. But now that the states themselves are financiallystrapped, they're looking to pass the programs -- but in manycases not pass the bucks -- on to the counties, cities andlocalities.</LP><TEXT>   The great experiment -- taking the principle of federalismand stretching it to its farthest point -- is being tried onits greatest scale here in California, where this summerRepublican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democratic legislativeleaders agreed to shift more than $2 billion in welfare,mental health and medical programs from the state to thecounties.   This dalliance with hand-me-down-federalism has greatimplications not only here but across the country, as alllevels of government seek to shift responsibilities in an erawhen money is as short as the public's patience with biggovernment programs. Smaller experiments in passing onprograms are now being conducted in Ohio, Illinois, New Yorkand Massachusetts.   &quot;This is the great sorting-out period for functions ofgovernment,&quot; says Steven Gold, director of the Center for theStudy of the States at the Rockefeller Institute ofGovernment in Albany, N.Y. &quot;There's going to be a lot more ofthis as we thoroughly rethink the functions of government.&quot;   And just as the states grumbled when Washington shiftedprograms to them, California's 58 counties already arecomplaining that Sacramento is dumping a huge burden on theirlaps just a year after the state reduced payments to countiesby $709 million for health, welfare, justice and generaladministrative costs.   On paper, the California shift doesn't increase thecounties' financial responsibilities. The compromise callsfor the counties to be reimbursed with sales-tax receipts andvehicle-license fees. &quot;There's a great willingness on thepart of Congress or state legislatures to send down theauthority but not the resources,&quot; says Gov. Wilson. &quot;We'resending both.&quot;   The problem is that hardly anyone believes that the taxand fee receipts are going to cover the welfare expenses --particularly during a recession in a state where, in the1980s, welfare caseloads increased at a rate three timesgreater than the national average and faster thanCalifornia's population grew.   &quot;The whole thing is a total fraud,&quot; complains DemocraticAssembly Speaker Willie Brown, one of the architects of thebudget compromise. &quot;There are inadequate resources, and theservices are going to have to be severely curtailed.&quot;   Sales-tax receipts are estimated to increase by about 8%-- about half as fast as health and welfare expenditures mayrise. Already, counties are reporting cutbacks and layoffs asthey gird for their new responsibilities.   &quot;Now we're 100% obligated for these programs, and we'llhave to dip into other funds to pay for these new health andwelfare costs,&quot; says Daniel Wall, legislative representativefor the County Supervisors Association of California. &quot;Itmeans deep trouble.&quot;   California's counties aren't alone in their woes. A NewYork State Association of Counties study this year showedthat state mandates now account for 60 cents out of everycounty-budget dollar. &quot;There's a real squeeze going on,&quot; saysEdwin Crawford, executive director of the group. &quot;We eitherhave to seriously cut the nonmandated services, reduce ourwork force or raise taxes, and usually we end up with acombination of all three. In any case, it's bad, and thepicture is growing steadily worse.&quot;   This year, Ohio restructured its general-assistanceprogram for people who don't qualify for Medicaid and regularwelfare, restricting the funding level and forcing countiesthat want to continue the programs to pick up the differencethemselves. In Illinois, aid to those who cannot affordmedical assistance is no longer being picked up by the stateand is being shifted to the local level.   Although the states in recent years have assumed somefunctions from localities -- New Jersey last year took overwelfare, mental health and youth programs, and several stateshave taken over court functions -- the momentum is clearly inthe other direction.   &quot;There's a real trickle-down going on,&quot; says ThomasSherman, deputy budget director for revenue in Ohio.   Last year, at least 14 states imposed new mandates onlocal government, mostly in employee-pension programs, healthand environment. Wisconsin's new recycling legislation putthe burden on municipalities, and Delaware forced itscounties to create land-protection programs. Kentucky andColorado required counties to develop water-supply plans,while Indiana and Utah required counties to preparesolid-waste-disposal plans.   These shifts often are cloaked in philosophicalexplanations, with governors and lawmakers arguing thatservices, particularly in the area of welfare, should bedelivered by the level of government that is closest to thepeople. But in most cases, the real rationale is money. TheNational Council of State Legislatures reports that three outof five states faced deficits during the past fiscal year,with state taxes going up by the largest margin in twodecades.   &quot;Money is really tight, and states are looking to cutwhere they can,&quot; says Marcia Howard, deputy director of theNational Association of State Budget Officials. &quot;It's nothard to understand how they end up cutting aid to localgovernment or shifting programs to them -- the way wecomplain that the federal government shifts things to us atthe state level.&quot;   The protests are moving down the line along with theprograms, however. &quot;We're at the bottom of the totem pole, sowe're getting everything dumped on us,&quot; says Frank Shafroth,director of policy and federal relations for the NationalLeague of Cities. &quot;The cities aren't prepared for it.&quot;   In Massachusetts, for example, state cutbacks in homelessprograms and rental subsidies mean the localities faceincreasing costs. &quot;It's much more of a financial burden on usat a time when we've also lost a lot of state aid,&quot; saysHoward Liebowitz, director of federal relations for Boston.As a result, local taxes are rising faster than state taxesacross the country.   Here in California, counties already are complaining thatthe services they have to provide will cost far more than thefunds they'll be receiving. &quot;One of these days, severalcounties are going to file for bankruptcy,&quot; says JeffreyChapman, an economist who directs the Sacramento Center ofthe University of Southern California.   Some California political analysts, however, welcome thechallenge and the discipline they hope it will impose. &quot;Theselocal officials are going to have to govern, and theLegislature has got to realize that it has relinquishedcontrol and it can't go in and interfere,&quot; says LaurenceMcCarthy, president of the California Taxpayers Association,a business-oriented tax group. &quot;Let's let this rest for awhile and see how local control can work in a vast, vaststate.&quot;   Many lawmakers in California and elsewhere believe moreprograms will be sent down to the local level. &quot;It's not a`feeding' chain because there's so little money,&quot; says DavidRoberti, powerful president pro tempore of the CaliforniaSenate. &quot;But it sure is a `starving' chain.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
