Law.&quot; Not only has Susan Dey decided toleave the show at the end of this season, but Harry Hamlin and Jimmy Smitshave yet to sign on for a sixth year of the series. We're told that Smitswants to concentrate on a big-screen career, but &quot;Law&quot; executive producerDavid E. Kelley says, &quot;To my understanding he still hasn't made up his mindwhat he'll do.&quot; Meanwhile, Kelley, who's been the top creative force on &quot;L.A.Law&quot; for the last two years, leaves after this season to develop a seriesunder his own banner for CBS. No one's been assigned to replace him yet -- andhis departure will be felt by the cast. Of course, some of that same cast feltabsolutely abandoned when producer Steven Bochco stepped away from activeinvolvement with the show in 1987 -- and &quot;Law&quot; has gotten along just finewithout him.;    BUSY BODY: Rae Dawn Chong reports the big-screen &quot;Starlight&quot;she was supposed to shoot in summer '89 with Kiefer Sutherland is back on theboards. But Sutherland is out and Willie Nelson is in, says the actress. Thefeature -- about an alien who arrives on Earth to impart vital knowledge to aspiritually receptive human -- is financed by Angelica Films, says Chong, andshe expects to start shooting in early summer.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  'L.A.
