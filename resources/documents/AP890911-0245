Bank President Barber Conable told a conference on theenvironment that the bank ``is committed to environmental issuesand, what is more, this commitment does not detract at all from ourprimary mission of global development.''   The American president of the leading institution for fundingThird World development spoke at the opening of a conference calledto address how to raise living standards in poor countries whilepreserving the environment.   Sponsored by the Japanese government and the United NationsEnvironment Program, the conference has drawn dozens of officialsand experts from many countries and international organizations.   At the end of the conference Wednesday they are expected to issuerecommendations on ways to combat the main problem on the agenda:global warming. Scientists warn that the so-called ``GreenhouseEffect'' could scorch parts of the Earth and raise sea levels unlesschecked.   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, whose country is underenvironmentalists' attack as the biggest importer of tropical forestproducts, pledged increased assistance to research on sustainabledevelopment of tropical forests.   Kaifu, welcoming the conferees, said Japan intends to raise itsforeign environmental aid to $2.25 billion in three years.   ``Japan is ready to take on global environmental issues withpositive vigor,'' he said, reporting that he discussed such issuesin depth during his just-completed series of summit meetings in theUnited States, Canada and Mexico.   Conable said the world's population, currently about 5 billion,will grow to 6 billion by the year 2000, adding to the use of fossilfuels that is blamed for the greenhouse effect and atmosphericwarming.   He announced that the bank is establishing a Gas Development Unitto promote use of natural gas because it is the least polluting offossil fuels.   ``I am also pleased to announce a tripling of our lending toforestry in the next few years,'' Conable said.   On population-control projects, he said lending has amounted toover $500 million in the last five years, and that level willincrease to over $800 million in the 1990-92 period.   Mostafa K. Tolba, executive director of the United NationsEnvironment Program, said depletion of the ozone layer, caused bychlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals, was increasing skin cancerand eye cataracts.   ``The human immunity system may be weakening. Agriculturalpatterns may be impacted, and marine food chains affected,'' he tolddelegates.   Tolba called for ``full partnership in all countries'' to phaseout all ozone-destroying chemicals and said he was concerned thatjust 13 of the world's 120 developing countries have ratified theMontreal protocol on those chemicals.   ``Brazil, China, India, the Republic of (South) Korea and someother major producers and users of chlorofluorocarbons in the ThirldWorld are yet to join the protocol,'' he said.   Regarding other ``greenhouse gases'' such as carbon dioxide,Tolba urged developed countries, which now emit three-fourths ofsuch gases, to decrease energy use and increase energy conservationand efficiency.   ``But we have to be quite objective,'' he went on. ``If theindustrialized world meets the challenge, the results of its effortscould be completely wiped out if China and India continue to burntheir huge reserves of coal. And they will continue to do so unlessthey are assisted financially and technologically to usealternatives.''</TEXT></DOC>
