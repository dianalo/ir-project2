BASIC is beckoning!&quot;andO;and start programming feverishly.andP;  So a product that would actually make mewant to lose sleep in order to program has got to be pretty intriguing.andP;  Thatproduct is Microsoft', Visual Basic&quot;.andM;The Visual Basic programming system is beyond intriging-it's addictive.andP;  Soaddictive that Eric and I spent hour after hour embellishing a sampleapplication for the Visual Basic article in this issue.andP;  You start up VisualBasic inside Windows.andP;  While you're developing your application, you neverleave Windows.andP;  You simply draw the user interface, double-click the objectsyou've drawn, and add functionality to them with code.andM;The program we wrote is a Windows slot machine.andP;  (We were sure that the onlything keeping those last few stragglers from adopting Windows was the lack ofa decent slot machine program.) Visual Basic made it easy to incorporate avariety of real Windows controls into our application.andP;  In Slotz!, icons arerandomly swapped onto the screen to look like spinning reels.andP;  Visual Basicis also fast; the first version of Slotz! swapped the icons so quickly thatwe had to add delay loops.andP;  Also, Visual Basic encourages you to thinkcreatively.andP;  Our first version of Slotz! looked almost nothing like the last.andO;It's so easy to add  just one more thing&quot; to an application, you could spendforever on it.andM;Virtually all the things that give me the willies about programming areeliminated in Visual Basic.andP;  (Please bear in mind that I'm not a 20-yearprogramming veteran.andP;  The first computer I used was a PC jr.) You don't haveto use 35 programs (an editor, a compiler, a linker, a make facility, adebugger, Spy, HeapWalk, the Icon Editor, the Dialog Editor, ad infinitum)just to create a simple application.andP;  You use a pull-down menu selection, notlines and lines of program code, to make the caption on a push button italic.andO;You don't have to type &quot;cl -c -Gsw -Od -W2 -Zdpi -AS app.c,&quot; you choose MakeEXE off the main menu.andP;  And unlike some other GUI development environmentsfor Windows, you don't have to learn some strange new programming language,you get to use a version of your old friend BASIC.andP;  What's not to love?andO;Plenty, some people are going to think.andP;  One of the things that irritates meabout some programmers is their attitude that, if it's not difficult enough,it's not worth doing.andP;  Too many programmers who've paid their dues learningto use C and the SDK are going to dismiss Visual Basic out of hand.andP;  If it'sreasonably easy to use, and if the language is BASIC, not C, they'll assumethat it can't create a powerful application.andM;Visual Basic does exhibit some constraints inherited from BASIC.andP;  You have toleave memory management more or less up to Visual Basic, which may make a lotof C programmers leery.andP;  Though the language's syntax is simple, as yourprogram grows in size, you may start to crave the terseness of C.andM;Although there is still quite a bit of windows functionality that only C andthe SDK can exploit, Visual Basic is going to transform Windows computing.andO;For one thing, there are going to be a lot more Windows applications outthere.andP;  For another, we less-than-world-class programmers are going to startcreating our own.andP;  So look out.andP;  Visual Basic is beckoning.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
