All have been standard elements of crisis-management operations in Washington in recent years. But they haven't been seen during the first test of President Bush's crisis-management team -- mostly because the team is a small, collegial and secretive group of old hands who have traveled down this road before.    That isn't to say the administration's handling of the crisis has been all smooth. The president and his aides initially created more of a crisis atmosphere than they intended, raising the danger they would be held captive by hostage-takers in the Middle East just as the Reagan and Carter administrations were. They then helped move so quickly from confrontation with the Lebanese Shiites holding American hostages to a game of diplomatic cat-and-mouse over a possible hostage release that they probably have lost any chance to make the murderers of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins pay for their crime.    But overall, the Bush team's performance has been characterized by &quot;collegialism, professionalism and problem-solving,&quot; says Kenneth Duberstein, chief of staff under President Reagan.    The team's most important operating feature has been the unusually extensive involvement of Mr. Bush himself in details of crisis management; he has shown that in a pinch he is more of a micromanager in the tradition of Jimmy Carter than a delegator like Ronald Reagan. And the most intriguing aspect of the crisis-management effort may be the emergence of two deputies, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gates, as important cogs in the administration's national-security machinery.    The Bush crisis team consists of Secretary of State James Baker, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Director of Central Intelligence William Webster, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. William Crowe, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, Mr. Gates and Mr. Eagleburger.    Few others in the administration have been involved in the most important discussions of diplomatic and military planning. Usually well-informed top aides have had to admit that they don't have first-hand knowledge of the most important administration deliberations.    It isn't surprising that the Bush team has turned out to be so harmonious; many of its members have worked side-by-side for years. President Bush and Messrs. Baker, Scowcroft and Cheney all served in the Ford administration; Messrs. Scowcroft and Cheney were working together in the Ford White House during a similar crisis, when the U.S. sent Marines to rescue the crew of a U.S. merchant ship seized by Cambodian communist forces. And the president, Mr. Baker and Adm. Crowe worked together through previous hostage crises in the Reagan years.    In the latest crisis, Mr. Bush set the tone from the outset. He was traveling to Chicago when the terrorists announced they had hanged Col. Higgins. Mr. Scowcroft, who normally travels with the president, and Mr. Baker were away on trips of their own.    Their back-ups, Messrs. Gates and Eagleburger, consulted by phone. When Mr. Gates informed the president in Chicago that Col. Higgins had been killed, Mr. Bush made two immediate decisions: to call Col. Higgins's wife and to return right away to Washington.    He demanded enormous amounts of information and began telephoning foreign leaders he had come to know in scores of overseas visits as vice president. Aides say he initially was given summaries of intelligence reports on the hostages -- particularly concerning the status of Joseph Cicippio, the other hostage threatened with death -- but then began demanding to see the raw cables on which the summaries were based.    The president and his national-secuity aides held regular meetings. To damp the crisis atmosphere aides realized they were creating, Mr. Bush held the sessions in the Cabinet Room, on the main floor of the White House overlooking the Rose Garden, rather than in the Situation Room, an austere and secretive room in the White House basement.    The crisis meetings have ended now that the hostage situation has slipped back into a cycle of diplomatic probing. But the prominent roles played by Messrs. Eagleburger and Gates have continued, administration aides say. In particular, Mr. Gates, a longtime intelligence officer, is emerging as a close confidant and &quot;alter ego&quot; of his boss, National Security Adviser Scowcroft, says one White House official. As if to underscore the point, Mr. Gates has just been promoted: He now has the title of assistant to the president, the top rank awarded to White House staffers. </TEXT></DOC>
