Background</ITAG>Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act, previously codified at sections1877 and 1909, provides criminal penalties for individuals or entitiesthat knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remunerationin order to induce business reimbursed under the Medicare or State healthcare programs. The offense is classified as a felony, and is punishableby fines of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 5 years. This provision is extremely broad. The types of remuneration covered specificallyinclude kickbacks, bribes, and rebates made directly or indirectly, overtlyor covertly, or in cash or in kind. In addition, prohibited conduct includesnot only remuneration intended to induce referrals of patients, but remunerationalso intended to induce the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arrangingfor any good, facility, service, or item paid by Medicare or State healthcare programs. The leading case regarding this statute illustrates its broad scope. In<T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Greber, </T3>760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir.), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>474 U.S. 988, 106 S.Ct. 396 (1985), the Third CircuitCourt of Appeals was asked to examine the nature of payments between amedical diagnostic company, providing holter monitor services, and physicians.The company billed Medicare for the monitoring service it performed, andforwarded 40 percent of those payments (up to $65 per patient) to the referringphysician. The defendant in this case alleged that these payments were merely ``interpretationfees'' paid to the referring physicians for their initial consultationand for explaining the test results to the patients. <T3>Id. </T3>at 70. The court, however, declined to examine whether theremight have been a legitimate purpose behind those payments, concluding:``if one purpose of the payment is to induce future referrals, the medicarestatute has been violated.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 69.Since the statute on its face is so broad, and the court has recognizedits full breadth, concern has arisen among a number of health care providersthat many relatively innocuous, or even beneficial, commercial arrangementsare technically covered by the statute and are, therefore, subject to criminalprosecution.Public Law 100-93Public Law 100-93, the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program ProtectionAct of 1987, added two new provisions addressing the anti-kickback statute.Section 2 specifically provided new authority to the Office of InspectorGeneral (OIG) to exclude a person or entity from participation in the Medicareand State health care programs if it is determined that the party is engagedin a prohibited remuneration scheme. This new sanction authority is intendedto provide an alternative civil remedy, short of criminal prosecution,that will be a more effective way of regulating abusive business practicesthan is the case under criminal law.In addition, section 14 of Pub.L. 100-93 requires the promulgation of regulationsspecifying those payment practices that will not be subject to criminalprosecution under section 1128B of the Act and that will not provide abasis for exclusion from the Medicare program or from the State healthcare programs under section 1128(b)(7). This section reflects the generallyaccepted view that the language proscribing remuneration that induces referralsis so broadly written as to encompass many harmless or efficient arrangementsas well.In accordance with the stipulation of Pub.L. 100-93, these proposed regulationshave been developed in consultation with the Department of Justice.Notice of IntentThe legislative history of section 14 of Pub.L. 100-93 indicates that Congressexpected the Department of Health and Human Services to consult with affectedprovider, practitioner, supplier and beneficiary representatives beforepromulgating regulations. In order to most effectively address issues relatedto this provision, we published a notice of intent to develop regulations(52 FR 38794, October 21, 1987) soliciting comments from interested partiesprior to developing proposed regulations. As a result of that notice, theOIG received a total of 137 timely comments, recommendations and suggestionson generic criteria that can be applied to particular types of businessarrangements in order to determine if such arrangements are inappropriatefor civil or criminal sanctions.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule</ITAG>We are proposing to amend 42 CFR Part 1001 by adding a new andSection; 1001.952to set forth those specific payment practices that would not be treatedas a criminal offense under section 1128B of the Act and would not serveas the basis for an exclusion from the Medicare and State health care programs.Before we discuss the various payment practices that we are proposing toexempt, we will clarify the effect of not having a particular businessarrangement exempted, and we invite public comments on the issues of continuingguidance, notice to beneficiaries, and preferred provider organizations.Business Arrangements Not ExemptWe are aware that it is the unique position physicians occupy in the medicalmarketplace that has led to the examination of their relationship withvarying business arrangements. It is the physician who controls accessto a large array of medical items and services in order for third partyreimbursement to be available. This is a highly competitive market thatis constantly expanding with new drugs, medical devices and tests. Whilethis competitive marketplace is important, it is necessary for the fiscalintegrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs to assure that physiciansexercise sound, objective medical judgment when controlling admittanceto this market. We have attempted in these proposed regulations to permitphysicians to freely engage in business practices and arrangements thatencourage competition, innovation and economy. However, we have added criteriato each ``safe harbor'' in order to reduce the potential for abuse.In order for a business arrangement to comply with one of the exemptionsset forth below, each provision of that exemption must be met. If, however,the business arrangement involves several payments, for example, rentalof both space and equipment, then each payment will be analyzed to determineif all the provisions of each applicable exemption have been fulfilled.Thus, fully complying with one exemption may not grant that individualor entity complete immunity under the statute.Several commenters responding to our notice of intent have asked that weclarify what it means if a particular business arrangement does not fullycomply with each element of a particular exemption. In many instances,the failure to comply fully with one of the exemptions will be of no consequencebecause the arrangement does not fall within the proscriptions of the statuteat all. However, where individuals and entities have entered into arrangementsthat are covered by the statute, where they have chosen not to fully complywith one of the exemptions proposed in these regulations, they would riskscrutiny by the OIG and may be subject to civil or criminal enforcementaction. Continuing GuidanceCongress intended that the regulations set forth on ``safe harbors'' bean evolving rule that would be periodically updated to reflect changingbusiness practices and technologies. In the House Committee Report accompanyingPub.L. 100-93, the Committee stated that it ``believes that a mechanismfor periodic public input is necessary to ensure that the regulations remainrelevant in light of changes in health care delivery and payment and toensure that published interpretations of the law are not impeding legitimateand beneficial activities. Accordingly, the Committee expects that theSecretary will formally reevaluate the anti-kickback regulations on a periodicbasis and, in doing so, will solicit public comments at the outset of thereview process.''We, therefore, invite public comments on how we can best achieve the twingoals of keeping the industry aware of our views of particular businesspractices, and assuring that our regulations remain current with new developments.Comments should address how affected parties can make their questions orviews known on a continuing or regular basis, and how the Department canbest respond to such concerns. Notice to Beneficiaries We considered including in several of the proposed ``safe harbors'' a requirementthat a person notify each Medicare beneficiary or Medicaid State healthcare program of the financial relationship that exists and any person towhom he or she refers the beneficiary for items or services. This requirementmay serve to provide an additional safeguard against the abuse for whichthere is always some potential when such financial relationships exist.Furthermore, it reiterates the ethical responsibility of physicians asreflected in the Current Opinions of the Council on Ethical and JudicialAffairs of the American Medical Association, and it is a duty imposed bysome State statutes as well. However, such notice requirements may be unduly burdensome compared withthe potential benefits to health care consumers. We therefore have notincluded the requirement in the ownership and financial relationship safeharbors at this time. However, we invite public comments on this issue.Preferred Provider Organizations We are aware that there are an increasing variety of arrangements amongproviders grouped under the generic headings ``preferred provider organizations''(PPOs) or ``managed care.'' Unlike HMOs, PPOs and managed care arrangementsdo not have a single unique identifying structure or concept. In addition,unlike HMOs, there is no single entity that is recognized as the ``provider.''For these reasons, there is no safe harbor specifically delineated forthese arrangements. Rather, we believe that the safe harbors we have designatedwould cover many relationships in preferred provider and managed care networks.Furthermore, the anti-kickback statute would not apply to participantsin PPOs where the discounts and financial relationships are obviously notdesigned to improperly induce referrals. However, we invite comments fromthe public regarding additional safe harbors that would provide furtherassurance to PPOs. Relationship to Other Laws The safe harbors being proposed in these regulations are only for purposesof the Federal Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute. They wouldnot provide immunity from civil or criminal prosecution or other sanctionsunder any other Federal or State laws. For example, a particular arrangementpermissible under a safe harbor may violate a law administered by the FederalTrade Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), or mayrun afoul of a State law that is applied by the State in a stricter fashionthan the Federal law. Proposed Safe Harbors Set forth below is a description of the various payment practices thatwe are proposing to exempt and the rationale for their inclusion in thisproposed rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Investment Interests </ITAG>As written, the anti-kickback provision applicable to the Medicare andState health care programs is so broad that it could be interpreted literally,for example, to prohibit a physician from receiving dividend payments froma large publicly traded pharmaceutical company if he or she prescribedone of the company's products for a Medicaid patient, knowing that orderingthat product would increase his or her dividend payment. We do not believe that Congress intended to bar all forms of investmentor ownership by referral sources in health providers. This conclusion isbased on the fact that there are other provisions of Medicare law thatpertain specifically to physician-owned home health agencies. Obviously,these provisions would make little sense if the kickback provision prohibited,<T3>per se</T3>, referrals by physicians to entities in which they hadany investment interest. To reflect this view that Congress did not intend to absolutely bar anyinvestment by physicians in other health care entities, we have includeda ``safe harbor'' for investment interests in large public corporations.We have done this to assure that the companies are sufficiently large enoughso that the return on investment is, at most, tangentially related to anyreferrals of items or services made by a shareholder, for example, theprescribing of a drug by an investing physician. This ``safe harbor'' describesa minimum number of shareholders and a minimun amount of assets the companymust have in order to qualify under this exempiton. We have adopted thesame bright line employed by the SEC. The SEC applies these same standardsto determine which companies are required to register with it, regardlessof whether they are traded on a national securities exchange (15 U.S.C.78<T3>l</T3>(g) and 17 CFR 240.12g-1). We believe this bright line will beuseful to health care providers as it sets forth a standard for permissibleinvestments under this ``safe harbor'' that can be easily determined. On the other hand, many commenters have described to us situations wherehealth care entities sell limited partnership interests at nominal costsolely to investors who are in a position to make referrals to the entity,and where the profit distribution in the first year, and each year thereafter,is substantially in excess of the original investment. Competitors of theseentities complain of losing a significant share of the market to an entitythat establishes a limited partnership with physicians in the service area.We have been urged not to include a ``safe harbor'' for such practices.Therefore, under the proposed rule, referrals by physicians to entitiesin which they have any kind of investment interest (other than in largecorporations available to the general public), such as limited partnerships,would be subject to prosecution under the same circumstances as they havebeen until now under section 1128B of the Social Security Act. However, we are considering crafting an additional exemption to the anti-kickbackstatute for certain limited partnerships and managing partnership intereststhat operate according to standards we would prescribe to assure minimumrisk of abuse. Accordingly, we are interested in receiving comments suggestingwhat those standards should be. This ``safe harbor'' might include: (1)Investment in an entity such as a limited partnership where a bona fideopportunity to invest is made on an equal basis to people in a positionto make referrals as well as others, where there are no requirements tomake referrals, where there has been disclosure to a referred patient,and where payments are not related to referrals; and (2) managing partnershipinterests where there is a disclosure to a referred patient, and wherepayments are not related to referrals. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Space Rental </ITAG>The anti-kickback statute is so broadly written that it could be interpretedto cover rental payments where one party is in a position to make referralsto the other party, even if there is no explicit or implicit understandingregarding referrals. While many rental arrangements are legitimate, wehave been informed of many situations where rental payments were simplya device used to mask the real nature of the payments, that is, to inducereferrals. Some examples of these kinds of arrangements are where: (1) A health careentity rents space at a rate above market value from a physician by thehour_with the space being used solely to provide care or services to patientsreferred by the physician_and the hours per week, and thus the payments,varying in direct relationship to the number of referrals; (2) a physicianrents space to a health care entity at a rate above what the market wouldordinarily bear, but the entity agrees to the high rent because of an understandingthat the physician will refer his or her patients to that entity; or (3)a physician rents space to a health care entity on a month-to-month lease,with the rent varying each month based on the number of referrals fromthe physician in the preceding month. These arrangements obviously fallwithin the scope of the anti-kickback law, and provide the potential toabuse the Medicare and State health care programs. Typically, the abusive arrangements involve rental payments either substantiallyin excess or below the fair market value of the rental space. The NinthCircuit Court of Appeals, in <T3>United States v. Lipkis, </T3>770 F.2d 1447 (9th Cir. 1985), emphasizedthe importance of determining fair market value when assessing the legitimacyof payments between parties who are in a position to make referrals. In<T3>Lipkis, </T3>a medical management company providing services to a physiciangroup entered into an arrangement with a laboratory where the laboratoryreturned 20 percent of its revenues obtained from the physician group'sreferrals back to the management company. The defendant alleged that thesepayments were fair compensation for ``specimen collection and handlingservices.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 1449. The court rejected this defense, concluding: ``Thefair market value of these services was substantially less than the [amountpaid], and there is no question that [the laboratory] was paying for referralsas well as the described services.'' <T3>Ibid. </T3>Accordingly, one fundamental principle is whether the paymentis based on fair market value, regardless of whether the payment is forspace rental, equipment rental, personal services, or management contracts.We have, therefore, crafted an exemption to the anti-kickback law in theseproposed regulations for rental arrangements that would require certainstandards and safeguards in order to limit the opportunity for abusiverelationships that are intended to induce referrals. Proposed andSection;1001.952(b), Rent, specifically would establish ``safe harbors'' in casesof rental agreements where: (1) In instances when access is for periodicintervals, those intervals are set in advance in the lease, rather thanallowed to vary week-to-week on the basis of the number of referred patientsto be served at the premises; (2) the lease is for at least one year soit cannot be readjusted every month based on the number of referrals; and(3) the charges reflect fair market value. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Equipment Rental </ITAG>Diagnostic and other items of medical equipment are sometimes rented ratherthan purchased. Obviously, there is no <T3>per se</T3> violation of the anti-kickback statute solely because theowner of the equipment refers a patient to the entity who is paying theindividual rent for the equipment. However, we have had situations broughtto our attention where payment for the use of the equipment, just likerent for space, is simply a vehicle to provide reimbursement for referrals.For example, we have had described to us arrangements where a providerrents equipment from a hospital and reimburses the hospital on an hourlybasis each time he or she uses the equipment. Under this type of arrangement,the hosptial knows it will be paid a fee by the provider each time it refersa patient to the provider for services requiring the use of the equipment.In another case, an ophthalmologist may rent diagnostic equipment to anoptometrist at a rate significantly below the usual market rate. In thisinstance, there is an understanding between the parties that the rate willbe adjusted periodically depending on the referral rate of patients fromthe optometrist to the ophthalmologist. The reduction in the rental charge,which becomes larger as the number of referrals increase, could obviouslybe construed as the offer of remuneration in order to induce referrals.We have, therefore, provided in andSection; 1001.952(c), a ``safe harbor''for equipment rentals similar to those applied to real estate rental discussedabove, along with the appropriate conditions and safeguards to limit thepotential for abuse. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Personal Services/Management Contracts </ITAG>Medical practitioners and providers often have agreements to perform servicesfor each other on a mutually beneficial basis.  Sometimes these agreements call for the party requiring the service topay a fixed amount or hourly rate to the party performing the service.In other instances, both parties may be allegedly contributing some serviceor benefit to a so-called ``joint venture,'' and taking compensation inthe form of a share of the profits generated by the venture. In still othersituations, a party may perform a service acting in the capacity of agentfor a company. For example, the agent may perform management services forthe company, or handle certain billing and collection services.  None of these arrangements is <T3>per se </T3> illegal solely because referrals between the parties,or to the joint venture, occur. However, if the nature of the agreementis such that payments are intended to induce referrals, or there is animplicit or explicit arrangement where the amount of the payment varieswith the volume of referral, the anti-kickback law would apply.  Examples of abusive arrangements that would fall into this category arewhere: (1) An orthopedist is under contract with a physical therapist toprovide billing services for patients he or she refers for the service,thereby receiving compensation in an amount that varies directly with thevolume of the referrals; (2) a hospital-employed respiratory therapistis paid by a supplier for servicing home oxygen equipment, but only incases where the therapist is the source of the patient referral; and (3)a hospital stores and delivers medical equipment to discharged patientson behalf of a supplier and is compensated through a disproportionate shareof the net profits of the supplier, although the hospital's only other``service'' to the joint venture is the referral of the discharged patients.The variations on these examples are virtually limitless.  We have established in andSection; 1001.952(d) a ``safe harbor'' for jointventures and other arrangements involving payments for personal servicesor management contracts, but only if certain standards are met and safeguardsare present to limit the opportunity to provide financial incentives inexchange for referrals. This exemption includes the determination of whetherservices are paid at fair market value, and is predicated on the same typeof standards and qualifications as set forth in the exemption for spaceand equipment rental. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Sale of Practice </ITAG>It has been brought to our attention that another approach sometimes employedby hospitals to assure a referral of business is to buy, or appear to buy,a physician's practice. Unlike the traditional sale of a practice by aretiring physician to another physician, in these cases the physician continuesto practice on the staff of the hospital. Thus, the hospital is able toassure that it will be the provider of both physician services and anyhospital services required by any of the physician's patients. The physician'spatients, in most cases, may be totally unaware that the physician has``sold'' his or her practice to the hospital. Further, such sales ofteninvolve much higher rates of compensation that would be the case if a retiringphysician sold a comparable practice to another physician. The additionalcompensation in these instances reflects the value of the referrals.  Another approach in the sale of a practice is for the hospital to pay apracticing physician a monthly fee to keep alive its so-called ``option''to purchase his or her practice. We have been advised that in these situationsneither party intends for the hospital to ever exercise its option, butthat the payments are for referrals and will continue only so long as thephysician meets his or her monthly quota of referrals.  We are also aware of practices between practitioners such as optometristsand ophthalmologists whereby the ophthalomologist ``buys'' the optometrist'spractice, but the optometrist keeps practicing, only now substantiallysalaried by the ophthalmologist. The only purpose of this sale was to lockup referrals.  The ``safe harbor'' we are proposing in andSection; 1001.952(f) would existfor the sale of physician practices when occurring as the result of retirementor some other event that removes the physician from the practice of medicineor from the service area in whch he or she was practicing, but not whenthe sale is for the purpose of obtaining an ongoing source of patient referrals.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Referral Services</ITAG>Professional societies and other consumer-oriented groups often operatereferral services, with a fee sometimes paid to cover the costs of sucha service. Because such a service fee could be construed as a payment inorder to obtain a referral, we have concluded that it is appropriate toestablish a specific ``safe harbor'' for this type of practice. The proposedregulations at andSection;1001.952(g), Referral services, provides standardsand safeguards to assure that the ``safe harbor'' is not abused by personswho would attempt to operate exclusive or selective referral services forwhich they would impose high participation fees.  <ITAG tagnum="81">G. Warranties </ITAG>We believe that it is in the public interest to have companies offer warrantiesas an inducement to the consumer to purchase a product. Section 1001.952(h)reflects this belief and provides a ``safe harbor'' for such purposes.We are aware, however, that some companies, such as some pacemaker manufacturers,offer so-called ``warranties'' on <T3>other </T3>manufacturers' products. The reason this occurs is thatthe Medicare program will reimburse the full costs of a replacement product.As a result, if a patient has no out-of-pocket expenses, he or she caneasily be persuaded to make use of another manufacturer's product, andthe manufacturer can, in turn, look to the Medicare program for reimbursement.These so-called warranties do not meet the Federal Trade Commission definitionof warranty, and these regulations would not provide a ``safe harbor''for such warranties. <ITAG tagnum="81">H. Waiver of Deductibles for Inpatient Hospital Care</ITAG>With the advent of the prospective payment system in 1984 for reimbursinghospitals for inpatient care, some hospitals have advertised the routinewaiver of Medicare coinsurance and deductible amounts as a means of attractingpatients to their facilities. Because the Federal anti-kickback statutedoes not distinguish between categories of individuals who are prohibitedfrom receiving something of value as an inducement to arrange for carefrom a particular provider, as a technical matter, the statute prohibitshospitals from engaging in this kind of practice.This discrepancy between the technical prohibition on waivers of deduciblesand the practices of some hospitals resulted in many comments. Commentersrequested policies ranging from complete prohibition to permitting widespreaduse of waivers.At this time, we have not included a ``safe harbor'' for waiving deductiblesfor inpatient hospital care in this proposed rule. However, we solicitcomments on defining a waiver of deductible ``safe harbor'' that wouldbe limited to inpatient hospital care, include only the deductible amount,be available to all Medicare beneficiaries without regard to diagnosisor length of stay, and assure that any costs to the hospital of waivingthe deductible would not be passed on to any Federal program as a bad debtor in any other way. With respect to other situations where deductiblesor copayments are routinely waived (such as Part B deductibles and copayments),we believe the anti-kickback statute is clearly violated.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Discounts, Employees and Group Purchasing Organizations</ITAG>The ``safe harbors'' relating to discounts, employees and group purchasingorganizations are specifically required under section 1128B of the Act.The proposed regulations, at andSection;1001.952(i), (j), and (k), respectively,set forth guidance on the scope of these exemptions.1. <T3>Discounts. </T3>The proposed discount exemption we are proposing isintended to meet the legislative intent of encouraging price competitionthat benefits the Medicare and Medicaid programs.The exemption applies to individuals and entities, including providers,who solicit or receive price reductions, and to individuals and entitieswho offer or pay them. However, while the exemption places certain requirementson individuals or entities who solicit or receive the discount, we arenot proposing any requirements on the individuals or entities offeringor paying it in order for them to qualify for the exemption. In addition,the exemption also applies regardless whether the discount is offered forbulk purchases, prompt payment or other purposes, and whether the buyerbuys directly from the seller or through a group purchasing organization.This proposed discount exemption closely follows the statutory language,limiting its application to reductions in the amount a seller charges ina specific transaction for a good or service to a buyer. We are specificallyrequiring that the discount be itemized and appear clearly on the invoiceor statement. This discount may take the form of a direct and explicitreduction in price, or of an indirect reduction that results from the offerof an extra quantity of the item purchased ``at no extra charge.'' Thisexemption specifically does not apply to remuneration in the form of otherthings of value, such as rebates of cash, other free goods or services,redeemable coupons, or credit towards the future purchases of other goodsor services. It also does not apply to any reductions in price offeredto beneficiaries, such as routine reductions or waiver of coinsurance anddeductible amounts owed by program beneficiaries, unless permitted underthese regulations for inpatient hospital care.We have proposed to limit the scope of this exemption because we have becomeaware of numerous practices whereby practitioners and providers have beenoffered a variety of things of value, which are not legitimate ``discounts,''in return for referrals of Medicare or State health care program business.Such forms of remuneration include, among other things, trips, computersor computer terminals, coupons, cash rebates, or in kind offers, such asthe inclusion of one free item when one hundred are purchased. We believethat these practices should not qualify for the discount exemption becausemany of them are subject to abuse and because their benefits cannot berealized by the Medicare and Medicaid programs.In addition, we believe that it would not be feasible to enforce the requirementsof the exemption if remuneration other than price discounts were permittedhere. Such an enforcement effort would require the Department to know theprecise amount and value of these other goods or services and then be ableto apportion that value to each claim or request for payment. It wouldbe very easy for providers seeking to evade enforcement to conceal or undervaluesome part of these goods or services. However, we are interested in receivingcomments on the prevalence of such arrangements and mechanisms that couldbe used to recognize other cash or inkind discounts where the benefitscan be realized by the Medicare and Medicaid programs.For the purposes of qualifying for this discount exemption, we have dividedproviders, practitioners, and suppliers into three categories, dependingon how they are reimbused under the programs: (1) Payments based on reasonablecost, acquisition cost, and prospectively determined payment amounts, suchPPS payments to hospitals, the composite rate paid to providers of maintenancerenal dialysis services, or payments made <T3>exclusively </T3>on a fee schedule; (2) payments based in whole orin part on charges; and (3) payments based on a capitated risk sharingbasis under section 1876 of the Act or on a similar basis.With respect to the first category, cost-based or PPS paid providers, theexemption merely requires the individual or entity to report the discount.Of course, we expect that the <T3>full </T3>amount of the discount to be reported. For the most part,this would be accomplished through the cost report. For example, the reasonable cost rules at 42 CFR 413.98 specify how toreport discounts. In other cases, such as with payments based on acquisitioncosts, the discount could alternatively be reported on the claim or requestfor payment.With respect to the second category, those paid in whole or in part onthe basis of charges, the exemption applies only if the discount is reported,and the actual charge is reduced by <T3>the full amount </T3>of the discount.This second discount exemption applies to all individuals or entities thatare reimbursed based on the lesser of actual charges or fee schedule amounts.We are aware of many situations, particularly in the case of laboratory-to-laboratorydiscounts offered by one clinical diagnostic laboratory to another, wherefee schedule amounts are being paid by Medicare but if the discount wereproperly reported and fully reflected, the actual charge would be reducedto below the fee schedule amount.With respect to the third category, we are proposing not to impose anyrequirements or risk sharing health maintenance organizations or competitivemedical plans paid on a capitated basis under section 1876 of the Act oron a similar basis. Since we do not perceive any circumstance where theMedicare or State health care programs will benefit from any price reductionsobtained by these entities, we see no purpose in imposing any requirementson them to comply with this exemption.<T3>2. Employees. </T3>This statutory exemption permits an employer to pay an employee in whatevermanner he or she chooses for having that employee assist in the solicitationof Medicare or State health care program business. The proposed exemptionfollows the statute in that it applies only to bona fide employee-employerrelationships. We have decided to adopt the definition of employee fromthe Internal Revenue Service set forth in 26 U.S.C. 3121(d)(2).In response to the October 21, 1987 request for comments, many commenterssuggested that we broaden the exemption to apply to independent contractorspaid on a commission basis. We have declined to adopt this approach becausewe are aware of many examples of abusive practices by sales personnel whoare paid as independent contractors and who are not under appropriate supervision.We believe that if individuals and entities desire to pay a salespersonon the basis of the amount of business they generate, then to be exemptfrom civil or criminal prosecution, they should make these salespersonsemployees where they can and should exert appropriate supervision for theindividual's acts.<T3>3. Group purchasing organizations.</T3>This exemption applies to payments made by a vendor of goods or servicesto a person authorized to act as a group purchasing organization (GPO)for a number of individuals or entities who are furnishing Medicare orState health care program services. The exemption closely follows the statute,and requires a written agreement between the GPO and the individual orentity that specifies the amount the GPO will be paid. Where the entityis a provider, the exemption requires the GPO to disclose in writing tothe provider at least annually the amounts received from each vendor withrespect to purchases made on behalf of that provider. Providers must makesuch disclosures available to the Department upon request, but we are notproposing at this time to require that these disclosures be submitted ona routine basis. In addition, we are not proposing more specific requirementsas to the content of the disclosure. At this time, we have concluded thatthe purposes of this statutory exemption are fulfilled with these limiteddisclosure requirements. Of course, providers and GPOs remain free to supplementthese requirements as they see fit.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>A. IntroductionExecutive Order 12291 requires us to prepare and publish an initial regulatoryimpact analysis for any proposed regulation that meets one of the ExecutiveOrder criteria for a ``major rule,'' that is, that would be likely to resultin (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individuals, industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies or geographic regions; or, (3) significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. In addition, we generally preparea regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 6712), unless the Secretary certifiesthat a proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.B. Impact on Providers and PractitionersThe provision providing new authority to the OIG to exclude a person orentity from Medicare and State health care programs if engaged in a prohibitedremuneration scheme would ensure that the Department could seek actionagainst those practicing in such prohibited schemes short of criminal prosecution.This provision, is a result of the statute and not this proposed rule.In addition, this proposed rule attempts to specify various business andpayment practices that would not be considered a kickback for purposesof criminal or civil remedies. The regulations serve to clarify departmentalpolicy as to the legality of various commercial arrangements. We believethat the great majority of providers and practitioners do not engage inillegal remuneration schemes, and that the aggregate economic impact ofthis provision should, in effect, be minimal, affecting only those whohave chosen to interpret the kickback statute broadly and who have engagedin prohibited payment schemes in violation of the statutory intent.C. ConclusionFor these reasons, we have determined that a regulatory impact analysisis not required. Further we have determined, and the Secretary certifies,that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact ona number of small business entities. Therefore, we have not prepared aregulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Section 1001.952 of this proposed rule contains information collectionrequirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.3504), we have submitted a copy of this proposed rule to the ExecutiveOffice of Management and Budget (EOMB) for its review of these requirements.Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on theinformation collection requirements should follow the instructions in theADDRESS section of this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
