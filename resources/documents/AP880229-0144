The National Association of Business Economists said its latestmember survey found economists in a more upbeat mood than threemonths ago when more than half of them said the record fall instock prices on Oct. 19 would lead to a recession in 1988.   In the latest survey, the number forecasting a recession thisyear had dropped to one-fourth, good news for Republicans hoping tohold onto the White House. But an overwhelming 83 percent of theanlysts said a downturn was very likely before the end of the nextpresident's first year in office.   ``Back in November there was a great deal of nervousness aboutwhat Oct. 19 meant to the economy,'' said Kathleen Cooper, whobriefed reporters on the new forecast. ``Since that time, we havehad good Christmas sales, good employment growth and consumerconfidence surveys have improved. These things make economists feelbetter about the future.''   While the next president will likely have to deal with arecession early in his first term, the economists said theyexpected the economy this year to expand at a modest pace of 2percent, as measured by the gross national product.   This would be about half of the 3.9 percent GNP growth turned induring 1987. The Reagan administration, by contrast, is moreoptimistically forecasting 2.4 percent GNP growth this year, whenmeasured from the fourth quarter of 1987.   ``Even though most of us don't expect a recession, we will havemuch slower growth than in 1987,'' said Ms. Cooper, who is chiefeconomist for Security Pacific National Bank of Los Angeles. Shesaid the stock market decline had caused many economists to slashtheir GNP forecasts by between 0.5 percent and 1 percent.   In other predictions, the survey results from 200 economistsfound:   _ Unemployment will creep up this year because of the sluggishgrowth forecasts, rising from the current 5.8 percent level to 6.1percent by the end of the year.   _ Inflation will remain under control with consumer pricesrising 4.2 percent this year, a bit slower than the 4.4 percentconsumer inflation recorded in 1987.   _ The federal budget deficit will rise to $157 billion in thecurrent fiscal year, but then resume falling, droping to $140billion by 1990. This is more pessimistic than the Reaganadministration, which puts this year's deficit at $146.7 billion, afurther improvement from the $150.4 billion 1987 deficit.   _ The foreign trade deficit, which hit a record $171 billionlast year, will finally start coming down, dipping to $150 billionthis year and $130 billion in 1989. Half of this year's overallgrowth will come from improvements in the trade deficit, theeconomists said.   _ Interest rates will hold steady, ending up the year aboutwhere they are currently. Banks cut their prime rate, used to setinterest rates on a variety of corporate and consumer loans, to 8.5percent in early February and analysts forecast this would be therate in effect at year's end.   Ms. Cooper said that the optimistic outlook for interest ratesstemmed in part from a belief that the Federal Reserve would beeasing its grip on the money supply in the first half of the yearin an effort to keep the recovery alive.   She said over two-thirds of the economists believed the Fedwould be easing credit conditions in the coming six months withone-fourth of the analysts looking for a cut in the discount rate,the interest the Fed charges to make bank loans.   Ms. Cooper said that the economists believe that the dollar,which has at time fallen sharply on foreign currency exchanges,will stabilize this year with only one-fifth of the analystsexpecting a decline of 10 percent or more. Just three months ago,more than 40 percent of the economists were forecasting a declinein the dollar that was at least that large.</TEXT></DOC>
