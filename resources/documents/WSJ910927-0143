Butthey still face an uphill task convincing investors thatthey're a safe haven for funds.   Therein lies a challenge not just for Eastern Europe butalso for bankers and regulators in the West. In a debatelikely to prove controversial, some bankers even proposerelaxing regulatory requirements that at present effectivelybar major institutional investors from lending a hand.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The key to future stability in these countries is theirability to access new funds,&quot; says Hans-Joergen Rudloff,chairman and chief executive officer of Credit Suisse FirstBoston Ltd. Without the finance to cover their enormouscapital needs, he warns, &quot;the economic outlook in thesecountries will be so miserable that you'll face a massmigration of people.&quot;   For Western Europe, the consequences of political andsocial instability in Eastern Europe could be dire.Yugoslavia is already torn by civil conflict, Czechoslovakiafaces the threat of ethnic strife, and crowds of Poles andRomanians are heading west in search of jobs and betterliving conditions -- with more likely to leave if conditionsat home fail to improve.   For the moment, however, affordable funding for EasternEurope is scarce, in Western Europe or elsewhere. Somefunding is being provided by international institutions suchas the World Bank and the newly created European Bank forReconstruction and Development, which Wednesday launched itsfirst bond issue, for 500 million European currency units,($611.3 million) to help finance the restructuring of theformer East Bloc nations' economies. Some is coming fromtrade finance and some is coming from commercial investment.But more will be needed in the form of straight publicborrowing. And in the wake of successive debt crises, themarket for syndicated bank loans is practically closed toEastern European governments.   That effectively leaves bonds, sold to institutional andprivate investors, as one of the few alternative sources offinance. Hungary has already launched issues in severalcurrencies, and Czechoslovakia is expected to follow soon.   &quot;Basically, their financing needs are unlimited,&quot; says aU.S. banker in London. &quot;They have to use the bond marketsbecause the commercial lending markets are dry.&quot;   At Credit Suisse, Mr. Rudloff has had experience with thedifficulty of placing East European bonds. Recently, CreditSuisse, based in Zurich, led a five-year bond issue of 200million ECU's at 12% for National Bank of Hungary, for whichthe signing took place in London this week.   To sell the bonds, Credit Suisse organized a syndicate ofnine international banks as co-lead managers guaranteeing theissue and 25 others as co-managers responsible for placingthe bonds. Whether because of the fees offered or out of asense of solidarity with Eastern Europe, more banks showed areadiness to participate than Mr. Rudloff says he hadexpected.   Even so, he admits, the operation wasn't a completesuccess. After two days of public trading, Credit Suisse,which had pledged to ensure a liquid market, found itselfwith around 20% of the bonds back on its books. Though demandhas since picked up, the overhang is still around 10%.   On the basis of a launch price of 98 3/4, the bonds paidinvestors a yield of 12.35%, putting the cost of borrowing inECUs for Hungary at around three percentage points more thanfor top West European governments. The market, says Mr.Rudloff, &quot;is comparing them with a high-risk privatecompany.&quot;   The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, orEBRD, based in London, and created by Western nations tofoster Eastern European environmental, private sector andmarket reforms, launched a five-year bond Wednesday, whichbore a coupon of 8.75% and was priced to yield 8.92%,reflecting the bank's triple-A credit rating. Instead ofinvesting the funds it raises in bond issues by nationalgovernments in Eastern Europe, which might be one way ofreducing the cost of their borrowing, the EBRD intends to usethe cash to finance specific projects under its supervision.While that may be prudent from a banking point of view,however, it doesn't solve the question of how governments inEastern Europe are going to fund their general spendingneeds.   Given the potential for political instability in theregion, many analysts consider a cautious view of itsprospects to be justified. In the case of Hungary, the onlyformer Soviet bloc state to enjoy a credit rating at all,&quot;the risk of default here is somewhat higher than it would beon an investment-grade bond,&quot; says David Levey of Moody'sInvestors Service Inc. in New York. &quot;There's a high level ofdebt and a difficult transition period to be undergone.&quot;   For the moment in Hungary, a U.S. banker says, &quot;Everybodyyou talk to is unequivocal: `We will honor the debt.' Butwhat happens two or three years down the line, when thecrunch comes with high unemployment and lots of demands onthe state's reserves?&quot;   In July 1990, a few months after the fall of the BerlinWall and the resulting wave of change in Eastern Europe,Moody's downgraded Hungary's credit rating from Baa-2 -- itslowest investment-grade bond rating -- to Ba-1, just belowinvestment-grade category. That means many pension funds andcorporate investors aren't able to buy Hungary's bonds,because of regulatory restrictions or limitations built intotheir statutes concerning the quality of the securities theymust invest in.   &quot;You have got to cut through the euphoria of Communismcollapsing and look at the real risks involved,&quot; commentsRobert K. Siegel, managing director of U.S. brokerageOppenheimer andamp; Co. Inc.'s London office. The former Sovietbloc countries, he affirms, haven't yet got theinfrastructure needed to get their economies up and running.&quot;A better risk is Latin America, where they have theinfrastructure and a more recent capitalist tradition,&quot; heasserts.   Mr. Rudloff's response is to affirm that, given the marketsanctions that would result, default by an East Europeangovernment on a bond issue is most unlikely. In recenthistory, he says, practically the only government bonddefault was by Costa Rica in 1982. &quot;Default on a bond issueis the virtual end of private sector investment,&quot; he says.   To help provide cash for Eastern Europe, he suggests,regulators should allow institutions to allocate a smallproportion of their funds, perhaps 3% to 5%, to high-yieldingEast European bonds. &quot;If you look at Europe, the classicinvestors that we're dealing with have around $50 billion to$75 billion in institutional funds,&quot; he says, and such a move&quot;would free up hundreds of millions if not billions ofdollars for investment.&quot;   On the downside, he maintains, the risks would be limited.&quot;If you accept that Hungary is not going to default, thenyields over five years of over 12% are a very interestingproposition,&quot; he says. Funds devoted exclusively tohigh-yield, high-risk bonds would be an alternatepossibility, he says, but &quot;as a Swiss, I prefer to have 3% or4% or 5% of East European bonds in a general fund, becausethough I increase the yield, the risk is limited.&quot;   At the moment, there's no clear solution in sight. Inspite of the high yields, few bankers share Mr. Rudloff'ssanguine view of East European bonds. &quot;The risk profile isjust too high,&quot; says Jim Cooper, an executive in charge ofprivate banking at Lloyds Bank PLC.   At Britain's Securities and Investment Board, which hasresponsibility for regulating the U.K. financial-servicesindustry, an official says its criteria forinstitutional-investment practices are based on &quot;financialprudence, with no political bias.&quot;   Given the choice between already high-yielding bondsissued by an Italian state agency, say, or a U.K. watercompany and bonds issued by an East European borrower, Mr.Cooper says, there's no commercial reason to go for thehigher-risk option. Financial institutions, he says, &quot;have tobe much more cautious this time around&quot; than they were withthe &quot;black hole&quot; of Latin American and East European debt inthe 1980s.   The ultimate question is whether such caveats areapplicable in the new situation posed by Eastern Europe. &quot;Noone would suggest building a new Iron Curtain to stem theflow of immigration from these countries,&quot; Mr. Rudloff says.&quot;With the frontiers open as they are now, we cannot have anappallingly poor Europe and a rich one next door.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
