A Solidarity spokesman said the walkout at the July Manifestomine, where the nationwide strike wave began more than two weeksago, appeared to be nearing an end.   But by Thursday night, Walesa failed to convince striking busand dock workers in the Baltic port of Szczecin to end theirstrike, and the strike committee decided to press for settlement oftheir local issues, said the spokesman, Arkadiusz Rybicki.   Walesa met with ranking officials Wednesday for the first timein six years and the government agreed to discuss the outlawedunion and other issues. Restoring Solidarity's legal status was themain demand of the strikers.   Workers at the Stalowa Wola steel mill in southern Poland beganleaving the plant at 7 p.m. after receiving a telephone appeal fromWalesa and a message from the Roman Catholic episcopate, a strikecommittee spokeswoman said.   At least 3,000 strikers were in the Lenin shipyard, where Walesaworks as an electrician, including workers from other yards in thisBaltic port. They hoisted Solidarity banners as members of theirstrike committee led them out.   About 2,000 onlookers chanted, ``Thank you, thank you!'' and``There is no freedom without Solidarity!'' Strikers and the crowdoutside joined in singing the national anthem just before theshipyard gates swung open.   More people lined the route to St. Brygida's Church, aheadquarters of sorts for the men of the shipyard where Walesa leda strike eight years ago that gave birth to Solidarity.   Poland's communist authorities recognized Solidarity in anagreement signed Aug. 31, 1980, but declared martial law inDecember 1981 to suppress the first independent union in the Sovietbloc and outlawed it the following year.   In the packed church, the Rev. Henryk Jankowski declared:   ``In your wisdom which you showed today you decided aboutsuspending the protest, but it is only the end of the physicalprotest. The strike goes on through dialogue.''   Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski conducted the Mass, and said at itsoutset: ``I thank you for your wisdom, you sons of a 1,000-year-oldnation which has always been connected with the church.''   Shipyard workers gave up their strike in response to an appealby Walesa, who said an end to the labor turmoil would will open theway for talks the government promised. The strikes began Aug. 16and at their height idled 20 sites employing 100,000 people.   One group of Gdansk port workers complained of bad faith byauthorities. They said they were told not to return to their jobsbecause they had been fired for striking, said Antoni Graberczyk, amember of the Gdansk port strike committee.   He said the men would rally outside the port Friday to protestthe action.   A statement from government spokesman Jerzy Urban said ofWalesa's efforts to end the strikes:   ``We appreciate any positive and reasonable step. The appeal tostop the strike is such a step. It should be especially valued whenit comes from a participant in the strikes.''   On Wednesday, Walesa met in Warsaw with Interior Minister Gen.Czeslaw Kiszczak and Stanislaw Ciosek, an alternate member of thePolitburo.   In a statement afterward, he said he raised the issues of unionpluralism and Solidarity's role. Authorities promised talks onthose points and on broad economic and political issues, he said.   Walesa toured the Lenin shipyard, other striking shipyards andthe Gdansk docks Thursday morning and won the agreement to end thestrikes.   He spent the afternoon on the telephone with striking dockworkers in Szczecin, the steel mill employees in Stalowa Wola andcoal miners at the July Manifesto mine in the Silesian town ofJastrzebie in southwestern Poland.   ``At present Walesa has the extremely important task of being inconstant telephone communication with the centers still on strike.It's a difficult matter,'' said Jacek Merkel, chairman of theGdansk Interfactory Strike Committee and an aide to Walesa.   At the July Manifesto mine, management laid in a specialtelephone line so Walesa could consult with the strikers who areadvised by Gdansk Solidarity activist Bogdan Lis, said Rybicki.   ``Bogdan Lis assured Walesa that the miners would end the strikesoon,'' the Solidarity spokesman said.   Earlier in the day, miners refused to take a call from Walesa inthe management office which is outside the mine gate, fearing itwas a trick to get them to leave the mine.   Piotr Niemczyk, a Solidarity spokesman in Warsaw, said strikersat the mine were demanding that Walesa make his appeal in person.The miners also want issues of higher pay and better workingconditions settled.   Urban's statement also said a policeman at the Stalowa Wola milldied while on duty Wednesday night, but the circumstances were notclear.   ``It is not known if he was murdered or committed suicide underpsychological terror or persecution,'' the statement said. ``I amawaiting results of the investigation.''   Niemczyk said strikers at Stalowa Wola reported that a policemanshot and killed himself but no details were available.   Bishop Jerzy Dabrowski sent a telegram to the mill workerssaying the church had undertaken discussions with authorities toguarantee ``personal and employee safety.''</TEXT></DOC>
