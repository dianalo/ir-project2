Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas, has expressed renewed interest in acquiring the deeply troubled thrift unit of Financial Corp. of America with massive government assistance, officials familiar with the negotiations said.    The officials, who declined to be identified, said negotiations between the Robert Bass Group and the staff of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board had intensified in recent weeks. However, they said it remains unclear whether the two sides will be able to agree on terms, including the amount of assistance required.    Meanwhile, Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. and other defendants in shareholder class-action lawsuits against the company have tentatively agreed to settle the suits for about $48 million, officials familiar with the agreement said.    The settlement would be funded in nearly equal amounts by three groups of defendants: Financial Corp. and its subsidiaries; Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., Financial Corp.'s former outside auditing firm; and nearly 20 former officers and directors, including former Chairman Charles W. Knapp.    Arthur Andersen and the former officers and directors as a group would pay equal amounts, the officials said, while Financial Corp. would pay slightly more than one-third, or about $16 million. The payments from Arthur Andersen and the former Financial Corp. officers and directors will be covered by insurance, the officials said. Financial Corp. currently is suing its former fidelity bond insurers for payment of related claims.    A Bank Board spokesman said the board is talking to various parties about proposals to acquire FCA's American Savings andamp; Loan Association unit but declined to identify any specific bidders. The spokesman said the board hasn't made a decision on any of the proposals and hasn't made a commitment to any transaction. The Robert Bass Group declined to comment.    A Financial Corp. spokeswoman said the company is currently engaged in settlement discussions, but a final settlement hasn't been reached. Arthur Andersen declined to comment. An attorney representing the former officers and directors couldn't be reached.    The Bank Board, which regulates thrifts and controls the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp., has been trying for more than a year to find a rescuer for the nation's second-largest thrift. Previously, the most serious potential acquirer was Ford Motor Co., but the Bank Board broke off talks with Ford in January.    The Bass Group, an investment arm of one member of the wealthy Bass family, has extensive real estate holdings and has indicated an interest in acquiring troubled thrifts. American Savings' assets of more than $30 billion include about $5 billion of troubled loans and foreclosed real estate, mostly in California and Texas.    The shareholder litigation against Financial Corp., Arthur Andersen and the former officers and directors dates back to 1983 and 1984. Financial Corp. agreed to settle its part of the litigation in 1986 for about $35 million in stock or cash, but the company last November exercised its option to cancel the settlement because its common stock price had fallen below $6.50 a share. The litigation alleges violations of state and federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties stemming from Financial Corp.'s serious financial difficulties since 1983.    Wesley Howell, a lawyer for Financial Corp., said yesterday that the $48 million settlement amount &quot;is certainly a number that has been agreed upon as a tentative number.&quot; He cautioned, however, that the settlement &quot;is by no means all buttoned up&quot; and that certain terms of the settlement may change.    Officials familiar with the settlement negotiations said a letter of understanding among the parties has been drafted but not yet signed by all parties to the litigation.    Financial Corp.'s earlier settlement applied to all shareholders who purchased Financial Corp. stock between April 1, 1980 and April 8, 1985. The total amount of claims received from such holders exceeded $400 million, Financial Corp. has said in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Financial Corp. common shares closed yesterday at $1.125 each, unchanged in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
