As his Civic Forum aides dine on pork chops and localwine, the first deputy prime minister and favored candidatein the district is subdued. Last November's &quot;VelvetRevolution&quot; ended 40 years of Communist rule. But the cloakof good will and consensus that wrapped the country isunraveling, as easy transitions to democracy and free marketsprove elusive.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The velvet has some holes in it now,&quot; says Mr. Komarek, a59-year-old academic economist. &quot;There is a sort ofpre-election restlessness, even aggressivity. The humanism isgone.&quot;   Tensions heightened after a bomb exploded in Prague's OldTown Square last Saturday, injuring 19 people and inflamingsuspicions that supporters of the old regime were bent ondisrupting this weekend's elections for the federalParliament and the Czech and Slovak republic legislatures.And at a Sunday rally in Cikhaj, east of Prague, a man madean aborted dagger attack on the chairman of the CzechoslovakPeople's Party.   These incidents could dissipate what solidarity remainedfrom Vaclav Havel's peaceful revolution as the countryprepares for its first free elections in four decades. Arending dispute over economic reforms has unsettled manypeople, who see no improvements in their life styles but hearincreasingly about threatened inflation and massunemployment. The reform government is criticized for lettingCommunists remain as industry managers and in seniorgovernment jobs, particularly with the security police.   Frictions resurfaced during this spring's &quot;hyphen crisis&quot;over Slovakia's demand that Czechoslovakia's name be changedto Czecho-Slovakia. A patchy compromise, allowing the Czechand Slovak republics to call the country what they want, onlyglossed over a simmering regional rivalry.   The shift in mood is striking in a country that, after alate start, threw off communism more completely than itsEastern European neighbors. But Czechoslovaks are stilllooking to leaders of the revolution to rekindle the firethat brought this country of more than 15 million to itsfeet. Above all, they still look to Mr. Havel, the morallyprincipled playwright-president, for unifying leadership.   Thus, the bulk of the electorate appears set to vote forCivic Forum -- the political movement of 14 small parties,ranging from conservatives to environmentalists, that Mr.Havel helped put together. Out of fear of and contempt forthe crippled Communist Party, Czechoslovaks seem willing tooverlook economic woes. Civic Forum is thus likely to beawarded a chance to settle into policy making for this nextParliament's abbreviated two-year term.   &quot;We are going to vote for them because they started therevolution and took all the risks,&quot; says Jiri Podlezak, a40-year-old Prague truck driver. His friend, Jan Pocinek,adds: &quot;A skilled worker will always get a job. . . . Theimportant thing is that the Communists don't get in.&quot;   Pre-election polls, a novelty here, are sketchy. But ofCzechoslovakia's 23 parties, Civic Forum and its PublicAgainst Violence affiliate in the Slovak Republic areexpected to get 30% to 40% of the national vote. In fact, thegroup expects a bigger vote when undecided voters make achoice on election day. &quot;The polls still support us,&quot; saysone Havel aide. &quot;There was a certain phase of discord twomonths ago, when the degree of disagreement was dangerouslyhigh, but people settled down and sorted things out.&quot;   One of the first acts of the newly elected Parliament willbe to choose a president. In a campaign of symbols, thispresents voters with a strong incentive for ensuring a largeCivic Forum faction in the national legislature, which wouldpreserve the strongest symbol of all: President Havel, whohas agreed to forgo another two years of writing if called.   Mr. Havel has somehow remained aloof from the squabbling.He has set the mood rather than specified the details of thecountry's political and economic reforms, which are left tothe cabinet. Indeed, the president has spent the bulk of histime traveling abroad &quot;to repair Czechoslovakia's image after40 years of totalitarianism,&quot; in the words of one aide.   More in the middle of the country's policy machinery isPrime Minister Marian Calfa, a former Communist who isrunning in his native Slovakia on the Public Against Violenceticket. Mr. Calfa says he would prefer a narrower coalitiongovernment than the confused Consensus Cabinet he has now,which still has two seats occupied by Communist Partymembers.   Civic Forum's likely coalition partner, Mr. Calfa says,would be the Christian Democratic Alliance, a newcenter-right group that is already the country'ssecond-strongest political grouping, with an estimated 13% ofthe vote. Receiving financial and logistical support fromWestern conservative parties -- including West Germany'sChristian Democrats -- the alliance is strongest in Slovakia.   As in the recent elections in East Germany and Hungary,most voters appear ready to shun anything that smacks ofleftwing ideology. Many other parties are either tainted bypast service in the National Front or are too new to allowthem to stand out from the crowd.   &quot;Every party here is saying the same thing -- supportingdemocracy and free markets; their true political identitieswon't emerge until after the elections, and that will becomea crucial phase for all of us,&quot; says Jan Skoda, vice chairmanof the Socialist Party, which is struggling to get the 5%minimum vote required for parliamentary representation, afterfailing to regain its reputation by merging with the SocialDemocratic Party.   &quot;The people don't want to hear the name socialism -- itgives them heartburn,&quot; says Mr. Skoda, whose party was moreof a centrist liberal party before World War II. &quot;It seemslogical that the pendulum is swinging to the right inCzechoslovakia, but probably not forever.&quot;   Civic Forum's opponents are biding their time, lookingbeyond this ballot to the 1992 elections. By then, theyreason, rising unemployment and fears of losing social safetynets could revitalize support for more leftward-leaningparties.</TEXT></DOC>
