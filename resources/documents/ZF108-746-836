Is DBASE somehow obsolete orold-fashioned in its approach to database management?andP;  In  the microcomputerbusiness, anything approaching 10 years of age is by definition elderly.andP;  Buttoday's DBASE isn't Ratliffs original invention.andP;  The DBASE Il data filestructure was enhanced in dBASE III.andP;  Then a variable-length memo field wasadded.andP;  Index structures have been improved by companies like Nantucket andFox, and even by Ashton-Tate.andP;  The user interface and programming languageelements have been continually extended and improved over the years.andP;  Thestate of the art represented by Clipper 5.0, FoxPro, dBASE IV, and newcomerslike Force prove that DBASE is far from stagnant.andP;  dBASE's design can bechallenged in the way physical data and index files are structured.andP;  InDBASE, each data table is a separate file, so it's possible to misplace one.andO;More seriously, relationships between data tables, records, and fields arecontrolled completely by explicit user actions.andP;  There's nothing built into adatabase file that lets it know about its indexes, or about how the filemight be related to or dependent on other data files.andP;  There's no mechanismlike a data dictionary to implicitly maintain field integrity (with thenotable exception of Vulean/Emerald Bay).andP;  In a pure sense, this is a designflaw that must be compensated for.andM;For interactive users, DBASE IV and FoxPro try to control file relationshipswith a View file system.andP;  However, in an application, the physical filestructure is a minor consideration since all files are managed completely bythe programmer.andP;  Users simply run their applications.andP;  Explicit programmercontrol over files is identical in scope in all major programming languages,from dBASE to C to BASIC to COBOL.andP;  In this area DBASE has one distinction:Managing files is much easier in DBASE since files are intelligent.andP;  Theyinclude headers that define their contents-the programmer doesn't have to.andO;Because of this, programming and maintenance are much faster and easier inDBASE.andP;  dBASE the survivorandM;Pointing to the unbroken success of dBASE doesn't prove it's the best, oreven better than alternatives.andP;  But it certainly proves that DBASE has beengood enough to meet the needs of a huge number of people for many, manyyears.andP;  Name another product introduced before the IBM PC that's still around(okay, WordStar).andP;  Now name one that's still a major force in the market (g'bye, WordStar).andP;  VisiCalc is gone, replaced by Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  SuperCalc andother surviving pre-PC products struggle on, unnoticed by the masses.andP;  DBASE11 successfully transported to the PC, evolved into DBASE III, and dominatedas dBASE Ill PLUS.andP;  It may be that DBASE is the longest-lived success storyin PC software.andP;  But it's no longer just DBASE, a product from Ashton-Tate.andO;It's now the data file, the programming language, and the command-drivenstandard found in dozens of products from dozens of companies.andM;The major playersandM;We can define major DBASE players in several ways, by: company size, marketpenetration, trend, potential, technical sophistication, price, supportedplatforms, interfaces available, and their influence on the influencers.andO;DBASE now exists for UNIX/XENIX (SCO FoxBASE+, Quicksilver, dBMan), theMacintosh FoxBASE+/Mac), VAX running VMS (Recital), mainframes  CA-DB:cBASE),and Microsoft Windows db-Fast/Windows), with more on the way.andP;  Clipper 5.0'suser-defined commands and replaceable database engine, FoxPro's speed andcharacter-based windows, and Force's dBASE-to-C approach are examples of theexplosive advances in DBASE technology that continue to lead the market.andM;dBASE has something to offer almost every PC user, but in very differentways.andP;  It's all in how you look at it and what you want to see-like lookingat the Mona Lisa.andP;  One person notices the smile, another sees the woman,someone else observes a painting, an aficionado beholds art, while the expertrecognizes a masterpiece.andP;  In the early days, DBASE II and Ill were sold toalmost everyone who bought a computer: &quot;Here's your IBM PC.andP;  Of course you'llneed a copy of Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar, and DBASE.&quot; Lots of people who boughtDBASE didn't use more than 10 percent of its power.andP;  Thus arose the DBASEprofessional, someone who knew how to make DBASE sit up and jump throughhoops.andP;  DBASE applications started to appear in companies far and wide,solving major business problems.andP;  Developing in DBASE was wonderfully fastand flexible.andP;  Early dBASE developers became the self-made experts whomeveryone else looked to for advice.andP;  Someone who knew how to-program in DBASEbecame a very influential person, affecting the actions of lots of others.andM;Once the pioneer, DBASE paved the way, compatible products appeared toenhance it, then to work like it, then to work better than it.andP;  Now it'spossible to use a bewildering array of software that's somehow dBASE-related,each offering a unique combination of features.andM;As dBASE-compatible products appeared, DBASE experts embraced some andrejected others.andP;  The more a product extended the power and improved theoutput of a DBASE developer, the more accepted it was.andP;  Clipper and Fox owetheir existence to people who knew enough about DBASE to recognizesuperiority when they saw it.andP;  The influencers tried the better products,then started telling everybody else.andP;  Over the years, more and more peopledrifted away from the mother product, Ashton-Tate's dBASE.andP;  Products withrelatively small sales became anointed by experts as &quot;the best,&quot; therebyinfluencing the direction of the DBASE market.andP;  Showing a DBASE Ill PLUS userthe power of Clipper or the speed of FoxBASE+ is like revealing the secretsof a master magician.andP;  The status of the standard As the DBASE marketproliferates, it becomes more difficult to define.andP;  Support for the DBF filestructure is almost universal, though perhaps not essential.andP;  The drivingforce behind DBASE is its programming language, yet this is where productsdiverge the most.andP;  Some don't support the language, giving the user a maze ofmenus.andP;  The trend-setting products from Fox, Nantucket, and WordTech alloffer extensive language support, but the resulting dialects diverge from the&quot;standard&quot; offered by Ashton-Tate.andP;  This raises a critical question.andP;  If theprogramming language is the core feature, and vendors compete by &quot;extending&quot;it, at what point do they no longer have anything in common? If you'veexperienced the range of English as spoken in America, Australia, Britain,Ireland, and Scotland, you know the challenges that language divergencecreates.andM;Some have been tempted to officially define the DBASE language as a standardby starting with DBASE Ill PLUS, and adding the &quot;basic&quot; extensions supportedby both FoxBASE+ and Clipper Summer  87.andP;  This approach unfortunately leadsto a one-size-fits-nobody definition.andP;  Some developers, unwilling to committo a single DBASE dialect, try to use only the subset of language componentssupported by these three major products.andP;  The resulting applicationsinevitably suffer when compared to unrestrained Clipper or Fox programming.andM;The likely outcome of conformance is mediocrity.andP;  However, the danger ofdivergence is incompatibility, which leads eventually to separation.andP;  Severalof today's human languages started out as Latin (French, Italian, Portuguese,Romanian, and Spanish), but none are Latin now.andP;  And Latin is long dead.andP;  IfAshton-Tate, with its name, size, and money, was still leading the market,this rift wouldn't happen.andP;  Since there's no evidence that A-T will be ableto regain technological leadership, sophisticated developers have no choicebut to follow the new trailblazers-the trail may lead right out of the DBASEworld.andM;Ashton-Tate vs.andP;  FoxandM;The big DBASE news of 1988 was Ashton-Tate's three-part fiasco.andP;  They had anopportunity to buy Fox Software, including FoxBASE+, the superb FoxBASE+(Mac,and the foundations of FoxPro.andP;  But A-T's offer was a few million dollars toolow.andM;Instead (Fiasco Two), they spent quite a bit more than the Fox price-tagdeveloping DBASE IV, a seriously flawed product that's only now about to befixed.andM;Fiasco Three was the lawsuit Ashton-Tate filed against Fox Software, allegingcopyright infringement based on the similarity of FoxBASE+ to DBASE Ill PLUS.andO;Fox countered with a suit alleging, among other things, that A-T stole ideaswhile evaluating Fox technology during the purchase negotiations.andP;  The caseon both sides has merit, the outcome is far from certain, and the wheels ofjustice grind slowly.andP;  A-T claims Fox copied the key ingredients of DBASE IIIPLUS and put them into FoxBASE+.andP;  So many components are so similar that theclaim has merit-if the law protects such things as screens and commands.andO;That's an open question without clear precedent.andP;  Fox points to the elementsin dBASE IV that existed in Fox products.andP;  Where did A-T get them, if notfrom Fox?andM;The developer community is most concerned about Ashton-Tate's claim toownership of the DBASE programming language.andP;  No language has ever beencopyrighted.andP;  One-party ownership has the potential to stifle innovation andraise costs.andP;  Wayne Ratliff says no one can own the language he put in DBASE,since it was derived from JPLDIS, a public-domain database manager (you can'tcopyright something already in the public domain).andP;  Former Ashton-Tate CEO EdEsber hinted he would be satisfied if Fox acknowledged A-T's rights and paida license fee.andP;  New A-T president Bill Lyons is not ready to change course.andO;Fox CEO Dave Fulton wants his day in court.andP;  There has been no materialprogress in over a year.andP;  If the parties don't settle, the case will probablytake years to resolve.andM;dBASE market sizeandM;How many DBASE users are there? That's always been the multi-million dollarquestion.andP;  No one really knows how many people own a dBASE-type product, oruse one, or program with one, or somehow benefit from one.andP;  Marketresearchers estimate that a copy of dBASE has been purchased for roughly oneout of 10 DOS computers-that's about three million.andP;  That number may be justthe tip of the iceberg.andP;  Many more people use DBASE than ever bought it.andO;Some, regrettably, use DBASE illegally, taking advantage of the fact thatmost products aren't copy protected.andP;  Powerful, expensive products alwaysmanage to find their way into the hands of the unethical, so a fair number ofDBASE installations are uncountable.andM;Local Area Network (LAN) nodes create an additional user base.andP;  A single copyof Clipper or FoxBASE+dm can legally serve everyone on a network.andP;  There'salso no accounting for the number and nature of these network users.andP;  Perhapsthe largest uncounted group is made up of the beneficiaries of DBASEprogrammers.andP;  Since most developers use Clipper or FoxBASE+/FoxPro, they candistribute compiled applications without anyone buying an additional copy.andO;(Fox offers an optional runtime license authorizing unlimited distributionwith compiled applications; Clipper links its runtime into the core productand allows unlimited distribution of applications.) Users of compiledapplications may not even know DBASE is involved.andP;  It may be that the totalnumber of people who somehow use DBASE, legally or not, knowingly orotherwise, ranges from five, 10, or even 15 million.andP;  How many developers?andM;This important sub-group of users taps dBASE's major advantage, itsprogramming language.andP;  Those who use the language to write completeapplications are called developers.andP;  Applications can be categorized at twolevels, functionality and architecture.andP;  Even programs to do modest thingscan be internally sophisticated, while complex applications require complexdesign.andP;  Novice programmers often use Ashton-Tate's DBASE III PLUS or dBASEIV.andP;  Intermediate developers might step up to inexpensive but superior dBXLand Vulcan.andP;  Advanced programmers flock to Clipper, FoxBASE+, and FoxPro.andO;How many programmers? No one knows.andP;  The companies with products used heavilyby dBASE-language programmers won't reveal their unit sales, and the numberof buyers who program is open to speculation-so let's speculate.andM;If five to 10 percent of dBASE product owners use it for applicationdevelopment-, that might be 150,000 to 300,000 total independent developers,company staff programmers, and part-time commercial and recreationalprogrammers with skills ranging from novice to pro.andP;  How many of those arepros, those people whose livelihood depends on the dBASE language? Perhaps athird, from 50,000 to 100,000.andP;  Maybe more.andP;  Ashton-Tate used to claim that20 percent of DBASE buyers use the language capabilities (actually theyclaimed that 80 percent did not).andP;  Senior DBASE guru Adam Green thinks 10 to20 percent of users are in the professional category; he estimates as many ashalf a million people earn their living from DBASE in some way.andP;  Thisinvisible group is the vocal minority of the dBASE world, the driving forcebehind many improvements and trends.andM;There's money to be made in the DBASE market, but only for the right productat the right time.andP;  A couple of years ago, Ashton-Tate sold almost $300million worth of dBASE a year.andP;  The technical shortcomings  of dBASE IV,coupled with the availability of superior alternatives, dropped AT's sales by25 percent in 1989.andP;  Some of that lost revenue has gone to firms sellingdBASE-compatible products, and some has undoubtedly gone to non-dBASEalternatives.andP;  Part of A-T's lost revenue may turn out to be deferredpurchases, as buyers wait for an improved DBASE IV before upgrading fromDBASE Ill PLUS.andP;  Figures for privately-held companies aren't available, butsome analysts estimate Nantucket at about $20 million in annual sales, fueledby the promise that buyers of Clipper Summer '87 can upgrade to Clipper 5.0.andO;Fox Software's new hit, FoxPro, may have pushed them toward $25 million.andO;These figures reflect wholesale sales; distributors and resellers add another20 percent or so.andP;  Green estimates that some 200 thousand copies of Clipperand FoxPro have been sold into the DBASE professional market.andP;  Sales of allDBASE products combined may total about $500 million a year.andM;The most unsung part of the market, dBASE-related services such asprogramming, training, and add-ons, is by far the largest.andP;  Here's onemid-range estimate: 100,000 DBASE professionals, earning an average of$50,000 per year, generate $5,000,000,000 (that's $5 billion) by helpingcomputer owners use the power of DBASE.andP;  In other words, the money spentimplementing DBASE solutions is 10 times greater than the money spent buyingDBASE products.andM;The magnitude of this ratio hasn't been lost on DBASE publishers.andO;Ashton-Tate has always tried to charge per-user by selling individual runtimeand network node licenses.andP;  The marketplace, led by Nantucket, has rejectedthis approach.andP;  A-T liberalized their runtime licensing in DBASE IV andpromises to adopt Nantucket's approach when the DBASE Professional Compilerappears.andP;  An unlimited runtime license is available for FoxPro Runtime, andthe promised FoxPro compiler will allow unlimited distribution of compiledapplications.andP;  So the language-product publishing companies aren't able toshare in the revenues of the service end of the DBASE market.andP;  This isn't asunfair as some publishers claim.andP;  The manufacturers of motion picture filmand cameras didn't get a share of the profits from &quot;Star Wars.&quot; Ford MotorCompany doesn't get a per-mile fee from taxi drivers.andP;  And DBASE developersdon't earn commissions when clients use custom-written applications forgreater profits.andP;  At some point in the economic chain the value added to anyproduct gets transferred to someone else.andM;The futureandM;Whether the DBASE world can grow, or even maintain, isn't a certainty, mainlybecause A-T has failed to sustain leadership.andP;  Their image and momentumbrings them continuing sales, but they don't seem able to offer a vision ofwhere dBASE can and should go.andP;  The market needs direction, and it expectsthe first and largest participant to provide it.andP;  A-T's new president, BillLyons, knows this.andP;  His goal is to re-establish DBASE as the standard.andM;Computer industry influencers, the people who lead everyone else, are alwayslooking for the next direction.andP;  Right now they're betting mostly onNantucket and Fox.andP;  But technical achievement isn't enough, and bothcompanies exhibit the disappointing qualities attributed to Ashton-Tate tosome degree.andP;  Targeted release dates are missed by wide marks, products arereleased with bugs, and technical support is often short of the mark.andP;  On theother hand, maybe users expect too much from software companies, who feed theproblem by enthusiastically promising the impossible.andP;  Perhaps we shouldacknowledge that software development isn't a predictable science, bugs areinevitable, a solid design and quick fixes are what count, and great techsupport people are nowhere to be found.andP;  Still, it seems the major companiesdo put themselves into untenable positions.andM;Every new product brings enthusiastic anticipation, followed by hands-onexperience, followed sometimes by disillusionment.andP;  Each time through theloop users become less gullible, more skeptical.andP;  Among experienceddevelopers, tolerance for double-talk is at an all-time low.andP;  It would be ashame if the DBASE world decays because mismanagement, inter-companysquabbles, and competitive gamesmanship take the place of visionary technicalleadership and customer satisfaction.andP;  Some say DBASE vendors are so busyfighting each other that they're failing to present the remarkable strengthsof DBASE to the rest of the computer and business worlds.andP;  DBASE iswonderful, but if it loses credibility, application developers won't miss abeat; they'll just find another way to earn their billions of dollars.andO;Meanwhile, outsiders, who can't tell the players without a scorecard, won'tcare to sort it all out.andP;  It will be too easy to see DBASE as a fallen idoland move on to the next glorious promise.andP;  As Pogo put it, &quot;We have met theenemy and it is us.&quot;andM;John L. Hawkins is president of Hawk-Tek Corp., a national computerconsulting, training, database development and VAR firm, author of a book ondBASE language programming, and Contributing Editor of Data Based Advisor.andO;Reach him on the Data Based Advisor Readers Exchange BBS, (619) 270-2042, orat P.O. Box 6476, San Rafael, Calif.andP;  94903, (415) 491 -HAWK.andM;New A-T Boss Seeks Middle GroundandM;Some Ashton-Tate watchers anticipated fireworks at the late Aprilshareholder's meeting.andP;  How long would the board of directors tolerate theon-going losses and inability to ship a satisfactory DBASE IV? The answer,apparently, was no longer.andP;  On April 30, Edward M. Esber, Jr.andP;  resigned aschairman and chief executive officer.andP;  Board member Dr. Carmelo J. Santorowas elected non-executive chairman.andP;  A director since 1983, Santoropreviously served as chairman.andP;  William P. Lyons was named president andchief operating officer.andM;Lyons has been with Ashton-Tate since October  1988.andP;  He was the head oftheir PC Applications division and responsible for almost every PC andMacintosh product except the DBASE family.andP;  Esber retained a position on theboard, but is expected to have no further involvement in A-T management.andM;Many critics claimed Esber was the problem.andP;  If so, is Lyons the solution?andO;Ashton-Tate's problems were a long time in coming.andP;  A turnaround may hinge onthe release of an acceptable version of DBASE IV, followed by a more rapidresponse to the marketplace.andP;  Though he can't immediately affect the longcourse of dBASE development, Lyons does intend to redefine A-T's release andsupport strategy.andM;&quot;Perfect software is too high an ambition,&quot; Lyons told me recently.andP;  We needto be mindful of how people use [DBASE IV], and be sensitive to what theyfind and report.&quot; Esber's strategy was to withhold DBASE IV 1.1 until it wasready.andP;  Lyons, a 19-year veteran of IBM, is more pragmatic.andP;  &quot;We must delivera quality product, then focus on how to handle the process of regular fixesand updates.andP;  We can't stop the process when we deliver the product.'andM;In other words, while DBASE IV 1.0 appeared to be 'tossed over the wall,'version 1.andP;  l's imperfections will be supported by a responsive updatepolicy.andP;  As long as problems aren't too severe and corrections are prompt,this release-fix-rerelease cycle will probably be acceptable to users.andP;  It'sthe same method used by dBASE's competitors.andP;  This policy was conspicuouslyabsent with the flawed DBASE IV 1.0, but A-T now acknowledges 1.0's problemswere too deep for quick fixes.andP;  Lyons foresees improved developer relationsthrough bug fixes, product improvements, solid technical support, developermarketing support, and a new openness and accessibility.andP;  We've heard allthis before, of course, from Esber at the 1988 Developers Conference.andP;  TheSeptember 1990 Developers Conference will be fresh-start Number Two forAshton-Tate and programmers who want to stick with the standard.andM;Beyond DBASE IV 1.1, Lyons plans to focus on cost control to return toprofitability, as well as on new products.andP;  He said Ashton-Tate's goal ofproviding DBASE for every platform will happen &quot;sooner than you think.andP;  We'vebeen doing parallel, cross-platform development.' DBASE IV versions for theMacintosh, UNIX, and VAX are in the works, as are SQL support and a compiler.andO;Lyons sees these products as more than sales opportunities.andP;  They givestrategic power to companies that adopt DBASE.andP;  The secret to productivitygains is getting access to more data,&quot; he says.andP;  Lyons sees Ashton-Tateproviding &quot;the standard front-end across heterogeneous hardware platforms.'andM;We're really seeing it in its infancy.andP;  It's going through a lot ofiterations, and it just has to grow up.andP;  I think in the year 2010, you and Iwill be here over the phone wondering if dBASE is dead.andP;  We'll be asking thesame questions, but the cooks will be different.andP;  We'll be asking: Do youthink Ashton-Tate is going to make another comeback like they did in theearly  90s? It's quite humorous.andM;Bill French, VP., DevelopmentandM;Global TechnologiesandM;Comatose, not dead.andM;Scott RobertsonandM;PresidentandM;Champion BusinessandM;SystemsandM;The simple fact that over 1,900 dBASE-language utilities have been createdhas ensured that the DBASE language won't be dead for a very long time tocome.andM;Eric Engelmann President EMSandM;The entire DBASE phenomenon is an historical quirk.andP;  Similar historicalquirks include COBOL and Communism.andP;  Someday they'll all be gone, and theywon't be missed.andP;  DBASE was never a  good' product, although over its 10-yearlife it was occasionally the best available choice.andP;  If Microsoft had simplybundled an ISAM into DOS 2.0 and included a good interface to BASICA, 90percent of the copies extant of dBASE would never have been sold.andP;  dBASE'sDBF and NDX file formats will be the lowest common denominator for lots ofproducts for a long time-kind of the EDLIN of database formats.andP;  To such daysare we doomed.andM;Joshua Stern, President Datatrope Corp.andM;If DBASE language vendors abandon reliance on litigation and return totechnological advances for their competitive edge, perhaps dBASE willsurvive.andP;  if DBASE is allowed to continue to evolve as a language, ratherthan merely as a software product, perhaps it will become the  old dog&quot; ofthe '90s.andP;  if not, we'd all better get used to riding brontosaurs.andM;Ken Henderson, PresidentandM;Software Springs, Inc.andM;With apologies to Mr. Twain, I think the reports of dBASE's demise have beengreatly exaggerated.andP;  Learning a new interface and programming language is amajor undertaking and migrating large files to a new environment is alwaysrisky.andP;  Any challenger to DBASE would have to offer a large benefit to offsetthe risks and hassles of such a conversion.andP;  The feedback I've had fromclients and fellow developers has not indicated a willingness to take thatrisk just yet.andM;Jacqueline Jonas, Senior Technical WriterandM;FlipTrack Learning SystemsandM;It's very much alive.andP;  We expect to see the long awaited DBASE IV 1.1.andO;FoxPro is shipping, and it's one of the most exciting products I've everseen.andP;  Clipper 5.0 is going to be demonstrated in the very near future.andP;  Sothere's a lot going on.andP;  DBASE is very much alive in the Macintosh andXENIX/UNIX markets, as well.andP;  They're proliferating into other environments,so it's proliferating as a language and it's replacing BASIC as the businessprogramming language for personal computers.andP;  it's pretty clear to us thatwhen you compare dBASE to others, it comes up the winner.andP;  We haven't seenanything on the horizon that is going to replace it.andP;  And it's evolving veryrapidly.andM;Robert Davies President SBT Corp.andM;I hope not.andP;  it's too powerful and has too much momentum, and there is reallynothing to take its place.andM;Neil Weicher President Communication HorizonsandM;There are more dBASE programmers than users of any other database product inany environment.andP;  The overall investment in dBASE applications runs into thetens of billions of dollars and the collective experience base of DBASEprogrammers in the millions of human-years.andP;  A database language with thefollowing garnered by dBASE does not die easily.andP;  Ashok Ahuja ManagementConsultant Richard Roth President Desktop Al, inc.andM;Q: What can Ashton-Tate do to save itself?andM;Offer a bug-free DBASE IV with a tight, fast, interpreter-compatiblecompiler; a client-server architecture; and better control over nested READand ON commands.andP;  This could bring a lot of attention back to Ashton-Tate.andO;Throwing in stronger support for LaserJet and PostScript printers-such asscalable fonts and graphics-would also be great assets.andM;A version of that product that supports the Windows/Presentation Managerenvironment would broaden the appeal even more, particularly if it couldsomehow be implemented so that one could upgrade a character-basedapplication to a graphical user interface without starting over from scratch.andO;A little voice in the back of my mind just said, &quot;Sure, Alan, and maybe itwill serve you breakfast as well.&quot;andM;Alan SimpsonandM;AuthorandM;The people who built and maintained and tried to sell dBASE IV, and have hadtwo years to try to fix it, shouldn't be the ones who try to, continue fixingit.andP;  They should get new people.andP;  it's the only way to make new products.andM;Adam GreenandM;Database Author andandM;LecturerandM;Ashton-Tate obviously were buying a house or a use you do a title search tomake sure it was clear? Ashton-Tate has lawsuits against Fox, but Fox alsohas lawsuits against Ashton-Tate, alleging that they fraudulently obtainedthe copyright on dBASE and stole source code and technology from Fox andincorporated them into dBASE IV.andP;  Now what company is going to buy out acompany unless lawsuits like that have been settled?andM;Pat Adams Independent consultant and Founding Treasurer of IDBUG DB UnlimitedandM;Q:andM;Can Ashton-Tate ever return to the glory days of undisputed marketleadership?andM;The answer hinges on the next version of DBASE.andP;  You know, it used to be thatalmost everyone going in to buy a new microcomputer system also bought abasic set of software applications-a word processor, a spread sheet, and adatabase.andP;  That was standard equipment.andP;  But now, with the premature releaseof dBASE IV and the problems which ensued, it's brought about the question asto whether a database application needs to be part of that initial purchaseor not.andM;As to whether or not Ashton-Tate will ever return to its &quot;glory days&quot; is hardto tell.andM;Dan Pines President Bytel Corp.andM;It's unfortunate that they really have nobody to blame but themselves.andP;  Theother competitors in the same marketplace were common enemies, but they allprovided an incentive, a goal to hit or miss.andP;  it's a good question as towhether those companies will be as strong and dynamic DBASE withoutAshton-Tate.andP;  Ashton-Tate is a necessary evil for them.andM;Neil Weicher President Communication HorizonsandM;A-T's only hope would be for them to get down on their knees and beg RSPI tocome in and completely take over the database development division.andP;  With theEmerald Bay database technology behind a reinvigorated, more Vulcan-likeDBASE language, A-T could very quickly return to the glory days.andP;  Anythingless than this radical solution is, I'm afraid, much like bailing water froma sinking ship with a teaspoon.andM;John P. Hey GMT Corp.andM;Ashton-Tate has to turn back to engineering.andP;  I don't think they can if theykeep doing things the same way they have for the last two years.andP;  I thinkthey got burned, and they released the product too prematurely.andP;  Now theyhave become overly cautious.andP;  They now are not going to take any chances, andyou can't do that.andP;  They should put more effort into developing new productsinstead of suing, and trying to use legal tactics to intimidate othercompanies.andP;  Ben Tse, President SourceMate information Systems, inc.andM;A huge installed base of users is a tough obstacle for any competitor toovercome.andP;  The cost of converting to another product can be prohibitive for alarge organization with many installed copies of DBASE.andP;  In addition, theincremental functionality provided in an upgrade or even the lack of asatisfactory upgrade will generally not convince an organization to take theplunge to convert from DBASE to another product.andM;David Johnson, President Pinnacle PublishingandM;For the moment it's rapidly losing market supremacy.andM;Alan Wyn Jones Owner and Head of DevelopmentandM;Wallsoft Systems Bigness isn't the same as leadership in my book.andP;  That's whycompanies like Champion are taking market share away from  elephanttechnology&quot; companies.andP;  Big, ugly, and slow isn't exciting except in mudwrestling.andP;  Scott Robertson President Champion Business SystemsandM;The bottom line is dollar revenue.andP;  Ashton-Tate still sells more than anybodyelse in the DBASE style of language.andP;  If I'm a stockholder for Ashton-Tate,that's my bottom line-are we selling more than nybody else?andM;Richard ComeauandM;PresidentandM;Buzzwords International, Inc.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
