Gen.Richard Neal, deputy director of operations for the U.S. Central Command.;   &quot;The purpose is to maintain a presence until the cease-fire is agreed to,&quot;Neal said.;    The two Army units are among six U.S. divisions containingabout 127,000 men still occupying Iraqi territory. Some of the U.S. troops arepositioned within a few dozen miles of Basra, the site of repeated clashesbetween government and rebel forces.;    Bush has signaled that U.S. forcesmay resume air attacks if Saddam's government uses chemical weapons againstrebels and has warned Saddam to stop using his helicopter forces to put downresistance.;    Among the latest reported developments in the Iraqi revolt,Kurdish rebels charged that government troops rounded up civilians Thursday inthe northern oil city of Kirkuk and then massacred them with weapons fire fromhelicopter gunships.;    The territory along the Euphrates is the northernmostpart of a vast area of southern Iraq seized by U.S. and allied forces duringthe four-day ground offensive that forced Saddam to relinquish his occupationof Kuwait.;    The river valley region had earlier been vacated as 101stAirborne and 1st Cavalry units began to move south in anticipation of a U.S.withdrawal from Iraq once Saddam's government had complied with terms of afinal cease-fire accord.;    In ordering U.S. forces to reoccupy theterritory, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. forces in thePersian Gulf, made clear that &quot;he wanted them on that ground,&quot; Neal said.;   The reassertion of the U.S. choke-hold over much of southern Iraq appears tobe intended to send a clear signal to Saddam that he must exercise caution indealing with the domestic rebellion or risk another confrontation with U.S.forces.;    Fighting reported;    Heavy fighting was reported Thursday insouthern Iraq, where Shiite Muslim activists also are seeking to toppleSaddam.;    The Shiite rebels claimed units from Saddam's Republican Guard hittwo of Shiite Islam's most sacred shrines with artillery in the city ofKarbala, according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.;    Thenews agency said an unidentified spokesman for the Patriotic Union ofKurdistan opposition group reported that troops &quot;forced residents of some ofthe areas in Kirkuk . . . to leave the city and then strafed them withhelicopters, killing a fairly large number.&quot;;    Iranian radio reported thatrebels killed an official of Iraq's ruling Baath Party and 18 other governmentofficials during fighting in the northeastern Kurdish province ofSuleimaniyah.;    In southern Iraq, Shiite rebels reported continued fightingin Basra and Karbala, two cities earlier reported under government control.;   It was impossible to confirm the reports. No Western reporters have been ableto witness fighting in Iraq in recent days.;    Iraq denies clashes;    Theofficial Iraqi News Agency, meanwhile, said reports of fighting Wednesday inthe capital of Baghdad were &quot;fabricated, baseless and completely unfounded.&quot;;   Tehran Radio had reported clashes between government forces anddemonstrators that left many dead in Baghdad.;    One knowledgeable Pentagonofficial noted that the reoccupation of the Euphrates River Valley territoryalso appears intended to correct a hastier-than-expected rearward movement byU.S. military commanders.;    U.S. commanders have been eager, in the wake oftheir victory, to reposition themselves in areas that are closer to theirsupplies and where land mines and unexploded ordnance do not pose dailythreats to U.S. soldiers, the official said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910315  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  710  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 15, 199100075099,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
