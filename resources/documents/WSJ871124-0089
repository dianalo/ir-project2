Following the announcement last week of an accord in the U.S. to narrow the budget deficit, the so-called Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- is expected to meet to discuss stabilization of exchange rates and coordination of economic policies. Germany is expected to be pressed at such a meeting to implement policies that would help stimulate domestic demand and narrow trade imbalances.    &quot;The Federal Republic can't go into such talks with empty hands,&quot; said Helmut Hesse, one of the council's five economic experts, at a news conference yesterday. Measures to be presented at a G-7 meeting could range from projects for reduced subsidies to the deregulation of Germany's telecommunications monopoly to cuts in certain consumer taxes, he said.    However, echoing the policy line of the government, he added that Bonn can't be expected to hand its Western trading partners &quot;on a silver platter&quot; the bold initiatives being demanded, a reference to calls, especially from Washington, that Germany bring forward tax cuts scheduled for 1990. &quot;They can't require us to make the same mistakes as were made in America,&quot; he said, commenting on Germany's need to control its growing budget deficit.    While a majority of the council ruled out the acceleration of tax cuts, one of its members, Ruediger Pohl, a Hagen University professor, said in a minority opinion that because of troublesome weakness in the economy, the tax reform should get under way immediately.    The council as a whole, in presenting its findings to the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, stressed that fueling growth should be the government's top priority in the coming months. Only in this way can Bonn stem rising unemployment, now at 8.6% of the labor force, the report said.    The independent council, also known as the five wise men, said its prediction for growth in Germany's inflation-adjusted gross national product, adjusted for inflation, had been revised downward by half a percentage point following the turbulence on financial markets. That alteration made their prediction for the total output of goods and services one of the gloomiest to date. The official government forecast for 1988 places the growth rate at around 2.25%. The country's five leading economic institutes, in a recent report, predicted 2% growth for next year.    In a joint communique, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Economics Minister Martin Bangemann said the council's outlook for economic growth was too pessimistic. Otherwise, they hailed the report as &quot;confirmation&quot; of their policy course.    Indeed, in many key areas, the report followed closely the government line. It stressed the need to lessen &quot;structural&quot; limitations to growth in order to increase Germany's competitiveness. It called for a liberalization of telecommunications and of the labor market, where wages at present are strictly controlled -- two pet projects of Mr. Stoltenberg. But the report also said rigid laws governing shop hours should be relaxed, and it warned against the indefinite continuation of government subsidies for Airbus, the European aerospace program.    &quot;The real difficulties lie in the political translation of the things that are recognized as important,&quot; the report added. </TEXT></DOC>
