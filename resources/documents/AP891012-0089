Manuel Noriega charged in an interviewpublished today.   Noriega also claimed that Nicaraguan Contras and Panamanianbusinessmen delivered money and relayed messages between U.S.officials and coup plotters, the Los Angeles Times and The BostonGlobe reported.   ``The United States was involved before, during and after thecoup,'' Noriega said in a joint interview. ``They had to make thecontacts, woo them, convince them. It's a lot of work before you'vehooked the fish. But they were the hook and the useful fools werethe fish.''   ``The Contras put them in contact with the United States,''Noriega said of the coup leaders.   The military ruler said that forces loyal to him detained 77rebel soldiers after the attempted coup. Previous reports said 37soldiers were arrested.   The two reporters conducting the interview received sternwarnings from a Noriega aide to avoid questioning Noriega aboutallegations that 10 of those arrested have been executed, the Timessaid.   Noriega, according to the Globe, said that he had crushed twoplots from within the defense forces, the second being plannedunder the direction of Col. Guillermo Wong, chief of intelligenceand a member of Noriega's general staff. He said that on the day ofthe coup, Wong received several long-distance calls from anunidentified U.S. military officer in Washington. He said Wong isunder arrest.   He also there was no truth to reports he had been detainedduring the coup attempt. ``I dominated the situation totally,'' hesaid. ``When I started to talk with them, it was all over.''   Noriega, speaking in Panama City, Panama, accused Everett E.Briggs, the U.S. National Security Council's senior director ofLatin American affairs, of involvement in the failed coup.   Briggs, who has served as U.S. ambassador to Panama andHonduras, where the Contras were based, was linked to the coupbecause he visited Panama shortly before the uprising, Noriega said.   There was no comment from Briggs or any NSC official in thenewspaper reports.   Noriega said his investigators discovered the existence of abank account containing more than $1 million in the name of Capt.Erick A. Murillo, one of the alleged coup leaders.   ``There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian. Sixzeroes. It was a million-dollar account,'' Noriega said.   He claimed U.S. officials gave Murillo the money for bribes, butwould not identify the bank holding the alleged account.   Murillo, a member of the Panama Defense Forces' elite Battalion2000, was one of 10 officers the government said was killed duringthe uprising.   Noriega said one of the detained soldiers was found with$700,000 in cash, allegedly used to bribe rank-and-file soldiers.He said the soldier remained in custody but refused to identify him.   He claimed the attempted coup was organized by 17 members of thePanama Defense Forces, Noriega said.   He said several coup leaders had ties with Contras establishedduring attendance at the Nicaraguan Military Academy before theleftist Sandinistas overthrew Nicaraguan leader Anastasio Somoza in1979.   Noriega named Panamanian Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, the reputedleader of this month's coup attempt, and Capt. Edgardo Sandoval asonetime students of the Nicaraguan military school.   He said Sandoval was a classmate of Luis Alfonso Moreno Payan, amember of the Nicaraguan National Guard who later joined theU.S.-backed Contras and operated under the name Mike Lima.   He said other Contras and Panamanian businessmen were involved,but declined to name them.   Asked how he could protect himself against any future coups,Noriega said:   ``The world was created with good men and bad. Abel didn't knowCain was going to kill him. ... The significance of this is thatthe Defense Forces now wears the long pants.   ``How do you consolidate an armed force? On the basis of yourerrors.''</TEXT></DOC>
