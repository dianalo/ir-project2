The high resolutionof new generation CT equipment allows definitive evaluation of bony disruptionwithin the spinal column. Multiplanar image reformation permits three-dimensionalassessment of the injury, optimizes patient comfort and safety, and minimizesthe time necessary for the diagnosis. Water-soluble contrast can be usedto expand greatly the utility of computed tomography. Utilizing the cervicalpuncture approach, small doses of contrast can be instilled in the subarachnoidspace with the patient supine and semi-upright on a tiltable gurney.Such contrast enhancement can provide additional information in acutelytraumatized patients with neurologic deficits. Dynamic sequence scanningwith automatic table incrementation permits thorough evaluation of severespinal trauma in less than 15 minutes following patient transfer ontothe scanning couch. Because of its many advantages, CT has become thediagnostic procedure of choice in the evaluation of spinal injury whenplain films and/or clinical data indicate the need for further diagnosticmeasures.</TEXT></DOC>
