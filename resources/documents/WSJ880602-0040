First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, has signed a letter of intent to lease about 650,000 square feet of the project, and to serve as anchor tenant. IBM will lease 233,000 square feet of the complex, which will bear the First Bank System name. Costs and terms of the project and leasing weren't disclosed.    The project, designed by I.M. Pei andamp; Partners, will contain 1.3 million square feet of office space and 38,000 square feet of retail space in three main components: a 58-story office tower; an 18-story building, and a circular 14-story atrium. Construction of the granite-and-glass buildings will begin early 1989, with initial occupancy scheduled for summer of 1991.    IBM eventually will locate about 850 workers in the complex, including its central area marketing headquarters. It will be managing partner of the joint venture, and will develop the project. Opus is a limited partner, and will be general contractor for the project. Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM employs about 8,000 people in Minnesota. </TEXT></DOC>
