The 382-12 vote sent the measure to the Senate, where final congressional approval is expected this week, perhaps as soon as today, before lawmakers leave for a month-long recess.    Before yesterday's House debate, some lawmakers had complained that by privately negotiating with Treasury Secretary James Baker and agreeing to last-minute changes in the bill, the chairmen of the House and Senate Banking Committees had capitulated to the Reagan administration and bypassed the House-Senate conference committee. But there wasn't any significant opposition on the House floor.    The two chairmen -- Rep. Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.) and Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.) -- last week agreed to increase the amount the FSLIC could raise to $10.8 billion from the $8.5 billion level of an earlier conference agreement. In exchange, they received President Reagan's assurance that he wouldn't veto the measure. The change was affirmed by the conference committee last Wednesday.    Under the legislation, the FSLIC, which ended 1986 with a $6.3 billion deficit, would be limited to raising no more than $3.75 billion a year. The bonds wouldn't be guaranteed by the government. The bill also would direct the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees the FSLIC, to ease its treatment of struggling thrifts in economically pressed areas during the life of the bonding program.    The bill also would prohibit regulators from granting banking companies new authority to deal in securities, insurance or real estate retroactively from March 6, 1987, until March 1, 1988.    Since March, the Federal Reserve Board has given several of the nation's largest bank holding companies new securities powers, noting that the companies would have to suspend their activities if the moratorium became law. Most of those Fed orders have been stayed by a federal appeals court until the legal questions they raise have been settled.    In addition, the measure would prohibit the establishment of limited-service banks retroactively after March 5. Institutions established before that date would be barred from expanding their services and from increasing their assets by more than 7% each year, beginning 12 months after the bill becomes law.    Limited-service banks either take deposits or make commercial loans, but don't do both. They skirt the legal definition of a bank and are exempt from many of the restrictions placed on full-service banks.    The legislation would be the first banking bill to be enacted in five years.    Other major provisions of the measure would:    --Limit the amount of time financial institutions may hold a deposited check before making the funds available for withdrawal beginning Sept. 1, 1988.    --Require caps on all adjusted-rate home mortgages and home equity loans, though not specifying what that limit should be.    --Remove the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the FSLIC and the National Credit Union Administration from spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law and from the spending oversight of the White House Office of Management and Budget.    --Give the FDIC more tools with which to deal with failed and failing banks.    --Require the FDIC to pay interest on disputed certificates of deposit issued by Golden Pacific National Bank, an institution in New York's Chinatown that failed in June 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
