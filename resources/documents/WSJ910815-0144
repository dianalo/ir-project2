Under the rules, which go into effect today, thedepartment will impose strict licensing requirements for theexport of merchandise, technical data and software to certainprojects in the Middle East and other regions that U.S.authorities believe to be involved in the design,manufacture, or stockpiling of chemical and biologicalweapons or missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.</LP><TEXT>   Many U.S. exporters, however, argue that the newregulations are too sweeping because they can be applied tosuch innocuous products as word processors and mass-marketedsoftware. The rules, moreover, retain a controversialprovision that would penalize U.S. exporters if they fail toapply for a license for a shipment that they &quot;know&quot; could beused for the proscribed purposes.   But the department chose not to define &quot;know,&quot; saying thatthe exporters should be guided by &quot;existing case law andjudicial interpretation.&quot; This provision puts a major burdenon exporters to prove they acted with proper diligence indealing with the overseas projects.   Some U.S. industry groups unsuccessfully urged that theirmembers' overseas subsidiaries be exempt from the rules. Thedepartment's decision to include the overseas subsidiariescould arouse renewed criticism from European governments onthe so-called extraterritorial reach of U.S. laws.   More than 70 trade associations, firms and individuals hadfiled comments with the Commerce Department since the ruleswere first proposed in March. The department, however, heededonly a few recommendations, including a proposal that urged amore expeditious licensing process for shipments from a U.S.company to an overseas branch or affiliate. The departmentsaid it will regulate this type of shipments under a separaterule.   To the disappointment of many exporters, the departmentsaid that it won't recognize contract sanctity, except underspecial circumstances, as a reason for exempting shipmentsfrom the rules.   In response to criticism by exporters that the U.S. isacting unilaterally, a senior U.S. official said theadministration is stepping up its efforts to get otherindustrialized nations to adopt similar regulations.</TEXT></DOC>
