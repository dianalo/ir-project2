A brush fire raged within a few miles of the Idaho state Capitolin Boise but crews using air tankers and helicopters hoped to havethe fire contained by the evening.   Firefighters contained a 3,100-acre blaze in Montana and foughtsmaller fires in Oregon and Colorado.   Water lines run from Yellowstone Lake to the area around thevillage of West Thumb fed a sprinkler system that doused a mile ofthe power line, according to fire information officer Larry Blade.Crews began the watering Tuesday to keep flames from the17,360-acre Shoshone fire from scorching the cable.   Crews continued to scoop buckets of water out of Yellowstone'sLewis Lake for helicopter drops on the 18,700-acre fire dubbedNorth Fork. Fire managers are concentrating on the fire's easternedge to prevent it from threatening the area around Old Faithfulgeyser.   Firefighters also made aerial water drops on another fire in thepark, a 16,600-acre blaze dubbed the Fan Fire. And managers beganreleasing crews from the 75,000-acre Clover Mist fire Tuesday andturned the blaze back over to the National Park Service formonitoring, Blade said.   Elsewhere in Wyoming, temperatures in the 60s and light rainhelped crews fight a 1,800-acre fire in the Bighorn National Forest.   ``The rain's not putting out the fire, but it's helping thefirefighters achieve containment,'' fire information officer DaveDamron said. Officials expected to have the fire contained byThursday evening and controlled by Friday evening.   The rain also was expected to help crews contain a 1,300-acreblaze and a 70-acre fire elsewhere in the Bighorn forest byWednesday evening, Damron said.   In Idaho, a fire burned more than 2,200 acres of tinder-drycheatgrass and brush only a few miles from the Capitol in Boisebefore 120 firefighters, air tankers and helicopters reined it inabout midday. No structures were damaged.   Fire bosses hoped to contain the blaze by evening. The cause ofthe fire was still being investigated.   Rain slowed the advance of a 1,300-acre fire near the Wyomingborder. About 500 firefighters worked against the lightning-causedblaze, but the moisture prevented crews from conducting acontrolled burn of areas between established fire lines and thefire.   ``The fire has laid down,'' said Targhee National Forestspokesman John Mincks. ``The rain was a mixed blessing, though. ...It's really steep ground, and the crews are having some realproblems because it is slippery.''   Six firefighters suffered minor injuries.   In Montana, a 3,100-acre fire in the Bitterroot National Forestalong the Idaho border was contained Wednesday morning and expectedto be under control by late evening, fire information officer PeggyO'Connell said. U.S. Forest Service officials hope to beginreopening parts of the forest by the weekend, she said.   The firefighting effort cost $2.1 million and resulted in minorinjuries to 19 people, she said. Zachary Elwell, 26, of Alvarado,Texas, was charged Monday with failing to extinguish a campfire andcausing the blaze.   Two other fires totaling about 36,500 acres in Montana's BobMarshall Wilderness complex showed little activity in the cool,cloudy weather. They were being allowed to burn unchecked becausethey were in wilderness preserves.   In Oregon, winds and recently harvested timber spread a day-oldfire over more than 600 acres of rugged terrain owned byWeyerhaeuser Co. about 26 miles southeast of Coos Bay, according toDoug Decker, spokesman for the state Forestry Department. The causeof the fire was under investigation.   Over 400 firefighters fought the blaze with the help of fourwater-carrying helicopters and two airplanes that dropped fireretardant.   A field fire charred 400 acres and damaged one house and twofire trucks about 85 miles south of Portland before it wascontrolled Tuesday night.   Eighty firefighters battled a lightning-caused fire that covered300 acres of brush, grass and short timber near Fort Collins innorthern Colorado.</TEXT></DOC>
