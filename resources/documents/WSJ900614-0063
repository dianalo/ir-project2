Or whether, as thebloody events in Romania yesterday remind us, stabledemocratic governments could arise after 40 years oftotalitarian rule. With the first round of elections in thepost-Communist era just about complete, some initialobservations are possible.   East Europeans turned out at the polls in proportionslarger than voters generally do in the West. Whether theyvoted for a national consensus movement, as they did inPoland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, or for a dolled-upversion of the ruling party, as they did in Romania andapparently did in Bulgaria, the electors were intent onmaking a clear break with the past.</LP><TEXT>   Nevertheless, not one of these elections can be consideredas anything more than transitional. One reason is thatnowhere in Eastern Europe have political parties been able tosufficiently organize to represent coherent ideologies andidentifiable constituencies. Nor could most parties fieldnationally recognized candidates. Politicians with any recordin governance invariably were compromised by having beenmembers of the discredited Communist Party. This isespecially so in Romania and Bulgaria.   There was an extraordinary outburst of violence in theRomanian capital yesterday when the army fired uponanti-Communist demonstrators in a melee at the state-run TVstation. There have been nonstop protests in Bucharest fornearly three months, complaining that the National SalvationFront, which got the most votes in a recent parliamentaryelection, still is dominated by Communists.   Fears exist of similar post-election violence in Bulgaria.One of the main factors behind the Bulgarian Socialists'victory was that the ad-hoc opposition coalition failed toovercome the long-entrenched party machinery in thecountryside. They also had a strong strategy in being theones to initiate the reforms, and then calling earlyelections. That the party had Moscow's evident support was noliability in Bulgaria. Nor did it hurt that Bulgaria's brandof communism was relatively less harsh in economic terms thanin neighboring countries such as Romania. So the oppositionmay be only partially correct in ascribing the Socialistvictory to voter fear and election irregularities.   But that's no cause for discouragement. Politicalmovements that have won electoral victories elsewhere inEastern Europe -- Solidarity in Poland, the Civic Forum inCzechoslovakia and the Democratic Forum in Hungary -- are ina similarly unsettled situation. Only East Germany, whoseprospects are directly linked to German unification, is anexception. As political, economic and social questions becomeclearer, so will the positions of the various parties andcandidates on these issues. Judging from the currentpolitical battles in Poland, which led off Eastern Europe'selections last year, no candidate will be able to take votersfor granted.   It will not necessarily be a sign of failure if voters inthese countries are called back to the polls before themandates of their latest ballots expire. On the contrary. Theregimes that would cause the most worry would be the onesthat might be tempted, in the name of political stability, tomake their rule permanent.</TEXT></DOC>
