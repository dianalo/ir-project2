The opposition said the government was afraid of lowing power.Top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said Roh's directive was ``a plotschemed by fascists not to lose their invested rights.''   He said government hardliners were attempting to create a falsesense of crisis to frighten people into supporting Roh andjustifying restraints on government opponents.   Roh spoke in an unsually tough, nationally televised address. Heissued a ``special directive'' to security forces to take immediatesteps to end all violent and illegal protests by opposition andlabor groups, and he said officials who failed to enforce law andorder would be dismissed.   ``Unlawful and disorderly developments and excessive demandsgushing forth in the course of liquidating authoritarianism ... arethreatening not only democracy but also the stability of the freeeconomy,'' Roh told a meeting of key government officials.   Government leaders are concerned protests could increaseopposition to Roh because the public already is angry overcorruption and human rights abuses under former president ChunDoo-hwan. Roh is trying to block widespread demands that Chun bepunished.   Radical students and dissidents have staged a series of violentprotests in recent months to demand the overthrow of the Rohgovernment. Radicals also have staged scattered attacks ongovernment and U.S. military facilities.   The protests have been small compared to major anti-governmentprotests in 1987. But officials have expressed concern at theincreasing use of violence by radicals.   Roh said the radicals' use of firebombs and homemade explosivesin protests have ``reached a serious phase.'' No deaths and just afew serious injuries have been reported in recent protests.   The president also expressed concern about frequent violentstrikes and warned that labor unrest was a threat to economicstability. He said the government will still support peaceful andlegal trade union activity, but he said violence and excessive uniondemands will not be tolerated.   Roh said South Korea was well on the way to democracy and thatviolent extremists would not be allowed to pose a threat to nationalstability or the desire of the great majority of Koreans for orderlychange.   ``Law and order will be thoroughly established,'' he said.   Roh has promised to hold a referendum on his rule next year, andgovernment leaders fear the controversy surrounding Chun coulddamage his chances of winning. Roh, a former ally of Chun, isidentified with his predecessor in the eyes of some Koreans.   The president reportedly also is under pressure from governmenthardliners unhappy about political protests and growth of oppositionand leftist groups.   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in1980, went into rural exile last month after apologizing for abusesunder his rule.   Roh, also a former general, won presidential elections inDecember 1987. He has dismantled most of the authoritarian controlsimposed by Chun.</TEXT></DOC>
