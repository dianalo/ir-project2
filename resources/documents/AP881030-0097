(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After losing ground to its neighbors,Louisville is finally shaking off the lingering effects of the lastrecession with the help of public and private investment.   A recent survey of Louisville and 14 comparison cities showsthat, for the first half of this year, the Louisville area hasgenerated more high-paying jobs than other regional competitors.   The list includes Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Nashville, Tenn.,Richmond, Va., and Kansas City, Mo.   ``Coming out of the recession, Louisville's growth was quitesmall relative to the other cities,'' said Paul Cooms, an economistwith the Bureau of Economic Research at the University ofLouisville, which conducted the survey.   Indianapolis, for example, enjoyed a rapid renaissance as newhotels, skyscrapers and athletic facilities, such as the HoosierDome, gave the city a new vigor.   Louisville, on the other hand, had a tough time overcoming theclosed factories and lost jobs following the recessions.   ``But in the last two to three years, Louisville has finallyrecovered strongly,'' Cooms said. ``Louisville is a good market,and people know it.''   ``I don't know how much you want to make out of two quarters ofdata, but certainly we've recovered well,'' Cooms said.   Civic leaders agree. The most recent tangible evidence that thecity is on the move, they say, was Saturday's dedication of the newnational headquarters of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).   Louisville won the headquarters at the church's 1987 assembly inBiloxi, Miss., by scoring a convention-floor upset over KansasCity, which had been recommended by the church's site selectioncommittee.   Louisville had been ruled out as a site until a localbusinessman offered to donate two turn-of-the-century warehousesworth $1 million on the city's waterfront. Community pledges of $7million more were made to renovate the buildings, and the cityoffered a parking garage and rebuilt streets.   In addition, major banks offered a $25 million revolving loanfund at favorable rates.   Mayor Jerry Abramson said persuading the Presbyterians to cometo Louisville showed ``people in this community that when we worktogether in a cooperative way we can compete with anybody at anylevel.''   That is the idea behind the Campaign for Greater Louisville _ alargely business-backed organization that has raised more than $10million, and plans to strengthen and expand existing businesses, tocreate new local businesses and to attract outside business to thearea.   The campaign's first expenditure two months ago went toward theproposed $300 million expansion of Louisville's Standiford Field.Two new, parallel runways are to be built, displacing thousands ofresidents, as well as businesses and churches.   ``I can't think of a more important economic-development stepthis campaign can take at this point in time,'' campaign chairmanGeorge N. Gill, president and publisher of the LouisvilleCourier-Journal, said then.   Abramson, who is also pushing the airport expansion, believesanother key to continued downtown development _ despite stiffcompetition from the suburbs and a stagnant population _ rests withproviding incentives to counter a loss of federal aid.   Local government, with the help of federal dollars, investedheavily in downtown from 1970 to the early 1980s. Now that federalsupport has dropped off, local government is concentrating onprojects that support economic development and make downtown moreattractive.   And civic leaders have returned to the city's oldest andgreatest asset _ the Ohio River _ as the major source of downtownrevitalization.   ``Administrations before me studied it and studied it. What wedecided to do was take some risks and start to develop thewaterfront,'' Abramson said.   Now, hundreds of millions of dollars in new and plannedconstruction are taking place within blocks of the river's edge.   But Cooms said Louisville's continued growth is conditional uponthe U.S. economy's continuing to expand and favorable exchange andinterest rates.   ``The average life of an economic recovery is only about fouryears, and we're now finishing the sixth year, so it should makesome people nervous,'' Cooms said.   One national survey said the population of the metropolitan areahas declined from about 970,000 on Jan. 1, 1987, to about 966,000on Jan. 1 of this year causing the area to slip from 48th to 50thplace as a national market.   That may not bode well for the city's ability to attract largecompanies and national advertising dollars, particularly if theslide continues because many decisions are made on the basis of ametropolitan area's ranking in the nation's top 50 markets.</TEXT></DOC>
