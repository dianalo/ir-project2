Congress waved its wand and declared that by 1977 air pollution would be eliminated from all U.S. cities. Congress has twice rolled back the deadline for this miraculous event. But it has refused to either reconsider the act's goals in light of recent scientific research or make needed adjustments in the act. Instead, Congress has dumped the mess on the Environmental Protection Agency.    This week, EPA proposed delaying enforcement of federal smog and carbon-monoxide standards for up to eight years. Some 50 urban areas, which face EPA-imposed construction bans in January if they fail to meet federal standards, will now have to submit new plans for complying with them. It was the most reasonable response that could be made in light of the Clean Air Act. Capitol Hill, of course, is bellowing.    &quot;With this policy, the Environmental Protection Agency steps outside the law,&quot; said Senator George Mitchell. &quot;Only Congress has the authority to extend deadlines,&quot; announced Senator Robert Stafford. &quot;What EPA is proposing to do is contrary to the law,&quot; said Rep. Henry Waxman.&quot; It might have been better in the long run had EPA actually imposed nonsensical draconian curbs on economic activity. Then a Congress besieged by outraged constituents might have made the effort to write much-needed cost-benefit analysis into the act.    &quot;We now know two things we didn't really know in 1970,&quot; says Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution. &quot;One, is that photochemical smog doesn't inflict the degree of damage on people that many feared, and that the costs of reducing that damage to near zero everywhere are simply enormous.&quot;    The specific air-quality standards set by the EPA are often a poor guide to controlling pollution. The major study the EPA used to set the standard for smog involved six adults exercising under different ozone levels. Although the study showed no significant evidence of reduced lung function below 0.30 parts of ozone per million, the EPA standard is set at 0.12 parts per million.    Environmental groups unhappy with the EPA delay don't acknowledge that many of them supported what they knew to be clearly unrealistic compliance deadlines, because those deadlines kept alive opportunities to push their legislative agenda in Congress. Last month, the Senate Environment Committee approved a bill stretching out the deadlines for smog cleanup, but at the price of including an expensive program to control acid rain and toxic air pollutants.    Ironically, many state and local officials issue calls for tough federal pollution standards. &quot;Many of them want tough symbolic federal standards and lax enforcement to deflect political heat,&quot; says Mr. Crandall. &quot;That way when environmentalists or business complains to them they can always blame Washington and duck the responsibility.&quot;    The General Accounting Office has consistently criticized the EPA's air-monitoring network. Moreover, there is no reliable method of determining the overall air quality in a given region; the GAO concludes that Washington simply doesn't know with any degree of accuracy whether the air is getting cleaner or dirtier.    What this level of uncertainty tells us is that state and local officials should be responsible for deciding how best to measure local air pollution and should make the inevitable trade-offs between economic growth and environmental quality.    Federal environmental regulation has been premised on a belief that smog problems -- largely caused by automobiles -- should be dealt with on a collective basis, instead of by making individuals directly face the cost of their actions. &quot;Environmentalists seem to say, people don't pollute, cars do. So let's put emission controls on cars, but not charge people for how much they drive during smog alerts,&quot; says Fred Smith, a former EPA analyst who is now president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington.    Congress has saddled EPA with a monumental task in establishing sensible clean-air guidelines for all the country's cities. Mr. Smith says that attempting to set thousands of air-pollution standards is a task &quot;equivalent to that of central planning in the Soviet Union.&quot;    But few politicians are willing to challenge the command-and-control approach to air pollution established long ago in the heady atmosphere of Earth Day. Until Congress recognizes that its obsession with near-zero air pollution levels has a near-zero chance of succeeding, the pass-the-buck games being played by government at all levels will continue. </TEXT></DOC>
