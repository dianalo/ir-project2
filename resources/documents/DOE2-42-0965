In the processes of fabrication and demonstration of reliability,in turn, a central role is played by adequate development and qualificationtests. To provide these vital services, a number of experimental centershave been established in Italy, equipped with the necessary capabilitiesand facilities. These resources are made available to the Italian industryand institutions as well as to foreign organizations and companies, alsowithin the framework of international agreements. The paper presentsthe major experimental centers existing in Italy, namely: the centersof ENEA-CASACCIA, SIET, ANSALDO-BOSCHETTO, FIAT-CIEI, CESI, CISE andISMES and reviews the experience, the test facilities and most significantactivities in progress.</TEXT></DOC>
