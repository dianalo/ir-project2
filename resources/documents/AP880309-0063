DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two native sons, Gov. Michael Dukakis and VicePresident George Bush, scored convincing wins in the Massachusettsprimary. Jesse Jackson in the Democratic race and Sen. Bob Dole inthe GOP contest finished far behind.   The win at home and victories in Florida and Texas gave Dukakisthe three biggest Super Tuesday prizes. The Bush victory inMassachusetts, where he was born, was part of a Super Tuesdaylandslide.   With 1,925 of 2,140 precincts, or 90 percent, reporting, Dukakisled with 367,637 votes, or 59 percent, followed by Jackson with117,408 votes, or 19 percent.   With 1,924 of the 2,140 precincts, or 90 percent, reporting,Bush had 127,918 votes, or 59 percent. Dole had 57,426 or 26percent.   Dukakis, the popular governor of this liberal state, was aprohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary, where 98 delegateswere at stake, the party's third-biggest prize of the day. Itappeared Dukakis would get 79 of the delegates and Jackson theremaining 19.   ``This augurs very well for the future,'' said Dukakis in atelevision interview from Chicago.   But he denied the Super Tuesday results would secure theDemocratic nomination for him.   Dukakis had not campaigned in Massachusetts until last week,when he took to the streets of Cambridge for about an hour ofstumping. None of his rivals bothered to spend time or money here.   In the Republican primary, 52 delegates were at stake, thefourth-biggest batch on Super Tuesday.   Bush established a wide early lead in the tiny MassachusettsRepublican party and held off Dole, who did not campaign here. Bushwon the 1980 GOP primary here, defeating Ronald Reagan.   Well behind Bush and Dole were Rep. Jack Kemp, who had 15,134votes, or 7 percent, and Pat Robertson, who received 9,963 votes,or 5 percent.   Analyzing Bush's victory, Gordon Nelson, state co-chair forKemp's campaign, said the vice president convinced voters he wasPresident Reagan's logical successor: ``George Bush won because heis Reagan II.''   In third place among the Democrats was Missouri Rep. RichardGephardt with 63,865 votes, or 10 percent, followed by TennesseeSen. Albert Gore Jr. with 28,135 votes, or 4 percent, and IllinoisSen. Paul Simon with 22,692 votes, or 4 percent.   Gary Hart, who won the 1984 Massachusetts Democratic primary,trailed the field of active candidates with 9,955 votes, or 2percent.</TEXT></DOC>
