Khashoggi, a jet-setting financier known for his big deals andan alleged central role in the Iran-Contra affair, faces chargesstemming from ``illegal property dealings,'' a Justice Ministrystatement said.   The Marcoses fled the Philippines in February 1986 after themilitary-civilian uprising that deposed Marcos and broughtPresident Corazon Aquino to power. They are accused of taking anestimated $3.5 billion in cash and property.   The U.S. government has accused Khashoggi of fronting for Marcosto help divert and hide the former president's ownership of realestate and valuable art.   Khashoggi, 54, was arrested in a Bern hotel this morning and wastaken to the district jail in downtown Bern, the ministry statementsaid.   It was not immediately known why he was in Bern but he isreported to hold interests in several European companies. Hisoffice in Saudi Arabia declined immediate comment on the arrest andreferred inquiries to Khashoggi's lawyer, identified as Sami Fadel,whose whereabouts were not disclosed.   U.S. indictments naming the Marcoses, Khashoggi, five otherpeople and a California bank accuse the couple of plundering morethan $100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy real estateand expensive art objects in New York.   Khashoggi, the reputed broker of the arms deal at the heart ofthe Iran-Contra scandal, was indicted in October in New York onracketeering and other charges in the case.   Khashoggi, who has lived in Paris, is accused of submitting afalse document to French officials who were seeking evidence at therequest of U.S. investigators.   He also posed as the owner of paintings and New York propertysecretly held by the Marcoses, prosecutors have said.   Specifically, he is charged with racketeering, obstruction ofjustice and mail fraud. Conviction of the charges would carrypenalities ranging from five to 20 years in prison.   The Philippines claims that after the Marcoses went into exilein Hawaii, their agents and Khashoggi carted away 25 paintings fromNew York properties owned by the Marcoses. The action allegedlycame after a California federal judge ordered that none of theMarcoses' property could be moved.   Khashoggi allegedly sold 12 paintings for $3.2 million.   The Swiss Justice Ministry statement said a warrant forKhashoggi's arrest was issued March 24.   Under the terms of a U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty, U.S.authorities will have to formally request Khashoggi's extraditionwithin the next 60 days.   Khashoggi has 10 days to file an appeal and request his release,the announcement said. The Federal Tribunal, Switzerland's supremecourt, would have the final say if he fights an extradition order.   Khashoggi, born in Mecca as the oldest son of the personalphysician of the late King Ibn Saud, has been in the headlines fordecades.   Known for his flamboyant lifestyle and negotiating talents,Khashoggi figured in several kickback scandals with U.S. aircraftmanufacturers paying him large amounts for arranging multi-billiondollar defense contracts.   He was also involved in the Iran-Contra affair in which proceedsfrom sales of U.S. arms to Iran allegedly were funneled toU.S.-backed rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist government.   At one time, published reports estimated his personal wealth atup to $4 billion. But declining oil prices and stricter control ofarms dealings were said to reduced his fortune.   Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent to the charges contained in theU.S. indictment. Marcos has said he is too ill to appear in NewYork for legal proceedings.</TEXT></DOC>
