Flood waters were receding early today in most areas drenched bythe 24-hour deluge. A 70 percent chance of thunderstorms wasforecast for today, but the National Weather Service didn't issueflood warnings.   As much as 16 inches of rain fell in Jefferson Parish, next toNew Orleans, from Monday night through Tuesday, said Civil DefenseDirector Robert Lyons. Ten inches was measured at New OrleansInternational Airport.   ``If it rains long enough and hard enough, as the Bible tells us,everybody is susceptible to flooding,'' said Jefferson ParishPresident Mike Yenni.   The weather service said 7 inches of rain fell on Baton Rouge, 75miles to the north, but dry ground quickly absorbed much of thewater.   The downpour overcame efforts to use huge pumps in Orleans andJefferson parishs to suck water out of the bowl-shaped area and intoLake Pontchartrain.   ``You can't prepare for the amounts of water we had,'' Yennisaid. ``We're still trying to prepare for 5 inches of rain in fivehours. We had one drainage station measure 10 inches.''   Two-year-old Brian Serrano of Metairie wandered out of his houseand either fell or jumped into a drainage canal, said sheriff's Lt.Bob Garner. He was swept more than a mile to a pumping station,where two workers in a rowboat pulled his body from the water.   Lightning knocked out transformers and switches, blacking out11,000 customers in the New Orleans area, utility officials said.Most of the electricity was restored.   Many students were kept at schools into the night because oftraffic snarls and the dangers of travel.   At least 150 homes in Orleans, Jefferson and St. Bernard parisheswere flooded, an experience most owners in low-lying Louisiana hadbeen through before.   ``I lost everything _ all my Christmas presents that I hadpurchased so far. The bedding's gone. Clothes are gone. I have onepair of shoes left that were sitting in the van two streets downthat I took off on the way home from work,'' said Christina Flemingof Avondale.</TEXT></DOC>
