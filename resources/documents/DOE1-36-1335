The direct reasons for introducing this system lie in reductionin the energy cost and the facility expenditure, and energy supply diversificationfor avoiding the shortage. From the economical viewpoint, effective utilizationof waste-heat is the most important factor. For example, by supplyingelectric and thermal energy through a gas engine and a gas turbine, thepower consumption and the auxiliary heating gas amount can be reduced.In general hotels and hospitals, by supplying 30 - 4% of the power capacityof the buildings through the cogeneration, an efficient system can beobtained, due to the most effective utilization of the waste-heat fromthe gas engines. As for the spread of the cogeneration system at theend of March, 1987, 87 gas engine generators, 12 gas turbine generators,41 gas engine refrigerators/pressure feeders, and 113 gas engine heatpumps enter into a contract.
