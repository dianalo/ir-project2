The main goal, in terms of PV installed power, is to reachat least 1,500 kW by the end of 1988. Demonstration applications andrural electrification will be promoted. The role of the EC is expectedto become very important. The PV homologation lab of the IER will guaranteethe quality of the modules to be sold in Spain. In thin film cell amorphoussilicon alloys, a complete research program including collaboration fromuniversities and other research centers, and partly integrated withinthe EC program, has been established by the IER. Copper indium diselenide,gallium arsenide and photoelectrochemical cells are also studied as alternativeconcepts. Finally, system research is intended to identify improvementsin modules and subsystems' performance, both individually and as a partof a complete photovoltaic system. 2 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
