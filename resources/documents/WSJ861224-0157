A handful of short, gray, middle-aged Frenchmen pose like the U.S. Marines in the photograph at Iwo Jima, straining to raise the tricolor. The handsome endpapers show France's present and former overseas territories and departments on a beautiful map of the world. The disappointing part of the book is between the covers.    Mr. Rosenblum, a senior foreign correspondent for the Associated Press, hints at some promising themes, including modern French diplomacy, France's status as a &quot;cultural superpower,&quot; and its aggressive defense of French cultural values. Four chapters at the beginning of the book and four chapters at the end offer thoughts on these topics, combined with a kind of travelogue of modern French influence in Corsica or Reunion or Guadeloupe.    Sandwiched in between is the indigestible filling that sinks &quot;Mission to Civilize&quot; under its own weight: a 270-page synopsis of French foreign relations, from the Gallic Wars to last year's Greenpeace affair, all drawn from standard historical works and recent newspaper accounts. With rare exceptions -- a snatch of an interview, a recollection of something observed on assignment -- Mr. Rosenblum adds nothing of his own. The judgments that occasionally interrupt the dogged narrative are all quoted from others. The result is like an undergraduate term paper gone wild, a stultifying paraphrase of other people's history books and reporting.    French history from Vercingetorix to de Gaulle occupies 140 pages, moving briskly through the centuries. &quot;And in 1066, William the Bastard crossed the English Channel and stamped himself into history as William the Conqueror.&quot; &quot;Crippled by the One Hundred Years' War, France floundered on.&quot; &quot;For Fernand Braudel, French grandeur ended in 1763.&quot; &quot;Enter Napoleon.&quot; Nearly as much space is devoted to selected topics in the events of the past 20 years -- France in Africa, France in the Middle East, North African immigrants in France -- but even on these more accessible subjects Mr. Rosenblum offers little more than a precis of his files.    For example, the Abu Daoud case, in which the French flouted law and diplomacy in their haste to get a notorious terrorist safely out of the country, would seem to be tailor-made for anyone who wants to analyze the &quot;cynical&quot; French view of national self-interest, particularly in light of later developments. Mr. Rosenblum merely strings together a series of one-sentence quotations to tell what the New York Times, the Washington Post and Bild Zeitung had to say about it. Everyone in Paris has his own ideas about the crisis in New Caledonia and the Greenpeace affair, but a 40-page chapter on these juicy topics appears to have been composed by placing news clippings squarely next to the typewriter, then summarizing each day's articles in chronological sequence.    Where are the ideas that persuaded anyone there was a book here? Mr. Rosenblum is interested in style as a substitute for substance in foreign relations: He advances the appealing suggestion that a &quot;subtly structured empire,&quot; based &quot;firmly and squarely on illusion,&quot; maintains France as a world power.    Mr. Rosenblum seems to be saying that the French, who send &quot;foreign aid shipments of civilization&quot; where others can offer only food or weapons, manage to intimidate other nations with their cultural superiority; and that France, by acting the part of a great power, tends to get away with it. But cultural intimidation, devastating on a social level, may not get you far in foreign relations. Libya has been restrained in Chad by French Jaguars, not by French hauteur, and while the French have been serenely unapologetic about blowing up the Rainbow Warrior, their unruffled air hasn't spared them from being exposed in that episode as blunderers, killers and liars.    With apologies to Mr. Rosenblum, I think he is more exercised by the way the French can assume an attitude of superiority than by any evidence such an attitude shapes policy or produces political benefits. The French tend to have firm views on what they want, on how things should be done and on how people in a given situation should behave. You may find this refreshing or you may -- like Mr. Rosenblum -- find it &quot;judgmental.&quot;    In the latter case you, too, may be intimidated, as Mr. Rosenblum so often seems to be when he meets French-speaking people. A lovely blonde receptionist in Reunion &quot;deduced instantly that I had nothing to offer that she might want.&quot; An eminent guest at a dinner party &quot;fixed me with that gaze meant for children, morons, and Anglo-Saxon moralizers.&quot; A young Gabonese cabinet minister &quot;looked at me, surprised, as though I were a little slow.&quot;    Come on Mr. Rosenblum. If you're going to deal with the French, you've got to get that chip off your shoulder!    ---   Mr. Kull is a New York lawyer and former Parisian. </TEXT></DOC>
