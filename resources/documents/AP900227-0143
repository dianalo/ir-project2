Morgan was jailed in 1987 for more than two years for failing toreveal the whereabouts of her daughter, Hilary, now 7.   Her passport request was taken under advisement by District ofColumbia Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon following a 90 minutehearing.   ``Keeping Elizabeth Morgan a prisoner in her own country won'tbe any more effective than keeping her a prisoner in that littlecell,'' said her attorney, Steven Sachs.   Sachs argued that Morgan has fulfilled ``every obligation''since her passport was turned over to court authorities in 1987.``It is being unlawfully and illegally held,'' he said.   However, John Lenahan, representing Morgan's former husband andthe girl's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, argued that returning thepassport would only give Morgan ``an opportunity to further defy''the previous contempt of court order.   ``She has done nothing to purge herself of the contemptcharge,'' Lenahan said.   Morgan was jailed in 1987 for 25 months for refusing to turnover the girl for supervised visits with Foretich. Morgan hascontended the girl was sexually abused by Foretich. He has deniedthe charges and claimed that Morgan was mentally ill.   Foretich and his wife separated before Hilary was born.   The girl, who has been living with her maternal grandparents inChristchurch, New Zealand, had been the subject of a 2{-year searchby her father. Officials found her there last week.</TEXT></DOC>
