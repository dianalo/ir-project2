Short interest among the largest OTC stocks fell back 2.3%for the month through mid-December, and the level amongsmaller issues fell 5.4%. Combined short interest for largeand small OTC issues was nearly 329 million shares, down fromthe record volume of 342.5 million originally reported forthe prior month.</LP><TEXT>   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, bettingthat the stock's price will decline and that they can buy theshares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet beenpurchased for return to lenders.   First Executive Corp. led the list of companies showingshort interest, with nearly 5.8 million shares. But shortinterest in the insurance company's shares actually declined5% from November. First Executive invested heavily in junkbonds over several years, and has been struggling with a weakportfolio.   Significant increases in short positions occurred inseveral computer and technology issues -- Oracle SystemsCorp., Adobe Systems Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. Shortinterest in Apple shares had doubled in the mid-Novembermonth, as investors feared a bad earnings report. But morerecently the stock had rebounded; the past month's increasesuggests further betting on another slide in the shares.Semiconductor and disk-drive issues generally have been underselling pressure.   The biggest single volume increase was in MedcoContainment Services Inc., a provider of prescription-by-mailservices for pharmaceuticals. It saw short interest climb to2.3 million shares from 1.2 million the month earlier. Also,New England Critical Care Inc.'s short interest rose to 1.4million shares from 834,000 a month earlier. The companyprovides home-based therapy services.   Some stock fund managers have been trimming theirportfolios of health-care stocks, but they still see thesekinds of companies as a relative haven in hard economictimes.   Among issues with decreasing short interest volumes, MCICommunications Corp. led with an 875,000-share drop to atotal of 1.3 million. The company's stock has fallensubstantially in recent months, and analysts see somebottoming-out of the decline.   Although a substantial short position reflects heavyspeculation that a stock's price will decline, some investorsconsider an increase in short interest bullish because theborrowed shares eventually must be bought back.   And some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on thestock at all but shows up as part of another strategy, suchas arbitrage or dividend capture.   The National Association of Securities Dealers, theself-regulatory agency that operates the Nasdaq computerizedsystem on which more than 4,300 OTC issues trade, compilesshort interest data in two categories: the approximatelytwo-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that tradeon the National Market System; and the other, generallysmaller stocks that don't.   The NASD reported that short interest in 2,258 NationalMarket System issues, the largest OTC stocks, totaled 292.6million shares at mid-December, down from a revised 299.4million in mid-November among 2,267 shares.   Short interest in 1,181 smaller securities traded onNasdaq declined to 36.3 million shares for December from arevised 38.3 million for November among 1,197 issues.   The National Market System's short-interest ratio atmid-December fell to 3.12 from 3.29 a month earlier, whilethe short-interest ratio for other OTC issues declined to1.29 from 1.51 a month earlier.   The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market'saverage daily trading volume that would be required toconvert the total short interest position -- is a measure ofnegative trader sentiment. Some analysts suggest, however,that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator becauseoptions and other products can be used to hedge shortpositions.</TEXT></DOC>
