Yeh Chang-ti and Chang Li-yi were greeted at the airport bytheir families and former colleagues. ``It's nice to be homeagain,'' said Yeh.   Yeh and Chang, both in their early 60s, have told reporters theywished to regain their status as majors in the air force to servethe country.   Defense Minister Chen Li-an said Tuesday the two men's militarystatus could not be restored because of their age. Chen said,however, his ministry would provide necessary compensation for Yehand Chang.   Military officials said they welcomed the pilots' return.   Both Yeh and Chang were members of the ``Black Cat'' squadron, asecret unit of Taiwan's air force formed in 1961 by selected combatpilots. The now defunct squadron's missions were to fly U.S.-madeLockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over China to gather militaryinformation for the Central Intelligence Agency and the Nationalistgovernment in Taiwan.   The Nationalists, driven to Taiwan in 1949 by Communist forcesin China, had vowed to rule mainland China again. The United Statesswitched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.   Yeh was shot down in 1963 while flying over Jiangxi province ineastern China, and Chang was downed in 1965 on a special researchflight over northern China.   They were captured and sentenced to forced labor, but werereleased from China in 1983. However, their request to return homewas rejected as Taiwan authorities regarded the release as aChinese propaganda move.   The two then stayed in the United States with the help of theCIA. Yeh is a resident of Houston, and Chang lives in Washington.   Four Nationalist pilots were killed during spy missions overChina and six others died in accidents during training in theUnited States before authorities disbanded the squadron in 1974.</TEXT></DOC>
