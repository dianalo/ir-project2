The oat cereal experience illustrates the point, with dozens ofproducts appearing magically after consumers indicated that if oatswere nutritionally good for horses they were good for humans too.   But in two of the most important areas of society the systemseems to have failed. It hasn't been able to market a trulylow-cost house, and it hasn't been able to present a widelyaffordable health-care package.   Both houses and health care continue to rise in price, with eachat one time or another spurting far beyond the level of generalprice inflation. Each has unique impediments. Neither seems able tobenefit from volume production.   In housing, it is possible to build a house at an affordableprice. Putting it on a piece of property is another matter, plaguedby high land costs and a bureaucracy of zoning, environmental,health and building officials.   Builders, the trades and engineers probably have done as much asthey can.   Forty years ago the typical price of a new single-family homewas $9,500, with labor and materials accounting for nearly 70percent of price.   By 1969 the sale price was $26,000, and labor and materials weredown to 55 percent of that. In 1989, the typical price had soaredto $112,500, but labor and materials were down to 47 percent.   Meanwhile, the percentage of price accounted for by the finishedlot had risen steadily, to 21 percent in 1969 from 11 percent in1949. Intensive use of lots, as in cluster housing, then restrainedthe percentage, but it reached 27 percent last year.   Still another factor has added to the problem. High interestrates have eliminated from the market many would-be buyers. Ratesare falling again, but with debts overhanding the economy there isno assurance they won't rise again.   Controlling health care costs runs into even more formidablebarriers, the most unmanageable of them involving the question: Howdo you restrain spending when human lives are at stake, or moresimply, what price human life?   The other problems are barely less awesome.   Research saves lives, but it cannot be put on an assembly line.The design and development of medical technology makes morediagnostic machinery available each year, but at a huge cost.Staffs no longer are willing to work for minimal wages. Thepopulation is aging. New diseases, such as AIDS, make anappearance. And insurance and litigation costs have become a newand heavy cross to bare.   If current cost trends continue, says the Conference Boardbusiness research group, medical costs could rise to $1.5 trillionby the year 2000, compared with $600 billion in 1989.   Wendy Gray, employee benefits specialist for the ConferenceBoard, states that projections for the year 2005 ``suggests thatthe Federal budget for Medicare will be greater than for SocialSecurity or defense.''   The consequences are almost beyond comprehension.   So threatening are these consequences that government has beenunable to deal with them. Business is so appalled that it isattempting to cut benefits paid to employees, while employees aretrying seeking more from business.   Perhaps you have wondered how the so-called peace dividend,expected to follow a cooling of the arms race, might be spent.   Wonder no more. If projections are correct, rising medical costswould devour it in a few months.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wednesday, Dec. 5.</NOTE></DOC>
