The official news agency said the Presidium, or executivecommittee, of Azerbaijan's parliament met Tuesday night anddeclared ``null and void'' the declaration of secession that theNagorno-Karabakh legislature passed Tuesday.   Three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's 160,000 residents areethnic Armenians but the enclave was made part of Azerbaijan in1923. The argument over it became public in February and the twoneighboring Caucasus republics have been disrupted by riots,strikes and huge demonstrations.   Tass quoted the Azerbaijan Presidium's resolution as saying theterritory's legislature ``failed to secure strict compliance withprinciples of legality'' and ``openly encroached on thenational-state composition of the republic.''   It said only 101 of the 150 legislators were present whensecession was voted. Reporters for the radio station in theterritorial capital, Stepanakert, said Tuesday the vote wasunanimous except for one abstention.   Vladimir V. Vaselenko, prosecutor of Nagorno-Karabakh, said inan interview broadcast by Soviet television Wednesday that thelegislature's action violated the constitutions and laws ofAzerbaijan and the entire nation. He said one deputy who spoke atTuesday's session admitted that, but then voted for secession.   The Soviet evening television news program ``Vremya'' reportedWednesday that militiamen in Nagorno-Karabakh had confiscatedgrenades, pistols, revolvers, sawed-off shotguns and ammunitionfrom residents in the past month.   The declaration of secession, challenging central authority allthe way up to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, was the firstsuch action in the Soviet Union's 70 years.   Armenians, most of whom are Christians, consider the mountainenclave part of their ancestral homeland. Azerbaijan ispredominantly Moslem.   Legislators of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is slightly smaller thanDelaware, said in their declaration Tuesday it was being renamedthe Artsakh Autonomous Region of Armenia.   It also called for an end to strikes, but Tass said theypersisted Wednesday in Stepanakert.   ``All industrial enterprises ... remained idle on July 13,public and city transport did not function, all shops sellingmanufactured goods were closed, so were consumer service outlets,''the agency said.   A worker at the Stepanakert radio station said in a telephoneinterview: ``The food situation has become very critical. We areproducing our own bread and milk, but other foodstuffs are lacking.Nothing is coming to us from Azerbaijan.''   He said, speaking on condition of anonymity, that soldiers werein the city streets and in other parts of Nagorno-Karabakh.   In Yerevan, capital of Armenia, 120,000 people rallied to demandthe central government in Moscow approve the transfer ofNagorno-Karabakh to Armenia, a reporter for the republic's officialnews agency said. He said a general strike continued and quotedspeakers at a rally as saying: ``We have no other means of protestthan strikes.''   The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh has brought it into directconfrontation with central authorities in Moscow as well as withAzerbaijan.   In February, the dispute led to riots in the Sumgait,Azerbaijan, in which at least 32 people were reported killed, 26 ofthem ethnic Armenians.   The Soviet constitution gives citizens the right ofself-determination, but requires a republic's consent for anychanges in its boundaries.   On Feb. 20, Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature asked the Azerbaijaniand Armenian governments to approve transfer of the region toArmenia. The Armenian legislature agreed June 15 but Azerbaijansaid no two days later.   In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, a reporter for therepublic's official news agency said the dispute was being resolvedin accordance with Gorbachev's policies of ``glasnost,'' oropenness.   ``It's being decided in a democratic way. Some people say onething; others say something else,'' the reporter said in atelephone interview, on condition his name not be used.   Gorbachev has said more attention should be paid to concerns ofthe Soviet Union's more than 100 national groups, but that some areabusing glasnost.</TEXT></DOC>
