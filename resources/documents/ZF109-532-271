 We're in the integration phase that will go through 1992.andP;  I'm talkingabout vertical integration from the field components up to headquarters --functionally, technically and from a data standpoint -- and laterally acrossall the headquarters components.andM;GCN: What is the status of the integration?andM;BAYSE: We have the Field Office Information Management System or FOIMS, whichcuts across field divisions.andP;  That's an integrated system that ismultifunctional and has files linked logically into an overall database.andP;  Itruns up to 300,000 transactions a day against 23 million records.andP;  By 1995,we will see about 5 billion transactions a year in FOIMS.andM;FOIMS is up and running well.andP;  The next thing is to integrate within FOIMS afull-blown intelligent case management capability, what we call the GenericCase Management System.andM;The agents out there work cases.andP;  There are tens of thousands ofinvestigative matters open at any time, from preliminary investigations to afull-blown major case like the savings and loans.andP;  We need a generalizedcapability that can be customized dynamically to assist the agents in casemanagement.andM;The top priority in the Criminal Investigative Division is to get betterintelligence at the program level on organized crime, terrorism and so forth.andM;We will make the intelligence applications components of FOIMS.andP;  There is aninteresting security issue here.andP;  We have criminal intelligence and thenwe've got this very sensitive information in counterintelligence.andM;The security issue is to keep those separate.andP;  We're working with theNational Security Agency, the National Computer Security Center and ourinternal experts in computer security.andM;The field commanders want to go to FOIMS and get their intelligence data,manage their cases, get evidentiary materials, and accomplish administrativeand financial management.andM;The hardest part is cross-walking that intelligence.andP;  We have to convince ourcounterespionage people that we can do it with integrity.andP;  Otherwise, we'llhave a separate but interoperable type of arrangement.andM;GCN: Are artificial intelligence applications your big push in that area?andM;BAYSE: AI is a big push.andP;  There are some other areas in artificialintelligence -- neural system, expert systems and statistical patternrecognition.andM;We're applying neural systems right now in a classified application, butultimately they will be used in other areas such as character recognition andprobably in the intelligence area to spot warnings and trends.andM;The nice thing about neural systems, of course, is that you don't have toprogram them.andM;There are a number of things we could use them for.andP;  But our mainstream AIapplication is knowledge-based expert systems.andP;  One of the strengths we haveis our experts, the agents.andM;One of the most sophisticated applications of AI right now isn't in the AIprogram per se, it's in computer security.andM;The Intrusion Detection Expert System will be applied to the National CrimeInformation Center 2000.andP;  It is now within FOIMS and will work in the FOIMSmainframe environment.andM;We'll be monitoring transactions on the system, looking for anomalies.andP;  Someof the anomalies may just be inefficiencies.andP;  Some of them will beinappropriate behavior.andP;  This is a threat-driven technology.andP;  We're lookingto find things going on in the system that are inappropriate for whateverreason.andM;GCN: How do you deal with declining information system budgets?andM;BAYSE: The strategy is multifold.andP;  One is to concentrate on the high-priorityitems.andP;  Some of those priorities are set above the division level.andM;The other is to complete the hardcore portion of our automation strategy,having intelligent workstations available to the users, and then to puttogether our distributed architecture.andM;We can work with growing resources and we can work with static or dimishingresources.andP;  It is a matter of where our priorities are.andP;  The emphasis rightnow is in the field part of the strategy, but in this headquarters there ispressure for office automation, desktop computing and executive supportsystems.andM;What we want to do is influence the bureau's ability to perform its missionin a favorable way through technology.andP;  In a discernible way, too -- not justbehind-the-scenes automation in the back room.andM;GCN: If you set priorities, that necessarily means other programs are goingto suffer.andM;BAYSE: That's right.andP;  What we will do is extend the life cycle of certainsystems.andP;  We will combine some applications, take a little more technicalrisk in certain areas, so that we can develop things a little lessexpensively.andM;Some things just won't happen.andP;  They will be proposed and will go up to myimmediate superior, the associate deputy director for administration, and hewill have to make a choice.andM;GCN: What programs will lose substantial funding?andM;BAYSE: Artificial intelligence funding is being reduced.andP;  That is one of theprograms we slowed down within the division.andM;One of the reasons is that, during our initial research in AI, we developedsome generalized capabilities like link analysis and organizational structureanalysis for organized crime that we can apply to counternarcotics andcounterterrorism.andM;Because our initial research has paid off in good benefits, we've been ableto adapt some of it to other programs.andM;By December, we'll have the first hybrid system that I know of that willunderstand two domains.andP;  In the Big Floyd system, we've essentiallyintegrated organized crime and narcotics in one expert system and relationaldata-base.andM;GCN: What is your strategy for outfitting agents with microcomputers?andM;BAYSE: Our original strategy, 10 years ago, was to have one computer forevery two agents in a squad.andP;  The theory then was that there would be enoughtime on the street for these guys that they could share computers.andP;  It wasalso a prudent approach to asking for resources in an absence of empiricaldata -- nobody had done this before.andM;We now see each agent wanting two computers.andP;  They want a desktop and alaptop or one in the car.andP;  Or maybe three -- one in the car, a laptop and adesktop.andM;We are going to go cautiously for one-to-one on the desktop and look at thelaptop as a different category.andP;  A guy who does a lot of crime scene work hasgot to have a laptop.andM;Our inspection staff is crying for laptops.andP;  Our Equal Employment Opportunitystaff wants them.andP;  I want one.andP;  The laptop is coming of age.andP;  When our agentsgo on the road, they write up their reports on laptops.andM;GCN: How will the changes overseas, in the Soviet Union and now in thePersian Gulf, affect the FBI and the mission of your division?andM;BAYSE: There will be more information processing requirements.andP;  There will bea bigger threat to information systems in the United States because we willhave a freer flow of individuals coming into the country.andM;Our FBI legal attaches in Europe will have a stronger need for real-timeintelligence information.andP;  It will put pressure on us for stronger controlson some of the international accesses.andM;What I see is growth in our databases of investigations of technologytransfer crimes and theft of technology.andP;  There is going to be a threat toU.S.andP;  technology.andP;  That is about as much as I can say about it.andM;William A. Bayse, assistant director of the FBI in charge of the TechnicalServices Division, reports to Associate Deputy Director for AdministrationJames W. Greenleaf.andM;Bayse directs the FBI's activities in engineering, research, officeautomation and information systems development.andP;  One of his favorite areas isartificial inteligence.andM;Bayse sees his task as making automation a mainstream part of the FBIorganization and culture.andM;GCN associate editor David W. Robb interviewed Bayse at FBI headquarters inWashington.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
