But this year nobody's sure how buyers are going to react to the crisis. We're all nervous.&quot;    But the concern of Mr. Geld and the other cattle sellers is unwarranted. Record prices are bid for the cattle. One prize cow is sold for $50,000, at the official exchange rate. The payment schedule is geared toward high inflation -- 20% is paid up front, and the rest will be paid in monthly installments spread out over the year. The buyers are discounting the purchase price by assuming a 15% monthly inflation rate for April and succeeding months, more than government predictions.    As it turns out, the inflation rate for April topped 21%. In addition, the recent resignation of Finance Minister Dilson Funaro amid the failure of the once-heralded Cruzado Plan has led to political turmoil within the dominant Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB); rumors circulate that President Jose Sarney will resign. The poor of the country are particularly hard hit by inflation, and there are increasing numbers of supermarket lootings and land takeovers. And all of this is taking place while a new constitution is being drafted. Yet the fact that wealthy Brazilians continue to reinvest capital at home during such a crisis sets this country apart from other Latin debtor nations. To be sure there is flight capital; some estimates run as high as $20 billion. But this nation of 140 million lacks the cynicism of, say, Argentina, where flight capital and emigration are far higher per capita.    Separated from the rest of Latin America by a language and a U.S.-like pride in a multiethnic melting pot of pioneers, Brazil's &quot;anything-is-possible&quot; attitude has led to dramatic developments in the past few decades. Vast stretches of previously uninhabited wilderness in such states as Mato Grosso, and even Amazon, have been transformed into some of the most productive farms in the world. And the industrial giants of Sao Paulo today successfully compete on an international level and occasionally pioneer advanced equipment, such as Embraer's successful airline-manufacturing line.    Perhaps because of past &quot;miracles,&quot; Brazilians are particularly susceptible to political and economic cure-alls. Thus, while few Argentine business people invested hope (or at least fixed capital) in the Austral Plan, the Brazilian Cruzado Plan -- which similarly relied on a strategy of wage and price controls to break the &quot;psychological momentum&quot; of inflation -- led to an enormous increase in investment on the part of medium-sized farmers and businessmen. More than one million salaried employees left their jobs last year to start small businesses, and more than 200,000 new enterprises were legally incorporated.    The country wanted desperately to believe in the magic of the Cruzado Plan. It was trumpeted here and abroad as a success, and the very few skeptics in Brazil were hounded as doom-sayers, or worse, traitors. One such critic was industrialist Henry Maksoud. As owner of Visao magazine, Mr. Maksoud wrote many articles denouncing the Cruzado Plan as a fake. Says Mr. Maksoud: &quot;The government successfully fooled the people into believing that inflation is rising prices. So when the central bank kept increasing the monetary base during the wage and price freeze, people still believed that inflation was finished. Of course, it was merely being repressed; the public deficit -- which was the real cause of inflation -- was being monetized by the printing of money.&quot;    In an interview just before his resignation, Mr. Funaro denied that the government was dramatically increasing M1 during the wage and price freeze. &quot;Today, the monetary base is not much more than one year ago,&quot; said Mr. Funaro. However, Mr. Maksoud's figures -- which were obtained from sources within the government -- show the monetary base growing from 52 billion cruzados in February 1986 -- just before implementation of the plan -- to 121 billion cruzados the following June.    When shortages in controlled items finally forced official and unofficial lifting of price controls, the pressure cooker blew wide open. Monthly inflation was 7% in December, 16.8% in January and estimates for April range from 21% to 25%. And as inflation rises so do interest rates, hitting hard those start-up companies that had invested so much in the future success of the plan. Says Rio de Janeiro Sen. Roberto Campos: &quot;The big industries reacted to the artificial increase in demand by cleaning out their inventories. But the small and medium-sized businesses mounted huge debts to expand their output, thinking that inflation would remain low and consumer demand would stay high. Now these small entrepreneurs are going bankrupt.&quot; The filings of the Brazilian equivalent of a Chapter 11 since the first of this year have increased 10 times over the 1986 filings.    The effects of taxation also have taken their toll. In order to curb demand, at the height of the Cruzado Plan, the government instituted new consumption taxes, the stiffest occurring last November. These taxes may have curbed demand, but they also helped push up inflation. And with the lifting of wage controls, &quot;bracket creep&quot; is hurting the middle class that increasingly gets pushed up into higher tax brackets.    So where's the silver lining in this dark cloud? &quot;Well, things are now so bad that people are looking for an alternative,&quot; says Donald Stewart, a Rio-based businessman who helped found a free-market think tank with branches in key Brazilian cities. &quot;Since the crisis began intensifying after Mr. Funaro announced his moratorium of external debt payments, outside forces can't be blamed. The people see the cause of the crisis as a result of internal economic policy, and they're looking for something else.&quot; Sen. Campos claims that fully one-third of the representatives in congress are now in favor of deregulating the economy, whereas only 10% want the same or more regulation. The rest fluctuate between the two positions.    Of course, the danger that Brazil could become yet more interventionist has certainly not been ruled out. Paulo Guedes, economist for the Brazilian Institute for Capital Markets, warns that if the PMDB's more radical advisers gain sway, an &quot;internal moratorium&quot; may follow the external one. Explains Mr. Guedes: &quot;What if the government simply stopped paying out interest on its bonds? Maybe the politicians will say: 'Why should we continue paying out interest to rich bankers and industrialists when we can use this money for the poor?' Such an internal moratorium could lead to the complete nationalization of financial institutions.&quot;    But even this pessimistic account is tempered by Mr. Guedes's confidence in the Brazilian spirit. &quot;We are in for a very tough five years,&quot; says Mr. Guedes. &quot;But I don't think Brazil will turn socialist. It's our nature to grow and develop, and once we have a strong political or economic institutional shock -- and we're close to that now -- things will have to change.&quot;    ---   Mr. Asman edits the Journal's Americas column. </TEXT></DOC>
