<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0224 </DOCNO><TEXT>The results of an extended experimental program on coal pyrolysis andhydropyrolysis in different equipment are analysed and the present knowledgeabout the modeling of coal pyrolysis reactions is reviewed. The limitsof the applicability of the model of independent parallel decompositionreactions are discussed in terms of the coaction of primary and secondaryreactions and the influence of process parameters like pressure and typeof gas atmosphere, heating rate, and residence time. 28 refs., 29 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
