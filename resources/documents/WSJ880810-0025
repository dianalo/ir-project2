The suits were brought by the federal government and the thrift's former shareholders.    The payment, one of the largest ever made by a law firm to settle allegations of misconduct, removes Blank Rome as a defendant from continuing suits against former officers and directors of Sunrise Savings andamp; Loan Association, a once highflying thrift in Boynton Beach, Fla.    The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. had accused Blank Rome in a September 1986 suit of negligence in providing advice to Sunrise, aiding thrift officials in making irresponsible loans, and creating conflicts of interest by representing both Sunrise and borrowers in various transactions.    In a prepared statement, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said the settlement with Blank Rome &quot;demonstrates that where violations contributing to insolvency are caused by the negligence or malpractice of professionals, including law firms, the Bank Board will hold them, as well as thrift management, fully responsible.&quot;    Blank Rome, which has about 210 lawyers and specializes in areas such as financial services and real estate, agreed to the settlement without admitting any liability or wrongdoing. But the firm's lead outside attorney, John Harkins Jr., said, &quot;There were some mistakes made in the way some of the loans (by Sunrise) were handled&quot; by lawyers who have since left Blank Rome's West Palm Beach, Fla., office. &quot;I don't think they did anything illegal,&quot; Mr. Harkins added.    Under the settlement, which requires court approval, Blank Rome will make cash payments of about $29 million to the FSLIC and $10 million to a fund to be distributed to shareholders. The firm also will set aside approximately $11 million to cover possible claims by outside parties against Blank Rome in connection with its representation of Sunrise. Money left over from the fund for outside claims would become available to the FSLIC and shareholders beginning in 1991.    David Girard-diCarlo, Blank Rome's managing partner, said the firm's insurance would cover the entire settlement. Blank Rome expects revenue of about $46 million in 1988, he said.    The settlement is contingent on Blank Rome receiving court-ordered protection against claims by other defendants in the pending lawsuits involving Sunrise.    Stanley Wolfe, co-lead counsel for a class of Sunrise shareholders who had sued Blank Rome separately, called the settlement &quot;very fair from our point of view.&quot;    Partners of Blank Rome created Sunrise in 1980, solicited its original investors and attended its board meetings. Two of the law firm's senior partners, Michael Foxman and M. Kalman Gitomer, served at different times as chairman of the thrift. Its assets grew to $1.5 billion from $4.7 million in only five years. During that period, Blank Rome collected fees of about $7 million for serving as Sunrise's main outside counsel.    But the Bank Board seized control of Sunrise in July 1985 after determining that the thrift was insolvent and appointed the FSLIC as receiver. In its 1986 lawsuit, the FSLIC accused Sunrise and its advisers of negligent practices, such as making bad loans to developers based on inflated appraisals and without securing adequate collateral.    In addition, the shareholders' class action accused Messrs. Foxman and Gitomer of violating federal securities laws by selling Sunrise stock in late 1984 and 1985 just before negative financial reports were released and the stock price fell. Both men have denied the allegations.    Federal regulators eventually closed Sunrise and transferred its assets to a newly created privately held thrift called Beach Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association. </TEXT></DOC>
