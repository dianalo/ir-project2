And in music circles, the Neville Brothers are known as``musician's musicians.''   For over 30 years, the Neville name has been synonymous with allthe traditions of the Crescent city. Their sound is culled from agumbo of styles _ jazz, Caribbean, African, Cajun, rock, funk _resulting in music as distinctive as New Orleans itself. CharlesNeville, who plays saxophone, calls it New Orleans rhythm and blues.   The brothers _ Art, Aaron, Charles and Cyril _ workedindividually for more than two decades before they finally mergedtheir diverse talents in 1977. After several albums and a two-yearinterlude, the band has just released their new album, ``YellowMoon.''   The collection, including eight original songs, is perhaps theirmost political and personal album, one in which they express theirconcern for social issues.   The album's first single, ``Sister Rosa,'' is a tribute to RosaParks, who became one of the catalysts for the civil rightsmovement in 1955 when she refused to give up her seat for a whiteperson on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Ala. The rap-reggaenumber, written and performed by percussionist Cyril, reflects thealbum's overall theme: to educate people by increasing theirawareness.   ``If you don't learn from history, it tends to repeat itselfbecause it can definitely happen again,'' said Art, the keyboardist.   ``Look at the neo-nazis and Skinheads,'' added Cyril, wearing a``Stop Apartheid'' button. ``We want to give youth a chance to lookat each other on their own terms, rather than how it was in thelast generation who had a certain amount of fear and hatred pumpedinto them before they got a chance to look at people and decide forthemselves.   ``We want to convey to youth that they don't have to besuperhuman or smart to make a change for the better in the world.''   ``My Blood,'' another song by Cyril, speaks about the roots ofoppression, with particular mention of South Africans, Haitians andnative Americans.   There's also a remake of Sam Cooke's ``A Change Is Gonna Come,''and two Bob Dylan covers, ``The Ballad of Hollis Brown'' and ``WithGod on Our Side.'' Although Aaron and Cyril trade off as leadvocalists on most of the album, Art gets the chance to belt out``Fire and Brimstone'' with the same enthusiasm he seems to havefor life in general. Charles is heard prominently on theinstrumental ``Healing Chant.''   There is a tenuous and harmonious thread to ``Yellow Moon,''partly due to producer Daniel Lanois' (Peter Gabriel, U2) recordingstyle. He used a New Orleans apartment instead of a studio.   ``His method of recording is to build the studio around theartist, rather than force the artist to conform to some existingenvironment,'' Charles said.   ``The nickname for the studio became `the swamp,''' Cyril saidwith a laugh. ``A whole atmosphere was created which you are ableto hear on the record.''   Jonathan Demme (``Something Wild,'' ``Married to the Mob'')directed the video for ``Sister Rosa.'' The filmmaker shares themusicians' interest in Haiti. After working with artists there andhearing Cyril sing ``My Blood,'' Demme wanted American artists togo to Haiti to perform.   ``But he didn't want it to be like a Sun City,'' said Cyril,referring to the so-called integrated music venue in South Africa.``He wanted people with more similar roots and backgrounds.'' Thebrothers and Demme are working on a video with the Haitian band LesFreres Parent.   The brothers' musical roots go back to the '50s. Art was part ofthe Hawkettes in 1954 when they recorded the legendary New Orleansanthem, ``Mardi Gras Mambo.'' In the 1970s, he helped form theMeters, a funk group with great impact on fellow musicians and suchnew bands as The Police.   Charles was busy touring with Big Mac Bell, Bobby ``Blue'' Blandand B.B. King. Aaron had a Top 10 hit in 1967 with ``Tell It LikeIt Is.'' Cyril was involved in his own band before he joined Artwith the Meters in Europe, who were touring with the Rolling Stones.   When Charles and Aaron joined the Meters to record ``The WildTchoupitoulas'' album, it was the first time in years the brothershad all played together.   ``It happened so easily and beautifully, and we were so proud ofthe finished product,'' said Cyril. So they decided to form theNeville Brothers.   Although their popularity stems from their hometown of NewOrleans, they initially didn't have a large following as a group.   ``We used to play Tipitina's. You could blow it up and get noone but the Neville Brothers,'' Art recalled. ``But we're justenjoying it as it happens.'' Tipitina's is a popular New Orleansmusic hall, and was featured in the film ``The Big Easy'' alongwith The Neville Brothers music.   After the release of their first album, ``The NevilleBrothers,'' the group took off. Their 1981 ``Fiyo on the Bayou''was a critical and commercial success. Rolling Stones guitaristKeith Richards called it the best album of that year. But their1987 ``Uptown'' didn't quite make it. Even devoted fans felt it wasan attempt at mass appeal. ``Yellow Moon'' should dispel any doubtsof the brothers' integrity.   A Cinemax special in May will include such guests as BonnieRaitt, Gregg Allman, Buckwheat Zydeco, Jimmy Buffett, John Hiattand TV journalist Ed Bradley who will perform ``Sixty Minute Man''with the Brothers. Bradley is one of many fans who has danced withwild abandon at a Neville Brothers concert. ``Our music isdefinitely dance music. That's the way to respond to it,'' saidCharles. ``The same energy we put out is recycled through theaudience. In a place with no dance floor, there's less energycoming back from the audience.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, April 14-16 and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
