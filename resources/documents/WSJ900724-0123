For 17 months of elections, caucuses, conventions, courtfights, bickering and threats, the state's Republicans turnedagainst themselves in a savage blood feud. Grown men threwferocious tantrums at the doors of party meetings. Elderlywomen in wheelchairs slugged opponents in the nose. Hardlyanyone knew what they were fighting about, but the conflictbetween the establishment forces of George Bush and the moreactivist, populist legions of Jack Kemp and Pat Robertsonbecame a symbol of the struggle over the character of theGOP.</LP><TEXT>   Now that battle is entering another phase, spilling overonto the Aug. 7 Republican primary to select a challenger toface Democratic Sen. Carl Levin in November. With many woundsstill unhealed, Michigan's weary GOP voters must choosebetween Rep. Bill Schuette, a modern version of the old-guardMidwestern Republican, or Clark Durant, who speaks the newmantra of entrepreneurism and market choices.   &quot;These,&quot; says Brooks Patterson, who was Mr. Bush'scampaign co-chairman in Michigan in 1988, &quot;are twoRepublicans who represent two views of the party.&quot;   Mr. Schuette is the favorite, but there are too manyvariables in a midsummer primary, being held at a time whenmany of the GOP voters are more interested in tanning lotionthan tax policy, to be certain of the outcome. With adedicated band of -- this is not too severe a word --zealots, Mr. Durant is giving Mr. Schuette a lesson from themillions of automobiles that still are produced in thisstate: Objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear.   Mr. Schuette is proceeding cautiously, emphasizing hissupport from the GOP establishment. He has the backing ofcounty chairmen in 61 of the state's 83 counties and thesupport of 51 of the 70 Republicans in the state Legislature.He has the endorsement of the National Association ofHomebuilders, the National Federation of IndependentBusinesses, the American Medical Association, the AmericanBankers Association and the Michigan Farm Bureau.   The Schuette strategy is to act as if Mr. Durant doesn'texist. &quot;We've made this a Bill Schuette-Carl Levin race,&quot; Mr.Schuette says. &quot;My gunsights are right on Carl Levin.&quot;   Mr. Durant, however, has taken direct aim at Mr. Schuette.&quot;The choice is a status-quo, conventional, establishmentRepublican or an opportunity-oriented populist,&quot; he says.&quot;The party is going to have to make this decision sometime.&quot;   The other night, when a questioner at a candidates' forumin the Detroit suburbs blamed the Democrats for thehigh-spending ways of Washington, Mr. Durant interrupted:&quot;We're both guilty.&quot;   Last week, Mr. Durant began a new offensive designed tounderscore his status as an outsider. The charge: Mr.Schuette &quot;voted along with the pack&quot; and supported thesavings-and-loan bailout, which Mr. Durant described as oneof those typical Washington &quot;giveaways.&quot;   The counter-charge: Mr. Durant invested more than $50,000in a Texas thrift. &quot;Here's a guy who's totally against theSandamp;L bailout and yet he invested money in a Texas Sandamp;L that got$1.3 billion in government tax write-offs,&quot; says DouglasMcAuliffe, the Schuette campaign director.   The response: &quot;I put some savings in a bank because Iwanted a good return,&quot; Mr. Durant says. &quot;I didn't cost thetaxpayer anything. He cost them billions with his vote.&quot;   Mr. Durant has been speaking his anti-government idiom foryears; in 1976, in an act of political apostasy, he supportedRonald Reagan against Michigan's own Gerald Ford. WhenPresident Reagan appointed him chairman of the Legal ServicesCorp., he tried (unsuccessfully) to cut its budget sharplyand trim its purview. He helped salvage the bankrupt AnnArbor Railroad, a state-owned and state-subsidized, 47-milespur from Ann Arbor to Toledo, Ohio, transforming it, hetells campaign audiences, from &quot;a tax user to a tax payer.&quot;   But he is best known in Michigan for refusing to defectwith the Kemp forces who in early 1988 abandoned an alliancewith Pat Robertson and went with George Bush. Mr. Durant, anational co-chairman of the Kemp campaign, clung to what hecalled the &quot;Anybody But Bush&quot; effort. &quot;Clark is the last ofthe believers,&quot; says John Buckley, who was press secretary tothe Kemp campaign.   Many of the novices who swarmed into politics in theRobertson campaign now have drifted into the Durant camp.&quot;This isn't the Robertson campaign reborn, but it's the kindof campaign that a lot of the Robertson people feelcomfortable in,&quot; says Marlene Elwell, a principal Robertsonorganizer who isn't involved in the 1990 Senate primary.   The 36-year-old Mr. Schuette, a rather conventional figurewho would melt easily into the crowd at a Bush fund-raiser inany downtown hotel, may have erred in permitting himself tobecome the issue rather than his opponent, who is oftenregarded as a quirky iconoclast and a &quot;bomb thrower,&quot; even byhis allies. The editors of the Monroe Guardian, a weeklynewspaper published in a blue-collar corner of southeastMichigan, may have underlined Mr. Schuette's vulnerabilitywhen they wrote in their endorsement of Mr. Durant that he&quot;appears to have a clear vision of what America should be,while Schuette appears to have only a vision of himself inoffice.&quot;   But Mr. Schuette isn't any bland Babbitt. &quot;He's amoderate,&quot; says Patrick Anderson, an ardent conservative whois the former president of the Farmington Area RepublicanClub, &quot;but a good moderate.&quot; He's taking a gamble, moreover,by relinquishing a safe seat in the northern half ofMichigan's Lower Peninsula covering the rolling farms, inlandlakes and small towns west of Saginaw Bay that spawned ThomasE. Dewey and today is a patchwork of knotty-pine fishingcottages, hunting lodges and chemical plants.   Mr. Schuette himself is the son of a Dow Chemical plantmanager and the stepson of a retired Dow chairman, and at age31 he defeated three-term Democratic Rep. Donald Albosta, asugar-beet farmer, by 1,314 votes. Soon he became the House'smost outspoken voice for Michigan's dry edible beans, winninghis constituents' loyalty by closing a loophole thatdepressed bean prices. By 1988, when he won with 73% of thevote, he was campaigning as &quot;Michigan's congressman&quot; and soonbegan describing himself at Lincoln Day dinners -- he spokeat 25 in the first 90 days of 1989 -- as &quot;a footsoldier inCongress when Ronald Reagan made our revolution of ideas areality.&quot;   Mr. Schuette brags that he was &quot;for George Bush before itwas cool&quot; -- he supported Mr. Bush over Mr. Reagan in 1980 --but he broke with the president this summer when Mr. Bushindicated that tax revenues had to be part of a budgetagreement. &quot;If you raise taxes, you turn the throttle off,shut off the steam of the economy, and there will be no gasfor growth,&quot; he says.   But Mr. Durant, 41 years old, likes to say that while Mr.Schuette supports &quot;no new taxes,&quot; he supports even lowertaxes. &quot;No new taxes is not a good enough answer,&quot; he says.&quot;We penalize labor, capital, savings, thrift and risk-taking,and you can't compete with that.&quot;   Republicans hope, perhaps vainly, that the bitterness thatstarted with the first round of precinct-level elections thatkicked off the 1988 campaign four years ago will finallydissipate after next month's primary. &quot;Carl Levin is far moreliberal than the average Michigan resident,&quot; says GOP stateSen. Richard Posthumus, who hasn't endorsed either man.&quot;Party people know that the destruction has to be kept undercontrol so we can talk about taxes and foreign policy in thefall against a very vulnerable incumbent.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
