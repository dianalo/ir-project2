Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson on Monday cited the continuingdrain on the estate of ex-billionaire William Herbert Hunt, inannouncing he would convert the case from a Chapter 11reorganization to Chapter 7 liquidation on Nov. 20.   The ruling gives major creditors just two weeks to work out acompromise that they have failed to reach since the oilman and sonof the late H.L. Hunt filed for bankruptcy in September 1988.   ``We were happy the judge gave us two weeks to fix it. He couldhave just converted it today,'' said Stephen McCartin of Gardere andamp;Wynne, Hunt's attorney.   Other attorneys weren't so optimistic, saying privately that theydoubted the gap between two major creditors in the case could bebridged in such a short time.   If it is converted to Chapter 7, the remaining assets of Hunt'sonce vast estate would be sold off rapidly, with most of theproceeds going to the Internal Revenue Service, the largest creditorin the case with a claim of $300 million in back taxes.   The judge also said the continued litigation facing the estatewas drying up what few proceeds remained.   ``The court cannot continue to sit by idly while thiscontinues,'' Judge Abramson said.   Under bankruptcy procedures, creditors and the debtor filereorganization plans and try to reach a consensus on repayment ofdebt. Plans have been filed by Hunt and three major creditors. Butthe judge said Monday that none of the reorganization plans beforehim were confirmable.   The ruling has no impact on Herbert's brother, Nelson BunkerHunt, who also sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11last year.   Herbert Hunt, who was on hand with his wife, Nancy, to hear thedecision, has assets currently valued at $125 million to satisfydebts of nearly $900 million, bankruptcy court filings show.   A Chapter 7 liquidation of Herbert Hunt's estate would reap $60million to $70 million, or roughly half the $125 million that wouldbe divided among creditors under Chapter 11 of the federalbankruptcy code.   Hundreds of smaller creditors would get nothing if the estate isliquidated under Chapter 7, attorneys involved in the case say.   ``I am quite disappointed. I think this is a disaster for theunsecured creditors,'' said Claude D. Montgomery, attorney for thebankruptcy trustee in the Hunt International Resources Corp. case.   ``The stuff in this estate is incredibly illiquid,'' said ThomasO. Gorman, an attorney representing Minpeco S.A., a major creditorin the case. ``It just depends on whether they have to sell it alltomorrow.''   The ruling was prompted by the ongoing dispute between Minpeco, amining concern owned by the Peruvian government, and ManufacturersHanover Trust Co., a New York bank that has a $36 million claim inthe case.   Manufacturers Hanover says its claim should have priority over a$132 million judgment Minpeco is trying to collect from the two Huntbrothers. The judgment, which has swelled to more than $250 millionwith interest and attorneys fees, stems from the Hunt's silverconspiracy case.</TEXT></DOC>
