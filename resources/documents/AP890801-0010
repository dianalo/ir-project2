The storm had strengthened rapidly after growing early Mondayfrom a tropical depression to a tropical storm. It had a maximumsustained wind speed of 65 mph in early afternoon and increased to75 mph, 1 mph over the threshold for reclassifying a tropical storma hurricane, by 6 p.m. EDT.   Hurricane warnings were posted from Freeport, Texas, to MorganCity, La.   ``It's not going to be a major hurricane, but there will bebeach erosion, tides 10 feet above normal in some places and 10 to15 inches of rain over Mississippi, Louisiana and eastern Texas,''said Todd Kimberlain of the National Hurricane Center.   The same area was deluged in late June by Tropical Storm Allison.   According to the hurricane center, the hurricane's center'slikeliest landfall would be at 7 p.m. CDT Tuesday in the area ofPort Arther and Galveston, Texas.   Forecasters said there was a 53 percent chance of the stormcentering on Port Arthur and a 52 percent chance of centering onGalveston.   The hurricane center emphasizes that its calculations are onlyprobablities based on previous storm tracks extrapolated fromHurricane Chantal's current path.   Squalls on the edge of the storm dumped heavy rain on NewOrleans and forced closure of the 24-mile long causeway across LakePontchartrain.   About 2,500 people on Grand Isle, a tiny resort area just offthe southeast Louisiana coast, were asked to go to the mainland.Mayor Andy Valence said he feared Louisiana Highway 1, the onlyroute off the island, would flood.   In southwest Louisiana's Cameron Parish (county), civil defensedirector Hayes Picou about 8,500 of the low-lying parish's 10,000residents had evacuated the southern coast, most to stay withfriends or relatives.   Two emergency shelters opened in nearby Lake Charles, with 67Cameron residents staying in one shelter.   ``These people are from Cameron. They've been through this morethan once. They brought all the necessities. Some brought TVs. Somebrought radios,'' said Nancy Cowan, Red Cross disaster chairman forCalcasieu and Cameron parishes.   Lutie Dyson, 62, said she and her husband, Clarence, 73, aretired commercial fisherman, have frequently evacuated their homessince June 1967, when Hurricane Audrey slammed ashore and killed526 people, injured nearly 4,000, destroyed or damaged more than2,500 homes and left millions of dollars in damage.   ``I can't tell you exactly, maybe 10 or 12 times since Audrey,''said Mrs. Dyson, a mother of 15 who lost her home to Audrey. ``Ifthey tell us to get out, we get out.''   Told landfall was expected near Port Arthur, Mrs. Dyson replied:``They told us that for Audrey, too, and we got Audrey. I pray itdoesn't hit anybody, but we have to take what God sends. We alwaysput the Lord on our side.''   Heavy weather on the storm's fringe halted the search for 10 menlost when an oil rig capsized while being moved south of MorganCity. The Coast Guard flew divers to the rig despite 12-foot seasand 60-mph winds.   One man died after falling from a Chevron platform south of NewOrleans.   At midnight EDT, the hurricane's center was near latitude 28.1north and longitude 93.1 west, or about 130 miles southeast ofGalveston. It was moving north-northwest at 10 mph and forecastersexpected it to continue to gain strength and follow thatnorthwesterly path into midday Tuesday.   ``This should bring the center over the upper Texas or westernLouisiana coast tomorrow afternoon or evening,'' said Bob Sheets,the hurricane center's director.   Sheets said tropical storm force wind extended outward 150 milesto the north and 125 miles to the south of the center. A fewtornadoes were also likely over sections of Louisiana and extremeeastern Texas during the night and Tuesday, he said.   Texans also began girding for the hurricane while oil companiesremoved hundreds of workers from rigs and platforms in the Gulf.   ``We've evacuated everybody,'' said Conoco Inc. spokesmanMichael O'Connor. ``Our production is automated. We've set them ontimers.''   ``We're planning for the worst and hoping for the best,'' saidDoug Matthews, city manager of Galveston, an island city of 60,000just south of Houston.   ``The old bugaboo is where this baby is going to hit,'' saidJohn Jamison, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Galveston.   Chantal, the third named storm of the 1989 Atlantic hurricaneseason, formed earlier Monday from the season's fourth tropicaldepression in the south-central Gulf.   Meanwhile, in the open Atlantic, tropical depression No. 5 hadbecome Tropical Storm Dean by 11 p.m. EDT. It had top sustainedwinds of 40 mph and was centered near latitude 15.5 north andlongitude 47.8 west, or about 850 miles east of the Lesser Antilles.   It was moving west at about 15 mph, and was expected to gainstrength but hold its course, forecasters said.   Two other depressions have formed into named storms since the1989 Atlantic hurricane season began June 1.   In addition to Tropical Storm Allison, Storm Barry lived brieflyin the open Atlantic in mid-July before being downgraded to atropical depression and dissipating.</TEXT></DOC>
