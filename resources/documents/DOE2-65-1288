While coal can be utilized directly for energy applicationssuch as electrical power generation, much of the petroleum demand isbased in the liquid fuel and liquid feedstock areas. This potential demandfor liquid fuel and feedstock has caused a renewed interest in coal liquefactiontechnology. However, the development of coal liquefaction technologyto an industrially applicable level has been hindered by the lack ofa suitable kinetic model. Current kinetic models are based upon simplifiedanalytical techniques in which components are lumped into several solubilityor volatility classes. The development of such a kinetic model is thegoal of the coal liquefaction studies at Texas A and M University. Anyattempt to improve the kinetic model must therefore effect an improvementin one or more of the supporting areas. The coal liquefaction researchat Texas A and M University has resulted in significant advances in theareas of analytical technique, component lumping, and reactor modeling,thus providing the foundations for the development of a powerful newkinetic model. This paper describes the results which have been achievedand the course of the research now being followed in each of the supportiveareas: experimental reactions, analytical method, component lumping,reactor modeling, and parameter estimation.</TEXT></DOC>
