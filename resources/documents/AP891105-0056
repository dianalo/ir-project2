(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rolling Stones leader Mick Jaggermade a suprise stop at this earthquake ravaged towny to offerencouragement to its residents who are struggling to slowly rebuildtheir lives.   ``It's a bit hard to take in. It's such a small community,''said Jagger, who flew in by helicopter Saturday along with rockpromoter Bill Graham two hours before the Stones concert at theOakland Coliseum.   During the performance, Jagger spoke to the audience about theOct. 17 quake, saying: ``Our hearts go out to you who suffered fromthat. I know that you Northern Californians have an incrediblespirit ... so I don't have to tell you it's a wonderful place tolive.''   Earlier, as he made an hour-long tour of this agricultural townof 30,000, the 46-year-old Jagger projected an image far from his``bad boy'' pose when his band first came to prominence in the '60s.   He was surrounded by children in tattered clothes and Red Crossworkers when he stepped off a small bus at the Ramsey Parktent-city, and he nodded gravely while speaking to residents.   But at one point, Graham picked up 3-year-old Miguel Velasquez,and handed him to Jagger. Jagger handed the child back, saying,``I'm not a politician.''   ``With 1,400 people out of work in the downtown, it affectseveryone else. People don't know quite what they'll do,'' saidJagger, whose band has pledged $500,000 to be divided betweenvictims of the earthquake and Hurricane Hugo.   ``The future depends on how resilient the community is. It's nota very rich community to start with. That's when it really hurts,''he said.   Hundreds of Watsonville residents, including many impoverishedfarm workers, were left homeless by the 7.1-magnitude quake, whichkilled at least 66 people in Northern California.   Graham said they chose Watsonville because so much attention hadbeen focused on San Francisco. Jagger said he toured Managua,Nicaragua, his former wife's homeland, after its devastating 1972quake.</TEXT></DOC>
