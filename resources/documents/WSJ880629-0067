The trade pact provides that decisions by the Commerce Department or the U.S. International Trade Commission on dumping, countervailing duties and other trade issues involving Canada may be appealed to binational arbitration panels with members appointed by both countries.    Progress on the legislation has been stalled in large part over legal questions about how the U.S. government would carry out decisions of the binational panels. Justice Department officials and other legal observers have questioned whether it is constitutional to require that federal agencies directly carry out decisions by arbitration panels that aren't part of the federal government; these officials have urged that the law give the president special authority to order the decisions carried out.    Yesterday, officials from the White House, Justice and Treasury departments and the U.S. Trade Representative agreed on a solution with members of the House Judiciary Committee. Under the agreement, the legislation would require that arbitration-panel decisions be carried out directly by federal agencies. But if the requirement were found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, the legislation would establish a fallback system in which arbitration decisions would be transmitted to the president for his approval. Under the agreement, the president would issue an executive order saying that all such decisions would be approved.    But one critic, Alan Morrison of the consumer-oriented Public Citizen Litigation Group, said constitutional questions remain. He doubts the validity of having federal agency decisions appealed to binational panels whose members aren't either part of the judiciary or part of some special court system like the U.S. Tax Court. </TEXT></DOC>
