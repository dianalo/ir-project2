Twenty times earnings, you say? Thirty times earnings? Inthe case of Compaq Computer, such a stock can be had for 10times reported earnings -- way below the average stock'smultiple of 15 to 18, depending what index you use.</LP><TEXT>   Compaq is cheap because almost no one expects it tosustain the golden growth rates and profit margins of itspast. &quot;Compaq's long-term future is being seriouslyquestioned,&quot; says Mark Stahlman of Alex. Brown andamp; Sons, aformer fan who currently rates the stock a lukewarm &quot;hold.&quot;   But some money managers say Compaq has been smacked downso far as to create a great buying opportunity, even ifprofitability does slow. No sooner did the Houston-basedmaker of personal computers disclose that second-quarterearnings would probably trail the year-earlier's $1.18 ashare than the stock fell more than 9 points in one day lastmonth, to 52 1/2. It now stands at 49 5/8, nearly a thirdbelow February's peak of 74 1/4.   &quot;It's a classic overreaction stock,&quot; says David Dreman, aNew York money manager whose firm owns close to three millionCompaq shares. He used the recent price weakness to buy a fewmore shares for one of his mutual funds.   &quot;I think it's still a growth company,&quot; says WolodymyrWronskyj, manager of Dreyfus Fund. &quot;Computer stocks arealways highly fluctuating stocks. People overstate events. Ithink now they are overstating the problems.&quot;   Two clouds hang over Compaq. The strong dollar hurts it,because it gets about 54% of revenue abroad. So does thespecter of continuing PC price wars among IBM clones. Compaqhoned a premium image by consistently being first to unveilstate-of-the-art PCs. Today, for both technical and marketingreasons, this strategy is harder to follow. &quot;The game ischanging to a low-margin game,&quot; says Jim Poyner, analyst withWilliam K. Woodruff in Dallas. &quot;Management has just startedto grasp the reality of the situation.&quot;   Without a truly hot machine to sell at the moment, Compaqis looking in several new directions for growth. It iscounting on its notebook-sized computers; it has bought a 13%stake in Silicon Graphics, a maker of scientificworkstations; and it is targeting high-end systems as part ofa 21-company coalition called ACE (for Advanced ComputingEnvironment). But Compaq's ACE computers won't be ready forabout 15 months. And the SystemPro, which Compaq introducedin 1989 to act as a hub for computer networks, hasn't been asmashing success, though it generated a respectable $200million in 1990 sales.   Admirers say Compaq has overcome tough challenges before.Aren't they frightened by the increased competition,especially from AST Research and Dell Computer? Those twocompanies' PCs cost hundreds of dollars less than Compaq's,and the gap was more than $1,000 before Compaq began cuttingprices.   &quot;Everyone's afraid that we've entered the mother of allprice wars,&quot; says Merrill Lynch analyst Melinda Reach. &quot;Idon't think anything has really changed. It's always been ahighly competitive market. Compaq hasn't lost any marketshare. In fact, they have gained market share.&quot; She rates thestock a strong buy.   Mr. Dreman says Compaq is selling more computers than everin Europe; only the currency-translation problem keeps theresults from looking better. He doubts the dollar will risemuch from here, figuring the U.S. will curb the dollar's riseto avoid aggravating the recession.   Some money managers have bailed out. &quot;We sold at the endof January around 63,&quot; says James Severance, investmentdirector for stocks at the Wisconsin Investment Board. &quot;It'sa fine company, but . . . it's going to be increasinglydifficult for them to distinguish themselves from the pack.&quot;   One manager with a New York firm that sold Compaq sharespredicts that it will never again see the 20% to 30% returnson equity of past years. &quot;You need to be a near monopolist toearn&quot; those sorts of profits, he says. Selling PCs isbecoming &quot;a commodity business with tremendous pricecutting.&quot;   Well, suppose Compaq doesn't do as well as in the past.Suppose it earns only as much as the Street's lowest 1991estimate -- $4.53 a share. Today's stock price is only 11times that amount. For 1992, the lowest estimate (accordingto Zacks Investment Research) is $5.29 a share. Compaq sellsfor nine times that amount. The average estimate: $5.71 thisyear and $6.55 next year.   Similarly, suppose Compaq's return on net worth fell tohalf of the 23.2% achieved last year. That would be 11.6%,about what Compaq earned back in 1984, when it sold for 14times earnings.   ---   Compaq Computer   (NYSE; Symbol: CPQ)                                                                                                          Business: Computers                                                                                                          Year ended Dec. 31, 1990:   Sales: $3.60 billion   Net income: $454.9 million; or $5.12 a share (fullydiluted)                                                                                                          First quarter, March 31, 1991:   Per-share earnings: $1.26 vs. $1.06 (fully diluted)                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume:   1,135,302 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 90.8 million                                                                                                          Note: All share figures adjusted for 2-for-1 stock splitpaid in July 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
