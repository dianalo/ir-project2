These irradiation-induced defects can subsistfor a variable time period after the radioactive source has disappeared.They then act as a memory recording the irradiation of the mineral inits environment. The study of these defects allows one to extract thisinformation and, at the same time, provides information about the radiationhistory of the rock or deposit. We have chosen to study quartz, a mineralfound to be associated with the majority of uranium deposits and forwhich the behaviour under irradiation has been studied by physicists.The method of analysis used - Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) -is an extremely sensitive spectroscopic technique which provides unambiguousdetermination of the nature of an impurity or a paramagnetic defect ina solid. This technique, routinely used for the characterisation of defects,is relatively simple and rapid to apply when the observation conditionsfor the defect considered have been determined. By numerous analysesof samples of many origins we have been able to demonstrate the existenceof a radiation-induced centre which is well adapted to recording of naturalradioactivity and the passage of uranium mineralization events. Thiscentre, called the E'/sub 1/ centre, is an intrinsic defect made up ofan oxygen vacancy with a trapped electron. An experimental study of thisdefect has enabled us to determine its principal characteristics. Twouranium deposits have been studied in particular detail by this method:the Cluff D deposit (Saskatchewan, Canada) and the deposit at Bernardanin la Marche region, France.</TEXT></DOC>
