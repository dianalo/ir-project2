Trounstine is the Mercury News Political Editor.  </MEMO><TEXT>     It's an uncomfortable role for the news media. As an assistant managingeditor of the San Jose Mercury News once put it: &quot;We do facts, not truth.&quot;;   But discussions among political consultants suggest that as televisioncommercials extend and amplify the reach and power of campaign negatives,political writers will be called on in 1992 to become arbiters of truth.;   The result may well be an historic shift in the function of politicalreporting, marked by increasingly judgmental assertions of the kind thatcareful analytical news writers have long avoided.;    In 1990 we saw thecommon use of so-called &quot;truth boxes,&quot; in which charges were dispassionatelyanalyzed and both sides' reasoning was provided. Many times, these would buryreaders under an avalanche of facts, lacking the punch of the originalmessage.;    Too often, purported &quot;truth boxes&quot; were nothing more than&quot;he-said, she-said&quot; reports or worse -- quasi-reviews by would-be mediacritics.;    Seldom did an article or accompanying graphic state on its ownauthority that a particular charge was false or, even more important, untrue.;   When journalists do offer sharp conclusions about candidates' misuse offacts, their consultants are predictably unhappy. Pete Wilson's campaignhandlers were enraged when the Mercury News ran the headline &quot;Wilson addistorts Feinstein's record on raising taxes&quot; over a story by Bert Robinsonthat began:;    &quot;Sen. Pete Wilson on Wednesday unveiled a biting televisioncommercial that falsely accuses his gubernatorial opponent, Dianne Feinstein,of raising taxes 34 percent as mayor of San Francisco.&quot;;    But as politicalprofessionals rely increasingly on negative advertising to shape theircampaigns, voters are calling on the news media to tell them whether thecharges they've seen on TV are true.;    Responding to this task would seemsimple. Except for this: truth is more than the sum of selected facts --especially when those facts have been selected to convey a point of view.;   &quot;Negatives in politics have been around forever,&quot; opposition researcher PhilNoble said last weekend at a conference run by Campaigns and Electionsmagazine. &quot;The Federalists said of Jefferson that if he was elected(president), 'rape, robbery, fornication and incest will be openly taught andpracticed.' &quot;;    Lying with the facts;  But in the age of market research,overnight polling and powerfully intrusive advertising technology, consultantshave perfected the art of using incontrovertible data to portray a false imageof an opponent -- that is, lying with the facts.;    In San Jose, for example,mayoral candidate Susan Hammer sent out a computer-targeted mailer chargingthat Councilwoman Shirley Lewis was not in favor of controlled growth. Thepiece used Lewis' votes in favor of increased housing in the Berryessa area asproof. These were facts. But as they were packaged, they told a lie. Lewis isa leader of the pro-growth forces in San Jose, her votes for increasinghousing in Berryessa were essential to preventing sprawl at the city'sfringe.;    Dianne Feinstein's TV ad based on &quot;five Sandamp;L facts,&quot; including thatthrift executives gave then-Sen. Pete Wilson $243,000 in campaigncontributions, tied Wilson to a scandal to which he had no demonstratedconnection. Despite the facts cited in the ad, Wilson had never functioned, asthe ad implied.;    Wilson's retort, however, was equally faulty, chargingthat Feinstein and her husband Richard Blum &quot;own&quot; an Sandamp;L that received an $87million federal bailout. Through Blum's investment partnerships, they actually&quot;own&quot; .25 percent of the stock of the thrift in question.;    &quot;She threw thefirst big mudpie and so they came back,&quot; said GOP consultant Ray McNally ofSacramento. &quot;What they said was true, but maybe just a bit overstated.&quot;;   &quot;Negatives are used because they work,&quot; said Washington consultant MarkMellman. &quot;But in order to work, negatives have to meet some kinds of basiccriteria. First of all they ought to be, in fact need to be, truthful andhonest.;    You must 'tell the truth';  &quot;If you're wrong about the facts, ifyou say something that's not true, it's going to redound to your discreditmuch more sharply than it's going to redound to the discredit of the personyou attack. So it's absolutely important to tell the truth about youropponent.&quot;;    This excellent distillation of the ethics of negativecampaigning has become an article of faith among consultants.;    Yet considerthe example Mellman himself offered to illustrate the point: a 1982 campaignin which, as he put it, &quot;We had one basic message -- this incumbent Republicanvoted to cut Social Security. Fact. Documentable fact.&quot;;    By Mellman'saccount, however, the Republican candidate responded that he never had votedto cut Social Security. He had voted for the budget bill for the United Statesthat included a cut in Social Security. But on every amendment, throughout theprocess, he had voted against cuts in Social Security.;    'What is thetruth?';  &quot;To which we can reasonably respond, 'Yes, that's true. But somenumber of members of Congress decided that that Social Security cut was soimportant and such a priority that they actually would not vote for the entirebudget of the United State of America if it included that kind of cut inSocial Security.';    &quot;And what is the truth? Did this person vote to cutSocial Security or did he not? It's really not clear what the truth is in thatparticular case. Frankly, both were true. It's not clear that one isabsolutely true and the other is absolutely false,&quot; Mellman said.;    Butvoters are screaming at newspapers: &quot;Tell us the truth!&quot; Did Mellman'scandidate tell the truth even if his charge is based on a documentable fact?;   What should the news media do when Candidate A makes a charge -- based onthe facts -- that is fundamentally untrue about Candidate B?;    &quot;We want youto run a banner headline saying he's a dog,&quot; said Noble.;    &quot;I believe theyought to write what they think is true, which is that it is a campaign tacticto distort the reality using selective facts,&quot; said consultant Mike Murphy.;   &quot;And then we have the freedom to take that clip and put it in a TV ad andfight to the death with it. And if that's unfair, you write another story andthey get their clip and beat us to death with it -- as long as you have anobjective standard for judging both of them,&quot; he said.;    In major racessince 1986, the San Jose Mercury News has examined the caricatures thecandidates have crafted of themselves and their opponents for their validity.We've tried to distill campaigns' bumper-sticker messages, their sound-bitethemes and tell our readers whether or not they were true.;    In some cases-- Ed Zschau and Alan Cranston -- we concluded that the candidates wereessentially telling the truth about themselves and their opponents. In others-- Michael Dukakis and George Bush -- we said the candidates were dishonestlyportraying one another.;    Like other papers, we have begun to use &quot;truthboxes&quot; -- but only where we think our analysis cuts through misstatements ordisinformation. Our challenge in 1992 will be to find better and morecompelling ways of letting our readers know whether what they are reading inthe mail, hearing on the radio and seeing on TV is truthful.;    This is not atask we undertake eagerly. It is far easier to examine and present facts andleave it to the reader to come to a conclusion. But with the advance oftechnology that allows negative messages to drive campaigns, readers wantmore. They want us to cut through the facts for them. As we do, our role inAmerican politics may see a dramatic transformation. (box)  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Philip J.
