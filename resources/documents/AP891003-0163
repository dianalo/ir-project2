The rebels failed to capture Noriega in the coup attempt,according to the reports.   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater saidthe coup appeared to have failed.   The rebel troops claimed that they seized and held the DefenseForces headquarters in downtown Panama City. Troops loyal toNoriega climbed the roofs of surrounding buildings, throwing handgrenades, firing mortars and sniping at targets inside the compound.   Noriega has defied U.S. efforts to oust him for two years andsurvived a coup attempt in March 1988. He has been indicted on drugcharges in the United States, which accuses him of having ties toColombia drug traffickers.   The coup announcement was read over national radio at about11:30 a.m. It said the entire high command was forced intoretirement by middle-ranking officers led by Maj. Moises GiraldiVega, head of the Urraca battalion in charge of security at DefenseForces headquarters.   The communique was signed by Giraldi, Capt. Javier Licona of thecavalry and Capt. Jesus George Balma of the special forces.   ``This is strictly a military movement. There is no politicsinvolved,'' the communique said, referring to the civilianopposition that has been trying to topple Noriega with U.S. help.   The communique did not say whether any members of the highcommand were in custody.   An hour later a man who identified himself as Lt. Col. ArnulfoCastrejon made a television broadcast saying that forces loyal toNoriega ``were ready to give their lives to defend Gen. Noriega.This is a betrayal.''   However, nobody was visible on the screen as the broadcast wasmade. The camera showed only a clock on a wall.   The communique said Noriega and six top colonels were being``retired'' because they had been on active service for more than25 years and exceeded the deadline for mandatory retirement.   Jose Blandon, a Panamanian defector and former close aide toNoriega, said in Washington that he had spoken by telephone withBalma, one of the leaders of the coup, who told him that Noriegahad been wounded and was in custody.   He said officers intended to send Noriega to the United Statesto face drug charges, but that it would be difficult to do sobecause other officers in the defense forces also were involved inthe drug trade.   Blandon said the coup had been timed for a moment when manytroops loyal to Noriega were outside of Panama participating in anisland training exercise.   At the United Nations, Panama's provisional president accusedthe United States of undermining his nation with ``financialterrorism, economic blackmail and political interference.''   ``The government today has had to control a new attempt atsubversion, frustrated by the will of our people and our armedforces,'' President Francisco Rodriguez told the General Assembly.   President Bush denied that the United States was involved in theoperation.   ``Nobody's sure what's happening there,'' the president toldreporters at the White House. ``There were rumors around that thiswas some American operation and I can tell you that is not true.''   But Bush, implying his endorsement to oust Noriega, added: ``Wehave no argument with the Panamanian Defense Forces. We have noargument with them.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he was unable toconfirm that Noriega had been ousted. He said the United States hadadvance word of the uprising.   One U.S. administration official said the White House was notconvinced Noriega had been toppled, although that was possible.   ``We've got conflicting reports,'' the official said, speakingon condition of anonymity. ``There have been conflicting reportsabout how successful it's been.''   In Washington, former Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, ananti-Noriega activist, said before the radio announcement that theshooting was part of a coup attempt carried out by dissidentswithin the Defense Forces.   Sosa said there has been discontent among some officers who werepassed over in recent promotions and who were dissatisfied forother reasons.   ``It's been building over the past few days,'' he said.   There was no confirmation of casualties, but neighbors of theheadquarters in Panama City told The Associated Press there weredead and wounded.   The U.S. Southern Command put its troops and civilians on DeltaAlert, its highest level of readiness.   U.S. troops in combat gear took up positions only 600 yards fromthe barracks, which is in downtown Panama City near the canal. TheU.S. Southern Command has installations at Fort Amador and QuarryHeights, less than a mile from the barracks. The Pentagon said noU.S. troops were involved in shooting.   A U.S. military jet and helicopter gunships were seen in thearea, but apparently were only observing the action and did notparticipate.   Shooting began with a few bursts of fire shortly around 7 a.m.(8 a.m. EDT) and was continuing more than three hours later.   Neighbors, who insisted on not being identified, said they heardsmall arms being fired and bursts of automatic weapons.   Neighbors and reporters saw three ambulances leave theheadquarters compound.   Journalists were kept more than 100 yards away by police, backedby Panamanian armored personnel carriers and water-cannon trucks.Vehicle traffic to the headquarters compound was also blocked bythe military.   Armed men in civilian clothes surrounded the Department ofNational Investigations, Panama's political police, located about500 yards from the headquarters.   In Washington, the Pentagon said gunfire had been heard byforces at the Southern Command and Americans were told to avoiddangerous areas.   There are about 12,000 U.S. troops stationed in Panama, many ofthem within five miles of Panama City. All U.S. civilian dependentswere moved onto U.S. military installations as of July 1 in thewake of violence that followed Panamanian elections held on May 7.   Noriega, Panama's de facto leader, assumed command of themilitary in 1983. The United States has been trying to oust Noriegasince he was indicted on U.S. drug charges in February 1988.Noriega says the drug charges are part of a U.S. plot to abrogatethe Panama Canal treaties and retain control of the canal at theend of the century.   U.S. efforts to oust Noriega have focused on encouraging thecivilian opposition and on attempting to undercut his support inthe military, encouraging members of the Defense Forces to ask himto leave or oust him by force.   Efforts by the United States to remove him, including economicsanctions against Panama, have failed.</TEXT></DOC>
