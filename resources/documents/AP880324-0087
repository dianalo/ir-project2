LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This impoverished Mississippi Rivercity has no money today, and may have no choice but to seekprotection in bankruptcy court, says an attorney who garnished allof the city's funds to pay part of a $3.4 million judgment.   ``They can file a petition for bankruptcy with the federalcourt, and a trustee can be appointed,'' said Clyde Kuehn, attorneyfor a city jail inmate who suffered permanent brain damage when hewas beaten by another prisoner.   East St. Louis Treasurer Charlotte Moore said there was about$800,000 in city accounts when the documents were served Wednesday.She said about $85,000 in payroll and vendor checks are outstandingand apparently cannot be cashed.   ``My real interest right now is payroll. That's critical,'' saidAlderman Melvin Frierson. ``It's bad that it happened, but it was abad situation that caused the lawsuit, too.''   The city's next pay day is March 30.   Mayor Carl E. Officer declined comment.   The judgment _ now about $4 million with interest _ was awardedin 1985 to Walter DeBow, a Granite City man who suffered permanentbrain damage in a beating in the East St. Louis jail in January1984.   DeBow was arrested for driving with an open bottle of maltliquor. He was placed in a cell with a man who was being held onmisdemeanor charges but had a history of violent crime. Kuehn saidthe man beat DeBow so severely that he suffered permanent braindamage and will require medical care for the rest of his life.   In November, the Illinois Supreme Court ordered the city to paythe judgment, clearing the way for Kuehn and the DeBow family toseize the city's bank accounts by filing the garnishment documents.   The garnishment affected city funds held in banks, and fines andtaxes collected by St. Clair County.   ``As far as the people of East St. Louis are concerned, thisisn't going to hurt the citizens any more than they already are,''Kuehn said. ``They already don't get their trash picked up. Theyalready have a fire department and police department that isn'tproperly equipped.   ``Perhaps if they go into bankruptcy and a trustee is appointedand starts making decisions, the people of the city will even bebetter off,'' Kuehn said.</TEXT></DOC>
