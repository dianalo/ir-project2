Ischemic-zone myocardial phosphocreatine (PCr), adenosine triphophate(ATP), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and pH were measured and the PCr/ATPand Pi/PCr ratios were calculated at baseline and for 6 hours after coroniaryartery occlusion with (n = 12) or without (n = 10) reperfusion for 1hour; eight animals underwent sham occlusion. The six MR spectroscopyparameters were usd to develop criteria for separating normal from ischemic,ischemic from reperfused, and normal from reperfused myocardium. Theaccuracies of these dichotomizations were 96.1%, 97.1%, and 85.1%, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
