Moreover, NCR plans to provide cross-language translation sothat objects can automatically rewrite themselves from language to languageas they move from environment to environment.andP;  (Most other systemsconcentrate on sending messages; Cooperation, because of its objectmarshaling, is able to send objects, not just pointers or references or datastreams, around with ease.)andM;NCR has been joined in its submission by Object Design Inc. (see Release 1.0,9-90).andP;  Cooperation can use ODI's ObjectStore OODB for superior performancewhere clustering (efficient storage) of small-grained object structures isappropriate.andP;  ObjectStore also brings transaction management and a niceversioning system to the party, says Hazeltine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
