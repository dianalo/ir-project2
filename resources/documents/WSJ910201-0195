The Office of Bank Supervision and Examination attributedthe slower growth to reduced income from stock trading andloan services.</LP><TEXT>   Seoul's stock market remained bearish in 1990, as its keyindex fell about 23%. The banks' loan revenues declinedsharply last year because of cuts in loan interest rates inlate 1989.   Local banks also were hurt by their loans to threeinvestment trust firms in late 1989. The banks were asked bythe government to provide a total of 2.8 trillion won inloans to the trust firms to prop up the sagging stock market.A large number of these loans are overdue because of themarket's continued sluggishness.   South Korea's five largest commercial banks -- Hanil Bank,Korea First Bank, Chohung Bank, Commercial Bank of Korea andBank of Seoul -- posted a 3.6% decline in combined pretaxprofits. Ten regional commercial banks, by contrast, had a53% increase in total gross profits, largely because of theirlarge capital increases.   Among the 18 commercial banks, Chohung Bank had thelargest gross profit, 179.6 billion won, followed by KoreaFirst Bank, Hanil Bank, Shinhan Bank and Commercial Bank ofKorea. Shinhan Bank reported the largest net income, with99.2 billion won, followed by Hanil Bank, Korea First Bank,Chohung Bank and Commercial Bank of Korea.   Shinhan's surge to the top position in net from fourthplace in 1989 came as a major surprise. Shinhan, establishedin 1982, is South Korea's sixth largest bank in terms ofcapitalization and has a relatively small branch network, butit outpaced others with its innovative management style,analysts said.   Analysts predicted that growing competition fromnonbanking financial institutions and foreign competitorswill continue to undermine South Korean banks' profitabilitythis year.</TEXT></DOC>
