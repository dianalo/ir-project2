Gold prices posted modest gains in U.S. trading.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current deliveryfinished at $372.40 a troy ounce, $1 higher than Thursday'ssettlement. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of$372.25 for an ounce of bullion at 4 p.m. EDT, up from Thursday'slate bid of $370.85.   Currency dealers said the dollar withstood some early selling inthe aftermath of remarks by Federal Reserve Board Chairman AlanGreenspan indicating that the central bank's highest priority nowis to prevent a recession.   In his midyear report on the economy to Congress, Greenspanimplied that the Fed would push down interest rates if necessary toprevent what he termed an ``unnecessary and destructive'' recession.   But Greenspan's comments were open to numerous interpretations,dealers said. According to one view, the Fed might think it alreadyhas done enough to enliven the economy, which in recent months hassent out sluggish signals.   If this is true, the central bank might not want to drive downinterest rates any further until it determines whether the economyneeds extra stimulation. Falling U.S. interest rates tend to reducedemand for dollars.   A huge weekly increase in a broad measure of the nation's moneysupply raised speculation that Fed actions in recent weeks haveprovided significant economic stimulation.   The Fed reported late Thursday that the money measure known asM2 jumped $17.5 billion in the week ended July 10. M2 includes allmoney readily available for spending, such as cash and travelerschecks, plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutualfunds.   ``Fears that the Fed is going to be easing considerably wereeased by the M2 number,'' said Brady Benson, a currency marketanalyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   In currency trading abroad, the dollar had a mixed showing. Latein European trading, the dollar recovered ground as tradersadjusted their currency holdings ahead of Sunday's elections forabout half of the seats in Japan's Parliament, dealers said.   In Tokyo, the dollar eased to 142.15 Japanese yen from 142.33yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, the dollar slippedfurther to 141.90 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 141.85yen, up from 141.40 yen late Thursday.   The British pound came under selling pressure in anticipation ofchanges in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's cabinet. In London,the pound fell to $1.6185 from $1.6273 late Thursday. In New Yorkit cost $1.6187 to buy one pound, compared to Thursday's exchangerate of $1.6230.
