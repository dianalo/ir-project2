Certain Transfers of Nonperforming Assets</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Facts:</T3> A financial institution desires to reduce its nonaccrualor reduced rate loans and other nonearning assets, including foreclosedreal estate (collectively, ``nonperforming assets''). Some or all of suchnonperforming assets are transferred to a newly-formed entity (the ``newentity''). The financial institution, as consideration for transferringthe nonperforming assets, may receive (a) the cash proceeds of debt issuedby the new entity to third parties, (b) a note or other redeemable instrumentissued by the new entity, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b). The residualequity interests in the new entity, which carry voting rights, initiallyowned by the financial institution, are transferred to outsiders (for example,via distribution to the financial institution's shareholders or sale orcontribution to an unrelated third party).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The financial institution typically will manage the assets for a fee,providing necessary services to liquidate the assets, but otherwise doesnot have the right to appoint directors or legally control the operationsof the new entity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question 1:</T3> What factors should be considered in determining whethersuch transfer of nonperforming assets can be accounted for as a dispositionby the financial institution?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Interpretive Response:</T3> The staff believes that determining whethernonperforming assets have been disposed of in substance requires an assessmentas to whether the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">SAB Topic 5-E \1\<NOTE/> discusses some factors that the staff believes should beconsidered in determining whether the risks of a business have been transferred.Consistent with the factors discussed in SAB Topic 5-E, the staff believesthat the transfer described should not be accounted for as a sale or dispositionif (a) the transfer of nonperforming assets to the new entity providesfor recourse by the new entity to the transferor financial institution,(b) the financial institution directly or indirectly guarantees debt ofthe new entity in whole or in part, (c) the financial institution retainsa participation in the rewards of ownership of the transferred assets,for example through a higher than normal incentive or other managementfee arrangement,\2\<NOTE/> or (d) the fair value of any material non-cash considerationreceived by the financial institution (for example, a note or other redeemableinstrument) cannot be reasonably estimated. Additionally, the staff believesthat the accounting for the transfer as a sale or disposition generallyis not appropriate where the financial institution retains rewards of ownershipthrough the holding of significant residual equity interests or where thirdparty holders of such interests do not have a significant amount of capitalat risk.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ SAB Topic 5-E, ``Accounting for Divestiture of a Subsidiaryor Other Business Operation,'' addresses the accounting for the transferof certain operations whereby there is a continuing involvement by theseller or other evidence that incidents of ownership remain with the seller.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The staff recognizes that the determination of whetherthe financial institution retains a participation in the rewards of ownershipwill require an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individualtransaction. Generally, the staff believes that, in order to conclude thatthe financial institution has disposed of the assets in substance, themanagement fee arrangement should not enable the financial institutionto participate to any significant extent in the potential increases incash flows or value of the assets, and the terms of the arrangement, includingprovisions for discontinuance of services, must be substantially similarto management arrangements with third parties.<ITAG tagnum="21">Where accounting for the transfer as a sale or disposition is notappropriate, the nonperforming assets should remain on the financial institution'sbalance sheet and should continue to be disclosed as nonaccrual, past due,restructured or foreclosed, as appropriate, and the debt of the new entityshould be recorded by the financial institution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question 2:</T3> If the transaction is accounted for as a sale, atwhat value should the transfer be recorded by the financial institution?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Interpretive Response:</T3> The staff believes that the transfer shouldbe recorded by the financial institution at the fair value of assets transferred(or, if more clearly evident, the fair value of assets received) and aloss recognized by the financial institution for any excess of the netcarrying value \3\<NOTE/> over the fair value.\4\<NOTE/> Fair value is the amount that would be realizable in an outrightsale to an unrelated third party for cash.\5\<NOTE/> Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, ``Accountingby Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings,'' and FinancialReporting Release No. 28 (Section 401.09 of the Financial Reporting Codification)discuss the determination of fair value of formally or substantively repossessedcollateral. The same concepts should be applied in determining fair valueof the transferred assets, i.e., if an active market exists for the assetstransferred, then fair value is equal to the market value. If no activemarket exists, but one exists for similar assets, the selling prices inthat market may be helpful in estimating the fair value. If no such marketprice is available, a forecast of expected cash flows, discounted at arate commensurate with the risks involved, may be used to aid in estimatingthe fair value. In situations where discounted cash flows are used to estimatefair value of nonperforming assets, the staff would expect that the interestrate used in such computations will be substantially higher than the costof funds of the financial institution and appropriately reflect the riskof holding these nonperforming assets. Therefore, the fair value determinedin such a way will be lower than the amount at which the assets would havebeen carried by the financial institution had the transfer not occurred,unless the financial institution had been required under generally acceptedaccounting principles to carry such assets at market value or the lowerof cost or market value. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The carrying value should be reduced by any allocableallowance for credit losses or other valuation allowances. The staff believesthat the loss recognized for the excess of the net carrying value overthe fair value should be considered a credit loss and thus should not beincluded by the financial institution as loss on disposition.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The staff notes that the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force(EITF) reached a consensus at its November 17, 1988 meeting on Issue 88-25that the newly created ``liquidating bank'' should continue to report itsassets and liabilities at fair values at the date of the financial statements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensusat its May 21, 1987 meeting on Issue No. 87-17, ``Spin-off or other distributionsof loans receivable to shareholders,'' that an enterprise that distributesloans to its owners should report such distribution at fair value.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question 3:</T3> Where the transaction may appropriately be accountedfor as a sale and the financial institution receives a note receivableor other redeemable instrument from the new entity, how should such assetbe disclosed pursuant to Item III C, ``Risk Elements,'' of Industry Guide3? What factors should be considered related to the subsequent accountingfor such instruments received? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Interpretive Response:</T3> The staff believes that the financial institutionmay exclude the note receivable or other asset from its Risk Elements disclosuresunder Guide 3 provided that: (a) the receivable itself does not constitutea nonaccrual, past due, restructured, or potential problem loan that wouldrequire disclosure under Guide 3, and (b) the underlying collateral isdescribed in sufficient detail to enable investors to understand the natureof the note receivable or other asset if material, including the extentof any over-collateralization. The description of the collateral normallywould include material information similar to that which would be providedif such assets were owned by the financial institution, including pertinentRisk Element disclosures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The staff notes that, in situations in which the transaction is accountedfor as a sale and a portion of the consideration received by the registrantis debt or another redeemable instrument, careful consideration must begiven to the appropriateness of recording profits on the management feearrangement, or interest or dividends on the instrument received, includingconsideration of whether it is necessary to defer such amounts or to treatsuch payments on a cost recovery basis. Further, if the new entity incurslosses to the point that its permanent equity based on generally acceptedaccounting principles is eliminated, it would ordinarily be necessary forthe financial institution, at a minimum, to record further operating lossesas its best estimate of the loss in realizable value of its investment.\6\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Typically, the financial institution's claim on the newentity is subordinate to other debt instruments and thus the financialinstitution will incur any losses beyond those incurred by the permanentequity holders.<ITAG tagnum="74">Topic 11: Miscellaneous Disclosure</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">N. Disclosures of the Impact of Assistance from Federal FinancialInstitution Regulatory Agencies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Facts:</T3> An entity receives financial assistance from a federalregulatory agency in conjunction with either an acquisition of a troubledfinancial institution, transfer of nonperforming assets to a newly-formedentity, or other reorganization. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question:</T3> What are the disclosure implications of the existenceof regulatory assistance? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Interpretive Response:</T3> The staff believes that users of financialstatements must be able to assess the impact of credit and other riskson a company following a regulatory assisted acquisition, transfer or otherreorganization on a basis comparable to that disclosed by other institutions,i.e., as if the assistance did not exist. In this regard, the staff believesthat the amount of regulatory assistance should be disclosed separatelyand should be separately identified in the statistical information furnishedpursuant to Industry Guide 3, to the extent it impacts such information.\1\<NOTE/>\2\<NOTE/> Further, the nature, extent and impact of such assistanceneeds to be fully discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis.\3\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The staff has previously expressed its views regardingacceptable methods of compliance with this principle in the minutes ofEITF Issue 88-19, and an announcement by the SEC Observer to the EITF atthe February 23, 1989 meeting.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Paragraph 9 of Statement of Financial Accounting StandardsNo. 72, ``Accounting for Certain Acquisitions of Banking or Thrift Institutions,''addresses the recording of regulatory assistance at the date of a purchasebusiness combination and indicates that, ``[i]f receipt of the assistanceis probable and the amount is reasonably estimable, that portion of thecost of the acquired enterprise shall be assigned to such assistance.''In addition, see Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 88-19 for guidance onthe appropriate period in which to record certain types of regulatory assistance.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ See andSection; 501.06.c., ``Effects of Federal FinancialAssistance Upon Operations,'' of the Financial Reporting Codification forfurther discussion of the Management's Discussion and Analysis disclosuresof the effects of regulatory assistance.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-16316 Filed 7-11-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 8010-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
