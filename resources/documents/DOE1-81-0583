<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-81-0583 </DOCNO><TEXT>We investigate the behavior of steady state, cellular flames. The specificproblem studied is that of a flame stabilized by a line source of gaseousfuel. Thus, the source is located at the origin of a polar coordinatesystem in two dimensions. The investigation is carried out by numericallysolving the equations of the diffusional thermal model describing suchflames. The numerical method is based on a pseudo-spectral Fourier methodin the angular direction. In the radial direction, we adapt the coordinatesystem by minimizing a newly developed functional of the solution. Wefind that this permits a dramatic reduction in the number of radial collocationpoints required. 7 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
