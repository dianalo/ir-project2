Gorbachev said a U.S.-Soviet treatyreducing long-range nuclear weapons could be signed by January butthat he will not set aside disputes over the ``Star Wars'' programto reach such an accord.   The Soviet leader also said his policy of ``glasnost,'' oropenness, includes freedom of speech, but he condemned a leadingdissident as a ``parasite'' and accused him of ``sponging on thedemocratic process.''   Gorbachev's comments came in a pre-summit interview with twoAmerican news organizations. The Soviet news agency Tass on Sundayran a partial transcript of the interview with The Washington Postand Newsweek.   Radio Moscow's English-language foreign service also carried areport about it as its lead item on Sunday. Soviet television'swidely watched evening news program ``Vremya'' mentioned as itslead item that the interview had been published in Washington andwould appear in today's Soviet newspapers.   The 90-minute discussion, in which Gorbachev also proposed ajoint U.S.-Soviet trip to Mars, covered a wide range of foreign anddomestic issues.   The interview, conducted in the Kremlin on Wednesday, produced astartling Biblical reference by the head of the officiallyatheistic state.   When asked about how far glasnost should go and about criticismof dictator Josef V. Stalin, the 57-year-old Communist Party leadersaid:   ``Jesus Christ alone knew answers to all questions and knew howto feed 20,000 Jews with five loaves of bread. We don't possessthat skill, we have no ready prescription to solve all our problemsquickly.''   The interview was conducted 11 days before President Reagan'sarrival in Moscow for a five-day summit with Gorbachev. It will betheir fourth meeting.   Although the Tass transcript included much of the interview, itdeleted a reference to Yegor Ligachev, the Kremlin's No. 2 man. Italso left out a reference to Gorbachev's wife, Raisa.   Ligachev, considered more conservative than the Soviet leader,reportedly wants to slow Gorbachev's policy of ``perestroika,'' orrestructuring, of the Soviet economy and society.   Gorbachev acknowledged a lively debate between the two but said``to present these discussions _ which are a normal part of thedemocratic process _ as division within the leadership would be agreat mistake itself.''   Gorbachev expressed optimism that a superpower agreement to cutstrategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons will be completed by thetime Reagan leaves office in January. ``We want to have thatsigned,'' he said.   If the agreement ``comes to be drafted under the present U.S.administration, I see no reason why President Reagan and I shouldnot sign it. I would certainly welcome that,'' Gorbachev added.   However, he cautioned that he has no plans to set aside disputesto hasten an agreement. ``If we sign with one hand a treatyreducing strategic offensive forces in one area and at the sametime launch an arms race in space or at sea, what would be thepoint? That would be senseless,'' he said.   He reiterated his opposition to Reagan's ``Star Wars'' missiledefense program, known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, sayingthe leader who promotes an escalation of the arms race in space``is committing a crime against the people _ his own people, andothers.''   U.S. and Soviet officials have said they don't believe thelong-range nuclear weapons treaty will be completed by the end ofReagan's term.   Another treaty to ban short- and medium-range nuclear weapons isbeing debated by the U.S. Senate.   Gorbachev said he will ask Reagan at the summit to approve ajoint Soviet-U.S. unmanned flight to Mars. ``Why shouldn't we worktogether? We have great experience, you have great experience _ letus cooperate to master the cosmos, to fulfill big programs,'' hesaid.   On domestic affairs, Gorbachev was asked whether glasnostincludes freedom of speech. ``While freedom of speech isindispensable for glasnost, we see glasnost as a broaderphenomenon,'' he said.   Glasnost is ``the right of every citizen to openly say what heor she thinks about all social and political questions,'' he added.   Gorbachev was asked later whether freedom of speech applies todissidents such as Moscow journalist Sergei Grigoryants, who wasjailed for a week earlier this month. Gorbachev said Soviets thinkof Grigoryants ``as some kind of alien phenomenon in our societysponging on the democratic process.''   Gorbachev went on to call Grigoryants a ``parasite.'' It was arare reference by a Soviet leader to a dissident.   Grigoryants, editor of the dissident magazine Glasnost, said thecomputer and printer used to produce the journal were confiscatedwhen he was arrested.   In a telephone interview on Sunday, he called Gorbachev'scomments about him ``very unpleasant.''</TEXT></DOC>
