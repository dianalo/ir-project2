A decade after Khomeini led the Islamic revolution to power inIran, many of the country's senior figures are seeking greaterfreedom and an end to Iran's political and economic isolation.Factions also are jockeying for power, trying to position themselvesto take over after Khomeini leaves the scene.   But the frail, 88-year-old ayatollah seized on the unlikely issueof Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' to reassert his primacyover the secular and liberal forces gathering momentum in Iran.   His thunderbolt shocked many in the West. The decree that anauthor in the late 20th century be put to death for a work offiction reverberated from European foreign ministries to FifthAvenue bookstores that stocked the novel.   Diplomatic envoys were recalled, and writers marched in New Yorkand signed protests in Europe.   A price of more than $5 million was put on Rushdie's head by twoIranian clerics. The author fled to a safe hiding place and issuedan apology for sections of the book that could be consideredblasphemy of the prophet Mohammed.   A stern and unforgiving Khomeini rejected any apology and renewedhis call for Rushdie's blood. He also denounced his own domesticfoes. ``As long as I am alive I will not let the state fall into thehands of liberals,'' Khomeini vowed in a statement Wednesday.   The ayatollah chose the issue and the timing of his assault.   Controversy simmered over ``The Satanic Verses'' for months. InOctober, the book was banned in India, the country of Rushdie'sbirth. Demonstrations were staged against the novel in othercountries. On Feb. 12, six people were killed in Pakistan during aprotest over publication of the book in the United States. Two dayslater Khomeini issued his condemnation.   On the face of it, Khomeini's statement dramatically pointed to asharp swing back to revolutionary radicalism.   Six months after an Aug. 20 cease-fire halted the war with Iraq,the Iranian leadership is openly split. Khomeini sides withhardliners who oppose demands for reforms in the country'spolitical, social and religious life.   How far he will push that course is anyone's guess. Khomeini inthe past has used extremism and allegations of Western conspiraciesagainst Iran and Islam to crush internal discord and rouserevolutionary zeal when he sees it flagging.   The government has been paralyzed to a large degree by competingpower blocs whose rivalry had been masked by the need for a unitedfront during the traumatizing 8-year war with Iraq.   So-called pragmatists led by Parliament Speaker HashemiRafsanjani have been seeking to end Iran's isolation and modernizeits economy.   Opposing them is a curious mix of revolutionary anti-Westernhardliners, such as Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and InteriorMinister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, and a group of conservative clericswho bitterly resist change.   ``We expected the situation would improve after the cease-fire,but instead it has become worse,'' said a Western-trained Iraniandoctor, echoing what appeared to be widespread sentiments. He spokewith a reporter on condition he not be identified.   With the end of the fighting, some leaders have questioned whatthe revolution has achieved and blamed government inefficiency asmuch as the war for the hardships most Iranians face.   The strongest criticism came from Ayatollah Ali-HusseinMontazeri, Khomeini's designated successor.   He called for a candid re-evaluation of the revolution'sachievements and stressed the need ``to make up for past mistakes.''   ``People in the world got the idea that our business in Iran wasmurdering people,'' he added, in an apparent reference to reportsthat thousands of dissidents have been executed by the regime inrecent months.   Montazeri declared that ``instead of safeguarding the values ofthe revolution we shouted slogans. Instead of providing value to thepeople, we only made more and more of the intelligent and activepeople more and more disgruntled and isolated.''   Some Iranians had seen Montazeri's criticism as a sign ofimminent liberalization after 10 difficult years in which therevolution survived bloody internal strife, the war andinternational hostility.   Khomeini's bitter denunciation of liberal trends and criticism ofthe leadership dashed those hopes.   The powerful ``bazaaris,'' the wealthy Tehran merchants who stillhave a strong hold on the economy, have questioning the sincerity ofthe liberalization process.   ``They admit their mistakes, but they never do anything tocorrect them and the biggest mistake is the continuation of themullahs (clerics) in office,'' one prominent merchant said.   Nonetheless, Khomeini freed thousands of prisoners in a generalamnesty earlier this month and has permitted the formation ofpolitical parties under legislation shelved during the war. Howfreely those parties will be able to operate is questionable.   On the economic front, Iran faces a massive reconstruction thatofficials estimate will cost at least $400 billion. Shortages of rawmaterials, because of import restrictions to save foreign currency,have left hundreds of factories operating at 30 or 40 percent ofcapacity.   The main shopping precincts are crowded with bargain-huntersuntil late in the evening, even when whole city blocks are suddenlyplunged into darkness by the frequent electricity cuts.   The mounting problems have left Iran's 50 million peopleuncertain of their future and hungry for better days after all thehardship and heartbreak.</TEXT><NOTE>End Advance</NOTE></DOC>
