The neutron detector consists of a liquid scintillator (phi105x 50mm) and a XP-2040 photomultiplier. The efficiencies of the neutrondetector is determined by n-p scattering experiment and the calculationusing Monte Carlo method. A plastic film (4.5 {mu}m in thick) is usedto record the fragments. The data is fitted to a Maxwellian distributionand the result of T = 1.418 +- 0.15 MeV is obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
