After plunging early in the day, some 30-year Treasury bonds staged a powerful rally in highly volatile trading, winding up with gains of half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount, from Friday's closing levels. Nevertheless, prices still are about 11 1/2% lower than they were only about a month ago, when the dollar went into a tailspin, rekindling inflation fear as well as concern that foreign investors would stop buying U.S. bonds.    At one stage early yesterday before the dollar had recovered, the latest 30-year Treasury bond's yield surged to nearly 8 7/8%. It later fell to 8.64% from 8.7% Friday. As recently as March 26, this issue yielded only 7.55%. Precious metal prices also staged a big reversal, with gold prices first soaring through midmorning and then later plunging.    The catalyst for the turnaround in the dollar, bonds and commodities, as well as stocks, was a White House spokesman's statement that further declines in the dollar could be &quot;counterproductive.&quot; Several analysts said they were surprised that such a seemingly bland remark could have such a big impact, especially as it amounted to a mere repetition of recent comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker. But others said the statement was encouraging because it indicated more unity within the administration on stabilizing the dollar.    Traders' obsession with the dollar is especially intense this week because the Treasury is scheduled to announce details tomorrow afternoon of its huge quarterly financing operation. The financing is expected to total between $27 billion and $29 billion of three-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds, all to be sold next week.    Worries that Japanese investors will avoid the Treasury financing have been weighing on the credit markets for several weeks. But Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York, contends those fears will prove unjustified. He argued that the difference between U.S. and Japanese interest rates has widened so much recently that Japanese investors will find dollar-denominated bonds too tempting to resist.    The difference in yield between 10-year Treasury notes and comparable Japanese securities now stands at more than five percentage points, Mr. Chandross said. &quot;Even if Japanese investors expect the exchange rate to move against them over the life of their investment, they are more than compensated for that by the interest rate differential,&quot; he said.    Mr. Chandross estimated that the Treasury financing will total $27.5 billion. That would consist of $9.5 billion of three-year notes, $9.25 billion of 10-year notes and $8.75 billion of 30-year bonds.    Much to the dismay of would-be home buyers, the bond market's turmoil in the past month has led to extraordinarily sharp increases in home mortgage rates. Rates continued to rise last week, although at a much slower pace than the previous week.    Mortgage lenders last week were asking an average of 10.47% on conventional, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, according to a survey by HSH Associates, a Riverdale, N.J., publisher of mortgage information. That was up from 10.29% the week before and 9.5% the week before that. As recently as the week ended March 27, the national average was only 9.09%, said Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH Associates.    Rates on adjustable mortgages have remained relatively low, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Lenders last week were asking an average of 7.66% for the first year of conventional Treasury-indexed, 30-year adjustable-rate mortgages, compared with 7.67% the week before. &quot;Adjustable rates have hardly moved at all lately, so we expect to see more interest in them from consumers,&quot; said Mr. Havemann.    The bond market's rally yesterday came despite increases in most short-term interest rates. For example, the closely watched interest rate on federal funds rose to an average of about 6.53% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.29% Friday.    Recent increases in the funds rate probably have been engineered by the Federal Reserve, according to a growing number of analysts. They say the Fed has tightened its credit hold slightly in an effort to help strengthen the dollar and remind investors of its determination to combat inflation.    Some economists predict the Fed will go a step further and raise its discount rate if the dollar shows additional signs of weakness. The discount rate, which is the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions, stands at 5 1/2%.    Interest rates also rose yesterday on short-term Treasury bills at the government's regular weekly auction. The average rate on new 13-week Treasury bills increased slightly to 5.79% from last week's auction average of 5.77%. The average rate on new 26-week Treasury bills surged to 6.14% from 6% at last week's sale.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 rose to 87 27/32 from 87 11/32 last Friday, while the yield fell to 8.64% from 8.7%. The issue traded as low as 85 30/32 and as high as 88 28/32. As recently as March 26, this issue was quoted at 99 3/8, where the yield was 7.55%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 rose to 92 14/32 from 92 1/8, while the yield declined to 8.42% from 8.47%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 8.70 points to close at 1285.93. The high for the day was 1293.83, while the low was 1256.91. That was one of the largest one-day ranges since Shearson began the index in 1981, said a Shearson official.    The bond market's recovery partly reflected a technical rebound, several analysts said. &quot;Bonds had collapsed too far, too fast,&quot; said Roger A. Froehlich, president of Technical Dimensions, a Mount Kisco, N.Y., bond market forecasting and advisory service. &quot;The market was primed for a correction.&quot;    Here are details of the government's regular weekly auction of short-term Treasury bills:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                               13-Week           26-Week   Applications ........ $21,941,650,000   $22,817,385,000   Accepted bids ........ $6,605,030,000    $6,607,505,000   Accepted at low price             97%               76%   Accepted noncompet'ly  $1,084,540,000      $775,855,000   Average price (Rate)   98.536 (5.79%)    96.896 (6.14%)   High price (Rate) .... 98.549 (5.74%)    96.916 (6.10%)   Low price (Rate) ..... 98.531 (5.81%)    96.886 (6.16%)   Coupon equivalent ....          5.98%             6.44%   Both issues are dated April 30.
