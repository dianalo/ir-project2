(VHSIChardware description language models tested)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Meyer, Ernest.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>An interoperability test was conducted on three VHSIC hardwaredescription language (VHDL) models: a 5-bit counter, a sodamachine controller and a random logic block with no specificfunction.andP;  Cadence Design Systems' VDOC 454 ($10,000) was used togenerate correct-by-construction VHDL code from Verilogdescriptions of behavior and structure.andP;  Cadence Advanced CAE DivPres Prabhu Goel challenged other vendor to show correctsimulation results from the three models the company supplied, butCLSI Exec Mark Steffler points out that VHDL code generated byautomatic translation programs such as VDOC 454 never will run asquickly as handwritten models.andP;  The three models were validated byCadence on simulators from Intermetrics and Microelectronic andComputer Technology Corp; companies participating in the challengeincluded CLSI, Vista Technologies and Zycad.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Cadence Design Systems Inc.
