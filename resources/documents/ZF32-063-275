MoserandM;Providing greater control over applications developed with Microsoft Corp.'sQuickC for Windows is the aim of new Windows tools Microsoft plans to ship atthe end of the month.andM;Slated to hit the streets at the same time as QuickC for Windows, Microsoft's$149.95 tool set contains a Windows help compiler, the Microsoft CodeViewdebugger for Windows, the Windows Debugging Version and several other Windowstools.andM;The tool set is designed to hasten the development process by replacing therelatively cumbersome combination of C and the Windows Software DevelopmentKit (SDK).andM;Joe Modica, a principal at Sheridan Software Systems Inc., a Windows softwaredeveloper and consulting firm in Melville, N.Y., said he expects that usingQuickC for Windows and the additional tools will garner him a 5 percent to 30percent time savings in generating applications.andM;&quot;What you find with developing a Windows application in a DOS-based tool isthat you are constantly bouncing back and forth between environments,&quot; Modicasaid.andP;  &quot;Where we will use QuickC is in quickly developing the up-front workin Windows.andP;  Even a 1 percent time savings is valuable if you don't have togive up anything to gain it.&quot;andM;The additional tools, which will be available separately from the QuickCproduct, are not necessary for developing QuickC for Windows applications.andP;  AWindows help compiler will aid developers in providing on-line help in theirown Windows-based applications.andM;The Microsoft CodeView debugger for Windows will let QuickC users debugDynamic Data Exchange (DDE) sessions and will allow for dual monitordebugging as well.andM;Tools for handling such Windows debugging issues as monitoring systemmessages and analyzing how applications use memory will be incorporated fromthe Windows SDK.andP;  The Windows Debugging Version, also found in the WindowsSDK, will provide error checking for Windows code and will allow developersto track calls from their application to the Windows environment.andM;A stripped-down tool set priced at $49.95 is also available.andP;  It includes allthe additional tools except the Windows Debugging Version, which is availableseparately, priced at $99.andP;  The Windows help compiler is also availableseparately, for a shipping and handling fee.andM;Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., can be reached at (206) 882-8080.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
