At issue is a lucrative 25-year concession to install andoperate three million telephone lines in the country. Acontract for the concession, tentatively awarded to CPTelecommunications Co. last October, was ready for signingwhen a military junta ousted the elected government of PrimeMinister Chatichai Choonhavan in a bloodless coup on Feb. 23.</LP><TEXT>   Now, the civilian-led government installed by the junta isattempting to alter terms of the concession, which someofficials charge would give CP Telecom, a subsidiary of thepowerful Charoen Pokphand agro-industrial group, a virtualmonopoly over Thailand's telephone system for the next 25years. But government efforts to alter the concession aremeeting stiff resistance from CP executives and some membersof the military junta.   The case provides a test of how much power Mr. Anand'sinterim government actually wields in decision-making. Italso will show how effectively the government can implementits policy of eliminating monopolies, which long haveprovided lucrative niches for well-connected businessinterests.   Compromise between government officials and CP would provea major victory for Mr. Anand's administration, politicalanalysts say. But if negotiations fail, the deal could bescrapped, perhaps precipitating a government crisis anddelaying the badly needed telephone project while a new roundof bidding is held.   &quot;I hope they can reach some kind of compromise, because ifthey don't, it will have a serious impact on investorconfidence,&quot; says a stock analyst. The stock market in recentweeks has performed sluggishly, in part because of rumorsthat some cabinet ministers may be ousted over the telephonedispute.   So far, compromise has been elusive. Tension over whowould ultimately rule on the project began even before Mr.Anand's government was formed and has escalated steadilysince.   Soon after the February coup, military officers attemptedto bring the Ministry of Transport and Communications, whichcontrols many of Thailand's large infrastructure projects,under direct military control. But later, Mr. Anand succeededin maneuvering his favored candidate, Nukul Prachuabmoh, abusinessman and former central bank governor, into the topspot at the ministry. One senior civil servant and twomilitary officers serve as deputy ministers.   A review committee charged with evaluating the project byMay 17 was disbanded in disarray because of differencesbetween military and civilian members. In late May, ahigher-level committee chaired by Mr. Nukul was given chargeof the review. Last week, the cabinet approved Mr. Nukul'splan to limit CP's concession and allow other companies toparticipate in strengthening Thailand's telecommunicationsnetwork.   But that plan has met resistance from CP and last weekprompted a public attack by Deputy Communications Ministerand Army Chief-of-Staff Viros Saengsanit. In response, PrimeMinister Anand announced he would personally take charge ofthe contract negotiations. A first round of talks between Mr.Anand, Mr. Nukul's committee and CP officials on Tuesdayfailed to produce any agreement. Though Mr. Anand has playeddown civilian-military rifts over the project and saysnegotiations will continue, he also has warned that the talksmay be scrapped if CP refuses to budge.   If the project goes through as approved by the previousgovernment, the Telephone Organization of Thailand, the stateenterprise operating the country's domestic telephoneservice, &quot;would be bankrupt within 10 years, and in the end,CP would have total control of the telephone system inThailand,&quot; says a government official involved with theproject. &quot;We want to be fair to CP and allow them to get achunk of the cake, since they've done a lot of work already.But they can't eat the cake alone.&quot;   CP officials say the government is attempting to imposeunworkable conditions on the project in an effort to forcethe company to void the deal outright. In particular, theycite a government proposal to divide Thailand into fourtelecommunications zones, allowing CP Telecom to install andoperate telephones in half of the total area.   Thailand's telephone system has long been among thecountry's major infrastructure worries. Currently, thecountry has only 1.4 million phone lines.</TEXT></DOC>
