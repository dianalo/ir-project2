The announcement would mark the electronics company's entry into the highly competitive, but growing minisupercomputer market.    Gould's chairman and chief executive officer, James F. McDonald, said he expects these products to account for about 20% of the company's computer sales in 1988. For 1986, computers accounted for about one-third of Gould's total sales of $908.8 million, a spokesman said.    The new high-performance computers, priced between $395,000 and $2.9 million, will be marketed mostly for engineering and scientific applications, Mr. McDonald said.    The models are much faster than any computers Gould currently makes and have a performance range from 12 million instructions to 100 million instructions per second.    The company's competitors in the new minisupercomputer market include Littleton, Mass.-based Alliant Computer Systems Corp. and Convex Computer Corp. of Richardson, Texas. </TEXT></DOC>
