Now, Carey must face R.V.Durham, the union's chief negotiator and by far the top vote-getter, andWalter Shea, a longtime assistant to several Teamsters presidents, who werealso nominated Thursday for the top post of North America's largest union.;   Durham captured 1,001 votes. Shea had 574 votes and Carey got 289 to earnballot spots. Candidates needed to receive 5 percent of the 1,904 votes cast,or 96 votes, to be on the ballot for December's final vote.;    Lou Riga,leader of the San Jose local, failed to get the minimum.;    Labor experts andreform delegates say that such an open nomination could hardly have beenimagined a few months ago in an organization known for its centralized power.;   With the help of a government-imposed consent decree mandating democraticelections, reformers say that they have taken the first step toward wrestingcontrol of the union from its isolated, scandal-ridden leadership andreturning it to the rank and file.;    &quot;Democracy is coming to this union --slowly, but ever so surely,&quot; said C. Sam Theodus, a Carey supporter and areform candidate running for one of the Teamsters' 17 vice presidentialslots.;    Reform delegates concede that accomplishing their goal remains adaunting task. But they said they won more votes than expected and added thatthey could not have done better in what they described as a convention packedwith &quot;Old Guard&quot; delegates.;    Also Thursday, Teamsters voted to dramaticallyhike the strike benefits the international union pays, to $200 a week.;    Thecurrent strike pay is only $45 for the second week of a strike and $55 foreach week after that.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Lake Buena Vista, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910628  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  352  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 28, 199100180040,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
