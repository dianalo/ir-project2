<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-07-1036 </DOCNO><TEXT>In 47 expert contributions, this volume provides a summary of the latestresearch on radionuclides in nephro-urology together with current andnew clinical applications especially in renovascular hypertension, kidneytransplantation, and metabolic and urological diseases. In addition,attention is given to aspects of basic renal physiology and functionand possible applications of nuclear magnetic resonance and spectroscopyin nephro-urology. New testing procedures which promise to improve diagnosis,and new radiopharmaceuticals are described. The reports are divided intoeight sections, the first of which features studies on the renin-angiotensinsystem, cisplatin, atrial natriuretic factor and determining plasma oxalate.Four papers describe a number of new radiopharmaceuticals which havethe potential to replace hippuran. In the third section, radionuclidemethods for the measurement of renal function parameters are discussed.The book then focuses on the potential role of captopril in the improveddiagnosis of renovascular hypertension. Applications of nuclear magneticresonance and spectroscopy are demonstrated in the diagnosis of acutepyelonephritis, kidney assessment after lithotripsy, kidney evaluationprior to transplantation, and in monitoring renal ischemia during hypotension.</TEXT></DOC>
