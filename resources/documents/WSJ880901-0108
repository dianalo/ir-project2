The increase, which would take effect Jan. 1, would be less than the 26.3% raise that the president's pay advisers said is needed to put federal salaries on a par with comparable, private-sector jobs. But it would be more than the 2% increase the president had assumed would be authorized when he was planning his budget proposal early this year.    Legislation to appropriate enough funds to provide the 4.1% increase is making its way through Congress. The bill would provide raises to federal employees paid between $10,000 and $75,500 a year. President Reagan expressed regret that it wouldn't cover higher-paid employees, who lag most seriously behind private-sector pay.    In a letter to House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas), the president said his endorsement of the increase reflects the nation's continuing economic growth and the need &quot;to ensure the quality of the nation's civil service.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
