Once upon a time there was asoftware programmer who worked for ATEX, a Bedford, Mass.,maker of wordprocessing equipment. David Erickson wroteATEX's programs for big mainframe computers, but in 1982 hebought one of IBM's new personal computers. Mr. Ericksondidn't like the text editor, EDLIN, that was included withthe machine, so he decided to write his own. In June 1982, hefinished the program and called it XyWrite. Together withanother ATEX employee, John Hild, he decided to set up a newcompany, XyQuest, to sell the word processor.   From the beginning, XyWrite was the most sophisticatedword processor on the market. XyWrite II, which Messrs.Erickson and Hild brought out in May 1983, had features, suchas automatic footnoting and two on-screen windows, that wouldnot become common among IBM word processors for another threeyears. Written in assembly language -- the code computersthemselves &quot;speak&quot; -- XyWrite was also the fastest wordprocessor available. Newspapers and magazines began usingXyWrite, including the New York Times, Boston Globe, and theNew Republic and two of the principal computer journals, PCMagazine and PC Week. The editors of this newspaper also usethe program for writing and word processing.</LP><TEXT>   But XyWrite never became a best seller like WordPerfect orMicrosoft Word. For one thing, it was difficult to learn. Touse XyWrite, one had to memorize commands (such as &quot;type,&quot;&quot;call,&quot; &quot;save&quot;) that were to be written on a command linerather than chosen from a menu. Journalists weren'tintimidated, but some secretaries were. For another, XyWritehad the charm, but also the fallibilities of a small businessrun by MIT techies rather than M.B.A.s. Customers who calledfor technical support would sometimes find an obligingErickson on the other line. But the product's reputationdepended largely on word-of-mouth.   It was too bad, because by 1989, Mr. Erickson was workingon XyWrite IV, which promised once more to put XyWrite aheadof the field. Mr. Erickson figured out a way to allowon-screen editing of text that combined different fonts andgraphic images without sacrificing speed. And he also set upa menuing system for XyWrite that made it easier to use. ButMessrs. Erickson and Hild knew that unless they found a wayto market the new product, it would remain a niche product,treasured by aficionados, but ignored by the greatercomputing public.   Then along came IBM. Since its amazing success with thePC, IBM had a number of flops or semi-flops, from the PC Jr.to the OS/2 operating system. Its word processor was one ofthe least nimble on the market. Written by committee, DisplayWrite 5 requires a gargantuan 10 megabytes of disk space, yetlacks the speed and features of its competitors. Forinstance, a Display Write user could not see the bottom ofone page and the top of the succeeding on the same screen.   IBM knew it needed a word processor that could competewith WordPerfect and Microsoft Word, and XyQuest knew that itneeded marketing power behind its software. XyQuest had beenscheduled to release XyWrite IV in Spring 1990, but in Aprilit joined hands with IBM to produce a new word processor. ForIBM, it was an unusual arrangement. Big Blue stepped back andgave Mr. Erickson and XyQuest responsibility for writing thenew program -- to be called Signature and to be modeled onXyWrite IV. And it assigned Signature to a new DesktopSoftware Group, based in Milford, Conn., giving the groupwide latitude in bringing Signature to market.   IBM and XyQuest previewed it at a Boston Computer Societymeeting this March and sent out test copies that drew praise.It was promised that the new word processor would be releasedto the public in the second quarter. Meanwhile, IBM's DesktopSoftware Group released the program's code to third-partydevelopers, encouraging them to write programs that wouldaugment Signature's power. This wasn't unusual; it wasunprecedented. IBM seemed to be returning to thefreewheeling, hands-off strategy that had produced the firstPC. But then darkness descended on Milford.   The second quarter of 1991 came and went without Signatureappearing. Finally, as pressure mounted from disgruntledthird-party developers and from XyWrite users, who hadalready waited more than 18 months for an upgrade to XyWriteIII Plus, IBM and XyQuest disclosed that the product would bereleased Sept. 17. XyQuest planned to send out upgradenotices on Friday, Sept. 13. But it was not to be. At thelast moment, IBM announced that it was indefinitelypostponing the program's release. IBM officials said they hadto reorganize and re-evaluate the work of the DesktopSoftware Group, but they acknowledged that there was noproblem with the product.   Some say Signature may be sold to another computercompany. Asked about the future, IBM spokesperson Keith MaryRantas yesterday had no comment. She said &quot;the Signatureannouncement is on hold.&quot; In the end -- as reported in thisnewspaper -- IBM decided to disband the Desktop Softwaregroup.   Officials at XyQuest were predictably worried when Iphoned them. &quot;We've had apprehensions from the first,&quot;XyQuest Vice President James Adelson admitted. Mr. Adelsonsaid that if necessary, XyQuest was prepared to distributeSignature themselves. Third-party developers were livid. Onesoftware executive said, &quot;If worse comes to worse, we'll filea class-action suit against IBM because we all did this onpromise that there would be a product.&quot;   The XyQuest story might still have a happy ending. Butthis would be difficult: the computer software business liveson constant updating -- old software dies. Describing thedisbanding of the Desktop group, this newspaper's reporternoted that this step would have little impact on IBM's bottomline. But if IBM does finally abandon Signature, and XyQuestis forced to market it, this will be another example of howthe culture of the large corporation cannot accomodateinnovation. Large companies are best at winning market shareand at mass-producing semiconductors and circuit boards;small are best at designing hardware and writing software.   When large companies have tried to write software bycommittee, they have ended up with monstrosities like DisplayWrite or dBase IV, version 1.0. There are exceptions. Borlandand Microsoft are large companies that write good software,but they are run by programmers who recreate within theircompanies the freedom and individuality of the small start-uplike XyQuest, while maintaining a unified vision of theiroperation.   Last year, when IBM signed up XyQuest to write its ownsoftware and set up a quasi-independent Desktop group, itseemed to be heading in this direction. But in the end, IBMand XyQuest's partnership turned out to be another blindalley for innovation.   ---   Mr. Judis is a contributing editor of the New Republic andcorrespondent for In These Times.</TEXT></DOC>
