He said that wouldundermine his efforts for peace, although he noted his support in general forhelping Israel absorb the immigrants.;   Bush's veto threat seemed moresymbolic than real. While he can veto any legislation that reaches his desk,he has no constitutional power to prevent Congress from debating any issue itchooses.;   Bush opened his news conference with a strong statement on hisrequest for a delay in the loan guarantees that Israel wants to help absorbtens of thousands of Soviet immigrants.;   Secretary of State James Baker isdue to return to the region in the next few days, Bush noted, in his effortsto convene a peace conference among Israel and Arab nations.;   &quot;Too much isat stake to let domestic politics take precedence over peace,&quot; Bush said.;  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir says the United States has a moralobligation to provide loan guarantees to help pay the cost of absorbing theimmigrants. Bush made his comments as supporters of Israel were fanning acrossCapitol Hill in hopes of persuading Congress to reject the delay.;   Some keycongressional officials initially signaled their approval for a delay whenBaker first mentioned the subject last week. But since then, others have saidthey might not be so quick to go along.; WHAT HE SAID; On other topics at hispress conference, President Bush:; (box)Sidestepped a question on whether hebelieves the release of a western hostage in Beirut may be imminent. But hesaid Israel's recent release of Arab prisoners &quot;is bound to be viewed as very,very favorable.&quot;; (box)Said Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas is handlinghimself &quot;very, very well&quot; in his confirmation hearings, and he is &quot;moreconfident than ever that he will be confirmed.&quot;; (box) Defended CIA nomineeBob Gates anew and said he had given &quot;absolutely no consideration forwithdrawal.&quot; He noted &quot;feathery charges&quot; against him stemming from theIran-Contra affair but said they are nonsense.; Source: Associated Press  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910912  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  558  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, September 12, 199100256169,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
