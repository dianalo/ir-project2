Under the program, the agency will take weekly bids starting Friday on as much as 10 million bushels of surplus wheat.    Early losses in the precious-metal markets and the stock market didn't bode well with traders who viewed them as a sign of global deflation, analysts said.    &quot;A general slow down in the world economy wouldn't help,&quot; exports, said one trader.    Furthermore, any decline in domestic income is likely to affect consumers' food choices. Poultry might replace higher-priced choice-beef products and slow the expansion of the livestock sector. This would mean a cutback in grain feeding.    Reverberations from the Agriculture Department's decision continued to be felt in the wheat market as wheat futures for December delivery fell six cents, closing at $2.8225 a bushel. Analysts said the move is viewed as an attempt to free up stocks and to make the price of U.S. wheat more competitive on world markets.    They also speculated that the Agriculture Department wants to continue to support wheat exports with the Export Enhancement program, which compensates grain merchants for selling U.S. wheat at lower world prices. However, rising prices in the wheat market make this a less attractive option as the subsidies or compensation rise with them.    Offering more wheat to the market is &quot;a way of maintaining EEP and minimizing bonuses,&quot; said Ted Mao, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York.    Soybean and corn prices finished lower as a lack of new exports continued to weigh against the markets.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold-futures prices fell on continuing evidence of European central-bank selling aimed at propping the U.S. dollar, analysts and traders said. Also depressing prices early in the session were widespread producer selling and an absence of strong investment demand, analysts said. &quot;Investor interest is just not there,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director of Elders Futures Inc., New York. &quot;Traders are shying away from any risk-oriented investment,&quot; he added. Late-day profit-taking pared some of the declines, analysts said. December gold contracts on the Commodity Exchange in New York, after falling to an intraday low of $463.50 an ounce, closed at $470.60, down $1.90.    ENERGY: Crude-oil futures prices fell for the second day in a row in response to signs that some OPEC members had called for increased output. On Monday, the Kuwaiti news agency reported that several Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries insisted on raising the cartel's crude-oil production to 17.5 million barrels a day from its quota of 16.6 million barrels. But yesterday's price declines were restrained because such a quota rise could be more cosmetic than originally believed, some analysts said. &quot;You probably won't get a single extra barrel of oil on the market&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy-futures analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, December-delivery crude-oil contracts fell 13 cents, to $19.49 a barrel.    COPPER: Profit-taking cut short a two-day rally, but prices ended slightly lower after swinging over a mixed range of almost 2.50 cents. December-delivery copper fell 0.45 cent a pound to 85.60 cents. December traded as high as 86.90 cents and as low as 84.50 cents during the session. Fundamentals remained strong, and in the case of Commodity Exchange inventories, became even stronger, as the New York exchange's warehouse stocks Monday fell 4,066 tons from Friday, to 59,975 tons. The one-day drop was almost half of last week's decline in the exchange stocks, which had been regarded as a steep reduction. The tight supply continued to be reflected in the premium of December over March, which was almost unchanged. Another supporting factor was the strike that began last week at Southern Peru Copper Corp.'s Cuajone mine, which an analyst said was expected to extend to Southern Peru's Toquepala and Ito mines. &quot;Copper is one of the few markets whose fundamentals have enabled it to remain independently strong despite all the surrounding uncertainty,&quot; the analyst said. </TEXT></DOC>
