With two golf courses, four clubhouses and innumerablespecial-interest organizations, there is &quot;everything you needto get the most out of life,&quot; as a Rossmoor publicitybrochure states. But a few years ago, 3,000 Rossmoorians,about a third of the total population, thought the placeneeded better management. They declared their independencefrom the village governing board, and after a bitter fightbroke away.</LP><TEXT>   The secession didn't end the war between the estates atRossmoor. Now, residents are deposing one another over aproposal to install nursing-care facilities for their infirmneighbors. Others are fighting a developer over an endangeredsnake.   &quot;If it were managed properly, it would be heaven on earthto live here,&quot; says 67-year-old Julia Suess, a leader of adissidents' group at Rossmoor with her husband Ervin, 68.   &quot;It would be paradise if it weren't for those people,&quot;Kenneth Peifer, 76, a leader of the other side, says of thedissidents.   To many affluent, aging Americans, the idea of spendingone's golden years behind the gated confines of a well-to-doretirement community conjures up visions of carefree days ofgolf and lawn bowling. And indeed, most large retirementcommunities are pleasant places, with the majority ofresidents going about their business oblivious to anyswirling turmoil. Even the most outspoken dissidents say theywouldn't live anywhere else.   The retirement communities -- residents prefer to callthem &quot;senior adult communities,&quot; proudly pointing out thatsome residents still work -- provide resort-style living withdozens of hobby clubs and recreational outlets.   But there is another enduring pastime, too: quarreling.Many of the nation's 100 or so planned mega-retirementcommunities, home to about a million Americans, are riven byfactionalism, litigation and other unneighborliness. Whilesuch disputes are often confined to a small minority ofcitizens, they stand out for their ferocity and because theyoccur in places that are so outwardly serene.   University of California at Berkeley researchers found ina 1987 study that seniors are more apt to attack theirgoverning boards -- as well as to give them support -- thanresidents of other planned communities. Developers have longknown this. &quot;Any developer who thinks his residentorganizations are not political forces which merit carefulattention is in for a rude shock, probably sooner thanlater,&quot; says Paul Tatz, president of a Del Webb Corp. unitthat has developed the popular Sun City retirementcommunities in Arizona and Nevada.   Despite their idyllic surroundings, retirement communitiescan't keep out mismanagement by developers or maintenancecompanies -- or at least residents' perception ofmismanagement. Seniors in such places often have widelydifferent financial and medical needs, which is anothersource of friction. Moreover, retirement gives seniors thetime to pursue disputes to the extreme. And many of them arewell-equipped for battle, having spent careers ashard-charging executives.   &quot;They're litigious, and that's sad,&quot; says Cecil Riley, aformer Oakland city manager who resigned in disgust last yearafter 11 years as Rossmoor's general manager. &quot;It's not as ifthey're suing Dow Chemical or Johns-Manville. They're suingthemselves.&quot;   In terms of longevity, little can match the debate overwhether to incorporate the Sun City village in Arizona. Theidea was rejected in a 1964 election, but supporters havebeen trying every year since to collect enough signatures toforce another vote. Emotions are such that the leader of theanti-cityhood forces admits he keeps a hopeful eye on theobituary column in the local paper for the name of the manspearheading the incorporation movement.   Golfing is part of a tiff at the Laguna Hills, Calif.,Leisure World. Years ago, the village governing board passeda resolution giving identical recreational privileges tohomeowners and renters. That has led to a battle between thetwo groups -- and a lawsuit that's still pending. Says thehead of the owners' committee, Charles B. Hellmann, a retiredGeneral Electric executive: &quot;We have a certain esprit decorps as residents, but they don't rake the traps and theyplay as slowly as they want.&quot;   At the 4,000-resident Oakmont Village in Santa Rosa, inNorthern California's verdant Wine Country, two residentgroups are battling over how to buy a nearby golf course. Thefight, scheduled for trial in October in state superior courtin Sonoma County, is &quot;sort of like civil war,&quot; says Earl J.O'Grady, 70, leader of one group.   He admits his views haven't made him very popular: &quot;On thegolf course, they give you half the victory salute.&quot; Mr.O'Grady used to manage investor relations for a large WestCoast utility, but prefers that its name be kept out of thisbecause &quot;these people are kooks. They would sell their stockif they knew I had worked there.&quot;   At the 9,000-resident Century Village retirement communityin Pembroke Pines, Fla., a dissident group puts out anewspaper, called &quot;We the People News,&quot; to attack thecommunity's elected leaders and their followers. One recentheadline: &quot;Why I'm Angry.&quot; The owners' association fires backsalvos in its own monthly paper. Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Thibault,past president of the owners' association, says thedissidents &quot;are so stupid&quot; and are fighting for a last chanceto &quot;grab the gold ring&quot; by becoming important. &quot;And that ringkeeps eluding them, perhaps by young whippersnappers likemyself,&quot; says Mrs. Thibault, who's 58.   Rossmoor, which opened in 1964, looks like the last placeyou would find such dissention. Situated in a lush valleyabout 45 minutes out of San Francisco, the village boasts 27holes of golf, tennis courts, riding stables, lawn bowlinggreens, swimming pools and hiking trails. Residents canparticipate in more than 200 clubs and organizations devotedto everything from archaeology to yoga.   They can also participate in a variety of litigation. Thefocal point for criticism is the Golden Rain Foundation, anelected peer board of nine members that acts as trustee forRossmoor's common areas and facilities as well as provider ofmost maintenance. There are also a number of housingcorporations known as mutuals. Residents pay a monthly fee toGolden Rain: 30% goes to upkeep of the common grounds and 70%goes toward maintenance and services for the mutuals. Themutuals increasingly believe they haven't been getting theirmoney's worth.   The dissidents have their own club, known as the RossmoorResidents' Association, which holds monthly meetings toruminate over the latest village doings and to harangueGolden Rain. The meetings are something like revivals. At onesession several months ago, snowy-haired participants nodtheir heads and applaud enthusiastically as speaker afterspeaker denounces Rossmoor and what each considers itstyrannical system of government.   One red-faced speaker, John Guckeen, 61, a former buildingcontractor, stabs his finger in the air and shoutsobscenities over alleged mistreatment of elderlyRossmoorians. He asks for a show of hands from Golden Rainsympathizers, and when none are raised, offers thisdisclaimer: &quot;If you're from the Golden Rain and I tread onany of your feelings, well, too bad.&quot;   The First Walnut Creek Mutual, representing about a thirdof Rossmoor, went so far as to get out from under the GoldenRain umbrella and hire its own management in 1986. Thedissidents felt they had suffered more than $3 million inproperty damage due to Golden Rain's ineptitude, includingusing house paint that started peeling within two years. Somealso felt that Golden Rain had paid too much for an overhaulof the golf course, while others were simply peeved thatGolden Rain board members seemed to be getting preferentialtreatment. (&quot;That's an out-and-out lie,&quot; says Mr. Peifer, aformer Golden Rain president. Regarding the otherallegations, he says: &quot;I have no idea what they are talkingabout.&quot;)   Golden Rain filed suit in state superior court in Martinezto prevent First Mutual from withholding money from GoldenRain following the secession, and the mutual countersued,citing Golden Rain's alleged incompetence. First Mutual v.Golden Rain went to trial in November 1989 before a retiredjudge, who awarded First Mutual $437,000 of $750,000 indisputed management fees -- almost the legal costs for bothsides. The judge also ruled, however, that First Mutualfailed to prove allegations of poor property management byGolden Rain. The renegade mutual is still part of thecommunity in terms of receiving services such as security andrecreation, but pays another company for routine maintenance.   Dissidents generally view Golden Rain as a stooge of thedeveloper. But Golden Rain members counter that thedissidents are a small group of loudmouths in an otherwisefriendly and lovely community. &quot;They don't have much else todo. I could count on the fingers of two hands the people whoare constantly in the limelight,&quot; says Morton H. Lytle, 74, aretired Navy captain and current Golden Rain board member.But he adds: &quot;I don't think you can get 8,000 people livingin close proximity like we do, not only physically butsocially, without having some differences of opinion.&quot;   Mr. Peifer, the former Golden Rain president, says thedissidents are &quot;troublemakers&quot; who make criticizing thecommunity a full-time job. &quot;They're no longer paying off amortgage, bringing up a family and working full-time,&quot; hesays. &quot;They can work their mischief full-time. We don't getdown to their level. We're upbeat all the time.&quot;   The Golden Rain board members point out that they arefreely elected. The last time the dissidents made a seriousrun at the board, in 1986, they received only about 20% ofthe vote. The dissidents say that is because the other sideused dirty tricks. &quot;They said we were malcontents and not fitto be residents,&quot; says Ron Terry, now 66, a retiredbusinessman. &quot;It was just on the verge of being libelous.&quot;Responds Mr. Peifer: &quot;He's full of hooey.&quot;   At least two more squabbles are already in court. In one,dissidents are fighting a plan by Rossmoor's current builder,UDC Homes L.P., to bulldoze a grove of oak trees to make wayfor 370 new houses. They are concerned about congestion andlost views, but it also turns out that the endangered Alamedawhipsnake lives there, so they now have the Sierra Club ontheir side. A state superior court judge cleared thedevelopment plan earlier this year, but the Rossmoordissidents and the Sierra Club have appealed.   Another issue, now pending in state superior court inMartinez, involves a proposal to build nursing-carefacilities inside Rossmoor. Several residents filed suitagainst Golden Rain and the community's developer becausethey say they are concerned that the facility's workers willhave free access inside the community. But Mr. Riley, theformer Rossmoor manager, says there is more to it than that.&quot;The naysayers say if they {the residents} can't make a stepup the curb, get 'em out,&quot; he says.   In June, two other neighborhoods gave notice that theywere going to pull out of Golden Rain if it didn't solveproblems such as &quot;excessive time, cost and manpower requiredto accomplish even simple jobs&quot; and &quot;unacceptableinteractions between staff and directors and residents of themutual.&quot; The latest rebels include Rossmoor's largest mutual,but Ruskin Howell, its president, insists the community haslearned its lesson. &quot;This is all being done in a verypositive way,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
