The justices, without comment, let stand an Indiana Supreme Courtdecision that a husband has no right to interfere with his wife'sconstitutional right to abort her pregnancy.   The court also told deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcosand his wife, Imelda, they must turn over subpoenaed records to afederal grand jury.   The state court's ruling in the abortion case last July was baseddirectly on past rulings by the nation's highest court.   Erin Andrew Conn of Elkhart, Ind., went to court early lastsummer in an attempt to prevent his estranged wife, Jennifer, fromhaving an abortion. She was about six weeks pregnant at the time.   A state trial judge issued a temporary order barring Mrs. Connfrom having the operation performed, but a state appeals court threwout that order.   ``Erin has no right to veto Jennifer's decision ... as suchdecision concerns only her,'' the appeals court ruled.   The Indiana Supreme Court, acting on Conn's subsequent appeal,then adopted the appeals court ruling as its own.   The state courts said Conn's attempt to block his wife's abortionwas prohibited by prior Supreme Court rulings dating back to 1973,when a landmark decision by the justices legalized abortion.   In 1976, the court struck down a Missouri law requiring spousalconsent before a woman could obtain an abortion during the first 12weeks of her pregnancy.   After the state Supreme Court ruling, Conn sought emergency helpfrom Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice John PaulStevens. Both denied his request, and the injunction prohibitingMrs. Conn's abortion was lifted last July 22.   She subsequently obtained an abortion. The Conns are in the midstof divorce proceedings. Conn's attorney, James Bopp of Terre Haute,said a decree is expected within days.   In the appeal acted on today, Conn said the 1973 and 1976 rulingsdid not preclude state courts from taking a husband's rights intoconsideration ``on a case-by-case basis.''   ``The father has fundamental rights and interests in his unbornchild which should be judicially considered, on the facts of thiscase, along with the rights and interests of his wife in abortingtheir child,'' lawyers for Conn argued.   The appeal, which did not directly attack the court's previousabortion decisions, said consideration of a husband's objections isjustified by ``the traditional balancing approved by this courtwhere competing rights collide.''   Lawyers for Mrs. Conn called the appeal ``entirely withoutmerit.''   ``Every appellate court to consider the issue has held that a mandoes not have the right to a court order enjoining a woman fromexercising her abortion right,'' they said. ``This has been true incases where the man seeking the court order was the woman'shusband.''   The case is Conn vs. Conn, 88-347.   In other cases, the court:   _Denied the Marcoses' emergency request that they not becompelled to abide by a grand jury's demand for financial and otherrecords related to an investigation of the couple, charged withlooting their nation's treasury of more than $100 million.   A federal judge in New York, where the grand jury is meeting,ruled Aug. 11 that the Marcoses must honor the subpoenas and nolonger have immunity as ruler and first lady of a foreign country.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling Oct.19.   _Let stand an appellate ruling that the federal Voting RightsAct, designed to prevent racial discrimination, applies to statejudicial elections.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Louisianaofficials who said the law is not intended to cover the judicialbranch and could impair the independence of judges.   _Agreed to consider the constitutionality of a Connecticut lawaimed at assuring that beer sold in the state costs no more than itdoes in three neighboring states.</TEXT></DOC>
