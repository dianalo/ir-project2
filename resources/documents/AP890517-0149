They were the first elected officials questioned in the Recruitscandal, in which 14 bureaucrats and businessmen were arrested oncharges of bribery or securities law violations.   Prosecutors said Takao Fujinami, chief Cabinet secretary underformer former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, and Katsuya Ikeda,a legislator from the opposition Komeito Party, each werequestioned for about 12 hours.   The two are suspected of accepting bribes in return for helpingthe Recruit Co. in its employment information business.   Under Japanese legal custom, summonses for interrogation areregarded as an equivalent to arrest.   Ikeda, 51, said Tuesday that he would resign his Parliamentseat. Ruling party officials denied reports that Fujinami, 56,would resign, but indicated he might have to do so if he isformally charged.   Also on Wednesday, Komeito chairman Junya Yano became the thirdparty leader to step down in the scandal. He follows Prime MinisterNoboru Takeshita, who is resigning as head of the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party _ and thus as prime minister _ and SaburoTsukamoto, who stepped down in February as head of the oppositionDemocratic Socialist Party.   Ruling party leaders still are trying to find a new primeminister who is untainted by the scandal.   ``People hope that the prosecutors will go to the center ofNakasone administration,'' said Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-generalof the Japan Socialist Party.   News reports Tuesday said Nakasone would be willing to testifyin Parliament concerning his links to Recruit. His refusal totestify in past months contributed to an opposition boycott ofparliamentary business.   Aides to Nakasone were among some 160 politicians, bureaucratsand businessmen who bought bargain-priced unlisted shares in aRecruit subsidiary and made large profits when the price soaredafter public trading began.   Of 17 politicians linked to purchases of Recruit shares, 11 weremembers of the Cabinet of Nakasone, who was prime minister at thetime of the share transactions.   A share transaction handled by Fujinami's secretary broughtprofits of about $191,000, prosecutors said. Ikeda's brother,Yuzuru, earned about $73,530 on Recruit share transactions, andnews reports say 70 percent of that went into Ikeda's own bankaccount.   Ikeda repeatedly raised questions in Parliament that prosecutorssay were helpful to Recruit.   Komeito leaders held an emergency meeting and Chairman Yanolater told reporters that he believed Ikeda's statement that he wasinnocent of wrongdoing. But the Komeito chairman said public trustin the party had been impaired and said he had resigned.   Yano himself is under fire for links to an earlier scandalinvolving transactions.</TEXT></DOC>
