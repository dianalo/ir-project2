Some of that cash probably should be in stockmutual funds, and emerging growth stock funds may be best of all. Stocks and,therefore, stock funds, have consistently outperformed most other investmentsover long periods, and they usually stage big rallies midway throughrecessions.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  IGNORE WAR; BUY STOCKS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Consider an investment mix suggested by the Portola Group, a Menlo Parkmoney management and investment advisory firm. The firm is telling clients toput nearly 50 percent of their money in U.S. stock funds, 15 percent to 20percent in foreign stock funds and 5 percent in the stocks of North Americangold-mining companies. The rest of the money should be earmarked for municipalbonds or U.S. Treasury note funds.;    'THIS IS an optimistic scenario thatsays we will weather today's economic problems as we have in the past,&quot; saysRobert Fitzwilson, director of the Portola Group. &quot;But it also allows forprotection in case our federal budget problems and the economy get out ofcontrol.&quot;;    It's telling that only a small piece of the firm's modelportfolio is dedicated to bond funds. Interest rates have been falling andpushing up bond prices, and this may seem odd. But think again. Despitecontinuing layoffs, we're also seeing signs that the economy isn't in as badshape as we fear. IBM, a gigantic and highly economic-sensitive company, issuddenly on a new roll. This suggests that interest rates may be closer to abottom than a top, and bond prices may not go much higher.;    Bear in mind,too, that rates have already fallen markedly. The yield on U.S. Treasurybonds, for example, has already declined more than one percentage point sincelast fall, to barely more than 8 percent, and most experts don't think it willfall much below 7.5 percent. And with highly volatile oil prices, there'salways the risk that rates will shoot back up, which would sharply diminishreturns in bonds.;    Conway, Williams andamp; Foster Inc., a Menlo Park moneymanagement firm, acknowledges that the Fed has hinted strongly that it willkeep easing rates if the recession persists. Yet it says the Federal Reserveremains in no mood to relax its fight against inflation.;    &quot;It still reactsin a major way every time there is a big jump in wholesale or retailinflation,&quot; says Jane Williams, the firm's executive vice president.;    Amongthe advocates of stock mutual funds today is Gerald Perritt, president ofInvestment Information Services in Chicago. He's telling clients to put only30 percent of their assets in stocks. But he intends to boost his stockallocation substantially once the outcome of the Persian Gulf war becomesclearer.;    &quot;One of the worst things investors can do is wait for a turn inthe economy before they commit to stocks,&quot; Perritt says. &quot;By then, the markethas already made its turn and produced the really big returns.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Steve Kaufman column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910128  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  563  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday January 28, 199100028105,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
