That's what a lot of people are wondering these days as interest rates continue to rise. An estimated 53% of home-mortgage borrowers have ARMs, compared with only 21% two years ago. Such loans now total $450 billion.    Converting to a fixed rate usually means refinancing, which often involves paying expensive closing costs. But many ARMs taken out in recent years allow borrowers to switch to a fixed rate some time between the first and fifth years of the loan for a modest fee. At Empire of America in Buffalo, N.Y., for example, ARM borrowers with such loan agreements recently could convert to a fixed rate of 11.25% for a $250 fee. Some lenders even waive the fees altogether, says Robert Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter.    The temptation to convert to a fixed-rate loan can be great, especially for nervous borrowers who took out their loans at below-market &quot;teaser&quot; rates and are now nearing a periodic adjustment that will tack on two percentage points or more to their annual interest rate. On a $100,000 mortgage, a two-percentage-point increase to 10% from 8% would add about $143 to a homeowner's monthly costs, making it $877 a month.    Whether converting to a fixed rate makes sense for a homeowner depends on several factors, however, and the answer won't be the same for every borrower. Still, many mortgage brokers, financial planners and real-estate executives say that, in general, now isn't the time for a switch.    &quot;It isn't a good move when interest rates are rising because you lock in long-term, high-rate costs,&quot; says Mr. Heady. Adds Dennis Jacobe, research director at the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in Chicago: &quot;The time to lock in fixed-rate mortgages is when they fall to single digits.&quot;    David R. Keeney, senior vice president for Empire of America's Realty Credit Corp. unit, has a simple rule of thumb: &quot;If the differential between the ARM and the fixed rate exceeds two to 2 1/2 percentage points, it doesn't make sense to switch to a fixed rate.&quot;    But as the gap narrows, deciding whether to convert becomes tricky. Here are some questions that homeowners should consider before switching:   How fast will interest rates climb, how high will they go, and how long will they stay there?    This is, of course, the most important question; after all, any decision on conversion is essentially a gamble on interest-rate changes. And -- for what it's worth -- most economists expect rates to continue climbing in the near term, then level off and decline.    &quot;There's an excellent case to be made for lower interest rates over the long term,&quot; says Adrian Moravcsik, a financial planner at Bailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., investment-management firm. &quot;I'd hate to pay points to refinance a loan and then see rates come down one or two points next year.&quot;    Joseph Vinso, a finance professor at the University of Southern California, says political and economic issues currently are in a &quot;period of instability.&quot; He adds: &quot;People that make decisions in a period of instability are more likely to lose than win.&quot;    What index is the ARM linked to?    Rates on loans tied to an index of Treasury securities, which is the predominant index used for ARMs issued by lenders in the East and Midwest, rise and fall faster than those tied to the monthly cost-of-funds index issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, used more often in the West.    Over the past year and a half, for example, the cost-of-funds index hasn't varied more than half of one percentage point, while the Treasury-securities index has risen 1.75 percentage points. The Treasury-securities index, for instance, will more quickly reflect the latest round of rate increases, while the monthly cost-of-funds index will lag behind. On the other hand, the Treasury-securities index will respond more quickly when rates decline.    &quot;It's a good time to study the index on which your mortgage is based and track its movements over the past few years,&quot; says Stan Ross, managing partner in Kenneth Leventhal andamp; Co., a Los Angeles realestate accounting firm. In October, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board will begin requiring all ARM lenders to provide borrowers with a history of the movement of their index over the past 10 years.    When rates are climbing, borrowers with ARMs linked to the Treasury-securities index need to act quicker if they want to convert to a fixed loan before rates rise even further. An index that responds more slowly gives borrowers more time to consider switching. -   How long does the borrower plan to stay in the home and keep the loan?    If the homeowner plans to live in the home only for three or four years, converting to a fixed-rate mortgage probably isn't worth the cost.    S. Timothy Kochis, national director of personal financial planning for the accounting firm Deloitte, Haskins andamp; Sells, says that a homeowner with a $100,000 loan who has to pay the typical costs of refinancing an ARM to an 11% fixed mortgage would have to remain in the home an additional 2 1/2 to four years before the benefits of switching to a fixed rate offset the cost of refinancing. And that assumes a prolonged period of high interest rates that would have driven the ARM to 13% in September 1990 and kept it there.    What kind of interest-rate cap does the ARM have?    Most ARMs have a cap that limits rate increases to two percentage points a year and five or six percentage points over the life of the loan. Some mortgages, most notably in California, limit how high the payment -- not the rate -- can rise between adjustment periods.    An important question is how far along homeowners are toward the lifetime cap. &quot;If you have a six percentage-point cap, and your mortgage rate has already moved up four percentage points, then your upside risk is only two percentage points,&quot; says Brian Shappelle, senior director of the Mortgage Bankers Association, a Washington-based trade group. A borrower who converts to a fixed-rate mortgage &quot;might be shutting off the opportunity for lower rates,&quot; he adds.    Suppose a home buyer took out an ARM based on the Treasury-securities index in August 1987 with an initial rate of 7%. The rate adjusts yearly, but it can increase no more than two percentage points in any single year; over the life of the loan the rate can't exceed 13%.    Today, the borrower's ARM rate stands at 9%. If the borrower keeps the ARM, the rate will remain at 9% until August 1989. If rates continue to increase, the rate would then rise to 11% and remain there until August 1990. So over that period the borrower would be better off with the ARM -- averaging 10% -- instead of a 10.8% fixed loan.    Adds Mr. Jacobe of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions: &quot;The decision of whether to convert depends on the probability of rates escalating from now through August 1990 and remaining at that elevated level. What is the chance of the ARM rate jumping to 13% in August 1990, and remaining there for a number of years?&quot; If borrowers feel this is extremely likely, then they should convert and pay the extra cost for the certainty of a steady rate, Mr. Jacobe says. The more in doubt they are, however, the less willing they should be to pay the extra cost.    What are the costs of converting or refinancing an ARM?    For ARMs that include provisions for converting to fixed-rate loans, the conversion fees average about $250, Mr. Keeney says, although the amount does vary. Under such conversion agreements, the borrower may also have to pay a premium and servicing fee of about 0.63 of one percentage point over the current fixed rate -- ending up with an 11.4% fixed rate, for instance, instead of 10.8%.    Borrowers who have to refinance their loans to get a fixed rate also face widely varying costs, with California and Florida offering the best deals for borrowers, Mr. Keeney says, because the markets there are so competitive. But the typical refinancing charge is 2% of the total loan upfront -- plus closing costs for a title search, escrow fees and other incidentals adding up to an additional 1 1/2 to two points. For instance, at Great Western Bank, of Beverly Hills, Calif., one of the nation's largest thrifts, a borrower would pay total costs of 3.5% to 4% of the total loan to switch to a fixed-rate mortgage; of that, about two percentage points goes to Great Western, and the rest goes for closing costs.    ---              Comparing the Cost: Adjustable vs.                     Fixed-Rate Loans   After-tax cost* per $100,000 of mortgage over first 10 years of a 30-year loan                                      Interest   Principal    Case 1: $65,000    Fixed-Rate Mortgage    One-year adjustable-rate mortgage    is converted to 11% fixed-rate    mortgage in Sept. 1988             $59,700    $85,300    Case 2: $72,500    ARM With Rising Rates    Prolonged period of high interest    rates drives ARM to its 13%    lifetime ceiling at annual adjust-    ment in Sept. 1990 and keeps it at    that level through Sept. 1998      $68,200    $84,300    Case 3: $62,500    ARM With Rates Rising,    Then Falling    Interest rates rise through 1989,    level off, then decline to some-    what current levels.
