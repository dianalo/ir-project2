Dryden'sBattery Systems Laboratory (BSL), a computerized facility for batterymaintenance servicing, has developed over two decades into one of themost advanced facilities of its kind in the world. Recently a major BSLupgrade was initiated with the goal of modernization to provide flexibilityin meeting the needs of future advanced projects. The new facility willbe called the Aerospace Energy Systems Laboratory (AESL) and will employdistributed processing linked to a centralized data base. AESL will beboth a multistation servicing facility and a research laboratory forthe advancement of energy storage system maintenance techniques. Thispaper describes the baseline requirements for the AESL and the designapproach being taken for its mechanization.</TEXT></DOC>
