Other Asian stock markets also surged ahead today, apparentlyreassured that a repeat of the global crash of 1987 wasn't in themaking.   News that the Dow Jones industrial average rose by more than 88points on Monday, reversing almost half of Friday's big 190-pointselloff, helped propel the Tokyo market to its second-biggest pointgain of the year.   The Nikkei Stock Average jumped by 527.39 points, or 1.53percent, to 34,996.08. The rally erased most of Monday's647.33-point plunge.   Traders said volume was a moderate 650 million shares, up fromMonday's thin total of 520 million shares.   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto praised coordinationbetween financial authorities of the Group of Seven leadingindustrial nations during the stock crisis. He also repeatedremarks he made Monday that he wasn't seriously concerned about theimpact of Friday's plunge in New York.   ``I don't think markets moved that sharply,'' he said at a pressconference after a regular Cabinet meeting.   A dealer at Nomura Securities, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said one reason Friday's Wall Street plunge didn't leadto another crash was because interest rates are lower today thantwo years ago.   ``The crash in New York (on Friday) was not linked to uneasinessabout funds, as was the crash of Black Monday,'' the dealer said,referring to the record 508-point fall in the Dow industrials onOct. 19, 1987.   But Haruhito Ichimura, a trader with Nippon Kangyo KakumaruSecurities, said it was too early to tell whether Wall Street hadrecovered completely from its fall.   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer with Daiwa Bank, said there wererumors Tuesday that Japanese banks again were backing away from arevised plan for financing a buyout of United Airlines' parentcompany, although they had little impact on share prices.   The refusal of banks, many Japanese, to support the proposed$6.75 billion buyout helped trigger last Friday's plunge on WallStreet. A Citibank spokesman in Tokyo said the bank was presentinga revised financing package for a bid of $250 a share, down from$300 a share under the original plan, but United's pilots deniedthere was any formal offer at the lower price.   The U.S. dollar ended trading at 142.25 yen in Tokyo, up 1.50yen from Monday. It moved within a range of 141.80 yen to 142.35yen during the day.   Elsewhere in Asia Tuesday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged94.20 points to close at 2695.90, recovering some of the groundlost Monday when it fell 6.5 percent.   Indexes in Australia and New Zealand, which fell about 8 percenton Monday, finished today with gains of 3.8 percent and 5.7percent, respectively.   Taiwan's stock index gained 410.32 points to close at 10,100.52.It was the market's biggest one-day point gain ever and more thanerased Monday's decline of 329.48.   ``The recovery on Wall Street relieves worries over a worldwidecrash and draws bargain-hunters,'' said one Taiwan broker, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   Share prices rebounded in Thailand and the Philippines.</TEXT></DOC>
