There are those who swear that instead of having beenexecuted by a firing squad on Christmas Day 1989, the oldCommunist dictator is actually holed up in one of hiscountryside villas, hunting in the woods just like always.The tabloid &quot;Strict Secret&quot; reported that he might be inChina or North Korea. And his ruddy face stares out fromsidewalk newspaper stands all over Bucharest, smiling above amagazine story detailing how shoes and soup bones werecheaper when he was president.</LP><TEXT>   Even some of those who concede his death refuse todiscount a spiritual comeback. Regularly, fresh flowersappear on his presumed grave, an unmarked hump of dirt in aweed-infested cemetery here. &quot;Ceausescu, come out of yourgrave / To make the gypsies work / And to discipline theHungarians,&quot; one of his old court poets wrote in a Romaniannewspaper in May.   Generally, this has all been dismissed as bizarrenostalgia or absurd black humor. Then the Soviet hard-linersstaged their ill-fated coup in Moscow. And, suddenly, all ofRomania began seeing Ceausescu's ghost.   &quot;Decision-makers and opposition forces must understandthat in the present circumstances their cooperation isdecisive when facing a single and terrible danger: therestoration of the old regime,&quot; the Romanian government saidin a coup-day statement. &quot;Any nostalgia for Communisttotalitarianism can only be the {result} of a dangerousforgetfulness.&quot;   The coup attempt in Moscow rekindled old nightmaresthroughout Eastern Europe, where for years officialsroutinely disappeared for &quot;health&quot; reasons and &quot;criminalelements&quot; were constantly being purged. But most haunted ofall are the Romanians, who fought the fiercest in the seriesof anti-Communist revolutions in 1989 and who today stillhaven't totally won. And while the collapse of the Moscowcoup inspired a nationwide sigh of relief, joy was temperedwith the sober reality that all of the old demons haven't yetbeen exorcised.   &quot;We are very happy with the outcome, but we can't be toooptimistic,&quot; says Adrian Severin, Romania's deputy primeminister in charge of economic and social reform. &quot;It must beremembered that what today is a failure could tomorrow be asuccess, there or in other countries.&quot;   Like Romania. &quot;Unfortunately, as with the Soviet Union,the old Communist structures haven't been dismantled here,&quot;says Nicolae Manolescu, a leader of the Civic Alliancepro-democracy movement. &quot;We know there are certain circles inthe country that would like to try to do the same thing {aswas tried in Moscow}.&quot;   The weathered graffitti of Romania's Christmas uprisingstill shout from the weary walls of Bucharest: Down with theCommunist Party, Down with Securitate (the dreaded securitypolice), Down with the Nomenklatura (the privileged partymembers). But while those elements may indeed be down, theyaren't out.   The Romanian Communist Party is back in business, workingout of a little house, befitting its size, in one ofBucharest's shabby old residential areas under the brightmetal sign of the Socialist Labor Party, as it is known.Former members of the Securitate are said to be behind acouple of newspapers. And the Nomenklatura are still lurkingin the bureaucracy.   At the Socialists' house, Emeric Dombi, a member of theparty's central committee, waves a new manifesto, adoptedearlier this month. He wears a cloak of democracy whiletrying to capitalize on the frustrations and fears generatedby democratic social and economic reforms. &quot;We are a newparty,&quot; he promises. &quot;We are a democratic party. We are forthe market economy.&quot;   But as he fidgets in his chair in the office of theparty's president, Ilie Verdet, an old Ceausescu crony, Mr.Dombi's rhetoric slides steadily back in time. &quot;But it mustbe an economy with social protections,&quot; he warns. &quot;The wholethinking should start with protecting the great masses. Whatis happening today is that the government is working againstthe masses. This market economy is a wild one. No rules, noframework. Prices are high. Salaries are low. Chaos.&quot; The olddictator couldn't have said it better.   The Socialists' response to the first news of the Moscowcoup sounded straight out of Cuba. It was the internalbusiness of the Soviet Union, they said. When the coupcollapsed, they remained undaunted.   &quot;I have no comment on that,&quot; says Mr. Dombi. Instead, heelaborates on one of his party's principles: the return ofproperty and money seized from the Communists after therevolution. &quot;Those properties,&quot; he insists, &quot;were the rewardfor the contributions to Romania {made by} some of themembers of our new party.&quot;   In his office across town, the 37-year-old Mr. Severinlooks relaxed as he drinks Pepsi and listens to Elvis's &quot;BlueSuede Shoes&quot; and various Beach Boys surfing tunes on theradio. But he is ever vigilant for those who would undo thereforms of the National Salvation Front, the governing party.   &quot;We have to do the best we can to take out the roots ofthe former regime,&quot; he says. &quot;Because if we let in even apiece of the roots, they can be very dangerous to ourprocess.&quot;   Mr. Severin has heard the complaints of the people onRomania's potholed streets, which are often filled withstrikers and protesters grumbling about the effects of priceliberalization. While they eagerly embrace the freedoms ofdemocracy, they seem to want to have them at the controlledprices -- for meat, clothes, housing -- of the dictatorship.Those who want to slow down or reverse the reforms repeat acommon litany: Meat was always scarce, now it is scarce andexpensive.   &quot;That approach is very tempting,&quot; Mr. Severin says. &quot;Butwe can't forget this {coup} experience of the Soviet Union.We have no option but to speed up reform, and theinternational community must reinforce its support for thisprocess. If the standard of living level is going lower andlower, you can't know at which point people become lessattracted by democratic ideals.&quot;   Toni Popescu, a taxi driver speeding to take a passengerto Ceausescu's grave, spits out a stream of invective againstthe dictator and the Communists. But as he parks in front ofa sprawling lot of unfinished apartments, he says, &quot;In timeof Ceausescu, much construction. Now, no construction.&quot;   Mr. Popescu leads the way to the grave (&quot;It's a secret. Iwill show you,&quot; he says). There, old women in colorful shawlstending nearby graves provide an eerie epitaph. &quot;Ceausescu,meat, little money,&quot; says one of the women, speaking inbroken English. &quot;No Ceausescu, meat, big money.&quot;   In the recent issue of a newspaper backed by elements ofthe old regime, Ceausescu's picture is matched with a photoof Petre Roman, the present prime minister. Below is a pricecomparison for various basic commodities and appliances from1989, Ceausescu's last year, and today. The Ceausescu pricesare lower on every count.   The temptation is great. &quot;One used to say that Ceausescuwas a pig,&quot; an artist of the Ceausescu court recently toldGerman visitors. &quot;Now, people say that he was just a piglet,after all.&quot;   On Bucharest's main street, about 100 protesterscommemorating the Christmas revolution urge their countrymennot to be seduced. &quot;Given what has happened in Moscow, thisis where all Romanians should be, remembering the heroes ofthe revolution,&quot; says Aurel Tardea, a medical student.   A chant of &quot;Down with communism&quot; carries the marchersalong the route.   &quot;Same slogan,&quot; says Mr. Tardea. &quot;Twenty months later.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
