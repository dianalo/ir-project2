It is hypothesizedthat the Soviet Union chooses to exploit the FRG's position in NATO bycultivating a special relationship with it and thereby accessing theU.S. and NATO as a whole, rather than making overt efforts to force anear-term split between West Germany and the U.S. The thesis focuseson the instruments the Soviet Union uses to maximize its influence inthe FRG and the region. These instruments include West Germany's concernsregarding nuclear war in Europe, Ostpolitik and German-German relations.</TEXT></DOC>
