Maxwell, controlled by flamboyant British media tycoon Robert Maxwell, is the third concern or group recently to acquire a stake in Skokie, Ill.-based Bell andamp; Howell, a publishing and information concern. The Bell andamp; Howell investment follows four acquisitions in recent days by the Oxford, England-based publishing and printing company, which thanks to a #630 million ($1.12 billion) share issue earlier this year has found itself able to pursue its aggressive expansion plans despite the stock market crash.    In a letter to Bell andamp; Howell's chairman, Donald N. Frey, Mr. Maxwell said the company plans to make a Hart-Scott-Rodino filing to permit it to purchase more than 50% of Bell andamp; Howell's stock. In response to the letter, a spokesman repeated the company's position that Bell andamp; Howell wants to remain independent, and added that the letter took the company by surprise. Bell andamp; Howell released details of the letter, but wouldn't make the entire text public.    Mr. Maxwell expressed surprise that Mr. Frey didn't first notify him about releasing the contents and said he was &quot;miffed&quot; that Bell andamp; Howell didn't release the entire letter. Mr. Maxwell said the letter discussed the advantages of a merger of the two companies and noted that his company recently appointed Bell andamp; Howell's microform publishing unit to distribute microform editions of its scientific journals -- which Mr. Maxwell said he told Mr. Frey was an example of &quot;the synergy between our two groups.&quot; The Maxwell chairman said in a telephone interview from Jerusalem, where he was traveling on business, &quot;The selective release of the letter without consultation is rather surprising and strange.&quot;    Mr. Maxwell said he would wait for &quot;a considered reply&quot; from Bell andamp; Howell before making another move. A Bell andamp; Howell spokesman said yesterday company officials &quot;haven't discussed the possibility of a response.&quot; Mr. Maxwell noted Bell andamp; Howell faces pressure from the two other investors. Since last month Macmillan Inc. has bought a 7.7% stake in the company and said it may seek control. More recently, an investor group including Robert M. Bass, a Fort Worth, Texas-based investor, raised its stake to 15.9%. In its initial Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it held the shares for investment purposes. The other investors are &quot;heading for control without paying a premium,&quot; Mr. Maxwell said. &quot;We are prepared to pay a premium for control.&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Bell andamp; Howell stock closed at $55.25, up 75 cents, giving the company an indicated value of $519 million.    The Bell andamp; Howell spokesman who said the company was surprised by the letter, noted that Mr. Frey during the summer refused to take a phone call from Mr. Maxwell, an indication that Bell andamp; Howell had hoped to discourage Maxwell from approaching the company again.    In the letter, Maxwell sought to assure Bell andamp; Howell that its expression of interest was not being made &quot;with any hostile intent,&quot; Bell andamp; Howell said. Mr. Maxwell said, &quot;We wish to avoid battles and join them only if we're forced to.&quot;    But Maxwell's letter may diminish Mr. Frey's hopes that the stock market's recent plunge might scare away any possible raiders because many sustained big losses in the market. Bell andamp; Howell's shares traded as high as $71.125 in the week before the crash.    Mr. Maxwell hasn't been deterred by the crash, although his company's share price has fallen 33% since Oct. 15 to 229 pence ($4.07) late Friday on London's stock exchange. The company said in September it had net cash and short-term investments of #400 million, following the July share issue. Mr. Maxwell controls Maxwell Communication, which recently changed its name from British Printing andamp; Communication Corp., through Liechtenstein-based Pergamon Holding Foundation. The ultimate owners of the foundation, which also owns Britain's tabloid Daily Mirror, several other newspapers and investments in several television ventures, aren't known.    Mr. Maxwell has said frequently he wants Maxwell Communication's revenue to at least triple by 1990, from about #1 billion this year. In 1986 the company earned pretax profit of #80.3 million and net income of #60.3 million on sales of #461.7 million. Already a series of acquisitions have made the company the U.S.'s second-largest commercial printer. Bell andamp; Howell's interests in textbooks and information services would &quot;fit us like a glove,&quot; Mr. Maxwell said.    Bell andamp; Howell could fulfill some of the ambitions frustrated earlier this year in Mr. Maxwell's unsuccessful $1.7 billion bid for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. Harcourt, an Orlando, Fla.-based company with big publishing interests, blocked the British publisher with a recapitalization plan.    Mr. Maxwell has moved determinedly to expand in recent years. Last week alone, Maxwell Communication agreed to spend at least #170 million. It agreed to acquire for an amount that wasn't disclosed Alco Gravure Inc., a Rochelle Park, N.J.-based printer; agreed to pay #34.8 million for United Trade Press Holding Ltd., a British publisher of trade magazines; agreed to pay #4 million for 70% of Nimbus Records Ltd., a British maker of compact disks; and agreed to pay as much as #111 million for Pergamon Orbit Infoline, an electronic-publishing company held privately by Mr. Maxwell's Pergamon foundation. The company also disclosed a stake of just under 15% in De La Rue Co., a British high-security printing company.    In 1986, Bell andamp; Howell earned $32.9 million, or $3.10 a share, on sales of $853.4 million.    Bell andamp; Howell has been selling units to concentrate on its core businesses. During the summer, the company made its biggest divestituture, selling its 85% stake in Devry Inc., a technical-school operator, for about $147 million. </TEXT></DOC>
