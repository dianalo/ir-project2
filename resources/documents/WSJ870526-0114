WinterStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)ECONOMIC AND MONETARY INDICATORS (EMI)INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, MACHINE TOOLS (IND) </IN><TEXT>   Some durable goods manufacturers have big plans for facilities investment, but are delaying a final commitment, equipment suppliers say.    U.S. machine tool companies reported April orders were at the lowest level for any month in four years, and were down 33% from a year earlier. Yet, builders of complex machines used to shape metal parts say they are getting a lot of requests for quotes on prices and performance specifications.    The problem is the big companies are delaying multiple-machine orders, says says Donald G. Shively, executive vice president, operations, for Cincinnati Milacron Inc.    Meanwhile, small shops aren't buying machine tools because basic industrial activity is relatively sluggish; machine tool producers don't have the usual stream of one-machine and two-machine orders, Mr. Shively explained.    &quot;There's a general hesitancy to move along on any projects,&quot; agrees Kermit T. Kuck, chairman and chief executive officer of Monarch Machine Tool Co., Sidney, Ohio. &quot;There doesn't seem to be the will to take the final action required&quot; signing the order.    The National Machine Tool Builders' Association reported April orders for all kinds of U.S.-made machine tools fell to $129.9 million, from $193.3 million a year earlier, and were 21% below the $164.2 million level of March.    Orders for milling machines, machining centers, grinders, lathes, boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting were $79.2 million, down 42% from $136.2 million a year earlier, the association said. Last month's orders for metal-forming presses and other machines to shape metal with pressure were $50.8 million, down 11% from $57.1 million a year earlier.    &quot;We're not too concerned because inquiry activity is higher than a year ago,&quot; says Herbert A. Beyer, president and chief executive officer of Devlieg Machine Co., Royal Oak, Mich. &quot;The promise is out there, but results haven't happened yet.    &quot;The next 60 to 90 days could be a very good order period for us,&quot; Mr. Beyer adds. &quot;Orders that we expected in the first part of the year have been delayed, but we think they will be placed before the end of the year.&quot;    The higher-valued Japanese yen and West German mark are presenting export opportunities, but many of those orders still are being negotiated as well, says R.L. Evans, president of the Landis Tool Co., Waynesboro, Pa., division of Litton Industries Inc. &quot;Some of the less-developed countries have sharpened their pencils and are picking up some parts business,&quot; and are shopping for machine tools to make the parts, he says.    For the first four months of 1987, U.S. machine tool companies reported a 25% increase in orders for export to $87.5 million from $69.8 million a year earlier, NMTBA said.    U.S. machine tool producers have slashed shipments so far this year about 20% from a year earlier, all in response to an approximate 25% decline in orders since mid-1986 from order levels in the previous 18 months.    April shipments were $172.5 million, down 18% from $209.6 million in the comparable year-earlier month, NMTBA said.    The industry's backlog of unshipped orders at the end of April was $1.15 billion, down 31% from a year earlier, the association said.    ---                      April 1987    March 1987    April 1986    Comparative new orders for metal-cutting machines: Domestic .......... $64,900,000  $107,550,000  $118,300,000 Foreign ............ 14,250,000    15,900,000    17,850,000   Total ............ 79,150,000   123,450,000   136,150,000    Four-month total for '87: $405,250,000; for '86:$599,650,000.
