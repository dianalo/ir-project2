STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hard-liner Erich Honecker on Friday rejected talkswith the East German opposition, but officials of his regimeannounced they had freed pro-democracy activists from jail andwould let hundreds more refugees go West.   For the first time, a high-ranking East German official spokeopenly when asked about a possible resignation by the 77-year-oldHonecker.   A spokeswoman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office in Bonn saidan East German diplomat told the government late Friday that EastGerman refugees at the West Germany Embassy in Warsaw would beafforded passage to West Germany.   The spokeswoman, who confirmed an East Berlin report, said itwas not clear when the more than 600 refugees in Warsaw would betransported out of Poland. She spoke to The Associated Press oncondition of anonymity.   West Germany's ZDF TV network reported from Warsaw that buseswere arranged for the refugees, but no firm plans were announcedfor their departure.   In East Berlin, the state news agency ADN announced that all but11 of the estimated 1,000 protesters jailed after pro-democracydemonstrations last week and on Monday were released. It said 11people charged with violent acts during the demonstrations remainedin jail and would face trial.   Dietmar Keller, the second-ranking official in the East GermanCulture Ministry, told reporters in Wolfenbuettel, West Germany:``As for Erich Honecker's resignation, Erich Honecker must makethat decision all alone.''   He said any decision would require a meeting of the partyCentral Committee and ``I don't know if a meeting is planned oralready called.''   Honecker himself, recuperating from recent gallbladder surgery,said Friday after meeting with leaders of political parties alliedwith the Communists: ``We don't need suggestions for theimprovement of socialism that are really intended to cause itsdemise,''   It was his toughest statement yet on opposition movements, whichhave grown in strength at time of unrest at home and flight to theWest by tens of thousands of young skilled workers.   A Communist Party position paper called opposition groups``enemies of the socialist order.''   East German opposition leader Werner Fischer said in a telephoneinterview with West Germany's ARD television the Communist Party``is only open to reforms as long as its own power is assured.''   Honecker's political future remained the subject of speculation.Some reports have said he is about to be removed from office.   Die Welt, a newspaper based in Bonn, quoted West German InteriorMinister Wolfgang Schaeuble as saying East Germany was ``in apre-revolutionary state.''   As of Friday, Honecker's picture had not appeared in theCommunist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland for three days, butstate TV did show footage of him greeting the political delegationFriday.   Wolfgang Seiffert, a former adviser to Honecker who defected toWest Germany, said in West Berlin ``the majority of the Politburoblames Honecker for the current crisis.''   In his remarks Friday, Honecker urged East Germans to worktogether for ``continuity and renewal, through deep-seated changeand reform,'' an apparent response to the public demand. He madeclear, however, that ``the leading role of the party'' would remainintact.   Echoing an earlier Politburo statement about the flight to theWest, he said: ``It must concern us all when our citizens, forwhatever reasons, turn their backs on their country. Open dialogueis necessary to make Socialism more and more attractive.''   Growing discontent has forced the leadership to adopt a moreconciliatory line. Ranking officials have indicated there could bechanges in the rigidly controlled media, but sharp attacks continueto be aimed at opposition groups.   The party position paper said ``open and hidden enemies of thesocialist order'' could create a mass movement at odds with thegovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
