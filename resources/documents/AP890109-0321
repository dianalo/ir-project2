Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan wasn'timmediately available for comment today, nor were National MediationBoard Chairman Walter Wallace and mediator Harry Bickford, who wasjoined by Wallace for talks beginning last Friday at the SheratonHotel in Key Largo, Fla.   The Eastern-Machinists negotiations went into federal mediationnearly one year ago after direct negotiations stalemated. Wallacejoined Bickford in an effort to get the talks moving, but sourcesspeaking on condition of anonymity said there had been virtually noprogress during the lengthy weekend sessions.   Eastern has been pressing for federal declaration of an impasse,which would begin a 30-day cooling-off period. After the 30 days,the union could strike and the company could impose its own workconditions.   Eastern says only the pressure of a deadline, which the mediatorshave refused to set, will get the negotiations moving. The union hasclaimed Eastern wants to provoke a strike so it can try to break itand bust the union.   Eastern put out a bulletin to its employees Sunday reporting thatthe Machinists' lead negotiator had walked out. William Scheri, thenational Machinists' union airline chief negotiator, hadparticipated for the first time in the Eastern mediation lastweekend, but left Key Largo on Sunday.   ``Mr. Scheri's sudden departure after the Wallace announcement of`no deadline' for these talks reinforces our previously statedbelief that the IAM will not take the talks seriously until the NMBstarts the 30-day cooling off period,'' the company bulletin said.   However, the mediators said they had been informed earlier thatScheri planned to participate only through the weekend beforereturning to Washington headquarters of the InternationalAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.   The two sides, who last met in intense mediation in July, havebeen some $200 million apart. The Machinists, representing 8,500mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground service workers, ormore than one-fourth of Eastern's employees, were seeking a $50million raise.   Eastern was seeking $150 million in concessions, mostly from thenon-mechanics.   Eastern, which reported $233.7 million in losses for the firstthree quarters of 1988, has lobbied vigorously for declaration of animpasse.</TEXT></DOC>
