The committee approved the criminal statute 28-6 after chairmanJack Brooks, D-Texas, promised to back a constitutional amendmentif the legislation failed to overcome a Supreme Court ruling thatflag burning was a protected form of free speech.   The Democratic leadership intended to rush the bill to the Housefloor next week, before the August recess, in hopes of furthercalming demands for amending the Constitution and of defusing theissue.   However, parliamentary objections today by Republicans forced adelay in floor action until after the House returns in September.   The statute provides penalties of up to a year in jail plus afine, the amount of which is not specified, for anyone who burns orotherwise physically desecrates a flag.   In a sometimes raucus meeting, Brooks ruled out of order thesecond Republican attempt in two days to substitute aconstitutional amendment for the regular statute supported by theDemocratic leadership.   ``This statute is a mess, and it's obvious it's a mess fromeverything we've seen and heard this morning,'' said Rep. ChuckDouglas, R-N.H.   Douglas offered several amendments designed to derail thestatute, including a modified version of the constitutionalamendment supported by President Bush and House Minority Leader BobMichel, R-Ill.   Although other Republicans supported his amendments, Douglas wasthe only one who voted against the statute.   Five Democrats, leery of any infringement of free speech, votedagainst it, including Rep. John Conyers of Michigan who offered anamendment of his own to ban cross burnings.   ``Cross burnings for centuries have been more of a problem inthe United States than flag burnings,'' said Conyers, who was alsoruled out of order by Brooks.   Democratic leaders have made clear they intend to allow passageonly of a statute before the August recess.   ``As a matter of prudence and principle we must try thestatutory route'' before tampering with the First Amendment, saidRep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., as the committee on Wednesday openedconsideration of the flag bill.   Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y., appealed to the Democrats to giveRepublicans a chance to offer amendments to the bill when itreaches the full House, probably next week. Brooks indicated,however, that the bill will be brought up under an expeditedprocedure that blocks any amendments.   Bush effectively used the flag against the Democratic nominee,Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, in last year's presidentialelection.   Since then, Democrats have been ``running scared whenever thequestion of the flag has been raised,'' said Rep. George Crockett,D-Mich., a committee member who agrees with the Supreme Courtdecision that flag burning is a constitutionally protected form ofpolitical protest.   Although most lawmakers of both parties condemned the ruling,Bush set the political battle lines in Congress when he embracedthe constitutional amendment at a ceremony at the Iwo Jima memorial.   By passing a statute before the August recess, House SpeakerThomas S. Foley, D-Wash., hopes Democrats can take care of the flagand cool the rush for a constitutional amendment.   Foley and the other top Democrats contend the statute introducedby Brooks can pass constitutional muster because it does not takeinto account whether the flag burning or other mutilation was partof a protest or similar act.   The court, in its 5-4 ruling, specifically objected to a Texasstatute that outlawed flag burning when it was an offensive act.   The Brooks bill makes an exception so that veterans groups andothers can continue to dispose of old, worn-out flags, for whichburning is the traditional method.   The bill also provides for the law to get expedited review bythe Supreme Court.   The Senate has scheduled votes on both the amendment and astatute in October.</TEXT></DOC>
