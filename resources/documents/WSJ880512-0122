Yet today's &quot;Polish question&quot; remains the Polish question asked a year ago and 40 years ago: How does a society of Roman Catholics share power with a government of totalitarian Communists?    &quot;We are condemned to reach some agreement with the state,&quot; says Witold Trzeciakowski, an economist with ties to both the independent trade union, Solidarity, and the church. &quot;The alternative is another eruption, or chain of eruptions, dangerous for Europe and tragic for us.&quot;    The strikers at the Lenin Shipyards in Gdansk marched home Tuesday evening, having given up their demand for a legal branch of Solidarity, illegal now for almost six years. The state gave up something, too. In a bill passed yesterday by parliament that gave it special powers to enforce its economic-reform program, the state dropped harsh anti-strike provisions while maintaining existing limits on work stoppages. Officials spoke of the need to seek society's support anew.    But after two weeks of trying to mediate this crisis, the state's most-sought-after partner -- the church -- was feeling betrayed.    Since late 1986, when they freed Solidarity's political prisoners, Poland's rulers have toyed with formulas for widening political participation without sacrificing the Communist Party's monopoly on power. They created a &quot;consultative council,&quot; but only a few opposition moderates would give it a try. They even held, and lost, a national vote on economic reform. The Poles weren't impressed.    The one sign of credibility the opposition wanted was the one sign the state wouldn't give: legalization of Solidarity. It was a note sounded often, and again last week, by the U.S. government. But after two weeks of frustration, the argument seemed to wear thin.    Even Solidarity's leader, Lech Walesa, admitted yesterday that the strikes &quot;showed our strength as well as our helplessness.&quot; Others were more harsh. While the opposition yearns for democracy, said Marcin Krol, a Catholic writer and intellectual, &quot;they don't have fresh propositions on how to get it.&quot;    But with the state more desperate than ever for popular approval, the chances could improve for smaller steps toward genuine pluralism. The government has &quot;no choice but to seek solutions,&quot; says Prof. Trzeciakowski. &quot;They understand that to preserve the leading role of the party in the military, foreign affairs and internal security, they must resign from a leading role in economic affairs.&quot;    A few tiny steps have already been taken. Since June, Mr. Krol has been publishing Poland's first legal magazine with ties to neither church nor state. In Krakow, officials approved an organization that wants to help private businesses.    The existing consultative council, Prof. Trzeciakowski argues, should have its members elected as representatives of society's various constituencies. And the bodies that send them ought to be autonomous. Mr. Krol goes further: &quot;It cannot be consultation; it has to be participation -- a council for the economy where proposals can be negotiated.&quot; And Jerzy Wiatr, a sociologist and a moderate within the Communist Party, goes further still.    &quot;Let your imagination run wild,&quot; he says. &quot;A prime minister with several Catholic ministers in his cabinet. Paradoxically, this situation may make that arrangement more feasible. {Polish President Wojciech} Jaruzelski is clearly weakened. The church may be inclined to give him a hand.&quot;    No Pole would question the church's potential as the one partner the state feels it can trust. Judging from the way the state treated it in this crisis, though, the potential partners are feuding already.    When strikes broke out at the Nowa Huta steel mill near Krakow and at the Lenin Shipyards, the bishops of Gdansk and Krakow offered to mediate. Missions from the Club of Catholic Intellectuals sped to both sites on May 3. Talks began.    Poland's bishops issued a statement full of hope for &quot;dialogue.&quot; That same day, the church and state happened to reach tentative accord on their knottiest problem: diplomatic relations with the Vatican and legal recognition, at last, of the Polish Church.    But early the next morning, after talks at Nowa Huta seemed to adjourn positively, police broke the strike. Headlines proclaimed an agreement with the Church, cheek by jowl with stories about Nowa Huta's submission to force. &quot;The Church felt it had been put in a trap,&quot; says Catholic writer Krysztof Sliwinski.    The bishops issued an angry statement. Pope John Paul II spoke out for workers' right to strike. And in a Sunday sermon, Primate Jozef Glemp discounted the church's role as mediator. Picking up the pieces will take some doing. Yet there is one sign of good faith. It has more to do with money than with morals.    For three years, until 1986, the state thwarted the church's efforts to set up a $1 billion fund to help farmers. The church gave up. But after the pope's visit in June, the idea was revived. The state allowed an independent water-supply project backed by $10 million from the U.S. government. The church wants more from the Italians, the West Germans. It wants an ecological foundation, an export foundation. The state has set no limits.    &quot;As long as it goes under the protection of the church,&quot; says Prof. Trzeciakowski, who heads the church agricultural committee, &quot;the state isn't afraid.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
