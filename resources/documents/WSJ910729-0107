The disclosure, to be made at briefings with consultantsand reporters, is to be the first of a series of attempts byIBM to regenerate some enthusiasm for the high end of itsproduct line. That is crucial because weak mainframe demandand plunging prices helped turn the first half into adisaster and have made third-quarter prospects anemic.</LP><TEXT>   A spokeswoman for IBM, Armonk, N.Y., declined to comment.But securities analysts and consultants said they expect IBMto indicate tomorrow that each of the central processors inits new mainframes has turned out to operate at 45 to 46mips, or million instructions per seconds, a standard measureof computing performance. That would be up from the initialindication of 40 to 41 mips that IBM gave when it announcedthe machines last fall. IBM was apparently trying to beconservative with its initial estimate of performance, lestsnags develop in the year between announcement and delivery.   &quot;That's a big increase in this class of machine,&quot; said DanMandresh, a securities analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.   That increase in rating could help IBM sell its machinesat closer to list price, cutting into the discounts thatindustry executives have said can range to 40%-45% on newmainframes. Still, that wouldn't necessarily get IBM out ofthe woods. The IBM-compatible mainframes sold by Hitachi DataSystems Corp. contain processors that are already rated atthe speed IBM is just now claiming. There is also speculationthat HDS -- a joint venture between Japan's Hitachi Ltd. andGeneral Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems unit -- willannounce in coming months that it, too, lowballed its speedestimates; an HDS spokesman said he couldn't comment becausethe company is still studying the matter. In any case, AmdahlCorp.'s IBM-compatible machines will contain processors ratedat some 50 mips when they become available late this year. SoIBM should continue to face considerable competition inmainframes.   Despite recent rumors that IBM will have trouble meetingits promise to begin deliveries this quarter, it is expectedto say at the briefings that everything remains on track. BobDjurdjevic, a consultant with Annex Research Inc., Phoenix,says he has checked with several customers expecting machinessoon and hasn't found any change in delivery schedules.   Keeping to its delivery schedule would let IBM preservethe one advantage it has, at least in the short term. Itsmachines will hit the market a few months ahead of Amdahl's,and HDS doesn't yet have the manufacturing capacity toproduce many machines.   The analysts and consultants said IBM is expected to tryto step up the pressure in September with a wave ofannouncements that will flesh out its new mainframe line andincrease by 50% the storage capacity of its high-end diskdrives.   IBM is expected to introduce low-end mainframes that useone, two and three processors, to complement the four-, five-and six-processor machines IBM has already unveiled. In aless-powerful series of mainframes -- cooled by air, notwater -- IBM is to announce machines using three and fourprocessors, to go with the existing one- and two-processorversions.   IBM is also expected to announce disk drives that canstore 33 gigabytes -- the equivalent of some 16 milliontypewritten pages -- up from the current capacity of 22gigabytes. That will be important because HDS, afterstumbling early this year, has done well against IBM with aseries of disk drives equivalent to the current IBM line, anddisk drives are nearly as profitable for IBM as are itsflagship mainframes.   The announcements could well produce a respectablefourth-quarter for IBM despite slower economic growthoverseas and the stronger dollar, which reduces the value ofoverseas profit when it is translated back into dollars. ButMr. Mandresh, for instance, is still just expecting full-yearearnings of $4.85 a share, not including a large specialcharge taken in the first quarter for an accounting change.That would be down more than half from last year's $6.02billion, or $10.51 a share. He is expecting revenue to slip3.6% to $66.5 billion. So, with this year already written offas a disaster, the question is how much momentum IBM cancarry forward into next year.   IBM stock closed Friday at $100.50, unchanged in compositetrading on the New York Stock Exchange.
