The 1987 treaty calls for signatory nations to reduce``consumption,'' defined as production plus imports and minusexports, to 1986 levels by July 1 of next year.   A 20 percent cut must be in place in 1992 and a further 30percent cut in 1998.   The chemicals affected are the chlorofluorocarbon or CFCcompounds, practically indestructible refrigeration fluids,foam-blowing agents, cleaning solvents and, outside North Americaand Scandinavia, aerosol propellants. They have found wide usebecause they are non-toxic and do not burn.   A related set of bromine compounds, the halons used forfire-fighting, are to be frozen at 1986 levels in 1992.   The July 1 reduction will represent a sizable cut in actualusage. Figures kept by the U.S. International Trade Commissionshowed a 12.6 percent increase for 1987 compared with 1986 inproduction of the two most common chemicals in question, and mostobservers expect 1988 production to increase again.   These chemicals can last for a century and more in theatmosphere, rising slowly to the ozone layer 15 to 25 miles highwhere their chlorine atoms are liberated to destroy ozone. Ozoneprotects the Earth's surface from the harmful ultraviolet rays ofthe sun.   Scientists blame such chlorine for the annual October ``hole'' inozone over Antarctica, which some years sees high-altitude ozonefall by 50 percent, and a decline in ozone over mid-latitudes of upto 3 percent since about 1960.   Each percent decline in ozone can represent a 4 percent to 6percent increase in skin cancer, according to the EnvronmentalProtection Agency.   These effects have led EPA and many scientists to call forrevision of the treaty to ban these chemicals altogether, andseveral major manufacturers have said they will end all production.A scientific review called for by the treaty is under way, but theearliest the signatory nations could consider it under proceduresnow in force is April 1990.   The treaty terms called for it to go into effect when ratified byat least 11 countries representing two-thirds of world consumption.Although 15 countries with a majority of world consumption hadratified before Friday, they did not make the two-thirds mark.   With Friday's ratifications, ``It's certainly well abovetwo-thirds,'' said Martine Coursil of the United Nations EnvironmentProgram in New York. But she did not have the exact share ofconsumption represented by the ratifications.   In addition to the European Economic Community, these countriesnotified the United Nations of ratification Friday: Britain,Denmark, West Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands andSpain.   According to Friends of the Earth, an environmental group thathas kept track of ratifications, the pact was ratified earlier by:   Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Canada, Egypt, Japan,Kenya, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Portugal,Sweden, Uganda, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the SovietUnion and the United States.   Twenty-two other countries have signed the treaty but not yetinformed the United Nations of ratification. The only majorindustrialized country in this group is France.   ``It's a significant achievement, and it will be even moremeaningful once the agreement is strengthened,'' said Liz Cook ofFriends of the Earth.</TEXT></DOC>
