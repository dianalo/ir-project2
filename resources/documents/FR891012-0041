Accordingly, this proposal providesthat petitions for wastes managed in a hazardous waste unit must includeground-water monitoring information, if a ground-water monitoring systemfor the unit is required under 40 CFR part 264 or 265, or equivalent authorizedState requirements. Such petitioners should have adequate ground-watermonitoring systems in place and should be conducting regular ground-watermonitoring, except as specifically provided otherwise in 40 CFR part 261,264, or 265. Facilities will be required to provide the following informationas part of their petitions: A description of site geology and hydrology;a description of the ground-water monitoring systems for the units in whichthe petitioned waste is managed; the results obtained from the analysisof ground-water samples collected pursuant to 40 CFR part 264 or 265 orauthorized State equivalent; a discussion of sampling and analytical proceduresfollowed; and an interpretation of the information and data presented.The petitioner must also submit any additional ground-water informationnecessary to characterize the petitioned waste's impact on ground-waterquality, including the analyses of ground water for any constituent deemednecessary by EPA. Alternatively, the petitioner may specify the titlesof reports containing this information and identify the State or EPA Regionalauthority which has possession of the submitted reports. The Agency hasin the past evaluated and will continue to evaluate ground-water monitoringdata, where appropriate, as well as other factors (<T3>e.g., </T3>waste constituent concentrations, mobility, pH, and reactivity)during the delisting petition review process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>EPA will accept public comments on this proposed rule untilNovember 27, 1989.

Authority</ITAG>This regulation is issued under the authority of sections 2002(a) and 3001of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended (42 U.S.C. 6912(a) and 6921).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>On January 16, 1981, as part of its final and interim final regulationsimplementing section 3001 of RCRA, EPA published an amended list of hazardouswastes from nonspecific and specific sources. This list has been amendedseveral times, and is published in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32. These wastesare listed as hazardous because they typically and frequently exhibit oneor more of the characteristics of hazardous wastes identified in subpartC of part 261 (<T3>i.e., </T3>ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and extraction procedure(EP) toxicity) or meet the criteria for listing contained in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(2) or (a)(3).Individual waste streams may vary, however, depending on raw materials,industrial processes, and other factors. Thus, while a waste that is describedin these regulations generally is hazardous, a specific waste from an individualfacility meeting the listing description may not be. For this reason, 40CFR 260.20 and 260.22 provide an exclusion procedure, allowing personsto demonstrate that a specific waste from a particular generating facilityshould not be regulated as a hazardous waste. The petitioner makes thisdemonstration by submitting manufacturing and treatment process information,raw materials lists, analytical data, mass balance arguments, and otheradministrative information.To have their wastes excluded, petitioners must show that wastes generatedat their facilities do not meet any of the criteria for which the wasteswere listed. See 40 CFR 260.22(a) and the background documents for thelisted wastes. In addition, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA)of 1984 require the Agency to consider any factors (including additionalconstituents) other than those for which the waste was listed, if thereis a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factors could causethe waste to be hazardous. Accordingly, a petitioner also must demonstratethat the waste does not exhibit any of the hazardous characteristics (<T3>i.e., </T3>ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity, and EP toxicity),and must present sufficient information for the Agency to determine whetherthe waste contains any other toxicants at hazardous levels. See 40 CFR260.22(a), 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and the background documents for the listedwastes. Although wastes which are ``delisted'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>excluded) have been evaluated to determine whether or notthey exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous wastes, generatorsremain obligated to determine whether or not their waste remains nonhazardousbased on the hazardous waste characteristics.In addition to wastes listed as hazardous in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32,residues from the treatment, storage, or disposal of listed hazardous wastesand mixtures containing hazardous wastes also are eligible for exclusionand remain hazardous wastes until excluded. See 40 CFR 261.3 (c) and (d)(2).The substantive standard for ``delisting'' a treatment residue or a mixtureis the same as previously described for listed wastes.In the past, the Agency requested that petitioners submit ground-watermonitoring data for the waste management units which contained the petitionedwaste. This ground-water monitoring information was evaluated as part ofthe submitted petition on a case-by-case basis. In April 1985, the Agencypublished a guidance manual to assist facilities in preparing delistingpetitions. See ``Petitions to Delist Hazardous Wastes_A Guidance Manual,''U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste (EPA/530-SW-85-003), April 1985. This manualinformed petitioners that ground-water monitoring data would be collected,if available, from State and EPA Regional offices for consideration duringpetition reviews.The Agency has also used (and currently uses, where appropriate) analyticalmodels, such as the vertical and horizontal spread (VHS) model and theLand Treatment Model (LTM), to evaluate the mobility of toxicants fromland-disposed wastes. See 50 FR 48896, November 27, 1985; 50 FR 48961,November 27, 1985; and 51 FR 41095, November 13, 1986. The Agency has relied,and currently relies where appropriate, on these models to quantify thepotential hazards of a petitioned waste.For wastes that contain toxic constituents (<T3>i.e.,</T3> constituents listed in 40 CFR part 261, Appendix VIII),the listing criteria require the Agency to consider a number of factorsin determining if the waste poses a ``substantial present or potentialhazard to human health or the environment.'' 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3). Thesefactors include the ``potential of the constituent to migrate from thewaste into the environment.'' 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)(iii). In delisting evaluations,the Agency normally assesses the potential for migration from the wasteinto the ground water. Although EPA uses models to predict the movementof waste constituents, EPA views ground-water monitoring data from an adequatewell system as important information in determining that the petitionedwaste has not had or could not have an adverse impact on ground water.Therefore, the Agency routinely evaluates ground-water monitoring datafor petitions involving on-site and dedicated off-site land-based hazardouswaste units.The Agency recognizes that modelling, by definition, is less accurate inpredicting hazards at a particular site than data that reflect hazardsposed by the actual disposal of a specific wastestream at that particularsite. However, wastes which have been delisted may be disposed of at numerouslocations where the hydrogeological and other conditions may vary substantially.Predictive models, therefore, are necessary to evaluate the hazards posedby disposal of specific wastestreams.When data can be obtained to characterize the effects of past disposalpractices for a given wastestream, the Agency believes this data will complementthe use of predictive models. Such waste-specific data provide significantadditional information that the Agency believes is important to characterizefully the hazards posed by disposal of a particular waste. For example,ground-water monitoring data from a particular site at which a specificwaste was disposed may reflect contamination (<T3>e.g.,</T3> exceedance of health-based levels). Such data clearly indicatethat the specific waste is hazardous at one location, and thus is potentiallyhazardous at many other locations.EPA is proposing today's amendments to 40 CFR 260.22 to clarify the authorityof the Agency to consider ground-water monitoring data as part of the evaluationof delisting petitions, and also to clarify the ability of the Agency torequire such data from petitioners. (EPA is not soliciting, and will notrespond to, comments on other existing elements of the delisting programor regulations.) EPA will require petitioners to submit, as part of delistingpetitions, ground-water monitoring data sufficient to characterize theeffects on underlying aquifers of waste disposed of at on-site and dedicatedoff-site hazardous waste units, if such units are required to have a ground-watermonitoring system under 40 CFR part 264 or 265. EPA will not require suchground-water monitoring data from nondedicated off-site hazardous wasteunits for delisting petitions, because the ground-water data from suchunits would not provide useful information about the petitioned waste.In other situations, EPA will not require petitioners to provide this additionaldata, because ground-water monitoring data cannot be obtained (<T3>e.g.,</T3> in cases where petitioners have requested upfront delistings).<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Overview of Ground-Water Monitoring Requirements Under 40 CFRParts 264 and 265</ITAG>Facilities that have not yet received final administrative dispositionof their Part B permit application (<T3>i.e.,</T3> facilities with interim status) are required to comply with40 CFR part 265. All other regulated subtitle C facilities managing hazardouswastes in on-site land disposal units are required to comply with a permitissued under 40 CFR part 264. As explained below, subpart F in both part264 and part 265 generally require facilities that treat, store, or disposeof hazardous wastes in on-site surface impoundments, waste piles (40 CFRpart 264 only), landfills, or land treatment facilities to implement aground-water monitoring program that evaluates the ground-water qualityin the uppermost aquifer underlying the facility. (See 40 CFR 264.90(a),265.90(a)).Interim status facilities are required under 40 CFR part 265, subpart F,to install a ground-water monitoring system capable of determining thefacility's impact on the quality of ground water in the uppermost aquifer.Under 40 CFR 265.92 and 265.93, facilities are required to sample groundwater at specified time intervals and to determine whether statisticallysignificant increase (or for pH, increases and decreases) of indicatorparameters (<T3>e.g.,</T3> specific conductance, pH, total organic carbon, total organichalogen) over background have occurred. If a statistically significantincrease (or for pH, an increase or decrease) of an indicator parameterover its background level occurs, then the facility must develop and implementa ground-water assessment plan approved by the EPA Regional Office or theauthorized State.RCRA-permitted facilities are required under 40 CFR part 264, subpart F,to install a ground-water monitoring system capable of detecting hazardousconstituents that have entered the uppermost aquifer. RCRA-permitted facilitiesmust sample ground water at specified time intervals and determine whetherthe levels of constituents or parameters specified in their permit haveincreased (or for pH, increased or decreased) statistically over background.If a statistically significant increase (or for pH, an increase or decrease)in a constituent or parameter is detected, the facility must develop andimplement a compliance monitoring program (including immediate testingfor constituents listed in Appendix IX to part 264 and, thereafter, anannual scan for all Appendix IX constituents) meeting the requirementsof 40 CFR 264.99. If the levels of any constituent being monitored arefound to exceed the concentration limits specified in the facility permit,the facility must prepare and implement a corrective action program inaccordance with 40 CFR 264.100.<ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Use of Ground-Water Monitoring Data in Delisting Decisions</ITAG>Today's proposed amendment to 40 CFR 260.22 codifies the Agency's policyto require individuals who submit delisting petitions (under 40 CFR 260.20and 260.22) for wastes managed in on-site (or off-site dedicated) hazardouswaste management units to provide ground-water monitoring information aspart of their petitions, if the units of concern are required to have ground-watermonitoring systems under 40 CFR part 264 or 265. Generally, facilitiesthat have submitted delisting petitions for waste managed in land-basedhazardous waste management units already are required to monitor groundwater under 40 CFR part 264 or 265, subpart F. Thus, ground-water informationand analytical data should be readily available and can be provided foruse in the delisting evaluation without any significant cost to petitioners.Petitioners will be required to provide the following information as partof their petitions: A description of site geology and hydrology; a descriptionof the ground-water monitoring systems for the units in which the petitionedwaste is managed; the results obtained from the analysis of ground-watersamples collected pursuant to 40 CFR part 264 or 265, subpart F; a discussionof sampling and analytical procedures followed; and an interpretation ofthe information and data presented. The petitioner must also submit anyadditional information necessary for evaluating the petitioned waste'simpact on ground-water quality, including the analyses of ground waterfor any constituent deemed necessary by EPA. EPA will consider failureto submit any of the above information as grounds for denial or dismissalof the delisting petition.Facilities that have submitted delisting petitions for wastes managed indedicated off-site units are also required to provide the above ground-watermonitoring information, if these units are required to have a ground-watermonitoring system under 40 CFR part 264 or 265. A dedicated off-site unitis a hazardous waste management unit, located apart from the facility proper,in which no hazardous waste other than the petitioned waste is managed.If the dedicated off-site unit is not under the petitioner's control, thepetitioner must arrange to provide the required information. The Agencyis not requiring ground-water monitoring information from nondedicatedoff-site units because such data would likely reflect constituent concentrationsfrom numerous, codisposed hazardous waste streams. Thus, this data wouldhave little value to the Agency's evaluation of the petitioned waste.The Agency will, however, require the petitioner to submit ground-waterdata for all on-site units that contain the petitioned waste, includingthose units that also contain other wastes (i.e., nondedicated units) ifthe unit is subject to RCRA ground-water monitoring requirements. The Agencybelieves that such data may provide useful information for delisting becausethe petitioned waste is often a significant component of the waste containedin on-site, nondedicated units. As noted above, off-site nondedicated unitsare more likely to be large facilities that accept a wide variety of wastes.EPA will evaluate the importance of ground-water and other informationfor on-site nondedicated units on a case-by-case basis.In general, the petitioner is required to submit ground-water monitoringinformation and analytical data for all ground-water wells that monitorthe unit(s) in which the petitioned waste is managed. All available analyticalresults for upgradient and downgradient monitoring wells should be submitted.The Agency will normally require at least four rounds of monitoring datacollected over the course of one year unless, in the judgment of EPA, datafrom a shorter time period are adequate to evaluate the impact of the petitionedwaste on the ground water. The submitted data must represent any expectedseasonal variation in ground-water quality. If the petitioner has previouslysubmitted ground-water information in response to RCRA subpart F requirements,the petitioner may either resubmit the information in the delisting demonstration,or specify the titles of the reports containing the required informationand identify the State or EPA Regional contact who has possession of thesubmitted reports. The Agency will coordinate with State and EPA Regionalcontacts to obtain this information, when appropriate. The Agency retainsthe authority to request the petitioner to submit additional informationnecessary for the delisting evaluation, if the reports submitted to theState or EPA Region are not adequate for this purpose.This proposal also explains how the Agency intends to use the submittedground-water monitoring information to support delisting decisions. Ground-watermonitoring data from EPA Region or State-approved RCRA monitoring systemsthat show no unacceptable toxicant levels (<T3>e.g., </T3>hazardous constituent concentrations above health-basedlevels) may support the Agency's decision to grant an exclusion. However,because the monitoring data from a particular site do not reflect the potentialto contaminate other sites, these data alone are not sufficient evidenceto grant an exclusion. The evaluation of many factors (<T3>e.g., </T3>waste constituent concentrations, pH, and reactivity) andthe Agency's evaluation of toxicant mobility from wastes using ground-watertransport models (<T3>e.g., </T3>the VHS model) may contribute to the final delisting decision.If the Agency believes that under reasonable worst-case conditions a wastewill leach unacceptable levels of toxicants, then the Agency may considerthe waste to be hazardous and subject to subtitle C control even thoughground-water monitoring data may not indicate ground-water contamination.Ground-water monitoring data showing no contamination indicate that eithercontamination has not yet occurred or has not been detected, but do notindicate whether the waste will cause ground-water contamination in thefuture at the site assessed or at other potential sites. In addition, becausewastes may be moved to a different location following exclusion, the evaluationof ground-water monitoring data from the current location will have nodirect bearing on possible migration from a similar unit at a differentwaste management site which may have different hydrogeological conditions.On the other hand, ground-water monitoring data that show ground-watercontamination may support the Agency's decision to deny a petition, evenwhen leachate test results and modeling evaluations would not indicatepotential ground-water contamination. The Agency intends to use resultsof ground-water monitoring data evaluations as a check on the reasonableworst-case evaluations performed in order to provide an additional levelof confidence in its delisting decisions. Because ground-water monitoringdata are descriptive of the impact of the petitioned waste under actualconditions, and not reasonable worst-case assumptions, the Agency believesthat evidence of ground-water contamination originating from the unit(s)of concern may be a sufficient basis for petition denial.A. Incomplete Delisting InformationThe Agency's policy to dismiss incomplete petitions by letter is explainedin detail in 53 FR 6822, March 3, 1988. Petitions that are substantiallyincomplete may be dismissed upon receipt. Facilities with petitions thatare partially deficient will have a maximum of 6 months to submit the informationnecessary to complete their delisting petitions. In the event that the6-month deadline passes without full submittal of the requested information,the Agency may dismiss the petition by written notice to the facility.The effect of the dismissal is to remove the petition from the petitionreview process and to close the petition file. The facility may submita new petition with updated and complete information at any time.Pursuant to this policy, the Agency will notify facilities when submittedground-water monitoring information is insufficient to complete their petitions.Such incomplete petitions may be dismissed upon receipt or the facilitymay be given a maximum of six months within which to provide the necessaryground-water monitoring information.B. Non-compliant Monitoring SystemsIn most cases, the Agency will dismiss petitions for wastes in on-siteand dedicated off-site waste management units if ground-water monitoringis not in compliance with the applicable 49 CFR part 264 or 265, subpartF ground-water monitoring regulations and such lack of compliance, in EPA'sdiscretion, renders the ground-water monitoring data insufficient to properlycharacterize the impact of the petitioned waste on ground water. Compliancewith supart F regulations will be determined after consultation with theappropriate State or EPA Regional offices. Such petitions generally willbe dismissed upon finding the system out of compliance, because more thansix months will typically be required to bring the monitoring system intocompliance and/or to collect the requisite ground-water monitoring data.A facility may submit a new petition with updated and complete ground-watermonitoring information after the ground-water monitoring system is broughtinto compliance and the required sampling information has been obtained.If data submitted from non-compliant monitoring systems indicate that thepetitioned waste may have caused ground-water contamination, the Agencymay use this information to support a denial of the petition. The Agencybelieves that these data may be used as a separate basis to deny the petitionbecause the ground-water monitoring results, even though the monitoringsystem is not in compliance, may indicate that the petitioned waste hasadversely affected ground-water quality at the site. The petitioner maysubmit a new petition if the monitoring system is brought into compliancewith the appropriate regulations and may attempt to provide sufficientinformation to demonstrate that the petitioned waste has not contributedto ground-water contamination.In most cases, ground-water monitoring systems approved by the EPA Regionor State will provide the data necessary for evaluating the impact of thepetitioned waste on ground-water quality. In a few cases, however, a petitioner'sapproved ground-water monitoring system may not be adequate for determiningthe impact of only the petitioned waste on ground-water quality. For example,the EPA Region or State may have granted approval of a single ground-watermonitoring system for a waste management area. A waste management areais defined by an imaginary line circumscribing more than one regulatedunit. A well system which monitors several regulated units within a singlewaste management area may be inadequate for determining the petitionedwaste's impact on ground-water quality where, for example, the petitionedwaste is found only in one unit. Such situations will be evaluated on acase-by-case basis.Other cases in which data from an approved ground-water system will notbe adequate may arise for units that are subject only to the monitoringrequirements in subpart F of 40 CFR part 265. The list of analytes requiredunder part 265 is limited in scope and often will not include constituentsthat are of concern to EPA in evaluating delisting petitions. Therefore,EPA will require that petitioners provide ground-water analyses for anyconstituents that the Agency believes may be derived from the petitionedwaste and might adversely affect ground-water quality.C. Identification of Ground-water Contamination<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Evaluation of Hazardous Constituent Concentrations</ITAG>In evaluating a delisting petition, the Agency will consider to be unacceptableground-water contamination that exceeds health-based levels in wells thatmonitor the units containing the petitioned waste. The health-based levelsare Agency-reviewed levels of regulatory concern proposed for use in delistingdecisions (see ``Docket Report on Health-Based Regulatory Levels and SolubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988, locatedin the RCRA public docket). These levels include Maximum Contaminant Levels(MCLs) developed for drinking water, as well as Reference Doses (for noncarcinogens)and Risk Specific Doses (for carcinogens). Health-based levels are intendedto protect humans from the possible adverse effects of chronic, low levelexposure to hazardous constituents.The Agency is aware that the ground-water monitoring regulations in subpartF to 40 CFR part 264 appear to take a somewhat different approach in evaluatingcontamination. Under part 264, detection of hazardous constituents in theground water above certain concentration limits (ground-water protectionstandards) triggers the requirement for corrective action. These concentrationlimits are based on: (1) Maximum concentration limits for drinking waterspecified in part 264, (2) alternate concentration limits (ACLs) establishedin a permit to protect human health and the environment, or (3) backgroundlevels. (Subpart F to part 265, unlike part 264, does not provide any specificmechanism for corrective action. The focus of the part 265 regulationsis on determining the extent and nature of ground-water contamination,not on its removal or treatment. The use of health-based levels in delistingground-water evaluations is not inconsistent with subpart F to part 265,because part 265 does not contain procedures for evaluating what levelsof constituents are unacceptable and require corrective action.)The use of health-based levels (including MCLs) in evaluating ground waterfor delisting is clearly consistent with the use of MCLs and ACLs as ground-waterprotection standards in part 264, subpart F. (ACLs are site-specific limitsdeveloped from health-based levels similar to the levels used in delistingdecision-making.) For delisting purposes, however, the Agency generallywill not use constituent levels above background as a sole basis for petitiondenial. EPA believes that health-based levels are more relevant to thedelisting decision process; the delisting process determines which wastesare hazardous to human health and the environment, whereas subpart F isdesigned to protect human health and the environment by detecting and addressingreleases from regulated and solid waste management units that could contaminateground water.Furthermore, this apparent difference of approach with part 264 subpartF has little practical impact. If increases above background are detectedin ground water, the Agency's delisting program will await the submittalof the further ground-water date required under subpart F (i.e., AppendixIX to part 264) before determining if health-based levels are exceededfor any constituents of concern to delisting. In addition, today's proposedrule will require petitioners to analyze the ground water for any constituentdeemed necessary by EPA for the delisting evaluation. If significant ground-watercontamination exists at a site, it seems highly unlikely that no constituentsof concern would be found above health-based levels. Finally, as notedpreviously, EPA Headquarters plans to coordinate closely with EPA Regionaland State permitting authorities to ensure that any evidence that the petitionedwaste has caused a ground-water problem is evaluated prior to delisting.The exceedance of the health-based levels in ground-water samples collectedfrom monitoring wells located hydraulically downgradient from a regulatedunit in which the petitioned waste is managed indicates that the petitionedwaste may be leaching constituents at levels of concern to the delistingprogram. Ground-water contamination in exceedance of health-based levelsmay provide grounds to deny a petition unless the petitioner can demonstrateone of the following: (1) The petitioned waste has not contributed to thecontamination (<T3>e.g.,</T3> contamination is the result of other on-site sources), (2)the exceedance is due to an error in sampling or analysis or other factorsnot associated with the petitioned waste, or (3) the exceedance, althoughgreater than the health-based levels, is not statistically significant.The Agency will review these demonstrations on a case-by-case basis.(1) If the evaluation of ground-water monitoring information shows thatconstituent concentrations in the background (or upgradient) wells designatedby the facility also exceed health-based levels, the petitioner will berequired to demonstrate that the constituent concentrations in the background(or upgradient) wells are the result of a contaminant source other thanthe petitioned waste, and are not in fact related to factors such as inappropriatewell construction or placement, ground-water mounding effects, or site-specifichydrogeologic factors that might cause background (or upgradient) wellsto intercept flow from the petitioned unit.If contamination is indicated in a downgradient well, a facility may attemptto demonstrate to the Agency's satisfaction that a source other than thepetitioned waste caused the contamination. Such a demonstration may requirethat petitioners perform sampling and analyses in addition to 40 CFR part264 or 265, subpart F requirements. This demonstration may include informationsuch as background ground-water quality, waste composition data, mass balancedemonstrations, results of the chemical analysis of other potential contaminantsources, and process and treatment information.(2) The Agency also will consider a facility's claim that an exceedanceis the result of an error in sampling or analysis. The petitioner mustprovide an explanation of why the error has occurred and sufficient datato show the exceedance is not representative of actual ground-water quality.Such a demonstration may include the presentation of field and laboratoryQA/QC data (<T3>e.g.,</T3> equipment blanks, trip blanks, laboratory blanks, replicates).(3) A facility may show that a constituent concentration, which is abovea health-based level, is not a statistically significant exceedance. TheAgency has approved the use of a variety of statistical methods for evaluatingground-water monitoring data from hazardous waste facilities. However,the appropriateness of a given procedure is governed by specified performancestandards which require that the use of a statistical test be determinedon a case-by-case basis. See the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, October 11, 1988, 53 FR 39720. Examples of acceptedstatistical procedures are an analysis of variance (ANOVA), a toleranceor prediction interval procedure, and control charts. Guidance materialsare being developed that will discuss the tolerance interval method andan alternative confidence interval method of analysis that may be usedin certain circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Evaluation of Indicator Parameters and Constituents</ITAG>The results of indicator parameter analyses (<T3>e.g.,</T3> pH, specific conductance, total organic carbon, or totalorganic halogen) submitted in support of a facility's delisting demonstration,and any indicator parameter analyses obtained from State and EPA Regionaloffices, will be evaluating according to statistical procedures set forthin 40 CFR part 264 or 265 as appropriate. If this evaluation shows thatthere has been a statistically significant increase (or for pH, an increaseor decrease) over background levels of an indicator parameter, the RCRAregulations require that the facility submit additional ground-water monitoringdata to determine the concentrations of hazardous waste constituents inground water (see 40 CFR parts 264 and 265, subpart F).Part 264 also requires that facilities sample for constituents specifiedin their permit, and for all part 264 Appendix IX constituents if an exceedanceof the specified constituents or parameters occurs. For delisting purposes,the Agency will require the submittal of this constituent data in orderto demonstrate that levels of hazardous constituents in ground water arenot exceeding health-based levels. In addition, today's proposed amendmentsto the delisting regulations require that petitioners submit ground-waterdata for any constituent deemed necessary by EPA (see andSection; 260.22(i)(13)).EPA will usually require ground-water monitoring data (to include hazardousconstituent analyses) collected over the course of at least one year.If an evaluation of indicator parameter analyses shows that a statisticallysignificant increase (or for pH, an increase or decrease) over backgroundconcentrations in the level of an indicator parameter has not occurred,the Agency may still require, for delisting purposes, that a petitionerperform additional sampling and analyses for one or more hazardous constituents.Similarly, the Agency may require analyses for constituents not specifiedin the permit, even without an exceedance for specified constituents orparameters. The request for additional information would be made when theAgency has sufficient reason to suspect that such constituents in the wastecould have an adverse effect on ground-water quality. EPA Headquarterswill coordinate with appropriate State and EPA Regional offices in determiningthe adequacy of existing ground-water monitoring data in demonstratingthat the petitioned waste has not adversely affected ground-water quality.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Evaluation of Vadose Zone Monitoring Data</ITAG>In some instances a petitioner may be monitoring the vadose zone (i.e.,the unsaturated zone between the waste and the ground water) in order todetect hazardous constituents migrating from a waste management unit beforeground water has been adversely affected. Such a program is particularlyadvantageous and necessary when a waste management unit is located in aregion where depth to ground water is substantial. The Agency intends touse vadoze zone monitoring data, when it is available from the petitioneror is required by EPA Regional or State authorities, to support the evaluationof a waste's potential impact on ground water and the environment. Shouldan analysis of vadose zone monitoring data indicate that contaminationof the vadose zone has occurred or is occurring, the Agency may determinethat the petitioned waste could cause ground water contamination if itwere to migrate to ground water, or if, once excluded, the waste was transportedto a disposal site with different hydrogeologic properties (<T3>e.g., </T3>a shallow water table). The Agency will coordinate withappropriate State and EPA Regional offices in determining whether vadosezone monitoring data demonstrate that the petitioned waste is capable ofadversely impacting ground water and the environment.D. Impact on Future Hazardous Waste GeneratorsThe Agency recognizes that some petitioners may be planning to generatenew wastestreams that would be listed in 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32 oncegenerated. These petitioners may request an ``upfront'' delisting, submitpilot-scale waste constituent data, process descriptions, and other informationin support of their delisting demonstrations prior to full operation ofthe new process. If these data and the information in the remainder ofthe petition demonstrate that the waste is not hazardous, the Agency maygrant an upfront exclusion. Obviously, ground-water monitoring data forsuch wastes are not physically obtainable.For an upfront delisting, the conditions of the exclusion will set maximumallowable constituent levels in the waste and will require the facilityto submit representative sampling and analytical results from the full-scaleprocess to verify that the allowable levels have been met in the generatedwaste. Such upfront delisting will be granted only when the Agency hassufficient reason to conclude, based upon information submitted about theprocess and waste and upon the conditions of the exclusion, that nonhazardouswastes will be generated.E. Impact on Facilities Planning To Treat Stored WastesThe Agency has received and currently is reviewing a number of petitionsfrom facilities that are using various procedures (<T3>e.g.,</T3> stabilization, incineration, leachate treatment) to treatand to reduce constituent mobility in appropriate waste matrices. In atypical case, a petitioner may stabilize wastes contained in a land-basedhazardous waste management unit. In all cases, petitioners must demonstratethat the treatment procedures are effectively reducing constituent mobilityand/or concentrations to levels that are below regulatory concern.Ground-water monitoring information from units used to store wastes priorto treatment will not be required for petitions for treated waste becausethe treatment process is expected to alter the chemical composition ofthe waste and/or the mobility of the waste constituents. Ground-water monitoringfor the original unit, therefore, generally will not provide useful informationon the impact of the treated waste on ground-water quality. If a petitionfor treated wastes is submitted on an upfront basis (<T3>i.e.,</T3> before the waste is treated), ground-water monitoring datafrom the treated wastes will not be physically obtainable. For wastes thathave already been treated and placed in a new unit, ground-water monitoringdata from the new unit will be required for delisting purposes, if theAgency believes that such data would be useful in evaluating the hazardsof the treated waste.EPA's decisions to delist a waste are generally retrospective and typicallyremove the waste management units holding the delisted waste from controlunder subtitle C of RCRA. In effect, the Agency has decided that theseunits have not received a hazardous waste. However, if waste from a hazardouswaste management unit is treated and subsequently delisted, the unit inwhich the untreated waste was managed is not necessarily removed from regulationunder 40 CFR parts 262 through 268 and the permitting standards of 40 CFRparts 270. Delistings also may be prospective and remove from subtitleC control only the waste sampled or newly disposed/generated waste. TheAgency believes that the unit from which the untreated waste was removedshould remain regulated until any hazardous residues remaining from disposalof the original (untreated) waste are managed to meet applicable requirementsunder RCRA (<T3>e.g.,</T3> clean closure requirements), or until these residues receivean exclusion based on a separate delisting petition. Before the unit itselfcould be removed from regulation, the petitioner must demonstrate (throughground-water monitoring and other data) that residues remaining at theunit that contain or are derived from the original (untreated) waste arenot hazardous and that past waste management practices at the unit havenot caused ground-water contamination.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Effective Date</ITAG>This rule, when promulgated, will be effective immediately. Although SubtitleC regulations normally take effect six months after promulgation (RCRAsection 3010(b)), the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amendedsection 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effective in less than sixmonths when the regulated community does not need the six-month periodto come into compliance. Because today's rule merely clarifies the Agency'sexisting authority to require any additional information needed to evaluatea petition (see 40 CFR part 260.22(j)), the Agency believes that a six-monthdelay is unnecessary. In addition, a six-month deadline is not necessaryto achieve the purpose of section 3010 and good cause exists to make therule effective immediately upon promulgation. These reasons also providea basis for making this rule effective immediately, upon promulgation,under the Administrative Procedure Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. State Authority</ITAG>A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized StatesUnder section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administerand enforce the RCRA program within the State. (See 40 CFR part 271 forthe standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization,EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 7003, and 3013 ofRCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility.Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendment (HSWA) of 1984, a Statewith final authorization administered its hazardous waste program entirelyin lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federalrequirements no longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could notissue permits for any facilities in the State that the State was authorizedto permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgatedor enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority withinspecified timeframes. New Federal requirements did not take effect in anauthorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.In contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirementsand prohibitions imposed by the HSWA take effect in authorized States atthe same time that they take effect in non-authorized States. EPA is directedto implement those requirements and prohibitions in authorized States,including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorizationto do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as Statelaw to retain final authorization, the HSWA applies in authorized Statesin the interim.B. Effect on State AuthorizationsAt this time, only a few States are authorized to administer the RCRA delistingprogram. EPA currently administers the RCRA delisting program in otherStates and territories.Today's announcement proposes standards that would not be effective inauthorized States because the requirements would not be imposed pursuantto the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. Thus, the requirementswill be immediately applicable upon promulgation only in those States thatdo not have authorization. In authorized States, the requirements willnot be applicable unless the States revises its program to adopt equivalentregulations under State law and the State revisions are authorized. Ifa State is authorized for delisting, its program must be no less stringentthan that of the Federal Program for the State to obtain and keep finalauthorization. Today's rule proposes to clarify EPA's exercise of its existingauthority by codifying specific requirements to consider ground-water monitoringdata as part of the Agency's evaluation of delisting petitions. EPA believesthat this additional specificity of delisting regulations makes the delistingprocess more stringent. Therefore, the State program must include equivalentregulations in order for the State to obtain and to keep final authorization,upon promulgation of these requirements.40 CFR 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final authorizationmust modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and mustsubsequently submit the modifications to EPA for approval. The deadlineby which the State must modify its program to adopt this proposed regulationwill be determined by the date of promulgation of the final rule in accordancewith 40 CFR 271.21(e). These deadlines can be extended in certain cases(40 CFR 271.21(e)(3)). Once EPA approves the modification, the State requirementsbecome Subtitle C RCRA requirements.States with authorized RCRA programs already may have requirements similarto those in today's proposed rule. These State regulations have not beenassessed against the Federal regulations being proposed today to determinewhether they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State will not beauthorized to carry out these requirements upon their promulgation in lieuof EPA until the State program modification is submitted to EPA and approved.Of course, States with existing regulations may continue to administerand enforce their regulations as a matter of State law.States that submit their official applications for final authorizationless than 12 months after the effective date of these standards are notrequired to include standards equivalent to these standards in their application.However, the State must modify its program by the deadlines set forth in40 CFR 271.21(e). States that submit official applications for final authorization12 months after the effective date of these standards must include standardsequivalent to these standards in their application. 40 CFR 271.3 sets forththe requirements a State must meet when submitting its final authorizationapplication.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact AnalysisUnder Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and, therefore, subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.A major rule is defined as a regulation that is likely to result in:<ITAG tagnum="15">1. An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2. A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies or geographic regions; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">3. Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.</ITAG>The Agency has determined that today's proposal is not a major rule. Ifpromulgated, this proposal would not significantly increase cost to thepetitioner because the information requested in today's proposal generallyshould be available from facilities in compliance with 40 CFR part 264or 265, subpart F. In addition, facilities have been given the option ofspecifying the titles of reports containing the requested information andidentifying the State or EPA Regional contact who has possession of suchreports, in lieu of resubmitting this information as part of the delistingapplication. Finally, EPA could require submission of this informationunder existing authority, so no significant cost of providing this informationwill be attributable to this proposed rule.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a General Notice of Rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e.,</T3> small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis is required, however,if the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities.This amendment will not have an adverse impact on a substantial numberof small entities, since the information requested in today's proposalgenerally is already required of petitioners under 40 CFR part 264 or 265,subpart F and 40 CFR part 270, subpart B, and can be requested under existingdelisting authority. Accordingly, I hereby certify that this regulationupon promulgation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This regulation, therefore, does not requirea regulatory flexibility analysis.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThe Information collection requirements in this proposed rule have beensubmitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) underthe Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> Reporting and recordkeeping burden on the public for thiscollection is estimated to be 1,550 hours for the 50 respondents per year,with an average of 31 hours per petition. These burden estimates includeall aspects of the collection effort and may include time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, completing and reviewing the collection of information,etc.If you wish to submit comments regarding any aspect of this collectionof information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, or if youwould like a copy of the information collection request (please referenceICR #1189), contact Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460 (202-382-2745),and Paperwork Reduction Project 2050-0053, Office of Management and Budget,Washington, DC 20503. The final rule will respond to any OMB or publiccomments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII.
