 At least in part, this is because desktopcomputers now form the technology base on which large publishing systems arebuilt.andM;To a publisher, desktop computers are a mixed blessing.andP;  It's wonderful thatyou can do so much with hardware and software that is so cheap, but thelimitations (poor to nonexistent file routing, job tracking and multiuserprotections) are vexing.andP;  Therefore, the publishers who come to the Seminarspay close attention to the strategic plans and product announcements of thedesktop vendors.andM;Vedors of desktop-oriented products have a slightly different perspective.andO;They see the profesional publishing market as a rather specialized,low-volume niche; the entire professional market is at most a few thousandusers.andP;  The real money is in selling to the mass market, where a modestlysuccessful product might find a few hundred thousand customers.andM;The reason that desktop vendors cater to the high-end publishing market isthat here they can find the most knowledgeable, most demanding users and themost challenging applications.andP;  The features and solutions that meet theneeds of professionals today will be saleable in the wider market in a yearor two.andP;  To the desktop vendors, the high-end publishing market is one bigmarketing focus group.andM;Trends.andP;  If we step back a bit and take a long view of where the publishingindustry is going, here's what we see.andP;  First of all, the technology base isstill evolving.andP;  In the 1980s, the large-systems technology based onminicomputers matured and a new desktop technology based on microcomputersemerged.andP;  The new technology will soon mature; nearly all of the necessarycomponents exist separately now.andM;In the 1990s, the new driving force for technological change will come fromthe consumer electronics industry.andP;  We are already moving toward a commondigital technology for every kind of information: print, sound, live video,synthetic and animated images, archival storage and so on.andP;  Consumerelectronics is predicated on large markets, and enomonies of scale will bewhat drives the technology.andM;Rethinking roles.andP;  Under the impact of technology change, the old barriersand distinctions between the crafts are breaking down, and people are beingforced to rethink their roles.andP;  In publishing, we have a shift from separatecrafts of writers, photo editors, type compositors, color separators,printers and so forth to an integrated process in which work flows back andforth.andP;  We still have people with diverse skills and specialties, but noweach specialist must know more about the abilities and constraints of hisfellow specialists.andP;  It's not enough to work on a projet and then &quot;throw itover the wall&quot; to the next specialist with the expectation that it's nowsomebody else's problem.andP;  Instead, publishing systems will have to supportinteraction and collaboration--jamming, to use the musical term--and thepublishing innovations of the '90s will put an emphasis on managing theprocess as a whole.andM;Information 'smart bombs.'andP;  One of the most interesting trends ahs to do withthe increasing ability to deliver information only to audiences who areinterested.andP;  Newspapers are one example: they now routinely carve up theirmarket into neighborhood-sized zones and charge for advertising space basedon which zones it will reach.andP;  Magazines classify their readersdemographically and can bind in different inserts for each class.andP;  Publishersare learning how to weave past the readers' defenses, targeting theirmessages like smart bombs.andM;But notice: As this process intensifies, and particularly when we move intoelectronic delivery systems, an interesting thing happens.andP;  Along withpublishers guessing which information might interest a class of readers, wehave customers using their computers to search out and receive informationthey want.andP;  Instead of a supply push, we have a demand pull.andM;Open color systems.andP;  We are seeing real progress toward open color systems.andO;There is now widewpread agreement on what is needed, and several majorvendors are investing a lot of energy in providing it.andP;  The key decktopplayers--Adobe, Apple, HP, Kodak, Microsoft--are learning to work with thetraditional vendors--Crosfield, Hell, Screen and Scitex--who in turn areadapting to the reality that the desktop is driving their future markets.andM;Other key trends:andM;* The emergence of color management systems from EFI, Kodak and others.andM;* The &quot;de-skilling&quot; of color correction--that is, encapsulating in softwarethe expertise that once took years of apprenticeship to learn.andP;  An example isCachet, Linotyp-Hell, Optronics and others.andP;  issue.andM;* The availability of high-quality screening algorithms for PostScript coloroutput from Adobe, Linotype-Hell, Optronics and others.andM;Where to read all about it.andP;  In the pages that follow, we will present thoseparts of the seminar sessions and the product announcements that are relevantto the desktop publishing market.andM;The next two issues of the Seybold Report on Publishing Systems will containour report on higher-end issues and products from the Seminars.andP;  Because thedistinctions between &quot;desktop&quot; and &quot;professional&quot; publishing continue toblur, readers of either Report should find useful information in both.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
