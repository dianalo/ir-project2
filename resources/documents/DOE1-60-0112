The resultsfrom the Multivariate Analysis of Variance procedure which does the simultaneouscomparison of the chosen response variables are presented. The assumptionsfor this test procedure are given. Problems which could affect the validityof the statistical procedures for the endurance test are discussed. Datafrom a 200-hour EMA laboratory screening endurance test is used to illustratethe statistical methods. Results from the statistical analysis of theexperimental data were in close agreement with the engineering interpretationof the observed differences between fuels. Critical engineering interpretationof the statistical results is still required due to the high sensitivityof the statistical analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
