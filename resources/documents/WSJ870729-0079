At a recent cable-television convention in Las Vegas, executives of HBO were aghast to see a billboard truck whizzing around town bearing the slogan &quot;HBO andamp; Showtime: It's Not Either/Or Anymore.&quot; HBO executives then saw conventioneers carrying cookies, buttons, tote bags and other items bearing the same slogan.    Blame it on rival pay-TV network Showtime, a Viacom Inc. unit. Frustrated with trying to beat a competitor twice its size, Showtime hoped to persuade subscribers they had to buy both services to see all the exclusive programs available on cable.    But HBO, a unit of Time Inc., wasn't crazy about that approach. It filed suit in federal court in New York, arguing that people would think the two companies had merged, or that HBO was sponsoring the ad campaign. HBO contended that the disclaimers used by Showtime were &quot;calculated to escape ordinary notice.&quot; HBO lawyers measured cookie packages and buttons, and found the disclaimers in letters &quot;barely 1/16 of an inch&quot; high.    Last week, a federal judge denied HBO's request for an injunction and said Showtime could use the slogan in a new fall ad campaign -- with a ditty sung to the tune of the old Lovin' Spoonful hit &quot;Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?&quot; But the ads must include a prominent disclaimer that HBO &quot;does not sponsor this advertisement or recommend the Showtime Service in combination with HBO.&quot;    Says an HBO lawyer of the decision, &quot;I'd say it was a draw.&quot;    Billy Bob's Back   Billy Bob Harris and Paul Thayer, two former targets of the Securities and Exchange Commission, are quietly and not so quietly returning to private life after spending 15 months in a federal prison. Mr. Thayer, a former LTV Corp. chairman and deputy defense secretary, and Mr. Harris, a former stockbroker, pleaded guilty in 1985 to lying to SEC officials investigating an insider-trading case.    Mr. Harris has rejoined the Dallas social swirl, turning up at fashionable parties even before he was released from a halfway house last December. In addition to taking a job with a real-estate firm, Mr. Harris is back at KVIL, a popular Dallas radio station for which he previously did a variety of programs including daily stock market reports. Mr. Harris isn't doing the stock reports, but he did do a one-week stint as a helicopter traffic reporter.    &quot;We had a few people say it was out of line to put Billy Bob on,&quot; says Ron Chapman, KVIL's program manager. &quot;But 95% of the response was: 'It's so good to have Billy Bob back.'&quot;    The more reclusive Mr. Thayer, released from the same halfway house in December, recently took a job at Computerbase International Inc. in Irvine, Calif. As a director and president of a division developing a computer system aimed for the Defense Department, Mr. Thayer gets no salary, but will receive Computerbase stock based on his performance.    Says Richard Manweller, Computerbase president: &quot;Obviously the biggest asset he brings to us is the knowledge that he does have and people that he knows, who all are behind him, by the way.&quot;    Same Old Story   What's so special about NBC's &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;?    Certainly not the idea, says a federal judge. And NBC officials are grateful.    The judge ruled recently in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court by Hwesu S. Murray. In 1980, Mr. Murray, a unit manager at NBC Sports, submitted an idea for a new show to NBC's entertainment division. The show would star Bill Cosby as head of a middle-class black family with five children, the eldest away at college. Both parents would be professionals, and the show would avoid stereotypes about blacks in favor of family situations.    The network rejected the idea. But after NBC began broadcasting the similar-looking &quot;Cosby Show&quot; in 1984, Mr. Murray sued for misappropriation and fraud.    NBC lawyers argued that Mr. Murray's idea wasn't novel enough to sue over -- although in pretrial depositions, NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff crowed that &quot;Cosby&quot; added &quot;a new and unique dimension to the American television family-program genre.&quot;    Federal Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum believed the lawyers. In dismissing the suit, she said that there is no reason &quot;a program based on the life of a middle-class black family and resembling the 'Dick Van Dyke Show' or 'Father Knows Best' should be considered novel.&quot;    Mr. Murray's lawyers plan to appeal. &quot;If this decision becomes law it will be impossible for anything to be novel again,&quot; lawyer Joseph J. Santora says. </TEXT></DOC>
