Phone numbers were selected randomly bycomputer and interviews were conducted with the adult in eachhousehold who had the most recent birthday.   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in thesample.

The error margin is larger for subgroups _ fivepoints, for example, for Republicans.   There are other sources of potential error in polls, includingthe wording and order of questions.
