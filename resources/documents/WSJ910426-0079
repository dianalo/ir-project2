The loss cut the computer and defense-electronicscompany's net worth to $3.6 billion, perilously close to the$3.5 billion net worth Unisys must maintain under the creditagreement. The company, based in Blue Bell, Pa., could reachthat threshold this quarter if, as securities analystsexpect, it has another loss the size of the first quarter's.If Unisys takes further restructuring actions -- as itindicated it might -- any charge could push Unisys below therequired level.</LP><TEXT>   Going below that level isn't likely to pose a problem forUnisys, at least for the next few quarters. Its relationswith its banks have been cordial, and some bankers haveindicated they would let Unisys violate the net-worthcovenant or renegotiate it. Technically, violation of thenet-worth covenant would trigger a credit crunch for Unisys.But the banks might welcome such a violation if it resultedfrom Unisys selling assets to reduce debt or taking morecharges to reduce costs.   &quot;Our lenders have been extremely supportive,&quot; said JimUnruh, chief executive, at the annual meeting here. &quot;However,in today's environment we must show them significant 1991progress on debt. We must reduce our dependence onborrowing.&quot;   In its earnings report, Unisys said it still plans tomaintain a $3.5 billion net worth. It did add, though, that&quot;in light of the weaker-than-anticipated environment thecompany is re-evaluating that plan.&quot;   Speaking to a sometimes hostile crowd of about 300, Mr.Unruh added that &quot;we do not yet have the right cost structurein place to achieve profitability in this unfavorableeconomic and industry environment.&quot;   He said the company would cut employment to less than70,000 by year end, from 75,000 at the start of the year and72,000 at the end of the first quarter -- although most ofthose reductions are covered under a 5,000-person cut thatUnisys announced late last year. Mr. Unruh also said Unisysmight close more facilities this year, even though thecompany has already cut factories to 19 from 36 over the past4 1/2 years.   In addition to the previously reported plans for a majorasset sale, Mr. Unruh said large task forces are looking forcost savings and ways to turn smaller assets into $300million to $500 million in cash this year. If those effortssucceed, Mr. Unruh said, the company could easily exceed itsgoal of cutting debt to some $3.1 billion at year end from$3.87 billion at the end of the first quarter. Debt actuallyrose $100 million in the first quarter, but the companydismissed that as a planned move.   &quot;We recognize that the turnaround of Unisys is not aone-year job,&quot; Mr. Unruh said. &quot;But we view 1991 as abreakthrough year.&quot;   The first-quarter loss of 79 cents a share widened fromthe year-earlier loss of $3.2 million, or 19 cents a share.The loss was, however, toward the low end of analysts'expectations, which ranged from 75 cents to $1 a share.   Some analysts took heart from that. Steve Milunovich ofSalomon Brothers, for instance, said he would improve hisforecast for 1991 to a loss of $1.50 a share from hisprevious estimate of a $2-a-share loss.   Revenue declined 11% to $2.06 billion from $2.31 billion.Sales, mostly of computer hardware, fell even more sharply,dropping 15% to $1.29 billion from $1.53 billion.   In addition to the debt problems that Unisys is strugglingwith -- and the worries those cause among customers -- Unisysblamed the loss and revenue drop on the world-wide economicweakness and pricing pressures that many computer companieshave seen so far this year. Unisys doesn't appear likely tothrow off those problems soon, as it said orders remaindepressed.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Unisys fell 37.5 cents to $4.50.</TEXT></DOC>
