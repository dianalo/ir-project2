Shares of MCI, the No. 2 long-distance phone company, gained more than a point late last week after the announcement of steps to cut costs and try to improve profitability. Friday, the stock closed up 1/4 at 7 3/4, and over-the-counter trading volume continued to be very heavy at 6.8 million shares.    Both bulls and bears on the company consider MCI's moves, which include laying off about 15% of its work force, a prudent response to a profit squeeze. But some analysts aren't sure the investors' enthusiasm is warranted. MCI's earnings growth, they say, depends more on the regulatory and competitive environment than it does on cost-cutting.    &quot;The reality is they have no control over their destiny,&quot; says Jack Grubman, a PaineWebber bear who looks at MCI as a pure play in an industry dominated by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph and run by regulators who want lower prices.    &quot;There are a lot of uncertainties out there,&quot; says Glenn Pafumi of Dean Witter Reynolds. &quot;The next two years are going to be very tough for this industry. Everyone's going to suffer.&quot;    MCI itself cautioned analysts at a meeting last week against adding the $150 million in anticipated cost savings onto next year's earnings estimates. While company officials are predicting 30% volume growth next year and flat operating expenses, they aren't yet making earnings or revenue forecasts.    &quot;If I were an analyst,&quot; MCI's chief financial officer, William E. Conway Jr., said, &quot;I would hold off on making an estimate of revenue and earnings&quot; until more is known about ATandamp;T price cuts scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1.    Nevertheless, the MCI bulls are ecstatic about last week's announcement, which also included cuts in capital spending, write-downs on obsolete equipment and a buyback of as many as 15 million shares.    &quot;It's a start-up company that's coming out of the start-up phase,&quot; says Daniel Zinsser of Goldman Sachs. &quot;For the first time, they are trying to look at not just growth but also controlling costs.&quot;    Rising costs and industrywide price cuts have been squeezing profit for ATandamp;T's competitors in the long-distance business. In the third quarter, MCI's profit before extraordinary items shrank to one cent a share. It is expected to earn a few cents a share from operations in the fourth quarter, but it will report a net loss because of a pre-tax charge of $500 million to $700 million for equipment write-downs and costs associated with the layoffs.    Meanwhile, US Sprint Communications, ATandamp;T's biggest competitor after MCI, had a pre-tax loss of about $160 million in its first three months of existence. The company was formed in July as a joint venture between GTE and United Telecommunications.    Wertheim analyst Lap Lee says MCI's shares should be valued by its cash flow rather than its earnings. On that basis, he considers the stock a good buy because it is trading at about 3.5 times his cash-flow estimate, compared with an average 7.5 multiple for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500.    &quot;I'm very enthusiastic on the basis that this company can be turned into a cash-generating business,&quot; he says.    Goldman's Mr. Zinsser sees a &quot;major improvement&quot; in MCI's profit margin beginning in mid-1987. He says its costs of connecting its long-distance network with those operated by local phone companies will soon stop rising as a percentage of revenue.    But even some who take a positive long-term view of the company express reservations. &quot;The major concern is how much further will prices be driven down,&quot; said Neil Yelsey, a Salomon Brothers analyst who has been recommending the stock.    An institutional holder who requested anonymity said he is generally more confident about MCI because of its cost-cutting moves but fears that the job reductions might slow growth. &quot;That's where the jury's out,&quot; he said. &quot;We will all find out over the next six months to a year.&quot;    Another looming problem is the possible entrance of the regional Bell operating companies into the long-distance business in a few years. &quot;That would be a whole different story, and a very bad story for competitors like MCI,&quot; says Michael Kennedy, an analyst at Gartner Group.    Bears such as Robert B. Morris III of Prudential-Bache also point out that US Sprint is turning out to be a more aggressive competitor than most people had expected.    Mr. Morris contends that, at current prices, MCI shares are &quot;either overvalued or fully valued.&quot; His reason: The shares are trading at a 160% premium over book value and about 15 times 1987 earnings estimates, without paying a dividend. </TEXT></DOC>
