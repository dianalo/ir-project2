The justices said they will review rulings that forced theLouisiana-based Jimmy Swaggart Ministries to pay California$183,000 in back taxes and interest for the years 1974 through 1981.   Lawyers for Swaggart's organization argue that the Californiatax, as applied, violates religious freedom.   A state appeals court rejected that argument, and the CaliforniaSupreme Court turned down an appeal by Swaggart's lawyers last Nov.17.   The disputed state sales and use tax is imposed on ``retailers''for the privilege of selling personal property in California, andon the consumption of products.   The tax was imposed on sales by the Swaggart ministry duringcrusades in California and sales made through the mails.   For the years at issue, mail-order sales from Baton Rouge, La.,to California consumers totaled $1.7 million. Sales of merchandiseat California crusades totaled $240,000.   The appeal acted on today argued, ``What could be a clearerviolation of the free exercise of the religion of the religiousadherent than to tax that adherent for exercising the right to usethe religious material distributed by the evangelist.''   The appeal relied heavily on a 1943 ruling in which the nation'shighest court overturned the convictions of Jehovah's Witnesses whoviolated a city ordinance requiring all people engaged indoor-to-door canvassing to get a license and pay a fee.   The Jehovah's Witnesses were distributing religious literature.   The court said in its 1943 ruling, ``This form of religiousactivity occupies the same high estate under the First Amendment asdo worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits.''   The California appeals court acknowledged the 1943 ruling andsaid, ``Evangelism, whether by age-old methods or by newtechnologies, is protected by ... the First Amendment.''   But the appeals court said the 1943 decision and other pastSupreme Court rulings have banned flat licensing taxes on religiousendeavors.   ``The Supreme Court did not equate a financial burden in and ofitself with an unconstitutional burden on the exercise ofreligion,'' the state court said.   The appeals court noted that in a 1983 decision striking down aMinnesota tax as discriminatory against certain newspapers, theSupreme Court said, ``Our cases have consistently recognized thatnondiscriminatory taxes on the receipts or income of newspaperswould be permissible.''   The state court concluded: ``A religious organization whichseeks to disseminate its religious message through sales ... shouldnot enjoy rights to communicate and distribute their messagesuperior to those of other organizations having social, politicalor other ideological messages to proselytize such as newspapers.''   The case is Jimmy Swaggart Ministries vs. Board of Equalization,88-1374.</TEXT></DOC>
