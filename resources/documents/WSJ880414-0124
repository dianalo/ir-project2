Harris Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> BA FREST UTX </CO><IN> ARO AIR </IN><TEXT>   Korean Air Lines ordered nine Boeing Co. 747 jumbo aircraft and took options for four others in a transaction with a potential value of nearly $2 billion.    The Seattle-based aerospace giant said it received &quot;firm&quot; orders from the South Korean carrier for six long-range, 398-passenger 747-400 models, which sell for about $135 million each and are designed for airlines' longest, most heavily traveled routes.    The Korean Air order also included two 747 freighters and one combination freight-passenger plane, bringing the total of the firm orders for aircraft and associated spare parts to about $1.5 billion. The freight and combination planes are to be delivered before the end of this year.    Boeing plans to begin delivering the 398-seat aircraft to Korean Air in March 1990. The airline already had three 747-400s on order, all with delivery scheduled for next year.    Each of the 747-400s will be powered by four Pratt andamp; Whitney 4000-series engines produced by Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp.    While the 747-400 has been among the most successful new models in Boeing's history, accounting for 124 orders from 18 airlines since the program was announced three years ago, the plane's delivery timetable has been threatened recently by a testing delay. The company still plans to receive Federal Aviation Administration certification in December, which Boeing believes will allow both Northwest Airlines, a unit of St. Paul, Minn.-based NWA Inc., and Singapore Airlines to receive their first two on schedule later that month.    But as previously disclosed, Boeing's first flight of the 747-400, planned for March, was held up by electrical problems associated with a new digital technology that is being installed on the planes. Yesterday, a spokesman said the first flight now is planned for late this month, and reiterated that the company expects to deliver a total of four aircraft before the end of this year.    Boeing has noted that if a delay did push into early 1989 the delivery of nearly $500 million of aircraft, it would reduce the company's projection of about $17 billion in 1988 revenue.    The latest order boosts to about $6 billion the value of the commercial aircraft that airlines have ordered from Boeing so far this year. The company has taken orders for 140 airliners in 1988. Last year at this time, Boeing had orders for only 67 planes, valued a total of $4.19 billion.    Boeing's 1988 orders have included 50 planes from Washington, D.C.-based USAir Group Inc., 20 from Lufthansa German Airlines and 22 from Ireland-based GPA Group Ltd., though all three of those multiplane orders involved the smaller, less-expensive 737 twin-engine jetliner.    The announcement of the Korean Air order came after the stock market closed yesterday. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing shares closed at $47.375, unchanged.    Korean Air has been involved in a modernization program for its 53-plane fleet, and has said it plans to add 25 new aircraft by early 1994. For 747-400s, which can fly 8,000 miles without stopping, two pilots are needed, as opposed to the three-member crew required for earlier 747 models. </TEXT></DOC>
