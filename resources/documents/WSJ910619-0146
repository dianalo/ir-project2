The lawmakers expect to introduce a program today thatwould require the White House science office to devise afive-year plan to improve the U.S. competitive position ineach of 22 technologies and increase research funding forthose technologies. The legislation would also financeregional centers to help small and medium-sized companiesdevelop and manufacture high-tech products.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We've got to plan for a way to support technologydevelopment in critical areas at a high enough level so wecan remain competitive,&quot; said Sen. Jeff Bingaman of NewMexico, who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee'sdefense industry and technology panel. The other senatorsbacking the plan are Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of theArmed Services Committee; Ernest Hollings of South Carolina,chairman of the Commerce Committee; and Albert Gore ofTennessee, who heads the science subcommittee.   The plan, contained in two bills, would authorize the U.S.to more than double its spending on advanced manufacturingtechnology and other &quot;critical technologies&quot; to $1.07 billionin the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. While it's highlyunlikely Congress would approve such a boost, the lawmakersin the past have been able to push through programs addingsubstantial new funds for commercial technologies.   Unlike past efforts, however, the new plan would increasefederal support to take commercial technologies beyond theresearch stage and into actual production. The White House,which in the past has resisted intervention in themarketplace, said it hasn't taken a position on the senators'plan.   The lawmakers are proposing two types of regional centersto get products to the market. One kind, called criticaltechnology application centers, would help companies in anarea design high-tech equipment, build prototypes and testthem. These centers would also provide training and marketingassistance. The other centers, called the nationalmanufacturing extension program, would help companies solveproblems they encounter in manufacturing new products.   Sen. Gore said the lawmakers weren't ready to backlegislation providing financing for high-tech companies, butsaid companies would gain &quot;bona fides&quot; from using the centersand should have an easier time raising funds from privatelenders.</TEXT></DOC>
