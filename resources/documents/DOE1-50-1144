These three systemsare of Cu{sub 3}Au structure. One terminal intermetallic compound ofeach of these systems is antiferromagnetic, while the other is paramagnetic.The focus of this study is to better define the salient features associatedwith the hybridization-driven magnetic to nonmagnetic transition seenin these systems. These studies of highly correlated systems impact onnumerous issues of considerable current interest, e.g., magnetic momentformation, Kondo lattice, heavy-fermion, itinerant or band magnetism,spin fluctuation, and spin-density waves. U(In,Sn){sub 3} system evolvesfrom the enhanced paramagnetic regime for USn{sub 3}, through a stronglyenhanced heavy-fermion regime and finally to an antiferromagneticallyordered regime. The results and the discussions for the U(Ga,Ge){sub3} and U(Sn,Pb){sub 3} systems are also given and compared to the resultsobtained for U(In,Sn){sub 3}. The systematic study of these pseudobinarysystems have led to some unusual behaviors which are manifestations ofthe change in the degree of localization of the 5f electrons, and moreof this information should provide a needed guide to further theoreticalattempts at establishing the salient features associated with heavy-fermionand magnetic-moment formation.</TEXT></DOC>
