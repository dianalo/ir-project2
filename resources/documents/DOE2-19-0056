<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-19-0056 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Dutch research program on the geological disposal of radioactive wastewas designed to supply a basis for the selection of combinations of threefactors, i.e., type of rock-salt formation, site, and disposal technique,satisfying radiological standards and other criteria for final disposal.The potential sites have been grouped according to the type of rock-saltformation (e.g. bedded salt and salt domes) and two classes of depthbelow the surface of the ground. Values for geohydrological parameterswere obtained by extrapolation of data from existing boreholes and analysisof the sedimentary environment. A three-dimensional model of groundwaterflow and contaminant transport, called METROPOL, has been developed.To investigate the effect of high salinity on nuclide transport properly,a theoretical experimental study was carried out. Use of a thermodynamicapproach showed that terms related to salt mass fraction have to be addedto Darcy's and Fick's laws. An experimental study to investigate effectsof these modifications is in progress. 8 refs.; 8 figs.; 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
