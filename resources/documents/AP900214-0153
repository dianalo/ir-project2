Garcia had been scheduled to leave Wednesday afternoon, forCartagena, Colombia, for the meeting with Bush and presidentsVirgilio Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia.   His departure was delayed until 5 a.m. Thursday, and he toldreporters at Government Palace that a full schedule was responsible.   But according to local press reports, Garcia disapproved of theoriginal schedule, which had the three Latin American presidentsarriving a day early and waiting for Bush, whose one-day visit isto be made under heavy security.   On Wednesday, Garcia presided over the ceremonial lowering ofthe Panamanian flag from above Government Palace, where he orderedit raised as a symbol of protest after U.S. troops invaded PanamaDec. 20 to oust Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Garcia ordered the flag to remain until U.S. troops were gone.The White House announced Tuesday that all invasion forced hadreturned home.   Garcia has been one of the region's most vocal critics of theinvasion. He announced in December he would not attend theCartagena summit, saying ``I cannot meet with the leader of aninvading nation.''   He also recalled Peru's ambassador to Washington in protest andbriefly halted Peruvian-U.S. anti-drug operations in the HuallagaValley.   Then on Feb. 2 Garcia reversed his decision after Bush said thetroops would be out by the end of February.   A Palace official, who asked that his name not be used, saidGarcia's plane would arrive in Cartagena about half an hour beforeBush's on Thursday morning.   Among those accompanying Garcia will be Foreign MinisterGuillermo Larco Cox and Peru's ambassador to Colombia, JavierPulgar.   Completing the entourage will be two officials from acoca-growers cooperative and a U.N. official who works with thecooperative in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, where most of thecountry's coca leaf is grown. Garcia invited the three along asobservers.</TEXT></DOC>
