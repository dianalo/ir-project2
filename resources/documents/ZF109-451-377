McCormick MCGEESMILLS, PENNSYLVANIA, U.S.A., 1990 AUG 3 (NB) -- I decided to change banks theother day.andP;  No, I didn't move, and their money market rates hadn't slipped(although they are already so low that practically everyone is flocking tobig mutual funds).andP;  No I am switching entirely because some managementdecisions were made about a computer system apparently without enoughunderstanding of the equipment or software.andM;A brand-new system had just been installed, as evidenced by a large sign ateach teller's station warning of possible long delays because of the newsystem, but it didn't take that sign to tell me what was wrong.andM;It took me about 12 minutes to obtain a cashier's check using the newcomputer system, a process that took about two minutes under the old system.andO;A small portion of this time was due to the teller not having had sufficienttraining and practice on the computer before being put online, but as Iobserved the system in operation I saw that most of the problem was very slowresponse from the new system, something that won't go away when the tellersbecome comfortable with it.andM;The new computer system also puts a terminal at each teller's window,requiring them to type a lot of information which would normally be enteredat one of the terminals along the back counter.andP;  Great; they can save time byquickly typing in the information without leaving the window, right? Wrong!andM;The tellers' windows have a high counter because they are used by the clerksto count out money in easy view of the customer.andP;  Unfortunately, this placesthe new keyboards almost under their chins and even ones who can touch-typehave to hunt-'n'-peck because the keyboard is so hard to reach.andM;Keeping track of its operation during that first use, I estimated that thenew computer will increase my waiting time by about four to six minutes pervisit, even when everything works perfectly.andP;  Since I had only marginalaffection for that bank to start with and there are others located just asconveniently, I will be trying them out next week.andM;With any luck, the other banks in our small town are not yet so automatedthat they can't still type out a check by hand.andM;Another computer literacy example is even more telling.andP;  I am the Chairman ofthe Data Processing Committee of a large organization which is in the processof installing a new computer system.andP;  Some of the more vocal members don'thave either home computers, fax machines, or access to e-mail bulletin boardsystems through work or home computers; thus, they are out of the loop onmost urgent decisions.andP;  Yet these same people feel that they are fullyqualified to comment on the limitations of microcomputers.andM;The main office staff balks at faxing information or answering questions overthe phone, insisting instead that personal visits are required - this despitethe fact that we are talking about technical details about a computer system,details which must eventually be put in writing anyway.andM;I would be happy to pay for a $100 modem connection out of my own pocket so Icould access their system directly from 500 miles away.andP;  It would save me alot of time and trouble and yield exactly the same information an on-sitevisit would provide, but the office manager can't conceive of such a use oftechnology.andM;For the present I am not even attempting to wean them from paper to e-mailservice through GEnie or MCI Mail, although the new system we are designingwill incorporate those features and I do have high hopes for the future.andM;The above are some examples of situations that will become more common or atleast more important in the future.andP;  We are faced with a new breed ofLuddites - not actual smashers, just people who get in the way and don't carethat much about applying the advances of modern technology.andM;These people fall into four general persuasions.andP;  Willful computer ignorance- the willingness to earn a living directly from the computer industry, whileremaining almost totally ignorant of computers.andM;Closet computer phobia - that is the only way I can describe the lack ofinterest in having a computer at home to learn something important about theindustry you have decided to work in.andM;Just plain ignorance - how else can you explain that, all these years afterthe computer revolution started, a large bank could purchase a new systemwithout learning how slow it would be, especially when other banks -competitors ready and anxious to grab their customers - are only a few blocksaway .andM;Computer arrogance - people who lack a comfortable relationship with commonlyused technology but nevertheless feel qualified to try to steer the course ofa major computer acquisition project.andM;But there is a bright light in all these tales of woe.andP;  Not that Americanschools are rapidly overcoming computer phobias, not that those put in chargeof computer systems are being required to learn something about them, andcertainly not that people are slowly coming to realize that ignorance is nota useful tool in solving problems.andM;No, the good news is that, as long as these problems are common occurrencesrather than rare incidents, those in the computer industry who are actuallysemi-competent will always have their choice of jobs, while the highlyqualified will have to beat off prospective employers with a joystick.andM;(John McCormick/1990617)</TEXT></DOC>
