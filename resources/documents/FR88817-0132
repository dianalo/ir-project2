(70-7350) </ITAG>New Orleans Public Service, Inc. (``NOPSI''), 317 Baronne Street, New Orleans,Louisiana 70112, a subsidiary of Middle South Utilities, Inc., a registeredholding company, has filed a post-effective amendment to its applicationwith this Commission pursuant to sections 6(a)(2) and 7 of the Act. By order dated May 12, 1987 (HCAR No. 24387), NOPSI was authorized to establisha new Mortgage (``Mortgage'') providing for the issuance of Rate RecoveryGeneral and Refunding Mortgage Bonds (``Gandamp;R Bonds'') and to issue andsell to institutional investors, $75 million of an initial series of Gandamp;RBonds, 10.95% Series due May 1, 1997 (``10.95% Bonds''). The 10.95% Bondswere issued under a First Supplemental Indenture to the Mortgage, which,in relevant part, granted the holders of the 10.95% Bonds (``Bondholders'')the right to tender such Gandamp;R Bonds to NOPSI for redemption upon theoccurrence of certain specified events. On February 4, 1988, the Council of the City of New Orleans adopted a resolution(``February 4th Resolution'') that required NOPSI to write off and notrecover from its retail electric customers $135 million of its Grand GulfSteam Electric Nuclear Generating Station, Unit No. 1 (``Grand Gulf 1'')related costs, which had been deferred for future recovery from customers,in addition to $51.2 million of previously incurred Grand Gulf 1 relatedcosts that NOPSI had absorbed as part of the Rate Settlement with the Cityof New Orleans, which Settlement provided for recovery by NOPSI of itsallocated share of costs associated with capacity and energy from GrandGulf 1. As a result, NOPSI was required by the terms of the Gandamp;R Mortgageto cause an independent arbiter to deliver to the Trustee a certificateindicating whether, in the independent arbiter's opinion, the February4th Resolution has currently materially impaired or prospectively willmaterially impair NOPSI's ability to perform its obligations in respectof all Gandamp;R Bonds outstanding under the Gandamp;R Mortgages. On June 24,1988, the independent arbiter issued a certificate stating that, as tothis issue, the opinion was affirmative and, thus, activated the Bondholdersrights to tender their Gandamp;R Bonds for redemption. In accordance withthe terms of the Gandamp;R Mortgage, on July 12, 1988, the Trustee notifiedthe Bondholders of their right to tender their Gandamp;R Bonds for redemption;that is, that the Bondholders electing to exercise this right were requiredto tender their Gandamp;R Bonds to the Trustee not later than August 11,1988 and that NOPSI would be required to redeem all outstanding Gandamp;RBonds so tendered on August 26, 1988. NOPSI states that the February 4th Resolution has had a substantial andadverse effect upon NOPSI's financial condition and cash flow and that,as a result, NOPSI would not have sufficient funds available to it to redeemthe Gandamp;R Bonds on August 26, 1988. In order to avoid having to redeemthe Gandamp;R Bonds, NOPSI now seeks authorization to enter into an agreementwith the Bondholders, whereby the Bondholders would agree to forbear fromtendering their Gandamp;R Bonds on August 11, 1988 and NOPSI would agree,subject to regulatory authorization, that, upon written notice from anyBondholder between November 24 and December 13, 1988, NOPSI would purchasethe Gandamp;R Bonds at a price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plusaccrued interest to the date of purchase; provided, however that the Bondholderswould not have the right to give such notice, and NOPSI would not be requiredto purchase any Gandamp;R Bonds, if an independent arbiter has delivereda certificate to each Bondholder on or prior to November 23, 1988 statingthat the impairment of NOPSI's ability to perform its obligations on theGandamp;R Bonds has ceased because of judicial or regulatory action. In addition,a Bondholder may revoke its notice of tender at any time prior to purchaseof its Gandamp;R Bonds. <ITAG tagnum="84">New Orleans Public Service, Inc.
