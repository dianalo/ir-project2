Much of the shock at Wednesday's rampage at the University ofMontreal was simply based on the view that such things do nothappen here.   ``It's part of a cultural tradition in Canada,'' said GaryMauser, a firearms control specialist and professor at Simon FraserUniversity in Vancouver, British Columbia. ``Canadians are muchmore law-abiding and more willing to believe that the law protectsthem. The Canadians trust their police more.''   An extensive study of attitudes in Canada and the United Statespublished in July by Maclean's magazine found that 3 percent ofCanadians own handguns, compared with 24 percent of Americans.   Marc Lepine, identified by police as the man who killed himselfafter Wednesday's shooting, purchased the weapon, a .223-calibersemi-automatic assault rifle, at a hunting store Nov. 21 for $510.   All gun purchases in Canada require a Firearms AcquisitionCertificate, which costs $8.50 and is available to anyone 16 yearsor older who does not have a criminal record or a history ofviolent behavior.   The certificate is renewable every five years, and there is nolimit to the number of guns that may be purchased.   Restricted weapons _ mostly handguns _ require an additionalregistration certificate. Automatic weapons are banned in Canada.   In the United States, the purchase of an automatic weaponrequires a special federal license, but regulations coveringsemi-automatics and other weapons are at the state and local leveland vary widely.   All buyers of firearms, however, must sign a federal formattesting they have not been convicted of a felony, judged mentallyincompetent by a court, or dishonorably discharged from the armedforces.   The Canadian government has been planning changes in its guncontrol law that would eliminate the import of some semi-automaticweapons that can be easily converted to full automatic firing.   Justice Minister Doug Lewis said Thursday in Ottawa the proposedchange would not affect weapons like the semi-automatic usedWednesday, because they are designed for hunting and are not easilyconverted to be fully automatic.   He said that, despite the tragedy, ``There are a great manyCanadians who appreciate the rules and laws we have. We've got apretty law-abiding country vis-a-vis firearms control.''   Lewis also said laws cannot guard against incidents like therampage at the University of Montreal. ``You can't legislateagainst insanity,'' he said.   Canadians long have considered the lesser violence on their sideof the border a keystone of national identity.   It was a major undertone to the fervent debate that precededapproval of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement last year, withopponents arguing that closer ties could bring in more aggressiveways.   ``My U.S. colleagues are often incredulous when they learn howlittle experience their Canadian counterparts have in treatinggunshot wounds,'' Andrew Pipe, a health columnist in Toronto'sGlobe and Mail newspaper, wrote recently.   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported 923,125 restrictedweapons in Canada as of the end of last year, most of them handguns.   In 1988, 158,972 certificates were issued, 1,192 applicationsrefused and 10,621 ``resulted in neither issuance nor refusal.''   Gun lobbyists have consistently argued against broadening guncontrol legislation.   But Svend Robinson, an opposition New Democrat legislator,criticized Lewis for delaying the proposed new legislation, whichhas been in the works since summer.   ``How many more tragedies of this nature must we see in thiscountry, before this Conservative government will finally act tokeep the commitments they made?'' he asked.</TEXT></DOC>
