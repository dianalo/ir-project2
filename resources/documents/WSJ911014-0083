They said the postponement will undercut IBM's all-outefforts to resuscitate OS/2 and go after Microsoft Corp.'sWindows product in the companies' battle for control of animportant part of the personal-computer market. Both productscontrol the basic functions of a personal computer, sowhichever company wins the battle will not only generatehefty revenue but will also set a standard that the rest ofthe PC industry must follow.</LP><TEXT>   The executives said the delay could even mark thebeginning of the end for OS/2. That's because IBM, which hadalready lost credibility on OS/2, had promised to get a greatversion out by the end of the year.   An IBM spokesman wouldn't comment directly on theprospects for a delay, saying only that &quot;we're in the processof finalizing our announcement and shipment dates.&quot; He saidIBM will provide further details at the Comdex trade shownext month. The industry executives said that announcementwill probably set the end of March as the new target date forshipments.   They said much of the reason for the delay is that IBMdecided it had to add more capability to its software, knownas OS/2 2.0. IBM had made a crucial promise last spring thatwas designed to undercut Windows' momentum: IBM said thatsoftware applications designed for Windows would work betterwith OS/2 than they would with Windows itself. But manypeople in the industry questioned whether IBM was living upto that promise once they saw details of the OS/2 version IBMplanned to release this year. So the industry executives saidIBM decided to delay the project rather than risk a flop.   Some of the executives also said IBM didn't think it couldget an important part of the user interface done on time.   IBM had set an incredibly aggressive development schedule,and a few months' delay is common on a project as complex asOS/2, so in other circumstances the OS/2 delay would causeminimal trouble. In fact, the industry executives said IBMshould earn some credit for delaying the product rather thanintroduce an inadequate version.   The problem for IBM is that it used $40 million inadvertising as a megaphone to broadcast its claims. Its chiefexecutive, president and other senior executives personallypromised customers and software developers at meetings lastspring that IBM would deliver on its OS/2 promises. JohnAkers, the chief executive, told some senior OS/2 executivesthat he'd have their badges if they failed, according topeople at those meetings who talked to the executives.   Those claims had generated skepticism, because IBM hadbeen flogging OS/2 since the spring of 1987 and had sold onlyabout 600,000 copies by this spring. By contrast, the latestversion of Microsoft's Windows has sold more than 10 timesthat many copies since its introduction less than a year anda half ago. To overcome that kind of disparity in thecomputer industry, a product usually has to be far betterthan its competitor, not just demonstrably superior.   But IBM is IBM, so many customers and software companiesdecided to give it one last chance. And as recently as twoweeks ago, IBM was vigorously denying that there were anyproblems with OS/2, according to a memo dated Sept. 27 that asenior executive sent to IBM's sales force.   &quot;Now IBM will probably have to stand by and watchMicrosoft enjoy a groundswell of support for Windows,&quot; saidRick Sherlund, a software securities analyst at GoldmanSachs. &quot;I think this raises questions about when they willactually ship and whether it'll really be better thanWindows.&quot;   Steve Ballmer, a senior vice president at Microsoft,declined to take any satisfaction from IBM's delay, eventhough the companies had exchanged words in public over thelikelihood that IBM would meet its goals. &quot;Our basic jobdidn't change one iota as a result of this,&quot; he said.Referring to two versions of Windows that Microsoft haspromised in coming months and years, he said: &quot;Our missionstill has to be the same. Work on 3.1, work on 3.1, work on3.1. Work on NT, work on NT, work on NT.&quot; But, he added, &quot;Younever get upset when your competitor messes up.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
