The stubborn fact of JudgeThomas's impressive qualifications for the job forces hisopponents to say some of the most amazing things.   There's the hypocrisy of Howard Metzenbaum's litmus testthat Judge Thomas must agree to vote to uphold Roe v. Wadeafter accusing President Bush of having the opposite litmus.But probably the most hilarious hypocrisy is thisrunning-joke discussion about &quot;natural law,&quot; a phrase that noSenator can define.</LP><TEXT>   The unseriousness of the natural-law issue is clear byremembering the accolades liberals gave Justices Brennan andMarshall when they advanced their common political agenda byditching original intent and instead invoking &quot;theconstitutional ideal of human dignity&quot; to find new rightshiding in the penumbras and shadows. Maybe liberals worrythat a conservative nominee could cite natural law to makeopposing arguments from the same playbook, but they also knowthat Judge Thomas was selected for his adherence to judicialrestraint.   When Senator Biden asked Judge Thomas if he would useambiguous natural law instead of applying the writtenConstitution, Judge Thomas gave the answer liberalssupposedly wanted to hear. He said he would not, that hisinterest in natural law was limited to political arguments hecould use when he ran the EEOC to broaden the inalienablerights of minorities. Does Mr. Biden wish Judge Thomas stillcounted as only three-fifths of an American?   Whatever the reason, Mr. Biden has now decided he doesn'tlike Judge Thomas's answer and chooses not to believe it.This is despite the fact that not one of Judge Thomas'sopinions for the federal appeals court in Washington mentionsnatural law. So expect more newfound high dudgeon about thedangers of judicial activism.   This criticism of what Judge Thomas does not believe wouldbe benign nonsense except for a danger that should worrypeople who are more serious than the Members of the JudiciaryCommittee. We have in mind Mr. Biden's attempt to ostracizeproponents of economic liberties.   He asked Judge Thomas whether he thought there was anatural right to property and contracts. John Locke and JohnStuart Mill would say yes, but there is no reason for a judgein this country to reach for natural-law philosophy toprotect these rights.   Mr. Biden unintentionally did the country a service bywaving around a copy of University of Chicago Law Prof.Richard Epstein's &quot;Takings&quot; (Harvard University Press, 1985).He asked incredulously if Judge Thomas believed in thiseconomic-liberty talk. &quot;There's a whole new school ofthought,&quot; Mr. Biden intoned, &quot;that up until about five yearsago only spoke to one another that is now receiving widercredence and credibility.&quot;   Well, the Founding Fathers memorialized economic rights inthe Constitution itself. The Fifth Amendment says thegovernment can take private property only for a &quot;publicpurpose&quot; and only if &quot;just compensation&quot; is paid. TheContracts Clause bars any &quot;law impairing the obligation ofcontracts.&quot; The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect dueprocess for life, liberty and property. Judge Thomas remindedMr. Biden, &quot;there is a Takings Clause in the Constitution andthere's also a reference to property in our Constitution.&quot;   These rights, which are explicit and require no invocationof natural rights or penumbras, have gone largely unprotectedsince FDR told the Justices he'd pack their court if theyinterfered with the New Deal. The failure to protect theproperty right to the product of one's work, incidentally,made Jim Crow possible. As Judge Thomas said, segregationlaws &quot;did not allow my grandfather to enjoy the fruits of hislabor.&quot;   By now, the failure to enforce the Takings Clause is anepidemic. Expropriation by rent control and abusive zoning iscommon. Environmental regulations in particular routinelyamount to takings. Wetlands rules turn valuable property intoland that can't be developed. Timber companies unlucky enoughto own trees that attract Spotted Owls have had theirbusiness outlawed. Congress can pass these regulations, butthe Takings Clause was supposed to require compensation. Thisis about more than fairness. The Founders also insisted onthe Takings Clause as a limit on the amount of governmentregulation by making sure taxpayers would bear the costs ofregulations that hurt property values.   Mr. Biden is right; there is a &quot;whole new school ofthought&quot; on the proper relationship between the state andprivate property. We know that Mr. Biden possesses a copy ofRichard Epstein's &quot;Takings.&quot; When he's done waving it, werecommend that he open it and read it.</TEXT></DOC>
