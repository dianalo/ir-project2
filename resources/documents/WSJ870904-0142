He put aside his artisan's work for the more practical labor of making plowshares from hydrogen cylinders and hatchets from wrecked train wheels.    Theo Stirnweis is also an iron craftsman, living in the West German town of Erlangen. He, too, recalls the hardship after the war when members of his family were so hungry they sold a hand-tooled iron chest, the best piece he ever made, to an American GI for food and cigarettes.    But today the unifying memories of war and sacrifice have given way to divergent ones of a Germany divided by profound political changes. In the immediate postwar period, the nation's eastern half became a communist ally of the Soviet Union, and the western side allied with the U.S. Though the West German constitution holds that the division of Germany is temporary, Messrs. Franke and Stirnweis, 61 and 59 years old respectively, have worked and lived in two countries that have grown apart in the four decades since their separation.    Recently the Soviets have permitted closer ties between the two German states. Trade between them has more than doubled in the past decade. More East Germans, of late even young people, have been allowed to visit relatives in the West. Cities have been officially &quot;twinned,&quot; as Erlangen and Jena, both university towns with populations of about 100,000, were this past spring.    The biggest breakthrough in inter-German relations will come on Monday, when East German leader Erich Honecker, who was born in territory now part of West Germany, begins a five-day trip to the &quot;other German state&quot;; he will be the first East German leader since the war to visit West Germany.    Yet, despite the links and common heritage, in the mentality of the people and the prospects they face, the gulf between the two German states has never been greater.    This widening gap is reflected in economic performance. Although East Germany is the strongest country economically in the Soviet bloc, the incomes of its citizens still trail those in West Germany by about 50%. The lure of greater prosperity, beamed into East German homes via West German television, has in part prompted some four million East Germans to emigrate to the West since the war.    In sights and sounds, too, East and West Germany appear wholly different. On the East German &quot;Autobahnen,&quot; where, unlike in West Germany, speeding is strictly prohibited, the Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs have West German license plates and are driven by &quot;haughty&quot; tourists, East Germans complain. The Easterners must contend with life in the slow lane: The ugly little three-cylinder Wartburgs and Trabants, which spew out foul-smelling exhaust, have poor suspension and can take a decade to get.    In East German fields, women still stoop to handpick crops. In the streets, only the red banners proclaiming Marxist verities -- &quot;Everyone in Their Workplace is the Best for our Social Peace&quot; -- break otherwise drab surroundings. In the stores, goods such as fresh vegetables are scarce and poor in quality. Sought-after items like color television sets can be staggeringly expensive. According to one East German, the only color set recently available in his region was going for the equivalent of the average yearly income in his country.    Many East Germans, beaten down by years of repression, are simply resigned. &quot;It's no use reaching for the stars if you can't catch them,&quot; says a Jena farmer.    Still, a surprising number of citizens in Jena say they find life under socialism quite livable, though they bitterly resent the travel restrictions. The tempo of life in East Germany is slower and, they believe, makes for better neighbors and friends.    A sense of the two Germanys' separate identities emerges by comparing people in parallel professions in the twin towns of Jena and Erlangen. Although there are certain similarities between Easterners and Westerners, their differences appear sharp enough that if the wall dividing the Germanys suddenly came falling down, the people of the two lands might not rush forward to reunite.    The Teachers   Heidruin Ertel, her blue eyes serious and staring straight ahead, views ideology as an essential ingredient for teaching her third-graders in Jena's working-class suburb of Neu Loboda. Seated in front of a bookshelf lined with the works of Lenin, a Russian-German dictionary and a biography of Erich Honecker, she explains: &quot;Every subject contributes to ideology in our schools.&quot; Indeed, lessons are laced with stories about workers and corrupt rich people, about war and peace, about communism and fascism. &quot;This is difficult with small children,&quot; she admits. &quot;We don't want to frighten them, but such things have to be told all the same.&quot;    Barbara Strambach, a 47-year-old teacher in Erlangen, dislikes political doctrine. &quot;I don't want to interfere with the parents' area of education,&quot; she says. Born and raised in East Germany before emigrating with her family to the West, she has unhappy memories of grade school in the East. Still, when she delves into politics, she tries not to let personal views show. In a recent third-grade class, she discussed democracy with her pupils.    Mrs. Strambach: What does democratic mean?    Pupil No. 1: It's the rules.    Mrs. S.: Yes, we have to keep the rules. What else?    Pupil No. 2: It's when one person has a say.    Mrs. S.: Is that democratic? You are in the right direction when you say that it has something to do with deciding.    Pupil No. 3: The Russians don't let East Germans have so much freedom. They have different rules than we have. We have more freedom.    Mrs. S.: Who lets us have more freedom?    Pupil No. 4: The Americans let us have more freedom. The Russians are more strict.    Mrs. S.: Now, we have to make things clear: What does democratic mean? There are rules here and rules in East Germany. We can't just do what we want. But democracy -- for you as a small student and also your moms -- means you have maneuvering room.    Pupil No. 5: Children can also say what they want to do. They don't always need to follow the rules. They, too, can say what they think.    In these two schools, the walls speak volumes. In Jena, drawings show the dangers of the arms race, with one penciled picture showing the letters SDI -- Strategic Defense Initiative -- hanging from the moon over the planet earth and another depicting the Soviet's Cosmos orbiting space station. Under the legend &quot;Soldiers of Peace,&quot; 12 woodcuts illustrate moments from the Russian revolution, with the kicker: &quot;Since then, the world has hope.&quot; On another wall, a drawing proclaims: &quot;Oppose NATO -- create peace.&quot;    In Erlangen, the classroom is decorated with children's self-portraits and pictures of flowers and animals. A wooden crucifix hangs on the wall, a tradition in southern Germany, which is predominantly Catholic.    The school in Erlangen offers religion classes weekly in two versions for Catholics and Protestants. But in East Germany, religion isn't taught and parochial schools are prohibited. &quot;Right across there is a small modern church,&quot; says the 38-year-old Mrs. Ertel, gesturing to the window. &quot;It's there if their parents wish to educate them in that spirit.&quot;    The Hairdressers   Adolf Hannberger's hairdressing salon in Erlangen has all the sights and sounds of its Eastern counterpart. In both shops, women in curlers leaf through German fashion magazines. The whir of blowdryers drowns out the din of small talk. Nails get painted and hair gets cut.    &quot;The things that exist here also exist over there,&quot; says Mr. Hannberger, 52 years old, who owns two shops in Erlangen and manages a third. &quot;We are one people.&quot;    But in Jena, Wolfgang Albrecht, 57, has a different view. He thinks the West is permissive and decadent. &quot;I would never go to West Germany. I see the morals over there,&quot; he says, shaking his head.    Mr. Albrecht, who has relatives in the U.S. and West Germany, does not belong to a political party. Still, he is sharply critical of the &quot;whole way of life&quot; in the West, where, he contends, people are judged according to an old German proverb: &quot;Hast du was, bist du was,&quot; or, roughly, &quot;You are what you own.&quot; West Germans are &quot;too materialistic,&quot; he adds. &quot;They all think more of themselves than of others.&quot;    What about his own material desires? &quot;I'm doing well. I own a house, a car, everything I need,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't need more. It's a human weakness that one who has much still wants more.&quot;    Mr. Albrecht's shop, which employs 52 people, is part of a &quot;Genossenschaft,&quot; a collective of 30 enterprises that pool their revenues and, out of a common pot, pay wages and other expenses. At the end of the year, the state gets its take, and what's left over is distributed among the workers. This year, each employee at his shop will receive a bonus payment of about 7% of his annual gross wages, or roughly 1,000 East German marks. (The official exchange rate between East German marks and West German marks is one to one, although one West German mark can fetch five or six East German marks on the black market; the equivalent of 1,000 West German marks is about $580.)    There are other differences between the two shops. A haircut with a wash costs about twice as much in Erlangen as it does in Jena. More modern equipment like swivel chairs with adjustable height isn't in evidence in the Jena shop. And in East Germany, even hair styles are reviewed by a state commission, which meets in East Berlin each year, to set fashion standards.    But on one point the two hairdressers agree fully: Life, they say, is more stressful in the West. &quot;Owning a shop today is a lot of stress,&quot; says Mr. Hannberger of Erlangen, a big man with a barrel chest who suffered a heart attack three years ago. &quot;I can't raise prices if there's a colleague next door. Or I must reduce my staff and make the few employees work harder,&quot; he says. &quot;There's a lot of competition.&quot;    The Doctors   That the typical West German's life is more comfortable than the typical East German's is perhaps best witnessed at company health clinics in Jena and Erlangen.    The clinic in Jena -- for employees of Carl Zeiss, the state-owned optical-products concern -- offers basic medical services, with no frills. &quot;From my readings I know that in Western countries, some diagnostic equipment is more generously available than may be the case here,&quot; says Christa Poerschmann, the 53-year-old director of the Carl Zeiss clinic.    The clinic in Erlangen -- for employees of Siemens AG, the private electronics concern -- offers all the riches of Western medicine. &quot;If I say I need a new machine, I get it at once,&quot; boasts clinic director Ilse Neiss, 63.    While Dr. Poerschmann concerns herself with mending broken bones and healing sickness, Dr. Neiss is removed from such mundane concerns. From her clinic, decorated with potted plants, she oversees the mental and physical well-being of Siemens employees. When warranted, she sends them to special relaxation and treatment centers, the famous German &quot;Kur,&quot; where people unwind, breathe fresh mountain air and exercise to improve their circulation. For those on company-sponsored diet programs, she checks the oil in their salads to make sure it isn't too fatty.    &quot;Siemens does a lot for its employees,&quot; she says. &quot;We really do have the best of conditions.&quot;    In East Germany, meanwhile, officials spend their time trying to shore up the slippage in basic health care. Back in 1970, East Germany had 5.4 fewer deaths than West Germany for every 1,000 births. Today, the infant mortality rate is 32% higher in the East.    The Lawyers   In his teens, when Heinz Heller was a soldier in Hitler's army, he spent 13 months imprisoned in a Soviet war camp. Today, the 61-year-old Jena resident is still a captive of the Soviet system. As one of the town's most respected attorneys, Mr. Heller often defends clients who are prosecuted by the state.    It is a difficult job, since the accused doesn't have many of the protections he would in the West. Jury trials, for instance, were abolished in East Germany in 1952 (a three-judge panel renders all verdicts).    Still, Mr. Heller defends the East German legal system as vigorously as he would a client. &quot;When they come to me, I fight,&quot; he says, his voice rising with passion. &quot;In my capacity as defense counsel, I have every opportunity to serve my clients.&quot;    As evidence, he submits the following: Three years ago, he appealed a life sentence for a young man who had been found guilty of murder. The Supreme Court reduced the sentence to 15 years.    Last year, Mr. Heller took up the case of two young men who were arrested as they crossed into Czechoslovakia because the East German border guard thought they intended to travel illegally to the West. &quot;After two months in prison, I obtained their acquittal. They received compensation,&quot; says the lawyer proudly. &quot;It wasn't easy to invalidate the evidence, but I succeeded.&quot;    Divorce cases, however, account for most of Mr. Heller's workload. That is also true of his counterpart in Erlangen, attorney Burkhard Eugen. Although the number of divorces is rising in both countries, the rate is 50% higher in East Germany and is one of the highest in the world. The reason: More is expected of East German women. Some 90% of them work -- the corresponding figure in West Germany is 49% -- and the pressures of balancing job and family have split many marriages.    While divorce may be more common in East Germany, facilitating it is an infinitely more lucrative profession in the West, judging from Mr. Eugen's office. The antique grandfather clock, upholstered chairs and framed etchings on the walls contrast starkly with Mr. Heller's sparse office, which is heated by a coal-burning stove.    Mr. Eugen, 40 years old, won't discuss his income. But a &quot;good attorney,&quot; he says, can earn as much as 1,000 marks an hour for some divorce cases. To which Mr. Heller responds, &quot;We are not interested in prolonging a trial to earn more.&quot; The state, he says, sets limits on the fees he charges.    As for the severe limitations the state imposes on personal freedoms, such as political prisoners who have been arrested trying to escape, Mr. Heller has little sympathy. &quot;We have learned that the citizen must avoid committing punishable offenses,&quot; he says. &quot;He who abides by our laws doesn't have a thing to fear.&quot;    The Ministers   The parish house of St. Martin Niemoller provides welcome relief from the faceless landscape of dull high-rise buildings in Jena's Neu Loboda suburb. Standing near gardens thick with flowers, Peter Albert Zimmermann, the Lutheran minister of Neu Loboda, notes the contrast. &quot;The apartments over there are all at right angles,&quot; he says with a smile. &quot;Here we have curves.&quot;    The parish house is an anomaly for more than its architecture. It was built in 1966 with assistance from the Lutheran Church of West Germany, which donated 60% of the church's construction cost.    For East German ministers like Mr. Zimmermann, creating the community center meant winning concessions from the authorities. Under Mr. Honecker, the state has allowed the church more independence than perhaps in any other Eastern European country. But the trade-off is that ministers must accept limits to their freedom.    &quot;I think that the state has a moral authority,&quot; Mr. Zimmermann says. &quot;But there are defects to it. Marxist ideology has great difficulties answering questions in connection with suffering and death. But the church has an answer if people ask.&quot;    Preaching God's word in an atheistic state is a delicate balancing act that requires both confrontation and compromise. Mr. Zimmermann, 45, speaks easily about the functioning of the church &quot;within socialism.&quot; Yet, in a private moment with Western visitors, he wonders aloud why the authorities would choose him for an interview subject. &quot;I am often outspoken,&quot; he says in a defensive tone.    Of the 50,000 who live in the &quot;satellite&quot; town, about 8,000 claim membership in the church. Of these, only 100 or so regularly attend services at the parish house's chapel. &quot;For me, it is a normal situation that Christians should be a minority,&quot; the minister says of the low attendance. More than half of his time, he estimates, is spent counseling people who don't belong to the church but who have &quot;loads to bear.&quot;    In Erlangen, 55-year-old Eberhard Berger presides over the Lutheran parish of St. Markus with a cheery, pragmatic spirit not unlike that of Mr. Zimmermann. But his battles are mostly bureaucratic, confined to budgets and church bazaars. &quot;Of course, not all of my parishioners are active Christians,&quot; he says. &quot;They don't go to church every Sunday, but they are happy the church helps them in difficult times.&quot; While Mr. Zimmermann must do battle with a state that still makes it hard for practicing Christians to hold high-profile jobs in government or the university, Mr. Berger even gets help from the government, which collects church taxes.    Mr. Zimmermann must count lesser blessings. It is an important breakthrough that he is allowed to hold services at a state-run old-age home nearby. He speaks with sudden passion about a visit to a dying man at that home: &quot;The man asked me: 'What will happen when I die?'&quot; he recalls. &quot;What would a Marxist's answer be? Shrug his shoulders, or what?&quot;    ---                    The Two Germanys                                WEST           EAST                                GERMANY        GERMANY Population (in millions)                  61.3           16.7 Area (in sq. miles)            95,975         41,768 Gross National Product 1980    1,265.5*       234.0* Working hours needed to buy Car                            607            3,807 Refrigerator                   40             293 Man's suit                     13             67 Housing facilities Central heating                70%            36% Indoor toilet                  95%            60% Bath/shower                    92%            68%   *In billions of West German and East German marks,respectively.
