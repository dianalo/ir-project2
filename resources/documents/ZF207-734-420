Faced at the time with four choices of Unix workstation suppliers,Xyvision did not pick the one seen as the hot box-Sun-even though virtuallyeveryone else doing ports did.andP;  Xyvision weighed othcr considerations, suchas the makeup of its typical customer and the applications it was serving.andM;Xyvision has been a big- system vendor from its inception.andP;  Its philosophyhas always been to interface a high-performance production system to acorporate network or a dedicated editorial system.andP;  Its strongest market hasbeen the aerospace industry.andP;  Bringing all of those factors to bear, it choseDigital because it offered both acceptable performance and a strong presencein corporate and aerospace markets.andP;  The weakness in choosing Digital twoyears ago was that DEC did not offer price-competitive, high-performanceworkstations.andP;  Today, the situation has changed dramatically with DEC'sintroduction of RISC computers based on the MIPS processor.andM;With the new announcement, Xyvision has become an OEM of Digital hardware.andO;Running on someone else's hardware will force thc company to undergo thegut-wrenching struggle of how to price and sell systems in which it getslittle if any return on thc hardware.andP;  (Some Xyvision aerospace customers buytheir DEC hardware cheaper than Xyvision does; for these customers, Xyvisionwill have to reap its return on investment solely from software and services,such as training and support.) This struggle is inevitable for any companythat makes the transition from the third wave to the fourth wave ofpublishing system technology.andP;  Porting the software, which Xyvision has done,is the critical first step for the engineers in the organization.andP;  Whatfollows is the upheaval in sales, marketing and customer support.andM;There are clear benefits to moving to off-the-shelf hardware for both enduser and vendor, as we've relterated innumerable times in this Report.andP;  ForXyvision's existing customers, Xyvision's new systems are not very differentfrom what they have now.andP;  But in thc long run, the move onto DEC will opendoors for Xyvision and its customers that would have stayed shut had eachremained bound to its present architecture.andM;Introducing ParlanceandM;Parlance is Xyvision's new umbrella term for &quot;a family of publishing systemswhich are designed to operate within a common architecture that is open andextensible.&quot; The architecture, which USES TCP/iP and NFS as its backbone,involves a variety of user applications (clients) connected to larger, sharedsystems, or servers over an Ethernet network.andP;  Its initial implementation isfor Digital DEC station 2100 and 3100 workstations, DECsystem file servers,the Xyvision Xyview III workstation and Xyvision 55/65 file servers.andM;Thus, Parlance will be a combination of DEC and Xyvision hardware all runningthe same Xyvision software, which is an upgrade from the current version (IPS2.1).andP;  To differentiate between Xyvision- and DEC- based systems, we winrefer to them as Parlance on Xyvision and Parlance on DEC where thatdistinction is relevant.andM;The basic software that runs on the DECstations is a port of Xyvision's IPS2.1 software from Xyvision hardware to DEC workstations running under Ultrix(DEC's version of Unix).andP;  The system was originally developed for theVaxstation, but when DEC introduced the RISC-based DECstation series earlierthis year, Xyvision opted to use the Ultrix-only machines to utilize theoptimum processing power thc DECstation offered.andM;The initial configurations are based on hardware Digital has alreadyannounced.andP;  Of course, one of the benefits of porting software tooff-the-shelf hardware is that Xyvision will be able to offer Parlance onfuture workstations that run Ultrix, as they become available.andM;DEC hardware.andP;  Two main configurations were introduced: a workstation andfile server, similar to Xyvision's own configuration.andM;The workstations may be DECstation 2100s or 3100s.andP;  These are based on thesame processor, but the 2100 has a slower clock speed and cheaper memory, andit costs about $4,000 less than a 3100.andM;The recommended hardware configuration will be a workstation with 16 MB ofRAM, a 104-MB disk, which is used for swapping the program and document inand out of memory, and a 3 1/2&quot; floppy drive.andM;Xyvision software runs within DECwindows in thc local workstation.andO;Monochrome or color displays, each of which features a resolution of 860 x1024 pixels, arc available.andP;  No special add-in boards are needed.andM;Multiple workstations are connected through Ultrix file servers using DECnet(Ethernet) protocols.andM;DECsystem 3100s, 5400s and 5800s are offered as file servers.andP;  These arebased on the same family of MIPS chips but with larger storage (300 MB willprobably bc the standard configuration) and without the graphics display.andO;DEC has not yet said how many workstations each of these file servers wouldtypically support, and Xyvision has still not finished its performanceevaluations, but it indicated that 3-4 and 12 workstations, respectively,might be more reasonable numbers for the 3100 and 5400 servers in a Parlancesystem.andP;  It should also bc noted that there are boot and program servers andfile servcrs (although one server may serve as both in a small system) .andP;  Theboot and program servers take thc brunt of die load and would benefit mostfrom a larger server.andP;  The file servers store the documents; the 3100s wouldprobably be adequate for many users.andM;The Xyvision 55 and 65 servers will be available initially as well.andP;  They maybe used as the sole file servers, as long as there is a DEC boot serversomewhere on thc network, or they may be used in conjunction with DECservers.andM;The Xyvision 85/95 servers will be available about six months later.andM;In addition to supporting NFS, Digital networking provides gateways toAppleTalk networks, which Xyvision will use to connect its structured editor(discussed below).andM;Xyvision hardware.andP;  To drive typesetters in any language other thanPostScript, a Xyvision file server is required, because DEC does not offer adirect interface to a typesetter.andP;  At the Computer Publishing Conference,Xyvision demonstrated the use of a Kodak- 1392 as thc output device throughDEC's print services.andP;  This was strictly a technology demonstration, however.andO;Xyvision expects its initial customers to bc driving Tegra or Autologictypesetters (and possibly Linotronics in Cora) and therefore will includethose interfaces in its Parlance , systems through Xyvision hardware.andO;Xyvision said it still needs more time to evaluate how fast the PostScriptdriver will work over the DEC network, but that driver will bc part of theinitial systcm, which means that a DEC-only systcm could still producetypeset output through PostScript.andM;The Xyvision file server is also required for processing high-resolutiongraphics, such as those from an ECRM Autokon.andM;The Xyview workstations can run off DEC file servers .In the demo wcreceived, the Xyview ran off a Vax running Ultrix.andM;Xyview III workstations may coexist with DECstations on a Parlance network.andO;The Xyview III offers a high-resolution display (1024 x 2048 pixels) and aXyvision keyboard.andP;  Otherwise, it is exactly the same as a DECstation infunctionality.andM;Parlance softwareandM;Thc underlying software is IPS 3.0, an extension of Xyvision's current IPS2.1 composition and pagination software.andP;  The primary reason for the softwareupgrade is to rectifty the difference in byte-order between the two systems(one is big Endian, the other little Endian).andP;  Because Xyvision exchangesfiles as binary data, it was critical to resolve this discrepancy if the userwas not to suffer a time penalty for retrieving documents on diffcrcntsystems.andP;  We edited a document on the DECstation, saved it and retrieved iton a Xyview just to make sure that this works.andM;Bitstream screen fonts.andP;  From a user's perspective, the most notable changein the new software release is a change in screen fonts from Xyvision fontsto Bitstream fonts This switch dramatically increases the choices of fontsavailable, from two to the entire Bitstream library.andM;The standard systcm will be bundled with two Bitstream families (Swiss andDutch-or Helvetica and Times Roman), just as current Xyvision systems offerone serif and one sans serif display face.andP;  As in the current system, thewidth table uscd is that of the output device, to ensure proper word spacingand line endings.andP;  If the output device uses Bitstream fonts, the displaywill be truly WYSIWYG (WYSIWYG to use Tom Hagan's phrase).andM;Xyvision converts Bitstream's outlines to its own outlines and bitmaps.andO;Customers will buy additional Bitstream display faces through Xyvision.andO;Pricing has not yet been determined.andM;The use of Bitstream faces is a godsend to Xyvision users doing advertisingor design work, because now they will be able to use the actual faces forlarge type.andP;  We found the on-thefly generation of large character bitmapsfrom outlines to be quite responsive, even on a Vaxstation.andM;Upgrading.andP;  Other extensions to 2.1 were relatively minor: support forpartitioned disks, and a minor change to the soft keys on the DECstation thatallows multiple editors to run at the same time.andP;  (The Xyview will onlysupport one editor at a time.)andM;Not highlighted in the product announcement but included in the new softwarerelease will be enhancements for the commercial market.andP;  The most noteworthyis the long-overdue support for hung punctuation, a feature that is alsobeing utilized in the Kanji system.andM;The one annoying aspect of the upgrade is that because of the change in filestructure, documcnts cannot be interchanged between new and old systems.andO;Existing style sheets and documents can be converted to 3.0, but onceconverted they cannot be reconverted back to the old format.andP;  Xyvision hasnot yet determined its pricing schedule for upgrading the software among itscustomer base, but given the limitations of staying with 2.1, we hope thecharge for upgrading will be minimal.andM;Programmming interface.andP;  Parlance is based on DECwindows, which is Digital'simplementation of X Window.andP;  Unlike Interleaf which still uses some of itswindowing manager software when running under Ultrix, Parlance relies onDECwindows for all screen and windowing functions.andP;  The intention, accordingto Xyvision, was to act as a well-behavcd DECwindows application.andM;User interface.andP;  The move to another windowing systcm has not significantlyaltered the user interface, however.andP;  In fact, the differences between thecurrent systcm and the DEC implementation are so minor that we wouldcharacterize it as the Xyvision interface running under DECwindows (just asthe Interleaf intcrface is Interleaf under DECwindows).andM;The primary difference is that all aspects of Parlance running on a DECworkstation run within self-contained windows, rather than taking over thescreen.andP;  Windows may be manipulated (sized and moved) to make it easier towork in multiple windows at the samc time.andM;There are three Xyvision application windows: XyShell, thc window for workingwith directories, style sheets and so forth; the page view; and the XyTextmonospaced editor running under Ultrix.andP;  Again, none of these look verydifferent from a Xyview, except that you can have any combination of them(even multiple WYSIWYG sessions) open at the same time.andM;As Xyvision has learned during the development of Parlance, the ability towork with multiple windows is an eyeopener for those accustomed to livingwithout it.andP;  In our demo, we found several occasions to make use of thefeature, and we expect that users will quickly find it indispensable.andP;  Infact, it may be hard for individual operators to choose between keeping theirhigh-resolution Xyview and the lower-rcsolution, but multiple-window,DECstations.andP;  Multiple windows will not be supported on thc Xyview, becauseit does not run under X Window.andM;Another difference, of course, is that a DECstation has a Digital keyboardand a Xyview has a Xyvision keyboard.andP;  Luckily, both keyboards have ah-nostthe same number of keys, and the rightmost keypad, which is used by Xyvisionin its soft-key display, is nearly identical on both systems.andP;  The mostsignificant difference is that DEC's cursor pad is half a diamond, -animprovement over the two-square block cursor pad on the Xyvision keyboard.andO;Xyvision will supply both a template and key labels for the DEC keyboards tosmooth the transition for current users.andM;Performance.andP;  Xyvision was reluctant to have us compare the performance of aXyview with a DECstation, supposedly because the company has not yet run itsown bcnchmark comparisons.andP;  Nevertheless, Xyvision has stated for so longthat it would take a performance hit when it ported that we thought it wouldbc useful to test that assumption.andM;What we found is that the performance hit may be less than Xyvisionanticipated.andP;  If it had had to use Vaxstations, there would be a cleardifference.andP;  In one sample 10-page job, the Xyview recomposed and paginatedin half the time of the Vaxstation, Much of the difference may have been dueto the screen display: without the overhead of DECwindows, the Xyview'sscreen display when recomposing is much faster.andP;  But even on a Vaxstation,there was no noticeable difference when simply turning pages of a document.andM;On a DECstation, the differences are even more slight.andP;  Because its fastestmachine was being prepared for the show, we were unable to run the same jobon a DECstation 3100, but given the raw speed of that machine, it is safe tosay that Xyvision's timing in making its port is fortuitous: by next year, itis likely that DEC will offer an Ultrix workstation that will out-perform aXyview.andM;Xyvision expects to continue offering the Xyview as long as DEC has nocomparable high-resolution display.andM;Working with imported dataandM;Xyvision has a motto: Input from anywhere; output to anything.andP;  While notliterally true, the motto summarizes an underlying premise of its systemphilosophy.andP;  Xyvision systems are the place where the components of adocument are brought together and prepared for presentation.andP;  In many cases,customers also use the Xyvision system to manage the documentation process.andM;This philosophy is enhanced with Parlance because DEC offers a variety ofintcrfaces, filters and gateways that broaden Xyvision's input interfaces.andO;Support for PostScript and all of the major typesetters remains unchanged, asdoes Xyvision's XyChange translation facility.andP;  But Xyvision has added a newgraphics input facility: a PostScript-clone interpreter through whichmonochrome images may bc imported directly into a Xyvision document.andM;CDA support.andP;  Xyvision has become the fourth vendor to announce a commitmentto support Digital's Compound Document Architecture (CDA).andP;  What this meansis developing filters from the composition system to DDIF, Digital's formatfor exchanging documents from one system to another.andM;We were pleased to see that Xyvision has leapfrogged the previously announcedCDA supporters (Datalogics, Interleaf and Aldus) by developing a full set ofconverters.andP;  To show its CDA support, Xyvision demonstrated how text, tablesand graphics might bc brought into its system through the use of DEC's CDAtoolkit.andM;The toolkit provides filters for converting documents into DDIF.andP;  Forexample, Xyvision imported text from WordPerfect, a table from Lotus and aPostScript graphic into a Xyvision document.andP;  The interesting part of thedemonstration, though, was to see how Xyvision was able to show aneditorial-like approach (a user cutting and pasting data from other sourcesinto thc Xyvision document), rather than its customary production-orientedmethod of running everything in the background through XyChange and scripts.andO;We're not sure how many customers will be interested in buying Xyvision foreditorial work, but the windowing capability of Parlance is already having aneffect on the company's approach to publication problems.andM;Graphics.andP;  One distinct difference between Parlance on DEC and acurrent-generation Xyvision is that Xyvision's 2D vector drawing package willnot be offered on the DEC platform.andP;  The implications arc clear: Xyvisiondoes not see itself as a graphics software developer and in itsnext-generation systems, its customers will make use of graphics programs oftheir own choosing.andP;  Whether those programs run on DEC hardware, Macintoshes,PCs or another platform is irrelevant to Xyvision.andP;  Parlance will be able toimport graphics from more places than before (by virtue of DEC's CDAtoolkit), and the Xyvision operator will assemble documcnts created on othersystems.andM;Of course, you will need a Xyview if you want to edit imported drawings.andP;  ButXyvision sees the need for this capability decreasing over time.andP;  just as inCALS, where the IGES file is passed through to the final tape untouched,Xyvision sees its role evolving into one of managing, assembling andcomposing, not graphics creation and editing.andM;Because the DECstation will not be offered with direct interfaces to inputdevices, in the initial offering of Parlance, graphics will be imported overthe network.andP;  Xyvision has de veloped a DDIF-to-Xyvision filter for vectorand raster graphics so any format that DEC supports (or third parties writeDDIF filtcrs for) will be supported.andM;As mentioned before, a direct connection to a high-res graphics scanner likean ECRM Autokon will be offered on the Xyview or Xyvision file servers.andO;PostScript input.andP;  Xyvision wiU use the same PostScript interpreter fromCustom Applications, Inc.andP;  (CAI) that Xyvision Design Systems is currentlyoffering with its Contex system.andP;  The CAI software Rip takes monochromePostScript files and rasterizes them at user-definable resolutions for theXyvision system.andP;  Thc RIP runs in the DEC or Xyvision file server, and it isimplemented as part of the DDIF-to-Xyvision raster conversion.andM;Bitstream fonts are used for all text, which ensures that the fonts for textand imported PostScript graphics will be identical, if the output devicesupports Bitstream fonts.andP;  Xyvision now has a reseller agreement with Tegraby which it can offer Tegra's typesetters directly to its customers.andP;  Tegrasupports Bitstream fonts in all of its typesetters.andM;The PostScript interpreter will be offered as an option to Parlance in thefirst half of 1990 for $12,500.andM;Communications.andP;  Under a DEC-based Parlance, remote communications will behandled by Digital's UUCP programs.andP;  Xyvision says the differences betweenthose Ultrix-based utilities and the ones it offers now are not significantfrom an end-user's standpoint.andP;  Remote terminals or communication over phonelines are still options, but most communication wiU be through Ethernetlocal-area and wide-area networks.andM;Xyvision 101 Edgewater Drive Wakefield, MA 01880 Phone (617) 245-4100andM;Oracle: foundation for database managerandM;Over the last six years, Xyvision has developed its own sophisticateddatabase management applications, which are notable for their support of apage-oriented database.andP;  The best examples are its magazine pagination andlooseleaf pagination options.andP;  Magazine pagination allows both for multiplestories to be flowed in separate layout areas on the same page and forstories to flow on multiple, nonsequential pages.andP;  The looseleaf packagecontains edits to a, single page, generates looseleaf pages automaticallywhen revisions cause text or graphics to ripple beyond thc current page, andtracks the changes to all of the pagcs in order to create and update a listof all of the pages and their status (the list of effective pages ingovernment and aerospace documentation).andP;  At this time, the only other vendordelivering both looseleaf and magazine pagination is Penta.andP;  Miles 33 hasannounced a magazine pagination program that is not yet complete.andM;As part of its move onto DEC hardware, Xyvision explored the use ofthird-party database management programs that might open up new possibilitiesfor document management.andP;  At one of its customers, Westland Helicopter in theUK, it found a document management application written on top of Oracle inVMS that it thought might be useful to other Xyvision aerospace customers.andO;Xyvision worked out an agreement with Westland whereby it was able to obtainthe rights to port the Wesdand application to Ultrix and offcr it as aproduct to other Xyvision customers.andP;  As this work developed, Xyvision formeda VAR agreement with Oracle so that it is able to resell thc Oracle databasemanager itselfandM;Aerospace application.andP;  The Westland application uses the SQL*Forms builderof Oracle to create a shell from which &quot;text modules&quot;(e.g., pages andchapters) are managed.andP;  The forms in the shell present various levels ofinformation from the Xyvision database.andP;  The information about Xyvisiondocuments is keyed into Oracle; there is no automatic updating of the Oracledatabase based on changes to Xyvision pages.andM;One of the interesting aspects of this application is that it offers Xyvisionthe mcans to create shells other than its current XyShell.andP;  (The shell is theinterface that the user interacts with to make use of the database.) Oracleoffers several shell-like products that operate above its kernel databasemanagement software.andP;  SQL*Forms, used by Westland, provides a mechanism forbuilding forms and then tools for querying, display and traversing within theform style created.andM;Another part of Oracle's shell-building solution is SQL*Plus, which takes amore conventional query approach but also allows scripts to be attached toqueries-a tool Xyvision finds interesting given its tendency to make heavyuse of scripts.andP;  Oracle also offers a &quot;C-language&quot; program for defining yourown application interface to the database kernel.andP;  Initially, Xyvision willoffcr software based on the Westland application to its aerospace customers.andO;But it sees in Oracle the possibility for a variety of document managementtools designed for specific vertical applications.andM;Xyvision may also use Oracle as a means of linking SGML information with aXyvision database.andP;  As we mentioned in our TechDoc coverage, we are concernedthat, in the long run, Xyvision may be hurt in the CALS market by itsinability to support SGML in its document databases.andP;  The company indicatedthat rather than try to completely overhaul its code to incorporate abuilt-in SGML parser, it would first explore the possibility of mapping SGMLattributes to Oracle markers, which would be retained through the conversionprocess.andM;How this and other applications of Oracle in Parlance may pan out isuncertain.andP;  What is clear is that Xyvision has nized a need for broaderdatabase management tools, and it has picked, in Oracle, the leadingrelational database company as a partner.andM;While this implementation is not as elegant as Intergraph's DP/Manager,software vendors like Xyvision are not in thc position of developingsystem-wide products.andP;  (IBM, Sun, DEC and HP/Apollo, are you listening?) Ifthe hardware vendor falls to develop a comprehensive database managementinterface that all of its application developers can make use of, thenpublishing vendors have no choice but to work out specific implementations ofthird-party software.andP;  We believe Xyvision is right in its approach; we justwish DEC would help make it possible for Xyvision to use a database interfacethat would be consistent with those of other vendors.andM;(Interleafs custom system group, which developed an Oracle-based product forGTE, faced a similar dilemma and chose a similar approach to meeting acustomer's need.)andM;Parlance availability and pricingandM;Xyvision plans to install Parlance at its beta sites later this year.andP;  Alimited number of first commercial shipments are planned for the firstquarter of 1990, with volume sales to follow in mid- to late-1990.andM;In general, Xyvision will offer the DEC hardware at fist and price itsParlance software the same as it does now.andP;  Roughly speaking, this means theentry point for a DEC-based system is not less expensive than a currcntXyvision systemabout $125,000 for a two-seat configuration.andM;A four-seat system with one DECstation 3100, three DECstation 2100s, aXyvision 55 Graphic Server, laser printer and typesetter driver would runabout $250,000.andP;  A four-seat configuration with the larger DECsystem 5400server, three DECstation 3100s, a Xyview III, the Xyvision 55 Graphic Server,laser printer and typesetter driver would be about $300,000.andM;SoftQuad for structured editingandM;As we mention in our look at XyVision's CALS package (see the article thatfollows in this issue), Xyvision needed an SGML editor to be competitive inthe cALS markct.andP;  The reason is that without one, Xyvision was unable tooffcr an editor for fixing errors found in thc parsing process.andP;  (SGML filesare parsed before being convertcd into Xyvision's format and then again whenbeing converted back to SGML when writing a CALS tape.)andM;Rather than develop its own SGML editor, Xyvision announced a developmentagreement with SoftQuad.andP;  Initially, Xyvision will offer SoftQuad'sAuthor/Editor for the Mac II under the Xyvision label.andP;  No functionaldifferences between Xyvision's and SoftQuad's standard product arc plannedfor this initial version, which should be available from Xyvision by the endof the year.andM;Pricing will differ slightly, however, as Xyvision will offer its structurededitor in packs of six or 24 copies, priced at $5,800 and $20,000,respectively.andP;  (Author/Editor is $995 in single-unit quantities fromSoftQuad.) Xyvision justifies the discrepancy by pointing to after-salesupport.andP;  The company is not in a position to offer its customary level ofsupport to single users; it will focus on selling the package to largeraerospace, corporate and commercial accounts.andP;  Xyvision customers could stillpurchase individual copies of the software from SoftQuad and do their ownintegration if they wanted to.andM;Because of its new relationship with SoftQuad, Xyvision is now a certifiedApple software developer.andP;  It will be offering Apple Macintoshes at anas-yet-unspecified discount off the retail price.andM;For those unfamiliar with Author/Editor, the program uses a built-in SGMLparser to enforce structured writing and editing.andP;  Based on the type ofdocument specified (in SGML terms, the DTD), Author/Editor forces the writerto structure a document in a manner that is consistent with the structurespecified in thc DTD, The program uses a context-sensitive cursor to show theuser at all times the valid tags (generic codes) that identify an element'splace in the logical structure of the document.andM;Author/Editor uses SGML as its native data format, which means that noconversion is neccssary when working with SGML files.andP;  In its CALS package,Xyvision uses its own SGML translation program to convert SGML files intoXyvision format, so no special features are needed to attach the structurededitor to the CALs package announced a month earlier at TechDoc (see articlein this issue).andM;The screen display of the document in Author/Edit arbitrary representation.andO;None of the formatting for the screen is saved in the file; formatting isdone by Parlance.andM;The structured editor may be configured with any Xyvision system.andP;  Incurrent-gcneration systems, a third-party Ethernet card, such as the oneoffered by Excelan, plugged into the Mac II enables the Mac to be physicallyconnected to the Ethernet network and lets files be transferred between theMac and the Xyvision system.andP;  Thc customer must havc TCP/IP on its Xyvisionsystem for this to work.andM;Under Parlance, thc connection will be stronger, because Digital networkingoffers an AppleTalk gateway.andP;  Using the GatorBox from Cayman Systems, the Macis an active participant on the Parlance network.andP;  The Mac user is able tosee and manipulate (create, copy, move, delete) files and folders on the Unixserver, assuming he has the proper permissions.andP;  Again, this interface isprovided through NFS.andM;Ultrix structured editor.andP;  In 1990, Xyvision will introduce a special versionof Author/Editor running under DECwindows and Ultrix.andP;  SoftQuad is doing theport to Ultrix, but Xyvision will have exclusive rights to sell the productfor the first six months.andP;  At this time, it is not clear how the DEC productwill differ functionally from the Mac one, if at all.andM;Kanji systemandM;In a development spurred by Marubeni Electronics, Xyvision's Japanesedistributor, Xyvision will soon be offering a Kanji version of its system.andO;Kanji is supported in entry, display and composition of Japanese and othcrforeign characters; die menus, error prompts, status window and othermessages in the user interface remain English.andM;Marubeni has already sold 15 European-language systems to 13 customers.andP;  Ithopes the new system will reach a broader customer base.andM;Two Bitstream fonts are supplied: Mincho and Gothic.andP;  The character set is alittle over 7,000 for each.andM;As with a standard Xyvision system, it is intended that text will come fromanother word processor.andP;  Xyvision supports four common Japanese methods ofencoding Kanji characters: Japan Industry Standard (iis); Shift-iis, thcmethod used by a majority of Japanese word processors and NEC personalcomputers; KEIS, a Hitachi format; and JEF, a Fujitsu format.andP;  With NEC,Fujitsu and Hitachi, Xyvision has covered the three leading computersuppliers in Japan and a majority of word processors.andM;But as with a standard Xyvision system, the user can still edit a documentafter it is composed.andP;  Xyvision supplies a tablet that contains smallrepresentations of 2,000 frequently used Kanji characters, about 150 Kanacharacters (roughly 75 each of Katakana and Hiragana) and a Roman alphabetand the Arabic digits.andP;  Selecting any of these characters with the stylusinserts the character in the file at the cursor location.andP;  In addition, 990spaces on the tablet are left blank for the customer to define.andM;In addition to the tablet, the keyboard is always active for keying inEnglish.andP;  Virtual keyboards provide a means to pick other characters from ascreen display of the keyboard.andP;  An unlimited number of virtual keyboards maybe defined by the user.andM;The system allows Japanese and other languages to appear in the samedocument.andP;  Two methods of hyphenating Roman languages are provided: our usualmethod of breaking words at valid hyphenation points and the Japanese methodof breaking words wherever the break occurs in normal word spacing.andP;  Japanesecharacters that cannot begin or end lines are honered.andM;Hypenation dictionaries and/or logic ate available for French, German,Italian, Spanish, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Finnish.andM;All text is composed from left to right.andP;  The practice of setting somedisplay text vertically is not yet supported.andM;The Xyvision Kanji system wiU be available only on the Xyview workstation,because of its superior resolution.andP;  noted that even seven-point type waslegible in the full-page display.andP;  The Chelgraph ideographic typesetter and aXyvision laser printer are used for output.andM;Delivery of the first system to the beta site is scheduled for October.andP;  Theprice of a typical system will be about 30 million yen.andM;FuturesandM;In its booth at the Computer Publishing Conference, Xyvision gave a stronghint of one development that is farther from completion: the marrying ofXyvision Design and Xyvision publishing technology.andP;  The demo featured screenshots of Xyvision's WYSIWYG editor running within the Contex color systcm tosuggest how &quot;design to print&quot; might be accomplished on a future system.andM;Such a marriage of the two systems is stiff a long way off-and how it willlook is something Xyvision is still exploring.andP;  But it is worth noting thatthe Silicon Graphics workstation in a Contex system uses the same MIPScompiler as the one used by a DECstation.andP;  This is sheer coincidence: when itchose DEC as its platform, Xyvision had no idea that DEC would introduce aMIPS-based machine.andP;  But the coincidence may prove invaluable.andP;  Once Parlanceis up and running next year on DEC, Xyvision will be in a much betterposition to see how the Xyvision Design color technology might fit intoParlance and how some of the Parlance capability might fit into a XyvisionDesign product.andM;ConclusionandM;Although the immediate impact of Parlance does not radically alter theposition of Xyvision's product in the market-the company remains a supplierof premium-priced publishing systems for &quot;mission-critical&quot; publishingapplications-the longterm benefits are substantial.andM;The port to DEC will result in profound changes for die company and itsfuture products.andP;  Running on off-the-shelf hardware will enable it to makeuse of new hardware DEC develops-and DEC is developing hardware at a muchquicker pace than Xyvision ever could.andP;  Running on DEC hardware opens up newpossibilities for integration with other systemssuch as the Oracle-baseddatabase application that was developed for its aerospace customers.andP;  Andcertainly, running on DEC hardware makes a Xyvision system much morepalatable to customers that are looking for a clear growth path for theirhardware; it removes the millstone label &quot;proprietary&quot; from the company'sneck and places it back in the mainstream of electronic publishing.andP;  With themove to the DEC platform, we hope that Xyvision will consider moving to a&quot;standard&quot; user interface.andM;The engineers' work is now nearly complete.andP;  But for the rest of the company,the real test is about to begin.andP;  In the next several years, Xyvision wiUundergo the same painfull transition that virtually every other dedicatedpublishing vendor is currently experiencing.andP;  Pricing, training, service andsupport: how are these key aspects of a successful installation-once bundledtogether in the overall system price-delivered in a manner that is bothcost-effective for customers and profitable for the vendor? Xyvision saysthat in the last few years the profits it received from hardware has steadilydeclined to the point where the shift to DEC hardware will not significantlyalter its financial outlook.andP;  What it says about its past may be true, but wedoubt the move into the future will be without struggle and surprises.andP;  Wecan only say now that what was done had to be done, and the company and itscustomers will be that much the better for it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
