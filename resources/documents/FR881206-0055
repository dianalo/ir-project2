Background </ITAG>The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-360) was enactedon July 1, 1988. This act, which provides for benefits not previously availableunder Medicare, protects beneficiaries against costs associated with acatastrophic illness. The Act provides for expanded Part A benefits effectiveJanuary 1, 1989 and expanded Part B benefits effective January 1, 1990.Many beneficiaries have private health insurance coverage that supplementsMedicare, usually through health benefits plans of current or past employers.Some of these health benefits plans offer protection against the costsof a catastrophic illness by limiting beneficiary out-of-pocket expensesor offering additional benefits, such as a longer period of hospitalizationthan Medicare covered; some plans may do both. In addition, some planspay deductibles, coinsurances, the Part A premium where applicable, thePart B premium, or some combination of these benefits.With the availability of expanded Medicare coverage beginning in 1989,beneficiaries that now are receiving additional benefits through theiremployers' health benefits plans would find that the coverages are duplicativeand they reap little, if any, benefit from the Medicare catastrophic coveragechanges. Therefore, Congress included section 421 in Pub. L. 100-360, whichensures that if an employer provided to employees or retired former employees,\1\<NOTE/> as of July 1, 1988 (the date of enactment of Pub. L. 100-360)benefits that will be available to Medicare beneficiaries as a result ofPub. L. 100-360, the employer must offer additional benefits, a refund,or a combination thereof, if the duplicative benefits have an actuarialvalue of at least 50 percent of the national average actuarial value ofthe benefits added or increased by Pub. L. 100-360. Congress enacted technicalamendments to section 421 in section 608(a) of The Family Support Act of1988 (Pub. L. 100-485 October 13, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T4>Note.</T4>_To avoid repetition, the term ``employee'', when used inthis notice, also includes retired former employees. More specifically, under section 421 the employer must (1) provide additionalbenefits to the employee or retired former employee that are at least equalin actuarial value to the duplicative benefits, (2) refund to the employeeor retired former employee an amount of money equal in actuarial valueto the duplicative benefits, or (3) provide a combination of additionalbenefits and refunds that total at least the actuarial value of the duplicativebenefits. In computing the actuarial value of the duplicative Part A, benefits(beginning January 1989) and duplicative Part B benefits (beginning January1990), employers have the option of using national average actuarial valuespublished by the Secretary or calculating the actuarial value based onguidelines published by the Secretary. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of This Notice </ITAG>This notice provides the actuarial values for the benefits added by Pub.L. 100-360; specifies the employers to whom the notice applies; defines``additional benefits;'' gives the applicable effective dates; definesduplicative benefits; contains the guidelines for employers to use to computethe actuarial value of duplicative benefits; and lists some of the benefitsadded by Pub. L. 100-360.A. National Average Actuarial Value of the Medicare Benefits Added or Increasedby Pub. L. 100-360The national average actuarial value of the Medicare Part A benefits addedor increased by Pub. L. 100-360 was $61 as of July 1, 1988. This is thecost of providing the increased Part A benefits for each beneficiary enrolled.Fifty percent of this amount is $30.50 per year. For 1989, the nationalaverage actuarial value is $65. The national average actuarial value ofthe Part B benefits added or increased by Pub. L. 100-360 will be publishedprior to January 1, 1990. B. Responsibility of EmployersEmployers are responsible for determining if, as of July 1, 1988, theyoffered to their employees or retired former employees who are coveredby Medicare any duplicative Part A benefits (as defined in D. below) and,if so, the actuarial value of any such benefits on July 1, 1988. If theactuarial value of their duplicative Part A benefits was, as of July 1,1988, 50 percent of the 1989 national average actuarial value of the Medicarebenefits added or increased under Pub. L. 100-360 (discounted to the valueas of July 1, 1988), the employer is required to offer additional benefitsor refunds, or a combination of additional benefits and refunds, equalin actuarial value to the value of the duplicative benefits determinedas if they were provided in 1989. If an employer provides only additional benefits, the benefits must beequal in value at least to the 1989 national average actuarial value ofthe duplicative Part A benefits that were provided by the employer to employeesas of July 1, 1988. Employers may provide a wide range of additional benefitsas long as they are equal in value to at least the actuarial value of theduplicative benefits. The additional benefits may consist of health carebenefits that do not duplicate the new Medicare benefits and may includepayment of the Part B premium, provided the employer was not already payingPart B premium as of July 1, 1988. If an employer was already paying thePart B premium as of July 1, 1988, that payment does not constitute anadditional benefit, even if the payments continue into 1990. If, before July 1, 1988, an employer had agreed to an increase in benefitsor services that were not covered under Medicare and that will become effectiveJuly 1, 1988 or later, we do not consider the benefits to be ``additional''benefits. Hence, the employer is required to provide additional benefits,refunds, or both, above and beyond any previously agreed-to benefit enhancements.We interpret the term ``actuarial value'' as referring to the value ofthe benefits to the employee rather than their cost to the employer. Acontrary interpretation could result in the additional benefits not directlybenefiting the employee which would be contradictory to the intent of thestatute. Thus, we do not consider administrative or other overhead coststhat an employer may incur in establishing the additional benefits or refundsappropriate for consideration by employers in determining the actuarialvalue of the new benefits or the amount of any refunds. If an employer decides to make only a refund of money, the refund mustbe available to the Medicare beneficiary no later than the end of the calendaryear in which the duplicative benefits were provided. The amount refundedto each individual should be determined by dividing the actuarial valueof the duplicative benefits by the total number of employees and retiredformer employees enrolled in the plan. Thus, each employee and retiredemployee will receive an equal refund. If an employer opts to provide a cash refund, and the employees or retireescontribute, through premiums, to the cost of the health plan, the employermay make all or part of the refund in the form of an offset against currentemployee premiums or a planned premium rate increase for 1989 or 1990,provided that the employer had notified the employees of the planned premiumincrease before July 1, 1988. An employer may not increase the cost ofplan benefits to employees or retired former employees or reduce the amountof plan benefits to offset the cost of additional benefits and/or refundsrequired by the maintenance of effort requirement in section 421 of Pub.L. 100-360.If an employer chooses to provide a package of additional benefits or acombination of additional benefits and refunds, the employer is requiredto take into account the timing of the change in its calculation of additionalbenefits and refunds. We believe it was the intent of Congress for employeesto have at least a full year's benefit under the ``maintenance of effort''requirement in section 421 of Pub. L. 100-360. For example, if an employerestablishes its additional benefit package for duplicative Part A benefitson July 1, 1989, the employees under such a plan would be deprived of additionalbenefits for the first six months of 1989. Using this example, the employerwould be required to either provide appropriate refunds to its employeesthat would cover the period of time during which additional benefits werenot provided; i.e., from January 1 to June 30, 1989, or ensure that theadditional benefits beginning July 1 equal in value one year's duplicativebenefits. C. Employers Covered by this Notice For purpose of this provision, ``employer'' means, in addition to individualsand organizations engaged in a trade or business, other entities exemptfrom income tax, such a religious, charitable and educational institutions,the governments of the individual States, the Territories, Puerto Rico,the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the District of Columbia, and the agencies,instrumentalities and political subdivision of these governments. Any employer that provides, as of July 1, 1988, health benefits to a Medicarecovered employee or retired former employee that are duplicative Part Abenefits or duplicative Part B benefits is subject to this provision withthe following exceptions: 1. The Federal Government as an employer; 2. Employers contributing to a multi-employer plan that is maintained underone or more collective bargaining agreements. D. Duplicative Benefits <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Part A </ITAG>Duplicative Part A benefits are benefits provided by an employer as ofJuly 1, 1988 to a Medicare-covered employee (including health coveragefor the Medicare-covered dependents of employees and retired former employees)that supplemented the benefits under Part A of Medicare before January1, 1989, but that, as of January 1, 1989, are covered under Part A of Medicareas amended by Pub. L. 100-360. The following are examples of duplicativePart A benefits: andbullet; Payment of the Medicare inpatient hospital deductible for anybut the first spell of illness in a calendar year. andbullet; Payment of a coinsurance amount for the 61st through 150th daysof hospitalization. andbullet; Payment for hospitization in excess of 150 days during a spellof illness. andbullet; Payment for more than 100 days of SNF services but for not morethan 150 days. In determining the value of this duplicative benefit, thevalue of any co-payments paid by the employer for the first eight daysshould be offset against the value of copayments from the 21st day throughthe 100th day in a benefit period and the value of the payment for anydays covered from days 101 through 150. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Part B </ITAG>Duplicative Part B benefits are benefits (excluding benefits with respectto covered outpatient drugs as defined in section 1861(<T2>t</T2>) (2), (3) and (4), as added by section 202(a) of the MedicareCatastrophic Coverage Act) provided by an employer as of July 1, 1988 toa Medicare-covered employee (including health coverage for the Medicare-covereddependents of employees and retired former employees) that supplementedthe benefits under Part B of Medicare before January 1, 1990, but that,as of January 1, 1990, are covered under Part B of Medicare as amendedby Pub. L. 100-360. The following are examples of duplicative Part B benefits:andbullet; Payment for mammograms as part of routine breast cancer examinations.andbullet; Payment for home intravenous drug therapy and associated itemsand service. andbullet; Payment of copayments for covered items and services after anemployee has made out-of-pocket part B payments of at least $1,370 in 1990.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Applicability When Medicare is Secondary Payer </ITAG>Employers are not required to provide additional benefits or refunds inthe case of any individual for whom Medicare is secondary payer under section1862(b) (2), (3) and (4) of the Social Security Act. These provisions ofthe statute require that employer plans be primary payers and that Medicarebe secondary payer for employed individuals and spouses age 65 and overif the employer has 20 or more employees, for disabled individuals underage 65 who are enrolled in large group health plans (i.e., plans that coverat least 100 individuals under age 65), and during the first year of anindividual's entitlement to Medicare on the basis of end-stage renal disease.When Medicare is secondary, the private insurer pays its benefits beforeMedicare. If the primary insurer does not pay all of the charges, Medicaremay pay secondary benefits to supplement the primary payment. The purpose of the Medicare secondary payment provisions is to conserveMedicare funds by shifting responsibility for the health care expensesof certain individuals to private insurance plans. If an employer thatis required under section 1862(b) to be primary payer were required toprovide additional benefits or refunds instead of duplicative benefits,Medicare would become primary payer for the benefits added by Pub. L. 100-360.This result would contradict the cost saving objectives of section 1862(b)(2), (3), and (4). Section 421 of Pub. L. 100-360 does not change section1862(b) of the Act or otherwise override it. See H.R. Rep. 998, 100th Cong.,2nd Sess. 197 (1988).E. Benefits Added or Increased by Pub. L. 100-360Some of the benefits added by or increased by Pub. L. 100-360 are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Part A</ITAG>andbullet; Unlimited free hospitalization after payment of a single annualdeductible of $560 (see 53 FR 38357). After the deductible is met, Medicarewill pay 100 percent of all covered hospital services, regardless of thecosts, length of stay, or number of times a beneficiary is admitted tothe hospital in any one year. This benefit also eliminates all previouscopayment requirements. (The previous benefit was 90 days of hospitalizationper spell of illness, with 60 ``lifetime reserve days,'' a required copaymentfor the lifetime reserve days and days 61 through 90, and a deductiblefor each spell of illness.)andbullet; One hundred fifty days of skilled nursing facility (SNF) careper year (instead of 100 days per benefit period subject to a coinsurancefor each of the first 20 days) and without requiring the beneficiary tobe hospitalized three days' immediately before entering the SNF. (UnderPub. L. 100-360, when a beneficiary is admitted to an SNF, he or she willbe responsible for copayments for the first eight days of care each year.Medicare will pay all other allowable expenses for up to 150 days of careeven if the beneficiary is discharged and readmitted to an SNF more thanonce during a year.)andbullet; Hospice care beyond the previous limit of 210 days when a beneficiaryis recertified as terminally ill.andbullet; Decrease in the number of units of blood to be replaced or paidfor: The beneficiary will be responsbile for the first three units of wholeblood or packed cells furnished each calendar year instead of each benefitperiod. The Part A deductible will also be reduced to the extent that thePart B blood deductible has been met.andbullet; Recalculation of the Part A monthly premium (for those beneficiarieswho buy into Part A of Medicare) as required by section 103 of Pub. L.100-360. It will equal the estimated actuarial value of the Part A benefitand for 1989 will be $156 a month. (It has been $234 a month in 1988.)andbullet; Effective January 1, 1990, home health care for up to six daysa week on an intermittent basis for as long as it is prescribed by a doctor.Beneficiaries requiring home health care seven days a week will be entitledto 38 days of care. The 38-day limit can be extended for a period of timeif a doctor certifies that the care is medically necessary.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Part B</ITAG>andbullet; Limitation of a beneficiary's out-of-pocket expenses for servicesand supplies to $1,370 in 1990. (Under the old law there was no limit toa beneficiary's out-of-pocket expenses.) Once that amount is reached, Medicarewill pay 100 percent of all allowable charges for the remainder of theyear. To reach the out-of-pocket limit, a beneficiary will be requiredto pay the first $75 (deductible) for covered benefits and 20 percent (copayment)of all additional covered costs up to $1,370. If a physician or supplierwho does not accept assignment charges more than Medicare's approved charge,the amount above the approved charge must be paid by the beneficiary andis not counted toward the $1,370 limit in 1990.andbullet; A mammogram benefit that provides Medicare coverage for a breastcancer examination every other year for women aged 65 and older, and atvarious intervals for younger female beneficiaries.andbullet; A respite care benefit that pays for the temporary services ofa home health aide to provide relief for a spouse, relative or friend caringfor a Medicare beneficiary who cannot be left alone. Medicare will payfor up to 80 hours per year of home health aide and personal care services.andbullet; Coverage for home intravenous drugs and associated items and services(including supplies, equipment, and nursing and pharmacy services).andbullet; Effective January 1, 1990, home health care for up to six daysa week on an intermittent basis for as long as it is prescribed by a doctor.Beneficiaries requiring home health care seven days a week will be entitledto 38 days of care. The 38-day limit can be extended for a period of timeif a doctor certifies that the care is medically necessary. This benefitis a Part B benefit only if the beneficiary is not enrolled in Part A.andbullet; The Part B deductible will be reduced to the extent that the PartA blood deductible has been met.D. Determining the Actuarial Value of Duplicative BenefitsUnder section 421 of Pub. L. 100-360, the employer has two options forcomputing the amount of additional benefits or refunds to account for duplicativePart A or Part B benefits: (1) It may determine that their value is equalto the national average actuarial value of the duplicative Part A or PartB benefits, respectively, as determined by the Secretary, or (2) it maydetermine their actuarial value based on the guidelines below.Regardless of the method the employer uses, the employer must determinethe value of the duplicative Part A or Part B benefits net of any premiumspaid by the employees or retired former employees. This means that theemployer first determines the value of the duplicative benefits on a percapita basis for the year in question (1989 for duplicative Part A benefitsand 1990 for duplicative Part B benefits). The employer then subtractsfrom the per capita value of the duplicative benefits any premiums theemployee pays toward the duplicative benefits. When the employer and employeeboth contribute toward the cost of the total employer health benefits package,the employee is considered to be contributing the same proportion of thepremium attributable to the duplicative portion of the benefit packageas the employee contributes toward the overall health benefits package.For example, if the per capita cost of an employer's entire health benefitplan is $200 per year, of which the employee contributes $50 (25 percent),and the cost of the duplicative portion of the benefit plan is $60, theemployee is considered to be contributing $15 toward the cost of the duplicativebenefits (25 percent of $60).If an employer provides duplicative benefits under more than one plan,it must determine the value of duplicative benefits for <T3>each </T3>benefit plan it offers individually and provide additionalbenefits, refunds, or both, to its employees accordingly.For example, if an employer determines that one of its benefit plans, asof July 1, 1988, provides duplicative benefits that have an actuarial valueequal to only 40 percent of the actuarial value of the benefits added orincreased by Pub. L. 100-360, it need not provide additional benefits,refunds, or both, to its employees enrolled in that particular plan. However,if another of the employer's plans provides duplicative benefits that havean actuarial value equal to 50 percent or more of the actuarial value ofthe benefits added or increased by Pub. L. 100-360, the employer will berequired to provide the employees enrolled in that plan with additionalbenefits, refunds, or both, that total at least the actuarial value ofthe duplicative benefits provided by that plan. The employer may not sumthe values and determine an average.If a collective bargaining agreement provides that certain company-paidhealth benefits are vested upon retirement of the employee, the employeris not required to provide additional benefits beyond the time periodsstated above, i.e. until the later of 12/31/89 or the date of the expirationof the agreement for duplicative Part A benefits and until the later of12/31/90 or the date of the expiration of the agreement for duplicativePart B benefits.G. Applicability to HMOs/CMPsSection 1876(g) of the Act provides that the Medicare program may contractwith health maintenance organizations and competitive medical plans (HMOs)on a risk basis. Payments made to HMOs on behalf of Medicare beneficiariesenrolled in HMOs are fixed and not adjusted based on the enrollees' actualuse of services. An HMO contracting on a risk basis is required to submitto the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) for approval, beforeeach contract period, its adjusted community rate (ACR). The ACR is theHMO's cost of furnishing Medicare covered services to Medicare enrollees.If the ACR is less than the average payment that HCFA Pays to the HMO,then the HMO is required, under section 1876(g)(2) of the Act, to: (1)Provide additional benefits not covered under Medicare; (2) reduce premiumsor other charges; (3) return the difference to HCFA, or a combination ofthe above three actions. Therefore, a Medicare beneficiary enrolled ina risk contracting HMO may be receiving benefits beyond the scope of Medicare,which are funded from HCFA's payment to the HMO.An employer may contract with an HMO that has a risk contract with HCFAto provide health benefits under the employer's group health plan. An employerthat has a contract with a risk HMO has the same responsibility under themaintenance of effort requirements as any other employer to determine if,as of July 1, 1988, the benefits the employer was providing through theHMO to its employees or retired former employees, constitute duplicativebenefits. Duplicative benefits could result in a windfall to the HMO. Ifthe actuarial value of any duplicative benefits being provided by a riskHMO with which the employer has a contract is at least 50 percent of thenational average actuarial value of the new or improved benefits providedunder Pub. L. 100-360, the employer is expected to negotiate with the HMOfor the provision of additional benefits and/or refunds equal in actuarialvalue to the value of the duplicative benefits. These additional benefitsunder maintenance of effort must be in addition to the additional benefitsthat the HMO already provides based on the difference between its averagepayment rate and its ACR.H. GuidelinesTo determine whether the provisions of section 421 of Pub. L. 100-360 applyto an employer plan, the employer must first determine the cost of theduplicative Part A benefits in 1988. This cost should then be comparedto the national average actuarial value of the duplicative Part A benefitsvalued as of July 1, 1988. The national average actuarial value of duplicativePart A benefits as of July 1, 1988 is $61. If the employer plan cost for1988 is at least $30.50, then the employer plan is subject to the provisionsof section 421.In calculating the cost to the employer plan, the employer must add togetherthe cost of all of the duplicative benefits in its plan. The sum of theemployer's cost is then compared to the national average actuarial valueof duplicative Part A benefit as of July 1, 1988; i.e., $61. If the employerdoes not know the cost of the duplicative benefits in 1988, but knows thecosts in some prior year, the employer may use the factors in Table 1 toarrive at the costs in 1988.The factors in Table 1 and Table 2 are based on the increases in Medicarereimbursement per person enrolled in Part A of Medicare. The factors forskilled nursing care might seem unusual at first glance because the factorfor adjusting costs from 1986 to 1988 is larger than the factor for adjustingfrom 1985 to 1988. This is due to the fact that these factors reflect theincrease in Medicare reimbursement per person, not total cost per person.Due to a large increase in the skilled nursing care coinsurance rate in1986, the actual Medicare reimbursement per person was less in 1986 thanin 1985. All of the factors in Table 1 and Table 2 are provided as guidelines.An employer does not have to use these tables. If an employer can determinethe costs of its plan by other means which conform to generally acceptedactuarial practices, the employer can do so.The following example will illustrate how to use Table 1 to determine whether,as of July 1, 1988, an employer meets the requirements of section 421:The employer knows the costs for duplicative Part A benefits in the planfor calendar year 1986 are:Duplicative inpatient hospital benefits cost $40 per person;Duplicative skilled nursing care benefits cost $5 per person; andThere are no other duplicative benefits. Using Table 1, the employer maynow determine the 1988 value of these costs as follows:1. The factor from Table 1 to adjust inpatient hospital costs from 1986to 1988 is 1.052. The employer would then calculate $40andmultiply;1.052to ge $42.08, the 1988 value of the duplicative inpatient hospital benefits.2. The adjustment factor from Table 1 to adjust skilled nursing care costsfrom 1986 to 1988 is 1.114. The employer would then calculate $5andmultiply;1.114to get $5.57, the 1988 value of the duplicative skilled nursing care costs.3. The employer then sums the costs of the individual parts. In this exampleit would be $42.08+$5.57=$47.65.4. The total of $47.65 is now divided by the national average duplicativePart A benefits valued in 1988 ($61) to get 79% ($47.65/$61).5. Since this percentage is greater than 50%, the employer is subject tothe provisions of section 421.6. In lieu of steps 4 and 5 the employer could compare the dollar valueof the duplicative benefits $47.65 with $30.50.If an employer is subject to the provisions of section 421, then the employermust determine the value of the Part A duplicative benefits for 1989. Theemployer then has the option of using this 1989 value or the national averageactuarial value of duplicative Part A benefits for 1989 ($65) in determiningthe amount of refund, or additional benefits, or combination of refundand additional benefits. The employer may use Table 2 to adjust the employerplan costs to 1989. Using the same example as above, the following willillustrate how the 1989 value of the Part A duplicative benefits may bedetermined:1. The adjustment factor from Table 2 to adjust the inpatient hospitalduplicative benefits from 1986 to 1989 is 1.117. The employer would thencalculate $40andmultiply;1.117=$44.68 to get the 1989 value of the duplicativeinpatient hospital costs.2. The adjustment factor from Table 2 to adjust the skilled nursing careduplicative benefits from 1986 to 1989 is 1.188. The employer would thencalculate $5andmultiply;1.88=$5.94 to get the 1989 value of the duplicativeskilled nursing care costs.3. The employer then sums the individual parts to get $50.62 ($44.68+$5.94).4. The employer then has the option of using the computed value ($50.62)or the 1989 national average actuarial value ($65) of the duplicative PartA benefit.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,b2,i1,s10,4,4,4,4,4</C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>To Determine the Value of Duplicative Benefits in 1988</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Factors to adjust given year to 1988]</ITAG><H1>Type of benefit</H1><H1>1984</H1><H1>1985</H1><H1>1986</H1><H1>1987</H1><H1>1988</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Inpatient hospital<D>1.125</D><D>1.076</D><D>1.052</D><D>1.034</D><D>1.000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Skilled nursing<D>1.095</D><D>1.069</D><D>1.114</D><D>1.073</D><D>1.000</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,b2,i1,s10,4,4,4,4,4</C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>To Determine the Value of Duplicative Benefits in 1989</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Factors to adjust given year to 1989]</ITAG><H1>Type of benefit</H1><H1>1984</H1><H1>1985</H1><H1>1986</H1><H1>1987</H1><H1>1988</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Inpatient hospital<D>1.194</D><D>1.142</D><D>1.117</D><D>1.098</D><D>1.062</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Skilled nursing<D>1.168</D><D>1.140</D><D>1.188</D><D>1.145</D><D>1.067</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">III.

Effective for Period for Provision of Additional Benefits, Refundsor Both</ITAG>Employers are required to provide to their employees and retired formeremployees additional benefits, refunds, or both, at least equal to theactuarial value of: (1) Duplicative Part A benefits (determined as if theywere provided in 1989) by January 1, 1989 but no later than December 31,1989, and (2) duplicative Part B benefits (determined as if they were providedin 1990) by January 1, 1990 but no later than December 31, 1990. However,where there is a collective bargaining agreement in effect as of July 1,1988, the employer requirement to provide additional benefits, refunds,or both, stays in effect until the later of December 31, 1989 for PartA benefits and December 31, 1990 for Part B benefits, or the date of theexpiration of the agreement, determined without regard to any extensionof the agreement agreed to after July 1, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact Statement and Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any rule that meets one of the E.O. criteriafor a ``major rule''; that is, that will be likely to result in_andbullet; An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumer, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; orandbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis thatis consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through612) unless the Secretary certifies that a rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposesof the RFA, certain employers are considered small entities.This notice does not contain rules. Rather it announces certain actuarialvalues and guidelines under section 421 on Pub. L. 100-360, which specifiesthat if, as of July 1, 1988, an employer provided employees or retiredformer employees benefits that were added or increased by Pub. L. 100-360,the employer must offer additional benefits, a refund, or a combinationthereof, if the duplicative benefits have an actuarial value of at least50 percent of the benefits added by Pub. L. 100-360. We are neverthelessevaluating the effects of the statute under the criteria of E.O. 12291and the RFA.As of July 1, 1988, those beneficiaries who are receiving duplicative benefitsfrom an employer health benefit plan that have an actuarial value of atleast 50 percent of the benefits added by Pub. L. 100-360 will benefitfrom this notice. Specifically, they will be eligible to receive additionalbenefits or refunds or a combination thereof. Those receiving duplicativebenefits valued at less than 50 percent of the actuarial value of benefitsadded by the provisions of Pub. L. 100-360 will not be eligible for anyrefunds or additional benefits or combination thereof.The provisions of section 421 of Pub. L. 100-360 may nominally increasethe administrative burden on those employers who are required by that sectionto determine their obligations to provide additional benefits or refundsequal to the value of duplicative Part A benefits they provided as of July1, 1988. However, we do not estimate that these administrative costs willresult in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. Therefore, we have determined that this notice is not a majorrule under E.O. 12291, and an initial regulatory impact analysis is notrequired. Also, the Secretary certifies that this notice will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.B. Rural Hospital Impact StatementSection 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatoryimpact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operationsof a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis mustconform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital withfewer than 50 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area.Although this document does not contain rules, we have evaluated the effectof section 421 of Pub. L. 100-360 under the criteria of section 1102(b)of the Act. We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we havedetermined, and the Secretary certifies that section 421 will not havea significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial numberof small rural hospitals.<ITAG tagnum="20">(</ITAG><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 1395b note (Section 421 of Pub.
