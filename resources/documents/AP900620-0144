But in Jerusalem, an aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamirpraised the decision, saying it ``removed a major obstacle'' topeace.   Jamil Hilal, director of the PLO's information department, saidthe U.S. move would encourage Israel's new hard-line government to``escalate its repression against the Arab population underoccupation.''   In Tunis, Salah Khalaf, regarded as the PLO's second-in-command,was quoted by the French news agency AFP as saying Bush's movewould ``freeze peace efforts and reinforce extremist forces'' inthe Middle East.   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar saidhe ``hopes that ways will soon be found of resuming a dialogue thatcan serve the great purpose of achieving peace in the Middle East.''   Hilal said in a telephone interview from Tunis that thesuspension of the dialogue ``can be judged only as an unfriendlyand colonial move. ... It's a blow to the peace process and aprovocation to Arabs states.''   Hilal said he expects the Palestine Liberation Organization, inretaliation for the suspension of talks, to call on Arab nations``to apply economic sanctions against the United States. I expectthe uprising in the occupied territories to escalate.''   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's chief advisor, Bassam Abu Sharif,said in another phone interview from Tunis that ``the PLOleadership has received the news transmitted through the media. Theleadership is studying carefully the text of his (Bush's)statement.''   He refused further comment.   Avi Pazner, a top aide to Shamir, praised Bush's decision to endthe dialogue.   It's ``an important and positive decision as far as the peaceprocess in the area is concerned,'' he said. ``The PLO was a majorobstacle to peace and now that obstacle is removed.''   In the occupied West Bank, Jamil Tarifi, a pro-PLO Palestinianleader who has been named as a possible peace negotiator, condemnedthe U.S. move.   ``We are very sorry for this position because the U.S. as asuperpower put itself under the pressure of the rightist Israeligovernment instead of pressuring the Israelis to move forward forpeace,'' Tarifi said.   ``Anyone who wants to talk to the Palestinians must talk withthe PLO,'' he added.   Bush suspended the 18-month-old dialogue Wednesday, saying thePLO had failed to forcefully condemn an unsuccessful May 30terrorist attack against Israel.   Bush had urged Arafat to disavow the assault and to disciplinethe PLO faction that sent two speedboats filled with fighterstoward a Tel Aviv beach.   Khalaf said the United States ``knows we have given all we canin this affair.'' He added that the United States and the PLO donot share the same ``interpretation of terrorism,'' AgenceFrance-Presse reported.   The boats were intercepted by Israel and four guerrillas killedand 12 captured.   The dialogue began after Arafat renounced terrorism and acceptedIsrael's right to exist.   In Stockholm, Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson said he``regretted'' Bush's decision.   Andersson was instrumental in persuading the PLO to renounceterror and start its dialogue with the United States.   Andersson said he was in contact with Secretary of State JamesA. Baker III earlier Wednesday and that Baker had urged Sweden to``continue its efforts to bridge the differences between theparties'' in the Middle East conflict.</TEXT></DOC>
