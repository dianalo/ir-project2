Further, this Act unifiestwo previous public laws: The Justice Assistance Act of 1984 and the Anti-DrugAbuse Act of 1986. This Act gives <T3>special emphasis </T3>to assisting states implementing drug controlstrategies, with secondary emphasis on assistance to improve the criminaljustice system's overall response to violent crime and serious offenders.Section 511 of the Act sets aside 20 percent or $50,000,000, whicheveris less, of the total amount appropriated for the Program in a specialdiscretionary fund for use by the Director of BJA in carrying out the purposesestablished in section 501(b) of the Act. Those purposes are:andbullet; Undertaking educational and training programs for criminal justicepersonnel;andbullet; Providing technical assistance to States and local units of government;andbullet; Undertaking projects which are national or multi-jurisdictionalin scope, which meet the needs of communities and which address the purposesspecified in the Act; and,andbullet; Providing financial assistance for demonstration programs likelyto be a success in more than one jurisdiction (section 510 of the Act).The Bureau of Justice Assistance solicited recommendations from more thana thousand Federal, state, and local law enforcement, prosecution, judicial,corrections, and treatment practitioners to assist in the development ofpriorities for this Program. The Bureau of Justice Assistance will respondunder separate cover to each respondent. Working groups of practitionersand national experts were established to review recommendations received,indentify effective programs responsive to those recommendations and proposefunding priorities in each of the program areas.The strategy for the Drug Control and System Improvement discretionaryGrant Program is to provide balanced and comprehensive support for state/localinitiatives against serious crime problems, especially those problems relatingto drug abuse and control, and to improve the functioning of the criminaljustice system at the state and local level. The strategy considers:andbullet; Enhancing the capacity of the States to define drug problems andfocus program development in areas of greatest need;andbullet; Continuing programs which are demonstrating success in bringingnew concepts and techniques to the criminal justice system;andbullet; Initiating new efforts to meet emerging issues or focus on problemsnot addressed in previous year programs;andbullet; Disseminating programs of proven effectiveness through evaluationand other documents, technical assistance and training;andbullet; Providing a support delivery system to assist implementation ofeffective programs;andbullet; Geographic distribution of programs to meet regional and stateneeds; and,andbullet; Special attention to the needs of inner-city communities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Application and Award Process</ITAG>The FY 1989 appropriation for Part E discretionary programs is approximately$30,000,000. A portion of these funds were earmarked by Congress for specificprograms. This program announcement contains application/proposal requestsfor a major portion of the available appropriation. The Bureau of JusticeAssistance makes every effort to establish an open and competitive applicationprocess. Applicaitons or concept papers are being requested. A panel ofexperts will be established in each of the program areas to review applicationsor proposals submitted on a competitive basis. Some awards will be negotiateddirectly with organizations that are uniquely qualified to provide specificservices. Such awarding processes are described in this announcement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Outline of Contents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Recommendations to Applicants</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Evaluation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Subpart I_Prevention and Education Programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Subpart II_Apprehension Programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Subpart III_Prosecution Programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Subpart IV_Adjudication Programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Subpart V_Corrections Programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Subpart VI_Information Systems Programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Subpart VII_Other Programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendations to Applicants</ITAG>A complete discretionary grant application requires a Standard Form 424``Federal Assistance.'' Copies of the form and a completed sample are availableupon request to the BJA address noted earlier. After completion of thisdocument it must be signed by a duly authorized official (Item 23) anddated concept papers do <T3>not</T3> require a completed SF424.<ITAG tagnum="84">Financial Requirements</ITAG>Discretionary grants are governed by the provisions of the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) Circular applicable to financial assistance. The Circularalong with additional information and guidance are contained in the ``Financialand Administrative Gude for Grants,'' Office of Justice Programs, GuidelineManual, OJP M7100.1 (current edition), available from the Office of theComptroller at the address noted earlier.Non-DiscriminationThe Act provides that no person shall be excluded from participation in,denied the benefits of, subjected to discrimination under, or denied employmentin connection with any activity funded in whole or in part with funds madeavailable under the Act. Applicants for discretionary grants are also subjectto the provisions of the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; section504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; Title XI of the EducationAmendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975; and the Departmentof Justice Non-Discrimination Regulation 28 CFR Part 42, Sub-parts C,D,E,and G.Intergovernmental Review of Federal ProgramsOn July 14, 1982, the President signed Executive Order 12372, ``IntergovernmentalReview of Federal Programs,'' to provide state and local governments increasedand more effective opportunities to influence federal actions affectingtheir jurisdictions. Final regulations (28 CFR Part 30) implementing theOrder for the Department of Justice were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 24, 1983 (48 FR 29238). The Order andthe regulations permit States to establish a state process for the reviewof federal programs and activities, to select which programs and activities(from a previously published list) they wish to review, to review proposedfederal programs and activities, and to make their views known to the Departmentthrough a state ``Single Point of Contact'' (SPOC). The Order and the implementingregulations revoke the former A-95 clearance process. Applicants for theseprograms, except those that are national in scope, must submit copies oftheir applications to the appropriate state Single Point of Contact, ifone has been established and if the State has selected these programs tobe covered in its review process. Copies should be sent to the SPOC atthe same time they are submitted to BJA. Under the regulations, the stateprocess has at least thirty (30) days to comment on non-competing continuationapplications and at least sixty (60) days to comment on all other applications.<ITAG tagnum="84">Evaluation</ITAG>The United States Department of Justice and the Congress have a stronginterest in determining what impact BJA programs have in state and localjurisdictions. Do they in fact lead to improvements in crime preventionand drug control, in expeditious and fair case processing and disposition,in better coordination and cooperation among criminal justice system agenciesand between these agencies and private and public organizations with whichthe system must interact and the public that the system serves? Answeringthese questions leads BJA to a strong commitment to independent and comprehensiveevaluation of programs which are initiated through discretionary and blockgrant funding.To the extent it is feasible, the announced programs contain provisionfor such evaluation. Where programs are continuations, an evaluation componentmay already exist. For new programs, evaluations may be prescribed in theprogram announcement or anticipated upon completing guidelines to be developedjointly between the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the National Instituteof Justice.These guidelines will be developed and announced in the near future andmay effect some of the programs with BJA is announcing today. For thatreason, all applicants should be aware of the need to include in theirprogram provisions for adequate documentation of what the program entailedand what it accomplished and, where individual case processing or managementis involved, should undertake adequate data collection to allow later independentevaluation.Applicants should contact the appropriate BJA contact person for theirprogram for further guidance about the evaluation requirement if applicationsare to be submitted prior to issuance of further information from BJA onthis point.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart I_Crime Prevention and Education</ITAG><T3>Program title:</T3> National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign.<T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> To continue the National Citizens' Crime PreventionCampaign which features McGruff, the crime dog, the nationally recognizedsymbol for crime prevention and his ``Take A Bite Out Of Crime'' slogan.This campaign will continue to be spread by the production and airing ofpublic service announcements; the 124 member Crime Prevention Coalitionand related activities; producing a full range of materials from brochuresto books for practitioners, citizens, and youth as well as technical assistanceand training provided through national/state workshops.<T3>Background:</T3> Crime prevention has become and continues to be animportant part of our daily lives. Programs and initiatives are now implementedby Federal, state and local levels of government, community organizations,businesses, churches, civic organizations, schools, and citizens. Examplesof programs inlcude Neighborhood Watch in both urban and rural communities,Drug Prevention, Business Watch, Teen Programs, Child Safety Programs,Programs for the Senior Citizen, Arson Prevention, Safe Homes for Kids,Operation Property Identification, Home Security, and many others.The National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign was developed in 1978by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Advertising Council, Inc., and theCrime Prevention Coalition, which at that time numbered 19 members. Sincethe airing of the first ``McGruff'' public service announcement (PSA) in1980, the campaign has continued to grow and flourish. Administering the``McGruff Camapgin'' and providing Secretariat support to the Crime PreventionCoalition is the responsibility of the National Crime Prevention Council(NCPC), a not-for-profit organization that provides a wide array of servicesto a diverse constituency including individual crime prevention practitioners,agencies serving youth, community organizations, schools, corporations,law enforcement, state governments and associations, and Federal agencies.These services include technical assistance and training, high qualitymaterials, educational programs, a computerized database of nationwidecrime/drug prevention programs, a resource library, and network buildingto support Federal, state and local crime/drug prevention efforts.Through a cooperative agreement with BJA, the National Crime PreventionCouncil administers the day to day activities of the Campaign; develops,distributes, and promotes crime/drug prevention public service announcements,brochures, pamphlets, books, etc.; and provides technical assistance/trainingto support citizen based activities_convincing people that crime and drugsare not a fact of life, that better and safer communities can be developed.<T3>Program description: </T3>Elements of this BJA/NCPC cooperative agreementwill include the following: andbullet; Drug prevention and demand reduction activities, targeting ournation's youth; andbullet; Technical assistance directed at States to provide for cost-effectivedissemination of prevention information and initiatives to local governments,communities, and citizens. andbullet; Distribution of crime/drug prevention public awareness and positiveaction opportunities through ``How-to Kits,'' newsletters, brochures, andbooklets. Assistance to citizens, practitioners, community organizations, schools,business, local government, state and Federal agencies will be providedthrough: andbullet; A National Resource Library with over 1500 volumes on over 100different crime prevention topics; andbullet; A Computerized Information Center that contains over 5,000 currentcrime and drug prevention programs, the largest and most comprehensivedatabase in the United States; andbullet; A comprehensive package of crime prevention materials designedspecifically for BJA block grant recipients, States, Coalition members,and crime prevention practitioners; andbullet; National/state topical workshops and seminars; andbullet; The continuation of efforts in demand reduction by BJA and NCPC,including providing technical assistance and training to field demand reductioncoordinators of the FBI, DEA, and Border Patrol; developing and promotingdemand reduction PSA's and support materials, and assisting in demand reductionrelated activities and special events; andbullet; A national research and policy forum for the crime preventionpractitioner. Efforts to include: One National Roundtable Workshop forstate association and state policy makers, a state advisory council toprovide guidance to NCPC on national issues, and various task forces calledby BJA/NCPC to focus on specific issue problems; andbullet; The continuation of the partnership with the National Associationof Stock Car Racers (NASCAR) focusing on crime/drug prevention activitiesand PSA's using nationally recognized Motor Sports Super-Stars. andbullet; Continuation of Secretariat support to the Crime Prevention Coalition.Additional national drug abuse prevention/demand reduction activities willinclude: andbullet; Distribution of the McGruff ``Drug Prevention Kit'' to every schooldistrict in the United States; andbullet; Media: Following up on the phenomenally successful McGruff ``NoShow'' by developing a drug prevention video targeting kids 9-13 yearsof age, to be distributed to every school district in the nation; andbullet; Develop and distribute a demand reduction Resource Guide for locallaw enforcement officers; and, andbullet; Develop, monitor and evaluate neighborhood/community drug abuseprevention pilot (demonstration) projects. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>A cooperative agreement withthe National Crime Prevention Council will be continued. <T3>Award period: </T3>This supplemental cooperative agreement will befor a period of 12 months, through September 30, 1990. <T3>Award amount: </T3>The total award is $3,330,000. <T3>Due date: </T3>The National Crime Prevention Council will submit anapplication by June 30, 1989. <T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isRonald J. Trethric, Director, Community Crime Prevention Programs, 202/724-8374.<T3>Program title: </T3>Demand Reduction Demonstration. <T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To provide funding for one urban jurisdictionto demonstrate a new and innovative method to reduce the demand for drugsamong the general population. <T3>Background: </T3>The casual use of drugs among a substantial portionof the population provides a steady source of demand for drugs. Many ofthese users do not view casual use as a problem and find social acceptanceof this view.This program is intended to attract and demonstrate ideas from the communityon how social tolerance of casual use of drugs can be eliminated so thatcasual usage is actually reduced.<T3>Program description: </T3>This program is intended to provide an opencompetition among large cities and counties for new and innovative ideason how social acceptance of casual use of drugs can be reduced or eliminatedentirely, with active participation by law enforcement and other criminaljustice agencies in drug prevention and education. To provide the largestpossible impact for this program, which if successful will be replicatedin other jurisdictions, the program is limited to local units of governmenthaving a population of more than one million persons.Other than limiting the size of eligible jurisdictions and requiring thatthe program address the specific issue of reducing demand for drugs bycasual users through a reduced social tolerance, BJA is not placing anyrestrictions on the approach, scope or nature of the programs proposed.However, concept papers which are able to incorporate an objective measurementmethodology within their program design by which to demonstrate actualreduced tolerance and use, will be favored.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>This is a competition opento any local unit of government having a population larger than one millionpersons. Concept papers, not exceeding ten pages and containing a budgetsummary and narrative, are requested for consideration by BJA and a panelof individuals having expertise in the areas of criminal justice and drugabuse, prevention, and treatment fields. The proposing jurisdiction selectedwill negotiate a final application with BJA.<T3>Award period: </T3>The award will be for a 12-month period.<T3>Award amount: </T3>One grant will be awarded for up to $500,000.<T3>Due date: </T3>Concept papers must be submitted no later than March1, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isJames C. Swain, Director, Discretionary Grant Program Division, 202/272-4606.<T3>Program title: </T3>Comprehensive Community Crime Prevention Demonstration.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To implement Phase III activities of this nationaldemonstration project, which is demonstrating a comprehensive, cost effectivecrime prevention model that involves law enforcement working in cooperationwith local governmental agencies, business, community organizations andcitizens.<T3>Background: </T3>The national crime prevention demonstration siteshave played a vital role in the development of new approaches to crimeprevention. For the past several decades, the Federal Government has providedboth resources and financial assistance to cities, communities, and organizationsfor the development of new techniques and approaches to reduce crime. Theultimate goal was to transfer technology that was proven to be effectiveand could be replicated by another city, county, or State.Past crime prevention programs were examined and monitored and a new, morecomprehensive approach was developed by the BJA. The model developed isknown as the ``systems approach.'' It is proactive, institutionalizes crimeprevention throughout the law enforcement agency, utilizes crime analysis/datamanagement, involves community interaction and participation which givesthe citizen a sense of ownership, and promotes interagency cooperationby using a multi-disciplinary team of professionals to design and implementstrategies for the community.In 1986, four national crime prevention demonstration sites were selectedthrough a competitive bidding process to implement the systems approachmodel. These sites are Tucson, AZ; New Haven, CN; Jacksonville, FL; andKnoxville, TN. Phase I activities included: the institutionalization ofcrime prevention within the host law enforcement agency; developing toplevel administrative support; training of officers and community volunteersin crime prevention techniques and practices; initiating and maintainingan active neighborhood watch; crime prevention through environmental design(CPTED) and, developing a community database to be used in conjunctionwith crime analysis/data management.In the Fall of 1987, the cooperative agreements were extended to continueprogram development. Each program now utilized a process of Planning_Analysis_andService Delivery. Phase II involved: Expanding and continuing Phase I activities;targeting a crime ridden area within the city to implement intensive crimeprevention activities and municipal services; coordinating demand reductionactivities within the school system and communities served; and the intensiveanalysis of a wide range of data sources to help identify and suggest solutionsfor chronic problems.<T3>Program description: </T3>Phase III activities will specifically targetdemand reduction/drug prevention activities. Working in cooperation withthe law enforcement agency, local governmental agencies, parole/probation,businesses, media, community organizations, churches, and citizens willcoordinate and mobilize efforts to reduce crime. Initiatives will include:Increased crime prevention and demand reduction training for law enforcementpersonnel, local government and community volunteers; a prevention componentfor youth; enhancing the database; CPTED; establishing a city-wide networkor hotline; and increased promotion to city residents using local media.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>Programs in Tucson, AZ; NewHaven, CN; Jacksonville, FL; and Knoxville, TN will be continued. The institutefor Social Analysis will submit an application for continued evaluation.<T3>Award period: </T3>The cooperative agreements for the sites and grantfor evaluation will be continued for 12 months, through March 31, 1990.<T3>Award amounts: </T3>Site awards will be $125,000; up to $100,000 willbe provided to the Institute for Social Analysis to finish the evaluationof this demonstration project; the program total is $600,000.<T3>Due date:</T3> Applications are due February 15, 1989.  <T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isRonald J. Trethric, Director, Community Crime Prevention Program, 202/724-8374.Program title: Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) Regional TrainingCenters. <T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> To continue providing on-site and documentarytechnical assistance and training for law enforcement and educational personnel,and to continue transferring the concept of the DARE program to additionalStates.  <T3>Background:</T3> BJA began funding this drug prevention program in1986. Phase I provided resources for seven demonstration sites and onetechnical assistance and training site. The demonstration sites plannedand organized drug prevention programs (using the DARE program as a model)which were implemented in School Year 1987-88, and which were responsiblefor training more than 45,000 students. The technical assistance and trainingproject trained 132 police officers from the demonstration sites to teachdrug use prevention education. Findings of the demonstration projects confirmedthe need for additional training sites. BJA provided seed money for fourDARE Regional Training Centers in 1988. Those centers are providing cost-effective,quality training for DARE officers and will train approximately 2,000 additionalpolice officers during this project period. Those officers will teach ingrades K-12 and/or work with and train other officers as instructors/mentors.These supplemental awards will provide resources for continuation of existingDARE Regional Training Centers, establishment of a new Center, and provisionof technical assistance to agencies and schools implementing DARE programsin other jurisdictions.  <T3>Program description:</T3> Training will be provided for officers thatteach in grades K-12, for instructors/mentors and for updating the state-of-the-artfor students, education personnel and officers. On-site and documentarytechnical assistance will be provided for agencies and schools implementingnew DARE programs.  <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> Four supplemental awards andone new award will be negotiated with the following: Arizona Departmentof Public Safety; City of Los Angeles Police Department; Illinois StatePolice Academy; Virginia State Police Department; and, North Carolina Departmentof Justice.  <T3>Award period:</T3> All awards will be for 12-month periods.  <T3>Award amount:</T3> There will be four supplemental awards and one newaward of up to $125,000 each for a total program cost of $625,000.  <T3>Due date:</T3> Each applicant will submit a full application not laterthan January 31, 1989.  <T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isDorothy L. Everett, Program Manager, Drug Abuse/Information Systems Branch,202/272-4604. <T3>Program title:</T3> Congress of National Black Churches' Anti-DrugAbuse Program. <T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> The objectives of this program are to:  andbullet; Summon, focus and coordinate the leadership of the Black Churchin cooperation with the Department of Justice, other Federal agencies andorganizations in support of a unified message and a structural plan toenable and assist high risk target communities to more effectively combatthe problems of drug abuse and drug related crime;  andbullet; Use the leadership authority of key ministers in each target community,in conjunction with the local mayors, to forge a community-wide task forceconsisting of organizations, institutions, agencies, service providersand other prominent citizens to support the plan and specifically tailoredstrategies aimed at reducing the supply and demand for drugs and the crimeassociated with that demand;  andbullet; Mobilize groups of community residents through developmental forumsto plan, review, refine and participate in implementing these specificstrategies and to evaluate the appropriateness, utility and impact of assistingfamilies and individuals in coping with the crises created by drug abuseand drug crime; and,  andbullet; Create a new national communications network between these targetcommunities to allow for the exchange of information and comparison ofresults regarding the effectiveness of various strategies, and to forma more uniform consciousness of collective action in the fight againstdrug abuse and drug crime.  <T3>Background:</T3> Drug abuse and its attendant drug crime, which hasbeen increasing at an alarming rate in recent years, has manifested itselfextensively within black communities. There is a need to address capacitybuilding within those communities to enable community involvement in fightingthe challenge of drug crime from the perspectives of both supply and demand.  <T3>Program description: </T3>This program is intended to impact on thevalues of the Black community in its awareness of the dangers of drug abuseand drug crime and to enlist the active participation of the communityin combatting illegal drugs from both the supply side and the demand side.Within the Black community, the church and its leadership has proved tobe a primary galvanizing agent in motivating the community to act, andsustaining that motivation. The Black churches in target cities can beused as a structure to organize community involvement with traditionalcriminal justice agencies and other service providers to have a positiveimpact on reducing drug abuse and drug crime.  This is Phase III of a projected 30 month effort by the Congress of NationalBlack Churches to implement a community capacity building and mobilizationprogram within target cities, to address the issues and problems of drugabuse within the black community, and to develop srategies for action programswithin those cities. The objective of this program is to effect and facilitatecommunity involvement with criminal justice agencies and other traditionalservice-providing agencies and organizations to fight drug abuse and drugcrime through both supply-side and demand-side strategies. The local Blackchurches of the target communities will serve as the catalyst for projectimplementation.  <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>This award will be to theCongress of National Black Churches.<T3>Award period: </T3>The extension period will be 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>This project is funded with combined funds fromBJA and other sources. In FY 1989, BJA will provide approximately $150,000.The total amount from all funding sources is not known.<T3>Due date: </T3>An application is due by June 30, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isRichard H. Ward, Chief, Law Enforcement Branch, 202/272-4601.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart II_Apprehension  </ITAG><T3>Program title: </T3>Financial Investigations.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To increase the number of narcotics relatedfinancial crime investigations and prosecutions; to develop a comprehensiveoperational approach to the investigation and prosecution of narcoticsrelated financial crime, including asset recovery programs and mechanisms;and to provide financial investigation and analysis techniques trainingfor investigators, prosecutors, and analysts.<T3>Background: </T3>A clear picture of the nature of organized crime emergedfrom the records of the President's Commission on Organized Crime. Itsmethods are brutal, and its scope is pervasive. This is true for traditionalorganized crime and possibly even more so for emerging illegal drug traffickingconspiracies. These conspiratorial enterprises exist for one purpose, thetremendous profits to be obtained through crime. The principal income-generatingactivity for organized crime is the production and distribution of illegaldrugs. Recent estimates of illegal drug trafficking revenues in the UnitedStates have been as high as $150 billion a year.  Development of successful cases against organized narcotics traffickingconspiracies requires use of unique investigative techniques. Civil andcriminal forfeiture of assets are now recognized by law enforcement asan effective means of depriving illicit drug traffickers of economic supportand incentive. A formal mechanism whereby shared interdisciplinary resourcesare centrally coordinated can work to immobilize targeted offenders whomanage these networks and organizations, and to remove the assets theyhave amassed.<T3>Program description: </T3>This new progam is designed to develop andimplement centrally coordinated multi-jurisdictional financial investigationactivities involving tracing narcotics related financial transactions,analyzing movement of currency, identification of criminal financial structuresand money laundering schemes, and asset forfeiture administration. Emphasiswill be on establishment of an interdisciplinary response to commonly sharedmajor crimes related to drug trafficking conspiracies throughout a regionalareea. A formal mechanism will be identified or created whereby investigativeand prosecutorial resources can be allocated, focused, and managed againsttargeted offenses and high level offenders to achieve maximum criminaland civil remedies, and to deprive them of the financial incentives topursue illegal drug activities. Critical to the success of this progamis a shared management system of intergovernmental law enforcement/prosecutorialresources. Participation by a prosecutor will be a critical element ofthis program.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>BJA will identify potentialapplicant agencies based on their observed capacity to conduct a completeand fully coordinated demonstration program in areas in which there isa high incidence of drug abuse and drug trafficking, and to identify majordrug offenders and move those offenders expeditiously through the judicialsystem.  Of those agencies identified, BJA will make final site selection basedon the following criteria: andbullet; Joint agency management and direction of investigations and prosecutions,including the presentation of signed formal intergovernmental agreements;andbullet; A coordinated approach to the crime problem which results in amajor impact on illicit drug trafficking not achievable through a singleagency case-by-case approach;andbullet; Standardized procedures for central collection and disseminationof information for joint case administration and for investigative techniquesand approaches;andbullet; The proposed case threshold or selection criteria to be used inthe selection and prosecution of complaints;andbullet; The anticipated impact upon the criminal justice system and onthe illicit drug problem;andbullet; The organization and staffing plan; and a more specific criteria;and,andbullet; The applicant's ability to specify how funds will be used to targetinvestigations that focus on:andbullet; Uncovering how funding is raised for the illegal purchase of drugsand who provides such funding;andbullet; Discovering how profits from illegal drug transactions are laundered;andbullet; Identifying profits resulting from illegal drug trafficking;andbullet; Identifying assets acquired from illegal drug trafficking; and,andbullet; Seizing assets gained from illegal drug trafficking under RICOor Continuing Criminal Enterprise, or similar state statutes.<T3>Award period:</T3> Projects will be funded for 12 months.<T3>Award amounts:</T3> A total of 10 grant awards will be made in therange of $150,000 to $225,000, for a total of $1,800,000. A technical assistancecomponent will be provided through an award to the Institute for IntergovernmentalResearch in the amount of $300,000.<T3>Due date:</T3> Due dates for the applications from IIR and from individualsites will be negotiated with each applicant. <T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isRichard H.

To assist these efforts the Drug Enforcement Administration(DEA) coordinates the National Domestic Marijana Eradication and SuppressionProgram which promotes information sharing and provides training, equipment,investigative, and aircraft support to state and local officers. The U.S.Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are involved in a majoreffort to eradicate cannabis cultivated on federal lands. It is the stateand local law enforcement role to manage the suppression of illegal cultivationwhile DEA's role in this cooperative venture is to encourage state andlocal eradication efforts, to lend intelligence information and technicaladvice and contribute resources to participating agencies.<T3>Program description:</T3> The purpose of this program is to help statelaw enforcement agencies manage a statewide marijuana eradication program.Each project must be designed around four critical elements:andbullet; <T3>Coordination/Cooperation:</T3> Each project must be composed of participatingagencies. The senior agency administrators of the participating agenciesmust sign a formal intergovernmental agreement affirming their intent tofully participate in the coordination and operation of the project. Ata minimum, the participating agencies must include the state, one localagency, and the DEA. The State enforcement agency must serve as the applicantagency and accept responsibility for the project's administrative and financialmatters. The proposed operational eradication plan should specify the expectedstaffing required and the logistical commitment of each participating agency.andbullet; <T3>Planning:</T3> Prior to the design of specific operations, data shouldbe collected and analyzed that presents the most detailed description ofthe geographical areas in the state where marijuana cultivation may takeplace. State departments of agriculture, forestry, or natural resourcesmay contribute information. The analysis of this information together withlaw enforcement intelligence provided by local, state, and federal agencieswill be used to select criminal populations against which operations willbe directed, the types of operations needed to attach various terrains,and methods of eradication. Analysis also insists in allocating personneland equipment. Planning includes the consideration of needed agreementsor commitments from other governmental agencies or private industry; thedevelopment of policies and procedures for the operation that incorporatesuch elements as lines of authority, handling juveniles or innocent peoplelocated on or near the area where marijuana is cultivated; apprehensionof suspects; asset seizure and forfeiture of the property; and, the trainingof personnel assigned to the operation.andbullet; <T3>Administration:</T3> Administration support of the program and itsoperations is critical. Since the program is based on cooperative agreementswith other law enforcement agencies, operations are usually outside ofnormal administrative channels. Special arrangements may have to be made.Consideration should be given to the management of equipment and its maintenance/repair,the management and use of herbicides, and the transportation of harvestedevidence by truck or helicopter slings to burning or storage sites. Administrationsupport should be planned and delivered throughout each operation.andbullet; <T3>Security:</T3> All marijana eradication activities are dangerous andvulnerable. This is especially true when contact is made between law enforcementpersonnel and criminals in remote locations far from backup support. Precautionsmust be considered, not only for the participating law enforcement personnelbut for innocent persons within or entering the physical area of operations.The success of the marijuana operation depends on its ability to providesufficient evidence for prosecution, conviction, and seizure or forfeitureof property. Therefore, direct and close interaction with prosecutorialauthorities throughout each operation is critical.<T3>Eligibility and selection critera:</T3> Two state law enforcement agencieswill be selected from applications received, based upon a demonstratedneed and material included in the applications that clearly demonstratesthe ability to:andbullet; Increase detection and eradication of cannabis cultivation;andbullet; Increase arrest and prosecution of cultivators and distributors,including their ability to follow through with asset seizures and forfeitures;andbullet; Provide training for the state and local officers participatingin the operations;andbullet; Provide for maximum safety for the officers and innocent civiliansduring operations;andbullet; Identify any new or unusual cultivation trends or techniques;and,andbullet; Develop and implement cooperative efforts with Federal and localagencies.<T3>Award period: </T3>Site awards will be for a period of 12 months.<T3>Award amount:</T3> Two successful applicant agencies will be awardedapproximately $250,000 each.<T3>Due dates:</T3> Applications are due March 1, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isRichard H.

To ensure that law enforcement agencies throughoutthe nation have every means possible to enforce state and local laws relatingto the production, possession, and transfer or sale of controlled substances,BJA offers technical assistance and training support through the NarcoticControl Technical Assistance Program (NCTAP). A cooperative agreement wasawarded as a result of a competitive process in FY 1987, which createda partnership between BJA and the Institute for Law and Justice, Inc. (ILJ),for the purpose of managing and delivering this technical assistance andtraining program.<T3>Program description:</T3> The Narcotic Technical Assistance and TrainingProgram will continue to:andbullet; Design and deliver nationwide training on a regional and requestbasis in topics including, but not limited to, drug investigations, supervisionof drug units, narcotics street sales enforcement, use of microcomputersin narcotics investigations, narcotics enforcement and organized gangs,and advanced narcotics investigations;andbullet; Design and conduct a program to provide technical assistance innarcotics control to law enforcement agencies, including BJA grantees,nationwide;andbullet; Monitor and assess the progress of BJA discretionary granteesconducting narcotics-related law enforcement programs, and improve coordinationand communication among grantees by conducting periodic management ``cluster''conferences and personnel exchange programs;andbullet; Conduct research, prepare, and disseminate program briefs, legalissues papers, monographs, handbooks, and other reports on narcotics-relatedtopics;andbullet; Design, develop, test and disseminate a variety of personal computer-basedinformation/records systems to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, coordination,and communication of narcotics units and agencies;andbullet; Conduct a series of gang suppression strategy conferences, toprovide state and local law enforcement policy makers with a broad rangeof ideas on gang suppression techniques;andbullet; Design, develop, and test a Field Training Officer (FTO) Programthat will apply FTO techniques to narcotics investigators, to be implementedin four sites across the United States and result in a manual for implementationthat can be used by narcotic commanders in state and local law enforcementagencies, with the long term result of an overall increase in the effectivenessof narcotic investigations;andbullet; Design, produce and conduct a program for overall coordinationof service delivery by all law enforcement technical assistance and training(TA/T) providers funded by the Omnibus Drug Initiative Act of 1988; and,andbullet; Design and conduct a program to provide training and technicalassistance to State and local forensics crime laboratory technicians andmanagers.The latter activities would include:andbullet; Serving as clearinghouse for all requests for assistance fromstate and local law enforcement agencies to BJA TA/T providers;andbullet; Assigning, with BJA approval, TA/T requests to appropriate providers;monitoring TA/T delivery; andandbullet; Producing a report on effectiveness of TA/T strategies with suggestionsfor modifications or improvement.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> The existing cooperative agreementbetween BJA and the Institute for Law and Justice, Inc., will be continued.<T3>Award period:</T3> This cooperative agreement will have a durationof 12 months.<T3>Award amount:</T3> The award will be in the amount of $750,000.<T3>Due date:</T3> The due date for the supplemental application will benegotiated with ILJ.<T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isRichard H. Ward, Chief, Law Enforcement Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title:</T3> Crack/Focused Substance Enforcement Demonstration.<T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> To improve the capabilities of state and locallaw enforcement agencies to investigate and immobilize crack cocaine traffickingorganizations, and to:andbullet; Enhance the ability of law enforcement agencies to attack higher-levelcrack cocaine trafficking organizations significant to their areas;andbullet; Increase the rates of arrests, prosecution, conviction, drug removals,and asset forfeitures related to crack traffickers and/or organizations;andbullet; Reduce the incidence of armed robberies and property related crimescommitted to support crack cocaine habits;andbullet; Reduce the incidence of violent crime (i.e., homicides) relatedto crack cocaine distribution;andbullet; Improve the ability of state and local officers to develop strongFederal prosecution against crack traffickers by utilizing the currentFederal statutes;andbullet; Increase the utilization of Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE)and Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statutes to targetand immobilize crack trafficking organizations; and,andbullet; Facilitate the development, implementation, and disseminationof intelligence information on crack trafficking organizations by all membersinvolved in the Crack Task Forces.<T3>Background:</T3> This ongoing program is a hybrid enforcement approachincorporation elements successfully utilized in Drug Enforcement Administration,state, and local Task Forces, Organized Crime/Narcotics Program (OCN) TaskForces and the old Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) OrganizedCrime Discretionary Grant Program to focus on the enforcement of ``crack''in major urban areas. The Task Force approach to drug enforcement is universallyrecognized by enforcement and prosecutorial officials as a viable methodfor dealing with drug activities and can be readily adopted to the enforcementof a specific drug problem.<T3>Program description:</T3> This ongoing effort will significantly enhancestate, local and Federal efforts to combat the rapidly growing availabilityof crack and the threat it poses to our nation. This enhancement reflectsthe basis of our overall enforcement strategy of integrated operationsand makes available the resources to establish viable Crack Task Forcesin metropolitan areas where they presently do not exist. The program includesthe participation of the U.S. Attorneys and DEA. Federal agency participationin each project is a program requirement. Grant funds will be used primarilyfor confidential expenditures (purchase of equipment/purchase of information),overtime, specialized equipment (if necessary), and some administrativecosts. DEA will pledge personnel and technical assistance support to eachof these efforts. Task force personnel will be expected to travel to andparticipate in BJA management ``cluster'' meetings of similar enforcementprojects. Grantees should allocate funds from the grant to cover the expensesof attending at least two conferences at locations to be selected at alater time.Jurisdictions selected for awards should anticipate the submission, periodically,of statistics regarding case outcomes, including, arrests, prosecutions,convictions, recoveries, and asset seizures, to assess project accomplishments.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> Only jurisdictions alreadyparticipating in this program are eligible for awards. Four to five existingsites may be continued based on past successful performance. Considerationwill be given to the level of commitment and effective utilization of theorganization's own resources to implement the project. Consideration willalso be given to the extent of the crack/cocaine problem within the applicant'sgeographical area.<T3>Award period:</T3> The project extensions will be for 12 months.<T3>Award amount:</T3> Grants will be funded at approximately $200,000each for a program total not to exceed $1,000,000.<T3>Due date:</T3> Applications will be due on or before March 1, 1989.<T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isRichard H.

For every innovative program that has succeeded, analmost identical program has been much less successful. This suggests thatjurisdictions should design and implement their own program tailored totheir own local conditions, and relying on the full range of local lawenforcement, municipal, and community resources available. Collection andanalysis of drug market and abuse data is important. Without them, thepolice run the risk of concentrating on less important markets or individuals,or of displacing the problem to different times, places, and distributionnetworks. The lack of good information also makes it difficult to redirectefforts once they have begun.<T3>Program description:</T3> This ongoing demonstration program will becontinued in some, if not all existing sites, for the purpose of strengtheningurban enforcement and prosecution efforts targeted on street narcoticsdealers and buyers.At a minimum, site applications selected for continuation funding shouldaddress the following program elements:andbullet; Data collection and analysis for identifying and using availableresources and for using results of internal evaluation to revise programsto fit changing conditions;andbullet; Emphasis on early involvement of the prosecution and court functionsto ensure that both citizen's rights and system impact issues are addressed;andbullet; Training and utilization of uniformed personnel, and certifyinguniformed officers as narcotics and illicit drug experts for testifyingin court;andbullet; Deployment of street teams for on-going investigations and arrestsof street drug traffickers, and for being responsive to citizen complaints;andbullet; Vigorous enforcement effort to arrest and convict illicit narcotic/drugusers;andbullet; Organization and deployment of mobile task forces to target thoseareas of the city where street sales have become blatant;andbullet; An undercover buy program concerned with enforcement efforts aimedat the street retailer who has become the most observable manifestationof narcotic trafficking;andbullet; Asset seizure and forfeiture efforts when practical; and,andbullet; Coordination of project mission with cognizant forensic laboratoryand jail or holding facilities.Project personnel will be expected to travel to and participate in BJAmanagement ``cluster'' meetings of similar enforcement projects. Granteesshould allocate grant funds to cover the expenses of attending at leasttwo conferences at locations to be selected at a later time.Jurisdictions selected for awards should anticipate the submission, periodically,of statistics regarding case outcomes, including, arrests, prosecutions,convictions, recoveries, and asset seizures, for the purpose of assessingproject accomplishments.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>Up to seven existing sitesmay be continued based on successful performance.

Ward, Chief, Law Enforcement Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>Clandestine Laboratory Enforcement Training andCertification.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To provide law enforcement officials, with theinformation necessary to safely investigate clandestine laboratories inaccordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's standards.<T3>Background: </T3>Safety, legal, administrative, and regulatory issuessurrounding the seizure of clandestine laboratories and the prosecutionof criminals responsible for the laboratories are very complex. Law enforcementofficials are beginning to have a better understanding of the special kindsof information needed by our uniformed and non-uniformed officers and investigators.This information has been accumulated through the detection and seizureof several hundred clandestine laboratories. These hard-won experienceshave helped to identify the hazards associated with these operations. Clandestinelaboratories contain poisonous, flammable, and explosive chemicals. Thesechemicals are used, by criminals, with inadequate training and equipmentto perform dangerous syntheses of controlled substances. There is a cleardanger to the immediate community adjacent to the clandestine laboratoryand to law enforcement officers assigned to these investigations.<T3>Program description: </T3>BJA will enter into an inter-agency agreementwith the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to provide certified trainingto state and local law enforcement investigators assigned to seize clandestinelaboratories, collect dangerous chemicals as evidence for prosecution,and transport and store dangerous chemicals.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>An inter-agency agreementwill be negotiated between BJA and DEA.<T3>Award period: </T3>This project will be funded for 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>The agreement amount will be $150,000.<T3>Due date: </T3>The date of the agreement will be negotiated with DEA.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isRichard H. Ward, Chief, Law Enforcement Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title:</T3> Narcotics Task Force Technical Assistance and Training.<T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> To provide specialized technical assistanceand training in the area of multi-jurisdictional law enforcement and prosecutionapproaches to narcotics trafficking. This program is designed to assiststate and local criminal justice agencies develop and implement sharedmanagement programs involving multiple jurisdictions directed toward disruptingillegal narcotics trafficking at the highest conspiratorial levels. <T3>Background:</T3> A clear picture of the nature of organized crime emergedfrom the records of the President's Commission on Organized Crime. Itsmethods are brutal, and its scope is pervasive. This is true for traditionalorganized crime and possibly even more so for emerging illegal drug traffickingconspiracies. The principal income-generating activity for organized crimeis the production and distribution of illegal drugs. Recent estimates ofillegal drug trafficking revenues in the United States have been as highas $150 billion a year. Developing successful cases against organized narcotics trafficking conspiraciesrequires use of unique investigative techniques. Civil and criminal forfeitureof assets are now recognized by law enforcement as an effective means ofdepriving illicit drug traffickers of economic support and incentive. Aformal mechanism whereby shared interdisciplinary resources are centrallycoordinated can work to immobilize targeted offenders who manage thesenetworks and organizations. <T3>Program descritpion: </T3>The Institute for Intergovernmental Research(IIR) will both provide and manage the delivery of technical assistanceand training services for multi-jurisdictional law enforcement and prosecutionefforts. These services will be provided in conjunction with the continuingcoordination role of IIR with regard to several ongoing enforcement programs.Expertise and examples derive from the Organized Crime Narcotics TraffickingProgram (OCN) and Statewide Drug Prosecutions (SDP) programs will be appliedto other jurisdictions experiencing similar problems on an as needed basisafter approval by BJA. The inter-jurisdictional nature of drug trafficking today requires cooperationand coordination not only among multiple law enforcement agencies, butalso between law enforcement and prosecution. These coordinated effortsface many unique impediments which must be overcome in order to assureeffective operations. Technical assistance and training will be providedin areas including: Geographical differences; varying authorities and disciplines;interagency agreements; case control; case management and tracking (includingthe use of micro-computer capabilities); investigative target selection;matters of liability; and, conflicts in agency policy and procedures. Training and technical assistance needs in these areas will be providedafter being identified and verified. Appropriate expert resources capableof delivering the needed information will be identified, and either providedby IIR staff or located from other expert sources throughout the U.S. andcoordinated by IIR. Training and technical assistance will be providedon a multi-agency and interdisciplinary basis. In that inter-jurisdictionalcriminal conspiracies are involved, part of the service coordination willinvolve identification of key agencies affected_local, state and Federal,and law enforcement, prosecution and other_and assuring their interfacein receiving the technical assistance and training. In order to provide service delivery as efficiently as possible, considerationwill be given to cost savings, costs sharing by the recipient, short termuse of practitioners from operational agencies, regional scheduling, anduse of current OCN and SDP resources wherever relevant and practical. Technicalassistance needs will be handled by screening and verifying assistancerequested, developing a pool of practitioner experts, facilitating andproviding assistance, arranging follow-up, and evaluating service provision.Training needs will be met by developing course curricula, selecting trainingsites, developing a pool of expert instructors, delivering and supervisingservices, and evaluation of training. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> This award will be made tothe Institute for Intergovernmental Research to expand efforts under theOCN Program awarded in FY 1987. <T3>Award period: </T3>The duration period for this supplemental grantwill be 12 months. <T3>Award amount:</T3> One award will be made for $100,000. <T3>Due date: </T3>A due date for a formal application will be negotiatedwith IIR.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isRichard H.

Local and state level officials in 16states are being trained under the program which focuses on investigationand forfeiture under state, rather than Federal statutes. Other aspectsof the program are a series of ground-breaking asset forfeiture publicationsand a newsletter for professionals in this important new field within lawenforcement.<T3>Program description: </T3>BJA will extend the program through FY 1989,providing six additional states with specialized training, adding two issuesof the newsletter, and continuing the technical assistance and host visitfunctions.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>The Police Executive ResearchForum will receive a supplemental award.<T3>Award period: </T3>The award period will be 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>An award of up to $500,000 will supplement the existingcooperative agreement.<T3>Due Date: </T3>The Forum should apply for the supplement by February15, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isFred W.

These gangs generally are of some specific ethnic orientation,and pose very difficult cultural and operational problems for law enforcement.The gangs to be targeted under this initiative are those that are expansionistand entrepreneurial in character. They typically spread from a core geographicallocation to other cities, where they franchise the drug market by eitherabsorbing existing networks or replacing them through the use of intimidationand violence.We know through efforts funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency(OJJDP) and the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) that, while these gangsare youth oriented with heavy juvenile involvement, they are generallyheaded by young adults 18 to 25 years of age. This program represents aninitiative aimed at gang drug trafficking and drug related violent crime,and is focused upon gang leadership.<T3>Program description: </T3>The Urban Street Gang Drug Trafficking EnforcementProgram is a demonstration program directed at the investigation and prosecutionof drug distribution and drug related violent crimes by organized urbanstreet gang networks. The focus of the program is on mid-level ``crack''cocaine distribution. The program will concentrate on influential and controllinggang members.To enhance their investigative and prosecutorial activities under thisprogram, grantees will be expected to:andbullet; Develop strategies to recognize and suppress emerging gang narcoticsdistribution and related activities; and,andbullet; Develop a formal and integral working relationship between lawenforcement and Federal, state or local prosecution authorities to investigateand prosecute gang members as part of a conspiratorial entity or enterprisewhere possible.Critical elements to be considered under this program are:andbullet; Coordination with other components of the criminal justice system(e.g. probation and parole); and,andbullet; Willingness and ability to share information with other granteesin this program to the extent permitted by law.The program does not include:andbullet; A focus on juvenile crime;andbullet; Street-level gang sweeps by police;andbullet; Prevention or treatment components; or,andbullet; Funding for non-operational consultants (e.g. training or evaluation).This program will be coordinated with the Office of Juvenile Justice andDelinquency Prevention to augment that office's companion efforts aimedat urban street gangs.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>This is a competitive program.Applicants representing cities or multiple contiguous jurisdictions witha population in excess of 250,000, and which are able to demonstrate ahigh level of urban street gang drug distribution and drug related violentcrime, are eligible for funding consideration.<T3>Award Period:</T3> Grants will be for a 12-month period<T3>Award amount:</T3> Two grants will be awarded for approximately $250,000each, for a total program of up to $500,000.<T3>Due date:</T3> Applications should be submitted no later than February15, 1989.<T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isRichard H. Ward, Chief, Law Enforcement Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title:</T3> Narcotics Enforcement in Public Housing.<T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> To develop and implement a strategy to improvecitizen security and the quality of life in public housing areas throughthe reduction of narcotics trafficking.<T3>Background:</T3> While the problems of illicit drug use and drug traffickingin public housing units vary from development to development, they havebecome a major concern to law enforcement authorities. A majority of themillions of people living in our public housing complexes are, like theirneighbors in other communities, honest, hardworking people who want torid their housing complexes of the scourge of drugs. They want their developmentto be a place where they and their children can live, play, wait for aschool bus, and visit neighbors without having to confront the violenceassociated with drug trafficking and use. In some cities, municipal policehave been reluctant to undertake a visible active presence in public housing.The reasons, which are varied, may reflect local politics, friction betweenresidents and police, or a lack of coordination between the Public HousingAuthority and the police department.<T3>Program description:</T3> The purpose of this program is to inviteapplications from urban law enforcement agencies to conduct a comprehensivedrug enforcement program within targeted public housing complexes. It isnot BJA's intention to set out specific critical elements of a programfor which applicants are asked to respond, but rather to solicit from lawenforcement agencies their ideas for developing and implementing a strategyto solve the problems of narcotic trafficking and the declining qualityof life within the complexes. The following information, however, shouldbe included in the application:andbullet; A demographic description of the identified geographical targetarea;andbullet; A commitment to using department personnel and citizens, by wayof the establishment of a project advisory group, to develop the department'sstrategy for identifying drug problems and for seeking solutions to theseproblems;andbullet; The identified Project Director, usually at the rank of lieutenantor above, with a commitment that, if possible, the officer remain the ProjectDirector for the life of the project;andbullet; A commitment, if appropriate, to assign a permanent police squadto the housing complex, the strength of which should be based on the department'sanalysis of the problems faced by the residents of the complex;andbullet; A description of the commitment by local political decision makersto provide resources as needed to support project activities;andbullet; A description of anticipated project approach and activities;and,andbullet; A description of the project's relationship with other activitiessponsored by Housing and Urban Development (HUD).Applicants are encouraged to provide letters of support from appropriatemunicipal leaders and private institutions to ensure that the proposeddrug enforcement plan has the necessary support. In addition, the successfulapplicants will be asked to provide selected data to BJA during the durationof the program so that project accomplishments can be monitored and assessed.Information may be disseminated among other law enforcement agencies.Grantees are required to send representatives to program management ``cluster''conferences. Funds should be allocated from the grant to cover the expensesof personnel to attend at least two conferences at locations to be selectedat a later time.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> Applicants are limited tourban law enforcement agencies. Grants will be awarded through a competitiveprocess. Since the key to the success of these projects rests with thelevel of commitment from the sites, selection will be made based on thecommitment of the chief of police, the mayor, city manager, the publichousing director, the sanitation code enforcement authority, the prosecutor,the residents of the target area and the demonstrated relationship withthe local Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office. The severity of theproblem, the agencies approach to solve the problem and the proposed useof grant funds will also be taken into consideration.<T3>Award period:</T3> Awards will be for a period of up to 12 months.Projects may need three to four months for data collection and analysis,selection of personnel, training, and coordination with other agenciesand the community prior to full implementation.<T3>Award amount:</T3> Two applicants will each be awarded grants up to$250,000 for a BJA program total not to exceed $500,000.<T3>Due date:</T3> Applications are due on or before March 15, 1989.<T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information onthis program is Richard H. Ward, Chief, Law Enforcement Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title:</T3> Expert Systems for Residential Burglary Investigations.<T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> To demonstrate the feasibility and practicalvalue of artificial intelligence systems to assist police personnel tosolve burglaries; to demonstrate the transferability of system rules fromone jurisdiction to another with only moderate revisions; and, to demonstratemanagement modes and strategies for effective utilization and institutionalizationof expert systems.<T3>Background:</T3> Currently BJA is sponsoring demonstrations in threesites of burglary expert systems. The three, Tucson, AZ, Charlotte, NC,and Rochester, NY, are based on the prototype now operating in BaltimoreCounty, MD, with some reference to the work being done in Devon-Cornwall(U.K.) as well. (The seminal work for a burglary expert system was donein Devon-Cornwall.)<T3>Program description:</T3> BJA will expand the network of demonstrationsites from three to four to demonstrate the model in one more diverse lawenforcement environment. The additional site will make the model more accessibleto officials in another region, and the network of users/local experts/technicalassistance resources will be increased to the benefit of the law enforcementcommunity.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> BJA will modify and supplementthe current cooperative agreement with the Jefferson Institute for JusticeStudies.<T3>Award period:</T3> The extension period will be 12 months.<T3>Award amount:</T3> Up to $100,000 in supplemental funding will be awarded.<T3>Due date:</T3> The Jefferson Institute for Justice Studies should submitan application on or before February 15, 1989.<T3>Contact Person: </T3>The BJA contact for further information is FredW. Becker, Program Manager, Law Enforcement Branch, 202/272-4605.<T3>Program title: </T3>Drug Evaluation and Classification Demonstrationand Documentation.<T3>Goals objectives: </T3>This program will continue to provide stateand local criminal justice agencies with documented procedures for thedetection of categories of drug-impaired suspects of drug-related offenses.<T3>Background: </T3>State and local law enforcement have dealt with agrowing number of cases in which drivers, who are clearly impaired, haveregistered below the legal level for impairment on generally used testsfor the presence of alcohol. It has been the general view that many ofthese drivers are impaired by other or additional drugs for which testshave not been routinely administered. Recent statistics from the Departmentof Transportation (DOT) indicate that one in ten Driving Under the Influencearrests involves additional drugs and that about one quarter of automobilecrashes involve additional drugs. Limited data from shock trauma centersindicate the presence of drugs in more than a quarter of such crashes.In response to this problem, the Los Angeles Police Department has developedand, with the DOT, over the past ten years, has refined a specific procedureand training curriculum for drug impairment recognition and classification.The Drug Evaluation and Classification Process is a standardized, systematicmethod of examining a person suspected of a drug-related offense, to determine:Whether the person is impaired; whether the impairment is drug-related;and which of seven categories of drugs is the likely cause of impairment.This rather unobtrusive examination has successfully undergone validationtesting in both clinical and field settings. It has been used to establishprobable cause for chemical testing of suspects and also as an independentbasis for prosecution in some cases. It is more general than chemical testingprocedures, in that it identifies categories of drugs (e.g., central nervoussystem stimulants) rather than specific drugs (e.g., cocaine). It is morespecific than chemical testing procedures, in that it identifies drugsthat are psycho-active at the time of testing rather than simply presentin the body and it identifies classes of drugs (e.g., hallucinogens) whichare psycho-active at such low dose levels as to be difficult to detectthrough chemical analysis.DOT's National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, along withthe Los Angeles Police Department and the International Association ofChiefs of Police, has been transferring this program through training atpilot site in Arizona, Colorado, New York and Virginia. BJA has providedsupport for this effort and will continue that support by providing resourcesfor continued demonstration, documentation and transfer.<T3>Program description: </T3>Under an Interagency Agreement, negotiatedwith DOT, BJA, will provide support for additional training resources totransfer the Drug Evaluation and Classification Process to pilot sites.BJA has received specific documentation of this process, and its refinementthrough transfer, and makes this information available in monograph formto guide potential block grnat and state and local resource allocation.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>An Interagency Agreement willbe negotiated with the Department of Transportation.<T3>Award period: </T3>This award will be for 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>One award will be made in the amount of $100,000.<T3>Due date: </T3>The date of this agreement will be negotiated with DOT.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isJohn Gregrich, Chief, Drug Abuse/Information Systems Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>Portland, Oregon, Clandestine Lab Program.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To provide funding for a program in the Portland,Oregon, metropolitan area designed to attack problems caused by clandestineactivities.<T3>Background: </T3>The Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area has been experiencingan inordinate problem with clandestine laboratory operations.

Both Federal and statecases worthy of prosecution and asset seizure often are delayed while assetsdisappear. Federal resources are limited and local criminal justice agenciesare necessarily committed to the investigation and prosecution of criminalviolence as a high priority.In August 1988, BJA initiated a project designed to promote the increaseduse of civil RICO proceedings against narcotic trafficking enterprises.Two state Attorneys General are being selected to develop prototype projectsshowing the feasibility of developing and applying state civil RICO statutesin combating drug networks and in seizing their unlawfully obtained assets.<T3>Program description:</T3> This new effort will demonstrate the fullrange of civil RICO enforcement strategies against drug trafficking andproduce models for the appropriate application of civil RICO remedies againstthe entire spectrum of drug trafficking enterprise activity. State AttorneysGeneral in their primary role as chief state law enforcement officer willreceive financial and technical assistance and training to comprehensivelydemonstrate the effectiveness of state civil RICO proceedings in attackingdrug trafficking enterprises and freezing and seizing illegally obtainedassets. Based on analysis of the experienced Attorneys Generals' officesand the prototype projects developed under the current BJA-funded StateCivil RICO Technical Assistance Project, this new demonstration effortwill significantly enlarge the scope of this very promising approach inattacking drug trafficking enterprises.In addition to initiating prototype civil RICO units, financial assistancewill enable already established civil RICO efforts to demonstrate the effectivenessof complex financial investigation and coordinated criminal and civil proceedingsinvolving local, state, regional and Federal enforcement resources in attackingmajor, statewide drug enterprises and their networks of money launderingactivities. The on-going state civil RICO technical assistance projectwill be providing technical assistance and training both to the prototypeand these demonstration sites and to other state civil RICO drug enforcementprograms. In addition, the project is developing model pleadings, statutesand practice and procedures manuals and guidelines for Attorneys Generalwho wish to develop a civil RICO unit.Up to three demonstration projects will be selected to demonstrate thefull range of civil RICO litigation techniques and practice and procedurefor detecting, freezing, forfeiting, managing and sharing of unlawfullyobtained assets will be documented, published and distributed. Technicalassistance will continue to be provided by the existing BJA State CivilRICO Technical Assistance Project, administered by the National Associationof Attorneys General.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> Selected state Attorneys Generalwill be the grantees. The Bureau of Justice Assistance will select thedemonstration projects based in part upon the recommendations of the NationalAssociation of Attorneys General and the current project staff administeringthe State Civil RICO Technical Assistance Project. Selection criteria include:andbullet; An existing, effective state civil RICO statute;andbullet; Identified, feasible drug racketeering enterprise cases;andbullet; Dedicated narcotics investigative resources within the Officeof the Attorney General, or by virtue of law enforcement working relationshipswith other agencies;andbullet; Cooperative relationships with local, state and Federal agenciesincluding regional narcotics task forces and Law Enforcement CoordinatingCommittees;andbullet; Availability of essential criminal drug enforcement tools andauthority such as grand jury, subpoena power, use immunity, forfeiture,and electronic surveillance; andandbullet; Demonstrated capacity to conduct financial investigations andcomplex civil or criminal litigation.<T3>Award period:</T3> These projects will be funded for up to a 12 monthperiod.<T3>Award amount:</T3> Two or three state Attorneys General Offices willbe selected to receive up to $200,000 for each demonstration project fora program total of $400,000.<T3>References:</T3> The National Association of Attorneys General, Hallof the States, 444 N.

APRI's staff, guided by policiesset by the National District Attorneys Association's (NDAA) Drug ControlCommittee (44 elected prosecutors) and the collective experience and provenexpertise of these 44 prosecutors' narcotic unit chiefs, is identifyingand documenting the innovative policies, strategies, procedures and techniquesfor the investigation, prosecution and management of drug cases. This projectis also the primary technical assistance and training resource for BJA'sprosecution-based demonstration projects and similar block grant fundedprojects. The project staff, expert consultant services and documentedinformation are also available, on a limited basis, to local prosecutorsrequiring assistance in the investigation and prosecution of drug cases.<T3>Program description: </T3>This ongoing national-scope technical assistanceand training project identifies, documents and makes available informationon proven investigative and prosecutorial approaches currently being utilizedby some of the more innovative of the nation's local prosecutors to prosecuteand convict drug offenders (both users and traffickers). Based upon theseproven, innovative policies and strategies, recommended approaches, proceduresand techniques are being documented to encourage the wide transfer andimplementation of these effective prosecution efforts. Printed informationand expert consultant services along with comprehensive prosecutorial trainingprograms have been developed for dissemination. These technical assistanceand training efforts are available for local prosecutors to fully considerand adopt various proven, innovative approaches to enhance their prosecutionand conviction of drug offenders. In addition, this program provides comprehensivetechnical assistance and training to BJA's demonstration and block grantfunded drug prosecution program. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>The current cooperation agreementwith APRI wil be supplemented. <T3>Award period. </T3>This on-going 18 month program, initially fundedfrom FY 1987 funds, may be extended by a supplemental award. <T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $200,000 will be added to this project todesign and conduct an evaluation of the BJA prosecutor-based demonstrationprogams. An operational, performance assessment of various innovative localprosecutor-based drug investigation and prosecution efforts may also beincluded in this supplementation. <T3>Due date: </T3>The due date for a supplemental application will beMarch 31, 1989. <T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for further information is CharlesM. Hollis, Chief, Prosecution Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>Innovative Drug Prosecution Inter-JurisdictionalDemonstration. <T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To demonstrate that prosecutors along with lawenforcement agencies working in a multiple county/judicial district taskforce organization can successfully identify, investigate, apprehend andprosecute organizations or individuals engaged in drug offense activitythat cuts across jurisdictional lines. <T3>Background: </T3>Prosecutors understand that criminal organizationsand individuals dealing in illicit drugs do not confine their activitiesto the political boundaries of a state, county, or municipal area. However,these boundaries do represent jurisdictional limitations of criminal justiceagencies committed to the identification, investigation, apprehensive andprosecution of drug related crime. These jurisdictional limitations toofrequently allow major drug distributors to avoid law enforcement and prosecutorefforts to effectively prosecute and curtail their multi-faceted activity.Apprehension and prosecution focused within a single jurisdiction oftensimply shifts the locus of illegal activity from one geographic area toanother and allows it to continue and to flourish regionally. To succeedin prosecuting and convicting these larger networks of drug offenders andenterprises, a task force of committed prosecutorial and investigativeresources from two or more jurisdictions is necessary. <T3>Program description: </T3>As the chief law enforcement official intheir respective counties/judicial districts, the prosecutors must takethe lead in determining the required inter-jurisdictional policies, operationalcooperation and dispute resolving mechanisms necessary to establish aneffective multi-jurisdiction task force. Though flexibility in the organizationand membership of the task force is desirable, program objectives, policiesand procedures must be well-defined. The task force should consist of localitiesand jurisdictions which share common and identifiable illegal drug distributionactivities. The purpose of this program is to facilitate the establishment, or to enhanceexisting inter-jurisdiction task forces to demonstrate the effectivenessand improved results of this organizational approach. The individual jurisdictionsparticipating in the task force must contribute the necessary investigationand prosecution resources to support and staff the task force. Federalfunds may be used to hire qualified staff or consultant services to enhancethe coordination and management of the task force and its ability to conductcomplex investigations and prosecutions in areas utilizing electronic surveillanceand financial transactions. The task force must be led by one of the participating prosecutors. Thisprosecutor must be willing to assume overall operational responsibilityand financial administration for the Federal funds. The task force mustbe comprise of the prosecutors from each of the participating jurisdictionsand to the degree necessary, law enforcement officials from each participatingjurisdiction. In order to be considered for this demonstration effort, at a minimum theproposed or existing inter-jurisdictional task force should address orinclude the following information in its proposal (concept paper): andbullet; The need for the task force organization with particular attentionpaid to: andbullet; The types of drug crimes or organizations which exist in the regionwhich are inter-jurisdictional in nature; and,  andbullet; The specific approaches in which the inter-jurisdictional taskforce will address the regional drug prosecution problem; andbullet; The goals of the task force with particular attention paid tothe stated need for the task force; andbullet; The objectives of the task force indicating the manner in whichthese objectives will be measured to indicate attainment of the goals;andbullet; The proposed organization of the task force indicating: andbullet; What jurisdictions wil be involved;andbullet; The task force organizational structure and resources committed,including the total number and direct relationship of each police and prosecutionagency within the task force structure, including a discussion of personnelresources which will be contributed, the total number of agencies participating,and their relative size;andbullet; How policies will be established for the task force;andbullet; How priorities and targets will be determined;andbullet; How the work load will be divided among the members of the taskforce;andbullet; How decision-making will occur;andbullet; What mechanism will be established to resolve disputes;andbullet; The amount of non-personnel resources which will be contributed;andbullet; A one page budget summary indicating each jurisdiction's commitmentand how the Federal funds are to be utilized; andandbullet; Actual interagency agreements indicating each jurisdiction's cooperationin the task force or letters of support from each proposed prosecutor indicatinga willingness to participate. This is an essential element of any proposal.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> Applicants are limited toexisting or proposed prosecutor-based, multi-jurisdiction task force organizations.The task force's lead prosecutor should submit a concept paper of approximatelyten (10) pages addressing the six elements listed in the Program Description.In addition, existing task forces should include a summary descriptionof how the program was developed and how it is currently administered.Selection will also be dependent in part on the level of jurisdictionalcommitments, the rationale for development and effective application ofboth the local and Federal resources, and agreement to participate in aproject evaluation process.<T3>Award period:</T3> The awards will be for a 12-month period.<T3>Award amount:</T3> Two or possibly three grants of up to $200,000 eachwill be awarded to demonstrate this approach for a program total of $450,000.<T3>Due date:</T3> Concept papers are due no later than March 15, 1989.<T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isCharles M. Hollis, Chief, Prosecution Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title:</T3> Statewide Drug Prosecution Technical Assistanceand Demonstration.<T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> To develop statewide enforcement and prosecutionprojects that enable states with statutory authority but without the necessarycoordination of resources to effectively attack statewide drug traffickingoffenders.<T3>Background:</T3> BJA has funded seven statewide prosecution units todemonstrate the enhanced abilities of statewide coordinated narcotics andfinancial investigators and prosecutions. States were selected that werecommitted to the concept of creating a statewide capacity to detect, investigateand prosecute major drug trafficking conspiracies and to identify, seize,forfeit and share the unlawfully obtained drug proceeds and assets througha centralized, cooperative effort by local, state and Federal enforcementagencies.The States vary greatly in their law enforcement organization and allocationof enforcement authority and jurisdiction. Different States have experiencedvery different problems in attempting to enforce criminal drug laws andto focus all of a state's resources on major drug offenders and conspiracies.State Attorneys General's Offices or comparable statewide prosecutor'soffices having criminal prosecution authority have been chosen to serveas demonstration projects for the several differing approaches to providingcoordinated selection, investigation and prosecution of drug trafficking.<T3>Program description:</T3> Several statewide prosecution projects havebeen funded to develop centrally coordinated, multi-jurisdictional caseswithin a state and to bring statewide prosecutions. These statewide enforcementunits have or are developing formal mechanisms to coordinate investigationsand litigation resources and to target major offenders. Prosecutors willuse state statutes such as criminal, forfeiture, money laundering and conspiracy,together with state-of-the-art enforcement tools to conduct intensive financialinvestigations and mount multi-jurisdictional parallel civil and criminalprosecutions of major organized criminal groups.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>Two of the existing sevenprojects will be given limited continuation funding, based on demonstrationsuccessful performance and continuing need.<T3>Award period: </T3>The continuation period will be up to 12 months.<T3>Award amounts: </T3>Two currently funded demonstration sites will beconsidered for up to $250,000 each in continuation support. The technicalassistance component will be continued in order to support the ongoingprogram, through a grant to the Institute for Intergovernmental Researchin the amount of $200,000 for a program total of $700,000.<T3>Due date: </T3>Applications are due on or before February 15, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for further information is CharlesM. Hollis, Chief, Prosecution Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>Development of Model State Drug Control Statutes.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To develop ``model'' state statutes to strengthenthe investigation, apprehension, prosecution, and punishment capabilitiesof states in dealing with drug offenders and organizations traffickingin illegal drugs and narcotics.<T3>Background: </T3>The ability of the criminal justice system to putdrug offenders and their organizations out of business is becoming moresophisticated and in many ways more successful. As a result, drug traffickershave also developed and are using more sophisticated methods to avoid detectionand to hide the proceeds from drug enterprises. In order to address andcombat these innovative methods being used by drug traffickers at the stateand local level, new legislation must be developed. In response to thisneed, the National Drug Policy Board has suggested that ``model'' statestatutes be developed which address areas such as asset forfeiture, electronicsurveillance, and money laundering in order to assist and, in many instances,enable state and local enforcement and prosecution efforts in this area.This would allow states to utilize their own prosecutorial and court systemresources in addition to equitably sharing procedures upon which many stateand local agencies currently rely.<T3>Program description: </T3>This is a development program to formulate``model'' state statutes which respond to the increasing number of complexmethods created and utilized by drug statute offenders to avoid detectionand prosecution and the imposition of criminal and/or civil sanctions.The grantee selection will: Review existing statutes to identify what sectionsof state statutes or complete state statutes have proved successful inthe apprehension and prosecution of drug traffickers; determine what gapsexist in state statutes which prevent the detection, investigation, apprehension,and prosecution of drug traffickers; survey the states' and Federal lawsto determine which existing statutes would most likely be successful ifenacted in other states; establish the preferred structure of the modelstate statutes in order to accomplish the stated goals of investigation,apprehension, prosecution and punishment of drug traffickers; and, promotethe utilization of model state statutes across the country through thepresentation of testimony, articles and limited technical assistance.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>BJA will negotiate with severalnational organizations to obtain an application which best demonstratesthe following:andbullet; Familiarity with the recommendations of the National Drug PolicyBoard pertaining to ``model'' statute development;andbullet; Knowledge and understanding of state and Federal statutes andrelevant sections pertaining to asset forfeiture, electronic surveillance,money laundering and other pertinent areas related to drug offenses andoffenders;andbullet; Experience in the analysis, formulation and drafting of ``model''statutes based on the successful sections of state and Federal statutesconcerning the investigation, apprehension and prosecution of drug traffickers;and,andbullet; Capability to provide training and technical assistance on a nationalbasis.<T3>Award period: </T3>The project will be funded for 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>The award will be a cooperative agreement with upto $132,000 being available to support this effort.<T3>Due date: </T3>An application will be due on or before March 31, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact with additional information isCharles M. Hollis, Chief, Prosecution Branch, 202/272-4601.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart IV_Adjudication</ITAG><T3>Program title: </T3>Drug Testing and Intensive Supervision Demonstration.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To demonstrate the effectiveness of drug testingas case screening and monitoring/supervision devices during the pretrialstage.<T3>Background: </T3>For judges and magistrates, determining pretrial dispositionsof arrestees is a critical and difficult process, usually conducted hurriedlyand often with inadequate information about the arrestee, victim or crime.Inappropriate release or inadequate supervision of arrestees may resultin additional harm or trauma to victims, additional crimes perpetratedby the arrestee, and justice delayed/denied should the arrestee fail toappear for trial. Further, research supports that there is a relationshipbetween drug use and crime and that pretrial detention/release decisionsby the court should reflect consideration of accurate information aboutthe arrestee's drug abuse history and current usage.Since FY 1987, BJA has implemented pretrial drug testing and supervisiondemonstration efforts in six sites (Tucson, AZ; Portland, OR; Wilmington,DE; Phoenix, AZ; Milwaukee, WI; and Prince Georges County, MD). These effortsare based in part on the model program from the District of Columbia PretrialServices Agency and are structured to: (1) Augment existing criminal justiceinformation about arrestees used for pretrial decision-making, (2) increasethe number of pretial release options available to the court for arresteeswho are not suited for formal drug treatment, yet should not be detained,and (3) provide a more intensive, supervised program tailored for arresteesexhibiting current drug usage.<T3>Program description: </T3>The program to demonstrate the feasibilityand replication of pretrial drug testing and monitoring contains threeelements: operational sites, technical assistance, and a national-levelevaluation. Participating sites will receive extensive technical assistancethrough the Pretrial Services Resource Center (PSRC), including on-siteconsultation, host-site visits, and workshops, as required. All sites willparticipate in a national evaluation, to be conducted by the Criminal JusticeResearch Institute (CJRI), which will provide both an impact and processassessment of the individual project sites and of the total program. Oneadditional site, among those competing during last year's round, will beadded to the program.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>Based on continued demonstratedsuccess, five existing sites will be refunded; and, one additional sitewill be selected by BJA from among those competing during last year's round.The PSRC will continue to provide technical assistance and training andprogram-related documents. The CJRI will undertake the evaluation of allparticipating sites.<T3>Award period: </T3>All awards will be for 12 months of operation.<T3>Award amounts: </T3>A total of $2,600,000 is allocated for this program.Up to $2,425,000 will be available to support programs in participatingsites. Awards of up to $75,000 will be available to continue technicalassistance and training for PSRC and up to $100,000 for continued evaluationby CJRI.<T3>Due dates: </T3>Applications from the currently participating sitesare due by March 31, 1989. Applications from PSRC and CJRI are due by June30, 1989.

Increasingarrests/prosecutions add to the caseload volume and unique features attendantto adjudication of drug cases can contribute to major delays. A new technique,Differentiated Case Management (DCM), is being demonstrated and show greatpromise to further promote the expeditious processing of criminal and civilcases and guide more effective use of adjudication resources during thelife of the case. The program concept is to formally screen/assess cases,divert those cases to special processing tracks based on such factors ascomplexity, and supervise those cases (especially those which require extraordinarycoordination and use of court resources). Implicit in the success of thistechnique is the high level of planned coordination among the court, prosecutorand the public defender agencies. The strategy of Expeditious Managementof Drug Cases Program is to employ the DCM concept exclusively for casesin which one or more drug offenses are charged.<T3>Program description: </T3>Up to three courts will be selected througha competitive process to participate as demonstration sites. The selectionof sites will be based on responses to the Request for Proposals and recommendationsby an independent review panel. Emphasis in the program will be given tothose local jurisdictions which demonstrate a significant caseload comprisingof drug offenses, a coordinated case screening process among the prosecutor,public defense, and court agencies, a case management system which allocatesand schedules resources for the timely completion of cases in which thosecases, based on characteristics, are assigned to processing tracks, andan automated information system which directly supports case management.The program will be conducted in two phases: An initial three month periodin which participating jurisdictions will prepare for operations and anine month period to conduct implementation. Technical assistance willbe available in both phases to address general and specific problems.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>General jurisdiction criminalcourts will be selected based on a competitive process. The critical elements,along with selection criteria will be advertised in a Request for Proposals(RFP) to be released by March 1, 1989. Interested jurisdictions may obtainthe RFP through the identified BJA contact person. BJA will select theorganization through which technical assistance will be provided in supportof the demonstration sites.<T3>Award period: </T3>All awards will be for 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to three demonstration sites will receive awardsranging from $100,000 to $200,000 for a total of $400,000; and award upto $100,000 will be granted for technical assistance.<T3>Due dates: </T3>Proposals will be due May 1, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for further information is JayMarshall, Chief, Courts Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>TASC Program Development, Technical Assistanceand Training.<T3>Goals objectives: </T3>To continue to provide to local and state criminaljustice agencies and block grantees necessary technical assistance andtraining connected with TASC programs and to continue to define and refinethe critical elements for individual case management and accompanying performancestandards, assessment protocols and outcome measures.<T3>Background: </T3>Many evaluations have found treatment for drug-dependentoffenders to be most effective when there is direct criminal justice involvement.The threat of criminal justice sanction motivates offenders to enter treatmentand, perhaps more importantly, motivates them to stay in treatment fora period of time sufficient for behavior change. Treatment Alternativesto Street Crime (TASC) Programs have fared well in these evaluations andin the assessment of local jurisdictions; over 100 such programs continuedduring the hiatus of Federal funding, during the early 1980s. In responseto this track record, the Congress has included TASC, specifically, inthe Omnibus Drug Initiative Act as deserving of continued support. BJAhas found TASC programs to be well-evaluated but erratically documented;thus, initial program development and assistance efforts have been aimedat documentation of the core elements that make up the most effective localTASC programs and the data collection necessary to manage and assess monitoringand referral of drug-dependent offenders. This documentation of field experiencehas improved communication among TASC-like programs and has resulted ina substantial growth in the number of requests for assistance, from bothstate and local case management.<T3>Program description: </T3>This program will supplement the existingcooperative agreement with the National Association of State Alcohol andDrug Abuse Directors (NASADAD) to assist criminal justice agencies andblock grantees. Using the TASC program as a individual case managementmodel, technical assistance and training will be delivered on-site to currentTASC programs to improve program delivery and to jurisdictions wishingto begin a TASC program in their area.The TASC Program Brief will be further refined for concrete application,through the development and testing of a program assessment protocol, basedon the critical elements and performance standards of the TASC program.Once tested, this assessment tool will be made available to the field,to confirm local program performance and to foster comparisons among sites.Other anticipated areas of priority include: Regional workshops to bringtogether state criminal justice planners and state alcohol and drug abuseplanners to assist in better coordinating state programming for the drugdependent offender population; a model TASC client assessment instrumentthat provides the courts and the TASC administrator with useful information,documentation and data; training-of-trainers sessions for TASC consultants;TASC newsletter distribution to a growing list of interested individualsand organizations; and a national conference that brings together representativesfrom the criminal justice/drug treatment fields to review current informationand coordinate future efforts.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>A supplemental cooperativeagreement will be negotiated with the National Association of State Alcoholand Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD).<T3>Award period: </T3>This award will be for 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>A supplemental award will be negotiated for up to$300,000. <T3>References: </T3>The TASC Program Brief, Implementation Manual, UrinalysisMonograph, and Training Manuals_Trainer and Participant are available fromthe BJA staff member named below. <T3>Due date: </T3>Application for the cooperative agreement will be dueon or before January 31, 1989. <T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isJody Forman, Program Manager, Drug Abuse/Information Systems Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>Drug Testing Technology/Focused Offender Disposition.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To continue to provide specific, practical assistanceto local criminal justice decision-makers regarding the appropriate dispositionof drug-using offenders, by providing and demonstrating specific guidelinesfor assessing offenders and available monitoring and treatment programs.<T3>Background: </T3>Research conducted and underway by the National Instituteof Justice, continues to support a number of solid findings about drugabuse and offending (e.g., drug use is a reliable predictor of pretrialmisconduct, self-reports of drug use are not reliable, reliable technologyis available). The same drug testing research which guides much of thisdiscretionary program has highlighted certain areas of uncertainty anddisagreement. The apparent success of monitoring as a deterrent to pretrialmisconduct has led some to conclude that monitoring is an appropriate,general substitute for drug treatment. Others hold the view that monitoring,while an appropriate part of a treatment program, can promise no long termbenefits. There is general agreement, however, regarding the dilemma facedby criminal justice decision-makers who deal with drug-using offenders.In the simplest terms, most judges have great difficulty distinguishingamong offenders to determine those in need of and proper candidates fortreatment. Similarly, having decided on a treatment condition or referral,most judges have great difficulty distinguishing among treatment programs(i.e., which are credible in general; which one is right for this offender).This demonstration program is designed to address these questions directly.Over 80 decision-making instruments have been reviewed in light of recentand emerging research. From these sources a decision tool called the ``offenderprofile index'' has been developed for use at three competitively selected,demonstration sites, Birmingham, AL, Phoenix, AZ, and Miami, FL. Thesesites are just beginning to employ and assess the instrument. This continuationanticipates the successful demonstration of the offender profile indexat one or more of the sites and provides modest funding for continued demonstrationat the one or two sites which show the greatest potential for leading thetransfer of this technology. <T3>Program description: </T3>This program will continue to document anddemonstrate the options available to the criminal justice system in dealingwith the drug using offender. This continuation will support additionaldemonstration at one or more of the selected jurisdictions, to documentthe most appropriate procedures and protocols for the determination ofwhich offenders should be referred to monitoring, which should be referredto treatment, and what kind of treatment is indicated. The demonstrationwill also recommend the most appropriate criminal justice system role duringthe monitoring or treatment period. Appropriate national experts and organizationswill be called upon to advise and recommend regarding essential site protocolsand essential site data collection and analysis. Final products will includethe results of a process evaluation, in monograph or Program Brief form,and documented indicators and protocols for effective disposition of drugusing offenders. A supplement to the existing cooperative agreement willbe negotiated, with the National Association of State Alcohol and DrugAbuse Directors (NASADAD), to accomplish the necessary oversight, administrationand assistance. BJA will retain the authority for approval of experts selected,for continuation site selection criteria and for demonstration sites selectedto continue. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>A supplemental cooperativeagreement will be negotiated with NASADAD. Criteria for continuation siteselection will be developed by NASADAD and submitted to BJA for approval.BJA will make final site selection, in accordance with approved criteria.<T3>Award period: </T3>This award will be for 12 months. <T3>Award amount: </T3>One award, through a negotiated cooperative agreement,will be made, to include both oversight functions and site demonstrations.It is anticipated that one or two sites will be continued. The total awardamount, including oversight and site assistance, is $800,000. <T3>Due date: </T3>Application for the cooperative agreement from NASADADwill be due by February 24, 1989. <T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isJohn Gregrich, Chief, Drug Abuse/Information Systems Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>Adjudication Technical Assistance. <T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To provide state and local adjudication agencieswith short-term assistance addressing a number of problem areas.<T3>Background:</T3> The Adjudication Technical Assistance Program (ATAP)provides short-term technical assistance, training, resource development,and other services related to adjudication functions. ATAP assists stateand local justice systems, in support of both BJA block grant recipientsand those not receiving Federal funding, and undertakes other projectsin support of the BJA adjudication program. Areas of program concentrationinclude but are not limited to general court management issues, case processingdelay reduction, jury utilization, pertrial services including use of drugtesting, focused prosecution, and jail management capacity, with an emphasison adjudication programs which enhance processing of drug abusers and offenders.ATAP brokers requests and responds in the most appropriate way. In themajority of cases, assignments involve sending staff or consultants onsite to do short term data collection and analyses and gather other informationrelevant to the problem giving rise to the request. A report includingspecific recommendations for addressing the problem is prepared for thejurisdiction and, in some cases, follow-up assistance is provided to helpimplement the recommendations made. However, ATAP does not underwrite thecosts of implementation. Other methods of technical assistance which have been effectively usedinclude ``hosted'' visits of jurisdictional representatives making therequest in another jurisdiction which has successfully handled the sameproblem; providing speakers or arranging special sessions for national-levelprofessional court organizations' conferences; and, providing jurisdictionswith technical assistance reports and other documents relevant to theirproblem without on-site work. In addition to this type of assistance, the current ATAP develops and disseminatesa newsletter and single-issue monographs, assists BJA in special projectsof national interest, and provides follow-up to initiatives undertakenin the Adjudication Training Program. <T3>Program description:</T3> The program has been operating successfullyfor approximately three years and has assisted over 150 jurisdictions throughon-site and other types of technical assistance. To ensure BJA continuesto provide the highest quality services through the program, the awardmade this year will be based on a Request for Applications, which willbe issued in January 1989. The new award will support a program which is essentially similar to thatcurrently operating, with some possible redirection to avoid unnecessaryoverlap with newer projects which provide technical assistance in morenarrowly defined adjudication areas. Priority will be given to providingassistance to jurisdictions that have problems related to drug abuse andoffending and are not currently receiving direct aid and technical assistancefrom BJA through other ongoing discretionary programs. For example, jurisdictionsinterested in initiating a pretrial drug testing program that are not beingassisted through the Drug Testing and Intensive Supervision Program orthose interested in improving their pretrial services that are not beingassisted through the Enhanced Pretrial Services Delivery Program wouldbe eligible. Assistance which allows general court improvement, betterjail capacity management, and more effective adjudication programs overallwill also be provided, in recognition that generalized improvements inadjudication functions impact favorably on the fair and efficient processingof that substantial proportion of all offenders who are abusing drugs orare charged with drug offenses. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> One award will be made followinga competition based on a Request for Proposals (RFP) which sets forth programelements, eligibility and selection criteria, and other relevant information.While it is anticipated that this RFP will call for a program which operatesin a manner very similar to that now ongoing, some modifications are likelybased on the experiences of the current program and BJA's assessment ofprojected needs for such services during the upcoming award period. ThisRFP will be issued in December 1988 and will allow interested organizationsat least 30 days to respond. To be placed on a mailing list to receivethis RFP, write the BJA staff contact for this program listed below. <T3>Award period:</T3> The award period will be 12 months. <T3>Award amount:</T3> Up to $500,000 will be awarded as a cooperativeagreement. <T3>References: The Technical Reporter</T3>, vol. 2, nos 1 and 2 (ATAPnewsletter, which can be obtained by writing or calling program staff atthe EMT Group, Inc., 3615 Wisconsin Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20016,202/362-4183). <T3>Due date:</T3> The RFP will specify the due date for proposals. <T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isLinda McKay, Program Manager, Courts Branch, 202/272/4601.<T3>Program title:</T3> Differentiated Case Management for Trial Courts.<T3>Goals/Objectives:</T3> To demonstrate the effectiveness of a new techniquein court delay reduction which focuses on intensive case management asa means to expedite adjudication of cases, especially those cases involvingdrug abuse. <T3>Background:</T3> General court delay reduction practices have beenimplemented over the past decade, achieving great successes in reducingbacklogs and improving the timeliness of case disposition. A new technique,Differentiated Case Management (DCM), shows great promise to further promotethe expeditious processing of cases and guide more effective use of adjudicationresources during the life of the case. The program concept is to formallyscreen/assess cases to be litigated, divert those cases to special processingtracks based on such factors as complexity, and supervise those cases (especiallythose which require extraordinary coordination and use of court resources).Implicit in the success of this technique is the high level of plannedcoordination among personnel from the court, prosecutor and the publicdefender agencies.  <T3>Program description:</T3> In FY 1987, BJA intiated the DifferentiatedCase Management Program in which five jurisdictions (6 courts) receivedinitial funding to begin operations. Those jurisdictions are Camden County,NJ; Berrien County, MI; Pierce County, WA; Ramsey County, MN; and WayneCounty, MI. Emphasis is given to accelerate processing of drug abuse casesbased on established processing tracks. In addition to the demonstrationsites, the EMT Group, Inc., is providing intensive technical assistanceduring the start-up and operational phases. The National Center for StateCourts is performing site and program assessments. Although the sites havebeen in operation for only four months, interim assessment indicates thatthe program concept is contributing to more effective case management andexpediting processing. These sites will receive additional funding, basedon continued success. EMT Group and the National Center for State Courtswill receive additional monies to permit further technical assistance andassessment.  <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> The five existing sites, EMTGroup, and the National Center for State Courts are eligible for continuedfunding.  <T3>Award period:</T3> All awards will be for 12 months.  <T3>Award amounts:</T3> The demonstration sites will receive up to $75,000each for a total of $350,000; EMT Group will receive up to $75,000 fortechnical assistance delivery; and the National Center for State Courtswill receive up to $75,000 for continued assessment for a program totalof $500,000.  <T3>Due date:</T3> All applications are due February 1, 1989.  <T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isJay Marshall, Chief, Courts Branch, 202/272-4601. <T3>Program title:</T3> Enhanced Pretrial Services Delivery.  <T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> To improve the utilization and operation ofpretrial services delivery agencies nationwide.  <T3>Background:</T3> The Enhanced Pretrial Services Delivery Program beganin October 1988, addressing the operational aspects of pretrial servicesagencies, to: (1) Identify the basic elements of good agency operations,(2) highlight ``enhanced'' agencies, and (3) help jurisdictions improvetheir operations through a mix of technical assistance and direct aid.Early program tasks include conducting an extensive survey of existingagencies and/or units of adjudication agencies which are now providingsome type of pretrial services. The survey will determine to what extentthese agencies, e.g., do pre-release interviewing, make recommendationsto the court, monitor released arrestees prior to trial, and identify diversionor treatment opportunities for arrestees. In addition to a report on thesurvey results, a number of monographs and other documents are expectedto result from this initiative.  A Program Brief will describe a typical or adequate pretrial service deliveryagency operation will be prepared and issued. The type of operation describedin this document will be used in part as a baseline for identifying agenciesabove that level, i.e., as ``enhanced'' pretrial services delivery agencies.At least three enhanced agencies will be identified and used as host sitesfor other jurisdiction's pretrial services personnel. Some follow-up technicalassistance will also be offered to the sites that are hosted and the enhancedsites themselves will receive some direct assistance to facilitate thishosting process and to begin documentation of their operations for thebenefit of other jurisdictions.  <T3>Program description:</T3> The Pretrial Services Resource Center (PSRC)and the National Association of Pretrial Service Agencies (NAPSA) are workingtogether on this project. The new award will allow these groups to schedulehosted visits for more jurisdictions, provide more extensive follow-upto thse hosted visits by intermittent technical assistance and other means,and continue producing monographs on relevant topics.  A key task during this second phase will be the careful documentation ofthe operations of the enhanced sites, so that individual program componentswhich make these sites ``models'' can be more readily transferred to andimplemented by other jurisdictions.  <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> A supplemental award willbe made to the Pretrial Services Resource Center.  <T3>Award period:</T3> The award will be for a period not to exceed 12months.  <T3>Award amount:</T3> The Pretrial Services Resource Center will be awardedup to $300,000.  <T3>References:</T3> The Program Brief to be developed during Phase I ofthis program will be mailed to all persons/organizations who ask to beplaced on the mailing list; contact the BJA staff member named below. <T3>Due date:</T3> The application form PSRC will be submitted no laterthan May 1, 1989.  <T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isLinda McKay, Program Manager, Courts Branch, 202/272-4601. <T3>Program title: </T3>Large Court Capacity.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To promote systemic and permanent improvementsin court operations, especially in large jurisdiction trial courts, sothat these courts can provide fair and efficient adjudication of drug arresteesand offenders.<T3>Background: </T3>In FY 1987 BJA and the National Center for State Courts(NCSC) began a major initiative to enhance performance of large jurisdictioncourts, to meet the increasing numbers of drug and drug-related cases beingreferred for adjudication. Implicit in this program is the recognitionthat existing judicial and support resources can expeditiously handle drugarrestees by a more focused application and use of those resources. Researchand evaluation into judicial administration conclude repeatedly that additionaljudges and support staff do not, in themselves, increase the pace or performancein case processing and that increased resources may only contribute toexisting inefficiencies.Four major components of the program are: (1) Development and integrationof trial court performance standards and recognition of those trial courtswhich demonstrate achievement of those standards, (2) analysis of caseflowactivity in trial courts as a means to focus technical assistance resourceson courts which exhibit significant delays in case processing (especiallyof drug cases), (3) a review of case characteristics to support a differentiatedcase management (DCM) approach to further expedite drug case processing,and (4) identification of model automated jury management systems to facilitateadministration of jury practices/procedures.<T3>Program description: </T3>Additional funding was provided during FY1988 to complete work of the trial court performance standards componentand begin a marketing strategy to integrate the standards in courts oflarge urban areas. This award will focus on continuing the Caseflow ManagementResource Project. Under this project, the number of participating jurisdictionswill be increased to at least 30 sites from which data will be collectedand analyzed. Results from this project will be used to achieve a nationalperspective of caseflow management of our larger courts, deliver intensivetechnical assistance to courts which exhibit significant case backlogsand/or slow case processing times, and document those courts with fastertimes and facilitate technology transfer of their case management systemsto other less efficient courts. The impetus is to institutionalize casemanagement systems which are proven successful in addressing caseflow problems,in order to expedite drug and other serious cases.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>A supplemental award willbe made to the National Center for State Courts.<T3>Award period: </T3>The new award will support an additional 12 monthsof program operation.<T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $450,000 will be awarded.<T3>Due date: </T3>An application from NCSC will be due within 15 daysof the date of this announcement.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isJay Marshall, Chief, Courts Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>The Impact of Drug-related Arrests on CriminalCourts of Limited Jurisdiction.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To examine how the increasing numbers of arrestsfor drug crimes and the increasing proportion of drug users among arresteeshave effected the workload, procedures, and policies of courts of limitedjurisdiction.<T3>Background: </T3>There has been an increase in the numbers of drug-relatedarrests coming into our court system due both to increases in drug useand trafficking and increased targeting by law enforcement and prosecutorialagencies of these offenders. Some jurisdictions involved in ongoing BJAprograms report that as many as 40% of all court filings are for drug offenses.Substantial evidence now exists also, coming from the Drug Use Forecasting(DUF) Program, a joint BJA/National Institute of Justice program, that50-90% of all arrestees in major metropolitan (and even smaller) citiesare drug users.Despite the fact that nearly all arrestees are initially processed throughsome limited jurisdiction court (for probable cause hearings, bail hearings,some motions, and even plea acceptances), nearly all the ongoing studieson drugs and their relationship to criminal courts focus on the generaljurisdiction or felony-level courts. There is a pressing need to identifythe special problems which increased activities focused on drug crime haveon these limited jurisdiction courts, because improper or ineffective processingat this point may detrimentally effect substantially more case outcomesthan the numbers that are ever handled in the felony courts.<T3>Program description: </T3>This new program will focus on the actualoperations, policies and procedures, and case dispositions made by a numberof limited jurisdiction criminal courts. The grantee will be asked to developa program which includes analysis of case data, archival research, interviewsof key court and other criminal justice system personnel, and other tasksappropriate to the subject, to provide both a national and site-specificperspective and a qualitative and quantitative analysis of what impactdrug-related cases have had on these courts and how they are responding.This program will be initiated by a competition, which will be held pursuantto a Request for Proposals (RFP) to be issued by BJA in March 1989. Withinthe broad constraints discussed herein and any additional requirementsspecified in the RFP, the exact focus of, methodologies for, and analysesto be performed for this program will be those suggested by the successfulapplicant. That is, the focus of the competition for this grant will beon which application presents the best approach to this examination withinthe resources available. Those organizations interested in competing forthis grant should write the BJA contact noted below to be placed on a mailinglist for the RFP.Interested applicants should bear in mind that BJA is an action-orientedagency which is seekingf feasible approaches and solutions to problemsoccurring in the criminal justice system. Therefore, a key selection criteriawill be how the applicant proposes to structure and report program findingsand recommendations and how readily those findings and recommendationsmight be acted upon by limited jurisdiction courts to improve their operationsoverall and especially their handling of drug-related cases. <T3>Award period: </T3>This new project will be funded for an 12-monthperiod. <T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $250,000 is available for this program. <T3>Due date: </T3>The due date for proposals will be specified in theRFP. <T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contract for additional information isLinda McKay, Program Manager, Courts Branch, 202/272/4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>Family Violence and the Role of the Family Courts.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To determine if family courts, given appropriatejurisdiction over adults involved in domestic violence, can effectivelyprosecute and adjudicate abusers in order to stop violence in the home,while providing better services to the family unit than are possible throughcriminal court intervention. <T3>Background: </T3>The National Council of Juvenile and Family CourtJudges (NCJFCJ) has been working since September 1987 with three familycourts that have the jurisdiction to undertake criminal actions againstspouse abusers. In these court, the program is developing, testing, anddocumenting a strategy for responding to instances of spouse abuse whichhas as its primary goal to intervene in a way which results in permanentcessation of that violence. Since a criteria for cases included in theprogram is that the domestic violence occurred in a home where childrenreside, a secondary goal is to foster a situation which preserves the stabilityof family relationships which are likely to continue even if the abuserand victim do not want to continue their relationship (e.g., divorced parent-childin custody of other parent). The program seeks to coordinate criminal justice system and public andprivate service agencies' actions to provide a range of interventions,including criminal prosecution and sanctioning of the abuser, protectionof and necessary services for the victim of abuse, identification and responseto other types of violence or substance abuse which might be occurringin the home, and provision of longer term assistance/treatment/servicesto abuser, victim and children in the home. Consistent with this conceptof developing a unified approach to each individual family violence caseinvolving both the criminal justice system and service agencies' actionsis the potential of the family courts to coordinate or combine all actionspending in the court system relevant to anyone in the same home or family.Providing this coordination has become another objective of the program.The progress in implementation of program goals by the three sites participatingin the program (Quincy MA, Portland, OR, and Wilmington DE) is being documentedby the Center for Juvenile Justice, the research and evaluation officeof NCJFCJ. <T3>Program description: </T3>While significant progress has been madein achieving program goals, the complexity of trying to intervene effectivelyin family violence situations requires a long-term effort. Complexity ariseswhere violence by abuser to the same victim has occurred over a long periodand has become a way of life, where multiple violence (e.g., spouse andchild abuse) may be occurring, where the fear of losing the children tostate agency custody inhibits the victim from pursuing court action againstthe abuser, and where a number of civil and criminal processing optionsare not only available but may in fact have led to pending actions in severalcourts in the same jurisdiction involving one or more members of an entirefamily group. This new award will provide supplemental support for thisprogram, to allow continuing development and assessment of the feasibilityof the approach to family violence intervention now being taken in thethree participating sites. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>The current grantee, the NationalCouncil of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, will receive a supplementalaward to the cooperative agreement which supports this program's activities.<T3>Award period: </T3>The new award will cover a period of up to 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $300,000 will be awarded. <T3>Due date: </T3>An application from NCJFCJ will be submitted within15 days of the date of this announcement. <T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isLinda McKay, Program Manager, Courts Branch, 202/272/4601. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart V_Corrections </ITAG><T3>Program title: </T3>Prison Capacity Demonstration. <T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To assist states to review corrections policiesand to establish a balanced corrections system, utilizing commissions ortask forces representing all three branches of government. <T3>Background: </T3>This program is a continuation of a technical assistanceand demonstration program initiated in 1987 to assist state correctionscommissions and task forces. The Bureau of Justice Assistance initiateda fifteen-state Prison Capacity Program under a special Congressional authorizationto assist state policy makers in developing cohesive correction policies.  <T3>Program description:</T3> The program provides seed money and technicalassistance to state commissions or task forces made up of representativesof the three branches of government or to legislative committees revisingcorrections policy. Each of the commissions or task forces is consideringa wide range of corrections alternatives including prison capacity andupdated inmate population projections, distribution of populations betweenstate institutions and jails, and a wide range of alternative sanctionsincluding expanded community corrections options. Technical assistanceis provided under a grant to the National Council on Crime and Delinquency(NCCD).<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> This funding will extend thework of selected state commissions for an additional six to twelve monthsand continue technical assistance through 1989. Because of funding limitations,no new states will be added to the currently funded sites, although technicalassistance will be available.<T3>Award period:</T3> The award to NCCD and contracts with sites willbe for periods of up to 12 months.<T3>Award amounts:</T3> Up to $250,000 is earmarked for this program tobe distributed as follows: $150,000 for continuation funding in five orsix states; $100,000 for technical assistance and training activities.Currently funded states could receive supplements of $10,000 to $25,000by submission of amended work plans.The FY 1989 funds will be awarded to the current technical assistance coordinator,National Council on Crime and Delinquency, San Francisco, which will distributefunding to the states under direction of the Bureau of Justice Assistance.<T3>Due date:</T3> States currently participating in the program may submitsupplemental workplans to BJA and the National Council on Crime and Delinquencyat any time within 90 days of the completion of their current grants.

Shockincarceration is a relatively new alternative sanction which provides achoice between traditional prison incarceration and supervised, community-basedrelease, predominantly for the young, non-violent, first offender, age18-25, who was a short sentence. These programs operate under several names;``shock incarceration'' and ``boot camp'' are probably the most common.The specific components of these programs vary including activities suchas work, community service, education and counseling. Some programs requireintensive supervision upon release.However, one similarity among all programs is a highly structured, military-typeenvironment where offenders are required to participate in drills and physicaltraining, all of which is directed by staff in a military, or boot camp,atmosphere. The sentence lengths are usually shorter than traditional detentionand are seen by proponents as cost-effective means of reducing prison overcrowding.Proponents also argue that the short-term, demanding and rigorous bootcamp component of the programs will be rehabilitative and reduce recidivism.<T3>Program description:</T3> The criminal justice system's expanded effortsto apprehend and prosecute both the drug trafficker and drug user requiresthat new alternative sanctions be established. This program will demonstratethe integration of drug treatment components into shock incarceration programs,to provide an opportunity to test the feasibility and effectiveness ofexpanded offender treatment and counseling using a variety of drug treatmentmodalities for youthful drug and drug dependent offender.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> This is a competitive program.However, applications from existing shock incarceration-type programs toestablish or enhance drug-dependent offender treatment efforts will receivefunding priority.<T3>Award period:</T3> Grants will be for 12 months.<T3>Award amount:</T3> Two grants will be awarded for approximately $250,000,for a program total of $500,000.<T3>Due date:</T3> Applications should be submitted no later than March31, 1989.<T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isNicholas Demos, Chief, Corrections Branch, 202/272-4605.<T3>Program title:</T3> Correctional Industry Information Clearinghouse.<T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> To support improved operations and expansionsof state correctional industries, both as a means to reduce inmate idlenessand to develop revenues for a variety of correctional and social purposes.<T3>Background:</T3> This project provides publications, technical assistanceand special research for state prison industries. It is a continuationof a clearinghouse for state prison industries developed at the AmericanCorrectional Association (ACA) in 1986.<T3>Program description:</T3> ACA staff handle technical assistance requestson a wide-range of prison and jail industry issues, including legislation,personnel procedures, marketing and sales, and organization and management,as well as joint ventures with the private sector.

The goal is to increasepublic safety and accountability of probationers and parolees, especiallyfor offenders with addiction problems, through a rapid transfer process.<T3>Background: </T3>Current estimates are that we are approaching 100,000transfers of probationers and parolees between states each year. Thesetransfers are made under the terms of the Interstate Compact, which wasrecently revised to include automated transfers. An extensive survey ofthe states revealed that the current transfer process is slow, burdensomeand unwieldy, often leaving probationers and parolees without supervisionfor months. The National Institute of Corrections funded a project to revisethe Interstate Compact, and that has been completed.Six states with high volumes of transfers have volunteered to test andevaluate a computerized system of transfers. The six states are: California,New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and Texas. The project hasbeen carefully planned over the past two years by the Interstate CompactAssociation Information Network Committee with staff from the Council ofState Governments. Technical assistance was provided by SEARCH Group, Inc.<T3>Program description: </T3>The program will be conducted by the Probationand Parole Compact Administrators Association, with staff and financialmanagement by the Council of State Governments, the Secretariat for theAssociation. One of the objectives is to insure proper supervision of higherrisk drug/alcohol dependent offenders, and their entry into proper treatmentprograms. Six states are ready to test the automated transfer system. Afterthe evaluation other states may be added to the system.The Council of State Governments' MicroVAX computer facility in Lexington,Kentucky, will serve as the central ``Mailbox'' for the transfers. Datarecord exchange will be supplemented by fax machines. The ``Mailbox'' wouldbe accessed by the pilot states from dedicated personal computers and modemssecured through project funds and maintained at the states' expense.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>The project will be implementedby the Probation and Parole Compact Administrators Association, throughits Interstate Compact Association Information Network Committee. Staffand financial management will be provided by the Council of State Governments.<T3>Award period: </T3>This will be for 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $230,000 is earmarked for this project.<T3>Due date: </T3>An application is due from the Compact AdministratorsAssociation by January 15, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact person for additional informationis Nicholas Demos, Chief, Corrections Branch, 202/272-4605.<T3>Program title: </T3>Intensive Supervision for Drug Offenders (Probationand Parole) Training and Technical Assistance.Goals/objectives: To provide a minimum of eight intensive training institutesto states or jurisdictions that are ready to implement an intensive supervisionfor drug offenders project. Training institutes will be provided on planning,implementation strategies, and problem-solving. It is anticipated thatapproximately 16 jurisdictions will be reached through these training institutes.<T3>Background: </T3>Prison crowding is, and will continue to be, the mostpressing issue facing state correctional facilities. Intensive supervisionis one of the alternatives available to the corrections system to helpalleviate crowding. Intensive supervision, if properly implemented, canoffer some cost and bed saving respite for crowded institutions. Some jurisdictionscould benefit from intensive training that will provide assistance in theimplementation phases of program development.In fiscal years 1986-1988, BJA funded an Intensive Supervision DemonstrationProgram. This Program provided funding for 10 demonstration sites, nationaltechnical assistance, intensive training, and an independent evaluation.Six out of the 10 demonstration sites were specifically targeted to provideservices to drug offenders.The National Council on Crime and Delinquency (NCCD), in conjunction withRutgers University, has developed and utilized a very successful trainingand planning format for the BJA intensive supervision demonstration program.This basic format will be used for this new effort, and the experienceand expertise of NCCD and Rutgers will be brought together to implementthis program.<T3>Program description: </T3>This program has two components: (1) Theprovision of specialized intensive training seminars to provide managementand operational training focused on program development, planning, implementationstrategies, and problem-solving; and (2) the provision of a comprehensivetechnical assistance package that will provide on-site consultation toensure successful program operation. Projects must evidence a commitmentto emphasize urinalysis, treatment, and surveillance.This program will provide all training costs, travel, and per diem directlyrelated to attendance at the training sessions. No project-related costswill be paid out of this grant. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>Interested states or jurisdictionsmust meet four criteria prior to selection for participation in traininginstitutes: andbullet; Priority will be given to those states that are involved in thePrison Capacity or the Department of Corrections Drug Treatment StrategyPrograms. Other jurisdictions will be considered on a space available basis.Some weight will also be given to geographic distribution of interestedjurisdictions. andbullet; This training is for those jurisdictions ready to implement anIntensive Supervision project. It is expected that the Project Directorand approximately 3-4 additional staff members who will be working on thisprogram will take part in these training seminars. Applicants must showevidence that they will be ready to begin implementation of a program immediatelyafter the first training session. andbullet; All intensive supervision projects involved in this training musteither show evidence of an existing treatment component or a willingnessand funds to develop a treatment component. andbullet; States/jurisdictions must indicate a willingness to participatein both training institutes. Requests will be reviewed by NCCD and BJA, with final approval for siteselection made by BJA. The National Council on Crime and Delinquency, building upon their specializedexperience with BJA's 10 demonstration sites, will receive a grant to providetechnical assistance and training services. <T3>Award period: </T3>This program will extend for 12 months. <T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $150,000 has been earmarked for this nationaltraining and technical assistance grant. All training, travel and per diemcosts will be paid for selected sites via voucher submission to NCCD. <T3>Due date: </T3>Completed application from NCCD is due within 15 daysof the date of this announcement. <T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isKim C. Rendelson, Program Manager, Corrections Branch, 202/272-4605. Forthose jurisdictions interested in the training institute, please contactDoug Holien, NCCD, Director of Research, Technical Assistance and Programs,608/274-8882, to express interest and obtain a copy of eligibility criteria.<T3>Program title: </T3>Coordinated Interagency Drug Training and TechnicalAssistance. <T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To coordinate and enhance the parallel effortsof probation/parole officers and drug treatment practitioners through cross-training.To develop activities that will expand networks and improve community managementof the drug-dependent offender. <T3>Background: </T3>Coordinating services between the criminal justiceand treatment systems is a complex process. Each system tends to defineclient goals and the manner in which the goals are accomplished differently.Desired behavioral outcomes for the criminal justice system focus on recidivism,whereas the treatment system is more interested in treatment retentionand drug-free days. Drug dependent offenders require close community supervision. If such individualsare sentenced to probation or released from prison on parole without astrong monitoring component that promotes socially acceptable behaviorand provides treatment for drug dependency, public safety may be endangeredand judicial intent thwarted. Initiating comprehensive drug programs for offenders requires flexibilityin policy, strategy and technology. Cooperative planning by probation/parolesystems and drug treatment systems is essential to this process. An importantstep in cooperative planning is to share and in some cases consolidate,information and resources. Full case management programs for offenders, emphasizing reduced case loadsand combining strong monitoring, sanctions and community-based services,is certain to be a more effective intervention strategy than simply assumingthat a jail term will ``cure'' the deviant behavior and accompanying drugdependency. Highly structured, daily supervision for drug-dependent offenders is essentialto protect public safety. Frequent drug testing, random home visits andcollateral contacts with family and employers work in tandem with drugtreatment and employee assistance. In addition, a system of prompt positiveand negative sanctions work most effectively when probation/parole andtreatment work in a coordinated effort with the individual offender. Criminal justice and drug treatment agencies have traditionally had analmost adversarial relationship because of ``turf'' issues and a blurryline dividing roles and functions. Recognizing the potential pitfalls andworking to avoid them are two vital actions that are often overlooked.Cooperative interagency agreements, joint training, and efforts to clarifyroles and functions can significantly enhance the chances that both systems'goals will be reached. <T3>Program description: </T3>The Coordinated Interagency Drug Trainingand Technical Assistance Program, in its entirety, will develop and implementjoint training for both probation/parole officers and for treatment practitioners.Two national organizations representing the two fields will work together:The National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD)and the American Probation and Parole Association (APPA). Their cooperativeefforts will help garner support from their constituents and will ensurethat the project's approach, materials and use of language are appropriate.Training activities will be conducted under the auspices of a Justice/TreatmentCoalition composed of nationally-known experts and representatives fromboth organizations. The full project plan for the program includes: Determining the specificproblems and issues to be addressed and developing a curriculum which matchesthe joint needs of the two fields; conducting training of the trainerswho will teach the material; conducting 60 two-day seminars (at least onein each state) which train probation/parole and treatment personnel jointly;providing follow-up technical assistance as needed; evaluating a portionof the training 3 to 4 months later; and preparing and disseminating aProgram Brief outlining the training's critical elements and guiding principles.However, in FY 1989, BJA will fund only the following activities: Start-upand needs assessment, curriculum development and teacher training; pilottraining, site evaluation and analysis of impact; plan for completion ofprojects. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>This award will be made toNASADAD and the Council of State Governments, APPA based on a negotiatedcooperative agreement. <T3>Award period: </T3>The period of performance for the full project isestimated to be 24 months. However, BJA will fund only 12 months of activityduring FY 1989.<T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $500,000 is available for this award.<T3>Due date: </T3>Application for the cooperative agreement will be dueby February 15, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isJody Forman, Program Manager, Drug Abuse/Information Systems Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>BJA/Public Health Service Drug Treatment Intervention.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To develop a model substance abuse program thatwill incorporate the needs of the corrections system with the servicesof the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS). This program will provide substanceabuse diagnosis and treatment referral services to local and county jailinmates and offenders on Intensive Supervision by PHS community and migranthealth centers. A national conference of public and correctional healthcare providers will result from this effort.The objectives are to:andbullet; Provide a continuum of health care <T3>and </T3>substance abuse treatment to offenders, andandbullet; Foster the development of a network of criminal justice and healthcare agencies to better serve the substance abuse/treatment needs of jailinmates, probationers, and parolees.<T3>Background: </T3>Although some public health centers are providingdirect health services to correctional agencies, few are actually workingtogether. This program, therefore, presents a logical mechanism for integratingcommunity and correctional facilities interests in substance abuse andtreatment. Inmates, probationers and parolees return to their communitieswith untreated substance abuse problems which continue to cause medicalproblems for the individual as well as societal problems for the communityin general. Under an existing Interagency Agreement with PHS, it has beenmutually agreed to enter into a joint venture to develop a model substanceabuse/intervention program(s) within the correctional system.<T3>Program description: </T3>This program is divided into the followingtwo components:andbullet; <T3>Program Planning and Implementation: </T3>A number of host sites willbe identified by BJA and PHS, based on locations of existing local healthcenters and location of correctional facilities. Facilities will be contactedto determine interest. Public health and correctional officials will beworking together to plan and implement program goals, develop appropriatepolicies and procedures to integrate correctional needs with health careservices. A Program Manual/Guidebook will be developed.andbullet; <T3>National Conference: </T3>Based on documentation and expertise gleanedfrom program operation, a joint national conference on substance abusefor public health and correctional health care providers will be conductedin the latter portion of this program effort.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>An award will be made to CorrectionalResearch Institute, based on their existing working relationship with PHSand existing available consultant network established under a previousgrant. As the national program coordinator, Correctional Research Institutewill be responsible for:andbullet; A design for joint administrative oversight and provision of onsiteconsultation and information dissemination to assist in the developmentand implementation of selected sites;andbullet; A design for implementation of the joint national conference;and,andbullet; A design for joint evaluation which provides some impact assessment.<T3>Award period: </T3>This will be a 12 month effort.<T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $150,000 is earmarked for this program.<T3>Due date: </T3>The application from the Correctional Research Instituteis due no later than March 31, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isKim C.

Theemphasis of this program is on drug treatment in larger metropolitan jails,but training and clearinghouse services will be provided for smaller jailsas well.<T3>Background: </T3>In FY 1987, the American Jail Association (AJA) proposeda national research and demonstration program to assist jails and communitycorrections agencies in improving screening and treatment for drug offenders.In FY 1987, BJA funded two national models, and in FY 1988, funded oneadditional site. These projects are located in Pima County, AZ; HillsboroughCounty (Tampa), FL; and in Cook County (Chicago), IL.<T3>Program description: </T3>This program will be continued to providefor the following components:andbullet; Continuation funding of one existing pilot project at approximately$350,000. The model site will cooperate in the transfer of project componentsfrom the model jail to others jails through documentation and host visits.  andbullet; Transfer of project components from the other existing model jailsto other metropolitan jails through documentation and host visits; and,  andbullet; Continued research updates on success in reducing drug abuse andrecidivism rates through a combination of institutional and community treatment.  <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>For the pilot project to becontinued eligibility criteria include: Level of integration of jail andcommunity treatment components; comprehensiveness of the drug treatmentcomponent; strategy for aftercare; support from local correctional anddrug treatment officials; strategy for enlisting the cooperation of correctionsofficers and overcoming resistance to treatment programming; and localfunding sources committed to the project. Projects are strongly encouragedto combine block grant and discretionary funds to the extent possible.The American Jail Association will continue to be the National ProgramCoordinator for this program.  <T3>Award period: </T3>The new award will extend the project for 12 months. <T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $460,000 is earmarked for this program, tobe distributed as follows: $110,000 for a grant to the American Jail Associationfor administration, technical assistance, and the research component and$350,000 to continue one jail project.  <T3>Due date: </T3>Applications must be submitted to BJA by the AJA andby the site to be continued no later than February 1, 1989.  <T3>Program contact: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isKim C. Rendelson, Program Manager, Corrections Branch, 202/272-4605. <T3>Program title: </T3>Technical Assistance to Corrections Agencies. <T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To provide a range of site-specific technicalassistance and training in support of new block grant and non-block grantprojects in correctional institutions and in community corrections agencies;and to support BJA-initiated special projects.  <T3>Background: </T3>In FY 1987, BJA funded Corrections Research Institute(CRI) to provide a range of site-specific technical assistance and trainingefforts in support of new block grant and non-block grant projects in correctionalinstitutions and in community corrections agencies. This program was developedwith the recognition that state departments of corrections, local jails,and community corrections agencies would be implementing a wide range ofdrug screening, drug treatment, and rehabilitation projects with blockand non-block grant funds. It was recognized that many of these new orexpanded drug-related projects could have a significant impact on the operationsof corrections agencies, and that there would be a substantial need fortechnical assistance and training to support these projects. Six to eightregional training seminars on drug-related topics were scheduled, and inaddition, twenty-five of these grant funds were set aside for special projects. <T3>Program description: </T3>A supplemental grant will be awarded to CorrectionsResearch Institute to continue providing technical assistance and trainingactivities. It is projected that another six regional or State seminarswill be implemented on special topics related to drugs, such as specialhandling of drug dealers, eliminating drugs in the institution, model personneland job descriptions, and community supervision. It is also projected thatup to 60 additional on-site technical assistance assignments will be completed,covering drug treatment, organization, management, and screening instruments.  Implementation will continue to be delivered primarily on a broker basis,i.e., maximum use will be made of exprienced administrators, practioners,and consultants. Twenty-five percent of grant funds will again be earmarkedfor special projects at the direction of BJA.  <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>One national scope grant willbe awarded to Corrections Research Institute to continue their presentefforts. CRI must submit a Federal SF-424 application which must includea complete budget, efforts to be continued, up-to-date staff capabilities,up-to-date consultant capabilities, any changes in present operation. <T3>Award period: </T3>This award will be for 12 months.  <T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $250,000 is earmarked for this project.  <T3>Due date: </T3>An application is due at BJA no later than January 15,1989.  <T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isKim C. Rendelson, Program Manager, Corrections Branch, 202/272-4605.  <T3>Program title: </T3>Comprehensive State Department of Corrections TreatmentStrategies for Drug Abuse.  <T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To reduce recidivism rates of major drug usingoffenders by a range of drug treatment programs and community supervisionand treatment.  <T3>Background: </T3>This program was initiated in FY 1987 to assist statedepartments of corrections to expand and upgrade drug treatment and rehabilitationactivities in all state institutions. BJA selected Narcotic and Drug Research,Inc. (NDRI), as the national program coordinator to assist with technicalassistance and training. Six states were selected for Phase I Planningcontracts for the first year: Connecticut, New York, Delaware, Florida,Alabama, and New Mexico. All six states are now in the implementation phaseand four new states were added to Phase I in FY 1988: New Jersey, Oregon,Washington, and Hawaii.  <T3>Program description: </T3>The major objective is to develop a rangeof model state drug treatment activities including: Therapeutic communities,drug resource centers, drug education, and self-help groups that can beintegrated into existing and proposed institutions. An ancillary objectiveis to train corrections and treatment staffs in the latest techniques fordrug treatment. Lastly, the program has an evaluation objective, wherebyboth the treatment process and the impact will be assessed.  <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>No new Phase I planning stateswill be added to the program at this time. Only those states presentlyworking through their planning phases are eligible to submit applicationsfor the Implementation Phase. NDRI will receive a supplemental award tocontinue its technical assistance to participating sites. Site applicantsmust submit completed SF 424 applications to BJA upon completion of theircomprehensive plan. The current planning states should be ready for implementationprojects in the Spring or Summer of 1989.  <T3>Award period: </T3>All implementation grants will be for a 12 monthperiod. The NDRI supplemental award will be for an additional 12 months. <T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $1,800,000 is earmarked for this program tobe distributed as follows: $1,300,000 for implementation grants to thosestates that have completed Phase I with an approved plan by BJA and NDRIand $500,000 is set asisde for continuation of technical assistance andtraining through NDRI.<T3>References:</T3> Information packets on prison drug treatment programsare available from NDRI upon request.

These certifiedprojects represent prison industries operated at free-world standards andpaying prevailing wage rates under special legislation authorized by theCongress. The benefits received are the availability to sell prison-madegoods in interstate commerce and to federal agencies.  <T3>Background:</T3> 18 U.S.C. 1761 implements the Prison Industry EnhancementProgram originally authorized within the Justice System Improvement Actof 1979. The program provides exemption from Federal constraints on themarketability of non-Federal prison-made goods by permitting the sale ofthese products in interstate commerce and to the Federal Government. Upto 20 non-Federal prison industry projects may be certified for this exemptionwhen their operation has been determined by the Director of the Bureauof Justice Assistance to meet statutory and guideline requirements. Thecertified projects are designed to place inmates in a realistic workingand training environment enabling them to acquire marketable skills, thuspotentially increasing the possibilities for successful rehabilitationand the chances for meaningful employment upon release. Tensions are reducedin participating institutions as idleness decreases. Project workers alleviatesome of the costs of incarceration by contributing room and board and familysupport payment, and becoming taxpayers, and victims of crime are compensatedfor their loss.  <T3>Program description:</T3> This project will be a continuation of thepresent technical assistance and training cooperative agreement with theAmerican Correctional Association, to support the Private Sector/PrisonIndustry Enhancement Certification Program. The Program requires that stateand local units of government comply with the following legislative-mandatedconditions and administrative authority: Statutory authority to administerprison industry program; contributions to victims compensation or victimassistance programs; consultation with organized labor; consultation withlocal private industry; payment of prevailing wages; free worker displacement;voluntary participation; worker compensation; and private sector involvement. The cooperative agreement shall provide for the use of expert personnelfrom previously certified projects who have demonstrated skill in achievingadministrative, correctional and business objectives. These experiencedprison industry officials will help upgrade other project management systems,assist in resolving operational problems, and enhance communication andsharing among project participants. Depending on interest expressed bystate and local governments, up to 20 on-site technical assistance visitsare anticipated.  <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> This continuation award willbe made to the American Correctional Association as a cooperative agreement. <T3>Award period:</T3> The supplemental award will be for 12 months.  <T3>Award amount:</T3> Up to $265,000 is earmarked to supplement the Association'scurrent technical assistance and training project.  <T3>Due date:</T3> An application from the American Correctional Associationwill be due by February 28, 1989. <T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isLouise S.

The new DATOS study will measure the effectiveness of drugtreatment and investigate the treatment process. One measure of clientchange to be examined is criminal behavior. Data will be collected on anestimated 20,000 clients from approximately 32 different treatment programsin two one-year admission cohorts.BJA's participation in the initial phase of the project will help to ensurethat the questions and analyses for the criminal behavior factor addressthe interests of BJA and that special studies will examine specific factorssuch as the extent of criminal behavior when the Treatment Alternativeto Street Crime (TASC) program is involved in the treatment process.<T3>Program description: </T3>Under an Interagency Agreement, negotiatedwith the National Institute on Drug Abuse, BJA will provide support foradditional resources to the DATOS project to aid in the design of the criminalbehavior analyses and to specifically examine the extent of criminal behaviorwhen the TASC program is involved in the treatment process. Informationgathered through this effort will be made available to the states to guidestate and local criminal justice formula grant allocations for continuedtechnology transfer.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>An Interagency Agreement willbe negotiated with the National Institute on Drug Abuse.<T3>Award period: </T3>This award will be for a period of 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>One award will be made in the amount of $60,000.<T3>References: </T3>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Request for ProposalNo. 271-89-8233, ``Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study.''

The objectives are: (1) To support staff training forprison and jail projects participating in BJA demonstration programs; (2)to expand community drug treatment agencies that serve correctional populationsas rapidly as possible.<T3>Background: </T3>There is a growing commitment in correctional agenciesto provide improved drug treatment services, to break the drug/crime connection,and to reduce recidivism rates. The greatest impediment to this goal isthe lack of trained corrections and drug treatment staffs. The severe lackof substance abuse training resources within corrections and treatmentcommunities required a national drug treatment training institute. Tenstates are now participating in BJA's Corrections Drug Treatment Program,and within two years that number is expected to double. There is an equivalentsituation with metropolitan jails.<T3>Program description: </T3>A curriculum will be tested, refined, andamended as the project evolves. The Institute will include workshops andcourses, intensive therapeutic community training, regional training workshops,and internships at various sites throughout the country. Training willbe developed for corrections policy-makers, administrators, prison andjail line staffs, and community treatment staffs and aftercare supervisors.Approximately 350-500 personnel will be trained during the first year ofoperation. The project will develop manuals and related training materialsas necessary for use of the participants and for replication purposes.This project will allow for the testing and refinements of a national drugtreatment training curriculum, and lead into the national institute authorizedunder section 6292 of the 1988 Act, when funds are appropriated for thatpurpose.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>An interagency agreement willbe negotiated with the National Institute of Corrections (NIC), Bureauof Prisons.<T3>Award period: </T3>The project will be for a period of 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>Up to $300,000 has been earmarked for this project.<T3>Due dates: </T3>An interagency agreement date will be negotiated withNIC.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isNicholas Demos, Chief, Corrections Branch, 202/272-4605.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart VI_Information Systems</ITAG><T3>Program title: </T3>Operational Systems Support Technical Assistanceand Training.<T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> To enable state and local criminal justice agenciesto determine systems needs, establish systems requirements and design orprocure cost-effective, integrated information and management systems.<T3>Background:</T3> This project implements BJA's technical assistanceand training program, for state and local criminal justice agencies engagingin the necessary planning, organizational and analytical steps to implementoperational information systems and workload management systems. The benefitsof progress in information and management technology have not been universallyshared. Small to medium sized agencies, which make up the vast majorityof criminal justice agencies, often lack the resources to identify andemploy available technology. This program will be designed to reach theseagencies, directly and through their state and national organizations.Past technical assistance and training programs have included the conductof training sessions, the provision of documentary and on-site technicalassistance, the generation and dissemination of guidance documents, andthe generation and dissemination of generic systems. This program, especiallythe provision of on-site assistance, will function under strict priorities,with states lacking and in need of automation receiving priority attention.<T3>Program description:</T3> A cooperative agreement will be negotiatedwith SEARCH Group, Inc. A comprehensive plan for the progam will be submittedto BJA for approval. This plan shall recommend priority areas (and schedules)for training and other forms of technical assistance and support. The approvedplan and schedule will be published and will govern activities under thisprogram.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> The cooprative agreement willbe negotiated with SEARCH Group, Inc., in accordance with the priorityand guidance provided by the Congress.<T3>Award period:</T3> This award will be for 12 months.<T3>Award amount:</T3> The award will be up to $400,000.<T3>Due date:</T3> An application from SEARCH Group will be due to BJAwithin 15 days of the date of this announcement.<T3>Contact person:</T3> The BJA contact for additional information isJohn Gregrich, Chief, Drug Abuse/Information Systems Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title:</T3> National Criminal Justice computer Laboratoriesand Training Centers.<T3>Goals/objectives:</T3> To provide specific, practical assistance andtraining to state and local criminal justice agencies, in automating functions,in implementing available systems and in comparing technologies and selectingthe most cost-effective technology for local application.<T3>Background: </T3>This program provides support to the joint effortsof the Criminal Justice Statistics Association (CJSA) and SEARCH Group,Inc., in the conduct of the computer laboratories and training centers.This program is designed to respond to specific, information systems needsof criminal justice agencies. Most criminal justice agencies, and especiallysmall to medium-sized agencies, lack the necessary resources and expertiseto: Maintain information on available, public domain systems; investigatenew technologies; develop criminal justice applications for existing technology;compare available technology and select the most cost-effective hardwareand software for local systems; and provide necessary, technical trainingfor their employees, to meet local and national information requirements.Drawing upon the experience of the original laboratory and training center,operated by SEARCH Group, Inc. in Sacramento, CA, and the Washington DCfacility, operated jointly by CJSA and SEARCH, this program will providesupport for both facilities to purchase and operate essential equipmentand software and to receive and maintain equipment and software donatedby private vendors. The laboratories will house each center's publicationslibrary, the library of public domain and private sector software, andthe clearinghouse of computer vendors and users. They will provide sitesfor CJSA and SEARCH to assist users in the evaluation of software and hardware,and in the selection of appropriate products to meet their needs. Theywill also serve as sites for vendors to demonstrate their products to potentialusers and as sites for demonstrations of public domain software. The trainingcenters will continue to provide programs focused on: decision support;policy analysis; automation needs of criminal justice agencies; and, theoperation and use of public domain software, such as ``DA's Assistant''for prosecution management and ``Lock-up'' for jail management.<T3>Program description: </T3>A cooperative agreement(s) will be negotiatedwith the Criminal Justice Statistics Association and SEARCH Group, Inc.This program will provide for the continuing development and implementationof the National Computer Laboratories and Training Centers for the Easternand for the Western United States. More specifically, this program willfocus on: Demonstration of specific, operational micro-technology systems;the provision of specific training programs; the provision of specifictechnical assistance. A comprehensive plan for the program, addressingeach center, will be submitted to BJA for approval. This plan shall recommendpriority areas (and schedules) for training, systems demonstration, technologiescomparison and technical assistance. The approved plan and schedule willbe published and will govern the activities of each center.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>The cooperative agreement(s)will be negotiated with the Criminal Justice Statistics Association andSEARCH Group, Inc., the organizations jointly responsible for the conductof the computer laboratories and training centers. Eligibility is establishedin accordance with the priority and guidance provided by the Congress.<T3>Award period: </T3>This award will be for 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>The award(s), through cooperative agreement(s),will be negotiated to provide equivalent support for each laboratory andtraining center.

Criminal justice oversight, whichis essential to effective intervention and treatment for drug-dependentoffenders, must be continually and accurately informed of an offender'scompliance and progress with the case plan. With the growth in drug useby offenders and the consequent growth in drug law enforcement and criminaljustice case loads, reliable and timely information can continue only ifthe TASC program is automated.BJA-supported analysis by the National Consortium of TASC Programs (``BaselineManagement and Assessment Data_TASC'') has found that TASC programs systematicallycollect, use and report on a variety of case management information. However,the collection methods employed, the specific applications made and accessibility,or ``user friendliness,'' of these data systems vary widely among the morethan 116 programs in 24 States and one territory. Moreover, only one-quarterof the programs have automated their case management systems.As criminal justice case management programs continue to shoulder a largershare of community offender monitoring, the volume of data they collect,track and report on is also expanding. An efficient management informationsystem is essential to improve each program's management and operations.The cross program analysis essential to overall program improvement willbe possible only when basic data elements are collected in a similar mannerby all TASC programs. Other legitimate requests for TASC information arealso growing. These requests come from a range of local criminal justiceand substance abuse treatment agencies, local, state and national fundingagencies, from professional organizations, universities, and other interestedparties. Complying with mounting information requests is becoming progressivelymore difficult and time consuming.Finally, access to TASC and case management information will foster improvedcriminal justice planning on the state and national levels. State strategydevelopment for BJA block grant programs requires accurate and reliableinformation about criminal justice resources and unmet needs within a state.TASC programs must be in a better position to supply information when itcan be most useful to criminal justice planners.<T3>Program description:</T3> The intended result of this effort is a basic,micro technology system which can be thoroughly documented and placed inthe public domain and made available to the vast majority of TASC and casemanagement agencies, directly and through their state and national organizations.If possible, this will be accomplished by identifying and documenting operationalor emerging, transferable systems. Given the technical and organizationalcomplexity of this program, it will be accomplished in several stages.The first stage will be a fundamental needs assessment and requirementsanalysis based on a careful examination of TASC management requirementsand of information systems currently in use or under development. Thisstage will draw upon an Advisory Board composed of representative TASCprogram operators and others familiar with BJA/TASC program development.Crucial to the proper design and ultimate acceptability of a TASC managementinformation system is the active involvement of an Advisory Board whichreflects the current environment of TASC across the nation.The first stage will conclude with the presentation to BJA of a full reportof the state-of-the-art of automated case management systems, in a formdesignated by BJA, which gives criteria for a fully operational managementinformation system.The second stage, based on the results of the first stage, will be to actuallydevelop the management information system, demonstrate it and test it.Criteria for site selection and an implementation plan for selected siteswill be developed. An Advisory Board will also be involved in this stage.We anticipate making revisions and adaptations to the system as a resultof testing, culminating in specific software design. The second stage willconclude with a final documented and tested system with an accompanyingdissemination plan.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria:</T3> Drawing heavily on the adviceof field representatives and interested vendors, selection of the recipientof stage one of this cooperative agreement will be guided by the followingcriteria:andbullet; Ability to develop an organizational structure for implementingthe program;andbullet; Corporate capability and experience in management informationsystem development and software design;andbullet; Current working knowledge of the resources and limitations ofTASC and/or criminal justice case management programming;andbullet; Ability and experience in management information system documentation,training, and technical assistance; and,andbullet; Knowledge and experience in criminal justice assessment and evaluation.Based on the results of stage one, the stage two selection or competitionwill be separately announced.<T3>Award period:</T3> The entire project as described herein will extendno longer than 18 months.

It will draw upon recent, practicalexperience in transferring the JUSSIM model from Santa Clara County, CA,to local governments in Ohio, Florida and California. The project willmake specific enhancements to the system and make it more user-friendly,in response to the recent growth of interest by state and local governments.<T3>Program description: </T3>A supplement to an existing cooperative agreementwill be negotiated with The Center for Urban Analysis. A workplan and scheduleof deliverables will be submitted to BJA for approval. This plan shalladdress: Specific improvements in the use and application of JUSSIM, basedon recent transfer experience; documentation of the improvements made;demonstration of the methods to be used by state and local governmentsin acquiring the necessary data to utilize the model; demonstration ofthe use of the model to track the volume and cost of drug cases passingthrough the system. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>A supplemental cooperativeagreement will be negotiated with The Center for Urban Analysis. <T3>Award period: </T3>This award will be for 12 months. <T3>Award amount: </T3>The award amount will be up to $50,000. <T3>Due date: </T3>Application will be due within 15 days of the date ofthis announcement. <T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isJohn Gregrich, Chief, Drug Abuse/Information Ssytems Branch, 202/272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>State Law Enforcement Management Information Systems.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To assist and draw upon the experience of selectedstates actively involved in the design and implementation of informationand management systems for law enforcement, for the purpose of identifyingbasic systems for transfer and for additional development. <T3>Background: </T3>This project implements a BJA technical assistanceand training program, by providing modest support for states actively engagedin the implementation of basic operational information systems for stateand local law enforcement. The intent is to identify basic, micro technologysystems which can be thoroughly documented and placed in the public domainand made available to those small to medium sized agencies, which makeup the bast majority of criminal justice agencies, and which often lackthe resources to identify and employ appropriate technology. This programwill be designed to reach these agencies, directly and through their stateand national organizations, by documenting the experience of their peers.<T3>Program description: </T3>A cooperative agreement(s) will be negotiatedwith one or more states, to provide modest, additional support for major,ongoing, state-funded (through block or local resources) efforts to implementa basic public domain law enforcement management information system. BJAwill receive sufficient documentation to allow for system transfer andfor future system refinement and enhancement. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>Cooperative agreement(s) willbe negotiated with interested states which meet the following criteria:The system is already funded; the system is at a stage of planning anddevelopment which allows for demonstration that it is a basic system, amicro technology system, a system with clear potential for wide transfer,a public domain system, a thoroughly documented system. BJA will invite eligible states to negotiate cooperative agreements, notto exceed $50,000 each. The intention of BJA is to identify and providemodest support for emerging, transferable systems; and to determine thefeasibility of a major demonstration program in subsequent funding cycles.<T3>Award period: </T3>Award(s) will be for 12 months. <T3>Award amount: </T3>The total program amount is $80,000.

The program wasinitially based on extensive research conducted by the NIJ in two majorcities. This research was designed to determine the relative risk to thepublic resulting from pretrial release of drug using arrestees. One by-productof this effort was determining that drug use was much more prevalent thananticipated; over half of the arrestees at these two sites had used drugsjust prior to arrest. The DUF Program was initially established in ten cities to test the representativenessof those findings. By the end of its first year of operation, the programhad cumulative data from 12 sites confirming high prevalence levels amongthe arrestee population. At the end of its second year, 21 sites were operational,women and juvenile arrestees were being included in the sample populationsat some of the sites, and regional or other patterns had begun to emergeas to type of drug preferred, frequency of use, and route of administration.<T3>Program Description: </T3>An Interagency Agreement will be negotiatedwith the National Institute of Justice to support periodic urinalysis ofarrestees, in up to 25 sites, for the purpose of determining the prevalenceof drug use and the kinds of drugs being used. This will provide a broaderbase of information, by which to determine the rates and kinds of druguse in the nation as a whole, and by which to identify regional variations.NIJ will identify sites in addition to the 21 now participating, will testa representative sample of arrestees quarterly and will report on the findings.This effort is directly supportive of BJA efforts underway to documentand transfer the testing approach employed in Washington, DC, and willcontribute directly to the development of other testing efforts which area part of this discretionary program and which are envisioned in stateblock programs. Coordination with the Drug Enforcment Administration willcontinue in selecting sites and the substances to be tested. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>The Interagency Agreementwill transfer the funds to NIJ. <T3>Award Period: </T3>This award will be for 18 months. <T3>Award amount: </T3>One award, through Interagency Agreement, will benegotiated in the amount of $1,300,000. <T3>Due Date: </T3>The Interagency Agreement date will be negotiated withNIJ. <T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isJohn Gregrich, Chief, Drug Abuse/Information Systems Branch, (202) 272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>BJS Criminal Justice Drug Data Center Clearinghouse.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To provide direct assistance to local, stateand Federal anti-drug efforts, through the identification, collection andanalysis of drug-crime information necessary for strategic and tacticalplanning. <T3>Background: </T3>This program will continue BJA support of the clearinghouseeffort, to meet the need of the criminal justice system for credible, accessibleand directly useful data on drugs, the drug-crime relationship and theimplications, for criminal justice policy and programs, of the infusionof as growing number of drug-dependent offenders. While data are gatheredby a number of Federal agencies, they are seldom consolidated and madeavailable in a form directly useful to criminal justice agencies. The intenthere is to inform Federal and state drug efforts with a clear baselinefrom which to assess their impact. <T3>Program description: </T3>The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) hastaken the steps necessary to: develop a pointer system which will identifyexisting sources for drug information; collect drug information relevantto criminal justice, which is not now being collected; analyze and presentdrug information in a form directly useful to criminal justice policy makersand practitioners; and, to assess the quality of drug information available.This effort, the Data Center and Clearinghouse for drugs and Crime: Providesan ``800'' number for direct access; gathers and analyzes information beingcollected as part of the Federal drug effort, such as the strategies underdevelopment by the states; coordinates with other information gatheringefforts; and publishes appropriate documents, such as a drug version ofthe BJS Report to the Nation. The Center and Clearinghouse is a centralsource of data from diverse Federal, state, and local agencies as wellas from the private sector. <T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>The Interagency Agreementwill transfer the funds to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. <T3>Award period: </T3>This award will be for 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>One award, through Interagency Agreement, will bemade in the amount of $200,000.<T3>Due Date: </T3>The Interagency Agreement date will be negotiated withBJS.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isJohn Gregrich, Chief, Drug Abuse/Information Systems Branch, (202) 272-4601.<T3>Program title: </T3>Innovative Local Program Documentation: Dispositionand Management of the Drug-dependent Offender.<T3>Goals/objectives: </T3>To provide modest assistance to and to drawupon and document the experience of innovative local programs which havethe potential of contributing substantially to the existing body of knowledgeregarding the drug-dependent offender.<T3>Background: </T3>This project will provide modest support for programsactively serving the criminal justice system in the disposition and managementof the drug-dependent offender. BJA has actively supported TASC, as thecase management standard, and Intensive Supervision Probation as an appropriatedisposition for certain drug-dependent offenders. The intent here is notto duplicate or supplement those programs, for which critical elementsare established and for which block funding is available. Rather the intentof this effort is to identify established and effective local programsor functions which differ from, and can potentially contribute to, BJA-supportedprograms.Priority consideration will be given to effective programs which: Assistcriminal justice decision makers in the disposition of drug-dependent offenders;provide aftercare for drug-dependent offenders released from institutionalprograms; manage drug-dependent offenders facing extended waiting periodsfor treatment; provide credible evaluations of local treatment and/or casemanagement programs and/or, match drug-dependent offenders with availablelocal services.<T3>Program description: </T3>Cooperative agreements will be negotiatedwith selected operating programs to provide modest, additional supportfor ongoing efforts. BJA will receive sufficient information and documentation,in an agreed upon form, to allow for the contributions of these programsto be incorporated into the overall BJA program.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>Concept papers will be acceptedfrom public and private, non-profit programs. An expert panel will review,rank and rate the concept papers and make recommendations to BJA. The panelwill be guided by the priorities listed above, by the degree to which theconcept papers establish the effectiveness of the program addressed, andby the relative contribution to program knowledge anticipated from theprogram addressed. Cooperative agreements will be negotiated with selectedprograms.<T3>Award period: </T3>Awards will be for 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>The total program amount is $250,000. Individualawards will be for $50,000 or less.<T3>Due dates: </T3>Concept papers are due by January 31, 1989.

This review and anymodifications of the strategy should be based on an analysis of the impactof current efforts on the drug problem. A Consortium of States was establishedin early 1988 to serve as a forum for the states to work together to identifymethods of assessing the impact of their strategies and share information.Fifteen states are actively participating in the Consortium.<T3>Program description: </T3>BJA will negotiate a cooperative agreementwith the Criminal Justice Statistics Association (CJSA) to continue andexpand the Consortium efforts in up to 20 states to define methods of assessingthe impact of the state strategies, collect and analyze data on drug controlefforts in the states, and provide assistance to non-participating statesthrough a workshop on strategy evaluation. CJSA will prepare a report onthe methods used to assess the impact of the state strategies and the resultsof the analysis. The report will serve as a guide for states not participatingin the Consortium and the results will be incorporated in BJA's annualreport to Congress.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>The award will be made tothe Criminal Justice Statistics Association, on a non-competitive basis,due to the Association's unique qualifications and relationship with theStatistical Analysis Centers in the states.<T3>Award period: </T3>This award will be for a 12-month period.<T3>Award amount: </T3>One cooperative agreement of up to $600,000 willbe negotiated.<T3>Due date: </T3>The application for the cooperative agreement will bedue by January 15, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information inPatricia A.

To enhance the programby adding a new component which will assess interest in the accountabilityapproaches for youthful drug offenders and the feasibility of various optionsfor implementation; develop guidelines and program requirements; providetechnical assistance and support for the implementation of demonstrationprojects; and document the implementation process to facilitate evaluationand eventual replication of a program that makes youth accountable fordrug offenses.<T3>Background: </T3>Since 1986, BJA has funded the Pacific Institute forResearch and Evaluation (PIRE) to provide on-site and documentary trainingand technical assistance for judiciary and criminal justice personnel whoadminister and work with BJA-funded local programs that address the needsof serious juvenile offenders. This effort complements the work of theOffice of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) by meetingthe needs of BJA-funded programs addressing this issue.When this effort began, the number of projects requiring services was 19.During the years 1987-1988 that number grew to 42. These Serious JuvenileOffenders Programs have provided services which impacted 10,033 youth.PIRE has sponsored two National Conferences and several Mini Seminars andCluster Conferences which responded to the training needs of persons workingin restitution programs from almost every state in the United States. Thisprogram will continue providing training and technical assistance for newblock grantees and will implement a new component which will research anddocument guidelines and program administration requirements to be usedin programs which address accountability requirements of youth who aredrug dependent.<T3>Program description: </T3>The Program will continue on-site and documentarytechnical assistance and training for recipients of BJA block grants administeringprograms which address problems of serious juvenile offenders, based onthe critical program elements documented in the revised ``Restitution byJuveniles'' Program Brief prepared in 1988. As in the past, BJA block granteeswill also be eligible to recieve training and other benefits from the marketingefforts, training events, and other contacts provided through grants fromOJJDP. This program will continue to be coordinated with OJJDP.This initiative will be enhanced to provide a survey report assessing needsand interest in accountability approaches for youthful drug offenders andto develop an implementation guide (Program Brief) that includes programdesigns, critical program elements and performance standards for programswhich address accountability of drug-dependent youth. The project staffwill develop the plan for providing technical assistance and training forprograms/staffs that implement these approaches, and for selection of juvenilecourts interested in pilot or demonstration projects under Phase I. PhaseII, if funded, will provide for demonstration sites to implement projectsusing the documented critical program elements, guidelines, and performancestandards developed under Phase I.<T3>Eligibility and selection criteria: </T3>The BJA will negotiate a supplementalcooperative agreement with the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation.<T3>Award period: </T3>The extension will be for 12 months.<T3>Award amount: </T3>One cooperative agreement for up to $200,000 willbe awarded.<T3>Due date: </T3>The grantee must submit a full application not laterthan January 31, 1989.<T3>Contact person: </T3>The BJA contact for additional information isDorothy L.
