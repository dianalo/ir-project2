SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More Americans have high school diplomas andcollege degrees than ever before, reflecting a continuing emphasison education in society, a new Census Bureau study shows.   ``The entire post-Second World War era has been characterized byan expansion of educational opportunities and structures in thecountry,'' Census demographer Robert Kominski commented.   His new study of educational attainment found that, as of March1987, more than three-quarters of people aged 25 and over havecompleted high school and nearly one in five has finished at leastfour years of college.   Both shares have been increasing gradually over the years, saidKominski.   ``In the 1960s the civil rights movement added another level ofopportunity. And the expansion of college grant and aid programs inthe '60s and '70s allowed this to continue,'' he said.   Kominski added that changes in the age breakdown of thepopulation have also had an impact on education averages, as theless educated elderly are replaced by younger people who have spentmore time in school.   For example, people in their teens, with 80 percent to 90percent completing high school, are replacing older folks who wereraised at a time when completion of six to eight years of schoolingwas a major accomplishment, he explained.   Does this mean that Americans today are smarter than in the past?   ``Not necessarily,'' Kominski said. ``We all like to think thatwe were raised in the generation which produced the best and thebrightest.''   The study found that, overall, 75.6 percent of Americans havecompleted high school and 19.9 percent had finished four years ofcollege. That was up from 74.7 percent and 19.4 percent a yearearlier and 68.6 percent and 17.0 percent in 1980.   By comparison, in 1940 only 24.5 percent of Americans aged 25and older had completed high school and 4.6 percent were collegegraduates.   The 1987 report also noted that males were slightly more likelyto have finished high school than women, 76.0 percent to 75.3percent, a change from the early 1970s when women led in thiscategory.   The shift is largely attributed to increasing share of black menpursuing their educations, Kominski said.   In 1971, he pointed out, the last time women led men in overallshare of high school graduates, young black women aged 25 to 29 ledmen 60.7 percent to 54.1 percent in high school graduates. Lastyear among young blacks 84.8 percent of males and 82.1 percent ofwomen had finished high school.   Other findings for the population aged 25 and over included:   _ Whites had 77.0 percent high school graduates and 20.5 percentwho finished four years of college. The figures for blacks were63.4 percent and 10.7 percent. Other races, mostly Asians, had 78.4percent high school grads and 33.4 percent who finished college.   _ Hispanics recorded 50.9 percent who finished high school and8.6 percent with college degrees.   _ The West has the highest educational levels at 80.6 percenthigh school and 22.8 percent with college degrees. Figures forother regions were 76.5 percent and 22.2 percent in the East; 77.4percent and 17.6 percent in the Midwest, and 70.8 percent and 18.3percent in the South.   _ In metropolitan areas 77.6 percent had finished high schooland 22.1 percent college, compared to 68.7 percent and 12.6 percentin rural regions.   _ The highest rate of high school graduates was for people aged25 to 34 with 86.5 percent. That slipped to 85.9 percent in the 35to 44 group, 77.6 percent for those aged 45 to 54, and 67.8 percentfor people aged 55 to 64. Americans aged 65 to 74 included 56.9percent high school graduates, and over age 75 the rate was 42.0percent.   _ Those finishing college totaled 23.9 percent in the 25 to 34age group, then peaked at 26.5 percent among people aged 35 to 44.After that the rate declined, to 19.5 percent for those aged 45 to54, 14.9 percent for the 55 to 64 group, 10.6 percent for those 65to 74, and over 75 it was 8.9 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
