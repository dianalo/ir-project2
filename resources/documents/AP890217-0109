Army leader Gen. Michel Aoun, who also heads the ChristianCabinet in Lebanon's divided government, told a news conference:   ``We are responsible for the state, and they want a mini-state.... Those who do not abide by the law, I'll crush their heads.''   A cease-fire between the army and the Lebanese Forces militia wasreached Wednesday after fierce clashes earlier in the week aroundChristian east Beirut left 69 people dead and 197 wounded, accordingto police count.   The State Department says the U.S. Embassy in Beirut was beingcaught in the crossfire, and today some personnel were evacuated.   Defense officials in Washington, who requested anonymity, saidbetween 13 and 16 diplomatic workers were withdrawn on Army UH-60Blackhawk helicopters, leaving about 25 others still at work at theembassy.   The helicopters are based on Cyprus to provide logistical supportto the embassy because of the uncertainty of access to the war-tornnation.   Aoun said today he accepted the cease-fire mediated by theMaronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir and hopes efforts toreach a peaceful settlement will succeed.   ``Otherwise, it will be total destruction,'' he said. ``This timeit will be apocalypse,'' he said at his heavily-guarded headquartersin the Yarze suburb, east of Beirut.   Aoun demanded the rival Christian force withdraw from east Beirutand accused it of starting this week's fighting. The battles havedeepened divisions in the Christian community in this nation alreadyrent by years of civil war between Christians and Moslems, whocontrol a rival government.   The army commander said his forces thwarted an attack by theLebanese Forces on his home in a wealthy section of east Beirut onWednesday. He was away in Yarze at the time.   During the battles this week, Aoun's army captured militiapositions in Lebanon's central mountains. It also broke through somemilitia strongholds in east Beirut, but the militia remained in mostresidential districts here.</TEXT></DOC>
