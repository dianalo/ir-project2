Administration and Fed officials hope this week's small tightening in credit policy to counter domestic fears about inflation won't set off an international interest-rate spiral. U.S. officials oppose any German rate increase, partly because it could undermine the dollar. World-wide rate increases could also worsen the Third World debt problem.    Some economists say inflationary pressures could continue to push up U.S. interest rates this year. If so, foreign central banks may see that as an opportunity to tighten and to address their own inflation worries, despite U.S. concern. One fear, says Irving Trust economist Robert McGee, is that higher global rates &quot;will send the financial markets into a tailspin.&quot;    Fed member Angell says he doesn't see any need now for &quot;drastic action&quot; to tighten credit further.    REAGANITES FRET Central American allies might make a deal with Nicaragua.    U.S. officials hear talk of a possible &quot;friendship agreement&quot; including Nicaragua at a meeting of Central American foreign ministers this month. The agreement could produce a regional border commission to monitor and try to restrict border crossings as a way to minimize instability. Pressures will grow if cease-fire talks between Nicaragua and the Contra rebels collapse.    Honduras is nervous that the influx of Contras there will swell further if the talks fail. More than 70,000 Nicaraguans already are in Honduras. Their food supplies are dwindling, and Hondurans fear violence. A U.S. official says one reason behind an administration plan to distribute Nicaraguan currency to the Contras is to entice them back to Nicaragua.    BUSH'S VEEP: Howard Baker is pushed, but events may dictate the choice.    Some Bush strategists think the White House chief of staff and former Tennessee senator would enhance the ticket's stature and help in the South. Baker concedes the vice presidency would be hard to spurn. But he still resents Bush campaign chief Atwater, who accused him of aiding Dole. Baker's friends worry the No. 2 job would leave him &quot;bored to death.&quot;    The Bush camp will wait to see what the Democrats do. If Dukakis takes a big lead, Bush might go for a bold choice, such as Supreme Court Justice O'Connor. If Bush is ahead, he may pick someone comfortable, such as Wyoming Sen. Simpson. Should an industrial-state running mate be needed, Bush pollster Teeter would lean to former Pennsylvania Gov. Thornburg over Illinois Gov. Thompson.    &quot;We're letting a thousand flowers bloom,&quot; says a Bush adviser.    THRIFT WOES worsen as interest rates go up. A one percentage-point rise would send 20% of the profitable savings institutions into the red, one industry economist estimates. Analysts already expect 1988 industry losses to top last year's record $6.8 billion. Says one economist: &quot;I called last year abysmal. I'm running out of adjectives.&quot;    JAPAN SEEKS to settle import disputes with the U.S. before a June 19 trade summit in Toronto. Prime Minister Takeshita moves to work out a timetable for scrapping Japanese import quotas on beef and citrus. In exchange, he may ask Reagan to end U.S. sanctions imposed on Japan for breaching a semiconductor trade accord.    SIGN WARS: After the Democratic National Committee hangs out a sign about giving notice of plant closings (&quot;60 Days. It's Only Fair&quot;), the American Conservative Union down the street counters with its own sign: &quot;You want long-term notification of plant closings? Okay, if Mike Dukakis is elected president, a lot of plants are going to close.&quot;    SPEEDY REVIEW of new federal criminal sentencing rules will be sought by the Reagan administration and by lawyers for a defendant sentenced for cocaine distribution in Kansas City. With federal courts split on the rules' constitutionality, both sides want the Supreme Court to clear up the issue.    RUDER FACES new threats to his influence as SEC chairman.    Next month's departure of Commissioner Peters, who often votes with Ruder for modest market intervention, may cause 2-2 deadlocks. Her exit could even swing policy toward the free-market views of members Grundfest and Fleischman, if Commissioner Cox joins them.    One possible result: The SEC is more likely to take a hands-off approach to post-market-crash proposals, such as restricting program trading. The fifth SEC seat probably will remain vacant. Though Ruder is a Reagan appointee, the administration is loath to nominate anyone who backs his view, and Senate Democrats won't approve anyone who doesn't.    Little change is expected in SEC enforcement actions against insider trading and other stock abuses.    MINOR MEMOS: Donald Regan, asked about administration legislative plans, replies: &quot;Obviously, I haven't been in touch with this administration since {my} book came out. Obviously, I'm not going to be.&quot; . . . In preparation for the summit, Reagan took to Camp David a public-television documentary on changes a U.S. journalist found when he returned to the Soviet Union last year. . . . Aides to Sen. Simon irreverently refer to his afternoon reception for the South African Archbishop as &quot;Tea for Tutu.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
