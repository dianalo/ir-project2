To Establish Fund/Serv</ITAG>On October 21, 1987, the Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC'') filed aproposed rule change (File No. SR-MCC-87-05), described below, pursuantto section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``the Act'')\1\<NOTE/> to establish facilities to allow MCC members to use NSCC'sMutual Fund Settlement, Entry, and Registration Verification Service or``Fund/Serv''. On March 21, 1988, the Commission published notice of thisproposed rule change in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>to solicit comments from interested persons.\2\<NOTE/> On June 14, 1988, MCC filed a second proposed rule change(File No. SR-MCC-88-07), also described below, pursuant to section 19(b)(1)of the Act to establish participants' fund requirements for Fund/Serv users,to establish Fund/Serv procedures, and to clarify that MCC participantsmay exchange Fund/Serv data directly with MCC's Fund/Serv facilities manager.On September 8, 1988, the Commission published notice of the second proposedrule change in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>to solicit comments from interested persons.\3\<NOTE/> To date no comments have been received on either filing.As discussed below, this Order approves both proposals on a temporary basisthrough January 31, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25497 (March 21, 1988),53 FR 10027.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26067 (September 8, 1988),53 FR 35944.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Description</ITAG>The proposal amends MCC's rules to establish Fund/Serv and to authorizeMCC to promulgate procedures to implement that service. Fund/Serv willenable MCC participants to transmit mutual fund purchase and sale transactions,confirmations, settlement and registration data to mutual fund participants.\4\<NOTE/> The National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') willact as MCC's facilities manager for Fund/Serv.\5\<NOTE/> In its role as facilities manager, NSCC will receive Fund/Servdata directly from MCC participants and will retransmit that data to theappropriate mutual fund. MCC participants, however, will settle Fund/Servtransactions at MCC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ At this time, MCC will not offer Fund/Serv services tomutual fund processing agents. Thus, all mutual fund participants in Fund/Servare NSCC Fund members.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ NSCC received permanent approval to operate its Fund/Servservice in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-25146 (November 20, 1987),52 FR 45418.An MCC participant who wishes to use Fund/Serv must notify MCC of its intentionand provide its Fund/Serv clearing fund contribution to MCC.\6\<NOTE/> MCC will obtain from NSCC a Fund/Serv account number forthe participant and a date when the participant may access the service.After the MCC participant meet these requirements, it will be able to transmittrade information directly to NSCC for retransmission to any mutual fundthat is a Fund/Serv participant.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Although MCC's proposal creates a new category of membership,Fund/Serv-only participants, MCC has no immediate plans to admit any Fund/Serv-onlymembers. It is the Commission's understanding, however, that MCC will submitappropriate membership standards to the Commission as a proposed rule changeprior to admitting any Fund/Serv-only members.The proposal will require Fund/Serv broker-dealers to submit trade informationto MCC's facilities manager, NSCC, by 7:00 p.m. on the day of the trade(``T'').\7\<NOTE/> NSCC will forward all acceptable trades to the mutual fund.Mutual funds will submit confirmations and rejections of orders to NSCCby 11:00 a.m. on T+1. NSCC will acknowledge receipt of this informationto the mutual fund and will forward such information to MCC's participants.NSCC also will notify the mutual funds and the broker-dealers of orderswhich are neither confirmed nor rejected. Broker-dealers may submit correctionsconcerning the money values of trades or concerning the number of shareson either T+1 or T+2. Mutual funds will have until T+2 to confirm ordersnot previously confirmed and may make price changes in orders confirmedon T+1. Purchases and redemptions not involing physical shares will settleon T+5. For redemptions involving physical shares, the mutual fund, onceit has received the physical share certificates, will submit a releaseto settlement. Upon receipt of the release to settlement, Fund/Serv willsettle the transaction on the day following the receipt of the release.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Broker-dealers may submit trades, on an exception basis,until 11:00 p.m. if operational or communication difficulties prevent timelydata entry. According to NSCC, however, no Fund/Serv participant has eversubmitted information this late because broker-dealers want to submit theirorders before the end of the mutual funds' processing day. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ A mutual fund can not complete redemptions involving physicalshares until it receives the share certificates related to the transactionssubmitted with proper endorsements and guarantees. Therefore the transactioninformation is retained in the system, but settlement is delayed untilthe mutual fund receives those physical share certificates.On the evening of T+4, NSCC will provide mutual funds, broker-dealers,and MCC with a settlement summary listing transactions that are due tosettle the following day. MCC will use this settlement summary to preparean adjustment report which lists each participant's Fund/Serv debits andcredits and to determine whether a Fund/Serv member is in a net pay orcollect position. MCC will combine each participant's Fund/Serv net payor collect figure with its other MCC obligations to obtain each participant'stotal net pay or collect figure. Participants will pay MCC approximatelyone hour after MCC notifies them of a ``pay'' settlement figure, at about3:00 p.m. on settlement day in next-day funds. MCC pays its participantsat approximately 3:00-3:30 p.m. on settlement day in next-day funds.\9\<NOTE/> NSCC and MCC will settle their obligations with each otheron T+6 in federal funds, which are immediately available.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ NSCC pays its mutual fund participants by 1:30 p.m. NSCCpays its broker-dealer participants located in New York between 4:00 and7:00 p.m. and pays its broker-dealer participants located outside New Yorkbetween 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.As with NSCC's Fund/Serv, MCC's Fund/Serv is not a guaranteed service.If an MCC participant defaulted on its Fund/Serv payment obligations beforeNSCC has paid its participants, MCC will notify NSCC of the default soNSCC could stop payments to affected mutual funds and reverse transactionssettled on behalf of the defaulting MCC participant. If NSCC receives notificationof the default after it has paid its participants, NSCC could stop paymenton those funds (NSCC pays its participants in next-day funds) or, if NSCCis unable to stop payment, it could charge the affected participants thenext day. If NSCC is unable to collect the funds it paid on behalf of thedefaulting MCC participant, NSCC may declare those mutual fund participantsto be in default and may use their clearing fund deposits or liquidateany open contractual commitments on their behalf. If MCC fails to notifyNSCC by 10:00 a.m. on settlement day\1\\0\<NOTE/> and NSCC suffers a loss or liability as a result of the MCCparticipant default, MCC will indemnify NSCC. MCD will fund its obligationto NSCC first from the defaulting participant's MCC Fund/Serv clearingfund contribution, and then from that participant's contribution to thegeneral MCC clearing fund. If MCC still has not satisfied the loss, thenMCC will allocate that loss, <T3>pro-rata,</T3> among MCC participants using Fund/Serv. If the lossremains unsatisfied then MCC would follow its loss recovery rules and procedures.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ The MCC-NSCC Mutual Fund Settlement, Entry and RegistrationVerification Linkage Agreement states that it MCC notifies NSCC by 10:00a.m. (E.S.T.) on settlement day that it has ceased to act for an MCC participantthat MCC's liability shall be limited to the portion of the defaultingFund member's clearing fund contribution attributable to Fund/Serv. IfMCC notifies NSCC later than 10:00 a.m. (E.S.T.) on settlement day, andNSCC can not reverse the transaction MCC shall pay NSCC all amounts dueresulting from the defaulting participant's Fund/Serv use.If a mutual fund participant defaults on payment obligations arising fromtransactions with MCC participants, NSCC would inform MCC so that MCC wouldreverse any settlement credits to MCC participants because of transactionsdue to settle with the defaulting mutual fund.\1\\1\<NOTE/> If MCC receives notice of the default after it has paid itsparticipants, it could stop payment of those checks (like NSCC, MCC paysits participants in next-day funds) or it could charge its participantsfor the amount of the transactions the next day. If MCC cannot collectthe funds recharged to its participants, MCC may declare those participantsto be in default and may use their clearing fund deposit or liquidate theirsecurities which MCC has in its possession.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ As noted above, Fund/Serv payment obligations are notguaranteed by MCC or NSCC. According, if a mutual fund defaulted on paymentobligations to NSCC, MCC can refuse to pay its affected members.MCC has established a Fund/Serv clearing fund contribution requirementto cover potential Fund/Serv risks. The amount of a participant's clearingfund contribution is based on the settlement debits that a participantmay have with any one eligible mutual fund. If the participant's Fund-Servdebits with each mutual fund are less than $100,000, then the participantmust contribute $5,000 to the Fund/Serv clearing fund; if the participant'sFund/Serv debits with each mutual fund are less than $500,000, then theparticipant must contribute $10,000 to the Fund/Serv clearing fund; andif the participant's Fund/Serv debits with any one mutual fund are greaterthan $500,000, then the participant must contribute $20,000 to the Fund-Servclearing fund. If on any given day a MCC participant's Fund/Serv debitsfor any one mutual fund exceed the point at which a higher clearing fundcontribution is required, that participant must increase his contributionlevel accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. MCC's Rationale</ITAG>MCC believes the proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act becauseit promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of mutualfund transactions by providing its members with a standardized method ofcommunicating trade information to mutual funds. MCC believes that Fund/Serv'sautomated processing system is more efficient than the current methodsused by its participants. MCC also believes that it has established appropriaterisk management procedures, such as monitoring participants' activity,requiring additional clearing fund contributions when necessary, and limitingparticipants' activity, to protect itself from the potential risks associatedwith Fund/Serv activity.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposal is consistent withsection 17A of the Act because it will facilitate the prompt and accurateclearance and settlement of mutual fund transactions. MCC plans to offerFund/Serv through the Fund/Serv facilities at NSCC.\1\\2\<NOTE/> MCC's Fund/Serv is designed to extend to MCC participantsthe benefits of a centralized automated processing system for mutual fundpurchases and redemptions. This service facilitates the prompt and accurateclearance and settlement of mutual fund transactions by allowing mutualfund purchase and redemption information to be submitted in one standardizedformat to one central location, instead of submitting such informationin different formats to each mutual fund.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ NSCC received permanent approval to operate its Fund/Servservice in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-25146 (November 20, 1987),52 FR 45418 (November 27, 1987).MCC's proposed clearing fund requirement for Fund/Serv is based upon anindividual member's activity lever in Fund/Serv and upon the fact thatFund/Serv is not a guaranteed service. MCC's clearing fund requirementsare the same as NSCC's clearing fund requirements for Fund/Serv participants.\1\\3\<NOTE/> Specifically, the clearing fund deposits are designed toprotect MCC from risk associated with Fund/Serv, including the risk ofsimultaneous defaults by a MCC participant and a NSCC mutual fund participant.NSCC can withhold payment and reverse any transactions to its mutual fundsmade by the defaulting MCC particpant if it receives notice of a defaultfrom MCC by 3:00 p.m., the time NSCC pays its Fund/Serv participants. From3:00 p.m. until approximately 8:00 a.m. the next day, NSCC could placea stop payment on any funds paid to any mutual fund as a result of transactionby a MCC defaulting participant. Once NSCC participants have received theirfunds, NSCC could charge those mutual funds that received payment on transactionby defaulting MCC participants and, absent a default of a NSCC mutual fundparticipant, should be able to recover such funds. Obviously, MCC mustnotify NSCC as early as possible of a MCC participant's default in orderfor NSCC and MCC to avoid or minimize their potential financial exposure.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ NSCC's Fund/Serv clearing fund requirements were approveon a temporary basis until November 30, 1988. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 25290 (January 26, 1988),53 FR 3101, 25861 (June 28, 1988), 53 FR 28486, 26146 (September 30, 1988)53 FR 39565.The Commission is approving MCC's proposal for approximately three monthsin order to permit MCC, NSCC and Commission staff to evaluate the systemand financial safeguards and the adequacy of operational arrangements relatedto this service. Thus, the Commission expects MCC to monitor member Fund/Servsettlement activity, and report on activity levels and any problems encounteredduring the temporary approval period. Specifically, the Commission directsMCC to report any decision to suspend an MCC member's payment obligations,the dollar amount of suspended obligations, when those obligations werepaid, the amount of funds in the particpant's clearing fund, and whetherMCC sustained any losses as a result of any late payments of defaults.NSCC has developed and operated Fund/Serv since the pilot program beganin February 1986, with no significant operational problems.\1\\4\<NOTE/> Extending the benefits of Fund/Serv to MCC participants willhelp achieve the Act's goal to facilitate the establishment of a safe,efficient, and equitable national clearance and settlement system for mutualfund transactions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22928 (February20, 1986), 51 FR 6945.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
