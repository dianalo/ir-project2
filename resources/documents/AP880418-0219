Defending attacks on Iranian military platforms in the southerngulf, Reagan said: ``We aim to deter further Iranian aggression,not provoke it.'' He renewed the U.S. call for Iran to accept aUnited Nations resolution demanding a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraqwar.   Reagan used an appearance before a business audience to commenton U.S. reprisals for the mining of the frigate USS Samuel B.Roberts. His use of force won bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.   ``I have something in the nature of a bulletin for you,'' hetold representatives of the Associated General Contractorsorganization in the Old Executive Office Building auditorium.   ``Earlier today, our Navy made a measured response to Iran'slatest use of military force against U.S. ships in internationalwaters as well as its continued military and terrorist attacksagainst a number of nonbelligerents,'' Reagan said.   ``We've taken this action to make certain the Iranians have noillusions about the cost of irresponsible behavior,'' Reagan said.   ``They must know that we will protect our ships, and if theythreaten us, they'll pay a price,'' Reagan said. The president toldhis audience that ``a more normal relationship with Iran isdesirable _ and we're prepared for it.''   But Reagan said that ``such a relationship is not possible solong as Iran attacks neutral ships, threatens its neighbors,supports terrorism and refuses to end the bloody war with Iraq.''   Besides destroying the two offshore Iranian oil platforms usedfor military purposes, the U.S. Navy either sank or damaged foursmall Iranian gunboats and bombed two Iranian navy frigates thathad fired missiles at U.S. planes. Iran attacked oil facilities offSharjah and fired on at least two U.S. vessels.   No American injuries or fatalities were reported, but DefenseSecretary Frank C. Carlucci said a Cobra attack helicopter with twocrewmen aboard was late in returning to a Navy cruiser and that asearch had been mounted for the aircraft.   The Pentagon said the helicopter had been on a routinesurveillance mission from the cruiser Wainwright in the lowercentral gulf, and that there was no indication the aircraft hadbecome involved in hostile action.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, in a dispatchMonday night, said Iranian warships ``in a heroic clash with theaggressor American helicopters in the Persian Gulf shot down one ofthem Monday afternoon.''   Pentagon spokesman Maj. Bill O'Connell said Monday night thatthe Pentagon was aware of the Iranian claim but said, ``We havenothing on that. The search is still under way.''   Carlucci described as ``foolhardy behavior'' Iran's decision toescalate the fighting. He said he assumed the attacks could only beexplained as stemming from fanaticism.   Carlucci said three of the small Iranian craft were attacked bya Navy A-6 Intruder jet after observing them attack commercialvessels and oil rigs off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.   That confrontation occurred around 7:30 a.m. EDT, Carlucci said,or about 6{ hours after U.S. forces attacked the Iranian offshoreplatforms.   Navy jets were assigned to patrol the area after reports werereceived indicating an American commercial boat, the Willi Tide,had been attacked, Carlucci said.   Asked if he were surprised by the Iranian decision to confrontU.S. forces directly, the secretary replied: ``I wouldn't use theword surprised because the Iranians have been known to engage inthis kind of, frankly, foolhardy behavior before.''   The National Association of Arab Americans said in Washingtonthat it regretted the rising violence in the gulf, but that theU.S. military response was ``appropriate in light of our vitalsecurity interests and Iran's continued belligerence.''   ``The stakes are very high, and the U.S. cannot permit Iran toimpede the free flow of oil in the gulf,'' association presidentGeorge Moses said in a statement.   There were no immediate indications of American or Iraniancasualties from Monday's fighting.   The incident was the second such outbreak of violence since theUnited States began escorting oil tankers through the gulf lastJuly to protect them from attack from the warring parties in the7{-year Iran-Iraq war.   On Oct. 19, a raid was staged in retaliation to a missile attackon a Kuwaiti ship flying the U.S. flag in which 18 Americans wereinjured. Two Iranian oil platforms were destroyed in what Reagan atthe time termed a ``prudent'' response.   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said Mondaythat the United States sent a message to Iran warning that any``further provocation or hostile Iranian military or terroristaction against U.S. personnel or targets will receive a firm U.S.response.''   The message said the mine explosion that damaged the Roberts hadfollowed repeated warnings by the United States to Iran about theconsquences of placing mines in international waters of the PersianGulf.   Redman said that before Monday's retaliatory action, the UnitedStates had notified Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands andBelgium of its intentions. All have naval vessels in the gulf.Others, including the Soviet Union, were notified at the time theaction commenced, he said.   Democratic and Republican congressional leaders said they feltReagan's actions were fully justified. Several said they werepleased that Reagan consulted with them on Sunday night beforeacting.   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said: ``TheIranians were carrying out terrorist acts. ... I support thedecision to destroy the (Iranian oil drilling) platforms.''   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he hoped thatIran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, ``getsthat message so we can all avoid further bloodshed and violence.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, talking to reporters inthe early morning hours, had said Reagan acted only after theUnited States gathered ``conclusive evidence'' that Iran wasresponsible for the mining of the Roberts.   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said the White Housediscussions were ``very frank'' and that the congressional leaderspointed out the perils as well as the possible benefits of militaryaction.   But Wright said of Reagan: ``He is the commander in chief andwhen action is taken by the United States, it certainly behoovesall of us to close ranks and to give the world a view of a nationthat is united.''   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson voiced criticismof the operation, however, telling reporters in New York that thefighting with Iran raised fresh questions about U.S. policy in theregion.</TEXT></DOC>
