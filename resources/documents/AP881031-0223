Arturo Rivera Damas, Roman Catholic archbishop of San Salvador,said the proposal was based on observations about the political,social, military and economic situation from more than 60Salvadoran organizations.   Rebel leader Joaquin Villalobos said the Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front, the umbrella organization for fiveSalvadoran guerrilla groups, considered the report positive becauseit demands ``an end to the war and the reasons that led to it.''   He and rebel representative Leonel Gonzalez added, however, thatreopening talks with the government would be difficult.   Rivera Damas presented the report on what he called a ``nationaldebate'' during a ceremony at a military installation attended byGen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's military commander and defacto ruler.   Villalobos and Gonzalez met with Noriega and later said theybriefed him on visits by rebel representatives to Peru, Argentina,Ecuador and Costa Rica to promote a negotiated settlement.   They said rebel officials would return to those countries toinform the government leaders of their meeting with the archbishop.   Rivera Damas said the report contained 140 ideas offered by the60 organizations in several days of meetings with church leaders,but he gave no details.   Salvadoran church leaders have mediated the few meetings betweenthe government and rebels, and frequently urge that talks resume.The last meeting was Oct. 20, 1987 in San Salvador, the capital ofEl Salvador.   Gonzalez said the report ``can reactivate the peace process,''but another round of talks with the government of President JoseNapoleon Duarte ``isn't easy now.''   ``Negotiations in El Salvador are quite complicated,'' Gonzalezsaid. ``The Americans oppose them, Duarte opposes them, parts ofthe private sector oppose them so we have to build relations amongforces to open negotiations.''   He said the rebels have set no preconditions for talks butrejected previous government demands that the rebels lay down theirweapons.   ``We have given them the message that we are ready to talk withall social forces, including the army, that we are ready to talk atany place or time,'' Gonzalez said.   ``The one that's established conditions is the government,'' hesaid. ``Duarte has said that in order to talk again with the FMLN(rebels' front) we have to put down our arms. This is absurd, it'sinadmissible.''   Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, said Monday thatSalvadoran rebels had killed the mayor of a small town in Morazan,a western province in the war zone. The army said 53 rebels and 29soldiers were killed in several skirmishes in October.</TEXT></DOC>
