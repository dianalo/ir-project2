 The latestevidence is found in a dramatically improved version of Illustrator and asubstantially faster version of ATM.andM;Illustrator 3.andP;  The new version of Illustrator is an impressive piece of workin its own right.andP;  But even more important may be its underlying datastructure, which may represent the first step towards a defacto editablePost-Script data format.andM;Here is a brief summary of the salient new features:andM;*  Text tools.andP;  The most dramatic improvement in the new Illustrator is thehandling of type.andP;  Illustrator used to be a drawing program with limitedfacilities for creating and placing small text blocks.andP;  The new programcontains impressive facilities for all kinds of typographic effects.andM;The old convention of typing a maximum of 256 characters into a text dialogbox has been scrapped.andP;  Now, you type directly onto the screen any amount oftext in the typeface and point size you specify.andP;  Text may be flowed along anarbitrarily curved baseline (and slid interactively left and right along thecurve), sheared, rotated to any angle, scaled, expanded or condensed to anysize.andP;  Type may even be distorted, sheared and angled; it may always beedited directly on the screen.andM;Automatic kerning (using the values supplied with the fonts) and manualkerning are invoked at will.andP;  The program does not yet support hyphenation.andO;It does not flow copy from one column to the next, nor does it provide suchaids as a spelling checker.andP;  Nevertheless, we expect that Illustrator 3.0will become a very popular tool for creating advertisements, flyers and allkinds of graphically rich, single-page documents.andM;* Type as graphics.andP;  In the new release, you can also turn any Type 1 textinto editable PostScript Bezier outlines.andP;  This means that you can alter orextend character outlines at will to create logotypes and other specialeffects.andP;  It also means that you can use character or text outlines asgraphic elements.andP;  You can fill them with any pattern or image, use them as aclipping region, or turn them into an abstract graphic.andM;This capability was previously available in third-party packages, such asAltsys's Metamorphosis.andP;  Now, it is included inside Illustrator.andM;* Charting and graphng.andP;  The next most popular addition will probably be thecharting and graphing facilities.andP;  Illustrator 3.0 creates charts or graphsfrom numeric data entered in table form.andP;  This can be entered directly fromwithin Illustrator 3.0 or imported from a spreadsheet.andM;Any object may be used to create a graph.andP;  So, for example, bars thatrepresent housing starts could actually be drawings of houses.andP;  The chart orgraph remains a fully editable Illustrator file, so you can dress it up inwhatever fashion you please.andP;  And, of course, you can use the text toolsmentioned above to add whatever text you think appropriate.andM;* Image import.andP;  PostScript images can be imported and used in a variety offashions: as pattern fills, as background images, etc.andM;* Cleamer interface.andP;  The user interface has also been improved.andP;  From thebrief exposure we have had thus far, it looks as if the user interface fordrawing functions has also been simplified and improved to be somewhat moreintuitive.andP;  We will have a better feel for this after we have used theprogram.andM;Illustrator 3.0 requires 2 MB of memory.andP;  It will sell for $595 and win beshipped in September.andP;  Existing Illustrator users who order before December31 can upgrade for $99.andP;  After that, it will cost $149.andP;  Customers who buythe old Illustrator before 3.0 is shipped will get the upgrade free.andP;  In eachcase, Illustrator 3.0 includes ATM 2.0.andM;ATM 2.andP;  One of the most impressive things about Illustrator 3.0 is the speedwith which it generates type.andP;  Even on a plain-vanilla Mac 11, you can edittext, size type, rotate it and even slide it along a curved baseline withsurprising speed.andM;This is because Illustrator 3.0 uses a new and considerably faster version ofAdobe Type Manager (ATM).andP;  Adobe claims that the new version, 2.0, is twiceas fast as the original ATM even on a low-end Mac, and that it producesbetter-looking screen type.andM;It also includes a new method for installing fonts in the Macintosh systemfolder.andP;  Rather than using the standard Apple Font/DA Mover (which couldsometimes change Font ID numbers), Adobe now provides its own Font Porterutility.andP;  This allows the user to install fonts by simply dragging them intothe system folder and restarting the Macintosh.andM;Macintosh ATM users can upgrade to 2.0 for $20.00 plus $7.50 postage andhandling.andP;  For an additional $19, you can get any Adobe Typeface Library fontpackage as part of the deal.andM;Editable PostScript? One of the most interesting aspects of Illustrator 3.0is that it must, of course, produce a text and graphics file format thatIllustrator 3.0 is able to read and edit.andP;  We understand that Adobe willpublish this format.andM;Although Adobe does not claim that this represents the oft-requested editablePostScript file format, it is likely that people will begin to use it in thisfashion.andP;  We have not yet seen the format and do not know how cumbersome itis, but we imagine that it could provide an interesting data format fortransfer of everything from display advertisements to annotated technicalillustrations.andP;  (See related story on interchange formats later in thisissue.)andO;</TEXT></DOC>
