A report released this week says most husbands' lack ofcooperation in housework and child-rearing is making thesingle life look better and better to many women. Ifhousewives' lives were to become more pleasant, the reasoninggoes, more single women would favor marriage, and more babieswould be born, the report says.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There is still a {strong} sense {among males} that it isquite natural for females to take care of household choresand child-rearing,&quot; the report says. In a nation famous forlong commutes and even longer working hours, the report alsocalls for a modification of employment practices to allow mento return home earlier so that they can be more involved inhousehold affairs.

The report says many females now consider it a burden toraise children because their lives as single women havebecome more enjoyable because of increasing jobopportunities. Statistics back up the council's fears. Thepercentage of women between the ages of 25 and 29 who aresingle rose to 37.3% in 1989 from 20.9% in 1975.   The Japanese government fears that if the current lowbirthrate continues, it will jeopardize the country'seconomic growth and accelerate the aging of the population,disrupting the social-security system.   Japan's birthrate has been declining since 1973, accordingto the Health and Welfare Ministry. In 1989, the latest yearfor which statistics are available, there were 10.2 childrenborn for every 1,000 people. That's down from 34.3 childrenper 1,000 in 1947 and 19.4 children per 1,000 in 1973. By theyear 2020, one of every four people will be 65 or older,estimates show.</TEXT></DOC>
