In this capital city, Collor de Mello supporters celebrated inthe streets, beating drums and waving party flags. The dappercandidate appeared briefly for photographers outside his Brasiliamansion, smiling and making a ``V'' for victory sign but offeringno comment.   However, officials of leftist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's partysaid it was too early for their candidate to concede defeat.   ``We won't give up until the last vote is counted,'' saidWorkers Party President Luiz Gushinken. ``The important thing arethe Court's official figures.''   The Supreme Electoral Court said leftist Luis Inacio Lula daSilva was leading Collor de Mello by less than 1 percent in a tallybased on 60 percent of the votes. The official tally was slowbecause state returns were being double-checked to avoid error.   But Irineu Tamanini, spokesman for the Electoral Court, saidCollor de Mello would overtake da Silva by late Monday as returnscame in from the candidate's strongholds in remote central andnorthern regions, where ballot boxes were taken to vote-countingcenters by canoe and mule.   The final result will be announced by Wednesday, Tamanini said.   The winner is to succeed President Jose Sarney on March 15 andserve five years, but pressure is growing for Sarney to resignearlier. Two Cabinet members said Sunday said the president-electshould take office soon because of severe economic problems.   In a first round of voting Nov. 15, Collor de Mello and da Silvagot the most votes of 21 candidates, but neither won a majority.   Collor de Mello, 40, formed the National Reconstruction Partyless than a year ago. He is a proponent of free markets, cleaningup corruption in government and paying the $110 billion foreigndebt _ largest in the developing world _ but on less burdensometerms.   The business, military and media establishments united behindCollor de Mello, who comes from a wealthy family with a longpolitical tradition.   Da Silva, 44, urged sweeping land reform, redistribution ofincome and immediate suspension of payments on the foreign debt.   Near the northeastern city of Santa Barbara, five cars carryingpeople back from voting dropped into a 30-foot-deep crater left ina road by heavy rains, said civil defense official Gloria Pires daSilva. She said 15 people were killed in Sunday's accident.   Globo TV, the nation's largest television network, projectedCollor de Mello as the winner and had him ahead by 3 million votes,or 5.1 percent, in an unofficial tally based on 86.8 percent ofreturns.   Network owner Roberto Marinho supported Collor de Mello, butGlobo TV said all its results were compiled from returns announcedby state election officials.   Four private polling institutes said Monday afternoon Collor deMello would be the winner by 3.5 to 4.5 million votes, a 4 to 6percent margin.   ``There is no doubt that Collor de Mello is the next presidentof Brazil,'' said Carlos Matheus, director of the Gallup pollinginstitute.   Da Silva _ known as Lula, the nickname he has made part of hislegal name _ led early in the official count on the basis ofreturns from two strongholds, the southern cities of Porto Alegreand Rio de Janeiro.   Collor de Mello rebounded with a strong showing in Sao Paulo,Brazil's wealthiest and most populous state, and in thesoutheastern industrial and farming state of Minas Gerais.   Roberto Rosas of the Electoral Court said the Electoral Courtwas investigating charges by the Workers Party, da Silva'sorganization, that voters could not get to polling stations inBahia and Ceara states, both da Silva country, because private buscompanies took their vehicles off the street.   ``If the difference between the candidates is slight, the Courtwill set a third election date for municipalities that had troublevoting,'' Rosas told The Associated Press.   News of Collor de Mello's lead stabilized financial marketsMonday and caused a sharp decline of the dollar's value on theillegal, but tolerated, black market. The price of a dollar was 17new cruzados Monday, down from 22 at the close of business Friday.   Brazil was ruled by the military in 1964-85 and Sunday'selection was hailed as a significant step toward full restorationof democracy.   On the minds of the 82 million registered voters in this nationof 150 million people were annual inflation of 1,500 percent,declining real wages, official corruption and the largest foreigndebt in the Third World.   The last Brazilian president chosen directly by the people wasJanio Quadros. He resigned in 1961, after seven months in office,and the military overthrew his vice president and successor, JoaoGoulart, in 1964.   Sarney was chosen by an electoral college in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
