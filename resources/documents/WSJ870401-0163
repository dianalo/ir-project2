Edgar Hoover (Bookshelf, March 5; letter, March 24), there has been a steady drumbeat of criticism of Mr. Hoover since his death. Your readers may be interested in the fact that in the fateful 1953 period when the Eisenhower administration was under attack by the right-wing of the Republican Party, I served as chief consultant to Robert L. Johnson, who had been asked by the president and Secretary of State Dulles to reorganize the International Information Adminstration, then in the State Department, and, with the help of Congress, transform it into an independent agency, now known as U.S. Information Agency.    The most effective help my boss and I got from anyone in the administration came from J. Edgar Hoover. Time and again in crucial moments, I received a call from Mr. Hoover which enabled us to avoid serious problems with Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his retinue of aides.    Even in those days it was alleged that Mr. Hoover worked hand in glove with Sen. McCarthy. I cannot help but wonder whether we are not taking unfair advantage of a man who served his country well and who is no longer around to respond to criticsm.
