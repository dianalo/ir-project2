So far this year, carriers have placed firm orders for 642 aircraft, totaling about $30.7 billion. That doesn't include the hundreds of additional planes under option for future purchase by airlines.    Last week's record-setting $10.5 billion order from Delta Air Lines, benefiting McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Boeing Co., is only the latest sign of booming business. But while booms -- and the busts that inevitably seem to follow -- aren't altogether uncommon in the airliner business, this round of mega-orders may just prove to be extraordinary. Many analysts and the Big Three of the aircraft industry -- including Airbus Industrie -- predict the order spurt will mark the takeoff of a period of soaring demand.    If the analysts and industry planners are proven correct, it could mean two decades of prosperity for the commercial aircraft industry. Total jetliner sales from now through the year 2000 could be worth $353 billion, says Edmund S. Greenslet, a Greenwich, Conn., airline consultant.    The development offers a glimmer of hope for America's dim balance-of-trade picture. Although international subcontracting and partnerships are becoming the norm in aerospace sales, U.S. concerns can look forward to improving sharply on the $6.4 billion in jet transports and related equipment they exported last year to lead all other commercial industries.    Some industry watchers caution, though, that economic recession, oil price shocks and other unforeseen factors could puncture jetliner sales forecasts, as they have before. Also, there's concern that the industry might not be able to manage a long-term onslaught of orders. Production bottlenecks and other manufacturer problems have kept the industry from gearing up smoothly even in the best of times.    Aircraft building these days, though, seems to many analysts to be far less vulnerable to such a reversal. &quot;What's different this time,&quot; says Michael Derchin, airline analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., &quot;is that the reasons underlying the boom aren't cyclical.&quot;    Some orders, Mr. Derchin says, can be attributed to cyclical factors, such as air-traffic demand -- expected to grow an average 5% a year through 2005 -- and the current financial health among U.S. carriers, which are expected to experience their sixth consecutive year of operating earnings, following years of red ink.    But most of today's demand for aircraft, Mr. Derchin and others insist, results from a range of forces altering the structure of the world's airline industry.    --Airline deregulation, 10 years old in the U.S., suddenly has become a major trend around the world. It has spurred creation of new airlines and expanded routes in Canada, Japan, Australia and in the Common Market countries, where even more growth is expected by 1992, when deregulation's full effect will be felt. Even Warsaw Pact nations have been touched by it, as the flag carriers of four Eastern European governments for the first time in decades have been permitted to shop for Western-built aircraft.    --Pacific Rim prosperity is creating both new and hugely expanded markets. Japan's All Nippon Airways plans to triple its international flights, while new routes involving Seoul and Hong Kong are cropping up, and China is eagerly modernizing and expanding its domestic fleet. &quot;That's pioneer territory,&quot; says George James of Airline Economics Inc., a consulting firm.    --The &quot;geriatric jet&quot; issue is finally registering with airlines. Particularly in the U.S., the growing consensus among air-safety professionals now is that carriers should begin replacing jetliners built more than 20 years ago. Many of the oldest aircraft that haven't been subjected to costly overhauls are obsolete anyway, because noise-abatement regulations prohibit them from landing at most major airports. It took the Aloha Airlines accident earlier this year in Hawaii to get some airlines moving, making their flying public aware of the issue through the harrowing case of an old plane that lost its corroded roof.    --The slow response of regulators and airport officials to the growing air-terminal capacity shortage is forcing airlines to buy larger planes to accommodate growth. The unexpected spurt in European passenger demand this year, far outstripping the 6% increase forecast and causing lengthy delays there, has led the airline industry to push for crisis-management training, improved air-traffic planning and an upgrading of control equipment. These changes, like the new air-traffic-control system in the U.S., will take years to carry out.    Even as they prepare for longer-term fleet growth, airlines' need to respond to current demand has been a powerful force behind the latest orders.    After accumulating short-range planes with 150 or fewer seats in recent years, airline executives are rethinking their &quot;mixes&quot; of planes, focusing on larger planes to increase the load per flight out of crowded airports. Lately, manufacturers have scrambled to meet a need for bigger mid-range planes, with Boeing for now seeming to have a leg up in the area. Boeing has already taken 165 orders and options for its 757 twin-jet this year. Airlines are buying the 182-seat plane to replace older jets that seat 25% less passengers.    To catch some of the popular 757's market, Airbus plans to lengthen its 150-passenger A-320 and add 50 seats. While St. Louis-based McDonnell can add seats to its 142-passenger MD-80, its capacity doesn't approach that of the others' offerings.    This year's rush to order marks the end of a waiting game airlines had been playing, as fuel prices held steady and gave carriers little incentive to replace older, less-fuel-efficient 727s and DC-8s, among other planes. Lately, the waiting has changed to queuing up for aircraft deliveries. &quot;You cannot stand by once your competition orders if you don't have equivalent equipment,&quot; says George James, of Airline Economics Inc., a consulting firm.    The Big Three face the challenge of handling the current boom better than past ones, especially the disastrous &quot;bet-the-company&quot; period of the late 1960s. Then, production lines started churning out nearly-identical Lockheed Corp. L-1011s and McDonnell DC-10 jumbo tri-jets at the same time Boeing was introducing its four-engine 747. The fledgling jumbo-jet market wasn't big enough to produce a profit at McDonnell or Lockheed. When the order boom burst into the crash of 1969, Boeing struggled to survive by laying off thousands of workers -- and causing a crisis in Seattle's Boeing-dependent economy. Lockheed, which eventually got out of the commercial-jet business, was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by a package of federal loan guarantees.    This time, aircraft builders are trying to slow the sales-and-delivery cycle by letting production rates inch up rather than jump and by keeping a tight cap on new hires. At Boeing, the 757 rate is being boosted to 60 aircraft a year from 48, though some analysts believe the company's expanding backlog could sustain an annual production rate of 120 aircraft. Airbus and McDonnell are likewise holding down production rates and employment growth, in a way they hope will flatten the wild swings in the traditional cycle without turning off customers.    By far, the boom's biggest beneficiary is Boeing. The Seattle giant's total firm-order backlog is up to 1,037 aircraft, and analysts expect the company to earn as much as $4 a share this year, compared with $3.10 last year. The only aircraft builder with models in the four major size categories -- what it calls its airliner &quot;family&quot; -- Boeing aleady can &quot;stretch&quot; or &quot;squeeze&quot; its basic jets to meet seating needs from 100 passengers to 600 plus. The family strategy cost Boeing dearly in the past when poorer-selling 757 and 767 models were draining the profits from the 747 and 737. But its recent success has led McDonnell and Airbus to imitation, stretching and squeezing their own models.    From its base of operations in Toulouse, France, Airbus is spawning the new A-330 and A-340 to compete with the Boeing 767 and 747. Meanwhile, the four-nation consortium has been looking for partners in the U.S. to help with plans to stretch its medium-range A-320. Lockheed recently made a pitch to open a U.S. production line for the A-320 at an underutilized Georgia plant, a move that would mark a re-entry of sorts into jetliner building for the aerospace concern based in Calabasas, Calif.    Lockheed is eager to use the space, while Airbus seeks financial relief from carrying most of its costs in European currencies while revenue is in less-valuable dollars. With Airbus officials anxious to avoid a U.S.-initiated trade action to retaliate against its aggressive price-cutting, industry executives say, a deal between the four-nation consortium and Lockheed could come to pass later this year.    At McDonnell, labor strife in its Long Beach, Calif., plant and difficulties getting suppliers geared up for the boom have delayed deliveries of the MD-80 &quot;family&quot; of aircraft lately. McDonnell, smallest of the Big Three in commercial sales, is scurrying to improve operations, and low morale at the company got an enormous boost from Delta's order for nine of its new MD-11 tri-jets, based on the DC-10 design, with options for 40 more and for 100 smaller MD-88s -- valued at $6.5 billion in all.    For now, plans for a &quot;McAirbus&quot; -- a jointly produced jumbo aimed at the highly profitable Boeing 747 monopoly -- seem to have stalled after two years of negotiations. References to the on-again, off-again venture with Airbus were conspicuously absent at a McDonnell news briefing at the recent air show in Farnborough, England. McDonnell executives unveiled a new &quot;stretch&quot; MD-11 plan, but said they're seeking partners for it in the Far East. At one time, they had talked about developing the model with Airbus wings.    To ride the next wave of orders in the extended boom time manufacturers expect, McDonnell is trying to capitalize on an edge it will have in the 1990s over Boeing: the ability to produce a plane powered by fuel-efficient &quot;prop-fan&quot; engines. The current MD-80 series planes could be fitted once the new, high-technology power plants are available, sometime after 1991. If airlines were to buy the McDonnell version, its prop-fan aircraft would beat Boeing to the market by several years. Boeing's plan, now on hold, has been to invest between $3 billion and $4 billion in an all-new prop-fan aircraft called the 7J7.    Boeing still is expected to continue as the high flyer in an aircraft market that the company projects will find room for 7,464 aircraft between now and the year 2005. But company officials are aware that times can change very quickly. Only two years ago, Boeing and Airbus were so desperate to persuade airlines to reach for their checkbooks that they each agreed to lease jetliners, a total of 25, to American Airlines. The leasing terms were so generous that analysts derogatorily labeled the deals &quot;rent-a-plane.&quot;    ---   Susan Carey contributed to this article.    ---                        Aircraft Sales          1988 commercial jetliner firm orders to date    Boeing Co.      489 firm orders      $20.4 billion                             66%    Airbus Industrie      149 firm orders      $ 6.7 billion                             22%    McDonnell Douglas Corp.       94 firm orders      $ 3.6 billion                             12%   (Revised WSJ Sept. 28, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
