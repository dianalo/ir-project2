The author says globalpeace can be attained only if we succeed in demilitarizing the East-Westconflict. Our security will also be enhanced, the author says, if instriving for peace, we can manage to shift the emphasis of the East-Westconflict from the military to the political and social fields. The authordiscusses how to achieve both of these steps. The author says securitycannot be guaranteed by mutual deterrence, along with some elements ofarms control, because the arms race threatens to get out of control.Global security can be enhanced only if the military confrontation isdiminished and gives way to the political competition. Political conflictsexist even in the domestic policies of nations; they will certainly goon indefinitely within the international system. Only when this conflictreaches a stage in which the use of arms is definitely excluded willglobal peace be attained.</TEXT></DOC>
