This programis based on transferring both know-why and know-how. The transfer ofknow-why and know-how is achieved most effectively by working in partnershipwith the recipient of the technology; by employing five primary transfermechanisms, according to the type of learning required; by treating thetechnology transfer as a designed process rather than an isolated event;and by using a project management approach to control and direct theprocess. This paper describes the philosophy, process, and training mechanismsthat have worked for Stone and Webster, as well as the project managementapproach needed for the most effective transfer of technology.</TEXT></DOC>
