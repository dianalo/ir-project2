(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Artificial intelligence  (AI) is still a dream at this point, but like manydreams, the ideas behind AI have bred practical technologies.andP;  Expert systemssuch as the $3,500 Windows 3.0-based Kappa, from Intellicorp, are the mostsuccessful of Al's spinoffs.andM;An expert system is so named because it mimics the reasoning achieved at theexpert level for the class of problem being solved.andP;  It uses sets ofpredetermined rules which act upon objects that represent things or ideas inorder to discover the most fitting solution to a problem.andM;In the past, using expert systems required massive hardware Purchases and acommitment to esoteric programming languages.andP;  IntelliCorp's new expertsystem shell, Kappa, heralds a new breed, Written in C, and running underWindows 3.0, it transfers the functionality of large unwieldy Al systems tothe desktop.andM;The move from LISP to C marks quite a significant change for IntelliCorp.andO;The company's previous shell, the Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE)required a beefed-up 386/486 or a dedicated LISP machine from eitherSymbolics or Texas Instruments.andP;  Acquiescing to the pressure of the businessenvironment, IntelliCorp introduced the Windows-based Kappa, which will runon 12-MHz 286-based PCs or better.andM;At $3,500, Kappa represents the middle of the road in expert systemstechnology.andP;  Many smaller, less-capable shells such as Paperback Software'sVp Expert and Emerald Intelligence's Mahogany are available for under $1,000, while large shells, including KEE, sell for well over $ 10,000 a copy.andM;Kappa is an object-oriented programming system that includes functions forrules and procedures and runs under Windows 3.0.andP;  The heart of Kappa is theKappa Application Language (KAL).andP;  KAL allows developers to representreal-world things and ideas as objects and then develop sets of rules toreason upon them.andM;Kappa's objects support a rich class structure and full inheritancecapabilities.andP;  Values for objects are stored in slots.andP;  A typical object,like BUICK: COLOR, might hold the value BLUE in the slot COLOR.andP;  Values forslots can be derived from the knowledge base itself, from rules and functionswritten in KAL, or from C programs linked into the development environment.andO;Kappa supports forward, backward, and mixed-mode reasoning, but the manualsuggests that developers define forward and backward chaining rulesseparately and that the mixed mode of reasoning be avoided.andM;Kappa's development console is attractive and easy to understand.andO;Programmers are asked to define, rules, patterns and analytic functionswithout relying on more traditional procedural programming.andP;  Clicking on anappropriate icon will invoke editors, browsers, or an inference session.andO;Some icons are linked to pop-up menus for execution of multiple functionslike editing or deleting rules and objects.andP;  Kappa includes a session iconthat can be linked to a custom user interface complete with buttons,scrolling windows, and animated objects.andP;  The use of this interface slowsdown the systems' performance, but makes Kappa a self-contained developmentenvironment.andP;  Other products, like Neuron Data's Nexpert Object, rely onenvironments like HyperCard and ToolBook for developing the interface.andP;  Thisleaves their allocation of the processor time to inference processing.andM;For maximum flexibility and performance, Kappa also comes as a set of Clibraries that can be linked into custom applications.andP;  So, any programmingenvironment with access to C libraries can benefit from the knowledgeprocessing capabilities of Kappa.andM;The primary difficulty with Kappa stems from its lack of integration with theWindows 3.0 environment.andP;  Kappa supports DDE but it lacks facilities thatbuffer developers from the grueling rigors of entering code in text editors.andO;In contrast, examining the text version of a knowledge base in NexpertObject, a competing product, can confuse you--but Neuron Data does a good jobof sheltering developers from their code structure through intelligenteditors that support pop-up menus for controlling syntax and copying keywordsand objects.andP;  Although Kappa runs under Windows and supports graphics, itsdevelopment environment is primarily character-based.andM;Kappa's input is accomplished in austere text edit windows, with no help froma graphic interface.andP;  Pop-up windows are used to copy keywords and objects,but they are without context.andP;  Navigation inside Kappa is also poor.andP;  Youcannot move from one rule to the next without a dialog box intermediary andthere is no way to jump from the object editor to the rule editor.andO;IntelliCorp needs to concentrate on embedding Windows' GUI philosophy intoKappa.andM;The current incarnation of Kappa is a useful tool, but probably not for themasses.andP;  Its syntax is difficult and relies too heavily on character-basedoperation.andP;  The price is a bargain to those coming from the expert systemscommunity, but it's quite steep for the PC Windows world.andP;  (A $450 runtimeversion takes some of the sting away.) Still, by porting this well-known LISPprogram to C and Windows, IntelliCorp is demonstrating a clear understandingof the future of AI.andM;FACT FILEandM;Kappa, Version 1.1 intelliCorp, 1975 El Camino Real, W. Mountain View, CA94040-2216; (415) 965-5500.andM;List Price, $3,500 for development systems, $450 each for runtime.andM;Requires: 12-MHz 286 or better.andP;  640K and EGA graphics requited.andM;In Short: Kappa is an exciting entry into the expert systems market.andP;  Sinceit comes from one of the leaders in Al technology, hopefully it will continueto grow in features and abilities.andP;  Version 1.1 is compact and runsmedium-size systems in 640K, but its lack of integration with the Windowsparadigm will keep it in the hands of systems developers rather than openingup opportunities for new users.andM;CIRCLE 435 ON READER SERVICE CARD</TEXT></DOC>
