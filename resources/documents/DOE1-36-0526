The introduction of computerizedtomography (CT) and the further development of this modality since 1972have contributed significantly to the staging of these neoplasms. CTnot only demonstrates soft tissue densities, but also bony structures,muscles, fascial planes, opacified vascular structures, and enlargedlymph nodes. CT, however, fails to differentiate the various histologictypes of lesions in the majority of cases. Features such as size of thelesion, marginal definition, lytic bone destruction, sclerotic bony reaction,bony expansion, calcific densities, fat content, and obliteration offascial planes are utilized to delimit the spectrum of diagnostic possibilities.Conventional films including tomography are also indicated as preliminaryexaminations in the investigation of head and neck neoplasms. They providea survey of the abnormality in question and form the basis for specialstudies such as CT and angiography. They are often the first examinationto demonstrate a lesion that may be suspected from the history and clinicalexamination. 13 refs.; 11 figs. Includes index</TEXT></DOC>
