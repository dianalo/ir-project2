The series of laws to introduce market-oriented reforms aredesigned to turn around the faltering economy and bolster PremierBranko Mikulic's much-criticized Cabinet.   Yugoslavia's inflation rate _ the highest in Europe _ is runningat close to 300 percent and the country is grappling with a $21billion debt and rising unemployment.   This year there have been a record 1,000-plus strikes to demandhigher wages and protest sinking living standards.   ``Expectations, and even demands, are unrealistic,'' that dozensof laws regulating the economic reform could be passed before Dec.31, Tanjug quoted Milosavljevic as saying.   Yugoslavia's parliament was meeting through the weekend to passat least nine laws considered crucial to the reform.   The rest would be passed by mid-1989, Milosavljevic said.   Mikulic's government has been harshly criticized for itsunsuccessful anti-inflation policies and failure to halt theeconomic decline, leading to speculation that the government maysoon be forced to resign.   The Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje commented that the inflation rate``hangs like the sword of Damocles'' over Mikulic's Cabinet.   Vecernje Novosti Belgrade daily on Saturday charged Mikulic``sowed unfounded hope that his government would win the battle foreconomic reform ... and threw in despair every honest worker whocould no longer cope with the inflation''</TEXT></DOC>
