Executive Summary</ITAG>A. New Rule 144AThe Commission is proposing for comment a new Rule 144A that would providea non-exclusive safe harbor from the registration requirements of the SecuritiesAct \1\<NOTE/> for resales of securities to institutional investors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 77a <T3>et seq.</T3>The rule provides a safe harbor for three tiers of transactions. The firsttier (the ``qualified institutional buyer tier'') would permit unlimitedresales of any securities of any issuer, provided that the purchaser wasa specified institution with assets in excess of $100 million or that theseller reasonably believed that the purchaser was such a qualified institution.The second tier (the ``non-fungible securities tier'') would allow unlimitedresales of securities to a wider class of specified institutions, if (i)securities of the class offered or sold were not quoted in an inter-dealerquotation system, listed on a securities exchange in the United States,or issued by an open-end investment company, unit investment trust or face-amountcertificate company that is registered under section 8 of the InvestmentCompany Act of 1940 (the ``Investment Company Act''),\2\<NOTE/> and (ii) the securities were non-convertible debt securities,non-convertible preferred stock or securities issued by a company subjectto a continuous reporting obligation under the Securities Exchange Actof 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'').\3\<NOTE/> The third tier of proposed Rule 144A would cover resalesof non-convertible debt securities, non-convertible preferred stock andsecurities of reporting companies that are traded in a public market inthe United States (``fungible securities'') to the same class of institutionsas permitted in the second tier.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 15 U.S.C. 80a-8.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 15 U.S.C. 78a <T3>et seq.</T3>The qualified institutional buyer and non-fungible securities tiers ofthe proposed Rule impose no resale restrictions, requiring only that theseller or any person acting on its behalf take reasonable steps to ensurethat the buyer is aware that the seller may rely on the exemption fromthe Securities Act's registration requirements afforded by Rule 144A. Incontrast the fungible securities tier requires that the seller or any personacting on its behalf take reasonable steps to prevent the purchaser fromreselling the securities in the United States unless they are registeredunder the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available.The rule sets forth a non-exclusive method by which that obligation canbe satisfied.The proposed Rule provides a safe harbor exemption from the registrationrequirements of the Securities Act that would not be exclusive. Attemptedreliance on the new safe harbor would not preclude the availability ofany other exemption from registration under the Act.The Commission also is considering adoption of each tier of the Rule independently,or adoption of two tiers without the third. Moreover, the Commission maychoose to proceed with one or two tiers of the Rule prior to reaching afinal determination as to adoption of the other(s).B. Amendments to Rules 144 and 145The Commission also is proposing for comment amendments to rules 144 and145. Rule 144 permits the public resale of restricted securities when certainconditions, including a minimum holding period, are met. Under the proposedamendments, the time that must elapse before public resale of restrictedsecurities (whether acquired in reliance on Rule 144A or otherwise) wouldbe redefined to commence when the securities are sold by the issuer orits affiliate. Because Rule 145 holding periods are determined by referenceto Rule 144, Rule 145 is proposed to be amended to reflect the proposedchanges to Rule 144.The proposed changes to the holding period requirements, which would permitsubsequent unaffiliated purchasers to satisfy the requirements throughuse of the period in which their seller held the securities, would affecttrading in all restricted securities, not only those sold under proposedRule 144A. The proposals thus involve issues that extend beyond the implicationsfor proposed Rule 144A and may be considered by the Commission separately.Accordingly, commentators should address not only the impact of adoptionof the two proposals in tandem, but also the potential separate effectof each.<ITAG tagnum="84">II.

Institutional Sales Under the Federal Securities Laws</ITAG>The Congress and the Commission historically have recognized the abilityof professional institutional investors to make investment decisions withoutthe protections mandated by the registration requirement of the SecuritiesAct. The Commission has not until now, however, formally addressed thedifference between the institutional and public resale markets. The institutionalresale market for restricted securities has evolved to a point where itsexistence should be acknowledged.Proposed Rule 144A could have a significant impact on both the primaryand secondary domestic markets for unregistered securities of reportingas well as nonreporting issuers.\8\\9\<NOTE/> Removing uncertainties as to the legitimacy of resales toinstitutional buyers by providing a safe harbor from registration couldpermit some transactions to take place that otherwise might not occur.Such transactions might include resales by persons that purchased securitiesprivately with a view to their immediate resale to a number of institutions.Providing a framework in which institutional resales could be made freelymay increase the efficiency of the private placement market. Liquidityin the market may increase,\9\\0\<NOTE/> not only as the result of increased efficiency, but alsoas a consequence of the resale provisions of proposed Regulation S.\9\\1\<NOTE/> The potential increase in efficiency and liquidity couldsignificantly lower the discount commonly associated with private placements,\9\\2\<NOTE/> which in turn may attract an increasing number of issuersto the private placement market.\9\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\9\ Issuers in the ``non-reporting'' category would includestart-up companies and foreign issuers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\0\ The perception among investors of illiquidity in theprivate placement market has been cited as a reason why some investorsavoid the market. Market Participants, <T3>supra </T3>n. 17.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\1\ Proposed Regulation S (17 CFR 230.901-230.906), SecuritiesAct Release No. 6779 (June 10, 1988) (53 FR 22661). The resale safe harborof Rule 906 of proposed Regulation S, which allows persons other than issuersor underwriters to sell specified unregistered securities on foreign securitiesexchanges without imposing resale restrictions, should provide significantlymore liquidity for restricted securities of foreign issuers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\2\ <T3>See supra</T3> n. 44.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\3\ Market Participants, <T3>supra</T3> n. 17. For example, U.S. issuers who now raise capital throughthe international capital market might instead elect to offer their securitiesthrough private placements in the United States. The Rule may have significant implications for offerings by foreign issuers.Foreign issuers who previously may have foregone raising capital in theUnited States due to the compliance costs and liability exposure associatedwith registered public offerings, and the costs of financing inherent inplacing restricted securities, may find private placements in the UnitedStates a more viable capital-raising option as a result of the combinedeffect of proposed Rule 144A and proposed Regulation S. Greater participationby foreign issuers in the U.S. capital market also would have the benefitof reducing the costs borne by U.S. institutional investors that wish toinvest in foreign securities and are compelled at present to go overseasto obtain such securities. Moreover, U.S. intermediaries who may have lostbusiness to foreign competitors simply because such securities may be availableonly offshore may be afforded more opportunities to participate in theinternationalization of investment strategies.While the Commission recognizes that a substantial institutional resalemarket currently exists, it anticipates that the development under Rule144A of more formal, active trading markets will raise questions as tothe effect of institutional markets on the efficiency and liquidity ofthe public trading markets. Those consequences need to be understood inconsidering adoption of Rule 144A, and, if the Commission determines toproceed, in determining whether to adopt the three tiers of the proposedRule as a package, separately at different points in time, or in some combination.The Commission anticipates that resales made in reliance on Rule 144A,whether executed on proposed closed systems such as PORTAL or SITUS \9\\4\<NOTE/> or elsewhere, would be used principally for transactionsinvolving debt securities, preferred stock or common equity securitiesof a class not already publicly traded in the United States. While thequalified institutional buyer and fungible securities tiers of the Rulewould be available for transactions in securities that are fungible withsecurities publicly traded in the United States, the Commission does notexpect that Rule 144A would give rise to any significant volume of privatetransactions in classes of publicly traded securities. That is not currentlythe case,\9\\5\<NOTE/> and, notwithstanding the potential for increased efficiencyin the private resale market and the ability to avoid costs and delaysassociated with registration, it may not be financially advantageous inthe future for companies to sell securities in a market that was comparativelylimited in its depth and liquidity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\4\ <T3>See infra</T3> n. 191.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\5\ <T3>See supra</T3> n. 43.Nonetheless, the Commission requests comment on the likelihood that anactive, liquid private market will develop alongside a public market forthe same class of securities in the United States. If such a developmentis viewed as likely, comment is requested on the nature of such markets,the consequences to the liquidity and efficiency of the public market forsuch securities, and whether any steps should be taken to prevent sucha development. For example, should reliance on Rule 144A be precluded withrespect to any class of securities that is registered under the SecuritiesAct or the Exchange Act? Comment also is requested on the likelihood thatarbitrage would occur between the public and private markets for commonstock, if dual markets were to develop; whether such arbitrage would bebeneficial or harmful to the U.S. markets; if harmful, how it might bediscouraged, and if beneficial, how it might be encouraged? Commentersshould indicate whether their responses to the above questions would differdepending on whether the qualified institutional buyer tier of proposedRule 144A, the fungible securities tier, or both were adopted.The Commission also requests comment as to whether the risks of marketmanipulation and insider trading will increase significantly enough withthe evolution of a more active institutional market that the Commissionshould permit such a market to develop only in a more formalized structuresubject to surveillance, Commission oversight, and transaction reportingrequirements.The Commission also anticipates that proposed Rule 144A will facilitate,and thereby encourage, dealers' purchases of securities, particularly foreignsecurities, either in primary offerings or secondary transactions, witha view to resale in the United States. The Commission requests commenton the appropriateness, and the potential consequences, of the use of theRule to exempt from registration such resales to institutions purchasers.The Commission also recognizes that, by increasing the efficiency of theresale market for ``restricted securities,'' issuers, particularly foreignissuers, that eventually might have chosen to register their securitiesfor public sale in the United States, may forego registration and stillhave the benefits of access to the U.S. markets. Market participants havesuggested that foreign issuers choosing to sell securities publicly inthe United States do so for reasons not directly related to capital-raisingneeds, such as obtaining name recognition in the U.S. capital markets.The Commission requests comment on the likelihood that adoption of anyof the three tiers of proposed Rule 144A, or some combination of the threetiers, might diminish the number of foreign issuers that eventually wouldchoose to make a public offering in the United States. Similarly, how wouldthe adoption of any or all of the three tiers affect the process by whichdomestic issuers typically first access the private market and then graduateto registered public offerings?To the extent that an active institutional trading market continues toevolve, the trading market interest, both institutional and retail, inthe securities of the issuer is likely to increase. In such case, the potentialfor ``leakage'' into the retail market would be greater, particularly inthe case of common equity securities. Under section 12(g) of the ExchangeAct, the public markets would be protected in the case of domestic issuersbecause reporting obligations generally will be incurred when any classof equity securities is held by 500 or more persons.\9\\6\<NOTE/> In the case of foreign securities, however, under currentrules, there would be no such protection because Rule 12g3-2(b) \9\\7\<NOTE/> would permit the securities to be held by any number of shareholdersso long as the securities were not quoted in NASDAQ or listed on U.S. securitiesexchanges. Rule 144A can thus be expected to create the potential for greatertrading in foreign securities in the United States. In addition, the proposedchanges to rule 144, which will in many cases telescope the required holdingperiod for securities, could further accelerate this development. In lightof this potential, the Commission requests comment on the appropriatenessof continuing the exemption provided by Rule 12g3-2(b) for issuers whosesecurities are widely held by non-institutional investors, if proposedRule 144A (particularly the qualified institutional buyer tier), the proposedchange to Rule 144 or both were adopted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\6\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>l</T3>(g).

Footnote 58 of the Rule 3b-9 release should not be read as aCommission statement that a ``non-public offering'' can be a ``distribution.''<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Proposed Rule 144A </ITAG>A. General Proposed Rule 144A sets forth a non-exclusive safe harbor from the registrationrequirements of section 5 of the Securities Act for the sale of securitiesto specified institutions by persons other than the issuer of such securities.The transactions covered by the safe harbor are those private transactionsthat on the basis of a few objective standards can be defined as outsidethe purview of section 5, without the necessity of undertaking the moreusual analysis under sections 4(1) and 4(3) of the Securities Act. TheCommission wishes to emphasize that proposed Rule 144A is not intendedto preclude reliance on traditional facts-and-circumstances analysis toprove the availability of an exemption outside the safe harbor it provides.The Rule would provide that, if its conditions were met, any person (otherthan the issuer or a dealer) who offered or sold securities would be deemednot to be engaged in a ``distribution'' and therefore not to be an ``underwriter''within the meaning of secitons 2(11) and 4(1) of the Securities Act.\1\\4\\6\<NOTE/> Similarly, if the conditions of the proposed Rule were met,a dealer would be deemed not to be a participant in the ``distribution''of securities within the meaning of seciton 4(3)(C) of the Act, and thesecurities would be deemed not to have been offered ``to the public'' withinthe meaning of section 4(3)(A) of the Act.\1\\4\\7\<NOTE/> The Rule, in effect, defines a class of transactions as outsidethe term ``distribution.'' It does not, however, provide the exclusivemeans to establish the lack of a ``distribution,'' and thus an exemptionfrom the Securities Act registration requirements.\1\\4\\8\<NOTE/> Each transaction would be assessed under the Rule indiviudually.The exemption for an offer and sale complying with the Rule would be unaffectedby other transactions of the seller. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\\6\ <T3>See</T3> paragraph (b) of the Proposal. This formulation was used bythe Commission in establishing Rule 144. <T3>See </T3>Rule 144(b) (17 CFR 230.144(b)), <T3>supra</T3> n. 139. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\\7\ <T3>See</T3> paragraph (c) of the Proposal. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\\8\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Rule 144 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.144).Nothing in the Rule would remove the neeed to comply with any applicablestate law relating to the offer and sale of securities.\1\\4\\9\<NOTE/> Similarly, the Rule does not affect the securities registrationrequirements of section 12 of the Exchange Act or the broker-dealer registrationrequirements of section 15(a) of the Exchange Act for a broker or dealerwho effects private placement transactions.\1\\5\\0\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\\9\ <T3>See</T3> Preliminary Note 3 of the Proposal. <T3>See also supra</T3> n. 133. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\0\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>l</T3>, 78<T3>o</T3>(a), <T3>See </T3>Preliminary Note 2 of the Proposal. Likewise, the proposedRule would have no effect on the application of Rule 10b-6 under the ExchangeAct (17 CFR 240.10b-6) to an offer and sale of securities pursuant to Rule144A ``that is distinguished from ordinary trading transactions by themagnitude of the offering and the presence of special selling efforts andselling methods.'' Rule 10b-6(c)(5) (17CFR 240.10b-6(c)(5)). Resales made in reliance on proposed Rule 144A could only be made to theinstitutions specified in the three tiers of the Rule or to persons theseller reasonably believed were such institutions. Sales to individualinvestors could not be made in reliance on Rule 144A. Sales to individualswould continue to be subject to the traditional analysis under section4(1) or 4(3) of the Securities Act.\1\\5\\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\1\ <T3>See supra</T3> text accompanying nn. 138-144. The Rule is not intended to eliminate or otherwise affect the availabilityof any exemption for resales under the Securities Act on which a sellermight be able to rely.\152\<NOTE/> Securities sold in reliance on Rule 144A would not be includedin determining the amount of securities which could be sold by a personin compliance with the volume limitations in subsection (e) of Rule 144.\153\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\152\ <T3>See</T3> Preliminary Note 1 of the Proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\153\ <T3>See</T3> Rule 144(e)(3)(vii) under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.144(e)(3)(vii)).There may be some concern regarding possible integration of an otherwiseexempt transaction with resales under Rule 144A. In order to eliminateuncertainty in this area, the proposed Rule specifically provides thatresales made in reliance on Rule 144A shall be deemed not to affect theavailability of any exemption for the previous or subsequent sale of thesecurities by the issuer or any prior or subsequent holder.\154\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\154\ <T3>See</T3> paragraph (e) of the Proposal.Foreign issuers may have concerns regarding inadvertent entry into theExchange Act registration and reporting system if the proposed Rule isused to make resales in the United States. Rule 12g3-2(a) provides an exemptionfrom the reporting requirements of section 12(g) of the Exchange Act forclasses of securities of foreign private issuers held by fewer than 300U.S. residents.\155\<NOTE/> If that threshold is reached, Rule 12g3-2(b) under the ExchangeAct at present provides an exemption from this obligation for a foreignprivate issuer if it furnishes to the Commission specified informationit otherwise makes publicly available.\156\<NOTE/> As noted above, the Commission is concerned that the availabilityof Rule 12g3-2(b) may be inappropriate if a large U.S. non-NASDAQ, non-exchangemarket develops for a foreign issuer's securities, and has requested commentson that issue.\157\<NOTE/> Even if the Commission eventually were to determine to eliminateor limit the availability of Rule 12g3-2(b) in the case of substantialmarket activity, it would retain the power under section 12(h) of the ExchangeAct \158\<NOTE/> to exempt an issuer by order from, <T3>inter alia</T3>, the reporting requirements of section 12(g), whereit finds such exemption appropriate and in the public interest.

The Three Tiers of the RuleProposed Rule 144A contains three tiers. The Commission solicits commenton adoption of each of the three separately and in any combination, aswell as adoption of different tiers at different times.The first, or qualified institutional buyer, tier would cover any securitiesof any issuer.\159\<NOTE/> It would not require the seller to take any specific stepsto prevent an unregistered distribution, other than taking reasonable stepsto ensure that the buyer is aware that the seller may rely on the exemptionfrom the Securities Act registration requirements provided by the Rule.This tier would, however, be limited to potential buyers that are verylarge institutions, long involved in the resale market for restricted securities,as to which there has been little concern with respect to section 5 implications.The breadth of the securities covered by this tier of the proposed Rulegives full effect to the concept that these large institutional investorsare fully able to fend for themselves.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\159\ <T3>See</T3> paragraph (d)(1) of the Proposal.The second, or non-fungible securities, tier of the proposed Rule is lessrestricted as to potential purchasers, but more restricted as to the typesof securities covered.\160\<NOTE/> The securities covered would be non-convertible debt securities,non-convertible preferred stock, and securities issued by reporting companies.Historically, a wide range of institutions has been engaged in the privateresale market for senior securities. These institutions may not need theprotections attendant to registration under the Securities Act with respectto such senior securities. Furthermore, where the information requiredby the Exchange Act is publicly available, institutions of this broaderclass may be able adequately to fend for themselves even with respect tocommon equity securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\160\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(2) of the Proposal.The securities that could be sold under this tier of the proposal mustbe of a class that is not publicly traded in the United States. Given thisrequirement of non-fungibility, the securities would be less likely toleak into the public, retail, markets. With the general lack of a publicmarket for the securities, it would not be difficult to identify and tracesuch securities in the event of leakage. Moreover, in the case of debtand preferred stock, the market is generally institutional. Thus, likethe qualified institutional buyer tier of the proposed Rule, the non-fungiblesecurities tier would not impose resale restrictions.The third tier of the Rule would cover offers and sales of securities ofa class that is publicly traded in the United States, to the same rangeof institutions covered by the non-fungible securities tier.\1\\6\\1\<NOTE/> Like the non-fungible securities tier, the covered securitiesare limited to non-convertible debt, non-convertible preferred stock andsecurities issued by reporting companies. Given the greater likelihoodfor leakage of fungible securities into the retail markets and the greaterdifficulty in tracing that leakage, this tier of proposed Rule 144A wouldrequire the seller to take reasonable steps to prevent the purchaser fromreselling the securities in the United States in an unregistered, non-exemptdistribution.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\1\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(3) of the Proposal.C.

Qualified Institutional Buyers</ITAG>The first tier of proposed Rule 144A would permit resales of any securitiesof any issuer to a class of institutional investors defined as ``qualifiedinstitutional buyers.'' \1\\6\\2\<NOTE/> Under the proposal, resale would be permitted if the purchaserwas a qualified institutional buyer or its nominee, or if the seller andany persons acting on its behalf reasonably believed that the purchaserwas such an eligible buyer or its nominee. In determining whether a particularentity is a qualified institutional buyer, the seller and any person actingon its behalf would be permitted to rely on financial statements or othermaterial filed with the Commission, unless the seller or any person actingon its behalf knew or had reason to believe that the buyer was not a qualifiedinstitutional buyer.\1\\6\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\2\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(1) of the Proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\3\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(1)(i) of the Proposal.Qualified institutional buyers are defined in the proposed Rule to includeinstitutional buyers \1\\6\\4\<NOTE/> that have total assets in excess of $100 million.\1\\6\\5\<NOTE/> While the rule excludes corporations, partnerships, businesstrusts and charitable organizations formed for the purpose of acquiringthe securities offered, the Commission is considering and requests commenton inclusion of such entities in the qualified institutional buyer tierbecause of their size. This tier of the Rule specifically includes investmentadvisers as eligible buyers. Eligibility is conditioned upon their havingin excess of $100 million combined assets and assets under management.\1\\6\\6\<NOTE/> Comment is requested as to whether registered investmentadvisers should be specifically included as qualified institutional buyers,and as to the appropriateness of the asset test proposed. Also includedare investment companies that are part of a family of related investmentcompanies that has aggregate total assets in excess of $100 million.\1\\6\\7\<NOTE/> An entity also would be included if all of its equity ownerswere qualified institutional buyers.\1\\6\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\4\ ``Institutional buyers'' are eligible to purchaseunder the non-fungible securities and fungible securities tiers of theProposal. <T3>See infra </T3>Sections V.D.1. and V.E.1. This term generally includesthe types of institutional investors permitted to purchase from the issuerunder Regulation D under the Act. The qualified institutional buyer tieromits the asset tests set by Regulation D for certain institutions becauseit provides its own asset tests.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\5\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (a)(2) of the Proposal. Under paragraph (a)(3) ofthe Proposal, ``total assets'' is generally determined in accordance withthe provisions of Regulation S-X under the Act (17 CFR Part 210) and refersto the larger of the person's total assets or the total assets of the personand its consolidated subsidiaries. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\6\ <T3>See </T3>paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(3)(ii) of the Proposal. Withrespect to investment advisers registered under the Investment AdvisersAct, and solely for purposes of the qualified institutional buyer tier,``total assets'' includes any assets as to which the investment adviser,as an investment manager, exercises investment discretion, in additionto the total assets of the investment adviser. See paragraph (a)(3)(ii)of the Proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\7\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of the Proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\8\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of the Proposal.In defining a ``qualified institutional buyer,'' the Commission has attemptedto establish a level at which it can be confident that participating investorshave extensive experience in the private resale market for restricted securities.In addition, the Commission is seeking to identify a class of investorsthat can be conclusively assumed to be sophisticated and in little needof the protection afforded by the Securities Act's registration provisions.The $100 million threshold for assets or funds under management, moreover,follows that set forth in proposed Rule 15a-6 under the Exchange Act, whichexempts from the broker-dealer registration provisions foreign broker-dealersdoing business only with major institutional investors.\1\\6\\9\<NOTE/> The proposed asset limitation in Rule 15a-6(a) is based onthe view that direct U.S. oversight of foreign sales personnel might beof less significance where such personnel solicit only U.S. institutionalinvestors with high levels of assets. The $100 million asset level, derivedfrom the reporting standard of section 13(f) of the Exchange Act,\1\\7\\0\<NOTE/> is designed to increase the likelihood that the institutionwould have prior experience in foreign markets that provided insight intothe reliability and reputation of various foreign broker-dealers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\9\ <T3>See supra </T3>text accompanying nn. 130-132. Proposed Rule 15a-6,however, does not include a ``reasonable belief'' standard as regards aninstitution's meeting the $100 million threshold.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\0\ 15 U.S.C. 78m(f). Comment also is requested on the appropriateness of the threshold proposedfor identifying those institutions with the least need for the protectionprovided by registration. Should the treshold be lower (for example, assetsof $50 million) or higher (assets of $150 million or $200 million)? Commentis further requested on whether the qualified institutional buyer tiershould contain more stringent purchaser qualifications than those suggestedin the proposal, such as including fewer categories of institutions, orimposing different asset tests for different types of institutional investors.Would a net worth test be preferable to an asset test, and if so, whatlevel would be appropriate_$10-$25-$50-$100-million? Finally, comment isspecifically requested as to whether a ``reasonable belief'' standard regardingthe purchaser's qualifications is appropriate in this tier of the proposedrule.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Securities Covered</ITAG>The qualified institutional investor tier of the proposed Rule would applyto any securities of any issuer. As drafted, this tier of the proposalwould not require that buyers be provided with any information regardingthe issuer of the securities sold. Comment is requested on whether theproposed Rule should require that an issuer undertake either in the termsof the security or by contract to provide upon request of the securityholder basic information concerning the issuer. Commenters who believethat access to information should be required should also address whatinformation should be required. Should the level of information be comparableto that required under Rule 15c2-11 of the Exchange Act,\1\\7\\1\<NOTE/> or should more or less extensive information be required?Should an access requirement be limited to information the issuer providesto holders of its publicly traded securities, if any? The Commission alsorequests comments as to whether if access is to be mandated, there areother more efficient and less costly means of providing adequate information.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\1\ 17 CFR 240.15c2-11. Information required under thisrule would include, for non-reporting issuers, information regarding theissuer and its business, the issuer's most recent balance sheet and profitand loss and retained earnings statements for the last two years; or theinformation filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) (<T3>See supra</T3> n. 156). In the case of foreign issuers, if informationwas mandated, use of financial statements prepared under accounting principlesof foreign jurisdictions would be acceptable. Audited statements wouldnot be required.  <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Resale Restrictions </ITAG>Based on the sophistication and experience in the private resale marketof the proposed class of qualified institutional buyers, this tier of theproposed Rule does not impose resale restrictions. It would require onlythat the seller or any person acting on its behalf take reasonable stepsto ensure that each buyer is aware that the seller may rely on the registrationexemption provided by Rule 144A.\1\\7\\2\<NOTE/> It is the Commission's understanding that, under currentindustry practice, the obtaining of agreements as to the manner of resaleis considered unnecessary in many cases where large institutional investorsare involved, because they are sufficiently aware of the resale limitationson restricted securities and their potential liabilities under section5 for improper disposition of such securities. In such cases, therefore,buyers would be expected to take adequate steps to guard against a subsequentunregistered and non-exempt distribution of the securities sold under proposedRule 144A without any policing by the seller.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\2\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of the Proposal. See the discussion andsolicitation of comments in Section V.E.3. below concerning the adequacyof that notice procedure. Where the required notice was given, a seller's transaction would be protectedby the safe harbor, notwithstanding any unregistered, <T3>non-exempt </T3>offer or sale by a purchaser in the United States.In such cases the reselling purchaser would violate section 5, but notthe prior holder that sold in compliance with the safe harbor rule. D. The Non-Fungible Securities Tier <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Institutional Buyers </ITAG>Institutions specified in the non-fungible securities tier of proposedRule 144A as eligible ``institutional buyers'' include banks, broker-dealers,insurance companies, investment companies and certain employee benefitplans, and private business development companies.\1\\7\\3\<NOTE/> Corporations, charities, and partnerships would be includedto the extent that they had assets in excess of $5 million.\1\\7\\4\<NOTE/> An entity also would be included if all its equity holderswere institutional buyers.\1\\7\\5\<NOTE/> Investment advisers are not specifically included, but wouldbe eligible institutional buyers to the extent that they were corporationsor partnerships with total assets over $5 million.\1\\7\\6\<NOTE/> Comment is sought on the appropriateness of specificallyincluding investment advisers with total assets over $5 million, or whetheronly investment advisers with some higher amount of total assets shouldbe specifically included. Comment is also requested as to whether assetsunder management should be included in determining total assets for investmentadvisers. Finally, the Commission requests comment on whether there shouldbe an asset test (<T3>e.g.</T3>, $10 million, $25 million) applicable to all institutionalpurchasers covered by this second tier. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\3\ <T3>See </T3>paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of the Proposal. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\4\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of the Proposal. <ITAG tagnum="28">The term ``institutional buyer'' encompasses substantially the sameinstitutions as those specified in Rule 215 and Regulation D under theSecurities Act. Self-directed pension plans, which relate to individuals,are omitted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\5\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of the Proposal. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\6\ For purposes of the non-fungible securities tier(as well as the fungible securities tier), ``total assets'' is limitedto the total assets of the person or of that person and any consolidatedsubsidiaries thereof, whatever is larger and does not include assets undermanagement. <T3>See </T3>paragraph (a)(3) of the Proposal. The Commission currently has a proposal pending to add certain pensionplans established and maintained by a state, its political subdivisions,or any agency or instrumentality of a state or its political subdivisionsfor the benefit of its employees to the list of accredited investors underthe Regulation D.\1\\7\\7\<NOTE/> The Commission plans to include in the list of institutionalbuyers in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of proposed Rule 144A those plans that ultimatelyare defined to be accredited investors for purposes of Regulation D. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\7\ Securities Act Release No. 33-6759 (March 3, 1988)(53 FR 7870). As is the case with the qualified institutional buyer tier, the sellerwould be permitted to rely on the exemption provided by the non-fungiblesecurities tier of the proposed Rule even if the buyer was not an eligibleinstitutional buyer, provided that the seller and any person acting onits behalf reasonably believed that the purchaser was such an eligibleperson.\1\\7\\8\<NOTE/> Comment is requested as to the appropriateness of this reasonablebelief standard for the non-fungible securities tier. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\8\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the Proposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. </ITAG><T3>Securities Covered</T3>The availability of the non-fungible securities tier is limited to securitiesof a class that is neither quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system withinthe meaning of Rule 15c2-7(c) under the Exchange Act \1\\7\\9\<NOTE/> nor listed on a national securities exchange registered underSection 6 of the Exchange Act.\1\\8\\0\<NOTE/> This tier of the Rule also would not be available for securitiesissued by an open-end investment company, unit investment trust or face-amountcertificate company that is registered under section 8 of the InvestmentCompany Act. The second tier is thus limited to securities that are notpublicly traded in the United States, but would cover securities that arepublicly traded outside this country. American Depository Receipts andthe underlying foreign securities would be viewed as separate classes ofsecurities for purposes of the Proposed Rule. Comment is requested as tothis proposed separate treatment. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\179\ CFR 240.15c2-7(c). This tier thus not only excludessecurities quoted in an automated inter-dealer quotation system (NASDAQ),but also those securities quoted in the ``pink sheets.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\0\ 15 U.S.C. 78f. <T3>See</T3> paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of the Proposal.In addition to being non-fungible, securities covered by the non-fungiblesecurities tier must be either non-convertible debt securities or non-convertiblepreferred stock, or be issued by a company subject to the reporting obligationsimposed under the Exchange Act.\1\\8\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\181\ <T3>See </T3>Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m,78 (d) and the rules thereunder; paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of theProposal. The current resale market for restricted securities largely involves debtand preferred stock. Such senior securities are commonly held by institutions,making resale into the retail markets less likely than with common stock.These securities also are generally issued in distinct classes or series,making it more likely that the securities can be traced in the event thatleakage does occur. The Commission requests comment on the appropriateness of including inthe non-fungible securities tier all non-convertible debt securities andnon-convertible preferred stock, including those debt or preferred securitiesthat by their subordination or other terms trade more like common equityand less like senior securities. Is the need for issuer information somuch greater in the case of non-investment grade debt and preferred stockthat the rule should be limited to the more senior securities? Alternatively,recognizing that privately placed securities may not be rated, should thistier require that the issuer have outstanding at the time of the transactionsecurities rated investment grade by one or more nationally recognizedstatistical rating organizations and that the securities offered and soldin reliance on the Rule rank <T3>pari passu </T3>or senior to the issuer's investment grade securities?In addition, common equity could be offered and sold in reliance on thenon-fungible securities tier if it were issued by a reporting company.This requirement for the availability of information assures the broadrange of institutions covered by the second tier will have access to thesame issuer information that would have been made available in a registrationstatement under the Securities Act. To be eligible, issuers must have beensubject to the reporting requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of theExchange Act for a period of at least 90 calendar days immediately precedingthe offer or sale, and have filed all reports required to be filed pursuantto those provisions for at least a year (or such shorter period that theissuer was required to file such reports).\1\\8\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\2\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of the Proposal. The criteria tobe met by the issuer are the same as those set forth in Rule 144 (17 CFR230.144 (1987). In determining whether or not the issuer has complied withthis requirement, a seller would be entitled to rely on either a writtenstatement from the issuer or statements in reports filed by the issuerwith the Commission indicating that the issuer has met this requirement.The annual report on Form 10-K (17 CFR 249.310, the quarterly report onForm 10-Q 17 CFR (249.308a), and Form 20-F (17 CFR 249.220f) (on whichannual reports are made by foreign issuers) require that the filer indicatewhether it ``(1) has filed all reports required to be filed by section13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was requiredto file such reports), and (2) has been subject to such filing requirementsfor the past 90 days.''The Commission requests comment on the appropriateness of omitting therequirement that the issuer be a reporting company in the case of debtsecurities and preferred stock. In the event that the issuer is not a reportingcompany, should the rule require that the issuer undertake either as aterm of the security or contractually to provide the holder of the security,upon request, certain basic information, such as that specified in Rule15c2-11 under the Exchange Act? \1\\8\\3\<NOTE/> Should such a requirement be imposed only for preferred stockand non-investment grade debt, since investment grade debt trades primarilyon the basis of yield and rating, rather than on publicly available information?Finally, the Commission requests comment on whether the requirements thatthe securities be issued by a reporting company or be non-convertible debtsecurities or non-convertible preferred stock are unnecessary for the protectionof the institutinal buyers covered by the non-fungible securities tier.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\3\ <T3>See supra </T3>text accompanying nn. 171.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Resale Restrictions</ITAG>As under the qualified institutional buyer tier of the proposed Rule, thenon-fungible securities tier imposes no resale restrictions. The lack ofrequired resale restrictions in the non-fungible securities tier of theRule reflects the private resale market's extensive experience with seniorsecurities, the traditionally institutional nature of the market for thosesecurities, and the ability to trace any leakage of restricted securitiesinto the retail markets where a public market does not otherwise exist.The non-fungible securities tier, like the qualified institutional buyertier, does, however, require that the seller or any person acting on itsbehalf take reasonable steps to ensure that the purchaser is aware thatthe seller may rely on the exemption from registration provided under Rule144A.\1\\8\\4\<NOTE/> Where the mandated procedure was followed, a seller wouldbe entitled to rely on the safe harbor provided by the proposed Rule, evenif the buyer subsequently offered or sold the securities in the UnitedStates in an unregistered, <T3>non-exempt </T3>transaction. If that occurred, the reselling purchaserwould violate Section 5, but not the prior holder that sold in compliancewith the safe harbor rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\4\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of the Proposal. See discussion and solicitationof comments in Section V.E.3. below concerning the adequacy of that noticeprocedure.E. The Fungible Securities Tier<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Institutional Buyers</ITAG>Eligible offerees and purchasers under the fungible securities tier ofproposed Rule 144A are the same as those under the non-fungible securitiestier.\1\\8\\5\<NOTE/> Commentators should address the questions raised with respectto eligible purchasers under the non-fungible securities tier of the proposedRule with respect to the fungible securities tier as well.\1\\8\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\5\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(3)(i) of the Proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\6\ <T3>See supra </T3>Section V.D.1.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Securities Covered</ITAG>The distinction between the securities covered by this third tier and thesecond tier is that the third tier covers non-convertible debt, non-convertiblepreferred stock and securities issued by reporting companies of a classthat is quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system or listed on a registerednational securities exchange, as well as such securities issued by open-endinvestment companies, face-amount certificate companies and unit investmenttrusts registered under section 8 of the Investment Company Act.\1\\8\\7\<NOTE/> However, any securities that could be offered or sold underthe second tier could also be traded under the third. As in the case ofthe non-fungible securities tier, the Commission requests comment on whetherthe requirements that the securities be issued by a reporting company orbe non-convertible debt securities or non-convertible preferred stock areunnecessary for the protection of the institutional buyers involved.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\7\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of the Proposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Resale Restrictions</ITAG>In contrast to the qualified institutional buyer and non-fungible securitiestiers of the proposed Rule, the fungible securities tier of the proposedRule would impose resale restrictions. Under this tier, an offer or saleof securities would be protected by the safe harbor only where made pursuantto procedures designed to prevent ``leakage'' of the securities into theretail market in such a manner as to result in an unregistered public offering.The proposed Rule would require that the seller or any person acting onits behalf take reasonable steps to prevent the purchaser of such securitiesfrom reselling the securities in the United States without registrationor an available exemption.\1\\8\\8\<NOTE/> Where precautionary procedures were implemented and followedproperly, a seller's transaction would be protected by the safe harbor,notwithstanding any subsequent <T3>non-exempt </T3>unregistered distribution by a purchaser. In such cases,the reselling purchaser would be in violation of section 5, but not theprior holder that sold in compliance with the safe harbor rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\8\ <T3>See </T3>paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of the Proposal.The Rule provides that reasonable steps to guard against an unregistered,non-exempt public offering would be conclusively established where thepurchaser agreed in writing not to resell the securities in the UnitedStates absent registration or an applicable exemption, and the securitieswere in registered (as opposed to bearer) form, and appropriately legended\1\\8\\9\<NOTE/> or subject to stop transfer instructions in the case of non-exempttransactions not registered under the Securities Act.\1\\9\\0\<NOTE/> These are traditional precautions that have been taken toguard against an unregistered public offering, particularly in the caseof common equity. These steps would provide a non-exclusive means of demonstratingcompliance with the mandated precautionary procedure. The seller's failureto take the particular steps specified in the Rule would not create a presumptionthat it had acted unreasonably. In the absence of taking the specifiedsteps, the seller would remain free to establish that reasonable stepshad been taken to prevent an unregistered distribution in the United Statesby the buyer through other means.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\9\ <T3>See </T3>17 CFR 230.502(d).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\0\ <T3>See </T3>pargraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) of the Proposal.The Commission requests comment on whether the measures proposed as conclusiveproof that the seller acted reasonably to prevent an unregistered, non-exemptdistribution are adequate. Commenters are also requested to address whetherthere are more efficient and effective means of protecting against retailleakage.An alternative method of protecting against an unregistered public offeringis to establish trading systems that limit trading to qualifying institutionsand establish depositary and clearance systems such that trades may bemade only to other such institutions. The American Stock Exchange and theNational Association of Securities Dealers both have announced plans toestablish such systems for the trading of unregistered securities.\191\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\191\ The American Stock Exchange, Inc. has proposed a domesticmarket for institutional trading of unregistered foreign securities tobe known as SITUS, for ``System for Institutional Trading of UnregisteredSecurities.'' The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. is developinga NASDAQ-type system for the trading of unregistered securities of majorforeign and domestic issuers. The NASD system will be known as PORTAL,for ``Private Offerings, Resales and Trading through Automated Linkages.''The proponents of these systems have not yet established the availabilityof exemptions from the applicable provisions of the Securities Act or theExchange Act, and this discussion should not be read to indicate that theCommission has made any determination as to the application of the provisionsof such Arts to either SITUS or PORTAL.The operating procedures for such systems have not yet been finalized.However, the Commission, as an alternative to the procedures describedabove, could deem a system to establish adequate procedures under Rule144A if it (i) provided for a deposit or book entry of securities, (ii)restricted transferees to qualifying institutions buying for their ownaccount or the account of other qualifying institutions, and (iii) limitedthe transactions allowed for exiting the closed system to those adequatelydocumented and verifiable transactions that were not subject to registrationunder the Securities Act (for example, sales made under proposed RegulationS). In addition, such system would provide adequate surveillance proceduresfor the market and the Commission to verify that such eligibility criteriawere maintained. Sellers of securities in such systems, by compliance withthe terms of such systems, could meet the requirements of Rule 144A. Theywould not be required to inquire as to the purchaser's status or obtainits written agreement to resell the securities in accordance with the Rule,as these functions would be performed through the operating proceduresof the closed system. Participation in such a system would be conditionalonly within that system or in transactions exempt from registration. TheCommission requests comments as to whether, in the case of fungible securities,it should require participation in the kind of closed trading system discussedabove, or would the resale restrictions proposed adequately protect againstan unregistered, non-exempt public offering in the United States? The procedures proposed under the third tier have not been proposed withrespect to fungible securities covered by tier 1. The distinction is basedon the premise that the qualified institutions are sufficiently sophisticatedand experienced in the trading of restricted securities to protect adequatelyagainst an illegal unregistered distribution from being effected. The Commissionrequests comment on the soundness of this premise, and on whether any ofthe resale restrictions proposed under the fungible securities tier shouldbe applied to all or some portion of the qualified institutional buyerand non-fungible securities tiers. In particular, the Commission requestscomment on the adequacy of relying on notice to the buyer that the sellermay rely on Rule 144A to assure against leakage into the public marketof fungible securities traded in the U.S. public markets, as would be permittedunder the qualified institutional buyer tier. Similarly, is such noticesufficient in the case of non-fungible common stock of reporting companies,that would be covered by the non-fungible securities tier?  <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Changes to Rule 144 and Rule 145  </ITAG>In connection with its consideration of proposed Rule 144A, the Commissionhas reexamined the principles underlying the determination of holding periodsfor purposes of Rule 144. As a result, the Commission is today proposingamendments to Rule 144's tacking concept.  While the proposed amendments to Rule 144 arose in the context of the developmentof Rule 144A, they would be applicable to all restricted securities, notonly those sold under Rule 144A. The Commission's assessment of the advisabilityand effect of the Rule 144 changes must take into account their full scope.The Commission may determine to adopt one or more tiers of proposed Rule144. Commentators therefore should address the merits of the proposalsboth independently and as a package.

The holding period condition incorporated in Rule 144 is intended to protectagainst an indirect public offering.\1\\9\\6\<NOTE/> The prohibition against tacking of a prior holder's holdingperiod derived in part from pre-Rule 144 theories pursuant to which a holdercould be deemed to have acquired restricted securities with an investmentintent rather than ``with a view to distribution.'' \1\\9\\7\<NOTE/> Finding that these theories had generated substantial uncertaintyin the application of the securities Act's registration provisions, whilefailing to assure adequate protection of investors, the Commission adoptedRule 144 to provide a more objective and certain standard for determiningwhen securities could be sold to the public without concern for the sellerbeing found to be a statutory underwriter.\1\\9\\8\<NOTE/> In 1981, paragraph (k) was added to the Rule to provide adefined holding period beyond which the previously restricted securitiescould be resold freely by non-affiliates.\1\\9\\9\<NOTE/> And, in 1983, the public information requirement was droppedfrom Rule 144(k).\2\\0\\0\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\6\ <T3>See</T3> Preliminary Note to Rule 144.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\7\ <T3>See</T3> Section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b(11)).<T3>See also In Re The Crowell-Collier Publishing Co., </T3>SecuritiesAct Release No. 3825 (Aug. 12, 1957) (``one evidentiary fact'' to be consideredin ascertaining whether a purchaser took with investment intent, ratherthan with the intent to distribute that would render him a statutory underwriter,is the length of the period between acquisition and resale).  <ITAG tagnum="28">Prior to the adoption of Rule 144, the Commission focused on two factorsin ascertaining whether a holder of unregistered securities had purchasedwith the requisite investment intent: (1) The length of time the securitieswere held, as determined by the holder's execution of an ``investment letter''on the date of purchase containing the assertion that he was not takingthe securities with a view to their later distribution, but instead intendedto hold them for investment (</ITAG><T3>see, e.g., Riker-Maxson Corp. </T3>(avail.

As a result of its reexamination of the resale issue, the Commission todayis proposing to amend Rule 144 to permit holders of securities acquiredin a transaction or chain of transactions not involving any public offeringto include the holding period of prior unaffiliated holders. The proposedchanges to Rule 144 would apply to securities acquired in reliance uponproposed Rule 144A as well as to other restricted securities. Requiringsecurities to be held for two years by each successive holder before permittingRule 144 resales, without regard to the time elapsed from the date of thesale of the security by the issuer or an affiliate, appears to be unnecessarilyrestrictive. A single period running from the date of the purchase fromthe issuer or its affiliate would appear sufficient to prevent the distributionof restricted securities to the public.Rule 144(d)(1) thus is proposed to be amended to allow the two-year periodprescribed therein to run continuously from the acquisition of restrictedsecurities from the issuer, or from any affiliate thereof, until the subsequentresale of the securities by either the initial holder or a subsequent holder.Because of its ``issuer'' status for purposes of the rule,\201\<NOTE/> an affiliate's resale of securities acquired at some pointin a chain of transactions occurring within two years of a non-affiliate'sacquisition of such securities from the issuer or an affiliate will triggerthe commencement of a new period.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\201\For purposes of Rule 144, an affiliate of an issuer ``isa person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, such issuer.''Rule 144(a)(1). <T3>See</T3> Rule 405 (17 CFR 230.405). Section 2(11) of the SecuritiesAct defines the term ``issuer'' to include an affiliate of the issuer.Accordingly, any person purchasing from an affiliate may be deemed a statutoryunderwriter.As proposed, Rule 144(k) similarly would be amended to permit a non-affiliate,who has been a non-affiliate for at least three months, to resell restrictedsecurities free of the restrictions imposed by paragraphs (c), (e), (f),and (h) of Rule 144 if a period of at least three years, as computed inaccordance with paragraph (d) of the rule, had elasped since the laterof the date the securities originally were acquired from the issuer orthe date they were acquired from an affiliate of the issuer.Comment is sought, first, regarding the impact on the secondary privatemarkets for debt and equity securities, respectively, of the present generalrule barring tacking by successive purchasers of such securities, and second,the anticipated consequences to such markets of the proposed amendments.Commentators should identify, to the extent possible, the particular effectof such change on sales to non-institutional investors. Commentators alsoshould address the impact of the adoption of Rule 144A if the current baron tacking is retained.As under existing Rule 144, where the initial acquisition is a sale, thetwo-year period would not begin to run until the full purchase price hadbeen paid by the person acquiring the securities from the issuer or anaffiliate of the issuer.\202\<NOTE/> Likewise perpetuating the requirements of the present Rule,amended subdivision (d)(2) of the rule would provide that payment for thesecurities acquired from the issuer or an affiliate by means of a promissorynote, other obligation or installment contract would not be deemed fullconsideration unless specific conditions were met.\203\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\202\Proposed paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 144.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\203\Proposed paragraph (d)(2) of Rule 144.Consistent with the focus of the revised approach to determination of theperiod required prior to the resale of restricted securities in relianceupon Rule 144's safe harbor, the Commission is proposing to rescind existingRule 144(d)(3). Proposed subdivisions (d)(1) and (k) would provide fora single two or three year period running from the date of acquisitionfrom the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer. Under such an approach,the question whether the initial or any subsequent holder sold short orotherwise held a contingent position in restricted securities is irrelevant,provided the person acquiring the securities from the issuer or an affiliateof the issuer paid full consideration for the securities and the prescribedperiod had run. The Commission seeks comment on any potential adverse orbeneficial effects of the rescission of Rule 144(d)(3), if any, on institutionaland non-institutional participants in the secondary private markets. As discussed, the two and three year periods established by proposed Rule144(d)(1) and proposed amended Rule 144(k) would begin anew for personsacquiring securities from an affiliate of the issuer. Exceptions to thisgeneral rule would be preserved expressly in proposed Rules 144(d)(3)(iv)through (vii) \204\<NOTE/> for the benefit of persons taking securities from an affiliatedpledgor, donor, trust settler or deceased person.\205\<NOTE/> The existing Rule enables a holder of securities to combinewith his own holding period, the holding period of either an affiliatedor a non-affiliated transferor under those circumstances. By contrast withthe ``sale'' transactions contemplated by existing and proposed Rule 144(d)(1),pursuant to which an affiliate seller's holding period may not be tackedto that of the buyer, there is an identity of interest between a transfereewho acquires securities in what the Commission traditionally has consideredto be a non-sale transaction. Regardless of whether the transferor in sucha non-sale transaction is an affiliate or non-affiliate of the issuer,the transferee should be permitted to avail himself of the holding periodsof his respective transferor. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\204\ Present Rules 144(d)(4)(iv) through (d)(4)(vii) (17CFR 230.144(d)(4)(iv) through (d)(4)(vii)). Rule 144(d)(4) would be renumberedas 144(d)(3) if the Commission rescinds existing Rules 144(a)(3) as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\205\ <T3>See supra</T3> n. 194 The proposed revisions to Rules 144(d)(1) and (k) render such provisionsunnecessary for transferees of a non-affiliate. Under paragraphs (d)(3)(iv) through (vii), the holding period of an affiliate's pledgee, donee,trust or estate similarly would continue to relate back to the date ofacquisition by the affiliate. As under current paragraph (d)(3)(vii), thetwo and three year periods would not be required for estates and beneficiariesthereof that are not affiliates of the issuer. Paragraphs (c), (f), (g),(h) and (i) of the Rule would continue to apply to securities sold by suchpersons in reliance upon Rule 144's safe harbor in less than three years.Comment is sought as to the continuing validity of the Commission's positionregarding tacking of holding of securities acquired from an affiliatedpledgor, donor, settlor or deceased individual. Commentators should addressthe merits of the Commission's view of proposed (d)(3)(iv) through (d)(3)(vii)\206\<NOTE/> transactions, and of the possibility that the different treatmentof affiliates engaged in such transactions would give rise to a distributionof restricted securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\206\ Present Rules 144(d)(4)(iv) through (d)(4)(vii) (17CFR 230.144(d)(4)(iv) through (d)(4)(vii)). Currently, the acquisition or securities pursuant to a transaction of thetype specified in Rule 145(a) is considered a purchase from the issuerfor purposes of Rule 144.\207\<NOTE/> Proposed subdivision (d)(3)(viii) makes it clear, consistentwith this view, that the two and three year periods established by Rules144 (d) and (k) and incorporated in Rule 145(d) would commence runningon the date the holder is deemed to have acquired the securities in a Rule145(a) transaction. Proposed Rule 145(d) would provide for the resale bysuch person or party of the securities thus acquired after a period oftwo or three years as computed under amended Rules 144(d) or (k). Finally,an exception set forth in new Rule 144(d)(3)(viii) would codify the staff'sinterpretation position that a transaction effected solely for the purposesof forming a holding company will be deemed a ``recapitalization'' withinthe meaning of existing Rule 144(d)(4)(i); \208\<NOTE/> therefore, the holding period of the holding company's securitiesis tacked to that of the predecessor operating company's securities.\209\<NOTE/> In determining whether a transaction is solely for the purposesof forming a holding company, the analysis outlined in the<T3> Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy andamp; Gardner Capital Corp.</T3> letterwould be followed. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\207\ 17 CFR 230.145(a). As explained in the Preliminary Noteto Rule 145, persons who are offered securities in business combinationsof the following types may avail themselves of the safe harbor availableunder the Rule: (1) Reclassification, other than a stock split, reversestock split or change in par value, that involves the substitution of onesecurity for another; (2) merger or consolidation; and (3) transfer ofassets in consideration of the issuance of securities under certain conditions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\208\ Proposed Rule 144(d)(3)(i).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\209\ <T3>See Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy andamp; Gardner Capital Corp.,</T3> [1987-1988Transfer Binder] Fed.

Comment is sought on the continuing applicability of the non-tacking principalproposed to be codified in Rule 144(d)(3)(viii), as well as codificationof the exception to the principle that is proposed in this new subdivision.The proposed amendments to Rule 144 are intended only to establish thecommencement date for determining the two and three year periods, and donot change the required aggregation of the seller's and buyer's sales indetermining compliance with the volume limitations prescribed by Rule 144(e)(2).\210\<NOTE/> If the transaction, while denoted as a purchase acquisition,were found in substance to be a transaction specified in paragraphs (d)(3)(iv) through (vii) of the Rule, as proposed to be amended, the substanceof the transaction would govern and the applicable aggregation principlesset forth in Rule 144(e) therefore would apply. Where two or more affiliatesor other persons agree to act in concert for the purpose of selling restrictedsecurities, aggregation also may be required under Rule 144(e)(3)(vi).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\210\ 17 CFR 230.144(e)(2). <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Cost-Benefit Analysis</ITAG>To evaluate fully the benefits and costs associated with proposed Rule144A, the Commission requests commenters to provide views and data as tothe costs associated with private resales under current law as comparedto such estimated costs under the proposed Rule. In this regard, the Commissionnotes that the proposed Rule should facilitate resales by providing a ruleto accommodate existing practice. The Commission also requests commentersto provide views and data regarding the costs and benefits of the proposedRule to issuers of securities, institutional and other investors and thetrade markets.By providing clearer guidance as to the applicability of the SecuritiesAct registration provisions, the proposed Rule should increase the marketabilityof unregistered securities sold and thus result in reduced capital-raisingcosts to issuers, since a deeper secondary market should enable them toobtain more favorable prices for their securities. In addition, purchasersand sellers should benefit from the increased liquidity provided by thissecondary market.As the proposed Rule sanctions certain existing practices, is non-exclusive,and does not impose any record keeping or reporting requirements, the Commissionis not aware of any additional costs that would result from the proposal.The Commission also requests commenters to provide views and data on thecosts associated with resales under Rule 144 and Rule 145 as presentlyin force and as proposed to be amended. As the proposed amendments wouldnot require any different procedures for resale, and would allow resalesto be made under Rule 144 sooner than is presently the case in many instances,the Commission does not anticipate any additional costs to result fromthe proposed amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</ITAG>This initial regulatory flexibility analysis relates to proposed new Rule144A and amendments to Rules 144 and 145 under the Securities Act of 1933(``Securities Act''), and has been prepared in accordance with the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.\211\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\211\ 5 U.S.C. 603.A. Reasons for Proposed ActionThe Commission is proposing Rule 144A because it appears that, in certaincircumstances, specified institutional investors may not need the protectionof the registration provisions of the Securities Act. Further, registrationin such circumstances may impose undue burdens on the parties to thesetransactions. If this Rule is adopted, a more efficient market for resalesto institutional investors should develop.The Commission is proposing to amend Rules 144 and 145 to provide a moreequitable means of determining the period for which restricted securitiesmust be held before public resale is protected by the rules. The effectof these changes would be that restricted securities could be sold subjectto certain conditions after two years from the date of their acquisitionfrom an issuer or an affiliate thereof, and would be freely resalable threeyears after such acquistion.B. ObjectivesThe proposed Rule 144A is intended to provide a nonexclusive safe harborfrom the registration requirements of the Securities Act for resales ofsecurities to institutional investors. The proposed Rule includes threetiers. The first (the ``qualified institutional buyer tier'') would allowresales of any securities to institutions with assets of $100 million ormore. The second (the ``non-fungible securities tier'') would permit unlimitedresales of restricted securities of a class not publicly traded in theUnited States to specified institutions of a smaller size, provided thesecurities to be offered or sold were non-convertible debt securities ornon-convertible preferred stock, or securities of an issuer reporting underthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The third tier (the ``fungible securitiestier'') would allow unlimited resales of restricted securities of a classpublicly traded in this country, if the securities were non-convertibledebt securities, non-convertible preferred stock, or securities of a reportingcompany. In addition, the fungible securities tier would require that theseller take reasonable steps to guard against an unlawful distributionin the United States by the purchaser.The proposed changes to Rule 144 (and thus, Rule 145) would have the effectof enabling holders of restricted securities to ``tack'' the holding periodof sellers other than the issuer or affiliates of the issuer of the securities.Currently, Rule 144 permits the public resale of restricted securitieswhen certain conditions, including a minimum holding period of two years(Rule 144(d)(1)) or three years (Rule 144(k)), are met. Tacking generallyis not permitted in calculating Rule 144 holding periods. Rule 145 in turnpermits public resales of securities issued in certain business combinations,provided in part that mimimum holding periods prescribed by Rule 144 haverun.Under the proposed amendments to Rule 144, the two or three year periodfor restricted securities, including securities acquired meeting the requirementsof Rule 144A, would commence at the time the securities were acquired ordeemed to have been acquired from the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer.Thus, the periods imposed by Rule 144 would run continuously from the initialacquisition of restricted securities to the resale of such securities twoor three years later by either the holder or a subsequent holder. Onlyan affiliate's acquisition and resale of the securities, at some pointin a chain of transactions occurring during the running of the period,would trigger the commencement of a new holding period for any person takingfrom such affiliate. Because Rule 145 holding periods are determined byreference to Rule 144, Rule 145 would be amended to reflect the proposedamendments to Rule 144.C. Legal BasisRule 144A and the amendments to Rules 144 and 145 are being proposed bythe Commission pursuant to sections 2(11), 4(1), 4(3) and 19(a) of theSecurities Act.\2\\1\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\2\ 15 U.S.C. 77b(11), 77d(1), 77d(3), and 77s(a).D.Small Entities Subject to the RuleThe Commission has adopted definitions of the term ``small entity'' forthe various entities subject to Commission rulemaking. When used with referenceto an ``Issuer,'' other than an investment company, the term is definedby Rule 157 \2\\1\\3\<NOTE/> under the Securities Act as an issuer whose total assetson the last day of its most recent fiscal year were $5,000,000 or lessand that is engaged or proposing to engage in an offering of securitieswhich does not exceed $5,000,000. The Commission has no data on the numberof such small entities that would be affected by proposed Rule 144A, andan estimation of such number is not currently feasible. However, during1987, about 750 small issuers engaged in public offerings of $5,000,000or less. If the non-fungible securities or fungible securities tier ofproposed Rule 144A were ultimately adopted, the Rule 144A might affectsmall issuers disproportionately. The Rule would not be available for theresale of common equity securities issued by most small issuers. Therefore,the effect of the Rule could be to ease certain burdens for larger ratherthan small entities with respect to resales covered by the Rule. To theextent that small issuers are directly affected by the proposed Rule, however,the Rule's enhancement of the liquidity of the private secondary marketsshould make it easier for such issuers to sell securities in that market.If the qualified institutional buyer tier ultimately were adopted, smallissuers would not be disproportionately affected by Rule 144A, as thattier is not limited to debt securities, preferred stock and securitiesissued by reporting issuers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\3\ 17 CFR 230.157.As regards broker-dealers subject to the proposed Rule, Rule 0-10(c) underthe Exchange Act \2\\1\\4\<NOTE/> indicates that a ``small entity'' or ``small organization''for the purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act shall mean a brokeror dealer that (1) had total capital of less than $500,000 on the datein the prior fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements wereprepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d) \2\\1\\5\<NOTE/> or if it is not required to file such statements, a brokeror dealer that had total capital of less than $500,000 on the last businessday of the preceding fiscal year, and (2) is not affiliated with any personthat is not a small business or small organization as defined in this section.The Commission has no data on the number of such small entities or organizationsthat would be affected by proposed Rule 144A, and an estimation of suchnumber is not currently feasible. However, as of the end of 1987, approximately7,233 broker-dealers were small entities or organizations as defined bythis rule. Small entities that are broker-dealers generally would be affectedby the proposed Rule 144A in the same way as other investment firms.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\4\ 17 CFR 240.0-10(c).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\5\ 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d).The proposed Rule 144A may affect small businesses that are institutionalinvestors. To the extent that these investors are affected by the proposedRule, the Rule should make it easier for them to resell privately placedsecurities principally due to the improved liquidity of this market. However,the qualified institutional buyer tier of the proposal would provide awider safe harbor to institutional investors having total assets in excessof $100 million.The proposed amendments to Rules 144 and 145 are expected to reduce thecosts associated with sales of restricted securities by small and largeissuers alike. As stated above, the Commission has no data on the numberof such small entities or organizations that would be affected by the proposedamendments, and an estimation of such number is not currently feasible.E. Reporting, Recordkeeping and other Compliance RequirementsRule 144A, if adopted, would provide a safe harbor from the registrationprovisions of the Securities Act, and thus may result in the filing offewer registration statements under that Act. If so, adoption of the Rulemay result in decreased reporting, recordkeeping, and other complaincerequirements with respect to transactions covered by the Rule.The amendments to Rules 144 and 145 would have no significant effect onreporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements.F. Overlapping or Conflicting Federal RulesIt does not appear that the proposed Rule 144A and the proposed amendmentsto Rules 144 and 145 duplicate, overlap, or conflict with any existingFederal Rule.G. Significant AlternativesProposed new Rule 144A and the amendments to Rules 144 and 145 are intendedto benefit all issuers, regardless of size, by providing clarificationof the circumstances in which resales of securities made to institutionalinvestors may be made without registration under the Securities Act. A possible alternative to the proposed Rule 144A and the amendments toRules 144 and 145 might include the establishment of differing complianceor reporting requirements for small entities. Such an alternative, however,based only on the size of the issuer and no other criteria, would not beconsistent with the goal of the Securities Act to protect investors. Furtherclarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reportingrequirements under the regulation for small entities also would not beappropriate. The proposed Rule and the amendments are themselves a clarificationand simplification of compliance and reporting requirements, and additionalsimplification for small entities would not be consistent with the Commission'sstatutory mandate.Another alternative could be the adoption of performance rather than designstandards with regard to resales and holding periods for such resales.Use of performance rather than design standards in a safe-harbor contextwould frustrate the ability of persons relying on Rule 144A and the amendmentsto Rules 144 and 145 to ascertain whether all the conditions for meetingthe safe harbor were satisfied. An exemption from the provisions of theregulation for small entities would exclude such entities from coverageof the safe harbor. Application of the Rule and the amendments to bothlarge and small entities is consistent with the Commission's mandate.An alternative to the amendments to Rules 144 and 145 could be the eliminationof all holding periods for resales of restricted securities. However, itappears that a period of two years (Rule 144(d)(1)) or three years (Rule144(k)) is necessary to prevent the distribution of restricted securitiesfrom affecting the market for publicly-held securities of the issuer.H. Solicitation of CommentsThe Commission encourages the submission of written comments with respectto any aspect of this initial regulatory flexibility analysis. Such writtencomments will be considered in the preparation of the final regulatoryanalysis if the proposed Rule is adopted.
