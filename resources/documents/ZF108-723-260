This year, twogroups are attempting to create two vastly different marketplaces overcomputer networks.andP;  Both are entering new territory: in the United States,American Information Exchange (AMIX), a competitive online market for marketresearch and custom consulting services; and in the Soviet Union,InterImpulse, distribution of imported goods to workers through Mac-basedcatalogues and order systems in their factories.andM;In centralized systems, consumers consume and producers produce, butconsumers play little role in allocating resources.andP;  That's left up to thestate - or, in the case of traditional online services, to market plannerswho decide what information products to offer.andP;  In both cases, the organizingbodies certainly try to take consumer desires into account, but they haveless incentive than consumers themselves to do so: Since prices are fixed allthey can do is notice what is purchased and what is not.andP;  In the SovietUnion, almost anything that's available is purchased, except for defectivegoods such as rotten meat or a surplus of size-13 shoes, so consumer behavioris a fallible guide: Basically, it just says MORE !andP;  But the reaction timesof market planners are slow, and prices don't adjust to adjust to reflecteither costs or demand.andP;  The deleterious effects of a command system are notimmediately visible, since a well-designed central system operateseffectively at first.andP;  But in the end it fails to change effectively inresponse to changing conditions.andP;  Thus the lack of a market ultimatelyaffects not just the allocation of goods, but the allocation of investment innew goods and innovation.andM;Both AMIX and InterImpulse will grow, we believe, since they can use andallocate resources more effectively than the economically sterile systemsaround them.andP;  Just as a plant sucks nourishment from air and ground to buildmore plants, so will these systems take resources from the economy aroundthem and transform them into living economic matter.andM;American Information Exchange will implement the rules of the market insidean online information system, with pilot operations planned for next winter.andO;AMIX will support buyers and sellers in negotiating pricing, unlike otheronline systems, which are distribution mechanisms with pricing generallydetermined outside the system in bytes or minutes  - a way that doesn'treflect the precise value of the specific information delivered.andM;Phil Salin, 40, who started the company in 1984, has been formulating thisidea since 1970, when he was studying the economics of information andtransaction costs at UCLA while reading Friedrich Hayek on localdecision-making and Karl Popper on the evolution of knowledge  - all thewhile working as a time-sharing system operator to pay the bills.andP;  It wasonly after a Stanford MBA, and jobs as a stockbroker and in the LotusChairman's Randamp;D Group (organized by Mitchell Kapor) and in the space industry,that he saw the costs of pcs and online services come down to the point wherethe idea made practical sense.andP;  In 1988 Autodesk bought 80 percent of thecompany (the rest is owned by employees), but Autodesk, which develops andsells software, is now attempting to find an additional investor to share thedifferent kind of effort and considerable cost of implementing an onlineservice.andM;AMIX's initial market is people likely to be online already  - sellers andbuyers of  computer information and consulting services.andP;  AMIX will let themnegotiate with one another, with specific prices and specs.andP;  The informationneedn't be static data or market analyses, but customized marketing plans orplug-your-data-in models or services.andP;  And it may not exist at all unlessit's asked for.andP;  For example, a buyer might send a seller his data to loadinto the seller's proprietary spreadsheet; the seller sends back the resultswithout the formulas and data he uses.andP;  Or a seller might sell a DecisionPadmatrix of product specs into which the buyer could plug his own buyingcriteria.andP;  Vendors can also offer custom services  - a report plus one hourof telephone consultation, say.andP;  Or they could offer to develop a marketingplan for a product described by an information buyer.andP;  In addition, a lot ofinformation will be offered as is but in chunks, with buyers able to select,say, four chapters from a longer report or extra detail on certain suppliersoff a menu supplied by the vendor.andM;Greasing the channels of information flowandM;Says Salin:  We're just trying to reduce the friction and transaction coststhat keep people from trading their knowledge for gain.&quot; Or as one potentialinvestor puts it,  Think of a user group [bulletin board] where people hadincentives to participate.&quot; On occasion AMIX will lose a commission streamwhen a buyer and a seller decide to establish a permanent relationshipoutside the market.andP;  But long-term relationships are precisely where AMIX isnot needed (or economically justified).andP;  Its value is in helping theformation of relationships and the continuing matching of ad-hoc needs-not incollecting a toll on the flow of information in established channels.andP;  Forthat matter, the actual information products offered could be mailed ordelivered by telephone.andP;  Unlike other online services, AMIX is focused on thetransactions more than the delivery of the information.andM;Overall, a competitive market should lower the price of custom information.andO;More significantly, it should also raise the quality and increase the amountand variety of it sold.andP;  The most important thing about the market is not somuch its ability to allocate resources as its ability to foster theircreation (see page 7) by allowing would-be buyers to make their voices heardwidely.andP;  Rather than just let buyers filter information, AMIX will let themtake a real-time part in determining what information should be there.andM;Until now, without an efficient marketplace for publication of specificsupply and demand information, it hasn't been cost-effective to offeranything but mass-produced information on a broad scale.andP;  Instead, a customercould always negotiate with a supplier he knew for a given study or analysisor custom service, but there was little competitive pressure on the localsupplier's price  - and meanwhile, the customer was probably not able to findthe best person in the field.1 In addition to encouraging the production ofcustom research, AMIX will also induce contributions from new sellers -people who would find it too much trouble to go into business in a big waybut who have some specific expertise to contribute if they could only findthe people who need it.andP;  Finally, AMIX may result in less irrelevantinformation going to people who don't need it.andM;The specsandM;Access to AMIX is through traditional dial-up, Tymnet or whatever one's locallink may be.andP;  The service runs off a UNIX server (Suns for now), and suppliesusers with client software for PCs and Macs.andP;  The server maintains profilesand information on each seller, including comments from buyers, handlesaccounting and billing for vendors and buyers, and manages the informationresources.andP;  Fundamentally, it's a more-or-less hierarchical topic space, withample cross-references and multiple classifications that make it easy forbuyers to find what they want.andP;  The hypertext linking features also make iteasy for the information to be kept up-to-date and for inconsistencies (orsecond opinions!) to be noted if not resolved.andM;The client software, written in C for portability, handles each user'sprofile, allow composition of requests for information or comments by buyersand preparation of advertising and information products by sellers.andP;  Thefront-end offers menus and tree structures, and lets buyers store queries andcreate their own cross-references.andP;  It also maintains the links among thedocuments and information purchased and downloaded, so that buyers needn'treconnect to the host to benefit from the system's extensive cross-referencesand updates.andM;Within the database, each topic contains a norm of 40 to 50 items, and issplit into subtopics when it approaches 100.andP;  The items are the productsoffered for sale, indexed by author, title, publisher, etc.andP;  Each topic alsocontains the names of consultants who wish to be listed there, and a list ofthe subtopics.andP;  A buyer can search the usual way by keywords within a numberof fields such as author name or company, price, date, etc.andP;  But he can alsomove through the topic hierarchy and scan attached comments or linked items.andO;The vendor, the AMIX market manager or buyer/commenters can add comments orlinks crossing branches in the hierarchy, such as &quot;See also such and such areport&quot; or  Juan Tigar has studied this issue in depth&quot; with pointers to theappropriate texts elsewhere.andM;A buyer can start with a simple topic search, and refine his query.andP;  Or hecan simply publish a question, and consultants looking for work will rush tooffer him answers at the prices they choose.andP;  There are facilities to keepbuyers apprised of new documents or information experts that match theircriteria, and of pricing changes or additional information for documents theyhave expressed interest in.andP;  All these arrangements seem reasonable enough,although we're sure they'll change over time.andP;  (The market adjust)andM;New! Improved! Now with 40% more data !andP;  Now of course, it may be difficulteven for a prospective customer to value intellectual property.andP;  The trick isto let the consumers and vendors handle the complexities of pricing andvaluing the information themselves.andP;  In a sense, AMIX is also an advertisingmedium: not just information to sell, but information about the informationon sale.andP;  AMIX allows sellers to describe their products, offer free trials,sneak previews or whatever else they want.andP;  Since information is not acommodity, it's up to the vendors to differentiate their products, supplyingas much (true) information as possible to persuade buyers to purchase, and intheir interest to do so.andP;  (2)andM;What keeps sellers honest? AMIX also provides feedback facilities(implemented as links to comments by customers): Customers are invited tocomment on the services or products they purchase for the benefit of otherpotential purchasers, but they must identify themselves to do so.andP;  No vendormay delete those comments, although he may respond to them.andP;  And of coursethe meta-information isn't limited to advertising: If you wanted to offer,say, &quot;A User's Guide to AMIX&quot; or even  Alice's Assessments&quot; about informationon the system and charge for it, that would be fine too.andM;Government for the marketandM;There are some simple rules.andP;  AMIX collects a percentage of each transactionfrom the seller, as well as storage fees for keeping his offered informationonline.andP;  A vendor may offer his information in as many categories as hepleases for no extra charge (although a charge may be instituted when thingsget crowded).andP;  If the stuff doesn't sell, the overhead charges eventuallyinduce the seller to remove the product.andP;  The buyer pays connection charges,plus whatever price he agrees on for the information he purchases.andM;The goal is to have the system organize itself as sellers and buyersgravitate to the proper topic areas and prices respond to demand andcompetition; sellers as well as buyers can see what else is being offered, ofcourse.andM;But even markets need extra-market forces to maintain  common sense,&quot; keeporder and decide and enforce the rules.andP;  Aside from integrity and accountingrules enforced by the software, AMIX has market managers, akin to bulletinboard sysops or local cops who know the neighborhood and can keep order andarbitrate most disputes without resorting to bureaucracy.andM;AMIX's market managers decide when a particular topic area needsspecialization into sub-topics, or when a topic is of so little interest thatit needs to be merged into a larger subject.andP;  A market manager can also gooutside the system to recruit suppliers for topic areas that seemunderserved.andP;  (3)andM;Old ideas sell better?andM;Why has a system like AMIX been so long in coming? Because, goes theconventional wisdom, it's impossible to fix the value of intellectualproperty.andP;  Take the well-known conundrum: You search for three days and findno information on someone  - information that's extremely valuable because itmeans the individual has committed no crimes.andP;  Or another: A single articleleads you to make a stock purchase that nets you a 40 percent return in twodays.andP;  Or you download five articles, and find that four of them repeat thecontent of the first.andP;  Juan's common knowledge is Alice's electrifyingdiscovery.andM;Moreover, common wisdom has it that the supply of information is infinite:Once it is created, it can be replicated almost costlessly.andP;  There are twofallacies here: One, it may be cheap to duplicate, but it is still costly forthe seller to publicize and describe and for the buyer to find; and two, themost valuable information tends to be that which is not widely available -either because it is timely or because it is of intense interest to only afew people.andP;  So the parameters are a little different, but the general rulesof supply and demand still apply.andM;But is intellectual property so different?andP;  What's a pair of fancy shoes,size 7, &quot;Jungle&quot; style, worth? On Fifth Avenue, or in an outlet store off aninterstate in New Jersey? In June, or at season's end? The answer's simple:Let the market decide.andP;  Offer the goods and see if anyone buys.andM;Vendors will be able to offer their services at low risk over AMIX to a widermarket than they could hope to reach directly, and people such as us couldfind purchasers for each month's topics rather than hunt for the few peopleinterested in an eclectic mix of Eastern Europe, AI, text management, etc.andO;As it is, some people are paying extra for information they don't want, whileothers are missing information they do want because the whole package is tooexpensive (or because they don't know it's available).andP;  As a vendor, weconsider this an exciting marketing vehicle.andM;All this sounds like the beginnings of hypertext publishing (as described inRelease 1.0, 89-7).andP;  Indeed, this is what AMIX is.andP;  Salin has been an advisorfor years to Xanadu, the company founded by Ted Nelson and Roger Gregory tobuild a hypertext server system and turn Nelson's ideas into reality.andP;  For avariety of reasons, Xanadu has been more public about its aims and morevisible than AMIX.andP;  As it happens, AMIX first attracted Autodesk's attentionthrough Xanadu: Salin met Autodesk's John Walker during Autodesk'sacquisition of an 80 percent interest in Xanadu.andM;Luckily for Xanadu, its project has a spin-off in technology that will beused to manage AutoCAD data.andP;  But AMIX as yet has no immediate relation tothe CAD market (although there is no reason it couldn't operate, say, in thearchitecture market, with consultants offering building designs, solutions topesky plumbing problems, landscape management tips, demographic surveys).andO;Thus Autodesk is now trying to find a purchaser of part of its 80 percent,$3-million investment in AMIX who is also willing to put in the extra fundsneeded (according to the new plan) to carry the project to profitability.andO;That could be as much as $6 million, but it could be much less if the newpartner already has customers and channels for marketing online information.andO;Perhaps this new partner's offerings could be folded into the AMIX market aswell.andM;AMIX is now circulating a business plan  - and has agreed to be discussed inthis newsletter.andP;  You'd think something so ideologically in tune withcapitalism would have little trouble in finding backing, but new ideas, likeintellectual property in general, are hard to value ...andM;In fact, AMIX has the usual tortuous history of innovation.andP;  When Autodeskfirst signed on for the project in June 1988, the plan was to come out with acorporate, no-prices version first  - an online text database system of thekind proliferating today.andP;  Eventually, Autodesk correctly concluded that whatmade AMIX most special was its pricing philosophy (not the algorithms or textmanagement or friendly interface).andP;  So the project was recast in March 1989,but the investment required for a service as opposed to boxed software wasfar greater, and the time to profitability will be longer.andM;Hence the search for additional outside funding.andP;  As Autodesk president AlGreen says,  We still-believe in it; we're not trying to cut it loose.andP;  Wedon't want to sell our interest, just dilute it.&quot; Weld be skeptical of suchclaims in most cases, but Autodesk has preset spending limits for its outsideinvestments,4 and AMIX has exceeded them.andP;  The trick now is for AMIX itselfto establish its value in the broader market for intellectual property wherepeople are buying whole companies and market visions rather than justresearch reports.andM;Except for a title of questionable appeal, &quot;Bionomics: The inevitability ofcapitalism&quot; looks to be one of the more interesting books this year (thisfall, from Henry Holt).andP;  It reflects and furthers a subtle but major shift inthinking now occurring  - from seeing living things and organizations asmachines, to seeing collections of machines and people as living things.andP;  Allare animated by information: &quot;Bionomics describes the ecosystem and theeconomy as separate, parallel domains of evolving information.andP;  Geneticinformation...andP;  is the basis of all life.andP;  Technical information, captured inbooks, blueprints, scientific journals, databases, and the know-how ofmillions of individuals, is the source of all economic life ...andP;  geneticvariation and natural selection [are] phenomena similar to technicalinnovation and market competition.&quot; Building intelligently on the works ofeveryone from Darwin to Stephen J.Gould and E.O.andP;  Wilson (with some flavor ofthe Santa Fe Institute thrown in (see Release 1.0, 89-6), author MichaelRothschild argues that only constant evolution fostered by market competitionkeeps economies growing and innovating.andM;His thesis is that capitalism is not an ism  - an ideology.andP;  Rather, likeDarwinism, it is a (correct) theory of how the world works.andP;  Of course, manypeople still consider Darwinism an ideology, and an offensive one at that.andO;Writes Rothschild (formerly with the Boston Consulting Group but best knownto us as the husband of industry consultant and former Broderbund marketingvp Leigh Marriner): &quot;Having only recently reconciled ourselves [to being]descended from apes, we must now consider that even in our technological andeconomic lives  - the aspect of human culture that so sharply distinguishesus from all other species  - we are part of a larger evolutionary unfolding.andO;Because our brains happened to evolve the capacity to read and write, to dealwith coded information, we became the living bridge between genetic andtechnological information.&quot;andM;The ideological question then becomes not  Whether capitalism?&quot; but  How bestto harness its creative powers?&quot; Economies, like animals, can suffer cancerand other derangements.andP;  They also decline into old age, as noted by MichaelPorter, referring specifically to the US, heavy-consuming, low-investing waysin  The Competitive Advantage of Nations&quot; (see Release 1.0, 90-5).andO;(Unfortunately, economies and even companies rarely die, but instead lingeron in distress.andP;  How does the robber baron-to-cancer analogy play?)andM;Markets are the best way to allocate resources not for equilibrium andsatisfaction, but for maximum productivity and growth.andP;  The old notion ofequilibrium that held economists captive for so many years  - the bestpossible allocation at a point in time  - is dead.andP;  The new notion is that ofa positive-sum game over time where profits are the increment above 0 thatkeeps everything moving forward.andP;  Profit is simply a name for creation ofvalue: Someone put X resources in and gets I.1X value out.andP;  A communist willsay that O.1X represents exploitation of workers, but in fact it's the amountover maintenance (depreciation) that a fit animal earns with its skills, orworkers and investors with their know-how.andP;  In animals this surplus supportspropagation of the species; in business, investment and growth.andM;Rothschild's book may strike you as a recitation of the obvious, whilePorter's is a summation of details.andP;  But both articulate clearly perspectivesthat seem obvious only in retrospect: They make a lot of sense, so whyhaven't people been acting as if they believed these things?andM;In the West, we take free markets for granted.andP;  We don't even notice them,because they seem natural rather than some clunky machinery working to matchsupply with demand.andP;  (In the same way, you don't worry about gravity&quot;working&quot; n you pour a cup of coffee.andP;  Yes, you may spill the coffee, butbecause you poured carelessly or someone bumped the table.) We assume that ifsomething becomes popular, for whatever reason, more of it becomes available- everything from stylish sneakers to Southwest cuisine.andP;  Demand createssupply as millions of consumers signal their desire for products by buyingwhat's offered and in effect bidding up their prices, or by leaving them onthe shelves to be sold at a markdown.andP;  The market works on feedback.andM;To understand markets, it helps to see what happens without them.andP;  Verylittle.andP;  In the Soviet Union, for example, valued products sell out quickly,but no particular message gets sent back to central, preoccupied with workingon the next five-year plan.andP;  The result is that state sources of supply arefrequently pilfered and sold by clerks in the black market, where pricesswing sharply.andP;  In the end, supply meets expressed demand  - but there's nofeedback loop to the producers.andM;Fortunately, markets have a sort of life-force that makes them want to absorbthe surrounding environment  - bring more resources under their organizingcontrol.andP;  Economic players are &quot;drawn to profits much as an amoeba is luredby the taste of cyclic AMP,&quot; says Rothschild; in both cases, the substanceacts as a signal towards productive effort.andP;  Of course, governments andmonopolies have similar same urges for votes and market power.andP;  Thedifference is that the decentralized control of the market generatesdecentralized profits, whereas governments and monopolies use any surplus toconsolidate their own power.andP;  Nonetheless, because the market delivers thegoods more efficiently (literally), and because power untempered bycompetition ultimately leads to visible abuse, markets are now winning overcentral control in the metamarket of political organizations.andP;  Likewise,experiments such as AMIX and InterImpulse should grow and prosper.andM;The role of money: information and creative powerandM;Money is not so much the medium of exchange as the medium of information.andO;Money allowed local decision-making when there was no other way to trade thancumbersome physical barter.andP;  But what was once indicated by a fistful of saltor beads or paper can now as easily be manifested by a bank statement or acall (voice or e-mail) to a financial institution.andP;  Information may be keptcentrally, but decision-making remains local, with consumers.andM;In this context, money (physical or electronic) makes capitalism work becauseit is a way of expressing promises: If you build this house or give me thisgrain or work for me eight hours a day, I will give you the right to such andsuch an amount of goods.andP;  on a macro level, these promises stimulate thecreation (not just the allocation) of resources that may not already exist.andO;The role of banks in extending credit and of investors in buying equity is tojudge whose promises are credible.andP;  When promises get too expansive orgovernment money-watchers too credulous, we get inflation.andP;  Likewise, whencapitalists use their power to thwart fair competition or to direct resourcesto friends rather than credible investments, the system suffers.andP;  But theculprit here is abuse, not the market forces themselves.andM;How can computers help the soviet economy? The obvious answer is oneveryone's mind: People will use computers and software to run theirenterprises more efficiently, to make better production and marketingdecisions, to keep track of things, to get more efficient.andP;  But all thesebenefits apply to government enterprises, to helping the system as it is now.andM;Computers also have the potential to help unleash free enterprise in theSoviet Union, and to foster smaller businesses and create markets.andP;  In thisregard, computers can help free markets not through technology transfer butthrough expertise transfer.andP;  They can embody not just traditional expertsystems, but operating knowledge and techniques for tasks as simple as orderentry and distribution of goods, or as complex as marketing and demandforecasting.andP;  The wisdom and expertise embodied in software, as well as thesheer ability to handle details, can spread freely through as manyenterprises as can find computers to run the software.andP;  The Soviet governmenthas almost destroyed its human capital, but computers can help to revive it.andO;(5)andM;Moreover, the use of personal computers will enable small organizations tobenefit from many of the efficiencies achieved by larger enterprises, withoutthe offsetting inefficiencies imposed by size, bureaucracy and the lack of aprofit motive.andP;  A chief monopolist/bureaucrat argument against competition -the economies of scale and efficiency allegedly enjoyed by large governmentmonopolies  - will be overthrown by effective use of computers.andM;InterImpulse: Expertise in a MacandM;For example, as described below, computer systems embody the market-orienteddistribution system that Mariska Group hopes to plant in the Soviet Union.andO;They also fit in better with the prevailing Soviet norm that favors physicalinvestment: Don't sell me an idea; sell me a computer system.andP;  The firstshould be free; the second has a tangible value worth paying for.andP;  While welong for the day when a system such as AMIX might make sense in the SovietUnion, Mariska Group's InterImpulse is a promising start.andM;A joint venture with an arm of the Soviet Ministry of Trade, InterImpulse isslated to start operation this fall, using local Macs supported by a VAX atheadquarters in Moscow.andP;  The plan is to create a market-oriented distributionsystem for imported consumer goods within the Soviet Union, using computertechnology and distribution know-how imported from the US.andP;  If it succeeds,this supplementary channel will grow to handle not just imported goods butSoviet-produced goods.andP;  It will help factories trade with one another,competing with the cumbersome Soviet central distribution mechanism.andM;Transition to free markets: Before and afterandM;Many Soviet state enterprises are now becoming &quot;self-financing:&quot; They handletheir own financial affairs and can directly buy from and sell to otherenterprises, even foreign ones.andP;  (However, in many cases the change is onlysuperficial: Many factories simply devote 80 percent or more of production to&quot;filling state orders&quot; instead of  following state plans.&quot;) Thisself-financing is behind the Soviets' recent inability to pay their bills:Each enterprise is now directly responsible for hard-currency payments, andmany have trouble getting funds from the bureaucracy to pay their suppliers.andO;In the past, the central bank paid Western companies directly for allimports.andM;Self-financing is a move towards a market economy, but it makes it tougherfor both sides to do business, because they actually have to find each other.andO;Westerners can't simply rely on the Soviet bureaucracy to buy goods and makepayments.andP;  And now that Soviet factories buy directly, they have to findsuppliers and they no longer get the price breaks the huge centralorganizations did  - although they're more likely to get the goods they want.andO;(6)andM;The factory from which all blessings flow Each enterprise that exports (or isspecially favored) has a hard-currency account based on that activity.andP;  Inthe country as a whole, such accounts may total about $1 billion this year,down some from last year in a reflection of the Soviet economy's slide.andP;  Theenterprises can't actually pay their workers in hard currency; it's againstthe law.andP;  Still, these hard-currency accounts have the potential of adding anew dimension to the traditional state-enterprise practice of providingmotivational perks on the side - everything from deliveries of tea or sausageto holidays in Yugoslavia or sports facility membership  - and access toconsumer goods available only for hard currency.andP;  As much as half thecountry's consumer durables reaches workers through factory distributionsystems.andM;The problem is that even factories have trouble getting hold of these goods,and they don't generally respond to their workers, particular needs.andO;Instead, the factories take whatever's available  - generally the output ofanother factory with whom they have social or other non-market ties.andP;  Rightnow, any employee who got sausage or a Sony Walkman could easily trade it forsomething else, but it would be nicer to supply people's needs directly.andO;That's the story thus far.andP;  Now read on:andM;Sweat equityandM;Enter Mark Mariska, a US insurance and marketing executive and a Vietnamveteran.andP;  In the Army he had studied Russian and analyzed the Soviet Unionfor the Joint Chiefs of Staff; during that time, he wrote his master's thesison Soviet central planning and the industrial enterprise manager.&quot; In 1988,following the liberalization of Soviet trading laws, he visited the SovietUnion for the first time to assess the possibilities of directenterprise-to-enterprise trade.andM;Five trips later, in April 1989, he was ready to give up.andP;  He had made somegood friends in the Afghan veterans, movement, but the business side wasn'tgoing anywhere; the prospective partners were too academic or bureaucratic -and there were too many of them.andP;  On his way through England to Moscow forthe last time (he thought), he landed in the wake of Politburo memberAlexandra Biryukova's shopping spree; she had just bought 30 million pairs ofBritish pantyhose in the Soviet government's bid to provide consumer goods.andO;Half-heartedly, Mariska notified her of his plans, and she put him in touchwith a little-known group called Soyuzpromvnedrenie (Soyuzprom for short)within the giant Ministry of Trade.andM;The Ministry itself handles most internal trade  - about 350 billion rublesof it last year.andP;  (7)  Soyuzprom is its friendlier face  - sort of a helpdesk agency within the Ministry devoted to fostering internal trade andinnovation, taking the place of profit incentives in a system without them.andO;Suppose a factory has a surplus of size-11 shoes or a new way to polishbrass; Soyuzprom helps it to find someone who could use one or the other.andM;Site equityandM;In recent years, for example, the Ministry has spearheaded the overall pushfor conversion; Soyuzprom has helped converting military factories indeciding precisely which goods to make.andP;  Soyuzprom subscribes to cataloguesfrom around the world and knows what's possible.andP;  Instead of virtual reality,Soyuzprom has a &quot;real-reality database&quot; at its Moscow headquarters: ashowroom of consumer goods from all over  - coffee makers, shoes, handbags,children's toys, electric hair curlers, suitcases, washing machines,dishwashing liquid, etc.andP;  Factory representatives can come in to check themout and get an idea of Western quality and innovations, the manager says.andP;  Ifthey like a particular design, he is quick to point out, they can openlicensing negotiations with the original maker.andM;Soyuzprom has 20 offices throughout the country.andP;  Each has a showroom andties to Soyuzprom's local members, mostly factories, who number 20,000 inall, out of a total 40,000 government enterprises in the Soviet Union.andP;  (8)Soyuzprom's deputy director, a 42-year-old Georgian called VladislavNakashidze, took on the project with alacrity.andP;  We are the first place thefactories come to, and we want to see something happen with all thisinformation.andP;  You used to just go to one ministry, but now it'sdecentralized.andP;  We have access to the sites where decisions are being madenow,&quot; he says.andM;&quot;Nakashidze had just what our ragtag group was looking for,&quot; adds Mariska.andO;&quot;Rather than create something, we wanted to take a system that was half-thereand make it work better.&quot; The factories who now use Soyuzprom's services inproduct specification and marketing can sign up to join InterImpulse'sdistribution network and use its marketing savvy.andP;  That gives them access tothe showroom and to use of the computer catalogue system Soyuzprom will startinstalling this summer.andP;  They still have to come up with hard currency forthe imports themselves.andM;Financial equity: Old warriors keep on fightingandM;Much of the US funding comes from Don Weeden, whose Weeden and Co. is workingto raise $2 million to finance the hard-currency side of the venture goingforward.andP;  (Mariska and Weeden and friends have spent $600,000 so far.) Weedenis probably the ideal person to do this; he opened up the New York StockExchange to negotiated commissions back in the Seventies in a bruising fightthat lost him most of his sham friends on Wall Street.andP;  (9)  Weeden, moreinterested in principle than business matters, is now spending a fifth of histime counseling Mariska and talking with potential investors, although thisdeal is peanuts in the context of his firm's business.andM;The mechanicsandM;Right now, Mariska and Weeden are rounding up Western suppliers forInterImpulse.andP;  They have found a well-known maker of health and beauty aids,as well as a European consumer electronics manufacturer and a clothes-makerin the Far East.andP;  These vendors are interested in the possibility of gettingtheir brand names established early (and through legitimate channels); theyregard this entry into the Soviet Union as enough of an advantage that theydon't want their names used yet.andP;  Right now, many better-educated Sovietconsumers have heard of many of these names, but few have much experiencewith them.andP;  (Our favorite Communist brand is Stewardess cigarettes, availablefrom Bulgaria at 10 cents a pack.)andM;The American partners are providing the goods, the marketing/distributionknow-how and the computer system; Soyuzprom is supplying on-site resourcesand a distribution system; the consumer-electronics supplier will be trainingpersonnel to provide service and repairs.andM;The computers they useandM;InterImpulse will run one of the first large-scale Macintosh installations inthe country; because the country is starting computerization late, it has thechance to bypass the C-prompt.andP;  The software, developed in the US by Williamand Karl Frank of Integrated Information Systems Associates, is both adatabase of what's available, and a transaction system (the market) thatmanages inventories, consolidates factory orders, and reflects demand andsupply to both sellers and buyers.andP;  Orders will be transmitted over dial-uplines (with couriers as back-up) and consolidated at the central computer inMoscow and transmitted to the Western suppliers.andP;  Ultimately the system willsupport the All-Union Automated Trade Facility  - a pet project of bothMariska and Nakashidze and the long-term purpose of InterImpulse.andP;  The AUATFwill act as a marketplace for Soviet sellers as well as buyers, fosteringtrade both ways as well as among factories within the Soviet Union.andP;  Mariskaand Nakashidze look forward to opening actual ruble stores, with goods madeby member Soviet factories as well as imports, but first things first.andM;The system is scheduled to start operation this fall, but the VAX won't go inuntil early next year for both legal and logistical reasons.andP;  Until them, aMac in Moscow will simply serve as a consolidation point for forwarding theinformation (by phone or courier) to New York City, where the VAX willprocess the orders and send them on to suppliers.andM;The catalogue will be built with HyperCard.andP;  When it's not in use, it willrun a MacroMind Director animation showing all the wonderful thingsavailable.andP;  The system will operate in Russian (and eventually otherlanguages prevalent in some parts of the Soviet Union such as Georgian,Estonian, and Armenian), with voice instructions available via Farallon'sMacRecorder.andP;  The local sites will each have a Mac to start, on which theycan look at the goods and place orders through a simple HyperCard order-entryform; eventually the Macs will have CD-ROMs.andP;  HyperCard talks to Oracle,which runs on a Mac but will be used full-scale only on the VAX.andP;  He picked aVAX with VMS for its communication capabilities, says system designer BillFrank; otherwise he would have used UNIX on a RISC machine.andP;  But trouble-freecommunications is key to the entire operation.andM;The marketplaceandM;Soyuzprom isn't quite a monopoly, despite its ties to the Ministry of Trade.andO;(Consider it akin to one of IBM's Independent Business Units, or to Apple'sClaris.) Many Soviet government organizations are displaying the samebehavior as private corporations, attempting to expand while the market'sopen.andP;  For example, Vneshposiltorg, a government import-store operation thatlost its franchise with a change in currency regulations, has started adirect-mail operation; slow and unreliable, it is still an indication of amore competitive environment to come.andP;  In addition, a number of West Europeanretailers have started operations to sell mostly to foreigners  - mostnotably Stockmann's, the Finnish company that sends in trainloads ofeverything from toilet paper to corn flakes on a weekly basis to Westernerswho order by catalogue, sort of a long-distance grocery-that-delivers.andP;  Thenthere are Estee Lauder, Eastman Kodak and Benetton, all with shops.andP;  Butthese don't address the Soviet consumer market at large.andP;  It will be a longtime before InterImpulse has to worry about competition rather than sourcesof supply and infrastructure problems.andM;Since it all sounds so simple, why haven't 29 other people done the samething? For starters, it has taken two years to get InterImpulse registered asa joint venture.andP;  The original group of six Soviet partners, including acouple of extraneous ministries, has been whittled down to Soyuzprom and itsparent Ministry of Trade.andP;  The party apparatus is changing rapidly, asreported in the papers daily, but the government bureaucracy of ministriesand functionaries and factory managers and the like lives on.andP;  InterImpulsemay provide incentives to workers, but how does one persuade factories to useit in the first place, when they don't work on incentives, and would ratheravoid risk?andM;The plan is to use phone lines to transmit data from the offices to theMoscow center, but we suspect that many times they'll have to go by courierbecause of the country's poor telephone system, which makes it difficult totelephone distant offices.andP;  let alone transmit data to them.andP;  As forSoyuzprom's goods, the trucks will pick up goods only in containers, toreduce the endemic problem of pilferage; when the state owned everything andthe people were the state, a lot of workers felt entitled to their share ofwhatever goods they had access to  - call it self-help distribution.andM;A white marketandM;At first, worker councils and other representatives will simply order whatthey think the employees would want from abroad.andP;  This is much like a retailstore making purchasing decisions to satisfy its customers; the problem isthat there's no other retail store in town.andP;  The more progressive places maydo employee surveys or let workers look at the catalogue, but it's still onestep removed from actual customer choice until there are enough Macs tosupport general access.andM;What is the likely outcome? If the Soviet Union (not its system) flourishes,InterImpulse is likely to be one of the outfits that helps it to do so.andO;Although it's a small part of the overall economy, its operations are workingwith a multiplier effect that doesn't exist elsewhere.andP;  In other words, if itdoes its job right, it will grow productively instead of cancerously.andP;  Itsbackers will expand the number of offices and storefronts as demand grows;more products will be built and delivered, providing more funds ...andO;Theoretically, factories who provide incentives to their workers will be ableto attract better workers and produce more and better goods.andP;  It's Economics101.andM;When the factories themselves start making things to sell each other throughInterImpulse, will they sell for rubles or hard currency? In the end, itdoesn't matter; money is just data in the computer anyway.andP;  Who needs  real&quot;money when you can trade goods freely? It isn't the currency that's lacking,but the information and free markets it signifies.andP;  If the Soviet Union getsthose through InterImpulse and other such ventures, it will have hardcurrency without even trying because its goods will be worth buying.andM;POSTSCRIPT: WESTERN AIDandM;Incidentally, without start-ups like InterImpulse and many others, Westernoffers of aid won't do the Soviet people any good; they'll just help to holdthe power structure in place.andP;  It's the system the military is protecting, aswell as the military itself, that we should avoid supporting.andM;The Western hope that we can somehow send in huge chunks of aid and buildfree markets is illusory.andP;  The only way to build a free economy is from theground up.andP;  Offering large sums of money to development banks and governmentoutfits is like putting a swimming pool in a dacha garden and expecting itkeep the crops watered.andP;  Unfortunately, there is no quick or one-shot way torevive an economy; it has to be done a piece at a time.andP;  Individual bankers,investors and businesses who wish to expand operations have to go in and lookat opportunities one at a time and (yes!) make individual judgments about thecaliber of the people and situations.andP;  As even Donald Trump has shown, it'sdifficult to spend money both quickly and wisely.andM;The proper way to apply government aid, we believe, is not huge sums of moneybut just to keep out of the way  - reduce taxes and tariffs  - and perhaps tosupport some infrastructure investments such as communications facilities.andO;(Even there, better to support MCI or Contel in a joint venture with aprivate start-up than to give money to an Eastern government monopoly.) Wedon't want to insure against risk (which is impossible; you merely shift theburden), but rather encourage people to evaluate risks carefully.andP;  And then,to encourage investment, we could raise the attractiveness of the rewards ifthe investor has made the right judgments.andP;  Use the market system; don'tbypass it for illusory efficiencies.andM;When the enemy is usandM;The other problem is even tougher.andP;  How do you stop Western companies fromcoming in and supporting (government) monopolies? It's certainly a badpractice from an encouragement-of-competition point of view; it may even be abad business decision if the forces of progress prevail.andP;  Many naive Westernbusinessmen are come in thinking they have a certain industry all sewn upbecause they're dealing with the ministry for that industry.andP;  (One excitedperson told us,  This could be another CE!&quot; Another, confessing that hedidn't trust or respect the bureaucrat/businessman he was dealing with, saidhe did so anyway because of the man's power and resources.andM;Now is that being businesslike, or is it supporting what we all theoreticallyhope will be the losing team? Monopolies will be the losing team only ifenough foreign investors go in and take the trouble to find the right people- and the patience to train them.andP;  Smart investors take capability overresources: Capability can find resources, but resources without capabilityyield no return in the long run.andM;The Soviet people are used to being producers and consumers, but the job ofdeciding how much has always been left to the government; the people haven'tbeen involved in allocating resources.andP;  Their only freedom is to refuse towork hard; they can't choose to work more for more rewards; they can't reallychoose what to buy, so they opt out.andM;Nonetheless, there are pockets of competition starting up in the SovietUnion.andP;  Ministries are falling all over one another trying to expand theirturf; pieces are splitting off and agencies are getting into &quot;self-funding&quot;activities.andP;  Likewise, a number of republics are trying to bypass Moscow andtrade among themselves.andP;  All these are half-measures, but some of them arerun by smart people yearning to break free of the bureaucracy.andP;  It's worthtaking the trouble to find them.andM;1 In the same way, thousands of customers can routinely specify thefurnishings of a car and special-order it from a factory.andP;  Otherwise they'dhave to have a local dealer configure the car on a costly one-off basis.andP;  Ofcourse, it's still cheaper and quicker but less satisfying to take whateverthe dealer has around.andM;2 Just as we believe an important part of intellectual property protection isthe incentives it provides to creators to define and publicize their work.andO;Its value is realized only when potential users can find out about it and useit.andM;3 As noted in our 89-6 issue on self-organizing systems, one of theinteresting philosophical issues about self-organizing systems or markets iswhat's inside and what's outside.andP;  Do countries contain markets, or arecountries part of a larger market? See also Michael Porter's &quot;The competitiveadvantage of nations.&quot; Effective markets tend to bring their environmentsinto their sway.andP;  And in some real sense, of course, AMIX's vision ofinformation markets is in competition with more traditional views  - andimplementations.andM;4  ...andP;  designed to limit risk, they could also limit rewards.andP;  Inmarketplace terms, our own high esteem for the project means little since wedon't have the funds (or corporate charter) to back it up with an offer.andM;5 In the context that we normally cover them, computers can provide the focusfor Soviet businesses that design, sell and support software.andP;  Thesecompanies are building the infrastructure of the Soviet Union  - but unlikemost infrastructure investors, they do not require huge start-up funds.andP;  Theycan be a significant model for the new economy  - low-cost,informagtion-based enterprises that contribute to future productivity, not topresent consumption.andP;  They also exploit a resource the Soviet Union has inabundance  - the intelligence and education of its citizens.andM;6 In the same way, in the computer business, it's simplest to buy everythingfrom a single vendor.andP;  But recently customers have been discovering thebenefits of open systems  - which allow them to pick and choose from vendorswho are now more eager to please them, even though the customers must nowtake the trouble to hunt and compare.andM;7 Soviet rubles sell for about 10 to the dollar on the black market, but forsubsidized goods such as food and books and even clothing they're worth $2 to$3 or more in US purchasing power.andP;  The problem is there are things you justcan't normally get with rubles, such as personal computers, washing machines,cosmetics  - all the things InterImpulse hopes to import.andM;8 There are also about 80,000 cooperatives, but most have only a couple ofpeople and few of them are engaged in manufacturing.andP;  This is a sign both ofthe co-ops, lack of access to resources and of the government's own failureto provide service and distribution systems, which are regarded asexploitative and superfluous in Communist doctrine.andM;9  Champagne to my true friends, true pain to my sham friends.) Previouslythe New York Stock Exchange was more or less a private club that owned aprotected market: Prices of stocks were negotiated, but the prices chargedfor each transaction were set by the exchange.andP;  Weeden, a &quot;third-market&quot;firm, created competition by trading stocks outside the market  - pleasingcustomers but allienating competitors.andP;  Ultimately, the NYSE, the bastion offree markets, gave in  - not so much to Weeden but to its customers (and WallStreet turned its focus from stock-trading to investment banking and junkbonds, but that's another story).andP;  Weeden andamp; Co. ended up being acquired, butfive years ago it became independent again  - free to engage in high-risk butmeaningful ventures such as this one.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
