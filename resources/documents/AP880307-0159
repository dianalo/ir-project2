WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrats Richard Gephardt and Albert Gore Jr.are in a battle of their own in Tuesday's Southern primaries,competing for the same voters and harboring hopes of knocking eachother out of the presidential race.   With Jesse Jackson poised to collect the South's considerableblack vote, and Michael Dukakis scoring with Southern liberals,Gephardt and Gore are both vying for what's left: the moderate andconservative, blue-collar and middle-income white voters.   Acknowledging Dukakis may do very well Tuesday, each would liketo emerge as the white alternative to the Massachusetts governor.And each would like to move on to the next round of contestswithout the other, trying to draw a bead on Dukakis.   Both Gore and Gephardt have scaled back Southern expectations astheir initial strategies have not been fulfilled.   Gephardt concentrated on the early Iowa contest, hoping it wouldpropel him. But his victory there hasn't provided momentum in theSouth. Gore played on regional appeal, but that hasn't been enoughin a field fractured by so many candidates.   The result: Each needs to beat the other to continue.   ``There are two Gs in this race and only one G is going North,''said one source close to Gore's campaign, insisting on anonymity.   Gephardt's tough foreign trade-retaliation message and thepowerful television commercials that helped him in South Dakota andIowa have been overwhelmed by the enormity of campaigning in the 20states of Super Tuesday.   He has spent about $1.2 million on television _ and has beenoutspent three-to-one by both Gore and Dukakis.   Gore has been pummeling Gephardt in tough negative televisioncommercials that the Gephardt campaign acknowledges has beeneffective against their candidate. Gore has branded Gephardt a``phony flip-flopper.''   Dukakis also has slammed Gephardt with television ads thatdepict him as a flip-flopper on issues.   ``We have been pinned down in a very tough negative crossfirebetween Dukakis and Gore,'' said Gephardt polltaker Ed Reilly.``They have gone to any areas we have strengths, especially Gore,and just beat the ... out of us. That's effective ... but I thinkthe net effect is going to be to drive (voter) turnout down, veryvery low.''   Gore has run ads attacking Dukakis and Jackson, too, but themain focus of the television attack has been on Gephardt.   ``Ideally for the Gore campaign, we would like to _ and weexpect to _ narrow the field by eliminating Dick Gephardt, therebycreating a situation where Senator Gore can focus clearly onMichael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson,'' said Gore spokesman ArlieSchardt.   An ABC News poll of the South released Monday night said that``the biggest loser on Super Tuesday will probably be RichardGephardt, who is leading only in his home state of Missouri andcould drop below the 15 percent threshold for delegates'' in 12 of16 states polled.   Both Gore and Gephardt are focusing on the delegate count comingout of Super Tuesday rather than the number of states won. Neitherpredicts an outright win in the biggest states of Florida andTexas, but they hope to collect a big share of delegates there.   Gore forces believe if they can push Gephardt into afourth-place finish in delegates, and hold him to winning littlemore than his home state of Missouri, he will be staggered andunable to continue. Gephardt forces scoff at that notion.   ``They're not going to knock us out,'' said Reilly. ``No way ...it's absurd.''   But both Gephardt and Gore face the prospect of leaving theSouth impoverished and facing, in Dukakis if he wins Florida andTexas, a candidate who has demonstrated national appeal.   Gore took out a $1 million line of credit to saturate Southerntelevision. Gephardt faced a financial squeeze going into the Souththat limited his ability to run the ads that proved effectiveelsewhere, including his vow that unless South Korea opened itsmarkets he'd put so many taxes on their products a Hyundaiautomobile would cost $48,000.   Noting that ad, Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach said: ``TheHyundai may very well run out of gas on Tuesday night.''</TEXT></DOC>
