Similar relationships between historyand genetics have been observed in numerous previous studies. However,in this Black Carib project, not only is history used to explain geneticsbut genetic data are utilised to resolve various historical ambiguities.For example, historians have been unable to agree upon the relative contributionsof the Amerindians and West Africa slaves to the formation of the BlackCarib population. The historical literature is replete with contradictorydescriptions of the Indian or the African likeness of the Black Caribs.However the genetic estimates of admixture of Central Americn Black Caribspaint a consistent picture. The genetic results also document gene flowfrom the Highland Maya to the Black Carib and Creole gene pools, despitehistorical claims of reproductive isolation.</TEXT></DOC>
