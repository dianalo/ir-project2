The steelmaker filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in July 1982 after being named a defendant in thousands of lawsuits filed by individuals claiming asbestos-related injuries.    The plan provides for issuance of additional UNR common stock to satisfy $112.7 million of unsecured pre-petition liabilities and all asbestos-related claims. The company said the plan also provides that all recoveries from insurance companies and the U.S. government will become assets of UNR.    Under the plan, UNR said 64% of the common stock of the reorganized company will be allocated to asbestos-related creditors and 28% of the stock to non-asbestos creditors. Existing shareholders will retain 8% of the common stock and will receive six-year warrants to buy an additional 8% at $5.15 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
