The decline, to pretax earnings of #509.2 million ($887million) from a record #650 million in 1986, reflectedtighter underwriting conditions, higher expenses and hugecatastrophe losses in 1987. In that year, a series of storms-- including a hurricane that swept Britain and WesternEurope in October -- led to higher claims.</LP><TEXT>   As a result, underwriting profit for the year fell 45%, to#411.7 million, from #744.5 million. In particular, Lloyd'ssaid underwriting profit in its nonmarine lines was&quot;disappointing&quot; at #8.7 million, a drop from #218.3 million ayear earlier.   Lloyd's reports its results three years late to accountfor the filing of claims and litigation. Profit fromunderwriting and investment operations represents theaggregate results of 401 syndicates back by 28,770 investors.   Murray Lawrence, chairman of the 302-year-old insurer,said Lloyd's continuing exposure to U.S. asbestos, pollutionand other so-called &quot;long-tailed&quot; liability policies makesthe 1988 and 1989 accounts look even &quot;less satisfactory&quot; than1987. Profit in 1988 may be lower than 1987, in part due tosuch disasters as the explosion aboard the OccidentalPetroleum North Sea oil platform.</TEXT></DOC>
