It then examines the outlook for crudeoil supplies in the Asia-Pacific region and concludes that the region'sheavy dependence on imports from the Persion Gulf will grow as indigenousoil production declines over the next 10-15 years. The real energy optionsfor the region are seen to be coal and natural gas. However, the growthin coal use is forecast to be limited, with coal facing significant competitionfrom natural gas, and itself (increased supplies, e.g., from China arelikely to depress prices and reduce investment). 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
