 The eighties have seendramatic changes in our computing resources.andP;  As faculty and students havegained experience and sophistication, their requirements and expectationshave changed.andP;  Technology, too, has changed.andP;  Planning under stableconditions is difficult; under constantly changing conditions, planningbecomes even more challenging.andP;  Faced with significant resource constaints,business school policy and decision makers need additional information toassist with this difficult task and responsibility.andM;The rapid and dramatic changes in business school computing resources isillustrated in Figure 1, which shows some of the hardware milestones.andP;  Thisgraph, taken from last year's survey, shows the pattern of mini/mainframe andmicrocomputer introductions into business schools from 1950, projected to theyear 2000.andP;  A series of successive introductions of future, as yetunidentified, technologies is also shown.andP;  These might include CD ROM,scanners, expert systems, and the visualization of data.andP;  Even though thedetails of new technologies is not known, it is clear that thesetechnological introductions will probably occur more frequently and beintegrated faster than before.andM;The goal of the Fifth UCLA Survey of Business School Computer Usage is tocontinue monitoring the changing nature of the business school computingenvironment.andP;  The purpose has remained the same since we began the surveysfive years ago: to provide deans and other policy makers with informationthey can use in making allocation decisions and program plans with regard tocomputing.andP;  The reader is cautioned that the focus of the surveys is toreflect what the schools report they $Iare$N doing, and is not an endorsementof what they should be doing.andM;The first, second, and fourth surveys gathered information on the hardware,software, and resource allocations of schools, while the third surveyaddressed issues of concern to deans.andP;  This year's survey looks at businessschool computerization in terms of process, recognizing that the introductionand use of technology is ongoing and that schools may not only be approachingproblems from different perspectives, but at different rates as well.andM;The questionnaire for this year's survey requested four types of data:demographics, short answer, ranking, and phase.andP;  Demographic and selectedhardware statistics from previous survey databases were presented forcorrection and update.andP;  Short descriptions of plans, strategies, and resultswere requested.andP;  Four categories of issues (strategic, instructional,operational, and network) were listed for ranking.andM;The fourth type of data was based on the multidimensional aspect of thecomputerization process.andP;  In these questions, respondents were asked toindicate their &quot;phase&quot; of usage for 21 different areas of business schoolcomputerization.andP;  Each phase was delineated by points along a processcontinuum.andP;  The phase diagram together with a description of each phase ispresented in Appendix A.andP;  This particular phase diagram was generated basedon reviews of other life-cycle-process type graphs and personal experience.andO;The phases are all relative to the individual school's perception of someconcept of a stable or mature environment, and each particular response isrelative to the perception of the specific individual who completed thequestionnaire.andP;  Furthermore, the values indicated do not represent a commonstarting point, say 1980 or any other specific point in time.andP;  Rather, thepurpose is to capture a more subjective reflection of where the respondentviews his/her business school along the process continuum.andP;  It indicates, tosome extent, past accomplishments, present position, and future expectations.andM;Where Are Business Schools with Respect toandM;Computerization?andM;One way to answer this question is to average the responses to the 21 phasequestions.andP;  This single point is 5.2 and suggests that, overall, businessschools are at mid-growth.andP;  Figure 2 presents a phase diagram showing themean for each of the 21 phases for the 175 participating schools.andP;  Each phasemean is represented by an abbreviation.andP;  Thus, collectively, business schoolsare at the investigation phase with respect to 32-bit high performancegraphic workstations (Workst).andP;  Similarly, business schools are collectivelyjust getting started with student and faculty use of microcomputer baseddesktop publishing and presentation graphic applications (S Desk and F Desk,respectively).andP;  The early growth area includes electronic/computer-linkedequipment in classrooms (Cls Eqp), development of local area networks (LAN),number of portable microcomputer systems (Port), computer integration intothe curriculum (Cur Int), providing microcomputer software information tousers (SW Info), and student use of microcomputer analytic tools (S Anl).andO;The late growth phase includes providing microcomputer hardware informationto users (HW Info), student and faculty computer literacy (S Lit and F Lit,respectively), student and faculty use of microcomputer productivity tools (SProd and F Prod, respectively), mini/mainframe use for administrative support(MF Admn), and computer support operating budget (Budget).andP;  Finally, thebusiness schools collectively reflect a mature level with respect to thenumber of microcomputer labs and systems (Num Lab and Num PC, respectively),and use of mini/mainframes for research and instruction (MF Res and MF Inst,respectively).andM;To better understand where business schools are, the data is analyzed in twoways.andP;  After a brief presentation of the sample demographics, data from allparticipating schools are combined to look at it in terms of the separatecomputerization process areas.andP;  The second step looks at the data in terms ofclusters of schools, grouped by the similarity of their responses to the 21phase questions.andM;Profile of Participating SchoolsandM;The population for this year's study was once again the schools currentlyaccredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AASCB)and the eight Canadian schools of business that participated in previoussurveys.andP;  Of the 264 schools invited to participate, 175 returned completedquestionnaires, a 67 percent response rate.andP;  This represents a 40 percentincrease over 1987 and may indicate that more business schools now havecomputer equipment and data to contribute and share the concerns and issuesaddressed by the surveys.andP;  The numbers in square brackets indicate which ofthe previous surveys (if any) the schools also participated in.andP;  Eighty-onepercent of the schools that participated in 1987 also participated in 1988.andM;Table I displays general demographicinformation about the 175 schools in thisyear's sample together with demographics from previous surveys.andP;  For some ofthe categories displayed in Table I, the ratio of schools within each samplehas been consistent for the past three surveys.andP;  For example, for 1985, 1987,and 1988 the ratio of public to private institutions has remainedapproximately two-thirds public and one-third private.andP;  However, differencesin other areas point out significant shifts in the make-up of this year'ssample.andP;  Of particular impact is the shift in student enrollments, the numberused in the calculation of microcomputer densities and budget per studentdollar allocations.andP;  The 1988 sample has an 81 percent increase over the 1987sample is schools with student enrollments of more than 3000 FTE (full-timeequivalent), representing an increase from 31 to 56 schools in this category.andO;The data seem to indicate that the schools that are now entering the studyare larger, may be entering computerization at a lower cost per student thanthe earlier schools, and are able to move along the learning curve with fewerrisks and less trial and error than the early innovators.andM;We should point out that these surveys do not comprise a longitudinal study.andO;We are not taking the same sample of schools and following them over a periodof time; rather our survey samples comprise the accredited business schoolsthat wish to add their data to the sample.andP;  Comparisons between years aremisleading and should not be used to conduct any trend analyses.andM;STRATEGIC LEVELandM;PlansandM;Are there formally stated computer/information systems goals, plans, orobjectives for business schools?andP;  Ninety-two schools (53 percent) indicatedthat they had no formal planning document while eleven schools (6 percent)were in the process of formulating them.andP;  The remaining 72 schools (41percent) had plans of which 57 provided details.andP;  Nine schools attachedcopies of their plans (ranging from 3 to 22 pages in length) and another 48schools provided brief statements.andP;  Many of the plans included multipleobjectives.andP;  Table II presents an analysis and summary of the plans of these57 schools, divided into six categories based on orientation: strategic,instructional, hardware, software/database, network, or support services.andP;  Ascan be seen from the table, the most frequently mentioned goals wereinstruction oriented.andP;  Many of the statements in this area indicated aninterest in increasing the use of mini/mainframe systems as well asmicrocomputer systems.andM;Twelve schools indicated different plans for their graduate and undergraduateprograms, but no pattern emerged from this group.andP;  Several schools indicatedthat their MBA programs led the undergraduate programs, while at the otherextreme, other schools indicated there were formal goals only for theundergraduate program.andP;  The remaining 45 schools indicated no differencebetween the graduate and undergraduate plans.andM;BudgetsandM;Budget information, consistently the top ranked issue in the surveys,remained extremely difficult to capture and interpret.andP;  The respondents wereasked to indicate their school's computer operating budget, the real dollarsfrom any source designated to support academic and administrative computingwithin the business school.andP;  The budget estimate was not to include facultysalaries or university funds allocated for computer hardware acquisitions orrecharge on university systems.andP;   Ninety-four percent of the schools providedbudget data which is summarized in Table II.andM;Based on the midpoints of these categories, the total computer operatingbudget of the business schools in this year's sample is estimated at$29,800,000; an average $181,000 per school.andP;  Figure 3 allocates this totalamount across the schools for undergraduate, graduate, and administrativesupport, and suggests that approximately equal amounts are spent onadministrative and undergraduate programs while graduate programs receive alarger portion.andP;  The mean allocation per student was $125, while the medianwas $27, indicating that a few schools were spending significantly more thanmost.andM;The phase diagram in Figure 4 suggests that budgets were growing for most ofthe schools, and stable for only 29 percent.andP;  A few schools were reevaluatingtheir budgets.andM;IssuesandM;The questionnaire presented a list of 13 strategic computing support issuesfrom which the respondents were asked to rank the five most important.andP;  TableIV lists the issues identified by at least one-third of the schools.andP;  As thetable indicates, finding funds and appropriate curriculum development wereranked first and second.andP;  Curriculum objectives have consistently been thejustification for the high costs of computerization, but these curriculumobjectives are very elusive and difficult to quantify.andP;  Faculty incentivesand courseware related issues (discussed later) confound this problem.andP;  Theother issues mentioned reflect the overall findings of this survey, and linkwith the other areas discussed later.andM;INSTRUCTION AND CURRICULUMandM;Where are business schools with respect to the use of computers in coursesand electronic/computer-linked equipment in the classroom? Answers to thesequestions are suggested in Figure 5, which shows that 70 percent of theschools are in a growth phase for computer integration.andP;  Fifty percent of theschools are in a growth phase for equipment in the classroom.andP;  These growthphase designations suggest a clear commitment to classroom technology on thepart of the business schools.andP;  Significantly more progress is expected.andM;IssuesandM;Important issues challenge business schools as technology is introduced intothe curriculum and classroom.andP;  Table V lists the eight issues identified byat least one-third of the respondents.andP;  These issues can be further dividedinto people issues (faculty incentives and teaching styles), content issues(defining appropriate levels and selection of courses), courseware andtechnology.andP;  &quot;Appropriate curriculum that uses computing&quot; was the secondranked strategic issue in Table IV.andP;  Table V delineates the problemsassociated with curriculum development.andP;  Note that &quot;faculty incentives&quot; isthe fourth-ranked strategic issue (Table IV), but is ranked first amonginstructional issues (Table V).andP;  This discrepancy will remain until thetraditional criteria for promotion are revised to acknowledge time spent oncourseware development and computer integration.andM;InnovationsandM;This year's survey presented an opportunity for the business schools to shareinformation on innovative and exciting uses of technology: &quot;Do you have anyprojects, labs, or other features which you would like to share?&quot;andP;  Fifty-fourschools (31 percent) provided either a short description or attachedmaterials (articles, proposals, or brochures) for a total of 72 differentprojects.andP;  Table VI summarizes these by major category.andP;  Many of theseinnovations are technological combinations, or unique applications oftechnology.andM;MINI/MAINFRAME COMPUTERSandM;Forty percent (70) of the schools participating in this year's surveymaintain their own minicomputer or mainframe systems.andP;  Table VII details 127total systems by make, model, and number of the systems when at least threeschools indicated having a particular model.andM;As the table indicates, the total number of systems increased 65 percent(from 77 to 127 individual computers).andP;   Although nine vendors wererepresented, Digital Equipment Corporation had the largest number of systemsinstalled, with 44 systems, 35 percent of the total.andP;  The VAX family ofsystems dominates, with the VAX 11/7xx models most common.andP;  The other majorsystems installed in the business schools are the IBM 4300 series (16), ATandamp;T3Bx series where a dramatic percentage growth is seen, increasing 367 percentfrom 3 to 14 systems.andP;  An important question arises regarding the role anduse of the mini/mainframe systems located within the business school.andP;  Thephase diagram shown in Figure 6 summarizes the schools' perceptions of wherethey are regarding their use of the large systems for instruction, research,and administrative support.andP;  With respect to research and administrativesystems, a growing or stable environment is most common.andP;  However, withrespect to instruction, about one-third of the schools are reevaluating theiruse of these systems, supporting the general observation that a significantportion of student instructional computing is migrating to the microcomputerenvironment.andM;MICROCOMPUTERSandM;Availability and DensityandM;As was shown in Figure 1, microcomputers have been the fastest growth area inbusiness school computer usage, and the data from this year's survey suggeststhat this trend has not diminished.andP;  Figure 7 displays the number ofmicrocomputers and micro labs in the schools.andP;  Fifty-one percent of theschools expect the number of systems will continue to grow.andP;  The figure alsosuggests a slower growth in the number of microcomputer labs, perhaps due tofactors such as lack of space and funds rather than need (as per Strategicand Operational Issues).andM;Tables VIII and IX display the number of microcomputers by school and model,respectively.andP;  Both of these tables suggest that IBM is dominant.andP;  Table VIIIshows that 86 percent of the schools have at least four IBM PCs or IBMPC/XTs.andP;  Furthermore, IBM PC/ATs or PS/2 systems are present in aboutone-third of the schools.andP;  The other major vendors in this year's sample areZenith, having systems in 42 percent of the schools, and Apple, with systemsin 29 percent of the schools.andP;  All of the other models were in 14 percent orless of the schools.andM;With respect to the total number of models, shown in Table IX, although IBMPCs and PC/XTs are still the most common systems, their numbers relative toother systems are decreasing as could be expected with the technologicaladvances and price performance alternatives offered by the expanding market.andO;In general, the total number of systems in this year's survey increased 63percent over the number of systems in 1987, while the sample of schoolsincreased only 37 percent.andP;  The average number of systems per schoolincreased by 24 even with the large increase in the number of schools.andM;A pervasive question is: How many microcomputers are adequate for a businessschools' students' needs?andP;  To answer this question, the survey asked aboutthe general sufficiency of microcomputers to meet &quot;normal&quot; demand (excludingexam time or end of term).andP;  The responses to this question were combined withthe average microcomputer densities (the number of students or faculty whoshare access to a school-provided microcomputer).andP;  As presented in Table X,the eleven schools that indicated &quot;never any waiting&quot; for students averagedabout 24 students per microcomputer.andP;  One hundred sixteen schools (71percent) indicated that an average microcomputer density of 39 resulted inoccasional waiting for their students.andP;  In great contrast, however, were thefaculty microcomputer densities which averaged just under 2 faculty sharing asystem with no waiting, and about three sharing a system with some waiting(see Table XI).andM;UsageandM;As important as the number of microcomputers available within businessschools is how these systems are being used.andP;  To capture this information, aseries of phase diagrams were presented related to the use of microcomputersfor personal productivity (word processing, basic spreadsheets anddatabases), desktop publishing and presentation graphics, and as an analytictool (advanced spreadsheets, statistics, and modeling).andP;  The results arepresented in Figures 8, 9, and 10.andP;  The pattern for both faculty and studentswas very similar for productivity and analytic usage; in contrast, studentusage lagged behind faculty usage with respect to desktop publishing.andP;  Also,even though productivity was slightly ahead of analytic use in the stablephase, both are experiencing high growth.andP;  This is, once again, in contrastto desktop publishing which is just getting off the ground.andM;The surveys also asked for an indication of general computer literacy offaculty and students.andP;  Figure 11 suggests that faculty literacy is in a morestable phase than student literacy and that the growth in literacy isprimarily in the student area.andP;  This may be explained by the fact thatfaculty are more permanent and can be trained and supported over a longerperiod of time than students who are constantly entering with mixed andvaried backgrounds.andM;Important to the introduction of computer technology into the educationalenvironment is the availability of knowledgeable individuals to assistfaculty and students in analyzing requirements, configuring appropriatehardware, and selecting software.andP;  The data in Figure 12 suggests that manyschools are just beginning to provide this service.andP;  However, it isquestionable whether this type of service should be included within the scopeof responsibility of the business school, or is more appropriately theresponsibility to the university or the public marketplace.andM;PORTABLE COMPUTER SYSTEMSandM;While desktop microcomputers dominate business schools at this time, portablecomputer systems are an area of potential growth and expansion.andP;  Figure 13displays the schools' current phase of the number of portable microcomputersystems.andP;  Fifteen percent of the schools indicated portable technology as notapplicable, while another 14 percent are investigating the feasibility ofthis technology.andP;  One-quarter of the schools (27 percent) are just gettingstarted and another quarter (23 percent) see the number of systems growing intheir environments.andP;  Thirteen percent indicated that the number of portablesystems is stable; eight percent are reevaluating this technology.andP;  Thisphase diagram is the &quot;flatest&quot; and shows the greatest variability inresponses across the range of the process, perhaps reflecting confusion withrespect to portable systems and controversy over their use.andM;Tables XII and XIII present a different view of portable systems.andP;  Table XIIdisplays information on portable systems installed by school.andP;  For sevendifferent models, there were at least four systems found in the schools,ranging from a high of 43 percent of the schools with Zenith systems to 4percent with Tandy.andP;  This was the first year that both Toshiba and Tandy hadsufficient systems in the schools to be mentioned separately.andM;Table XIII presents portable systems by total numbers.andP;  There was a 65percent increase (82 to 135) in the number of schools which reported havingportable systems available.andP;  However, there was only a 43 percent increase inthe total number of portable systems.andP;  The net result was a decrease in theaverage number of portables per school from 19.8 to 17.2.andP;  This data suggeststhat a large number of schools have acquired a small number of portablesystems for experimentation and evaluation.andM;32-BIT HIGH PERFORMANCE GRAPHICandM;WORKSTATIONSandM;An area of increasing interest among some faculty members is the 32-bitworkstation, coming close to the provision of a desktop &quot;mainframe.&quot;andP;  Thesevery sophisticated and expensive systems may be appropriate for faculty whoseresearch interests require extensive numeric calculations, very highresolution graphics, statistical and mathematical modeling, artificialintelligence, and expert systems.andP;  As the price performance ratios continueto fall, these systems may in fact become the baseline microcomputertechnology of tomorrow.andM;Table XIV presents the information on the workstations found in the schools,together with model number data.andP;  The table shows that 31 schools haveacquired these workstations, and of these schools, 42 percent have Sunsystems.andP;  On the other hand, IBM RTs are in higher concentrations, with moresystems (59) in fewer schools (26).andM;The phase diagram shown in Figure 14 suggests that high performance graphicworkstation technology may not be appropriate for most business schools atthis time.andP;  It is interesting to note that three schools (2 percent)indicated that they have reached a stable number of these systems.andM;OPERATIONAL LEVELandM;With the significant increase in computer equipment in the business schools,operational concerns and responsibilities have grown.andP;  Computer staff areneeded for user support and equipment maintenance.andP;  Space for labs andstorage must be found.andP;  Electrical power and cabling must be provided.andP;  Ingeneral, the introduction of microcomputers has created many small computercenters that require a great deal of attention.andM;The responents ranked the 10 most pressing operational issues from a list of23.andP;  Table XV summarizes these responses and shows that 14 different issuesemerged as important to at least one-third of the schools.andP;  This list coversmost of the issues important to any computer center operation: training,maintenance, space, software, hardware acquisition, staff, and meeting userneeds.andM;In addition, two other questions regarding equipment upgrade/replacementstrategies and the role of vendor donations were asked.andP;  Table XVI displaysthe 10 different upgrade strategies indicated by 81 schools.andP;  Only 17 schoolshad plans for replacing existing equipment, including selling, trading,giving away to others, or using the parts for other systems.andM;With respect to vendor donations, Table XVII summarizes the current status.andO;Twenty-six percent of the schools indicated that vendor donations play animportant to critical role in overall strategy.andP;  However, several of theseschools commented on the unreliability of vendor support, indicating thatthis uncertainty made strategic long-term planning even more difficult.andM;NETWORKSandM;It appears that almost all schools are interested in linking microcomputerstogether with some kind of network.andP;  Figure 15 displays the phases ofdevelopment of local area networks.andP;  As can be seen from the figure, about anequal number of schools are either investigating this technology, justgetting started, or seeing the number increase within their schools.andP;  Lessthan 10 percent have reached stability and about 5 percent are alreadyreevaluating this technology.andM;Table XVIII displays the seven most frequently mentioned network issues.andP;  Itappears that three of these issues are related to software, three totechnology, and one to operations.andP;  The interesting point here is that unlikethe strategic, instructional, and operational areas, no single issuedominates.andM;CLUSTER ANALYSISandM;This year's questionnaire was designed to capture information regarding wherebusiness schools are in the computerization process.andP;  Recognizing thatschools started at different times, with different human and financialresources, and different objectives, they could be assumed to be in differentplaces in the process.andP;  Furthermore, the issues and concerns facing theschools may be different at different points in the process.andP;  Moreinformation might be provided to business school deans and strategic plannersif the schools could be grouped according to similarity of their phaseresponses.andP;  Separate issues and resource allocation decisions might emergerelated to the different groups.andP;  One method for grouping schools accordingto their similarities is cluster analysis.andP;  Applied to 172 of the schools inthis year's sample, the schools were clustered based on their individualresponses to the 21 phases.andP;  Three schools were omitted because of five ormore missing phase values.andM;Five distinct clusters emerged from the data.andP;  These clusters group thebusiness schools into those which are just getting started in thecomputerization process, those in early or late growth, those that havereached a general level of stability, and those that show a broad mix acrossall phases.andP;  For each cluster, a mean value was calculated for each of the 21phases.andP;  These means roughly summarize where the business schools in aparticular cluster are in the computerization process.andP;  Table XIX presentssummary demographics for the five clusters, organized by the overall mean foreach cluster.andP;  The cluster labeled Start-Up shows a mean of 4.2 and reflectsan earlier point in the computerization process than for any of the otherclusters.andP;  In contrast, the Stable cluster has a mean of 6.5 and representsbusiness schools that are more mature in the computerization process.andP;  Basedon the mean values, the Mixed-Phase cluster is placed between the Early andLate Growth clusters.andM;Although there are some general trends in Table XIX the large variance withinclusters mitigates statistical relationships between the phases and type ofschool, student FTE, computer budget per student, and student microcomputerdensities.andP;  In contrast, however, the schools in the Late Growth and Stableclusters tend to have their own mainframes, and are more involved with newuses of technology.andM;Figure 16 presents the phase arrangements that define each cluster.andP;  As inFigure 2, each phase mean is represented by an abbreviated description.andO;Several patterns can be discerned in Figure 16, with the most general being ashift from top-left to bottom-right.andP;  For example, student use of desktoppublishing (S Desk) is in investigation (level 1) for the Start-Up cluster,in initial action (level 2) for the Early Growth and Mixed-Phase clusters,and in start-up (level 3) for both the Late Growth and the Stable clusters.andO;Of special interest is the use of mainframes for instruction (MF Inst) whichpresents a chaotic variety across the five clusters: in maturity (level 7)for the Start-Up and Late Growth clusters, in the introduction to users(level 4) for the Early Growth cluster, in the choice point (level 9) for theMixed-Phase cluster, and in the institutionalized (level 8) for the Stablecluster.andP;  This could be interpreted as a reflection of the confusion over therole of the mini/mainframe in an environment being infused withmicrocomputers and networks.andM;Table XX separates the four previous issue areas (strategic, instructional,operational, and network) by clusters, and presents the issues by rank orderwithin each cluster.andP;  The five clusters show distinct differences.andP;  Acrossthe Strategic Issues, though, there is general agreement upon the top sixissues, and some difference in rank order is seen.andP;  For example, lack ofgoals (Lack goals) is of more concern to the first two clusters than the lastthree.andP;  Short term plans (Shrt Trm Plns) is ranked among the top six for theStart-Up and Early Growth clusters only.andP;  Funding and curriculum development(Cur Devel) are the first or second issue for all groups except the Lategrowth cluster, where it appears as third.andM;With respect to the Instructional Issues, more agreement among the issues isseen.andP;  Faculty incentives (F incentives) and teaching style or motivation touse technology (Teachr style) follow tightly together within the first fourranks of all clusters.andP;  Similarly, defining an appropriate level ofintegration (Amt integr) and selection of course to be integrated (Whatintegr) follow closely together across all of the clusters, except for theStable cluster which suddenly seems to be no longer concerned with what tointegrate.andM;Among the Operational Issues, there is less common agreement across theclusters.andP;  Insufficient hardware (Insuff HW) appears to be important for theStart-Up and Early Growth clusters, drops to third for the Mixed-Phase,fourth for the Late Growth and then disappears.andP;  Matching technology to userneeds (User needs) appears only in the last two clusters, and development ofa realistic budget (Real Budget is only of concern to the Stable cluster.andM;An interesting pattern appears in the Network Issues, where a clear sequenceappears, perhaps reflecting developmental changes.andP;  An example is theStart-Up cluster, which network technology to adopt (Net choice ) is rankedfourth.andP;  In contrast, this issue moves to first for Early Growth, second forMixed-Phase and then drops to third for Late Growth.andP;  It disappears entirelyfor the Stable cluster, where, instead, more complex network issues appear,such as incompatibility of competing network technologies (Incom net), aswell as response time on network (Respons time) and software not designed foruse on networks (Non net SW).andP;  Microcomputer-to-mini/mainframe connectionsare an issue for all five clusters.andM;SUMMARY AND OPEN QUESTIONSandM;The focus of this year's survey has been on where business schools are in thecomputerization process.andP;  The objective has been to take a &quot;snapshot&quot; along aprocess continuum to provide understanding about where business schools havebeen and where they may be going.andP;  Overall, the evidence suggests thatbusiness schools are at a stage of mid-growth with respect to the 21 phasequestions this survey explored.andP;  Greater and more rapid growth is projectedbefore business schools in general reach a mature stage of computerization.andM;For the past four years, the UCLA surveys have focused on the question ofwhat the business schools had in terms of computer resources.andP;  Sincemicrocomputers emerged as the area of most dynamic activity, about half ofthe phase questions of this year's survey were related to microcomputerusage.andP;  The number of microcomputer systems and the number of labs atbusiness schools seem to be just entering a mature phase, the beginning of asteady state.andP;  And, lagging just behind this provision of microcomputerhardware resources is the usage of these resources.andP;  Even though it has beenonly a few short years since microcomputers became available in largenumbers, faculty and student literacy and productivity, and faculty analyticuse are in the phase of late growth, suggesting a real use of and dependenceon this technology.andP;  Tying in directly with this growth is the provision ofadequate faculty training which emerged as the single most dominantoperational issue in business schools.andM;In contrast to the microcomputer usage patterns, the data suggests that atthe beginning of this decade mini/mainframe systems were seen as integral todecentralization.andP;  Now it appears that schools are reevaluating thesesystems, while attempting to network microcomputers to provide many of thesame services once available only in the time sharing mini/mainframeenvironment.andP;  The phase diagram showed that over one-third of the schoolswere reevaluating the use of mini/mainframes for instructional support,tending toward their replacement by microcomputers.andP;  The patterns forresearch and administration were similar to each other: both indicated about30 percent in a growth stage, about 40 percent in a stable phase, and 20percent under reevaluation.andP;  Business schools have a clear responsibility toprovide their graduates with the microcomputer literacy demanded by thecorporate community, but graduating students must also understand thedistinction between the purposes and uses of mini/mainframe and microcomputersystems.andP;  The role of the mini/mainframe in the corporate world is, and willcontinue to be, very significant.andP;  How business schools meet this challengemay emerge as a significant issue of the 1990s.andM;Thirty-two bit high performance graphic workstations and desktop publishingwere both identified as emerging areas in the business school computerizationprocess.andP;  On the other hand, portable computer systems showed the greatestvariance in phase responses.andP;  This technology in particular is undergoingtremendous change as display quality improves and lighter-weight, morecompact systems evolve, and may be an area of exciting growth.andP;  Portablemicrocomputer technology seems to be a prime example of where conceptualexpectations preceded available technology.andM;Although a phase question was not asked about the planning process, the dataindicate that 53 percent of the schools have no formal computerization plans.andO;The schools recognize this as a shortcoming as 45 percent indicated a lack ofgoals and/or strategic planning as a major issue.andP;  The other significantstrategic issues were related to obtaining funding, developing appropriatecurriculum, keeping current with technology, and providing faculty incentivesfor courseware development.andP;  Faculty incentives and appropriate curriculumwere first and second ranked instructional issues.andM;In addition to these global observations of where business schools are in thecomputerization process, five distinct groups of business schools emergedfrom a cluster analysis of the data.andP;  These groups roughly corresponded tobusiness schools in Start-Up, Early Growth, Late Growth, and Stable phases,as well as a Mixed-Phase Cluster, which showed wide dispersion across all ofthe phases.andP;  In these five groups, the four issue areas (strategic,instructional, operational, and network) displayed very different patterns.andO;Although the issues generally remained the same for all five clusters, theyoften ranked the issues very differently.andP;  In some cases, a concern to thecluster of schools in the earlier phases was resolved by those clusters inthe later phases (e.g., insufficient hardware, space, and choice of network).andO;On the other hand, some issues emerged only for the cluster of schools in thelater phases (e.g., role of grants, development of a realistic budget,problems of incompatible networks, and network response time).andM;The other two areas that emerged again in this survey are curriculumintegration (which is tied closely to faculty incentives) and funding issues.andO;The cluster analysis revealed that the business schools furthest along in thecomputerization process had in general resolved the issue of &quot;what tointegrate into the curriculum&quot; as well as which courses to integrate, anissue of concern to the four earlier clusters.andP;  However, concern related tothe degree of integration, courseware design and development support, teacherstyles, and faculty incentives for courseware development remained and willremain until the traditional criteria for promotion are revised toacknowledge and reward time spent on courseware development and computerintegration, or until the marketplace provides adequate coursewarealternatives.andM;In contrast to some of the problems of curriculum integration, the problemsof funding are not resolved with progress along the computerization process.andO;However, one clue to partial resolution of the issue may be offered by theappearance of &quot;finding grants for support&quot; among the strategic issues of theschools furthest along the process.andP;  A more aggressive approach toalternative means of computer resource acquisition may be rewarded,especially as used microcomputer equipment becomes available with corporateupgrades.andM;The cluster analysis approach provided greater insight in terms of wherebusiness schools are, and suggested that for those schools in the earlierstages, careful planning, focus on standardization, and consideration of theissues of concern to those in later stages could, in fact, enable moreefficient and effective progress along the growth curve.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
