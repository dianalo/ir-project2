Leading monitors of production by the 13 members of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries estimated Iraqioutput has dropped as low as 600,000 barrels a day. That'sbarely one-sixth of the 3.5 million barrels the country waspushing out during a brief surge just before the last OPECmeeting in late July.</LP><TEXT>   Current output is covering Iraq's domestic needs, with alittle margin to support the tiny flow of exports &quot;leaking&quot;through the near-blockade of the country. The refusal ofmajor oil-buying nations to trade with Iraq means oil tankersaren't showing up at the usual Middle East ports to pick upoil as they normally would. Storage facilities have becomechoked, leaving Iraq no choice but to cut the flow from itswells.   Only a small amount of oil now is leaving Iraq, mainly intrucks crossing into Jordan. The final destination isn'tknown.   For a while, world oil supplies are expected to remainplentiful because of indicated production increases elsewhereand high inventories, including a large number of cargoes ofIraqi and Kuwaiti crude still at sea. But the reduction inIraq production suggests an eventual tightening of world oilsupplies unless the lost Iraqi oil is replaced by others inOPEC.   Oil prices rose again yesterday on reports that Iraq'spipeline across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea has now beenclosed and that an Iraqi tanker was turned away from theSaudi terminal of Al-Muajjiz, even though those events hadbeen expected. These developments followed last week'sclosings of two Iraqi pipelines across Turkey to theMediterranean.   On European spot markets, North Sea crudes were priced 35cents to 55 cents a barrel higher. In the U.S. futuresmarket, September crude also was up 54 cents, to $26.77 abarrel, when trading was suspended because of a power outagein lower Manhattan.   In Kuwait, occupied by Iraqi troops since Aug. 2,production is said to be near zero. This means that thelosses to world oil markets from the combined reductions inIraqi and Kuwaiti output now total some 4.3 million barrels aday.   Total OPEC production is down even more -- some 4.4million barrels a day -- from the July average. That'sbecause some countries such as the United Arab Emiratesreduced their output for August in line with the terms of thelate-July OPEC agreement.   But there are signs that overall OPEC production isbeginning to recover some from the lows of recent days,according to Petro-Logistics Ltd., which monitors OPEC outputon a weekly basis. Conrad Gerber, president of theGeneva-based firm, predicted that output in the third week ofAugust will expand to around 21.5 million barrels a day.Total production has dropped to 19 million barrels a day inthe second week of August, after averaging 21 million barrelsa day in the first week of the month. As a result, he said,&quot;I would expect the August average to be about 21 millionbarrels a day.&quot;   That isn't enough to meet anticipated demand of 23 millionbarrels a day for OPEC oil for the remainder of the year. &quot;Itlooks like we are not able to replace the {embargoed} crudein full unless there is more export leakage out of Kuwait andIraq than we had assumed,&quot; said William Edwards, a Houstonenergy consultant.   The gap could be filled for a while from &quot;surge&quot; capacity,estimated at some 4.2 million to 5.3 million barrels a day byPetroleum Intelligence Weekly. The publication defines suchcapacity as extra output available around the world fromexisting fields for as long as 30 days.   There isn't much spare capacity outside OPEC that couldsustain additional production over several months. WithinOPEC, some countries, such as Venezuela, already areproducing more. Beyond that, an estimated additional 3.5million barrels a day of spare capacity remains that could beutilized on a sustained basis. Most of it is in Saudi Arabia.The Saudis have indicated a willingness to increaseproduction if necessary to maintain stability in oil markets.   Overall, with Iraq and occupied Kuwait excluded, OPECcould produce close to its second-half production ceiling of22.5 million barrels a day if the 11 other members went allout.   Yesterday, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., Prince BandarBin Sultan, told a Washington news conference that OPEC willhold a meeting soon to discuss ways of stabilizing the oilmarket. &quot;In that meeting, I hope we can come up with goodnews,&quot; Prince Bandar said, adding: &quot;But my country ischampioning stabilizing the situation in the oil market.&quot;   A senior member of an OPEC delegation from anotheroil-exporting country said yesterday that consultations arecontinuing among the oil ministers regarding a possibleemergency meeting. But he said it is uncertain for the timebeing because of difficulty in determining Kuwait'srepresentatives.   Separately, in the U.S., retail gasoline prices fellnearly 3.5 cents a gallon over the weekend, to a nationalaverage of $1.216 a gallon, the American AutomobileAssociation said. After a run-up of 15 cents to 20 centsacross the country, pump prices nationally began to edgelower last Friday. Changes are regional, however, and someprices rose.</TEXT></DOC>
