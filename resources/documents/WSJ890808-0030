Mr. Milken was charged last March in a 98-count indictment alleging that he had committed racketeering and fraud. Also indicted were Mr. Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, and Bruce Lee Newberg, a former Drexel junk bond trader.    Much of the information alleged in the March indictment was given to the government by Ivan Boesky, the imprisoned former stock speculator. Since 1986, Mr. Boesky has cooperated with prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office in the case against Mr. Milken.    Many of the charges in the new indictment will be based on information provided the government by witnesses who began cooperating late last year and early this year, according to individuals familiar with the investigation. Those witnesses include three Drexel employees who worked for Mr. Milken and a former client of Mr. Milken's.    Drexel agreed last December to plead guilty to six felony counts to avoid racketeering charges. A provision of Drexel's criminal plea agreement calls for the firm not to pay Mr. Milken or his brother much of their 1988 compensation. The Milkens have challenged that provision. U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said in court yesterday that she will hold a hearing on the motion later this month or early next month. </TEXT></DOC>
