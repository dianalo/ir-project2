Army.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>GAOSuggests Limiting Army SystemsandM;The General Accounting Office has recommended that the Army limit newadministrative information systems to those that are legally required, untilthe service's fledgling informatio resources management program has provenmore effective.andM;GAO's Information Management and Technology Division made its recommendationto Rep.andP;  John P. Murtha (D.Pa.), chairman of the powerful HouseAppropriations Subcommiettee on Defense, in a report he ordered last year.andO;The subcommittee is expected to produce this month a report on which 1991 ADPfunding for the services will be based.andM;GAO advised Murtha to limit Army spending because the key componenet of theIRM program -- the development of an Armywide information architecture -- hasnot yet been developed.andM;In addition, GAO said some recent steps designed to get components of anarchitecture in place have not  yet proven effective.andP;  Those actions weretaken by Lt.andP;  Gen.andP;  Jerome Hilmes, the director of information systems forcommand, control, communications and computers (DISC4).andM;Asked about the report, Hilmes said, &quot;I'd say they're skeptical of the Army'sprogram based on past history.andP;  I think they've revisited the sins of ourpast very well.andP;  But that's my point -- they are only old sins.&quot;andM;In April, Hilmes told the subcommittee of a number of recent DISC4 efforts tocorrect management flaws in Army ADP.andP;  The service had identified 191separate issues gleaned from 140 GAO reports, defense agency audits and otheroversight reports, many of which criticized the Army for allowing systemsdevelopment to be controlled locally by major commands, intallations andbases [GCN, May 4].andM;&quot;Wish List&quot;andM;The DISC4 office was found in the mid-1980s in part to give the Army aheadquarters-level control over the field.andP;  But GAO said that while Hilmeswas sending out new policy directives and establishing new review processesearlier this year, field commanders continued to behave as they customarilyhave, ordering computers not against validated mission needs but rather theirown &quot;wish lists.&quot;andM;&quot;I can only conclude that they talked to some people [in the commands] whohaven't gotten the word,&quot; Hilmes said.andP;  Late last year he ordered that allrequirements for systems that pre-dated the past year be canceled so hisofice can review any ADP acquisitions in excess of $2.5 million.andM;Senior Army officials also have called on installations to produceinformation management plans that conform with the new directives, GAO said.andO;Such plans identify and validate requirements and will from the basis for theoverall architecture, GAO said.andP;  In many cases, officials have said, thearchitecture will be aimed at moving the Army away from so-calledcommand-unique and proprietary systems to open systems.andM;However, GAO auditors said, &quot;At the installations we visited, plans weretypically a collection of procurement requests consolidated under theumbrella of a very broad Information Management Plan initiative.andP;  .  .  . andO;The individual initiatives were not supported by a plan of how they wouldfacilitate movement from the current to the future environment.&quot;andM;At Army bases such as Fort Knox, Ky., requirements, but check to ensure thatequipment ordered is compatible with what is to be sued at the installationlevel,&quot; GAO reported.andM;When revieweing such requirements, DISC4 officials could not ensure thatinitiatives submitted by major commands and installations &quot;would ultimatelyconform to the Army information architecture,&quot; GAO said.andM;Moreover, because such projects are not tied to the budge process, once theyare approved they can be used to justify procurements indefinitely, it said.andM;But Hilmes said that afte recent visits to the commands he came awayconvinced commanders are prepared to comply with new directives and arebecoming &quot;very prudent steards.&quot;andM;Hilmes said he believes GAO &quot;is not aware of our latest efforts to promulgatethe Army architecture,&quot; nor how seriously the efforts are being taken withinthe commands.andM;A Thousand FlowersandM;&quot;They want to discipline this system,&quot; Hilmes said of Army commanders.andP;  &quot;Theylearned from the [prior] situation, where we had a thousand flowers blooming,that if you want to really benefit from automation you have to have somebodyin charge that puts the architecture out there, decides what data elementsare standard, and all the other things that makes data interchangeable.&quot;andM;Hilmes said he will ask commanders at installations specifically cited in thereport about GAO's charges.andP;  &quot;If those installations are not in compliance[with DISC4 initiatives], I predict they'll get there,&quot; he said.andM;Besides Fort Knox, GAO cited flaws in policy compliance at Fort Cambell, Ky.,andO;andFort Hood, Texas.andP;  GAO also cited the Forces Command, headquartered atFort McPherson, Ga., and the Training and Doctrine Command, Fort Monroe, Va.andM;GAO concluded that only if money for new systems is withheld will commanderscommit themselves and staff to DISC4 policies.andM;Hilmes, however, said the commitment GAO calls for already exists.andP;  &quot;There'sno sense in waiting to develop new systems,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We've got individualprograms that can start saving us millions of dollars right away, totalingbillions of dollars.andP;  GAO revisited the sins of our past very well but that'shistory.andP;  You can't dwell on that.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
