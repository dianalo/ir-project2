In Washington, a state official says the company's Pacific Northwest Bell unit told her it probably wouldn't locate a big, new research center in the state because of her pro-regulation views. The center, which will employ 1,500 people, is coveted by several Western states.    In Colorado, U S West's Mountain Bell unit has publicly vowed to throw its considerable political weight against any lawmaker who votes to renew the state's consumer-advocate post, now held by a man often critical of the company's deregulation and pricing policies.    And in Minnesota, an official inquiry last year concluded that the Northwestern Bell unit had abused the regulatory process by frequently entertaining two now-departed commissioners while they were considering a rate case.    U S West's brushes with state regulators are scenes from the convulsive world of telecommunications after the Bell System breakup. Almost since its creation in January 1984, U S West has been arguing strongly for total deregulation of its prices and profits in the 14 Western states where it operates. It contends that regulation is hampering it in competing against a slew of new, mostly unregulated companies that are chipping away at its business.    All seven regional Bells as well as their former parent, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., are pushing for further deregulation. But none is seeking it on the scale that U S West wants or has so irked regulators, legislators and consumer groups. U S West is pursuing &quot;a schoolyard bully approach to deregulation,&quot; says Renz Jennings, a member of Arizona's Public Utilities Commission.    Because the battle lines are sharply drawn, the dispute clearly illuminates the stakes involved in deregulation of ATandamp;T's seven offspring. The Bells envision fairer, though in some cases higher, prices for customers; financial incentives to offer new products and services, and presumably larger profits for their shareholders. But many rival companies fear crushing competition from unfettered Baby Bells and warn of steep price increases.    U S West denies ever acting unethically in its push for deregulation. But Richard McCormick, U S West's president and chief financial officer, concedes that it has been aggressive. &quot;If you don't make dust, you eat dust&quot; is a favorite company slogan, and it typifies the rootin' tootin' cowboy image that the company likes to project. At a recent analysts' meeting in Vail, Colo. -- the company courts Wall Street as hard as it lobbies regulators -- the party favors included cowboy hats.    The man responsible for U S West's maverick stance is its chairman and chief executive, Jack A. MacAllister. A 60-year-old Iowan whose priestly demeanor suggests neither a bully nor a cowboy, Mr. MacAllister was a 34-year veteran of ATandamp;T when the Bell System was broken up. In the conformist halls of ATandamp;T, he stood out as something of a nonconformist but nonetheless had risen to head the Northwestern Bell unit by the time of the breakup.    Mr. MacAllister, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has persistently challenged regulators. In early 1986, for example, U S West tried to prevent federal Judge Harold Greene from applying to it the very breakup decree that created the company. U S West argued -- unsuccessfully -- that the agreement, which barred the Baby Bells from long-distance and information services and manufacturing, didn't apply to U S West because ATandamp;T, its former parent, didn't properly represent U S West's interests in the breakup.    Earlier this month, Judge Greene continued to ban the Baby Bells from long distance and manufacturing but allowed them limited entry into the electronic information-services market. But U S West and other regional Bells are considering whether to appeal the ruling or seek congressional relief. Like the other Bells, U S West has been arguing for the right to enter new businesses, and it also has been pressing the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees its interstate operations, for regulatory relief.    But although federal regulation gets more attention, state regulation of the Baby Bells currently affects them more strongly. And it is at the state level that U S West's deregulation campaign stands out for breadth and controversy.    U S West says it needs profit deregulation because its earnings are brushing against its allowed rate of return on investment, the cap set on profits by regulators. Last year, U S West earned $924 million on revenue of $8.31 billion. Without the ability to increase earnings, the company says, it lacks the incentive to operate as efficiently as possible.    U S West adds that it needs price deregulation to compete against unregulated rivals that can set prices at will. Moreover, it complains that price regulation forces it to disclose sensitive internal data that help competitors set their own prices.    The Baby Bells' competitors include, among others, resellers, which lease phone service at bulk rates; &quot;interconnect&quot; companies, which install phone systems; and operators of private telecommunications networks, which permit large corporate customers to operate their own internal phone systems.    Although all these rival services have grown in recent years, U S West is especially concerned about the growth of private networks. It says there are more than 1,700 networks, mostly microwave systems, in its territory. Moreover, it says many private-network owners have excess capacity that they can sell to other corporate customers.    Even residential customers now have alternatives that threaten its revenue, U S West complains. For example, some real-estate developers are arranging &quot;shared tenant&quot; service, which gives home buyers a price break on phone and related services. Earlier this year, Mountain Bell had to bid against several private vendors for a contract to provide such a network to a new development in Phoenix. The U S West unit won the job, but its revenue may be lower than they would have been if the home owners had had to deal with it individually.    But U S West still has a monopoly on local switching, and no one can even get a dial tone except through one of its three operating units. As a result, many people believe that U S West is exaggerating the competitive threat.    In a recent regulatory filing in Utah, Northwestern Bell even asserted that one of its competitors is Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution, a department store based in Salt Lake City. Northwestern Bell says answering machines sold by Zion's are an alternative to answering services that it itself might someday provide.    As for private networks, some regulators say major customers often build them to handle remote locations that U S West doesn't serve. Moreover, U S West itself has an unregulated subsidiary that, among other things, provides equipment for such networks. Last year, Maricopa County in Arizona abandoned Mountain Bell's Centrex service but remains a U S West customer, having settled on a replacement system from the parent company's phone-equipment unit.    Nor are shared tenant services the threat portrayed by the company, some regulators contend. In Colorado, for example, providers of such services aren't even allowed to make a profit on them, says Rodney Blyth, an official with the Colorado Public Service Commission. Even the company acknowledges that the market for such networks in commercial buildings has turned out to be a dud.    U S West officials &quot;see ghosts that we don't see,&quot; concludes Charles Adams, Washington's chief consumer advocate.    So far, U S West's opponents have been able to block its sweeping proposals. Arizona's voters this year rejected a referendum to change phone regulations. Idaho's Gov. Cecil Andrus vetoed a deregulatory bill on the ground that it &quot;places the universal availability of the telephone in jeopardy for too many of our citizens.&quot;    Eleven other states in U S West's territory, including Minnesota and Iowa, totally deregulated some services, singled out some for possible relief and retained rules on others, such as the local phone calls that U S West monopolizes.    Of the 14 states covered by the company, only Nebraska has suspended practically all regulation. But the state attorney general is challenging the law, which became effective in January, and legislators have made several attempts to repeal it. The only price change in the works, according to U S West, is a cut in intrastate long-distance rates. (However, Eastern Nebraska Telephone Co., a tiny independent operator, has proposed doubling the price for local service to about $12). U S West hasn't said whether it will add any new services soon, but it is planning to offer free installation to customers ordering a second phone line. Previous regulation made such promotions difficult.    Critics assail U S West's tactics as much as its goals. One of the biggest flaps involves its planned research center. (The company has delayed the site selection because of uncertainty over whether Judge Greene's ruling on manufacturing also prohibits research and development by the Baby Bells.) Sharon Nelson, chairman of the Washington Transportation and Utilities Commission, complains about Andrew V. Smith, Pacific Northwest's president. She says he berated her over dinner earlier this year for her pro-regulation views. She says Mr. Smith told her the company would thus &quot;take a dim view&quot; of selecting Washington for the research center.    &quot;Linking economic development with deregulation of monopoly {telephone} service is inappropriate,&quot; she argues. Mr. Smith comments only that the conversation was &quot;frank and private.&quot; Officials in Arizona and Iowa also have complained that U S West tried to link the site selection to its deregulation campaign. Their complaints helped spur some regulators to pass a resolution condemning the company's alleged attempts &quot;to improperly influence regulatory decision making.&quot;    The company says the complaining regulators are off the mark. &quot;We hope we are treating {the site selection} objectively and fairly, so they don't feel we have made some deal,&quot; says John C. Willemssen, executive vice president and chief planning officer.    U S West carried its campaign to Colorado earlier this year, proposing a bill to lift all regulation except for some controls on local service. Its Mountain Bell unit encouraged employees to support the bill and told them that they might lose their jobs if it failed. At one crucial hearing, a company lawyer said U S West wouldn't compromise anymore, prompting an irate committee chairman to withdraw the measure. In the end, U S West had to settle for a less-sweeping deregulation bill.    Moreover, a story in the Daily Sentinel in Grand Junction, Colo., raised the issue of whether Mountain Bell was trying to buy support for deregulation in Colorado with gifts for rural economic development. When the deregulation bill was being considered, the company's Mountain Bell Foundation pledged some $100,000 for rural development. Included was $10,000 for a project in a legislator's district; the company presented the gift to her within hours of a meeting at which she discussed the bill with Mountain Bell employees. The company and the legislator, who ultimately voted against the bill, denied that the gifts were attempts to sway votes.    &quot;U S West is its own worst enemy,&quot; says a former state cabinet member who sympathizes with the company's desire for less regulation.    In Minnesota, the company's thunder was stolen, industry officials say, primarily because of a scandal involving Northwestern Bell's relations with two former regulators. The Minnesota Public Service Commission last year found that Northwestern had frequently bankrolled lavish meals for the two commissioners and their spouses, and the agency decried what it called &quot;a serious abuse of the regulatory process.&quot; As a result, the current commissioners reconsidered a 1984 rate case and ordered Northwestern Bell to reduce rates $12 million more than originally specified. Northwestern is appealing the new order.    In recent weeks, regulators say they have detected a more conciliatory tone from U S West, an observation that some company officials confirm. &quot;We are willing to commit to regulatory oversight in certain components of our business where there's less competition today than there will be in the future,&quot; says Gary Ames, Mountain Bell's president. Mr. Ames also was named this summer as U S West's top executive responsible for public policy.    As further evidence of repairs in relations with regulators, Mr. Ames says the company is close to agreement with Utah on providing regulators data on transactions between U S West's unregulated operations and the regulated phone-company units. That agreement might also be adopted by several other states.    Yet, U S West plans to press for more deregulation. &quot;The concern I have is speed,&quot; says Mr. Ames, adding that the company doesn't have &quot;two or three years to wait; the clock is running.&quot;    ---                           U S West    Its Service Area...
