Steele,director of marketing for Aquidneck Systems International Inc., NorthKingstown, R.I.andM;To add to the complexity, information has been collected at many differentscales.andP;  &quot;A satellite image is different than a plane fly-over image,&quot; Steelesaid.andM;Aquidneck was awarded a $187,000 contract for a pilot project to store asubset of digital cartographic data using an optical archiving system.andP;  Theobject is to gain experience with optical disk storage technology anddetermine its usefulness and reliability, Steele said.andM;The system was shipped to the Geological Survey last month, but it will takeseveral months to convert data from magnetic tape to optical disk, Steelesaid.andP;  The MARK II database is expected to be operational in 1992, he said,adding it will advance cartographic systems development and automation.andM;Only about 100 gigabytes of old data will be converted to the opticalarchiving system during the pilot program.andP;  However, new information will bestored on the system and &quot;the amount of data stored on optical disk by thetime the project is finished may exceed the size of the current database,&quot;Steele said.andM;The MARK II national digital cartographic database will keep track of alldigital land use data.andP;  The database will be stored on an IBM 3090-classAmdahl mainframe, Steele said.andM;&quot;Currently USGS workers must take several minutes to find a magnetic tape andmount it on a reading device,&quot; Steele said.andP;  &quot;With Aquidneck's Autochangersystem, workers can gain access to optically stored data in less than 10seconds.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
