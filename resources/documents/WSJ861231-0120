Hughes</HL><DD> 12/31/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   In this history, Otto Friedrich chronicles the Hollywood empire at its zenith -- and in its decline and fall. Mr. Friedrich, a senior writer at Time, also provides a social history of Hollywood at a time when racism and fear took the form of race riots, when a witch hunt for communists led to industry blacklisting of leftists and when Asian-Americans were interned as security risks because of the war with Japan. Anti-Semitism was rampant.    &quot;City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s&quot; (Harper andamp; Row, 495 pages, $25) rambles through its 10 years, scattering the best and the juiciest anecdotes that Mr. Friedrich was able to cull from his self-alleged reading of about 500 books on Hollywood. He says he avoided interviews because everyone important had already been interviewed.    Some of the most amusing of his anecdotes have to do with the misjudgments of studio tycoons, many of whom seemed to bumble their way to huge fortunes. Louis B. Mayer, then president of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, said he saw little future for any actor with the protruding ears of Clark Gable and he rejected a proposal to help finance Mickey Mouse because, he told Walt Disney, &quot;every woman is frightened of a mouse.&quot; Irving Thalberg, a production chief of MGM, announced that talking pictures were &quot;just a passing fad&quot; and turned down &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; since &quot;No Civil War picture ever made a nickel.&quot;    There is lots here about Hollywood scandals. Lots on sex goddesses. Bette Davis's husband Harmon Nelson, a band leader, taped a romantic tryst between his wife and Howard Hughes and then threatened to make the tape public unless Hughes paid him $70,000. Hughes forked over the cash. Later, Ms. Davis repaid it.    Humphrey Bogart and his third wife fought frequently; one evening, she lunged at him with a butcher knife. He ducked and ran but she stabbed him in the back. He woke to hear a doctor say, &quot;It's not so bad. Only the tip went in. He's a lucky man.&quot; His wife also threatened to kill him after accusing him of courting Ingrid Bergman -- giving an added edge to his performance in Casablanca.    Mr. Friedrich writes with indignation throughout the book about the small-mindedness that fueled the decade's bigotry. He describes Jack Warner of Warner Bros. as Hollywood incarnate, &quot;vain, ignorant, pretentious, deceitful, greedy, ruthless and passionately fond of telling bad jokes.&quot;    He does, however, seem to be a big fan of Bertolt Brecht, and the title of this book comes from the opera Brecht wrote with Kurt Weill, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny,&quot; &quot;city of nets.&quot; Brecht wrote, &quot;It should be like a net/Stretched for edible birds. Everywhere there is toil and trouble/But here we'll have fun. . . .&quot;    Brecht was evidently unhappy during his stint as a Hollywood writer. He wrote in his diary: &quot;I get the impression of having been removed from my age. This is Tahiti in metropolitan form. . . . I have the feeling of being like Francis of Assisi in an aquarium, Lenin at the Prater (or the Oktoberfest), or a chrysanthemum in a coal mine.&quot;    William Faulkner wasn't wild about Hollywood either, but he went there because his books weren't selling. &quot;They worship death here,&quot; he once remarked at dinner with a friend. &quot;They don't worship money, they worship death.&quot; He wanted to write for Mickey Mouse but was put to work revising various projects and later fired.    The book details a wide range of events: changing taste in films, the making of patriotic and anti-communist films, various trials, unions, racketeering, even the budding acting career of Ronald Reagan. Mr. Friedrich is a diligent researcher, a snapper up of obscure facts about brushfires, floods, salaries and wedding gifts.    The freight of data is heavy, but the sprightly anecdotes outweigh the boredom this book often induces. For example, Mr. Friedrich relates that after director Howard Hawks bought the rights to the novel &quot;The Big Sleep,&quot; a team of screen writers discovered that the author, Raymond Chandler, never explained who killed the chauffeur. When Hawkes sent a telegram asking who had committed the murder, Chandler wired back: &quot;I don't know.&quot;    The decline and fall of the Hollywood empire, billed as part of the book's main theme, seems more of a tertiary theme, woven in among the anecdotes. Television was becoming increasingly popular and millions of people stopped going to the movies. The Justice Department ordered the major studios to give up their interest in some 1,400 movie theaters in an effort to dissolve their monopoly. And some of Hollywood's best talent had been exiled or imprisoned in the communist witch hunt.    In the end, &quot;City of Nets&quot; seems to have covered the decade much like a racing car on ice, skidding from one subject to the next. It doesn't go anywhere in particular, but the ride is fun and the driver is a smart guy with a sense of humor.    ---   Ms. Hughes is a reporter in the Journal's Los Angeles bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
