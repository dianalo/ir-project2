(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Apple ConnectivityandM;In less than a decade, the worldwide installed base of microcomputers hasrisen to more than 100 million, with sales revenues approaching $45 billion.andO;At least some of this remarkable growth comes from the fact that machines asdifferent as the Apple Macintosh and the IBM PC can exchange vital data.andM;Although Apple Computer Inc. makes only about 15 percent of the world'smicros, it has shown steadfast determination not to let its Macs stand alone.andO;A recent survey by Dataquest Inc. of San Jose, Calif., revealed that, of morethan 1.5 million Macintoshes in government, business and educationalsettings, a tremendous majority are networked -- nearly 72 percent.andM;That figure dwarfs the 27 percent of IBM PCs, OS/2s and compatibles innetworks.andP;  About 80 percent of all micros today are PC-compatible.andM;From the beginning, Apple worked hard to enable Mac users to communicate witheach other.andP;  It built a data link, LocalTalk, into every Mac.andP;  It gave itsAppleTalk network protocols easy naming and addressing functions.andM;Yet users wanted more.andP;  Convinced of the Mac's worth for word processing,graphics and communications, they clamored to link it to all kinds ofnon-Macintosh devices, particularly IBM ones.andM;Apple responded with products like AppleShare PC, giving MS-DOS users accessto AppleShare file and print servers.andP;  The company also ported AppleTalkprotocols to Digital Equipment Corp. VAX machines running VMS so that Macusers could get at VAX file and print services.andM;In 1989, Apple raised the Mac connectivity stakes higher with AppleTalk PhaseII.andP;  This brought addressing capability for as many as 16 million AppleTalkdevices on an extended network, and added Mac support for Ethernet andtoken-ring networks.andM;The company announced new software and hardware that ushered in connectivityto millions of minicomputer and mainframe devices, regardless of operatingsystem.andM;Third-party vendors have followed suit with Macintosh connectivity packagesfor virtually every network configuration.andP;  New announcements appear almostweekly.andM;This Buyers Guide chart lists generalized file-transfer utilities withhardware adapters and software, such as Ideassociates' Ideacomm Mac, DataVizInc. MacLinkPlus and Vano Associates Inc. MacChuck.andM;The chart also takes note of electronic mail and communications packages,including a Mac version of Microcom Inc.'s popular Carbon Copy remotecommunications and control software.andM;The chart lists new products from both Apple and third-party vendors forMac-to-Ethernet and Mac-to-token-ring connectivity, as well as LAN-based Macconnectivity products from DEC, Banyan Systems Inc. and 3Com Corp.andM;MacLinkPlus and MacChuck work with shrinkwrapped communications programs viaa modem and telephone line.andP;  Or they can be hard-wired for direct connectionwith a null modem, which may come with the package.andM;The result is the same: From your Macintosh menu, you can read a PC's diskand indicate the file you want converted to or from a Mac application.andO;Everything you type shows up on the PC.andP;  MacChuck also lets you transferbinary files from the PC to the Mac.andM;Devices Can ChatandM;Dynamic Microprocessor Associates Inc.'s PC MacTerm II and II/Network dobidirectional file transfers and allow Mac and PC devices to chat.andM;For file transfers from Mac to midrange IBM machines such as the System/36and 38 and the AS/400, Ideassociates has released the Ideacomm Mac adapterand software.andP;  The package transfers files and accesses the minis' databaseswith the Mac cut-and-paste option.andM;Newbridge Networks Inc.'s PC-Mac software makes Macintosh connections tomultiple devices over circuit-switched networks.andP;  Loaded onto Newbridge'sMainStreet data controllers, PC-Mac lets users share files, printers andservers with IBM devices over a switched public network.andM;For file transfers between a LAN device and a remote Macintosh, Microcom'sMac version of Carbon Copy Plus is in a class by itself.andP;  Like the PCversion, Carbon Copy Mac works with virtually any network configuration andallows a remote Mac to access and control the host device.andM;It is a real advance in connectivity to be able to share files and devicesbetween Macs and machines running other operating systems, across a nullmodem or a telephone line.andP;  But as always, network managers and users wanteven more.andM;Major LAN manufacturers have responded to this desire with Mac versions oftheir LAN operating systems that let the Apple machines participate as bothservers and clients on the network.andM;3+Open for Macintosh from 3Com gives Mac users full access to the company'sOS/2 LAN Manager via the familiar Mac interface.andM;Banyan has announced a deal to resell Miramar Systems Inc.'s MacLAN Connectsoftware as part of its Vines operating system, until the company developsits own Mac-to-Vines interface.andM;Not EnoughandM;Some people still complain that all of the above, although steps in the rightdirection, are only partial answers because they depend on proprietary LANarchitectures.andM;For Macintosh sales to continue to rise, said Ed Foreman of Apple USA'smarketing group, &quot;It's going to be necessary for a networked Macintosh tohandle distributed processing and interprocess communications in aheterogeneous environment.&quot;andM;Moving in that direction, Intercon Systems Corp. recently shipped TCP/ConnectII, an enhancement to its previous version of TCP/IP network services.andO;TCP/IP, a set of network protocol standards originally developed for theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency, has proved effective in connectingcomputers from different vendors.andM;TCP/Connect II lets the Macintosh participate in file transfer, electronicmail, network management and other functions with virtually any otherTCP/IP-compatible micro, mini or mainframe computer.andM;DEC recently released LANWorks, which provides file and print services forMacs connected to VAX devices on DECnet networks, along with access toelectronic mail, VAX relational databases and X Window applications.andM;Products such as Alisa Systems Inc.'s AlisaTSSnet and Pacer Software Inc.'sPacerLink can turn a VAX into a Macintosh server on 10-megabit/sec Ethernets,with most of the features of LANWorks.andM;Token-ring LAN installations are expected to surpass Ethernets by as much as15 percent in 1992.andM;Market researcher International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass., haspredicted that nearly 3 million 4-megabit/sec token-ring nodes and more than525,000 dual 4/16-megabit/sec nodes will be installed by 1991.andM;Apple itself has taken steps to ensure Mac connectivity with this growingtoken-ring presence via the TokenTalk NB plug-in NuBus card for Macintoshsystems and related AppleTalk software for token-ring protocols.andM;Several third-party vendors, including Avatar Corp. and Tri-Data SystemsInc., have Apple licenses to make hardware and software for the token-ringarchitecture.andM;One thorny problem for Macintosh users has been the difficulty of queryingand maintaining relational databases written for non-Mac platforms.andP;  Plentyof database programs just for the Mac are available, but until recentlynon-Mac databases were off limits.andM;Recognizing the need to marry these Structured Query Language (SQL)relational databases to Macintosh platforms, Apple developed ConnectivityLanguage/1, or CL/1, to bridge the gap between mainframe SQL and the Mac.andM;CL/1 helps users navigate the murky SQL waters by making the Mac a front endto query and process information from the mainframe, which later stores theupdated results.andM;It is not even necessary to go out and buy CL/1.andP;  Database managers such asMicro-soft Corp. Excel, Informix Software Inc. Wingz, Ashton-Tate Corp.andP;  FullImpact, Acius 4th Dimension and Blyth Software Inc. Omnis 5 all build CL/1into their command languages.andM;CL/1 is available in Apple's new System 7.0 operating software as the DataAccess Manager, so both software developer and users can call on it wheneverthey need it.andM;J.B.andP;  Miles writes about networking and wide area communications from SanDiego.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
