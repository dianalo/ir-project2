Bretz, chairman of the survey committee for the National Association of Purchasing Management.    The purchasing agents' composite index for July rose to 58.2% from 57.3% in June, reaching its highest level since May 1984. A composite index above 50% generally indicates the economy is expanding; an index below 50% indicates a decline.    The index has averaged 55.5% for the first seven months of 1987, suggesting stronger growth than in 1986, when the average was 51.5%. The seven-month level, if maintained, indicates full-year growth of 3.5% in the nation's real gross national product, or total inflation-adjusted output of goods and services.    About 14% of the buying agents reported gains in employment for July, a smaller percentage than the 18% for June and 17% for May. Meanwhile, 17% said employment levels declined, a greater percentage than in the prior two months. Before March of this year, buying agents had reported declines in employment for 29 consecutive months.    The survey is based on responses from purchasing agents at 250 industrial companies and measures how various business activities have changed from month to month.    Purchasing agents reported that new orders increased for the seventh consecutive month, rising more briskly than in the previous two months. July's &quot;robust expansion in new orders (suggests) continued growth in the third quarter,&quot; said Mr. Bretz, who is director, materials management, for Pitney Bowes Inc.    Production climbed for the seventh consecutive month, but the rate of growth slowed. About 30% of the purchasing agents said production rose in July, off slightly from 32% in June. About 15% said July's production declined. &quot;Considering the normal seasonal slowing in July, production was very strong,&quot; Mr. Bretz said.    For the 11th consecutive month, purchasing agents reported more price increases than decreases. Of the buying agents, 50% reported higher prices in July, compared with 48% in June and 38% in May. The people surveyed expect further price increases totaling 2.3% for the final five months of 1987.    The only item in the survey to decline in price was natural gas. Prices rose for metals, including steel, copper, aluminum, zinc and brass. Paper products, fuel oil, materials used in plastic products and chemicals continued their upward trend.    Inventories declined in June, with just 13% of the agents reporting higher inventories and with 28% reporting lower inventories.    The speed of vendor deliveries slowed for the ninth consecutive month. Only 3% of the agents reported faster deliveries, while 20% reported slower deliveries. Buying lead-times for production materials increased, with 15% reporting lead-times of 90 days or longer, compared with 11% for June. </TEXT></DOC>
