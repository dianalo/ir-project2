L. 95-541), hasdeveloped regulations that implement the ``Agreed Measures for the Conservationof Antarctic Fauna and Flora'' for all United States citizens. The AgreedMeasures, developed in 1964 by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties,recommended establishment of a permit system for various activities inAntarctica and designation of certain animals and certain geographic areasas requiring special protection. The regulations establish such a permitsystem to designate Specially Protected Areas and Sites of Special ScientificInterest. Additional information was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 21, 1988. The application received is as follows: 1. <T3>Applicant: </T3>Gerald L. Kooyman, Physiological Research Laboratory,University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093. Activity for Which Permit Requested Taking; Import into the U.S.A. The applicant is conducting a study of divingphysiology in vertebrates. The applicant proposes to collect Emperor penguinsand Weddell seals, attach blood and muscle electrodes, temperature thermistors,ECG electrodes, and microprocessor/recorders. After the experiments theinstrumentation will be removed and the animals will be released. In a second set of experiments, the applicant proposes to collect fourlive Emperor penguin chicks and return the specimens to the Sea World laboratoriesin San Diego. The birds will be used in studies of the energetics, hydrodynamicsand physiology of graded swimming exercises. The birds will be held atthe Sea World penguin facility after the experiments. <T3>Location: </T3>McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. <T3>Dates: </T3>October 1988_February 1989. <ITAG tagnum="6">Charles E.
