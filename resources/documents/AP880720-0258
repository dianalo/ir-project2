Not the drama (certainly not this week). Not the food(check back next month, after New Orleans). It's the shamelessrhetorical excess!   And all of it this week directed at one man. The man with onename. George.   Poor George, that toothache of a man, that hear-nothing,see-nothing, do-nothing vice president. A man, it has now beensaid, ``too squeamish to bait his own hook.''   In a spirit of generosity, the Democrats sometimes give Georgemore than one name. They give him the four he was born with, as inGeorge Herbert Walker Bush ``of the Kennebunkport Bushes.''   Bush is the target of this attention by virtue of the fact thathe is to be nominated next month by the Republicans to standagainst Michael Dukakis, a Democrat about whom not one humorousthing has been said this week at his convention in Atlanta.</TEXT><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For a host of up-and-coming Democrats who aren'tnamed Dukakis or Jackson, the party convention provides a stage forthem to strut their stuff and dream of bigger days to come.   Among the rising stars who got to perform before the crowd of11,000 in The Omni and millions more watching on television:Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, selected to nominate Michael Dukakis onWednesday night, and Texas Treasurer Ann W. Richards, who skeweredGeorge Bush in her folksy keynote address Monday.   Each harbors higher ambitions, Clinton to run for presidenthimself one day, and Richards to become governor of the Lone Starstate in 1990.   Others play out bit roles at the 40th Democratic NationalConvention, often making their entrance when the cameras of thenational television networks are dark, or turned the other way.   But for young politicians like Louisiana State Sen. Cleo Fields,who is all of 25, and Texas State Rep. Lena Guerrero, 30, justgetting to the rostrum was a sign that somebody in the partyhierarchy liked them.</TEXT><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The senator was pelted with questions: What washe doing at the convention? How did his speech go the night before?How would Michael Dukakis handle rural issues? And would Iowaretain its first-in-the-nation presidential primary contest?   Not exactly network fare.   But it's the kind of interview that's going on dozens of times aday at the Convention Satellite News Service, the DemocraticParty's equal-opportunity showcase for TV stations too poor to cometo the convention and politicians unlikely to show up on thenetwork evening news.   The Convention Satellite News Service, with 46 hours oftransmissions scheduled during convention week, is costing about$300,000 _ all of it paid for by congressional campaignorganizations and associations of Democratic governors, mayors andstate party chairs.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration welcomed onWednesday a Soviet offer to dismantle the disputed Krasnoyarskradar complex in Siberia, but spurned Moscow's attempt to link theproposal with other arms control squabbles.   As a result, the two sides still seemed far apart in theirinterpretations of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, whichlimits radar installations as well as various tests for a ``StarWars'' defense against Soviet rockets.   ``The Soviets should comply with their ABM treaty obligations bydismantling the radar without delay and without conditions,''Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokeswoman, said. ``I am notgoing to discuss the merits of conditions.''   She reiterated President Reagan's contention, which has widesupport even among critics of his arms control policy, that thephased-array radar at Krasnoyarsk was in conflict with the 1972treaty.</TEXT><DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   While a grand jury met Wednesday to hearmore evidence in the Pentagon bribery case, a federal judge refuseda newspaper's request that he unseal information filed byinvestigators to obtain search warrants against their prospectivetargets.   U.S. District Judge Claude A. Hilton said that public release ofthe affidavits would ``harm the process' of the investigation. Thecontested material triggered the authorization, by various courts,of dozens of searches by federal agents around the country on June14.   Meanwhile, the grand jury met for a second day to hear from theJustice Department team which has coordinated the massive,2-year-old investigation, which came to public light only when thesearches got under way.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Growth in personal income slowed in all butthree states during the first three months of 1988, barely keepingahead of inflation, the government said Wednesday.   The Commerce Department said growth in income in the 50 statesand the District of Columbia slowed to 0.8 percent in theJanuary-March period, compared with growth of 2.8 percent in thefinal quarter of 1987.

Income in the 12 months ending March 31 expanded by 6.3 percent,while inflation was 3.8 percent.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An unpublished memo written by the head of theFood and Drug Administration shows the agency wants to rejectproposals for broader limitations on sulfite food preservatives,despite estimates that the chemicals can be extremely dangerous toa million or more Americans.   A consumer health group said Wednesday the FDA's failure to actendangers many asthmatics and others who have a severe reaction tosulfites, including the possibility of death within hours afterfood containing the chemicals is eaten.   Sulfites, which have been used for decades to preventdiscoloration in food, have been banned since 1986 for use on freshfruits and vegetables, such as those sold in salad bars. Freshpotatoes have been exempted from the ban, but will be includedlater this year, FDA officials say.</TEXT><DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new, harder line shift in theleadership of the Nicaraguan Contras and a resulting split withtheir so-called ``Southern Front'' could be politically costly tothe anti-Sandinista rebels.   The alliance between the Southern Front and the principal Contracoalition known as the Nicaraguan Resistance has always beenfragile, marred by frequent disputes and an almost constant lack ofcooperation.   But the announcement of a break in that alliance Tuesday nightby seven Southern Front field commanders highlighted anew thegrowing turmoil within the Contra organization brought about bylast year's congressional decision to end U.S. aid.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi is a ``a thug in acongressman's suit,'' a prosecutor said Wednesday in closingarguments at the Wedtech corruption trial.   During a summation expected to last two days, Assistant U.S.Attorney Edward J. Little said Biaggi extorted nearly $4 million inWedtech stock in exchange for helping the company secure defensecontracts.   ``We're talking about official extortion,'' said Little.``Congressmen don't need guns. Their office is their weapon.''   Biaggi, 70, a 10-term New York Democrat; his eldest son,Richard; former Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon; and fourothers are charged with turning Wedtech into a racketeeringenterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtainno-bid defense contracts.  </TEXT><DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Hoover Institution, the think-tankthat generated many of the Reagan administration's conservativeideas, must pick a new leader of its own following a decision byits long-time director to step down.   W. Glenn Campbell's decision follows months of debate about theaffiliation between Stanford University and the on-campusinstitution that will soon be home to Secretary of State GeorgeShultz and Attorney General Edwin Meese III.   Campbell, who succeeded founder and former President HerbertHoover in 1960, said the new director will have to ``be a leaderwho can provide a climate where all these prima donnas can livetogether.''   The announcement came two months after Campbell vowed to sue ifStanford tried to oust him at 65 because it was the customaryretirement age at the university. Campbell had planned on stayinganother five years.</TEXT></DOC>
