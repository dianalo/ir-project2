Yet a common theme underlies the two discontents: anincreasing feeling that Japan has outgrown some of itsinstitutions and practices.</LP><TEXT>   A foreign policy of passive reliance on the U.S. forsecurity was fine for an island nation that needed to focuson economic development -- but is it fine for one of theworld's great economic powers? And should an economic powerrely on a domestic management system stressing cozy tiesamong elite bureaucrats, the industries they supervise andthe politicians who rely on those industries for money?   Increasingly, the Japanese realize foreigners arewatching, and criticizing, these practices. But, ifconversations with a range of Japanese citizens are anyguide, there's little confidence that shifting publicattitudes will trigger meaningful political action anytimesoon.   &quot;I don't think it'll happen,&quot; says a 42-year-old Tokyotravel agent about the possibility of change. &quot;A few peopleup there decide these things,&quot; he says, waving a hand abovehis head. &quot;Politicians and bureaucrats -- especiallybureaucrats -- have the power.&quot;   It's a common sentiment. Japan has had an electedparliament, the Diet, since 1890, and today boasts some ofthe world's most technologically advanced industries. Yet,many Japanese believe the country's political systemmaintains its pre-modern ways. The conservative,business-oriented Liberal Democratic Party has run Japansince the party was formed in 1955. More than one in threeLDP lower house members are sons or other relatives of formerDiet members, according to Japanese newspaper accounts.   Many Japanese believe one-party rule and the broaddiscretionary powers of Japan's elite bureaucrats havecontributed to the securities scandals. Reports thatsecurities firms reimbursed influential clients, while smallinvestors suffered losses, have confirmed suspicions offavoritism. More serious to many Japanese have beenallegations of ties between leading financial institutionsand underworld figures who profited from the 1980s land-priceinflation that drove the price of a modest Tokyo home out ofreach for the average worker.   That such long-rumored practices are finally beingdocumented in the mainstream Japanese press &quot;is good,&quot; asenior Japanese diplomat confides. &quot;Now people know somethingis wrong with the way things work.&quot;   &quot;I don't think we can get along in international societywithout changing,&quot; says a World War II veteran, over lunchwith a half-dozen friends. The &quot;island-nation spirit&quot; thathas shaped many attitudes here won't earn Japan a place inthe new world order, these men agree.   But they don't see any mechanism to force change in theface of powerful vested interests. The dominance of the LDPand fecklessness of the main opposition parties makes theDiet too weak, they say. The court system, which in the U.S.has often forced change upon politicians, lacks suchindependence in Japan.   Three years after the Recruit influence-peddling scandal,the LDP has finally produced a political reform bill designedto dilute the importance of money in political campaigns andthereby reduce factional politics, but no one expects it topass in the present Diet session. Many within the rulingparty fear it will endanger their personal constituencies.Opposition parties are wary, too.   Measures to prevent a repeat of the financial scandalswill also be closely watched. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifuhas suggested that an independent securities watchdog agencymay be desirable (Japan briefly had such a body after WorldWar II, but discarded it after U.S. occupation forces left in1952). Some industrialists have called for studying such anidea.   Critics of the Finance Ministry say bureaucrats there aretoo close to financial institutions to be tough, objectivelaw enforcers. But the Finance Ministry will guard its turfjealously as it tries to meet public cries for reform. Theministry, which opposes the formation of a U.S.-styleSecurities and Exchange Commission, is reportedly consideringforming an internal regulatory organization.   Last year's failure to agree to send personnel to thePersian Gulf was due partly to fear among many Japanese ofany steps that could lead to Japan's re-emergence as amilitary power. Now, Japan is taking tentative steps to showit can be responsibly engaged in broad security questions. Ata recent meeting of Southeast Asian nations and their majorglobal trading partners, Japanese Foreign Minister TaroNakayama proposed that the annual gathering also be used as aforum to discuss security issues in the Pacific region.   Ultimately, many Japanese agree, bringing Japan'spolitical stature more in line with its economic positionwill require a system in which power is transferred amongpolitical parties. A few influential figures within the LDPacknowledge that the party's monopoly on power hasn't beenhealthy. Keiwa Okuda, a senior member of the LDP's largestfaction, has gone so far as to call for joining members ofthat faction with moderate opposition politicians in a newparty to challenge the LDP.   The lunch crowd is skeptical that any such grand schemeswill ever be realized. But one diner admits it's disingenuousto blame the politicians alone. &quot;Each one of us has to takesome responsibility,&quot; he says. &quot;We're the ones who electthem.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
