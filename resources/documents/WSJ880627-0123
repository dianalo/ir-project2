The bid was at the high end of the &quot;mid-$20&quot; a share range that Payless previously said the managers were considering. The Kansas City, Mo., building-materials retailer has 33.7 million shares.    The announcement boosted the price of Payless stock, which closed at $25.625 a share, up $2.625, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.    What remained unclear, however, was whether another bidder for Payless would emerge. A group led by New York investor Asher B. Edelman owns an 8.1% stake in Payless and has requested information that it said it could use in making an acquisition proposal.    &quot;We are reviewing the situation and anxiously awaiting further details of the management-sponsored LBO,&quot; said Corey Horowitz, a partner in Mr. Edelman's Plaza Securities investment firm. He said Payless has twice ignored the group's request for the information.    Monroe Greenstein, a retailing industry analyst at Bear Stearns andamp; Co., predicted that shareholders might ultimately receive $28 a share, if another bidder emerges. &quot;Usually a company doesn't put its highest bid on the table,&quot; he said. &quot;If another bidder comes in, they might raise their offer.&quot; Mr. Greenstein said $28 a share would be &quot;a fair price.&quot;    But Mr. Edelman, who is juggling two other major takeover situations, stands to make a handsome profit if he sells his shares to the management group for $26 apiece. The Edelman group, which includes Payless's crosstown rival, closely held Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc., paid an average of $18 a share for its Payless stake, according to Mr. Horowitz.    A spokeswoman for Payless declined to comment on whether the company has received any other offers.    The company said a special committee of its outside directors will evaluate the management proposal, along with its financial adviser, Alex. Brown andamp; Sons. Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. is advising the management group, and according to Wall Street sources, is participating in the transaction. The company said only that the management group has received commitments to finance the transaction.    David Stanley, chairman and chief executive officer of Payless, is leading the group. Other members include Larry P. Kunz, president and chief operating officer, and Melvin and Harold Cohen, co-chairmen of the Somerville Lumber and Supply unit, Payless' crown jewel.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company with largely borrowed funds. The debt ultimately is repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    The buy-out proposal is management's second line of defense against the Edelman group's overtures. Just days before the Edelman group announced in May that it had acquired a stake in Payless, the company's board hastily approved a shareholder-rights plan intended to shield it from unfriendly suitors.    Payless, which operates a chain of 200 stores in 26 states in the Midwest, Southwest, West Coast and New England, also owns a considerable amount of real estate. One analyst estimates that the real estate alone is worth nearly $500 million. Mr. Edelman has said that breaking up Payless could bring greater value to shareholders. </TEXT></DOC>
