HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Large doses of fish oil can relieve mild highblood pressure and may work as well as some commonly usedprescription drugs, a study concludes.   Many claims have been made about the seeming benefits of fishoil on the heart and circulatory system, but convincing data toback up these beliefs have been scarce and many experts remaindubious.   The latest study, conducted on 32 white males, provides some ofthe strongest evidence yet to support at least one of fish oil'sreputed merits.   Fish oil seemed to work about as well as two mainstays of bloodpressure therapy _ diuretics and the beta-blocker drug propranolol.   However, the amounts taken were much higher than the dosesusually suggested by manufacturers of widely advertised brands offish oil capsules. In fact, when taken at the recommended doses,the oil did not change the subjects' blood pressure.   Other studies have suggested that fish oil can prevent heartdisease by repairing damaged arteries, lowering dangerously highcholesterol levels and slowing the blood's tendency to clot.   Drs. Howard R. Knapp and Garrett A. FitzGerald, the researcherswho conducted the latest study at Vanderbilt University, have beenamong fish oil skeptics.   Both said they were surprised to find that it seemed to work.But they cautioned that people should not exchange their bloodpressure pills for fish oil until doctors know more about itseffectiveness and safety.   ``For the time being, we are taking a cautious approach and notrecommending it as a therapy for high blood pressure,'' Knapp saidin an interview. ``Certainly I wouldn't throw away my propranololand start taking fish oil instead.''   At Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, Dr. Richard Pasternak saiddoctors should wait for the results of several large studies nowunder way before making up their minds about fish oil.   However, he added, ``This research is consistent with otherexperimental evidence, and this is an important break in thatregard.''   ``Fish oil is not not the drug of choice for treatinghypertension, but the study shows that that dietary change canmarkedly reduce our risk of high blood pressure,'' said Dr. MarkMilner of Washington Hospital Center.   According to the latest report, published in Thursday's NewEngland Journal of Medicine, a month of fish oil lowered the men'saverage blood pressure from the starting point of 139 over 94 to132 over 90.   However, to achieve this, they had to take three tablespoons ofherring oil daily. The oil, which caused belching and a lingeringfishy aftertaste, is not widely available because it spoils quickly.   The amount taken is the equivalent of 50 fish oil gel capsules,like those sold in supermarkets and drug stores. Knapp said takingthis many capsules is not practical because big doses of them oftencause stomach upset.   The doctors also caution that people should not substitute codliver oil, which contains too much vitamin A and D and not enoughomega-3 fatty acids. Oily ocean fish, such as herring and mackerel,are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the particular variety of fish oilthat appears to be good for the heart.   The herring oil used in the study was about 30 percent omega-3.The doctors noted that more concentrated kinds of fish oil arebecoming available that may allow people to get fish oil's benefitswhile taking less.   The latest research ``opens the possibility that this type oftherapy may ultimately find a place in the treatment of high bloodpressure,'' said FitzGerald. ``It's an important first step in thatdirection.''   The researchers cautioned that more study will also be needed tosee if fish oil lowers blood pressure for blacks and women as wellas for white men.</TEXT></DOC>
