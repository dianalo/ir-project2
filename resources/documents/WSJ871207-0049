Inflation? Both?    It's no wonder that investors, still shaken by the Oct. 19 crash, are spooked. Anemic November retail sales and a flat first week in the all-important Christmas shopping period raised the specter late last week of a consumer-led recession. And a dollar that hit postwar lows earlier in the week rekindled fears that higher import prices would boost inflation.    In each case, skittish investors sent stock prices tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst five days of trading since the October crash week, closing Friday at 1766.74, off 143.74 for the week and only 28 points above its Oct. 19 crash level.    Some traders and analysts say the Dow has to be tested at its Oct. 19 low of 1738.74 before institutional buyers come back in. If so, this week may provide an indication of the market's direction -- even as new concerns surface about the U.S. economy.    Some investors now have begun worrying about &quot;stagflation&quot; -- inflation and recession combined.    Are they overreacting?    Some investment professionals suggest there may be more emotion than logic involved in the various scenarios. &quot;This is a nation that can be talked into a recession, but if we're going to have one, it isn't evident in the economic numbers,&quot; said William LeFevre, chief investment analyst for Advest.    Others agree. Cornelia Small, chief economist at Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark, contends that consumers, loaded to the hilt with debt, were expected to slow their spending. In any case, she said, there won't be enough evidence to make a case either way until after Christmas.    Like many others on Wall Street, she's betting that if evidence of a looming recession does appear after New Year's, the Federal Reserve will move quickly to stimulate the economy. &quot;Recessions just don't happen any old time,&quot; she said. &quot;Most have been created deliberately, and right now they're trying very deliberately not to have a recession.&quot;    There's even a line of reasoning that holds that a consumer recession that hits housing, autos and financial services but spares basic industry would be good for investors because it would stymie any incipient inflation. Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, suggests that a consumer-led recession would keep enough downward pressure on the components of the consumer price index to offset price increases by basic industries enjoying strong demand for U.S.-made products abroad.    Simultaneously, it would make a big dent in the U.S. trade deficit since many consumer goods are imported. That would take some pressure off the beleaguered dollar.    So what do professionals recommend to ease investors' rattled nerves?    Caution.   &quot;The basic strategy is to assume we've entered a bear market,&quot; said Thom Brown, chief investment strategist for Butcher andamp; Singer, Philadelphia. &quot;Take advantage of the weakness to accumulate stocks you want to be holding three or four years from now, the ones you wanted to buy, but that were too expensive. Anybody who did that in previous bear markets, and was patient, was amply rewarded.&quot;    Merrill Lynch's Mr. Clough recommends that investors stick with basic industries, an attitude shared by David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services: &quot;The dominant theme for America for the next year has to be capital goods, commodities producers and multinationals with big overseas exposures,&quot; said Mr. Hale.    Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at E.F. Hutton Group, takes a classic defensive posture: utilities, consumer staples, health care and insurance companies.    But utilities don't get much of an endorsement from Charles Dawkins, chief investment officer for Aetna Life Insurance andamp; Annuity Co. in Hartford. &quot;Compared to capital goods exporters, they don't have any possibility of exploiting the lower dollar,&quot; he said.    Greg Smith, chief investment strategist for Prudential-Bache Securities, contends that investors should mitigate the risk of inflation by turning to small stocks with low price-earnings ratios and good yields. He said foreign investors, who are likely to sell if the dollar falls further, usually avoid small stocks, &quot;and margin investors were washed out of the category in the Oct. 19 crash.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stock prices fell slightly in moderate trading Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 9.79. Volume totaled 184.8 million shares, down from the 204.2 million shares Thursday. Declining issues totaled 1,306, while 362 issues advanced.    Despite the modest drop, traders said investor sentiment seems to be as negative as it was in the midst of the market's turmoil in October.    Gold stocks were among the big losers Friday. ASA was off 2 7/8 to 48 1/4; Newmont Mining fell 1 3/8 to 32 1/8; Homestake Mining dropped 1 1/4 to 16 1/8; American Barrick declined 1 to 19 3/8; and Battle Mountain Group closed at 18 7/8, down 1 1/2.    Other losers included Teledyne, off 8 to 269; Merck, down 6 1/2 to 153 1/2; Georgia Gulf, down 3 5/8 to 39 1/8; Digital Equipment, off 2 3/4 to 113 3/4; and Holly Sugar, down 3 to 69 1/2.    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph was among the most actives, unchanged at 26. Federal Judge Harold Green reaffirmed his ban on manufacturing by regional Bell companies. Other active stocks were Enron, up 1/8 to 35 7/8; General Electric, up 1/8 to 40; and IE Industries, down 1/2 to 23.    Cigna also was active, down 3/8 at 44 1/4. Traders said investors were buying the stock to capture the coming dividend.    (Revised WSJ Dec. 8, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
