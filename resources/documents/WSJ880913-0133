Data Resources says it's the same one that got stung worst in the last four economic downturns: the Great Lakes states.    The Lexington, Mass., economic-consulting firm has produced a scenario that assumes a relatively severe recession starting in late 1989, with the nation's economic output falling four percentage points by the fourth quarter of 1990 and interest rates surging. In this model, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin would lose 10% of their manufacturing jobs by the end of 1990.    Does all this sound familiar? In the major recessions of 1975 and 1982, and in the less severe slumps of 1960 and 1970, the Great Lakes states also sustained the biggest percentage job losses of any region.    &quot;These states are trying to insulate themselves from swings in the business cycle, but they still have the biggest concentration of manufacturing industries and interest-rate-sensitive industries,&quot; says David Wyss, chief financial economist for Data Resources.    The Pacific Northwest is second worst off under the scenario, but the beleaguered energy states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana have the lightest job losses of any region.    &quot;They're already so far down it's hard to push them down further,&quot; Mr. Wyss says.    Data Resources puts the odds of a major recession starting by the end of 1989 at one in four.    State Budgets Are   Vulnerable to Downturn   STATE government budgets aren't as flush as current surplus figures suggest and would take a beating in a recession.    The National Conference of State Legislatures puts the total surpluses of 49 states that responded to its annual budget survey at $6.1 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.    But 42% of this excess is held by just five states: Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey and Ohio. And the conference predicts the total will slip to $5.5 billion in the next fiscal year. The figures include both general fund totals and &quot;rainy day&quot; funds, money set aside in good years to stabilize budgets when times get hard.    State revenues are notoriously volatile. The tax receipts that account for nearly all budget income are extremely sensitive to personal income growth, which typically slows when the national or local economy slumps. Unexpected problems, such as fallout from federal tax changes, also plague revenue projections.    California's projected budget surplus for the current fiscal year shrank to $38 million in June from $962 million in March. Peter Schaafsma, a California legislative budget analyst, says the state won't know where it went wrong until December, when it examines a large sample of 1987 tax returns. But the chief suspects are an unexpected drop in capital-gains collections stemming from the federal tax overhaul and errors in estimating income from a wider tax base. &quot;We're still only guessing,&quot; he says.    Black Migration   To South Slows   BLACK AMERICANS have moved in great numbers in the past when economic opportunity beckoned. By far the biggest internal migration was the flow of two million blacks from the agricultural South to the factories of the North, which began during World War I and lasted for three decades.    In recent years, that stream reversed. From 1975 to 1980, many more blacks moved into the South than moved out. The Census Bureau puts the net in-migration figure at 194,000. Nearly three-fourths of these southward-moving blacks came from New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and the New England states.    Now, that southward flow seems to be drying up. Census officials say absolute numbers can be misleading because the 60,000-household survey that produces the migration statistics is a relatively small statistical sample. But the trend seems clear. While the South continued to attract more blacks from the Northeast than vice versa in the first half of the 1980s, net in-migration was only about one-fifth the level of the previous five years. The migratory shift could reflect the revival of the Northeast's economy, the recession in Southern states such as Texas and Louisiana, and an unwillingness of lower-income blacks to move as freely as they once did.    Californians Uneasy   About Ethnic Shifts   THE GROWING Asian and Hispanic populations in California are a mixed blessing, state residents say.    Roughly three-fourths of 968 Californians who responded to a survey by the Field Institute, a San Francisco polling group, said Asians and Hispanics are &quot;anxious to work hard.&quot; But about the same number said the two groups will increase the need for public services, leading to higher taxes.    How Californians view their melting-pot population is important because ethnic and racial minorities will likely make up most of the state's population by the year 2000; Asians and Hispanics are the fastest-growing groups. Hawaii is now the only state where whites are a minority.    While two-thirds of the survey respondents say their lives haven't been directly affected by the burgeoning ethnic groups, the future looks less certain. Three-fourths of those questioned said more Hispanics would &quot;likely&quot; mean more crime. And 60% said higher numbers of Asians would probably add to unemployment. </TEXT></DOC>
