ROSENFELD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Taxpayers _ not a bank-financedinsurance fund _ should pay for the multi-billion dollar bailout ofinsolvent savings and loans, according to the president of theAmerican Bankers Association.   Charles Pistor told Iowa bankers Monday there was no alternativebut to use taxpayer money because of the large and rapidly growingproblem of insolvencies of thrifts and the deterioration of theFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the agency that insuresdeposits in Sandamp;L's.   He said Congress should ``accept the facts of life'' that theproblem requires taxpayer support.   Pistor was equally adamant in opposing the use of funds from theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures bank deposits, tohelp foot the bill.   ``The FDIC wasn't created to bail out insolvent thrifts,'' hetold the bankers.   While deregulation has blurred many of the former distinctionsbetween commercial banks and thrifts, each institution has its ownregulatory and insurance systems.   The FDIC insures an individual's deposits of up to $100,000 atcommercial banks and the FSLIC provides similar insurance atthrifts. The insurance funds are supported by premiums paid by theinsured financial institutions.   Pistor, who also is chairman of NorthPark National Bank inDallas, said an ABA committee would recommend today not only thattax funds be used to deal with the growing problem, but that thegovernment step in to halt the growth of the insolvencies and toincrease the pace of liquidating insolvent thrifts.   Pistor said the report to be released today in Washington wouldblame the growth in thrift insolvencies on inadequate regulationand supervision.   The deterioration of the thrift industry and the FSLIC will bethe single most dominant financial issue for bankers in 1989,Pistor said.   He estimated the bailout would cost $50 billion to $100 billion,considerably more than predicted by the federal government'sGeneral Accounting Office. The GAO estimated last week that thecost of merging, closing or disposing of insolvent thrifts would bein the range of $45 billion to $50 billion.   He said that while banks and thrifts were separate entities,``this is a bank problem,'' and the cost of coping with it isrising by $1 billion a month.   ``Bankers across the country are concerned there could be aSaturday night massacre'' in which Congress would merge the $18billion FDIC fund with the FSLIC, he said in an interview beforehis speech. ``We are worried there could be confiscation of a fundbuilt up by us.''   Bankers also are worried, Pistor told reporters, because thepractice of allowing insolvent thrifts to continue operating wascutting into profits.   ``So-called brain-dead thrifts are paying excessive interestrates'' to attract depositors, forcing banks to compete and drivingup the cost of raising money, he said.   ``Our banks feel the pressure when insolvent thrifts build upcredit costs,'' he told the convention.   Over the long term, he said, Congress should bring thriftregulations up to the same standards that exist for banks andshould permit bank holding companies to acquire and operate thrifts.</TEXT></DOC>
