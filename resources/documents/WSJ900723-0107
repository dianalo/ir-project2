The question facing Congress and theadministration now is whose ox to gore and where to gore it.Needless to say, ox-goring is never pleasant or riskless.But, if you're going to gore, you should at least do itintelligently. And therein lies the rub.   Budget negotiators are reportedly toying with the idea ofa securities transfer tax that would levy a fee of up to 0.5%on sales of stocks, bonds, futures and other instruments,with the exception of Treasury securities. The hope is thatthis tax will raise billions, while reducing volatility infinancial markets. There is only one problem with this plan.It won't work.</LP><TEXT>   In the course of its failure, this tax is likely todestroy part of the U.S. financial market, enrich foreigncompetitors, increase the cost of capital for U.S. firms,drive down U.S. stock and bond prices, hurt small investorsand increase volatility in capital markets.   Let's march through the logic. The transaction tax hasstrong support from the British financial services sector.London's Financial Times led its coverage of the proposalwith the headline &quot;City Sees Advantages in U.S. Levy onVolume,&quot; and explained that &quot;if the U.S. Administrationdecides to go ahead with a securities turnover tax, it willhave strong support in the City of London.&quot;   The British are excited about the tax because, if it isset at a high enough level, it is certain to drive billionsof dollars to London. It is easy for traders to shift theiractivities to any market via a phone line and a fax machine.A meaningful financial transaction tax in one jurisdictioncan drive business to other, lower-tax jurisdictions in theshake of an electron's tail.   The natural bureaucratic response is to write rules thatwould gather the tax regardless of where the relevanttransaction takes place. But even bureaucrats who might becharged with this Herculean task know they would fail.   The Congressional Budget Office recognizes, for example,that the tax &quot;would be difficult to administer.&quot; The CBOallows that &quot;it would be difficult for the IRS to audit thesetransactions, so compliance would be low.&quot; The staff of theJoint Committee on Taxation joins in the chorus, explainingcautiously that it &quot;may prove difficult to exert jurisdictionover foreign situs transfers,&quot; and that &quot;transactions byU.S.-owned foreign intermediaries could present significantavoidance possibilities. Broadening the base of the tax toinclude such intermediaries may entail modifying taxtreaties.&quot;   English translation: If the government adopts this tax itwon't be able to collect a big piece of it. Even an army ofbureaucrats producing a mind-numbing blizzard of regulationswould fail. An informal survey shows that tax lawyers havealready come up with several ideas for legally avoiding thetax. One example involves setting up investment vehiclesoffshore. U.S. taxpayers would hold interests in thesevehicles for relatively long periods of time, but thevehicles' portfolios would trade rapidly in newly designedforeign securities that would be carefully structured tomimic highly taxed U.S. stocks and bonds. To reach thesetransactions, American authorities would have to tax foreignentities trading foreign securities in foreign markets. Goodluck.   History unfortunately demonstrates that the government hasthe gumption to embark on such pointless ventures. Recall theInterest Equalization Tax adopted during the Kennedyadministration and the baroque set of regulations designed toprevent capital flight in connection with that tax. Thatill-fated experiment created the Eurodollar market -- amarket that is today the backbone of Europe's financialservices industry.   Better yet, compare the American plan to what's going onoverseas. Britain is now eliminating its transaction tax, asare West Germany and the Netherlands. Pressure is building onFrench and Swiss authorities to abolish their transfer taxes.The Swedish transfer tax was recently abolished afterresourceful Swedes successfully transferred much trading toLondon from Stockholm. The U.S. is, at the moment, the onlynation in the world thinking of bucking the trend by raisingtransaction taxes.   But suppose the inevitable doesn't happen, and the U.S.adopts a transaction tax that raises billions of dollars anddoesn't drive business offshore. Is that the end of thematter? Hardly.   To start with, it is important to understand that a 0.5%transaction tax looks &quot;bigger&quot; to the world's capital marketsthan a 0.5% sales tax looks to consumers. On a $40 share ofstock, a 0.5% sales tax amounts to 20 cents per transaction.Institutions, however, pay as little as 5.3 cents per sharein brokerage fees. For these investors, a 0.5% tax on a $40transaction would almost quadruple brokerage costs. The taxis even costlier for those in foreign-exchange and othermarkets that are more liquid than the U.S. stock exchanges.Consider transaction costs in the government securitiesindustry, where primary dealers can earn as little as $312 ona $1 million bond transaction. A tax of 0.5% on $1 millionamounts to $5,000 -- 16 times the primary dealers' income onthe trade.   There's another way a tax on financial transactionsdiffers from a consumer sales tax. A sales tax is paid once,at the point of consumption. In contrast, a transaction taxis like a diamond -- it is forever. It is paid again andagain, everytime a security is traded. To adjust for thiscompounded transactions cost, markets are likely to reducethe current price of all financial instruments subject to thetax. The Congressional Research Service estimates that such atax would cause at least a 9.3% drop in the value of thestock market.   It seems clear that the administration also understandsthe harm its proposals can do. Notice that the proposalsfloating around Washington all exempt federal debt securitiesfrom the tax -- so that the price of Treasury securitieswon't fall while other prices decline. But why would we wantto raise capital costs for the private sector whileeffectively subsidizing federal debt creation. Sauce for thegoose seems not to be sauce for the gander.   As for those who believe the tax will raise substantialrevenue, they are likely to be disappointed. One of theaxioms of tax economics is that you should try to taxbehavior that won't change much in response to the impositionof the tax. Here, the government is considering a tax on oneof the world's most quickly moving targets. Even absentforcing migration, the imposition of the tax will reduce thevolume of trading and lower value of the instruments traded,thereby reducing the Treasury's take.   The bulk of the tax burden is likely to fall on a silentbut solidly middle class group of investors whose wealth isinvested in pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companiesand other collective investment vehicles. It will also weighon charitable foundations and educational institutions, whichwill see the value of their endowments decline and the rateof return on their assets decrease. Hard hit too will besmall investors who want to buy and sell but don't have themeans to make sophisticated trades offshore. This is amiddle-class tax that will be paid out of middle America'spockets. The burden won't fall on Wall Street fat cats.   To be fair, I must mention that there is a theory popularamong some economists that low transaction costs lead to&quot;trend-following&quot; trading rules that exacerbate marketvolatility and promote excessive speculation. In theory thetransactions tax will slow this type of trading, diminishspeculation and reduce volatility.   The trouble with this theory is that it is at least asspeculative as the speculation it hopes to drive from themarket. As the CBO has noted, &quot;The October 1987 crash seemedto be no less severe in Japan and the United Kingdom despitethe existence of {transaction taxes} in both.&quot;   The anti-volatility argument also seems to fall apart onceit is cast in the real world. If traders are able to engagein portfolio insurance in foreign markets, and ifinternational pricing mechanisms transmit that sellingpressure back to the U.S. (in larger, more discrete &quot;chunks&quot;designed to avoid the cumulation of transaction taxpayments), then the U.S. will still experience the priceeffects of portfolio insurance emanating from abroad.   Indeed, because the transaction tax will have to be paidby all investors -- not just trend-followers, speculators andother vermin -- it could well make the markets &quot;choppier.&quot;Investors would be loathe to trade until markets have movedfar enough for or against their positions to make itworthwhile for them to bear transaction tax costs.   Perhaps the best short criticism of a transaction tax waspresented to the Senate Government Affairs Committee inJanuary 1989: &quot;A stock transfer tax has no evidentjustification. It could cause distortions in the financialmarkets, and could cause many investors, particularlyinstitutions, to shift their equity trading away fromorganized exchanges and to foreign countries.&quot; Who could haveanalyzed the issue so succinctly and so well? Only the headof the Office of Management and Budget, Richard Darman.
