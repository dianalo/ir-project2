The possibility also exists for the airline industry, as it turns out, because it too falls under the Railway Labor Act. So, then, while it is highly improbable that a strike by aggrieved baggage handlers at a single carrier would break out into a nationwide airline strike (as we so suggested in our editorial), it is not impossible. And the fact that it is not impossible reinforces the main point of our editorial: that such a law as the Railway Labor Act is inimical to the public interest and ought to be struck down by Congress. </TEXT></DOC>
