The heat treatments and oxygen flow rates simulatedactual sintering and annealing processes used in sample preparation.Evidence of a phase transition in Er/sub 1/Ba/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 9-{delta}/near 680 C is discussed, as well as the implications of the maximum oxygenuptake near 400 C. The impact of sample preparation procedures on samplefeatures is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
