After originating the semiconductor industry and dominating itfor three decades, the United States has lost the lead to Japan andhas not responded to the challenge of regaining it, said the firstreport of the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors.   The body created by Congress last year is made up of industrialexecutives and government experts under the chairmanship of Ian M.Ross, president of ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories.   The report issued Monday also proposed resurrecting the U.S.consumer electronics industry with seed money fromgovernment-guaranteed investments to help provide incentives andaffordable capital needed for a major research and developmentefforts.   A nationwide preschool educational system for economicallydisadvantaged 4-year-olds would be a step toward improving thequality of worker education, the report said.   ``For every dollar invested in quality preschool, seven arereturned to society during the lifetime of the child in the form ofincreased earnings, less crime and less welfare,'' the committeesaid.   It also recommended subsidized literacy programs, permanent taxconcessions for research and easing of limits on tax-freeretirement savings accounts known as IRAs.   The 30-page report also included recommendations for overtakingJapan in semiconductors such as pressure for reciprocal treatmentin market access, threat of sanctions against unfair trade andrelaxing of U.S. antitrust laws.   Ironically, many of the recommendations paralleled Japaneseadvice for sharpening U.S. competitiveness in the two countries'ongoing economic structural talks, such as better education andhigher savings.   If the U.S. position in semiconductors continues to deteriorate,the U.S. electronics industry will be at the mercy of foreignsuppliers, jeopardizing millions of jobs, billions of dollars oftax revenue, industrial strength and national defense, the reportsaid.   The shift to importing most U.S. consumer electronics items suchas television sets and audio equipment from Asia has beenunderrated as a factor in deterioration of semiconductorleadership, the study said.   It said the government should take the lead in establishing afor-profit Consumer Electronics Capital Corporation to resurrectthe domestic industry with a multi-billion dollar pool of low-cost,long-term private investments.</TEXT></DOC>
