Observations are described to characterizethe atomistic defects present in Mg-PSZ. TEM is applied to study phasestability and transformation in Y-TZP. The nucleation of stable m-ZrO{sub2} at stress singularities associated with grain boundaries was studiedin situ and related to strains and strain distributions determined byhigh-resolution electron microscopy. The effect of grain growth on themorphological stability of polycrystalline fibers, constrained by a matrix,was determined. Analogous to thin films, grain growth was observed tocause the fiber to break-up into individual grains when the grain-size-to-fiber-diameterratio exceeded a critical value. Calculations show that the free energyof the system continuously decreases as this break-up occurs. These resultsare important when polycrystalline fibers are intended to reinforce amatrix to produce a stronger composite material, viz., extensive graingrowth must be avoided to maintain a fiber morphology within the composite.</TEXT></DOC>
