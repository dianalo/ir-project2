July's $7.18 billion surplus exceeded both the $6.94 billionregistered a year earlier and the $5.93 billion posted in June, theministry said.   Japan's surplus with the United States shrank from a yearearlier to $4.49 billion from $4.79 billion in July 1987, but wasup sharply from $3.63 billion in June.   Exports to the United States rose 4.0 percent from a yearearlier to $7.95 billion, while imports rose 21.4 percent to $3.46billion.   The overall increase in Japan's July trade surplus may partiallyreflect the recent rebound of the dollar against the Japanese yenon foreign exchange markets. The dollar, which began the year atabout 120 yen, was trading in Tokyo Wednesday at close to 135 yen.   A lower yen tends to make Japanese products more competitiveoverseas and foreign goods more costly in Japan.   Ministry officials also attributed the widening of the gapbetween Japan's exports and imports to increased sales ofsemiconductors, chiefly to Southeast Asia, where many Japanesecompanies have shifted assembly of electronic products as a way ofdealing with higher production costs at home.
