Some reasonsfor conversion to propane are: high performance, ability to perform wellin an internal combustion engine designed for gasoline, possible reductionin maintenance cost, and lower price. The economics of conversion inOntario are discussed. The points to be considered in choosing a propanecarburetion supplier are outlined. The characteristics of a good propaneconversion, and the components of a propane carburetion system are described.The major components are: a pressurized, heavy gauge fuel tank; a filter/fuelock,which removes foreign matter from the liquid fuel and which automaticallyshuts off the propane flow when necessary; a converter/regulator forreducing the pressure of the fuel; and a carburetor, which meters andmixes fuel and air for proper combustion. Ontario regulations and applicablestandards are introduced where appropriate. Routine operation of propanevehicles is much like operating a gasoline powered vehicle, but attentionneeds to be paid to two areas: engine lugging on manual transmissionvehicles, and engine warmup. Routine maintenance is also discussed. Commontypes of propane fuel dispensers and service station equipment are explained.The booklet concludes by giving regluations and standards applicableto propane carburation, and specifications for light vehicle propaneconversion. 44 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
