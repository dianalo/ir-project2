(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wisconsin's governor called on the federalgovernment Monday to help pay for security provided at lakes whereChippewa Indians spearfish under the guarantee of 19th centurytreaties.   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said the arrests of more than 170non-Indian protesters during the Indians' spring spearfishingseason, which essentially ended Sunday after two weeks, signaledthe need for federal intervention.   ``I can't imagine that the federal officials would want to seethis situation continue,'' Thompson said.   The Republican governor met with reporters before leaving forWashington, where he was to meet with Wisconsin congressmen. OnTuesday, he is to meet with U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujanabout the burdens the federal treaties with the Chippewa haveplaced on the state.   The Chippewa began spearfishing two years after a federal courtruled that the tribe retained rights to hunt, fish, trap and gatherwild grain off their reservations when they gave the northern thirdof Wisconsin to the United States. Sport fishermen complain thatspearing fish when they are in shallow water is so much easier thancatching fish by rod and reel that Indians have an unfair advantage.   Opposition to spearfishing grew even more heated this year afterthe state announced it would reduce walleye pike catch limits forsport anglers because a federal court had ruled the Chippewa couldspear up to 100 percent of the fish that biologists determine canbe safely taken from the lakes.   Thompson said the state could not continue picking up the costof enforcing the treaties. The Legislature recently appropriatedabout $300,000 for meeting peace-keeping costs at the lakes thisspring, plus $150,000 to complete reimbursing local enforcement forlast year's enforcement expenses.   ``If this was a state issue, I would figure out a way to solveit immediately,'' he said. ``I would call the Legislature intosession.''   Thompson wouldn't detail what he would discuss with federalofficials. But he said he would not seek abrogation of the Chippewatreaties.   Four of the six Chippewa bands in Wisconsin confirmed Sundaythey have ended spearfishing this spring after two weeks ofenduring racial slurs and rock throwing from anti-treaty protesters.   The tribal chairman of the Lac du Flambeau band, most active ofthe Chippewa spearers, said the continuation of spearfishing amidthe violent protests was a victory over racism and empty promisesfrom politicians.   Michael Allen said the clearest victory occurred Saturday nightwhen an estimated 1,000 vocal supporters of Chippewa treaty rightsoutnumbered the 600 or so protesters at Butternut Lake.   ``We showed that we can, if pressed, outnumber the racists atthe boat landings,'' Allen said.   ``All season long we have shown that racial violence can't bullyus into surrendering the right,'' he added. ``Having shown allthat, we have decided it's time to stop for now.''   DNR spokesman Dave Kunelius said the four Chippewa bands endedspearing mostly because of the weather and the end of walleyespawning, when the fish leave shallow water.   The tribes could spear later in the year or use gill nets afterJune 1 on lakes of more than 1,000 acres, according to tribalordinances and federal court rulings.</TEXT></DOC>
