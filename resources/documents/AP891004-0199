The allegation came to light in a Juvenile Court custody hearingthe day after Marie King killed her 3- and 4-year-old daughterswith a 10-inch kitchen knife and ordered her son to stab her,investigators said.   The woman's husband, Christopher King, called the stateDepartment of Health and Rehabilitative Services last month, sayingshe had threatened to poison all four children, said Pablo Perez, adepartment lawyer.   Mrs. King, 32, denied the threat when confronted by socialworkers, Perez said.   Christopher King then refused state services, saying he neededhis wife at home to take care of the children while he worked, saidRuben Betancourt, a spokesman for the department.   The department's investigation remained open, and Betancourtsaid agency procedures were followed.   ``We started an investigation at the father's request on theaccusation that the mother was threatening the children. We wentand talked to the mother, talked to the father, talked to thechildren, who were happy, well-fed,'' Betancourt said.   Neighbors said Mrs. King rarely left the two-bedroom house sincethe family moved in a few months ago. Her husband attended twoneighborhood Crime Watch meetings, and the children frequently wereseen playing outside.   Judge Seymour Gelber said the agency's handling of the matterwas appropriate. ``It appears HRS did what it should have done,''he said. ``So this was not a case where HRS failed to follow up.''   The state agency went to court Wednesday for custody of the8-year-old and his 6-year-old brother after the father refused toallow medical and psychological evaluations of the boys, Perez said.   The judge granted the agency custody, and the boys were placedin a temporary state shelter, Betancourt said.</TEXT></DOC>
