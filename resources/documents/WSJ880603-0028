An upsurge in commodities in general also was a bullish factor, analysts said.    July delivery copper posted a 8.20-cents-a-pound gain to $1.0175. It traded as high as $l.02, just 1/2 cent from its life-of-contract high.    New York futures started strongly following a surge in London aluminum futures. In London, the premium of the cash, or spot, position in aluminum rose to $1,250 a metric ton over the three-months contract, from $929 Wednesday.    Analysts pointed out there is no direct relationship between aluminum and copper and replacement of one with the other occurs only in minor areas. But, one analyst said, &quot;the speculative environment&quot; generated by aluminum in London was so frenzied that it carried over into the copper market.    William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York, said traders who had previously sold copper short in London yesterday decided to buy back positions. &quot;There's a fear of being caught short with a wild market like aluminum around,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said.    A minor factor, Mr. O'Neill said, was a news report that a Peruvian metal producer, Centromin, will declare itself unable to meet commitments on some copper deliveries because of a strike at a Peruvian mine.    &quot;That strike's been on since April, so it caught no one by surprise,&quot; he said.    After the close, another news report quoted Peruvian mining officials as denying they couldn't meet commitments.    The renewed speculative demand boosted prices so sharply because of relatively few sellers, according to Mr. O'Neill. As trading started yesterday, open interest in copper futures -- contracts that remain to be liquidated by an opposite trade or delivery of the commodity -- stood at 29,566 contracts.    &quot;That's down from close to 90,000 contracts a year ago,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said, reflecting a significant absence of trade and general commercial use of the market to hedge cash-market activity.    &quot;When a speculative surge like the one we had yesterday entered the ring, there wasn't the usual trade and industry selling to counter it, and this helped prices to rise sharply,&quot; he said.    Michael Frawley, metals trader for PaineWebber Inc., said that besides aluminum, the general upsurge in commodity prices was a factor in copper.    &quot;This rally caught many people who were short because they expected copper demand to slow down for the summer months,&quot; Mr. Frawley said. &quot;As traders bought back contracts they became part of the demand fueling the rally,&quot; he said.    &quot;Industrialized economies world-wide are strong, and while copper demand may not improve greatly, it's exceeding previous expectations,&quot; Mr. Frawley said. &quot;There's a distinct possibility that the July price could rise to a new high of $1.10.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices jumped as several meteorologists trimmed their estimates of rainfall from a Midwest storm system. Jim Roemer of Des Moines, Iowa-based Weather Trades Inc. told clients during the trading session yesterday that he expected only one-tenth of an inch to one-half inch of rain, instead of his earlier forecast for up to three-quarters of an inch of rain. The rally surprised traders; most had expected grain and soybean futures prices to open lower on profit-taking. Forecasts for a continuation of generally dry weather next week are pushing some analysts closer to cutting their yield estimates of the recently planted corn and soybean crops. Steve Freed, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago, said corn yield could drop 5% if dry weather stays past mid-June, which is when moisture requirements for corn plants rises. Normal corn yield is about 121 bushels an acre. Soybean futures prices were also buoyed by reports of Eastern European countries buying soybean meal from Argentina. Wheat futures prices also rose.    PRECIOUS METALS: The upsurge in precious metals continued, this time led by silver, with gold joining in late in the day. July silver rose 4.40 cents an ounce to $7.3050. August gold advanced $9.10 an ounce to $471.50. Platinum for July delivery was up $5.10 an ounce to $628. The focus was on platinum early in the day as profit-taking in Tokyo, following the recent strong run-up, depressed prices. The New York July platinum price fell to as low as $603, down almost $20 from Wednesday's close. Traders were heartened by buying support just above $600, however, and platinum recovered by early afternoon. That rebound, plus strong grain and soybean markets and a higher Commodity Research Bureau index -- all regarded as potentially signaling stepped-up inflation -- combined to spark demand for silver, which earlier had followed platinum down. As silver broke above key resistance levels of $7 and $7.20, further demand was touched off, accelerating the advance. In the last 15 minutes or so, trading for gold spurted as well, analysts said. According to one analyst, demand for gold bullion itself, which had been quiet for a long time, picked up somewhat.    COFFEE: Speculative short-covering that began early in the week continued to firm futures prices. July delivery futures rose 1.41 cents a pound to $1.3488. According to one green coffee dealer, cold temperatures that hit the Parana, the southernmost coffee-growing region of Brazil, early this week didn't cause any damage and a warming trend is expected to begin today. However, the dealer noted, the low readings in Brazil prompted demand for futures contracts because Brazil has now entered its frost-prone period that will last until the end of August. During this period, traders are very sensitive to any reports of adverse weather. Many computer-based funds had previously sold the market short and have been buying back contracts since Tuesday, according to the dealer. That demand continued yesterday, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
