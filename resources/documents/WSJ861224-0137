The day after the holiday, while inspecting his ready-to-pick crop, Mr. Kraus was outraged to find muddy tire tracks tracing a path around five acres of trees -- and not a grapefruit left in sight.    Citrus rustlers had struck again.    While the Kraus family was sleeping off its turkey, it seemed, thieves had brazenly harvested and trucked out 20 tons of Star Ruby grapefruits. It was the biggest citrus heist hereabouts all year.    &quot;Those were worth about $8,000,&quot; Mr. Kraus says. &quot;I was furious.&quot;    Now, in this week of good will toward men, Mr. Kraus is patrolling his 1,000 acres of groves with a shotgun at his side, lest any rustlers try to make fruit baskets of his crop at a time when holiday demand is high. &quot;If I catch someone in my orchard,&quot; he says, &quot;they're going to get some trouble.&quot;    Citrus rustlers provoke the kind of rancor here once reserved for horse thieves. Local officials say millions of dollars of citrus is plundered in the Rio Grande Valley along the Mexican border in some years. This year, even the smallest thefts hurt, because farmers are harvesting their first successful crop since the devastating Christmas Day freeze of 1983, which wiped out 60% of the valley's orchards.    &quot;The growers need every orange and every grapefruit they can harvest this year,&quot; says Leslie Whitlock, the manager of the Texas Valley Citrus Committee. To dispel any doubts about the seriousness of the crime, the justice of the peace in nearby Mercedes (population 14,000) recently set bail at $5,500 for a man nabbed with a trunkload of hot fruit and a small amount of marijuana -- $500 in bail for the marijuana and $5,000 for the fruit, worth only one-tenth as much.    These days, instead of chatting about fertilizer, the farmers swap tips on how to outwit the desperadoes. Some have hired guards. Others have erected hog-wire fences topped with menacing razor wire. One farmer even installed seismic sensors, which allowed him to detect footsteps in his orchard through a scanner in his bedroom -- a ploy that proved too successful. &quot;Every fool kid taking a shortcut through the orchard had him up and out of bed,&quot; Mr. Whitlock recalls.    But in the spirit of the Old West, the hapless farmers are pinning their hopes for justice on a man wearing a star. The citrus growers assessed themselves 10 cents a ton of harvested fruit and for about $16,000 have bought the off-duty hours of Hidalgo County Sheriff's Deputy Dayna &quot;Bert&quot; Hill.    He is the ideal lawman for the job. He grew up washing, waxing and sorting fruit in his father's citrus shed. His fluency in Spanish is indispensable. And the 29-year-old deputy has the unflagging energy and verve of an entire posse in pursuit.    &quot;I take this seriously,&quot; he says.    But on his midnight patrols, Deputy Hill is more likely to discover sweethearts in parked cars than outlaws in fruit trucks. And his detective work often lacks for high adventure. A drizzly weekend finds Deputy Hill sleuthing through ratty flea markets in three counties. In one, a vendor fails to produce the official state Agriculture Department documents showing the origins of her oranges. But the lawman isn't perturbed; these oranges have the glisten of legality, having been through a washer and waxer.    Turning the fruit in his hand, he says, &quot;If this had been dirty-field fruit -- then I'd be sitting on them.&quot;    Out in the field, the challenge of patrolling mile after mile of mazelike orchard is all too apparent. In an isolated grove along the Rio Grande in Brownsville, Deputy Hill points to a small sign, riddled with bullet holes, facing the river. &quot;No entre!&quot; it reads. &quot;Violadores seran arrestados!&quot; Far from being intimidated by the warning, however, some industrious bandits anchored a rope to the sign and sent bags of fruit sailing clothesline-style over the river to Mexico, Deputy Hill's investigation found.    As he ponders the scene of the crime, a speeding car with a cracked windshield suddenly bears down on the deputy. Inside are two mean-looking men, a shotgun glinting between them. For a moment the deputy stands still, his hand on his pistol.    &quot;Que pasa?&quot; the driver sternly asks, his hand on the rifle. Happily, the deputy learns in Spanish that the men are also patrolling the field as hired guns.    But the trepidation never disappears from these isolated fields. &quot;I wouldn't advise anyone to be out here in the orchards patrolling unless they have a radio and one of these,&quot; says Deputy Hill, patting the pistol tucked in his jeans.    Even the most unlikely growers take that advice to heart. When 67-year-old Frances Cross and her sister, Betty Jo Taylor, 60, spied a man on the far side of their orchard loading their grapefruits into his car, they hopped into their own well-armed vehicles and barreled off in opposite directions, circling around and finally trapping the culprit. &quot;We held him there for an hour and a half -- until the sheriff's men got there,&quot; crows Mrs. Cross.    Others favor high technology over high-speed chases. After losing some 35 tons to the citrus rustlers, Texas Agriculture and Mining College is devising a plan to rig a seismic sensor to a siren, which would annoyingly scream over the nearby ramshackle villages where most of the thieves are believed to live. &quot;That way, maybe they'd be mad enough to police themselves,&quot; says Daniel Fernandez, the manager of the school's orchards.    But it is an old-fashioned stakeout one night that finally gets Deputy Hill his man. After sitting for hours, tapping his finger on his coffee mug and shushing barking dogs, the deputy spots a van approaching the edge of an orchard. The silhouette of a man holding a bag passes through the taillights.    &quot;Dad gum, we got 'em now,&quot; whispers the deputy.    Very softly, he radios for backup from the Mercedes police, even though his Ford Bronco, with 293,000 miles on it, is storming the orchard with the quiet and finesse of a charging backhoe.    As the deputy and the police from nearby Mercedes intercept the van and book the disbelieving suspects, they discover a load of contraband -- one partly full box of grapefruits, worth all of $15.    Still, Deputy Hill is ecstatic: He has caught a real, live rustler red-handed, even if those hands weren't particularly full. &quot;I've been out here 49 hours this week,&quot; he exclaims. &quot;It's about time.&quot;    A tow-truck driver, called to the scene to remove the getaway van, is impressed to see the police hauling away the four handcuffed desperadoes. The driver wonders whether he is witnessing a big-time drug bust and points to Deputy Hill, the man who is clearly in command.    &quot;Who's he?&quot; the driver asks a uniformed cop.    &quot;From the county,&quot; the policeman answers.    &quot;Ohhhhh. What'd ya catch these guys with?&quot; the driver asks.    &quot;Grapefruit,&quot; the officer answers, sternly. </TEXT></DOC>
