The vote was scheduled by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, after opponents of the ban threatened to hold up unrelatedspending bills unless a compromise was reached.   Tobacco state senators had said earlier that rather than thestronger restrictions, they would accept a permanent ban on smokingaboard airline flights of two hours or less.   ``We're willing to make that permanent,'' Sen. Wendell Ford,D-Ky., said of the current smoking ban on two-hour flights, which isdue to expire next April.   But he said he would continue opposing a provision permanentlyextending the ban to all flights, language that is part of a billproviding $11.9 billion for next year's federal transportationprograms.   ``This one will take basically a week to get through,'' Ford saidof the transportation bill. That would delay approval of otherspending legislation awaiting Senate approval, he said.   Congressional leaders want to complete work on the transportationmeasure, and 12 other spending bills, by the Oct. 1 start of fiscal1990.   But the author of the permanent smoking prohibition on allflights, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., continued to defend hismeasure and called on opponents of the ban to let work on the billproceed.   ``If they have a case to make they ought to make it and let usvote on it,'' Lautenberg said.   The House voted Aug. 3 to make the ban on two-hour flightspermanent. Tobacco industry supporters have said they are willing toaccept that if Lautenberg will drop his insistence on the broaderrestrictions.   Lautenberg, supported by health groups and airline unions, arguesthat non-smoking passengers risk cancer and other diseases becauseof the cigarette smoke they breathe in airline cabins.   The tobacco industry has argued that there is no convincingevidence that such smoke is dangerous and that there are otherchemicals besides cigarette fumes in the recirculated air ofairliner cabins.   Tobacco supporters in Congress have also said the restrictionswould hurt tobacco growers.</TEXT></DOC>
