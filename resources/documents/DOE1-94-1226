Although thereare relatively great differences between fission track ages and hithertoexisting geological classification, a rough correspondence could be foundat least for three samples. K/Ar-ages which were determined with thesame material are in a higher contradiction to the geological assumptionsthan the fission track ages.</TEXT></DOC>
