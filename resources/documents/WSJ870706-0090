But Judge Ray Dean Linder of the Woodward County District Court reduced the amount of natural gas that Coastal must receive to 75% of the amount under contract, and ruled that Coastal can recover the money it pays to Plains if Coastal ultimately wins a trial on the issue.    The judge told the ANR Pipeline Co. unit to honor its contract while the Oklahoma Supreme Court considers whether to hear ANR's &quot;force majeure&quot; defense, referring to an act beyond the company's control.    In Houston, a Coastal spokesman explained that the company's force majeure defense involved policies of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that have forced pipelines to reduce natural-gas purchases. &quot;We're not claiming an act of God,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;We're claiming an act of FERC.&quot;    Oklahoma City-based Plains filed suit in June 1986 asking for $8 million in actual damages and $25 million in punitive damages from ANR, alleging that the pipeline company refused to pay Plains for all of the natural gas it received under its delivery contract. Plains, an oil and gas concern, claims it lost $4 million in actual deliveries and $4 million in potential deliveries since the dispute began in early 1986.    Plains said ANR refused to pay for &quot;substantial quantities&quot; of natural gas delivered under the contract. The pipeline company argued that a force majeure -- in this case, the decline in the price of natural gas -- excused it from payment for all of the natural gas, Plains said.    Judge Linder rejected the force majeure defense, but allowed ANR to appeal his decision to the state Supreme Court. A jury will hear the remaining issues, including allegations of fraud, once the force majeure issue is decided.    The Oklahoma Supreme Court hasn't decided yet to hear the appeal, Plains said. </TEXT></DOC>
