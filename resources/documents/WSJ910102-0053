Here are some reasons:   1. The cost of construction, expansion and maintenance ofground transportation facilities on the airport should besupported by those who use it.</LP><TEXT>   2. If off-airport businesses don't contribute their fairshare, some other class of user will pay more; e.g., parkingfees will go up.   3. Access fees, especially those assessed as a toll, canbe an incentive to commercial users to make more efficientuse of the roadway by making fewer trips and using smallervehicles when possible. As you observed, off-airportbusinesses have become a major presence in the arrivals area.Their courtesy vehicles are larger than private vehicles,cause more wear and tear on road surfaces, and contributesignificantly to traffic congestion during peak periods.   Off-airport car-rental companies have led the fightagainst user fees by challenging them in court and lobbyingfor special protective legislation. The courts haveconsistently held that these fees are fair, as they arerelated to benefits received from airport operations.Congress should respond to the latest initiative byoff-airport businesses as it has in the past: by allowing theforces of the marketplace to govern the ground transportationcommunity.
