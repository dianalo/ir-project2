In the United States, GRI (Gas Research Institute)has the primary industry-wide responsibility for keeping gas competitiveat the burnertip through development of new and improved supply, end-use,transport and storage technologies. The sharp downward revisions of projecteddollar-denominated world oil prices and the prospects for an early returnto relative price stability of electricity in the United States havemade this task more difficult and critical. Moreover, the ongoing restructuringof the U.S. gas industry has superimposed vigorous gas-to-gas competitionon growing interfuel competition. Because of its funding mechanism, GRImust also carefully consider the mutual interests of the energy consumerand the various segments of the gas industry. In response to these multifacetedchallenges, GRI is discharging its role as portfolio manager for cooperativegas research and development (R and D) investments by strictly adheringto a least-cost energy service strategy under the added constraint offorced ranking of alternative R and D investments on the basis of rigorouscost vs. benefit considerations.</TEXT></DOC>
