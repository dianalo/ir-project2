Vadim T. Ivanov, director of the Shemiakin Institute forBioorganic Chemistry, said he plans to sign an agreement with theMonsanto Co., in St. Louis, to establish a biotechnology laboratoryin the Soviet Union.   Ivanov is a member of a delegation of high-ranking Sovietresearchers attending the annual meeting of the American Associationfor the Advancement of Science.   Research at the biotechnology laboratory would focus on nervoussystem biology, growth hormones to boost livestock production andhelp underdeveloped humans, and genetic engineering to make cropsresist pests, salt and drought, Ivanov said.   Soviet scientists also hope to place an optical telescope with a10-meter mirror in orbit by about the year 2000, although theproposal doesn't yet have government approval, said Nikolay S.Kardashev, deputy director of the Soviet Institute for SpaceResearch.   The Soviet telescope would be far larger than the $1.5 billionHubble Space Telescope, which the United States plans to launch froma space shuttle in February 1990. It has a mirror diameter of 2.4meters, or about 94.5 inches.   Kardashev also said that despite some earlier problems, hiscountry's Phobos 2 space probe, launched last year toward anencounter with the Martian moon Phobos, seems to be working well asit heads toward the red planet.   ``We hope it's OK _ no problems,'' he said. The Soviets earlierlost all contact with a similar probe, Phobos 1.   This is the second year a Soviet delegation has visited theannual meeting of the AAAS, which publishes the journal Science andbills itself as the leading general scientific group in the UnitedStates. Some 10,000 scientists are expected at the meeting, whichconcludes Thursday.   The Soviet scientists cited numerous examples of U.S.-Sovietscientific cooperation in each of their fields, and expressed hopefor more.   ``It's very good improving international cooperation,'' Kardashevsaid.   Soviet scientists also want to boost cooperation with U.S.earthquake experts, especially in fault-ridden California, followingthe devastating quake in Armenia, said Konstantin Frolov, who headedthe Soviet delegation.   Frolov, vice president of the USSR Academy of Science, also saidit was unlikely the death toll from the earthquake exceeded 30,000.   ``Nobody knows now absolutely perfectly how many'' died in theDec. 7 earthquake, but ``25,000 or 30,000 may be so,'' Frolov said.   For weeks after the 6.9-magnitude quake in northwest Armenia,Soviet officials estimated the death toll at 55,000. Late last monththey downgraded it to about 25,000 after nearly that many bodieswere recovered from collapsed buildings.   However, American engineers returning from an Armenia visit saidJan. 4 said thousands of bodies never will be found and said theythought probably 60,000 died during the quake.   ``Sixty-thousand _ this is too much,' Frolov said.   Frolov, often speaking through an interpreter, called theArmenian quakes ``a very sad and difficult situation,'' and said theSoviets want to learn how to speed post-disaster rescue and reliefefforts, protect against earthquake damage, better predict temblors,and improve building methods.   Ivanov, citing the Soviets' interest in cooperative biotechnologyresearch, said the joint Soviet-Monsanto lab would be located at hisinstitute and that Monsanto would help equip it. Members of bothorganizations would be on a board overseeing the lab, he added.   Details haven't been worked out about how profits would be sharedfrom any products developed at the lab, but ``patents should bejoint patents,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
