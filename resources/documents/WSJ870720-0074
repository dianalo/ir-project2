After hearing the verdict Friday from the state court jury in Santa Clara County, Calif., Joseph Dworak, Mr. Osborne's lawyer, leaped to his feet and invited Judge Eugene Premo, his staff and the jurors to Mr. Osborne's home next Friday to celebrate. Formal invitations are being mailed out today.    The complex, three-year-old case grew out of Osborne Computer's unexpected discovery of losses in 1983, a few weeks before the company's planned initial offering of stock to the public. Thirteen plaintiffs, including individual venture capitalists, pension funds and financial institutions, said they invested a total of $4.1 million in Osborne just before the high-flying portable-computer pioneer was due to go public and claimed they based their decisions on misleading financial statements approved by Arthur Young.    Specifically, the investors alleged Osborne Computer, with the Big Eight accounting firm, informed them that the company was at the break-even point while Osborne actually was incurring losses of about $3 million a quarter. The break-even point is a watershed for start-up companies and their investors because it is when many choose to go public.    &quot;The investors were led to believe Osborne would be a second Apple Computer Co.,&quot; the plaintiffs' attorney, Paul Dawes of San Francisco, argued in court papers. &quot;After they invested their money, on the strength of information approved by Arthur Young, they were shocked to learn Osborne had very serious financial problems.&quot;    The jury found that Mr. Osborne and Arthur Young never intended to deceive investors, and hence cleared both of fraud claims. It also exonerated Arthur Young of investors' claims that it misrepresented Osborne Computer's financial condition.    But the jury found Arthur Young liable to investors anyway, holding that the auditors negligently failed to warn Osborne Computer about deficiencies in the company's financial controls that helped cause its demise. California courts, unlike the U.S. Supreme Court and courts in other states, have allowed third parties, such as outside investors, to sue for malpractice when a professional firm damages them through negligent advice to its client.    Of the verdict, $3.2 million will be split among 12 plaintiffs, with the remaining $1.1 million going to Robert Bily, a former Osborne director and confidant of Mr. Osborne. Outside the courtroom on Friday, Bruce L. Simon, Mr. Bily's attorney, spurned Mr. Dworak's post-verdict celebration with a rebuke of the idea.    In New York, Carl D. Liggio, Arthur Young's general counsel, said the accounting firm will ask Judge Premo for a retrial, and failing that, appeal the jury's verdict. Mr. Liggio said there was an &quot;explicit inconsistency&quot; in the jury's findings that Arthur Young didn't deceive investors but was still liable to investors for malpractice.    &quot;By definition, malpractice can only be committed against a client,&quot; said Mr. Liggio. &quot;We think that the court committed an error in allowing the malpractice issue to go to the jury.&quot;    Arthur Young's trial attorney in the case, M. Laurence Popofsky of San Francisco, said the issue of third-party malpractice claims has never been ruled on by the California Supreme Court. &quot;In New York, this verdict wouldn't stand,&quot; he said.    &quot;This is an issue whose time has come for California to look at definitively, and this may be the case to do it,&quot; said Mr. Popofsky. </TEXT></DOC>
