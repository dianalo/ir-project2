Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries were to gather Friday at their Vienna, Austriaheadquarters in advance of their mid-year meeting set to beginMonday.   The cartel's eight-member price monitoring panel was to meetFriday, although ministers from the rest of the nations wereexpected to attend.   OPEC's agreement last November to limit output in order tosupport a price of $18 a barrel for its crude was seen as helpingpush oil prices higher, but several members have indicated theywant to change either production quotas or the benchmark price.   ``They will come to an agreement at the end,'' said PierreTerzian, editor of the Paris-based oil publication,Petrostrategies. ``But it will be rather difficult.''   In advance of the discussions, several ministers have madeproposals for the accord that will determine production and pricelevels for the last half of 1989.   Saudi Arabia's oil chief, Hisham Nazer, has said he wouldrecommend removing the $18 a barrel benchmark.   OPEC agreed last November to limit cartel production to 18.5million barrels a day in order to support the $18 a barrel price,although some nations widely are seen as cheating on theirindividual quotas.   Prices have climbed since the accord, partly due to otherfactors that disrupted some non-OPEC production. Some OPEC nationshave indicated the output ceiling should be raised for the secondhalf of the year.   ``The government of Saudi Arabia believes that OPEC should setfor itself a production ceiling and strictly adhere to it,'' Nazertold the New York Times earlier this week.   ``This will give members a chance to take advantage ofsituations where the price goes above $18 a barrel,'' he said.   Algeria's Sadek Boussena was quoted in Petrostrategies asinsisting on a target of $18 a barrel for the rest of the year.   The average price for a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEChas skyrocketed from $12.34 a barrel at the end of November to$17.67 a barrel last week, although it exceeded the $18 targetearlier this year.   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude, closed down 9 cents at $19.81 a barrel Thursday on theNew York Mercantile Exchange. The near month West TexasIntermediate contract had touched lows in the $12.60 a barrel rangeas late as last October.   This year's price surge has been attributed not only to OPEC butalso to accidents in oil-producing areas, such as the oil spill inAlaska's Prince William Sound, that caused temporary supplydisruptions.   Nick Antill, an analyst at the brokerage County NatWest inLondon, predicted OPEC would lift its production cap by a millionor so barrels, ranging from 19.5 million barrels to 20 millionbarrels.   Some analysts estimate production in April and May was about20.5 million barrels a day.   OPEC reported last week that 12 of its members supplied 17.54million barrels a day into the international market last month,compared with the supply target of 17.51 million barrels.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, analysts say, will bepressing for a larger share of the total in a push that could angersome of the other members.   Sheikh Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, saidOPEC's key issues are ``increasing the organization's productionceiling and sharing out the increment among member countries.''   The International Energy Agency, in its Monthly Oil MarketReport, estimated Kuwait's production in April at 1.4 millionbarrels a day, compared with its 1 million barrel daily quota.   The United Arab Emirates, considered a persistent cheater,produced about 1.6 million barrels a day, compared with its cap of988,000 barrels, according to the oil market report.   The report estimated demand for OPEC would run about 20.4million barrels a day in the second half of the year.   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
