The safety board, in a letter to the Federal AviationAdministration, said it hasn't determined the cause of theMarch 3 United Airlines accident that killed 20 passengersand five crew members.</LP><TEXT>   But it said it was worried that a malfunction of a rudderpart &quot;could cause uncommanded input to these airplanes, whichcould lead to control difficulties.&quot;   The FAA said it was studying the recommendation, which itmay accept or reject. A Boeing Co. spokesman said therecommendation would apply to all 727s, as well as to 737sdelivered before 1988. But Bob Kelley-Wickemeyer, the chiefengineer for technology and certification at Boeing's Renton,Wash., division, said the company is convinced that theaccident wasn't caused by the type of rudder malfunction thatthe safety board is concerned about.   The cause of the March 3 crash of the Boeing 737, whichoccurred in clear weather on approach to Colorado Springsairport, has eluded investigators. But in its letter to theFAA, the safety board said that maintenance records for theplane indicate that &quot;rudder control system anomalies&quot;occurred twice before the accident. In addition, the safetyboard said, it is aware of three other incidents involvingsimilar problems with the rudder on 737s.</TEXT></DOC>
