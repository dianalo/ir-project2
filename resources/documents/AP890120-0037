O'Brien said Thursday.``The evidence was overwhelming that both are loving parents.''   Saying the boy ``is tragically too young to die,'' O'Brien chokedup after delivering his ruling and rushed from the bench to hischambers. He returned soon afterward.   The ruling gives Miriam Soloveichik the authority to determineher son's medical treatment in accordance with doctors'recommendations.   Doctors at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, whereYisroel Soloveichik has been hospitalized since being diagnosed withbrain-stem cancer two years ago, said he probably has less than twomonths to live.   Moshe Soloveichik, 39, the boy's father and an orthodox Jewishrabbi, had sought a surgical procedure to help drain fluid from thechild's brain to relieve pressure.   The boy' father felt surgery ``would prolong the boy's lifewithout exposing him to any prolonged suffering,'' said HowardLondon, Soloveichik's attorney.   Doctors, however, said surgery could be risky and may not prolonghis life.   Soloveichik was ``very disappointed'' by the ruling, but had notdecided whether to appeal, London said.   ``There are few winners in a case like this. This is a genuinetragedy if there ever was one,'' said Christopher Cohen, themother's attorney.   ``The only winner, if there is one, is the boy, in that he willbe allowed to die in comfortable surroundings.''   The boy is on a respirator and fed intravenously. He is unable tocommunicate or hear.   O'Brien's ruling specifies that life support systems now in useare not to be withdrawn.   ``Neither of the parents suggested withdrawing any existinglife-support procedures. This is not what is colloquially called a`pull-the-plug' case,'' Cohen said.   ``There are no reported cases in the United States exactly likethis,'' with parents suing each other over medical treatment for aterminally ill child,'' he added in a telephone interview after theruling.   The Chicago couple, who have four other children and are stillliving together, filed lawsuits against each other last week.   The father asked the court to give him sole custody of the boy sohe could approve the surgery. Doctors at Rush opposed it, soSoloveichik proposed having it performed at another hospital.   In her lawsuit, Mrs. Soloveichik sought to prohibit the surgeryand keep the boy at Rush.   The judge ruled in her favor, against a transfer.   Catherine Ryan, an attorney for the hospital, called the ruling``very thoughtful, very caring ... and correct.''</TEXT></DOC>
