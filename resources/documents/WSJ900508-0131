While nominal, the payout is aimed at attracting newinvestors to the Washington-based long-distance company andrewarding the patience of its current holders, said Daniel F.Akerson, MCI's chief financial officer.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Many institutional investors can't hold the stock of acompany that doesn't pay a dividend,&quot; said Mr. Akerson. &quot;Thiswill help widen our base&quot; of ownership.   Based on MCI's current stock price, the annualized payoutof 10 cents a share will represent a yield of about 0.25%. Incontrast, the per-share yield for archrival AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co., one of the most widely held stocksin the world, is $1.32 a year, or about 3.3%.   At MCI, the dividend question has been a sensitive subjectsince the company began trading publicly in 1972. MCI'schairman and founder, William McGowan, has been opposed topaying dividends because, in his view, they are taxed twice,first as corporate profits and then as personal income.   But since the company began to have positive cash flow inthe 1988 third quarter, Mr. Akerson said, MCI has beenseriously discussing the possibility of paying at least atoken amount to shareholders.   The dividend declaration was viewed on Wall Street as afurther indication of MCI's maturity and strength. Innational over-the-counter trading, MCI closed at $38.25, up37.5 cents a share. More than two million shares changedhands, making MCI one of the most active issues.   &quot;The dividend shows that the company is confident enoughin its cash position not only to make acquisitions, but alsoto pay a dividend,&quot; said Edward M. Greenberg, atelecommunications analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Lastmonth, MCI signed a pact to acquire Telecom USA for about$1.25 billion.   MCI's Mr. Akerson said he expects the company to keep itsnew semiannual payment at the current level for at least &quot;twoor three years.&quot; He said MCI's free cash flow is strongenough to support such an amount, but such recentacquisitions as Telecom USA will probably prevent the companyfrom increasing the payout rate anytime soon. In 1989, MCIhad free cash flow of $225 million. The company said itdefines free cash flow as net income plus depreciation minuscapital expenditures.   Once company executives &quot;sort through the acquisitions,and we make sure we're in good shape,&quot; Mr. Akerson said, &quot;wecould decide to increase it (the dividend) or we could decideto go quarterly.&quot;   Joel Gross, a telecommunications analyst with Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said most investors&quot;don't want MCI to become a dividend company.&quot; He said hethinks they would &quot;rather see the company reinvest the cashin futher growth and expansion.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
