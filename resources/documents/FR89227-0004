A significant number of SAWs traditionallymigrate to the United States only once a year for a few months. If theywere to continue this practice, they would be out of employment in theUnited States for a continuous period of six months, and would thus, underthe previous regulation, lose resident status. Many such workers who wouldprefer to reside abroad and continue their seasonal migrations for agriculturalemployment would feel compelled to relocate to the United States to maintaintheir resident status and would seek year-round employment. Others mightchoose to abandon their resident status. In either event the purpose ofCongress in enacting section 210 to provide for a legal seasonal agriculturalworkforce would be frustrated. Although aliens granted resident statusunder section 210 have the right to physically reside in the United Stateswith unrestricted employment authorization, this rule would allow migrantswho do not wish to relocate to continue traditional patterns of seasonalmigration. It thus conforms with the intent of Congress in section 210by facilitating the availability of a legal agricultural workforce.The Service recognizes an apparent contradiction between section 210(a)(4)of the Act and section 210(a)(3) which provides for a termination of temporaryresident status only upon a determination that the alien is deportable.By allowing temporary residents SAWs to commute ``in the same manner asaliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence'', section 210(a)(4) impliesthat temporary resident status may be lost, as permanent resident statusmay be lost for failure to meet the minimum employment standard for commuters.To allow a SAW temporary resident to retain that status when a permanentresident would lose his, would place temporary residents within a morelenient regulatory framework than permanent resident aliens. The intentof Congress was not to allow temporary residents the privilege of thatstatus and the right to reside abroad without a connection to the U.S.labor market, but rather to accord them equal treatment with permanentresident aliens. This rule thus conforms with the intent of section 210(a)(4)in according SAWs the same right to travel and commute from abroad as permanentresident aliens.Section 211.5(d) was removed as it pertains exclusively to special agriculturalworker category which, via this amendment, has been adequately addressedin paragraphs (a), (b), and (c).In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigrationand Naturalization Service certifies that this rule does not have a significantadverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Thisrule is not a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291,nor does this rule have federalism implications warranting the preparationof a Federal Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.The information collection requirements continued in this regulation havebeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act, and are cited under 8 CFR 299.5. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 8 CFR Part 211</ITAG>Alien commuters.The interim rule amending 8 CFR Part 211 which was published at 53 FR 18259on May 23, 1988, is adopted as a final rule with the following changes.Accordingly, Chapter I of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations isamended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56"> PART 211_DOCUMENTARY REQUIREMENTS: IMMIGRANTS: WAIVERS</ITAG>1.

Section 211.5(a) and (b) are revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 211.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Alien commuters.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, analien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or a special agriculturalworker lawfully admitted for temporary residence under section 210 of theAct may commence or continue to reside in foreign contiguous territoryand commute as a special immigrant defined in section 101(a)(27)(A) ofthe Act to his place of employment in the United States. Such commutationmay be daily or seasonal for employment which, on the whole, is regularand stable. At the time of each reentry the commuter must present a validForm I-151, I-551, or I-688 in lieu of an immigrant visa and passport.An alien commuter engaged in seasonal work will be presumed to have takenup residence in the United States if he is present in this country formore than six months, in the aggregate, during any continuous 12-monthperiod.
