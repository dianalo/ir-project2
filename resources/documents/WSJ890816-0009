The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which has already seized roughly 265 insolvent Sandamp;Ls in anticipation of the newly adopted legislation, will have $50 billion to spend over the next two years to close, merge or liquidate the nation's sick thrifts. To varying degrees, thousands of thrift-industry patrons -- homeowners, depositors, commercial borrowers and the like -- will be touched by the action.    Following are questions and answers explaining the changes that consumers may see -- and the actions that some should be prepared to take.    I have a certificate of deposit in an insolvent thrift that the government is taking over. Should I worry? How much am I protected?    Every depositor is protected up to $100,000 per institution, even if the thrift has been seized. Once the institution has been taken over by the FDIC, it is likely to be sold to a healthy buyer. That buyer would be responsible for your account.    Accounts in separate thrifts owned by the same holding company are separately insured. But accounts in different branches of the same thrift are insured only up to a total of $100,000.    My spouse and I have a joint savings account, as well as separate, individual accounts in the same institution. How far does deposit insurance protect us?    Both the joint account and the individual accounts will be insured up to $100,000. Beyond that, in cases where multiple joint accounts are maintained in the same institution, rules get more complex. For instance, the amount of protection can vary according to whether accounts are held by a parent and a child or a parent and more than one child. The FDIC says it is best to check with the institution about a particular situation.    I have an Individual Retirement Account and a separate checking and savings account. Is the IRA separately insured?    Yes. Congress specifically provided for separate coverage of IRAs, up to $100,000. For example, a depositor with a savings and checking account would be insured for both of those up to a combined $100,000. The IRA would be insured separately, providing as much as $200,000 of total protection at one institution.    When the government sells my sick Sandamp;L, will the terms of my certificate of deposit be honored?    Not necessarily. Last year, the FDIC disposed of more than 200 failing banks and cut CD rates at about 30 institutions. The principal, however, was always protected by insurance.    In its new role as agent to sell insolvent thrifts, the FDIC has sold only three Sandamp;Ls so far. In those transactions, the buyers of the thrifts were bound to honor the CD terms for only two weeks. Then, they could lower the rates, or the depositor could cash out the CD without an early-withdrawal penalty. &quot;There is an interest rate risk,&quot; says Roger Hood, assistant general counsel of the FDIC.    What's the new sticker we're starting to see in the front windows of savings and loans?    The old sticker proclaimed that depositors were protected by FSLIC -- the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. -- an agency that the new law dissolves. In 30 days, all Sandamp;Ls will be required to have ordered a new sticker: an American eagle surrounded by the words &quot;Backed by the Full Faith and Credit of the United States Government.&quot; Even if you see the old sticker on your thrift for a while, the deposits will remain protected by the new Savings Association Insurance Fund.    If my thrift is liquidated -- not sold to a healthy Sandamp;L or bank -- how long will I have to wait to receive my money from the FDIC? What if I have more than $100,000 in an account?    Normally, you'll have to wait only two or three days. Some depositors, though, have more complex claims, such as pension claims or custodial claims that require the depositor to submit records first. It's best to keep those on hand, Mr. Hood says.    Depositors with more than $100,000 in a single account will be paid $100,000 within days. To collect the remainder of the account, they must make claims against the receiver, as other creditors will. As the assets of the thrift are sold, those claimants are paid off, including those depositors with claims over $100,000, but not necessarily in full.    If my thrift has been seized by the government, what are my chances for renegotiating my mortgage? What about my business loan?    Again, it all depends on the management at the institution. If the thrift is in conservatorship, it will continue to conduct business, including refinancing home mortgages. &quot;But if the loan is with a commercial enterprise, I doubt that our people will be interested in renegotiating terms to lengthen the relationship under those circumstances,&quot; an FDIC spokesman says.    My money is in a healthy Sandamp;L. Am I likely to be affected by the bailout bill?    Most depositors are likely to see the rates paid by Sandamp;Ls decline over the coming weeks and months, as the government pumps cash into the sick thrifts paying the highest rates to attract cash. Just yesterday, the board of directors of the Resolution Trust Corp., the arm of the FDIC that will dispose of the sick thrifts, approved the first lump of funds -- slightly less than $1 billion -- to replace high cost deposits at sick Texas thrifts, who are pushing up the market interest rates. </TEXT></DOC>
