Hundreds of civilians have been killed or wounded since theexchange began Feb. 29.   Eight rockets were aimed at Tehran on Friday and three at theIranian holy city of Qom, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.It said the last missile left its launcher at 3:44 p.m., just 16minutes before time Iraq said it would stop shooting.   An Iraqi military communique said Iranian leaders would ``besparing the blood of their people'' if they also observed acease-fire, but if they did not, ``By God, we will make them tastebitter defeat, and we will deal them unprecedented, violent blows.''   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said eightcivilians were killed and 20 wounded Friday, bringing the tollsince the missile exchange began Feb. 29 to 165 killed and 440wounded. Iraq has reported many deaths and injuries, but has notgiven figures.   Thousands of people have been killed in periodic rounds of the``war of the cities'' since the Persian Gulf neighbors went to warin September 1980.   Iraq said its jets raided an Iranian tanker in the gulf andseven cities in Iran, but maritime officials said they could notconfirm the ship attack. Iran said civilians were killed in the airraids.   In Washington, U.S. military sources said Iran had begunbuilding launch pads for Silkworm anti-ship missiles on Abu Musa,one of its gulf islands, potentially increasing its ability tomenace shipping.   There were no reports of Iranian missile attacks after two werefired Thursday night, but Iran said its artillery pounded Basra andother southern Iraqi cities and its warplanes bombed Iraqi troopconcentrations. Iraq said women and children were killed in theshelling.   A military spokesman said on Tehran radio later Friday that Iranhad stopped its ``deterrent attacks'' on Iraqi cities, but wouldrespond if Iraq attacked Iranian residential areas.   Turkey was instrumental in arranging the truce, which it hadintended to begin Thursday. The Turks have good relations with bothsides and represent the interests of each on the other's territory.   Iran had said it would start its cease-fire Thursday afternoon,but presumably continued its attacks when Iraq did the same.   Manuser Mottaki, Iran's ambassador to Turkey, said Friday inAnkara that the Iranians would honor the truce if Iraq did. Bothcombatants had made similar statements while Turkey was arrangingthe cease-fire.   Iraq reported firing 71 missiles in the 12 days, 59 of them intoTehran, and Iran said it launched 29, all but two at Baghdad.   Tehran was safe from attack by surface-to-surface missiles untilnow because it is 290 miles from the border and Iraq did not haverockets capable of reaching it. Iran periodically fired missilesinto Baghdad, which is only 80 miles from the frontier.   Iraq said it developed its own long-range missile, but militaryanalysts say it is using Soviet-made Scud-Bs with strap-on boostersfor added range. They say Iran also uses Scud-Bs, which can fly 190miles without boosters.   The defense officials in Washington, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said U.S. intelligence had not yet detected efforts byIran to move any of its Chinese-built Silkworms to Abu Musa.   Iran has batteries of Silkworms, which have a range of about 50miles, on its shore of the narrow Strait of Hormuz, southerngateway to the Persian Gulf.   It also has fired missiles believed to be Silkworms intoKuwait's main anchorage from the Faw Peninsula, which it capturedfrom Iraq early in the war.   In Washington, the Pentagon announced that the 16th convoyoperation of 1988 had ended quietly Friday with two reflaggedKuwaiti tankers steaming out of the Persian Gulf into the Gulf ofOman.   ``The Sea Isle City and Chesapeake City, which began thesouthbound transit (from Kuwait) through the Persian Gulf onTuesday, were escorted by the guided-missile frigate USS Simpson,''the Pentagon said.</TEXT></DOC>
