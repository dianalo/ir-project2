The shareholder, Morris Cottle of Chicago, said in the suit that the poison pill provision prevents oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr. from offering to take over all of Diamond Shamrock and &quot;deprives stockholders of the opportunity to receive significant value for their shares.&quot; The suit seeks class action status.    As reported, Mr. Pickens' Mesa Limited Partnership and a partner began a tender offer last Wednesday for 20 million Diamond Shamrock shares at $15 each. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange last Friday, Diamond Shamrock common closed at $14.25 a share, unchanged from Thursday's close.    If successful, the Pickens offer, combined with shares already owned, would give Mesa and Harbert Corp., an Alabama real estate and construction company, about 22.5% of Diamond Shamrock's 111 million shares outstanding.    Mesa and Harbert said that following the tender offer, they will seek to acquire the rest of Diamond Shamrock by offering common or preferred Mesa units. However, that offer would be contingent on Diamond Shamrock redeeming its poison pill or on a court ruling the provision invalid.    Diamond Shamrock's poison pill provision allows special shareholder rights issued for each common share to trade separately after a hostile bidder acquires 25% of the company's stock. The rights can't be redeemed after 25% is acquired. If Diamond Shamrock is acquired by the bidder, the rights allow shareholders to buy stock in the acquiring company at half price.    As reported, Diamond Shamrock itself has filed a suit in the Delaware court asking that its poison pill provision be declared valid. Last night, Diamond Shamrock declined to comment on the shareholder's suit. </TEXT></DOC>
