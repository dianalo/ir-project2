Conventionaltechnologies available for subsurface investigations always will be requiredto confirm and monitor subsurface contamination; however, quicker andless expensive techniques are useful for preliminary site evaluations.Soil-gas surveying is a technique that is applicable to a wide rangeof volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under a variety of geologic andhydrologic settings. The most common uses of soil-gas data include planningmonitoring well networks and defining plume boundaries for remedial action.Preliminary screening techniques are effective in selecting locationsfor detailed sampling and analysis. Site investigators can use resultsfrom a preliminary soil-gas survey to drill monitoring wells at locationswithin the boundaries of a VOC volume. Soil-gas investigations also canbe used to identify sources of VOCs and to distinguish between soil andgroundwater contamination. Chemical analysis of soil gases has recentlybeen used to monitor solvent and fuel leaks from underground storagetanks. In order to effectively design soil-gas surveys and interprettheir results, the subsurface transport and fate of VOCs must be understood.These phenomena can have a profound impact on the presence and concentrationsof VOCs in the soil atmosphere. Physical, chemical, and microbiologicalprocesses can be important in determining VOC concentrations in soilgas.</TEXT></DOC>
