(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The mother of 7-month-old twins conceivedunder a surrogacy contract has agreed to surrender custody to theArkansas man who contracted for their birth, attorneys saidWednesday.   The agreement averts a custody trial scheduled to begin nextweek.   Laurie Yates of Ithaca, Mich., and Barry Huber of Jonesboro,Ark., reached settlement late Tuesday, said attorney Kathleen Boyle.   ``Under the terms of the settlement, Barry Huber has legal andphysical custody of the children. They'll reside with him and hiswife Glinda in Arkansas,'' she said.   Mrs. Yates will be allowed to see the twins once a year, saidLisa Vogler, one of the lawyers who represented the surrogatemother in her suit to keep the twins.   ``Nobody was bought off, nobody was bought out of the suit,''said attorney Robert MacAlpine, who negotiated the settlement forMrs. Yates and her husband Richard. ``It was probably the ultimateact of love on Laurie Yates's part.   ``They realized that in their precarious financial conditionthey could never provide the kind of home for the twins that theHubers could,'' he said. Both are unemployed.   Boyle said she did not know when the Hubers would be able totake the twins home.They were placed in foster care on Saturday toprotect them from stress and attention during the trial that was tohave begun next week. Before that, the babies divided their timebetween the two families, spending two weeks at a time with each.   Mrs. Yates sued for custody before the twins were born.   She had a mid-pregnancy change of heart about surrogateparenting and decided she could not give up her children.   Earlier this year, Gratiot County Circuit Judge Timothy Greendeclared the surrogate contract unenforceable, so the trial wouldonly have determined which set of parents was most fit to raise thetwins.</TEXT></DOC>
