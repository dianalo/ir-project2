The plan provides for the combination of Alaska Mutual and United Bank, both in Anchorage, their parent companies and a third subsidiary, United Bank Alaska Southeastern in Juneau, into one holding company and one subsidiary bank. The resulting bank would have $1.4 billion in assets and $1.1 billion in deposits.    Hallwood Group Inc., a New York merchant banker that organized a similar restructuring of BancTexas Group Inc. last February, will organize a stock offering to raise $65 million in new capital for the restructured holding company. Hallwood would get 12.5% of non-voting common stock in the reorganized holding company, which hasn't yet been named.    The FDIC, which acted after state banking officials reported that the two Anchorage banks were in danger of failing, will contribute $295 million to the restructured holding company and its subsidiary bank. The agency said it will provide no more assistance to the resulting bank and won't assume any of the merged banks' bad debts.    &quot;Instead, the bank's new investors and manager will be expected to implement their own strategies for dealing with poor-quality assets and maintaining the bank in sound condition,&quot; the FDIC said in a statement.    Besides the BancTexas case, this is only the second time the FDIC has used this approach to bolster a troubled bank. Generally, the FDIC acts only in the event a bank has failed, selling the bank and its good loans while retaining the bad loans to salvage what it can. However, the FDIC considered this approach to be less costly than letting the banks fail.    The FDIC-approved plan is still subject to the approval of shareholders in the banks' parent companies, Alaska Mutual Bancorp. and United Bancorp. Alaska.    The $65 million stock offering would be made first to current shareholders and would represent the remaining 87.5% ownership interest in the restructured company. Potentially, new private investors organized by Hallwood could end up owning a majority of shares in the new bank holding company.    Alaska banks have taken a beating in the state's depressed oil-based economy. Seven of the state's 15 largest banks are considered troubled, with little or no equity capital to offset continuing losses.    At Dec. 31, about 11% of the loans held by Alaskan banks were nonperforming, the highest percentage of any state, according to Sheshunoff andamp; Co., an Austin, Texas, bank consulting firm. Last year, the state banking industry's profitability, measured in return on assets, was a negative 1.07%, the worst in the country.    Last year, Alaska Mutual had a loss of $41.2 million, and United Bancorp. Alaska had a $32.2 million loss. Losses for each widened in the first quarter of 1987 against a year earlier. In February, both banks disclosed that they were seeking financial assistance from the FDIC for their main bank units because of rising levels of nonperforming loans and shrinking equity. At Dec. 31, the two banks had combined assets of about $1.2 billion, slightly more than National Bancorp of Alaska, the state's largest and financially strongest institution.    The plan will be costly for shareholders of both companies. In a joint statement, the companies said the Hallwood plan would cause &quot;significant dilution&quot; for current holders. Company officials weren't available to elaborate.    Hallwood Group couldn't be reached for comment.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Alaska Mutual Bancorp. shares closed at $1.25, unchanged, and United Bancorp. Alaska closed at $1.75, down 25 cents.    ---   Richard B.
