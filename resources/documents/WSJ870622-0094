At the same hearing before the Senate Banking Committee's securities subcommittee, Acting Chairman Charles Cox of the Securities and Exchange Commission said the agency would propose a legislative definition of insider trading by Aug. 3. Mr. Cox said the commissioners object to the definition contained in a bill introduced last week, but no longer oppose defining insider trading.    Testimony by Thomas Moore of the President's Council of Economic Advisers represented the first time the Reagan administration indicated it would support putting a definition of insider trading into law. He didn't offer a specific definition. The backing by the White House and the SEC increases chances that some definition will be adopted, although such action isn't likely until next year.    The Senate securities panel is considering a bill that would define insider trading as wrongful use or communication of nonpublic information in breach of fiduciary or other contractual responsibilities.    Mr. Moore called the measure &quot;premature&quot; until the Supreme Court decides the case of former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans, who is accused with two others of conspiring to profit from advance knowledge of Journal articles. A decision isn't expected until next spring.    Some lawyers believe the high court may dismiss the SEC's theory that misappropriation of information provides enough basis for prosecution. The agency currently uses the misappropriation theory, fashioned through past federal court cases, to determine a standard of wrongdoing.    Mr. Moore said that eventually &quot;a legislative definition of insider trading would clarify the responsibilities of those in the market -- enhancing investor confidence, minimizing the threat of litigation arising from ambiguous provisions, and thus lowering the cost of capital.&quot; But he added that the Council of Economic Advisers hasn't reviewed the Senate bill defining insider trading.    Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), who along with Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) introduced the measure, chastised the Reagan administration for the delay in making a recommendation on a definition of insider trading. Waiting for the Winans case, he said, &quot;looks like an evasion.&quot;    Mr. Cox told the lawmakers that the SEC commissioners are unanimous in their opposition to the Senate bill, saying it would &quot;impede government enforcement actions&quot; and &quot;create additional ambiguities in the law.&quot; From an enforcement standpoint, the misappropriation theory is sufficient, he said. But he added that it is desirable for Congress to establish &quot;the parameters of insider trading where the public wants it.&quot;    Sens. Riegle and William Armstrong (R., Colo.) urged Mr. Cox to develop a definition that the average businessman or stock trader could use as a guideline. </TEXT></DOC>
