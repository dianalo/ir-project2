HCFA is required to publisha copy of the notice to a State Medicaid Agency that informs the agencythe time and place of the hearing and the issues to be considered. (Ifwe subsequently notify the agency of additional issues that will be consideredat the hearing, we will also publish that notice.) Any individual or group that wants to participate in the hearing as a partymust petition the Hearing Officer within 15 days after publication of thisnotice, in accordance with the requirements contained in 42 CFR 430.76(b)(2).Any interested person or organization that wants to participate as amicuscuriae must petition the Hearing Officer before the hearing begins in accordancewith the requirements contained in 42 CFR 430.76(c).If the hearing is later rescheduled, the Hearing Officer will notify allparticipants.Nebraska SPA 88-7 revised Medicaid eligibility and posteligibility policiesfor a person who is institutionalized or receiving home and community basedservices. The issues in this matter are whether the proposed spousal and family allowanceson pages 4 and 5 of Attachment 2.6-A and the proposed policy for transferringa portion of couple's combined resources to the community spouse on Supplement5 to Attachment 2.6-A violate section 1902(a)(17) of the Social SecurityAct and Federal Regulations at 42 CFR 435.733(c) (2) and (3) and 42 CFR435.735(c) (2) and (3). Another issue is whether the proposed changes areapprovable under section 303 of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Actof 1988 (MCCA) or are protected by the moratorium under section 2373(c)of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 as amended by section 9 of the Medicareand Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987.Until recently, States could not use methodologies in determining financialeligibility that were more liberal than the methodologies used in the mostclosely-related cash assistance program (in this case, the SupplementalSecurity Income (SSI) program.) This prescription was derived from therequirement in section 1902(a)(10) of the Social Security Act that States(with certain specified exceptions) use SSI requirements and methodologiesto determine eligibility for the aged, blind, and disabled categoricallyneedy and medically needy, respectively.  On July 1, 1988, section 303 of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Actof 1988 was enacted permitting States to use more liberal methodologiesin additional cases. Section 303(a) added section 1924 to the Social SecurityAct. Section 1924 is designed to avoid the impoverishment of the spouseof an institutionalized person in order for the person to receive medicalassistance. The amendment generally would permit one-half of the couple'scombined resources, up to $60,000, to be transferred to the community spouseand, thus, not considered in determining the institutionalized spouse'seligibility for Medicaid. However, the amendment does not become effectiveuntil October 1, 1989. Section 303(e)(5), effective October 1, 1982, added section 1902(r)(2)(A)to the Social Security Act, permitting States to use methodologies forthe aged, blind, and disabled that are more liberal than those under SSIfor all eligibility groups except those for whom Medicaid eligibility isbased upon the receipt of SSI benefits or on deemed receipt of SSI benefits.Section 2373(c) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA) as amendedby section 9 of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program ProtectionAct of 1987 enacted a moratorium on adverse Departmental fiscal actionsagainst States.Under the moratorium provision, the Secretary is prohibited from takingdisallowance, compliance, penalty or other regulatory action against Statesbecause a plan (or its operation) uses eligibility standards (other thanincome and resources limitations) and methodologies that the Secretaryfinds to be more liberal than required under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IV), (V), or (VI) or section 1902(a)(10)(C) of the Social Security Act.<T3>However, the use of more liberal policies may not result in a recipient'sincome exceeding FFP limits</T3>.The moratorium provision does not prevent the Secretary from disapprovingmoratorium plan amendments as part of the official State plan. The provisionmerely permits States, without fiscal penalties, to use more liberal eligibilitycriteria during the moratorium period (from October 1, 1981, until February17, 1989) while Congress considers whether Medicaid rules should be tiedto the eligibility rules of the cash assistance programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility Rules</ITAG>Nebraska's proposed change in eligibility rules is to permit a qualifiedperson, together with his or her spouse who is neither eligible for Medicaidnor institutionalized, to assign one-half of the couple's combined resources,up to $25,000, to the spouse. Resources so assigned would not be consideredin determining the qualified person's eligibility for Medicaid. This resultsin the use of a methodology that is more liberal than that under the SSIprogram in determining Medicaid eligibility for certain persons based uponresources. HCFA found this change, though permitted by section 303(a) ofthe Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, not to be approvable underthat provision. This is because the provision only becomes effective onOctober 1, 1989, and then, is only effective with respect to individualswho begin continuous periods of institutionalization on or after September30, 1989.Section 1902(r) of the Act permits the use of more liberal methodologies.However, under section 1902(a)(17) of the Social Security Act, eligibilityrequirements must be comparable for each categorical group within the eligibilitygroup (in this case, the aged, blind, or disabled). Because the amendmentdid not apply to all members within each group, HCFA disapproved it.The comparability requirements of section 1902(a)(17) also apply to groupscovered by the DEFRA moratorium. The DEFRA moratorium only protects Statesfrom fiscal sanctions which derive from violations of certain sectionsof section 1902(a)(10). Because it does not protect States from the consequencesarising from the use of methodologies in a manner contrary to the comparabilityrequirements of section 1902(a)(17), HCFA found that the amendment didnot qualify for protection under the moratorium.<ITAG tagnum="84">Posteligibility Rules</ITAG>Nebraska's proposed changes in posteligibility rules relate to the computationof an institutionalized person's income that is applicable toward the costof his or her care. The State proposes to:andbullet; Increase the deduction for an institutionalized person's personalneeds to include, in certain cases, a higher earned income exclusion;andbullet; Increase the monthly deduction for the maintenance of the noninstitutionalizedspouse from $354 to $475, with the present rate reflecting the State'scategorically-needy income level for the aged, blind, and disabled;andbullet; Increase the monthly deduction for the maintenance of family members,in the case of families and children, from $375 for one or two personsand $75 for each additional person to $475 each, with the present ratesreflecting the State's medically-needy income level.The proposed increase in the personal needs deduction to cover the higherearned income exclusion was approved. The proposed increases in the spousaland family maintenance allowances were disapproved. The regulations at42 CFR 435.733(a) (2) and (3) and 42 CFR 435.735(c) (2) and (3) relatethe maximum permissible allowances in a 209(b) State to the higher of theState's categorically-needy or medically-needy income level. The proposedrates exceed these limits.HCFA determined that the moratorium cannot be used to override the regulatorylimits on spousal and family maintenance allowances. The moratorium prohibitscertain adverse actions against States because they are applying more liberalfinancial <T3>eligibility </T3>standards and methods than specified in section 1902(a)(10)of the Act. However, the income deductions for spousal and family allowancesare <T3>not </T3>a part of the State's <T3>eligibility </T3>methodology. Rather, they are part of the state's<T3>posteligibility </T3>methodology for determining the amount of incomewhich an institutionalized individual will be expected to contribute towardthe cost of his or her care.Section 1924(d) of the Social Security Act, added by section 303(a) ofthe Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, relates the maximum permissibleallowances to the poverty line. This new limit might accommodate the State'sproposed increases. However, as stated above, section 1924 does not becomeeffective until September 30, 1989, and, thus, HCFA concluded that it doesnot provide the State the benefit of its provisions at this time.The notice to Nebraska announcing an administrative hearing to reconsiderthe disapproval of its State plan amendment reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">Mr. Kermit R.
