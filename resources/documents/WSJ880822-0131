The bailout, announced Friday, underscores the severity of Texas' bank and thrift problem and the huge cost of cleaning it up. In the past year, federal thrift industry regulators have injected almost $5 billion in aid to several insolvent Texas savings-and-loan associations. And the net cost of those transactions is expected to approach $10 billion.    Separately, federal regulators have committed almost $5.5 billion in funds to prop up some of the state's largest banking institutions, including last month's rescue of First RepublicBank Corp.'s 40 banks and the recapitalization of First City Ban corp. of Texas. But bank regulators are expecting the banks to pay back some of that aid, thus limiting their net cost to an estimated $5 billion.    With about 100 Texas thrifts still in need of rescue, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, has forecast a $15.2 billion cost to mop up the Sandamp;L crisis here, which would exceed the $10.8 billion, three-year fund granted by Congress for thrift rescues nationwide.    However, the Bank Board has been providing much of its assistance in the form of notes and other types of leverage in an attempt to stretch its cash as far as possible. With Friday's transaction, FSLIC has $8.4 billion in notes outstanding.    The growing use of FSLIC notes concerns some healthy thrifts that fear that acceptance of the notes by Federal Home Loan banks may undermine the banks' funding efforts in the debt markets. Also, under current law, the notes constitute a debt that the entire industry will have to repay through insurance fees and assessments.    Recently, the Senate approved language that would put an $11 billion ceiling on the notes, but House conferees stripped the cap from the legislation. Friday's transaction brings the FSLIC's notes outstanding to $8.4 billion.    The latest Texas Sandamp;L action included three of the highest-flying lenders of the Texas boom years. But all crashed hard when oil prices plunged and the real estate market collapsed. Their owners and top management have long since been removed and barred from the industry and subjected to pending criminal investigations for alleged bank fraud and other misdeeds.    The institutions, Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas and Western Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, both of Dallas, and Independent American Savings Association of nearby Irving, Texas, were notorious for making &quot;back-scratching&quot; loan deals among themselves and for making loans to insiders. To fund this barrage of loans, many of which turned sour as the economy declined, the thrifts raised hoards of deposits nationally by paying among the highest interest rates in the country.    The merger of these three institutions, together with another Dallas thrift bailout unveiled last Thursday, removes four of the nation's most troubled thrifts from the federal regulators' problem list and should help reduce the unusually high interest rates the institutions had been paying to attract deposits.    &quot;I'd say we've gone a long way toward solving the majority of the problems in the Dallas and Fort Worth region,&quot; said Thomas J. Lykos Jr., deputy director for the Bank Board's so-called Southwest Plan, which calls for the merger and consolidation of almost 150 Texas Sandamp;Ls.    But critics feared the action wouldn't provide a permanent solution for the troubled thrifts involved. The newly merged institution begins life with $6.9 billion in assets, but without capital.    Also, they noted, the merger was created only because an acceptable bidder for Sunbelt, Western and Independent American couldn't be found. Regulators said they hope to halve the assets and branches of the merged thrift in a year and attempt again to sell the Sandamp;L to private investors. &quot;They think they're better off with one big insolvent institution rather than a bunch of small ones. But they still have the same problems,&quot; said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., thrift analyst.    But Friday's merger offers some benefits, including better management of an estimated $1 billion or more of loans made jointly by the eight institutions, some of which are the subject of litigation, said Stuart Root, the FSLIC's executive director. &quot;We end up in many cases with the loans all merged into one,&quot; he said. The lawsuits among the merged institutions probably will be settled out of court, Mr. Lykos predicted.    That will still leave the merged institution with significant problems. Sunbelt, which had $2.3 billion in assets, rolled up a $1.2 billion net loss in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended March 31, that accounted for half the $2.4 billion loss in regulatory capital incurred by the nation's federally insured thrifts during that period.    At March 31, the three institutions had a total negative net worth of about $3.8 billion, and that figure is based on some lenient regulatory accounting principles.    The transaction calls for the FSLIC to issue a $2.5 billion note to erase partially the negative capital of the eight merged institutions. In addition, Mr. Root said the FSLIC would provide guarantees against losses for more than $2 billion of troubled assets, including $1.25 billion in foreclosed real estate. The guarantees enable the restructured Sandamp;L to increase its earning assets by about $2 billion and to lower its loan-loss reserves.    Regulators said interest rates on all long-term deposits would be honored until maturity. However, yields on large deposits would be protected for only six months, or until the earliest maturity.    Besides Sunbelt, Western and Independent American, the other Texas Sandamp;Ls involved in the merger are: First City Savings Association, Irving, Federated Savings andamp; Loan Association, Brady, MultiBanc Savings Association, Alice, Texana Savings andamp; Loan Association, Texarkana, and Summit Savings Association, Dallas. </TEXT></DOC>
