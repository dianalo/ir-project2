NEC's SX-X series will be so much faster than American-mademachines that U.S. commercial and government customers may feelthey have no choice but to buy the Japanese machine, said GeorgeLindamood, an analyst at the Gartner Group consulting firm inStamford, Conn.   ``I imagine there will be some fairly severe governmentwrangling in Washington as a result of this one,'' Lindamood said.   The SX-X Series will go on sale in the July-September period of1990, NEC said. That is about the same time Cray Research Inc., theMinneapolis-based world leader in supercomputers, begins deliveryof its Cray 3 models.   NEC said the SX-X series can attain peak vector speeds of 20billion floating-point operations per second. Floating-pointoperations are high-precision calculations on rows and columns ofnumbers.   In contrast, the Cray 3 is expected to perform up to 16 billionoperations per second, Lindamood said.   The computers are being sold in North America by HNSXSupercomputers Inc., a Burlington, Mass.-based marketing companyjointly owned by NEC and Honeywell Inc. They will range in pricefrom $5 million to $23 million and will use a version of the Unixbase layer of software.   Cray Research did not immediately return a phone call seekingcomment on the NEC chip.   The other major U.S. supercomputer maker is Control Data Corp.'sETA Systems Inc. In Japan, competitors include Hitachi Ltd. andFujitsu Ltd.   NEC has a big advantage in supercomputers because it is theworld's largest semiconductor manufacturer and can make its ownhigh-speed logic chips. In contrast, Cray relies on Japan's Fujitsufor the central logic chips in its Cray Y-MP line. The centrallogic chips for its Cray 3 line will come from a small company,GigaBit Logic Inc. of Newbury Park, Calif., Lindamood said.</TEXT></DOC>
