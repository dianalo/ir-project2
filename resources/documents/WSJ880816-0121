If adopted, the cuts would result in an annual revenue reduction of about $201.2 million. But industry officials said a reduction of that magnitude appeared unlikely.    A complaint filed by the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission alleged that Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s current rates produced &quot;excessive earnings&quot; in 1987. The staff said improvements in the economy, lower corporate income-tax rates and aggressive cost-cutting measures taken by the company lead it to believe that Southwestern Bell is &quot;overearning.&quot;    Under the staff's proposal, basic monthly telephone rates would drop by $1.90 to $5.73 for residential customers and by $4.16 to $13.14 for business customers.    Southwestern Bell has 30 days to contest the complaint. The commission is expected to issue a final decision by the end of the year. Generally, though, the agency's staff is viewed as aggressive in its recommendations; the commission has usually approved far more modest cuts for regulated companies.    Dan Hubbard, Southwestern Bell's assistant vice president of regulatory affairs in Missouri, denied the staff's allegations. He said the Missouri operations earned less last year than the rate of return on equity authorized by the commission. He wouldn't disclose the specific Missouri results for 1987.    St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell reported 1987 earnings of $1.05 billion, or $3.48 a share, on revenue of $8 billion. Business growth was generally sluggish in the company's regional territory, which includes the depressed oil patch of Oklahoma and Texas and some drought-stricken farm areas.    The complaint didn't generate much reaction from Wall Street investors. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Southwestern Bell closed at $36.75 a share, down 25 cents.    Edward Greenberg, a telecommunications analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., said such regulatory action discourages telephone companies from reducing expenses. &quot;If the commission is just going to take it away, what's the sense?&quot; Mr. Greenberg asked. </TEXT></DOC>
