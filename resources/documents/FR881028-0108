The existingConvention deals with a wide range of issues such as native land rights,consultation between governments and native peoples in social and economicdevelopment, and issues of employment, vocational training, health andeducation affecting tribal peoples. The Convention is being revised becauseits assimilationist or integrationist approach to fundamental issues iswidely seen as inappropriate and outdated. The OLO has issued the reportof the June 1988 session of the Conference Committee on Convention No.107 and a proposed text based on the results of the meeting. The ILO hasrequested that Governments submit amendments or comments on the proposedtext. These comments will be incorporated into a second draft of the proposedrevised convention, which will be considered at the June 1989 session ofthe Committee. The Bureau of International Labor Affairs of the Departmentof Labor, with the assistance of the Departments of Interior and State,will prepare comments for the ILO. The Department of Labor invites commentsfrom tribal governments on the proposed revised Convention. The revisedConvention is intended to be a broad statement of principles that can beadopted by many countries whose indigenous and tribal peoples face a widerange of circumstances and conditions. Comments will be sought again inearly 1989 as soon as the second ILO draft becomes available.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed this 26th day of October 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Eugene K.

This textis based on the conclusions adopted by the International Labor Conferenceat its 75th Session. Reference should also be made to the report of the Committee appointedby the Conference to consider this item. In a departure from past practice,this report is not summarised in the present volume but is being communicatedto member States in its entirety, together with the record of the discussionin plenary session (see <T3>Provisional Record </T3>No. 32 and No. 36 attached). Only a very small number of changes from the Conclusions adopted by theConference are included in the text of the proposed Convention, mostlyfor editorial reasons. Where necessary, they are discussed below. Specialattention is drawn in this respect to the discussion below of the Partof the text dealing with land rights. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Convention </ITAG>Preamble The text of a draft Preamble is being submitted for the first time. Itappears appropriate to refer in particular to the development of internationalhuman rights law since Convention No. 107 was adopted in 1957, as wellas to other developments which affect indigenous and tribal peoples moredirectly. The reference to the co-operation of other international organizationsis taken from Convention No. 107, with the addition of a reference to theInter-American Indian Institute in view of the valuable collaboration whichhas been taking place with that organization. Article 1 The use of the term ``(peoples/populations)'' reflects an agreement inthe Committee that the question could not be satisfactorily resolved duringthe 75th Session; reference is made to paragraphs 30 to 39 of the reportof the Committee. There did appear to be widespread, though not universal,agreement that the term ``peoples'' should be used if an acceptable formulacould be found to ensure that it did not imply rights beyond the scopeof the revised Convention, in particular with regard to self-determinationin the sense of separation from the State. Part II. Land The test of the proposed Convention is taken directly from the ProposedConclusions contained in Report VI (2) submitted to the 75th Session ofthe Conference. Following its referral to a working party and a generaldiscussion in the Conference Committee, this subject was set aside formore detailed consideration at the 76th Session. The text of the proposedConvention thus does not reflect either the agreements which were reachedon similar language in respect of other parts of the Conlusions, or theelements of agreement which appeared to emerge during the working party'sdiscussions. Governments and other respondents may therefore wish to takethe following considerations into account in pareparing their comments.<T3>Lands/territories. </T3>A discussion was held in the working partyon this issue which is not fully reflected in the Committtee's report butwhich may assist in clarifying the issues raised. Two basic positions becameapparent. First, the indigenous and tribal representatives, supported bythe Workers' members and some governments, felt that the word ``lands''is too restrictive and does not express the relationship between thesepeoples and the territories they occupy. Nor, on a purely practical level,does the word ``lands'' cover elements such as sea ice for the northernpeoples, which are parts of their territories but are not land. It alsodoes not reflect other elements which are inherent in their concept ofterritory, such as the flora and fauna, waters and the environment as awhole. On the other hand, a number of governments and the Employers' memberspointed out that some internal legal systems are based on the concept oflands and not territories, at least where the acquisition of enforceablerights is concerned. Furthermore, the word ``territories'' is used in manynational legal texts only to refer to the national territory as a whole,and its use in this context might raise problems in connection with nationalsovereignty. While this issue remains to be explored fully at the 76th Session of theConference, the Office points out that both terms were already used inPart II of Convention No. 107 and that no problems have arisen in interpretingthem since 1957. It appears that the issues raised during the Conferencediscussion might be resolved if the word ``lands'' were used in connectionwith the establishment of legal rights, while ``territories'' could beused when describing a physical space, when discussing the environmentas a whole or when discussing the realtionship of these peoples to theterritories they occupy. <T3>Ownership, possession or use. </T3>Some consensus appeared to be emergingto use this expression uniformly instead of more limited expressions suchas ``rights of ownership and possession'' (Article 13 of the proposed Convention).<T3>Seek the consent. </T3>The use of this phrase in the Proposed Conclusions(see especially Proposed Conclusion 30) evoked considerable concern amongsome delegates that the right of States to take final decisions on thedisposition of the national territory was being called into question. Infact, it was meant to indicate that a serious attempt should be made toobtain the consent of the inhabitants of the areas concerned before undertakingactivities which affected them. There was no intention to imply a vetopower and no implication that the State's power to decide be limited. Itshould be noted that the continued use of this phrase in Article 14, paragraph2, of the proposed Convention derives from the Committee's decision touse the corresponding text of the Proposed Conclusions without modificationas the basis for the proposed Convention. Moreover, where this phrase wasused in another part of the Proposed Conclusions, it was modified by theCommittee to ``consult fully'' (see Article 6<T3>(a)</T3> of the proposed Convention).   <T3>Surface ans subsoil resources.</T3> While these phrases were used inthe Proposed Conclusions, some consensus appeared to be emerging in theworking party to use instead the concepts of renewable and non-renewableresources. Respondents may wish to take this into account in framing theircomments. Proposed new Point Attention is drawn to paragraphs 216 and 217 of the Conference Committee'sreport, where a proposed new Point concerning indigenous and tribal peoplesin frontier areas is discussed. While no new Article is included in thetext of the proposed Convention, the Office will examine the question morefully for the final report to be put before the Conference. It is pointedout that an obligation for two States, each of which has ratified a givenConvention, to conclude agreements between themselves to regulate the matterscovered in the Convention is well established in ILO standards. Referencemay also be made to Part X of Recommendation No. 104. <ITAG tagnum="85">Proposed Convention Concerning Indigenous and Tribal (Peoples/Populations)in Independent Countries </ITAG>The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, <ITAG tagnum="15">Having been convened at Geneva by the Governing Body of the InternationalLabour Office, and having met in its 76th Session on 7 June 1989, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Noting the international standards contained in the Indigenous andTribal Populations Convention and Recommendation, 1957, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Recalling the terms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the many internationalinstruments on the prevention of discrimination, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Considering that the developments which have taken place in internationallaw since 1957, as well as developments in the situation of indigenousand tribal (peoples/populations) in all regions of the world, have madeit appropriate to adopt new international standards on the subject, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Recognising the aspirations of these (peoples/populations) to controlover their own institutions, ways of life and economic development, whithinthe framework of the States in which they live, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Noting that in many parts of the world these (peoples/populations)have been unable to enjoy their fundamental human rights to the same degreeas the rest of the populations of the States within which they live, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Calling attention to the vital contributions of indigenous and tribaltraditions to the cultural diversity and social and ecological harmonyof humankind and to international co-operation and understanding, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Noting that the following standards have been framed with the co-operationof the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UnitedNations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisationand the World Health Organisation, as well as of the Inter-American IndianInstitute, at appropriate levels and in their respective fields, and thatit is proposed to continue this co-operation in promoting and securingthe application of these standards, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regardto the partial revision of the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention,1957 (No. 107), which is the fourth item on the agenda of the session,and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Having determined that these proposals shall take the form of an internationalConvention revising the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention, 1957;</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">adopts this day of June of the year one thousand nine hundred andeighty-nine the following Convention, which may be cited as the Indigenousand Tribal (Peoples/Populations) Convention (Revised), 1989: <ITAG tagnum="84">Part I.
