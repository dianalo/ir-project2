FDA scientists described irradiation as a safe andeffective process for, in effect, pasteurizing solid foods.As in the heat-pasteurization of milk, they said, zappingpoultry with X-rays, gamma radiation or electron radiationgreatly reduces, but doesn't eliminate, all bacteria. Thus,although irradiated poultry would be safe longer thanuntreated poultry, it would still require refrigeration, justas pasteurized milk does.</LP><TEXT>   Despite FDA assurances that irradiation doesn't make foodradioactive or expose consumers to radiation, the poultryindustry expects consumer resistance to be a problem.   &quot;It would be fair to say at this time that you won't seecompanies jumping to take advantage of this technology, notunless they feel the consumer will buy the product,&quot; saidStephen Pretanik, science director for the National BroilerCouncil, a trade group for major chicken processors. &quot;There'san element out there that is going to fight this.&quot;   Mr. Pretanik said that a consumer-education effort bygovernment and industry is needed to overcome &quot;a lot ofmisunderstanding and misinformation&quot; about irradiation. RogerColeman, spokesman for the National Food ProcessorsAssociation, added, &quot;The issue is consumer acceptance.&quot;   FDA approval had been sought by the AgricultureDepartment, which is responsible for inspecting meat andpoultry products, and by RTI Inc., a Rockaway, N.J., companyengaged in food irradiation. &quot;This will allow industry achance to use this new technology if it chooses to,&quot; saidJames Greene, a department spokesman.   The department is particularly concerned about suchfood-borne pathogens as salmonella and campylobacter, majorcauses of illnesses. Poultry accounted for almost 10% of theillnesses in U.S. outbreaks that were traced to a food sourcebetween 1973 and 1987. FDA scientists estimate that almostevery American becomes sick from eating tainted food onceevery year or so. The illnesses range from a stomachache toan incapacitating, and sometimes fatal, attack.   The FDA already has authorized limited uses of irradiationto inhibit sprouting in potatoes, retard spoilage in produce,and control insects in herbs, spices, grains and other foods.   The latest approval was based in part on studies in whichlab animals were put on diets containing irradiated poultry.Irradiation at the relatively low levels approved reduces thenumber of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria but doesn'tsterilize the poultry, FDA officials said. As a result,poultry products would continue to require proper handlingand refrigeration by retailers and consumers to preventsurviving organisms from multiplying.</TEXT></DOC>
