(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The historic Battery has been sprucedup, the tourists have been invited back, and all but one of theemergency shelters for victims of Hurricane Hugo have been closed.   But the recovery of this 319-year-old city has largely bypassedthe poor, and many families left homeless by the storm 3{ weeks agowonder where they will get their next meal and how long they candepend on charity for a place to sleep.   ``We've been going from place to place. This is the fourth placewe've stayed,'' said Ethel Williams, 77, bedridden with a cold lastweek at the Ebenezer African Methodist Episcopal Church shelter.   Mrs. Williams hasn't been able to return to Ansonborough Homes,a low-income housing project, since it was flooded with 4 feet ofwater by the 18-foot tidal surge that came ashore with Hugo onSept. 21.   Joining Mrs. Williams in her worries was her 78-year-oldneighbor, Rosa Ferguson, who retired on a small pension.   ``I don't know where I'm going to live,'' Mrs. Ferguson said.``The only thing I wish for is they could turn me out to a shelterof my own, that I could find my own shack.''   The two women are far from alone.   The church is feeding about 150 people a day and housing 16,with more expected, said the Rev. Charles McLamore.   ``We're talking about the people who've got no family to go to,got no insurance to repair their home,'' he said. ``Those kind ofpeople that lost everything they had, and a paycheck won't coverit.''   Hugo killed 33 people in the Caribbean and 29 on the U.S.mainland.   In South Carolina, 18 were killed, 270,000 left jobless and50,000 to 65,000 lost homes. Damage to homes, businesses and thefarming, fishing, timber and tourism industries has been estimatedat $4 billion or more.   Federal Emergency Management Agency provides individuals andfamilies with up to $10,000 for housing and smaller amounts forrepairs and rent. So far, the agency has distributed about $4.4million to 2,300 people.   But McLamore says many of the poor will never see the federalaid because they're unable or unwilling to deal with the paperwork.   ``Most of these people who need it, most don't want to gothrough all of them applications and stuff,'' he said. ``A lot ofthese people can't write, can't read, just can't find a decent job.... They (are) just left out.''   The American Red Cross has helped thousands by providingvouchers for food, clothing and furniture, and one month's rent fortemporary housing, said Liz Leopard, a spokeswoman for the CarolinaLowcountry Red Cross. But she said the poor may be unable to bounceback as quickly as middle- and upper-class victims.   ``(It's) the people who are barely getting by in the first placethat really get hit by this,'' she said.   The Red Cross, which housed 90,000 people in 67 shelters in fivestates at one point, had just one shelter open in South Carolinaduring the weekend, housing 40 people.   In the Battery section overlooking Fort Sumter, roofs of statelyhomes have been patched and debris has been cleared and stacked forremoval. Mayor Joseph Riley has invited the tourists to return.   Relief workers say there are many like LeRoy Clifford, who losteverything in the storm and is living at the church shelter withhis blind father. Housing prospects are bleak.   ``Really, I don't know,'' Clifford said when asked where he andhis father will live.   Roxy Hyatt lost her job just before the hurricane. Then, Hugotossed a tree onto her trailer in North Charleston.   ``We've had to hit the free food lines,'' said Ms. Hyatt, whohas two children, Shawna, 10, and Corey, 6. She's looking for a jobbut having a hard time for lack of money for gas, and the handoutsgo only so far: ``Enough to survive, but it's barely enough.''   She and her children got sick from trudging to relief centers inthe unseasonably cold and heavy rains that followed the storm.   ``Shawna and Corey both have strep throat, and Corey has a rashthat doctors say is from the stress of the storm,'' she said.``I've been begging and borrowing to get the money for the medicine... but it still wasn't enough.''</TEXT></DOC>
