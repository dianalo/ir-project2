(1) In a white collar world vitally concerned with productivity,people will probably want to automate as many routine and repetitivetransactions as possible. So the intelligent building of the future couldvery likely make everything from security checks to comfort control entirelyautomatic. (2) In a world economy, we'll need work environments thataccommodate the earth's time zones and cultural differences, permittingfull and unfettered communication any time of the day or night. Thissuggests that tomorrow's building will have to extend its capabilitiesto occupants 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, both on-site and from remotelocations. (3) In an environment that rewards improving the ratio ofoutput achieved to resources used, people will probably welcome systemsthat streamline the handling of both routine and non-routine transactionsthat don't relate to their higher level goals. As a result, intelligentbuildings will most likely make increasing use of artificial intelligenceto help their occupants achieve speedy resolution of exceptional situations.</TEXT></DOC>
