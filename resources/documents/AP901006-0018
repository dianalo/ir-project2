Bush, in vetoing the bill Friday, said the measure ``picks thepockets of U.S. consumers'' by driving up prices to the tune of$2,600 per family over four years.   He said also the bill would cause an ``economic calamity'' byforcing a collapse of international trade talks.   Congress had ignored Bush's veto threats in adopting thelegislation, which imposes quotas on imports of textiles, textileproducts and non-rubber shoes.   International trade agreements regulate trade in textiles andimpose other quotas.   ``This highly protectionist bill would damage the nationaleconomy, increase already artificially high costs to consumers ofseveral basic goods and abrogate our international agreements,''Bush's veto message said.   Disputing claims by the bill's supporters, Bush said the textileindustry was doing well. Domestic production has been up slightlysince 1987, he said, and unemployment in major textile-producingstates is lower than the national average.</TEXT><BYLINE>---</BYLINE><HEAD>Air Force Calls Up 844 Reserve Members From Four States</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Air Force said it had called additionalreserve and National Guard units to active duty to support the U.S.troop buildup in the Persian Gulf.
