 Motorola's 68040 packs morethan 1.2 million transistors -- four times as many as on the 68030 -- andconsolidates on a single chip a math coprocessor, paged-memory-managementunit, and data and instruction caches that are 16 times larger than those onthe 68030.andP;  As a result, the 68040 is nearly twice as fast as a IIfx (15 MIPSversus 8) and 12 times as fast in simple floating-point calculations (3.6MFLOPS versus 0.3).andP;  Four manufacturers have jumped on 68040 accelerationearly.andP;  Radius' Rocket will be the first shipping unit.andP;  A NuBus card, it hasa unique design that lets the 68040 take over the CPU functions, leaving theMac CPU (68020/030) to handle all the I/O.andP;  The Rocket uses standard SIMMsand can be configured with 1 to 128 megabytes.andP;  Radius' software takesadvantage of NuBus block transfer, so the Rocket can pass data across theNuBus at rates up to ten times faster than those of most other NuBus cards.andO;Plus the Rocket has its own PDS (processor-direct slot), so fastdaughterboards can be added.andP;  Radius has even included QuickDraw anddisplay-list acceleration, in software, so the Rocket takes care of graphicsacceleration too.andP;  The Rocket is expected to list for less than $4,000.andO;(408) 434-1010.andP;  iir's NuBus card, the Performance/040 Accelerator, issimilar to the Rocket.andP;  It also leaves the Mac motherboard active to handleI/O functions and uses standard SIMMs.andP;  Second-quarter release.andP;  $3,995.andO;(404) 781-8643.andP;  Fusion Data Systems goes the PDS route, letting the 68040take over the Mac completely.andP;  The TokaMac LC is a PDS card for the Mac LCthat uses the Mac motherboard's RAM while boosting the LC's performancebeyond that of the IIfx.andP;  Second-quarter release.andP;  $2,995.andP;  (619) 481-8427 orCharles Allen (619) 457-0781.andP;  Total Systems Integration's Magellan 040 isalso a PDS card, only this time for the SE/30 and IIsi.andP;  It too uses themotherboard RAM.andP;  $2,995.andP;  (800) 874-2288.andM;Up to Date ...andM;Studio/8, Electronic Arts' 8-bit-color painting package, has just had itsfirst major upgrade.andP;  Version 2.0, which has been revised for the Mac IIsiand LC, now supports the Pantone Matching System and additional file formats.andO;$295.andP;  (415) 571-7171.andP;  Electronic Arts has also dropped the price ofStudio/I, its black-and-white painting package, to $79.andP;  Inspiration, CeresSoftware's &quot;thought processor,&quot; is now in version 3.0.andP;  The latest editionboasts color and improved graphics.andP;  $249.andP;  (503) 245-9011.andM;QMS' Fast Departmental PrinterandM;The speed of PostScript printers has been increasing nearly as fast as theprice has been coming down.andP;  The Kodak Ektaplus 7016, which we described herelast month, points the way to output integration, and the QMS-PS 2000 takespure laser printing to new performance level.andM;The QMS-PS 2000 is a 300-dpi, 20-ppm (pages per minute), Mips R3000RISC-based PostScript unit that can handle paper sizes of up to 11 x 17inches.andP;  Designed fornetworked environments, it includes the type of liveemulation switching first seen in the QMS-PS 410, automatically switchingamong PostScript, HPPCL, HP-GL, and other optional emulations.andM;Built with a modular design, the PS 2000 comes with 4 megabytes of RAM on themotherbroad that can be expanded up to 16 megabytes.andP;  You can add internalhard-disk drives of 40 or 120 megabytes, and an external SCSI port lets youdaisy-chain up to six additional drives for even more storage.andP;  Other optionsinclude a 1,000-sheet feeder and a duplexer.andM;A year ago, this kind of power and speed would have cost you well over$20,000, but prices have dropped, and QMS' list price for the base model is alittle less than $16,000.andM;QMS, Inc., One Magnum Pass, Mobile, AL 36618; (800) 523-2696.andP;  $15,995 (baseconfiguration, pricing of options not set at press time).andM;QuickMail Keeps PaceandM;Following close on the heels of Microsoft's annoucement of Mail 3.0, CESoftware has announced QuickMail 2.5.andP;  Although it's not a complete rewrite,it does pack enough enhancements to make it worthwhile.andM;For mixed networks, QuickMail 2.5 offers several significant improvements.andO;PC users running PC AppleTalk and the QuickMail Client software can now talkdirectly to the QuickMail Mac server.andP;  For users in environments runningAFP-compatible PC network software, such as NetWare, Banyan, 3Com, and LANManager, no AppleTalk card is required.andP;  The PC QuickMail Client software cansend messages to the PC file server that the Mac QuickMail server canretrieve for distribution to the Mac clients.andP;  The QuickMail server's pollingis automatic, and the mail supervisor can set the polling frequency.andM;For Mac users -- and especially their mail administrators -- one of QuickMail2.5's biggest enhancements is the change to a single-copy architecture.andP;  Now,instead of replicating the same message -- and its enclosures -- ten timesfor ten different recipients, the server stores only one copy of each andsends notifications to the recipients, which saves space on the server.andO;Version 2.5 also boasts improved timing options and support for Apple's ComToolbox.andM;QuickMail Remote users who've found a conventional terminal-emulation programmore convenient than QuickMail Remote will be glad to know that Remote nowhas an interface that looks and functions just like that of regularQuickMail.andM;Finally, QuickMail users will see several small but important improvements.andO;Forwarding messages is now much clearer than it was before (losing your jobis less of a possibility, now that you can tell where the message is reallygoing), and address books can be accessed through a pop-up menu.andM;Although QuickMail 2.5 still doesn't include automatic directory updating, asdoes Microsoft Mail, CE has included a utility that the network administratorcan configure and distribute so users can update their systems just byrunning the installer.andM;In the future, CE will introduce a Windows 3.0 client, and it is expected touse its newly acquired Perfect Timing technology to bring out anetwork-scheduling and personal-calendar system integrated with QuickMail.andM;CE Software, 1854 Fuller Road, P.O. Box 65580, West Des Moines, IA 50265;(515) 224-1995.andP;  Ten-user pack, $599.95; five-user pack, $399.95.andM;Sony Means MultimediaandM;Sony has been expected to step to the forefront of multimedia for some time,and it's finally taken the first step.andP;  The Sony Vbox is an inexpensivecomputer/video-interface box that lets you control several Sonyconsumer-level video products from a computer.andM;The key to the Vbox is Sony's ViSCA (Video System Control Architecture)protocols, a set of Sony-developed commands for synchronized control ofmultiple video peripherals, including 8mm VCRs and camcorders.andP;  Apple hasendorsed the ViSCA standard and is developing a ViSCA device driver and toolkit that it will distribute to developers for free.andP;  Both Farallon Computingand MacroMind have already announced plans to support ViSCA in their upcomingmultimedia products.andM;By daisy-chaining seven Vboxes, users can control and switch among as many asseven Sony video devices from a single serial port on the Mac.andP;  Control caneven include zooming the camcorder in and out from the Mac.andP;  By using an NTSCconverter in conjunction with a Sony 8mm VCR, users can easily transferpresentations to tape and can integrate live video into a presentation.andM;The Vbox doesn't bring frame-accurate video editing to the masses, but itdoes suggest that Sony may be the company to bring multimedia into everydaylife.andM;Sony Corp. of America, Computer Peripheral Products Co., 655 River OaksParkway, San Jose, CA 95134; (408) 432-1444.andP;  $249.95.andM;Hard Disk ToolkitandM;A good hard-drive formatter is as essential a utility as a good data-recoverypackage.andP;  Until now, most users have had to struggle with Silverlining.andP;  Nowthere's an alternative.andP;  FWB's Hard Disk Toolkit equals or exceeds many ofSilverlining's capabilities, but its interface is much easier to use.andM;Hard Disk Toolkit consists of five separate modules: a formatter, a microcodeoptimizer, a benchmarking utility, an INIT for removable media, and adiagnostic tool similar to SCSI Probe.andM;The package's formatter is the principal tool.andP;  A low-level SCSI formatter,Hard Disk Toolkit Formatter installs intelligent drivers that can optimizeperformance and, on Apple hard drives, actually increase storage capacity by2 to 8 percent.andP;  The formatter also offers true partitioning, and you canresize partitions without destroying your data.andM;Although most of the other modules in the package will be of interestprimarily to technicians or hard-disk junkies, they're all easy enough formost users to handle.andP;  Although reformatting your hard drive isn't somethingyou're likely to do on a regular basis, formatting removable media, such asSyQuest cartridges, is a common occurrence and a formatter that's easy tolive with is a blessing.andM;FWB, 2040 Polk Street, San Francisco, CA 94109; (415) 474-8055.andP;  $199.95.andM;More MiceandM;Third-party mice and trackballs are suddenly popping up all over.andM;Mouse Systems' A3 Mouse is a three-button optical unit that isA/UX-compatible.andP;  The three buttons can be programmed, so macros can beassigned to the buttons and left-handed users can configure the mouse tosuit.andM;EMAC's trackball, Silhouette, uses a sloped design so the user's hand andwrist are supported, with the ball itself held between the thumb andforefinger.andP;  Ergonomics are behind the unique design.andM;Spark International's Cordless Mouse and Trackball use an infrared signalinstead of wires to get their messages through the ADB.andP;  For long-distancemousing, Spark says, the units can be used up to 15 feet from theirreceivers.andM;Mouse Systems Corp., 47505 Seabridge Drive, Fremont, CA 94538; (415)656-1117.andP;  $169.95.andM;EMAC, 48431 Milmont Drive, Fremont CA 94538; (415) 683-2222.andP;  $99.95.andM;Spark International, Inc., 1939 Waukegan Road, Suite 107, Glenview, IL 60025;(708) 998-6640.andP;  Mouse, $160; trackball, $170.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
