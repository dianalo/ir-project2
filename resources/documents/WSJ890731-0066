The company didn't specify an asking price for the morning daily, but speculation has been that Hearst is seeking upward of $100 million. Lazard Freres andamp; Co., a New York investment-banking firm, has been retained to receive and evaluate any offers.    The Herald Examiner's circulation of about 238,000 daily and 183,000 on Sundays makes it the 42nd-largest newspaper in the country. It has steadily lost circulation, however, to the much larger Los Angeles Times and the growing Daily News. The Herald Examiner is believed to have been unprofitable for at least the past decade.    In a terse statement Friday, Robert J. Danzig, vice president and general manager of New York-based Hearst Newspapers, praised the Herald Examiner's news staff. But &quot;continuing our ownership of the Herald Examiner is not compatible with the strategic direction of our newspaper company,&quot; Mr. Danzig said. Neither he nor other Hearst officials could immediately be reached to elaborate or to say what would happen if Hearst can't find a buyer to its liking.    Herald Examiner managers will continue their attempt to structure an employee buy-out of the paper led by John J. McCabe, chief operating officer, and convert it to a tabloid. </TEXT></DOC>
