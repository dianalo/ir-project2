The Service also proposesthreatened status for one plant, <T3>Eriastrum hooveri</T3> (Hoover's wooly-star).These species are restricted to grassland and adjacent plant communities(valley sink scrub, valley saltbush scrub, and juniper woodland) in thesouthern San Joaquin Valley, California, and neighboring foothills andvalleys. The five plants have been variously affected and are threatenedby one or more of the following: urbanization, conversion of native habitatfor agriculture (ag-land conversion) and related water development, oiland gas development and exploration, livestock grazing, competition fromalien plants, utilization of habitat for ground-water recharge basins orfor disposal of agricultural effluent or runoff, flood control projects,off-road vehicle use, mining, alteration of the natural fire regime, poorair quality, and stochastic extinction by virtue of the small isolatednature of the remaining populations.

Holland 1986)] of the southern San Joaquin Valley and neighboringfoothills and valleys of California. This portion of the San Joaquin Valley,often referred to as the Tulare Lake Basin, contains roughly 2.5 millionacres of nearly flat, valley floor. If the neighboring valleys (i.e., CarrizoPlain, Cuyama Valley) and foothills are included with the Tulare Lake Basin,prehistoric grassland and adjacent plant communities likely totaled over6 million acres. However, 96 percent of the native habitats of the valleyfloor has been lost principally to urbanization and ag-land conversion(Richard Anderson, California Energy Commission, pers. comm, July 21, 1987).The remaining non-urbanized or non-converted lands have been subject tolivestock grazing, water development, oil and gas development and exploration,off-road vehicle use, mining, and/or other anthropogenic actions.The prehistoric composition of the native grasslands and adjoining plantcommunities likely will remain a mystery (Brown 1982), although numerousauthors have speculated as to the composition of the ``pristine'' floraof the Central Valley, inclusive of the San Joaquin Valley and Tulare LakeBasin (Clements 1934, Munz and Keck 1950, Biswell 1956, Twisselmann 1956,White 1967, McNaughton 1968, Bakker 1971, Ornduff 1974, Heady 1977, Bartolomeand Gemmill 1981, and Wester 1981). Alien, annual grasses and forbs invadedthe low-elevation, plant communities of California during the days of theFranciscan missionaries. Today, these grasses, which account for 50 to90 percent of the vegetative cover (Heady 1956) and can stand up to a meterin height (Holland 1986), dominate most grasslands in California. Aliengrasses have outcompeted the native flora throughout much of Californiabecause these exotics germinate in late fall prior to the germination ofthe native forbs, including the four herbaceous species proposed herein(<T3>Caulanthus californicus, Eremalche kernensis, Eriastrum hooveri,</T3>and <T3>Lembertia congdonii</T3>). Consequently, these four herbs generallyoccupy sites with reduced grass cover. Although the stem succulent proposedherein (<T3>Opuntia treleasei</T3>) persists in areas largely dominated by alienplants (mostly annual grasses), the cactus does not necessarily prefersuch ``grassy'' sites. The invasion of grasses has been quite thoroughthroughout much of the lower elevation portions of California. These exoticslikely compete for nutrients and water, and may further threaten <T3>Opuntia treleasei</T3> by providing abundant fine (thin, slender) fuels,which probably increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires affectingthe species' habitat.The five plant taxa largely persist today in three native plant communitiesadjoining the non-native annual grasslands; valley sink scrub, valley saltbushscrub, or juniper woodland. However, these plant communities too have beenaffected somewhat by the presence of alien grasses. Valley sink scrub isan open to dense shrubland dominated by alkali-tolerant plants of the goosefootfamily (Chenopodiaceae, so-called ``chenopods''), like iodinebush (<T3>Allenrolfea occidentalis</T3>) and sea-blite (<T3>Suaeda </T3>spp.). This plant community, which generally lacks or producesa sparse understory of herbs, occurs about the margins of playas and onthe heavy clays of the valley floor. Valley sink scrub essentially hasbeen lost due to ag-land conversion, flood control projects, and groundwater pumping (Holland 1986). Valley saltbush scrub, a scrubland of chenopodsover a low understory of annual herbs, typically occurs on the gentle,rolling hills surrounding the Tulare Lake Basin on sandy to loamy soils.Similar activities, including oil and gas exploration and development,have adversely affected and threaten this plant community (Holland 1986).Juniper woodland, a compact woodland of California juniper (<T3>Juniperus californicus</T3>), often adjoins grassland sites immediatelyabove the valley floor on gentle sloping terraces. Livestock grazing isthe prdominant activity influencing this community.<ITAG tagnum="85">Discussion of the Five Species Proposed Herein for Listing Follows</ITAG><T3>Caulanthus californicus</T3> (California jewelflower) evidently wasfirst collected by Mrs. A.E. Bush near Tulare, although the date and repositoryof this specimen are known (Taylor and Davilla 1986). Serano Watson, citingthe Bush collection as the type, described the plant as <T3>Stanfordia californica </T3>in 1880. Although E.L. Greene (1891) hadplaced most species of <T3>Caulanthus</T3> within the genus <T3>Streptanthus,</T3> Edwin Payson (1923) transferred the species to theformer genus. Dean Taylor and William Davilla (1986) discussed in detailthe appropriate generic assignment for the jewelflower and concurred withI.A. Al-Shehbaz (1973) that the monotypic genus <T3>Stanfordia </T3> should be submerged within <T3>Caulanthus. C. californicus,</T3> a rosette-forming annual herb ofthe mustard family (Brassicaceae), grows to about 1 foot in height andproduces several flowering branches. The leaves of the species have dry,wavy margins while its non-rosette leaves clasp the stem. The flowers aretranslucent white with purple to green tips. Its sword-shaped siliques(narrow, many-seeded pods) attain a length of 1 inch and width of about\1/4\ inch. The shape and size of siliques, together with an absence ofhairs and an inflated stem, separate <T3>C. californicus</T3> from its closest relatives: <T3>C. coulteri</T3> var. <T3>coulteri, C. coulteri </T3>var. <T3>lemmonii,</T3> and <T3>C. inflatus.</T3> The species historically was distributed within thegeneral area bounded by the present-day cities or communities of Coalingaand Fresno in Fresno County, New Cuyama in Santa Barbara County, and Bakersfieldin Kern County (Taylor and Davilla 1986). Previously known from 40 sites,the plant now exists as one introduced population in Kern County and twonatural populations (one in Santa Barbara County and another in San LuisObispo County). The species was not known to occur naturally at the lattersite. A recent status survey (Taylor and Davilla 1986) reported that intensivelivestock grazing, ag-land conversion, and other anthropogenic activitieslikely extirpated <T3>Caulanthus californicus </T3>from Fresno, Kings, and Tulare Counties.<T3>Eremalche kernensis</T3> (Kern mallow) was first collected by CarlWolf in the Temblor Valley about 7 miles northwest of McKittrick alongthe Lost Hills Road in Kern County in 1937. Using his collection as thetype, Wolf described <T3>E. kernensis</T3> in 1938. Although Phillip Munz (1959) at first placedall <T3>Eremalche </T3>in<T3> Malvastrum</T3> in his flora of California, he later concurred withthe use of <T3>Eremalche </T3>for the California taxa in his supplement (Munz 1968).The species, a small annual harb of the mallow family (Malvaceae), typicallydevelops an erect (rarely decumbent to prostrate) stem about 2 to 4 inchesin height. The plant produces white to rose-pink or lavender, hollyhock-likeflowers (Taylor and Davilla 1986). Although other characters (i.e., flowercolor, shape of the calyx lobes, flower size) have been employed in thepast (Wiggins 1951, Munz 1959, Leonelli 1986), differences in leaf shape,pubescence (hair type and density), color-spotting on the petal, and numberof carpels (seed-bearing organs) per flower separate <T3>E. kernensis</T3> from other members of the genus. Contrary to ThomasKearney (1959) and Robert Hoover (1970), Taylor and Davilla (1986) concludedthat the species was valid and that morphologically similar plants oftenconfused with <T3>E. kernensis</T3> were actually male-sterile <T3>E. parryi</T3>. Restricted to the eastern base of the Temblor Range,the species ranges from the vicinity of McKittrick to near Buttonwillowwithin valley saltbush scrub in Kern County (Taylor and Davilla 1986).Oil and gas development likely extirpated the species at the type localitywhile ag-land conversion probably eliminated one other population of <T3>E. kernensis</T3>. Because the remaining four populations exist nearactive oil and gas fields or in the vicinity of transmission corridors(Taylor and Davilla 1986), further oil and gas development in the areaor transmission line maintenance or expansion likely would threaten thesesites. The species, to a lesser degree, may be affected by ag-land conversion,livestock overgrazing, exotic plant competition, and off-road vehicle use.<T3>Eriastrum hooveri </T3>(Hoover's wooly-star) was evidently first collectedin 1935 by Gregory Lyons near Little Panoche Creek in Fresno County. However,Willis Jepson (1943), in describing the plant as <T3>Huegelia hooveri,</T3> cited a 1937 collection by Robert Hoover (thenamesake for the specific epithet) as the type. Later Herbert Mason (1945)transferred the species along with the rest of the wooly-stars to <T3>Eriastrum. E. hooveri,</T3> an annual herb of the phlox family (Polemoniaceae),produces many wire-like branches and small (about \1/4\ inch across), whiteflowers. Standing about 2-3 inches tall, the species has grayish, fuzzystems and is often branched (Taylor and Davilla 1986). Primarily flowersize, and the ratio of corolla tube to the length of petal lobes separatethe species from other <T3>Eriastrum, </T3>although stamen characteristics play a secondary role(Taylor and Davilla 1986). <T3>E. hooveri</T3> was historically distributed in the Temblor Range (Kernand San Luis Obispo Counties), Cuyama Valley (San Luis Obispo and SantaBarbara Counties), and in a discontinuous fashion within valley saltbushscrub and valley sink scrub from Fresno County south in the San JoaquinValley (Taylor and Davilla 1986). Reportedly the species never grew aroundthe borders of the historic Tulare Lake (Kings County). Today, however,24 percent of the historical and extant populations of the species, includingthe type locality (7 miles south of Shafter in Kern County), has been extirpatedby various habitat modifications (Taylor and Davilla 1986). Ag-land conversion,urbanization, conversion of habitat ``for ground-water recharge basinsor disposal of nutrient-agricultural effluent'', and oil and gas developmentthreaten the remaining populations of the species (Taylor and Davilla 1986).<T3>Lembertia congdonii</T3> (San Joaquin wooly-threads) was first collectedby J.W. Congdon near Deer Creek in Tulare County. Using the Deer Creekcollection as the type, Asa Gray described the species in 1883. Greeneplaced the plant in his newly-created, monotypic genus <T3>Lembertia</T3> in 1897. Although subsequent floras (i.e., Munz 1959,Abrams and Ferris 1960) included this species in the genus <T3>Eatonella,</T3> Taylor (1987) maintains that the species is sufficientlydifferent from <T3>Eatonella</T3> and other relatives to warrant placement within a monotypicgenus. This annual herb, a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae),produces several, frequently-branching stems arising from the base. Thesewhite-wooly stems grow to about 10 inches in length and often trail onthe ground. Aside from differences in growth habit, disk and ray flowers,and other minor characters, the presence of dimorphic achenes (one-seeded,indehiscent fruit) separate <T3>L. congdonii</T3> from its closest relative, <T3>Eatonella nivea</T3> from the Great Basin (Taylor 1987). Associatedwith valley saltbush scrub, only 12 populations of <T3>L. congdonii </T3>remain in the San Joaquin Valley and adjoining foothillsfrom the vicinity of Panoche Pass (San Benito County) southeasterly toCaliente Creek east of Bakersfield (Kern County) (Taylor 1987). Anotherseven populations occur to the southwest in the Cuyama Valley (San LuisObispo and Santa Barbara Counties) and Carrizo Plain (San Luis Obispo County.Primarily as a result of ag-land conversion, 33 populations or 63 percentof the 52 historical and extant populations of the species have been lost(Taylor 1987). Ag-land conversion, urbanization, gravel and sand extraction,oil and gas development, continued overgrazing, and off-road vehicle usethreaten the remaining stands of <T3>L. congdonii.</T3><T3>Opuntia treleasei </T3>(Bakersfield cactus) evidently was first collectedeast of the community of Caliente in Kern County by William Trelease in1892. After cultivating this collection in the Missouri Botanical Garden,John Coulter (1896) described the species using this garden material asthe type. James Toumey in Bailey's Cyclopedia of Horticulture combinedthe species as a variety of the widespread <T3>O. basilaris </T3>in 1901. David Griffiths and Raleigh Hare describedthe long-spiny form of the species from along the Kern River bluffs as<T3>O. treleasei </T3>var. <T3>kernii</T3> in 1906. Although Munz (1959) and Lyman Benson (1969 and1982) continued to treat the Bakersfield cactus as <T3>O. basilaris </T3>var. <T3>treleasei,</T3> recent work by Charlotte Chamberlain (U.S. Corps ofEngineers 1986) concluded that the <T3>O. treleasei </T3>is morphologically distinct from <T3>O. basilaris. O. treleasei, </T3>a low-growing cactus (Cactaceae) thattypically spreads to form extensive thickets, generally develops beavertail-likepads (flattened stems) 3 to 4 inches wide by 5 to 7 inches long. The areoles(eye-spots) are never depressed but flush with the pad surface or somewhatraised. All areoles have spines, although they vary in number and length.Unlike <T3>O. basilaris,</T3> the surface of the pads, which are nearly cylindricalat the base, is not papillate (covered with numerous small protuberances).Although the large magenta flowers of <T3>O. treleasei</T3> appear identical to <T3>O. basilaris,</T3> the characters cited above clearly separate thesetwo taxa as species. Found chiefly within annual grassland on sandy tosandy-loam soils, the species historically grew atop the low hills northeastof Oildale southeasterly along the valley floor to the low foothills ofthe Tehachapi Mountains southeast and south-southwest of Arvin in KernCounty. Charles Preuss, John C. Fremont's cartographer, wrote of this areain 1844, that ``[t]he hilly country is bleak, without any vegetation excepta beautiful species of cactus whose magnificent red blossoms grace thissad, sandy desert in a strange manner.'' Ernest Twisselmann (1969) claimedthe species ``once grew in dense almost impenetrable colonies on the mesaseast of Bakersfield.'' A photograph in Britton and Rose (1920) atteststo the species' former abundance. As late as 1937, biologists noted thatthe species produced a ``thick growth'' along Caliente Creek (Piemeiseland Lawson 1937). However, ag-land conversion (primarily for the productionof potatoes and cotton), oil development, sand mining, urbanization, andperhaps wildfire have reduced this formerly widespread species to numerous,small isolated colonies. These colonies can be divided into five generalpopulation areas: the oilfields northeast of Oildale, Kern River Bluffsnortheast of Bakersfield, the bluffs and rolling hills west and north ofCaliente Creek east of Bakersfield, Comanche Point on the Tejon Ranch southeastof Arvin, and northwest of the community of Wheeler Ridge. Off-road vehicleuse, proposed flood control basins, and the activities cited above continueto threaten the remaining sites.Federal government actions on these five plants began as a result of section12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which directed the Secretaryof the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on those plants consideredto be endangered, threatened, or extinct. This report designated as HouseDocument No. 94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In thereport, <T3>Opuntia basilaris </T3>var.<T3> treleasei </T3>was listed as an endangered species. On July 1, 1975(40 FR 27823), the Service published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of its acceptance of the report as a petitionwithin the context of section 4(c)(2) [now section 4(b)(3)] of the Act,and of the Service's intention thereby to review the status of the planttaxa named within. <T3>Opuntia basilaris </T3>var. <T3>treleasei</T3> was included in that notice. On June 16, 1976, the Servicepublished a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700vascular plant species to be endangered species pursuant to section 4 ofthe Act. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of commentsand data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in responseto House Document No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication. <T3>Opuntia basilaris </T3>var. <T3>treleasei</T3> was included in the proposed rule. General commentsreceived in relation to the 1976 proposal were summarized in an April 26,1978, <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication, which also determined 13 plant speciesto be endangered or threatened (43 FR 178909). On December 10, 1979, theService published a notice of withdrawal of that portion of the June 16,1976, proposal that had expired due to a procedural requirement of the1978 Amendments. On December 15, 1980, the Service published a revisednotice of review of native plants in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 82480); <T3>Opuntia basilaris </T3>var. <T3>treleasei</T3> was included as a category 1 candidate species (speciesfor which data in the Service's possession indicate listing is warranted).On November 28, 1983, the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (48 FR 53640) a supplement to the 1980 noticeof review. This supplement added <T3>Caulanthus californicus </T3>as a category 2 candidate species (speciesfor which data in the Service's possession indicate listing is probablyappropriate, but for which additional biological information is neededto support a proposed rule). Along with <T3>Opuntia basilaris </T3>var. <T3>treleasei</T3> in category 1, <T3>Eremalche kernensis </T3>and <T3>Eriastrum hooveri </T3>were included with <T3>Caulanthus californicus </T3>in category 2 in the September 27, 1985,revised notice of review for plants (50 FR 39526). This proposal to list<T3>Caulanthus californicus, Eremalche kernensis, Lembertia congdonii,</T3>and <T3>Opuntia treleasei </T3>as endangered and <T3>Eriastrum hooveri</T3> as threatened largely is based on status surveysconducted by Taylor and Davilla (1986) and Taylor (1987), field work carriedout by Chamberlain (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 1986) and Mike Foster(botanist, California Energy Commission, pers. comm., November 24, 1987,January 22, 1988), and pertinent literature (see ``References Cited'' below).Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended in 1982, requiresthe Secretary to make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 monthsof their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requiresthat all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having beennewly submitted on that date. This was the case for one of the southernSan Joaquin Valley plants, <T3>Opuntia treleasei,</T3> because the 1975 Smithsonian report was acceptedas a petition. In October 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988, the Servicefound that the petitioned listing of <T3>Opuntia treleasei</T3> was warranted, but that the listing of thisspecies was precluded due to other higher priority listing actions. Publicationof the present proposal constitutes the next 1-year finding required byOctober 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations promulgated to implement the listingprovisions of the Act (50 CFR Part 424) set forth the procedures for addingspecies to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangeredor threatened species due to one or more of the five factors describedin section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Caulanthus californicus</T3> (Watson) Payson (California jewelflower);<T3>Eremalche kernenis</T3> C.B. Wolf (Kern mallow); <T3>Eriastrum hooveri</T3> (Jepson) H.L. Mason (Hoover's wooly-star); <T3>Lembertia congdonii</T3> (Gray) Greene (=<T3>Eatonella congdonii </T3>Gray) (San Joaquin wooly-threads); and <T3>Opuntia treleasei </T3>Coulter [=<T3>Opuntia basilaris </T3>Engelmann andamp; Bigelow var. <T3>treleasei </T3>(Coulter) Toumey] (Bakersfield cactus) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>All five species proposed herein (<T3>Caulanthus californicus</T3>, <T3>Eremalche kernensis</T3>, <T3>Eriastrum hooveri</T3>, <T3>Lembertia congdonii</T3>, and <T3>Opuntia treleasei</T3>) are restricted to grassland and adjacent plantcommunities (valley sink scrub, valley saltbush scrub, and juniper woodland)in the southern San Joaquin Valley and neighboring foothills and valleysin California (see ``Background'' section for specific distributions).The primary threat facing these five species is the ongoing and threateneddestruction and adverse modification of habitat. As discussed in the ``Background''section, primarily ag-land conversion and urbanization have claimed 96percent of the native habitats of the valley floor. The remaining non-urbanizedor non-converted lands, which largely occur in the neighboring foothillsand valleys (i.e., Carrizo Plain, Cuyama Valley), have been subject tolivestock grazing, water development, oil and gas development and exploration,off-road vehicle use, mining, and/or other activities. These anthropogenicactions continue to threaten the native plant communities and habitatsof these five species.<T3>Caulanthus californicus</T3> was known from 40 sites in six counties(Fresno, Kern, Kings, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Tulare), accordingto herbarium and field records detailed in the status survey by Taylorand Davilla (1986). Although once described as ``abundant on the plainsof the San Joaquin from Tulare southward (Greene 1891),'' the species isknown today from three sites: Two natural populations on private land (onenear the mouth of Santa Barbara Canyon in Santa Barbara County and anotherin the southern portion of Carrizo Plain in San Luis Obispo County) andone introduced colony in Paul Paine Preserve (owned by The Nature Conservancy)in Kern County. Although the landowners of the Santa Barbara Canyon populationhave entered into voluntary agreements with The Nature Conservancy to protectthe site (California Nature Conservancy 1987), no such agreement or protectionexists for the recently-discovered population in San Luis Obispo County.Though no plants were observed at Santa Barbara Canyon in 1987 (Taylor,pers. comm., February 21, 1987), several thousand plants were counted inthe spring of 1988. The Carrizo Plain population harbored a couple thousandindividuals in 1988 (Mike Foster, pers. comm., March 14, 1988). Taylornoted only 24 plants at the introduced site, of which only four plantsflowered. Rainfall patterns probably account for the variation in populationsize for these colonies of <T3>C. californicus</T3>. Ag-land conversion likely claimed most of thevalley floor sites due to the species' preference for sandy soils, whichare prized for viticulture (Taylor and Davilla 1986). As suggested fromherbarium records and the species' palatability, livestock grazing probablyclaimed the remaining extirpated sites within the last few decades (seeFactor ``D'' for discussion). In addition, Taylor and Davilla (1986) speculatethat poor air quality may have contributed to the demise of the speciesby promoting the growth of competing, pollution-tolerant plants (i.e.,<T3>Bromus rubens</T3>).<T3>Eremalche kernensis</T3> was known from six sites in western Kern County,according to herbarium and field records detailed in the status surveyby Taylor and Davilla (1986). Oil and gas development likely extirpatedthe type locality of the species in the Temblor Valley. Another site of<T3>E. kernensis,</T3> 5 miles north of Lost Hills, was probably eliminatedby ag-land conversion. In addition, construction of the California Aqueductmay have eliminated some unknown populations of the species. Three of theremaining four known occurrences exist on private land less than 5 milesfrom the South Belridge and Cymric Oil Fields and in the vicinity of transmissioncorridors (Taylor and Davilla 1986). Aside from maintenance or expansionof these corridors, future oil and gas development and exploration maythreaten these remaining sites. One population north of McKittrick occurson public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (Bureau). Thoughthe agency has not undertaken any special management of the site, the Bureaugives limited management consideration to candidate species. Nonetheless,this site still may be used for a variety of public uses (e.g., mineralextraction, oil and gas development, livestock grazing). All populationsoccur in areas grazed by sheep in the winter and spring. Consequently,Taylor and Davilla (1986) concluded, ``[u]ncontrolled and heavy sheep grazingwould be detrimental to <T3>E. kernensis</T3>.''<T3>Lembertia congdonii</T3> was known from 52 sites in seven counties(Fresno, Kern, Kings, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Tulare),according to herbarium and field records, and a recent status survey (Taylor1987; Foster, pers. comm., March 14, 1988). Habitat alteration, principallydue to ag-land conversion, eliminated 33 of these sites, including thetype locality and only known population in Tulare County. Of the remaining19 sites, Taylor (1987) observed the species growing at six of these localitiesin either 1986 or 1987, while Foster (pers. comm., March 14, 1988) foundan additional three populations in 1988. Population size ranged from 20to 300 plants, the largest stand scattered over approximately 100 acres.Although no plants were located at the other 10 localities, Taylor (1987)reported that these sites still have suitable habitat. Although three ofthe 19 sites presumably harboring <T3>L. congdonii </T3>are on public land managed by the Bureau of LandManagement, the agency has not undertaken any special management of theselocalities. Although the Bureau gives limited management considerationto candidate species, these sites still may be used for a variety of publicuses (e.g., mineral extraction, oil and gas development, livestock grazing).Another population presumably still persists at Sand Ridge east of Bakersfield.Although The Nature Conservancy owns a 120-acre parcel on Sand Ridge, thenorthern portion of this area remains in private ownership. Off-road vehicleuse, sand mining, and a flood control project proposed by the U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers pose a potential threat to resources within this area.Portions of two populations were acquired by The Nature Conservancy aspart of their Carrizo Plain Natural Heritage Preserve in early 1988. OnAugust 30, 1988, the California Department of Water Resources purchasedlands within the largely abandoned Strand and Canal Oil Fields, as partof the Kern Water Bank Project, that harbor the three populations foundby Foster. The remaining portions of three sites owned in part by The NatureConservancy and the other ten populations are privately owned and adjacentto lands that have been or continue to be urbanized, converted to agriculture,developed for oil and gas extraction and conveyance, or affected by off-roadvehicles and grazing livestock. Similar activities are likely to continuein the near future.<T3>Opuntia treleasei </T3>``once grew in dense almost impenetrable colonieson the mesas east of Bakersfield,'' according to Twisselman (1969). However,ag-land conversion (primarily for the production of potatoes and cotton),oil development, sand mining, urbanization, and perhaps wildfire have reducedthis formerly widespread species to numerous, small isolated colonies.As discussed in the ``Background'' section, these colonies can be dividedinto five general population areas. Primarily oil and gas development threatenthe colonies northeast of Oildale, the northernmost population. Thoughthis activity, to some degree, affects the population along the Kern RiverBluffs northeast and east of Bakersfield, this area is rapidly being convertedto housing for the ever-expanding population of Bakersfield. The constructionof a small hydroelectric project and its associated accidental wildfireaffected a few plants within the Kern River floodplain northeast of Bakersfieldand east of Lake Ming. Off-road vehicle use, sand mining, and perhaps livestockovergrazing threaten the colonies on the bluffs and rolling hills westand north of Caliente Creek, the population located within the center ofthe species' range. Because the cactus provides no forage for livestockand competes with the alien grasses, ranchers may undertake eradicationprograms which may adversely affect the species. As discussed under <T3>Lembertia congdonii,</T3> The Nature Conservancy owns a portion ofthe Sand Ridge colony along the bluffs of Caliente Creek. However, a proposedflood control project likely will eliminate some individuals in the SandRidge area, including many plants on property owned by The Nature Conservancy.The Tejon Ranch, which is aware of the solitary clump of <T3>O. Treleasei</T3> on the ranch, has not expressed any plans to eliminatethe cactus at Comanche Point. This population, however, is less than 4miles from the Comanche Point Oil Field, which suggests the site may besubject to future oil and gas exploration. Ag-land conversion, aqueductand transmission line maintenance, off-road vehicle use, urbanization,road widening, and illegal dumping threaten the remaining isolated coloniesnorthwest of the community of Wheeler Ridge (Foster, pers. comm., January,22, 1988), although one population grows on land owned by the State ofCalifornia and administered by the California Department of Water Resources.In addition, the North Tejon Oil Field affects much of the Wheeler Ridgearea.<T3>Eriastrum hooveri </T3>was known from 49 sites in four counties (Fresno,Kern, San Luis Obispo, and Santa Barbara), according to individual reports(Taylor, pers. comm., November 30, 1987; Foster, pers. comm., November24, 1987) and a recent status survey (Taylor and Davilla 1986). Primarilyag-land conversion and urbanization eliminated eleven of these sites. Ofthe remaining 38 sites, one population occurs on the Paul Paine Preserve,which The Nature Conservancy owns and protects. Another five sites presumablystill exist either in the Temblor Range or Alcalde Hills, either or whichmay harbor additional populations. Overgrazing poses the only imminentthreat to these foothill populations. Although recent field survey workconducted by the California Department of Water Resources greatly expandedthe area known by Taylor and Davilla (1986) to harbor the species alongWarthan Creek in Fresno County (Arthur Gooch, pers. comm., July 22, 1988),this large population is threatened by the proposed Arroyo Pasajero Project.Cited as two populations in Taylor and Davilla (1986), the only populationsknown to occur on public land are from the Elk Hills on Naval PetroleumReserve No. 1 (NPR-1) managed by the Department of Energy and on an adjacentparcel managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Inasmuch as Taylor andDavilla (1986) were unable to thoroughly survey NPR-1, the Department ofEnergy's consultant conducted a survey in 1988. Preliminary results reportedfinding 28 ``populations'' primarily along the northern and southern boundariesof NPR-1 (Thomas Kato, EGandamp;G Energy Measurements, pers. comm., August2, 1988). Though neither the Department of Energy nor the Bureau has undertakenany special management of these localities, the latter agency gives limitedmanagement consideration to candidate species. However, this policy doesnot necessarily prevent this population site from being used for a varietyof public uses. Consequently, mineral extraction, oil and gas development,and livestock grazing may threaten these federally owned populations. Onepopulation, occurring on the Alkali Sink Ecological Preserve, grows onland owned by the State of California and managed by the California Departmentof Fish and Game. According to Taylor and Davilla (1986), the 29 remainingsites (including a portion of another population that occurs on both publicand private land) occur on private property and typically on small, irregularlyshaped parcels surrounded by ag-land and/or urban areas, which are oftenadjacent to roads. Seven of these sites harbor substantial populations(5,000 to 40,000 plants), while the remaining 23 sites consist of lessthan 1,000 individuals. All 29 populations occur on sites ranging fromapproximately an acre to less than 400 acres in size. Though many of theseprivately owned sites are perhaps too small to farm economically, parcelssuch as these continue to be converted to ag-land. Moreover, urbanization,conversion of habitat for ground-water recharge basins or disposal of nutrient-ladenagricultural effluent, off-road vehicle use, and oil and gas developmentcontinue to threaten these 29 populations (Taylor and Davilla 1986). B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>Although not necessarily applicable to these species, manycacti are collected and cultivated by plant collectors, or offered forsale or trade by cactus growers. Though no data exist demonstrating suchcommerce in <T3>Opuntia treleasei, </T3>the species may still be collected and cultivated.C. <T3>Disease or predation</T3>. As briefly mentioned above under Factor``A'', livestock grazing probably extirpated colonies of <T3>Caulanthus californicus</T3> growing in the foothills and valleys adjoiningthe southern San Joaquin Valley. Moreover, trampling by livestock may havecontributed to the endangerment of this species and <T3>Eremalche kernensis</T3>. Overgrazing may also threaten the other threespecies proposed herein.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms</T3>. Under the NativePlant Protection Act (Chapter 1.5 section 1900 <T3>et seq.</T3> of the Fish and Game Code) and California Endangered SpeciesAct (Chapter 1.5 section 2050 <T3>et seq</T3>.), the California Fish and Game Commission has listed oneof these five species (<T3>Caulanthus californicus</T3>) as endangered (14 California Code ofRegulations 670.2), while aother species (<T3>Opuntia treleasei)</T3> is a State candidate (Stephen Nicola, pers.comm., September 23, 1988). Though both statutes prohibit the ``take''of State-listed plants (Chapter 1.5 sections 1908 and 2080), Stat law appearsto exempt the taking of such plants via habitat modification or land usechange by the landowner. Afer the California Department of Fish and Gamenotifies a landowner that a State-listed plant grows on his or her property,State law evidently requires only that the landowner notify the agency``at least 10 days in advance of changing the land use to allow salvageof such plant.'' (Chapter 1.5 section 1913)<T3>Opuntia treleasei,</T3> like all Cactaceae from the Americas not listedseparately under Appendix I, is included under Appendix II of the Conventionon International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).Although CITES regulates the international trade of listed species, thepossibility of trade is not currently a threat to <T3>Opuntia treleasei.</T3>E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>The invasion of alien, annual grasses has adversely affected all of theremaining ``natural'' areas since the days of the Franciscan missionaries.These alien grasses, which account for 50 to 90 percent of the vegetativecover (Heady 1956) and can stand up to a meter in height (Holland 1986),largely dominate grasslands of California. As discussed in the ``Background''section, the exotic annuals may alter the natural fire regime and theseplants have either outcompeted or continue to compete with the native flora.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thesespecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Caulanthus californicus, Eremalche kernensis, Lembertia congdonii,</T3>and <T3>Opuntia treleasei </T3>as endangered, and to list <T3>Eriastrum hooveri</T3> as threatened.<T3>Caulanthus californicus, Eremalche kernensis, Lembertia congdonii,</T3>and <T3>Opuntia treleasei</T3> have been extirpated from all but a small fractionof their historical ranges. Today these species generally persist as small,isolated populations or colonies surrounded by ag-land, urban areas, oilfields, and/or roads. Competition from alien grasses probably has and continuesto adversely affect these species, especially the three annual herbs (<T3>Caulanthus californicus, Eremalche kernensis, </T3>and <T3>Lembertia congdonii</T3>). Although The Nature Conservancy owns mostof the three remaining populations of <T3>Caulanthus californicus</T3> (California Nature Conservancy 1987),stochastic events affecting such extremely small populations still mayresult in the extinction of this species. All four remaining populationsof <T3>Eremalche kernensis</T3> occur within a solitary township north ofMcKittrick, which may be adversely affected by livestock trampling, transmissioncorridor maintenance or expansion, and oil and gas development or exploration.The remaining 19 sites of <T3>Lembertia congdonii</T3> are variously threatened by ag-land conversion,urbanization, conversion of habitat for ground-water recharge basins, ordisposal of agricultural effluent, livestock overgrazing, off-road vehicleuse, and/or oil an gas development and exploration. Four populations oftwo of these species (<T3>Eremalche kernensis</T3> and <T3>Lembertia congdonii</T3>) occur on public land managed by the Bureauof Land Management, which accords limited management consideration to candidatespecies. However, this policy does not prevent the use of these sites fora variety of public uses (e.g., mineral extraction, oil and gas development,livestock grazing). The relictual colonies of <T3>Opuntia treleasei</T3> are imminently threatened by ag-land conversion,oil development, sand mining, urbanization, off-road vehicle use, constructionof flood control basins, aqueduct and transmission line maintenance, roadwidening, illegal dumping, and/or potentially alterations in the naturalfire regime. Because these four plants are in danger of extinction throughoutall or a significant portion of their ranges, they fit the definition ofendangered as defined in the Act.<T3>Eriastrum hooveri</T3> has been extirpated, principally as a resultof ag-land conversion and urbanization, from 11 of its 49 known sites.Of the remaining 38 sites, one population is in preserve status and fivesites presumably still exist either in the Temblor Range or the AlcaldeHills. Overgrazing poses the only imminent threat to these foothill populations.Two populations, for the most part, occur on public land, though the extentof the species of NPR-1 is under study. Regardless, these sites remainvulnerable to a variety of public uses (e.g., mineral extraction, oil andgas development, and livestock grazing). The 30 remaining parcels, includinga portion of another population that occurs on both public and privateland, are threatened by ag-land conversion, urbanization, conversion ofhabitat for ground-water recharge basins or disposal of agricultural effluent,off-road vehicle use, and oil and gas development and exploration (Taylorand Davilla 1986). Although the number of extant populations (38), includingthose located on NPR-1, provides greater flexibility in recovery and reducesthe likelihood that the species will go extinct in the immediate future,the threats facing the 31 sites of <T3>E. hooveri</T3> on private property, at least in part, suggest thatthe species is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeablefuture. Because of the limited threats facing the foothill populationsof <T3>E. hooveri</T3> and the likelihood additional occurrences may be foundin these upland areas, this species is not now in immediate danger of extinctionthroughout all or a significant portion of its range. However, if appropriatemanagement actions are not taken, the species is likely to become in dangerof extinction in the near future. As a result, <T3>E. hooveri</T3> fits the definition of threatened species as definedin the Act.Critical Habitat Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at thetime a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that determination of critical habitat is not prudent for these speciesat this time. Because the five species face numerous anthropogenic threats(see Factor A in ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'') and occurpredominantly on private land, the publication of precise maps and descriptionsof critical habitat in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> would make these plants more vulnerable to incidentsof vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to the decline of these species.The listing of these species as either endangered or threatened also publicizesthe rarity of these plants and, thus, can make these plants attractiveto researchers or collectors of rare plants. No Federal protection existspursuant to section 9 of the Act for such take of listed plants on non-Federallands. The proper agencies have been notified of the locations and managementneeds of these plants. Landowners will be notified of the location andimportance of protecting habitat of these species. Protection of thesespecies' habitats will be addressed through the recovery process and throughthe section 7 jeopardy standard. The Service believes that Federal involvementin the areas where these plants occur can be identified without the designationof critical habitat. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat for these plants is not prudent at this time, because such designationlikely would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting,or other human activities. Available Conservation Measures Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingare discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service. Seven populationsof three of the proposed plant species occur on Federal (public) land;one population of <T3>Eremalche kernensis</T3> is managed by the Bureau of Land Management,two populations of <T3>Eriastrum hooveri</T3> are administered respectively by the Bureauof Land Management and Department of Energy, and four populations of <T3>Lembertia congdonii</T3> are managed by the Bureau of Land Management.Though some other stands occur near Federal land, all of the remainingknown sites are on private land with no known Federal involvement withthe following exceptions. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureauof Reclamation may fund or develop, at least in part, proposed flood controlor water projects. Because of potential impacts to two federally listedanimals, the San Joaquin kit fox (<T3>Vulpes macrotis mutica</T3>) and the bluntnosed leopard lizard (<T3>Gambelia silus</T3>), the Corps has consulted formally on a proposedflood control project for Caliente Creek. This project would potentiallyeliminate numerous individual plants of <T3>Opuntia treleasei</T3> from the Sand Ridge colony, which grows on thebluffs adjoining the creek (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 1986). Aside fromthe direct effects of this and other similar proposed projects, other potentialFederal actions include new allocations of water from existing Federalprojects, which could increase ag-land conversion and possibly affect oneor more of these five plant species. Activities involving Federal mortgageprograms, including those of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (FarmersHome Administration), Veterans Administration, and U.S. Department of Housingand Urban Development (Federal Home Administration loans), may be subjectto section 7 review. The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 for endangered species and 17.71 and 17.72 for threatened speciesset forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptions that applyto all endangered and threatened plant species. With respect to the fiveplants from the southern San Joaquin Valley, all trade prohibitions ofsection 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61 and 17.71, wouldapply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export, transportin interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity,sell or offer for sale these species in interstate or foreign commerce,or to remove and reduce to possession these species from areas under Federaljurisdiction. Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant speciesare exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statement of ``cultivatedorigin'' appears on their containers. Certain exceptions can apply to agentsof the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62,17.63, and 17.72 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry outotherwise prohibited activities involving endangered and threatened plantspecies under certain circumstances. The Service anticipates few tradepermits would ever be sought or issued for the five species, with the possibleexception of <T3>Opuntia treleasei</T3> which, like other cacti, may be in cultivation.Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regardingthem may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240 (703/343-4955).As a species of Cactaceae (Cactus family), <T3>Opuntia treleasei</T3> is included in Appendix II of the CITES Convention(See 50 CFR 23.23). The effect of this protection under the CITES Conventionis that an export permit must be issued by the country of origin, or are-export certificate must be issued by the country of re-export priorto the importation of <T3>Opuntia treleasei.</T3> Such CITES Convention restrictions are intendedto prevent international trade from being detrimental to the survival ofthe species.Public Comments SolicitedThe Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to <T3>Caulanthus californicus, Eremalche kernensis, Eriastrum hooveri, Lembertiacongdonii,</T3> or <T3>Opuntia treleasei</T3>;(2) The location of any additional populations of these species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thesespecies; and(4) Current or planned activities in the ranges and habitats of these speciesand their possible impacts on these species.Final promulgation of the regulations on these species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to adoption of final regulations that differfrom this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to FieldSupervisor (see <T2>ADDRESS </T2>section).National Environmental Policy ActThe Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not beprepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to Section 4(a)of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining theService's reasons for this determination was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).References Cited<ITAG tagnum="25">Abrams, L., and R.S.
