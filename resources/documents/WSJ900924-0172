The action raises the curtain on a week when attentionwill focus on Neil Bush's actions as an outside director ofSilverado Banking, Savings andamp; Loan Association, which failedin December 1988 at an expected cost to taxpayers of $1billion. In a separate administrative action that regulatorsare pursuing against Mr. Bush, public testimony beginstomorrow and is expected to last through the week.</LP><TEXT>   The crisis in the Middle East has given the Republicans arespite from growing public anger about the Sandamp;L fiasco andcriticism that the Bush administration was bungling themassive bailout.   There's some irony in the status Neil Bush has attained asa kind of minor folk villain -- hundreds of posters reading&quot;Jail Neil Bush&quot; have been pasted around downtown Washingtonand Denver, where Mr. Bush lives. (It's unclear who put theposters up.) Mr. Bush hasn't even been accused of anycriminal activity, much less found guilty of any improperbehavior. In addition, while regulators have asserted in theadministrative case that Mr. Bush didn't adequately discloseconflicts of interest with Silverado borrowers, no one hassuggested he profited significantly from the thrift.   Nevertheless, the suit filed Friday in federal court inDenver by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. addstremendously to Mr. Bush's legal woes. The suit goes farbeyond the administrative action in seeking to hold Mr. Bushand 11 other former officials of the Denver thrift broadlyresponsible for alleged violations of federal regulations.The FDIC has filed more than 200 such suits against directorsin Sandamp;L failures, but this is one of the largest damage awardsthe agency has sought.   &quot;Silverado was the victim of sophisticated schemes andabuses by insiders and of gross negligence by its directorsand outside professionals,&quot; said Douglas Jones, the FDIC'ssenior deputy general counsel.   The FDIC charged that Silverado routinely shoveled outrisky multimillion-dollar real estate loans so that thethrift could book big fees and pass on huge salaries to someof its officers. In 1986 alone, the suit alleged, four topofficials -- excluding Mr. Bush -- were paid $3.2 million.   Mr. Bush has fought the administrative action brought bythe Office of Thrift Supervision, which is seeking a mildpunishment in which Mr. Bush would agree not to violatefederal regulations in the future. But it will probably betougher and more expensive to defend himself against the FDICsuit, banking lawyers said, because the FDIC appears to havea strong case.   A key point alleged by the FDIC is that Mr. Bush and theother outside directors failed to &quot;correct unsafe and unsoundpractices at Silverado after receiving numerous criticisms ofsuch practices&quot; from regulators. Mr. Bush, who is in the oilbusiness, was an outside director of Silverado from August1985 until August 1988.   &quot;This case will turn on what the examiners told Silveradoand when they told them,&quot; said Ronald Glancz, an attorneywith Drinker Biddle andamp; Reath and a former FDIC official whohandled such lawsuits. &quot;In the case of directors, you've gotto show some sort of notice. It's tough to convince a jurythat directors knew some practices were imprudent if theregulators didn't give them any warning.&quot;   Mr. Glancz said that about 90% of defendants in the FDIC'ssuits against directors and officers settle the cases. Oftenthe banks and thrifts have insurance to cover the liability.But Silverado's insurance was canceled in 1986. The thriftset up a fund of about $15 million to help directors andofficers pay legal fees, but the FDIC is engaged in aseparate legal battle to get the $15 million back.   Neither Mr. Bush nor his attorney returned phone callsseeking comment.</TEXT></DOC>
