The key component of the prototype dosimeter systemis a newly developed radiation sensitive storage phosphor. When thisphosphor is excited by energetic radiation, a proportionate populationof electron-hole pairs are created which become trapped at specific impuritieswithin the phosphor. Trapped electrons can subsequently be stimulatedoptically with near-infrared at approximately 1 micrometer wavelength;the electrons can recombine with holes at luminescent centers to producea luminescence which is directly proportional to the trapped electronpopulation, and thus to the radiation exposure. By attaching the phosphorto the end of an optical fiber, it is possible to transmit both the IRoptical stimulation and the characteristic phosphor luminescence throughthe fiber to and from the read-out instrument, which can be located far(e.g., kilometers) from the radiation field. This document reports onthe specific design of the prototype system and its operating characteristics,including its sensitivity to various radiation dose rates and energies,its dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio at various radiation intensities,and other system characteristics. Additionally, the radiation hardnessof the phosphor and fiber are evaluated. 17 refs., 29 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
