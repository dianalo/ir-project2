In Part I some simple subsidence mechanisms are introduced.Part II will concentrate on actual subsidence behaviour and relate thisto the subsidence mechanisms. In Part III principles of mine design forboth controlling surface subsidence and ensuring local and regional stabilityof workings are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
