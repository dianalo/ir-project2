Police estimated the crowd at about 20,000, but organizers ofthe ``March for Women's Lives'' said more than 30,000 peopleparticipated in the march and rally at City Hall.   Margaret Connell, 59, of Santa Barbara, marched with her85-year-old mother and 30-year-old daughter. They carried a signthat said ``Three generations for choice.''   ``I think what's before us is a choice of whether abortion issafe and legal or whether abortion is unsafe and illegal,'' saidConnell. ``It's not whether there's going to be abortion.''   The march, which was expected to attract supporters from as faraway as Oregon and Washington state, was held in conjunction with ascheduled April 9 abortion rights rally in Washington, D.C.   In New York City, about 400 abortion rights activists, somehoisting giant clothes hangers, pushed against anti-abortionists ina demonstration in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral.   In a rare show of civil disobedience marking what a rally leadercalled ``a turning point'' in the abortion rights movement, nineactivists were arrested for trespassing on church property anddisorderly conduct.   ``Cardinal O'Connor, we know your position, you are the head ofthe new Inquisition!'' shouted the protesters, who say thatCardinal John O'Connor and the Roman Catholic hierarchy areendorsing violence against women by supporting radicalanti-abortionists.   Neither O'Connor nor his spokesman returned messages seekingcomment on the protest.   Activists on both sides of the issue have been galvanized by arecent U.S. Supreme Court decision to hear a case that couldoverturn legal protections for abortion that were guaranteed by thecourt's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.   Many participants said that threat prompted them to gather inthe streets to publicly express their views.   ``It's the timing with the court,'' said Ann Murphy, 43, ofBerkeley. ``Our position doesn't mean we're telling people to havean abortion, because there's nothing worse than a child that'sunloved and unwanted. ... It's a matter of respecting opinions.''   The rally also comes at a time when several anti-abortiongroups, including Operation Rescue, have held numerous protests atclinics around the nation.   In Miami, a suburban abortion clinic was blockaded for more thanan hour Saturday by anti-abortion demonstrators. Police arrested137 people on trespassing charges.   On Friday, 83 people were arrested for blocking access to anabortion clinic in Boca Raton, Fla., and an arson fire early Fridaycaused $65,000 damage to an abortion clinic in Ocala, Fla.   Sunday's San Francisco march brought a sharp reaction fromanti-abortion activists.   ``Although the marchers purport to represent the women ofAmerica, I think they are deluded by their own sense ofself-importance,'' Carole Hieatt of San Jose Pro-Life Council saidin a statement.   In its most recent poll on the subject, the Los Angeles Timesreported on March 19 that 74 percent of the respondents in anationwide survey said they believed that abortion was ``morallywrong,'' but also believed that it was a decision best left to theindividual.   More than 100 organizations sponsored Sunday's demonstration,including NOW, Planned Parenthood Association, the CaliforniaAbortion Rights Action League and the American Civil LibertiesUnion.</TEXT></DOC>
