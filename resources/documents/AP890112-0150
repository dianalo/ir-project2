Bush was asked if he planned any action to put the brakes on theincreasing number of takeovers, many through so-called leveragedbuyouts.   ``You are talking to one who would as much as possible rely onmarket forces,'' Bush replied.   In a leveraged buyout, an investment group borrows heavily to buyout stockholders and take over the target company. Sometimes suchbuyouts are proposed by managers seeking to thwart a hostiletakeover.   The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces ofthe company to pay back loans. Critics of the practice fear thathigh debt levels, particularly in a recession, could endanger boththe bought-out company and the financiers of the transaction.   Bush said that ``if there are abuses of our tax laws, ... thewhole tax law will be reviewed to see how they can be eliminated.''   The vice president did not elaborate, but hinted that hisadministration might examine changes in tax laws to make clearer thedistinction between debt and equity.</TEXT></DOC>
