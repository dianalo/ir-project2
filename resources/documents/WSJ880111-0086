A long-term auto-industry development plan, released by the ministry, calls for boosting annual production of commercial vehicles to two million units by the year 2000, six times current capacity. The plan predicts that annual commercial-vehicle exports will rise from 10,000 units last year to 100,000 units by 1991, 300,000 units by 1996 and 900,000 units by the year 2000.    Officials said prospects for commercial vehicles are becoming brighter as Japanese makers' competitiveness is eroded, largely because of the strong yen. They said car exports, currently stressed by Korean auto makers, may slow in the future because of growing international competition plus the likelihood of increased protectionism in advanced countries.    The officials said commercial-vehicle demand is likely to rise in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
