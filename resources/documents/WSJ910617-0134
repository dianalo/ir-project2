Who else could the BIS have had in mind but the manwho -- until recently -- was jawboning the Federal Reserveand other central banks to open the money spigots?   The barbs were tossed at the 61st annual general meetingof the BIS in Basel. BIS Chairman and President Bengt Denniscommented that the current situation, with U.S. short-termrates two to three percentage points below those of Germanyand Japan, is &quot;truly remarkable.&quot; That mild observation spokeloudly in the context of the war Mr. Brady and his Treasurycolleagues not long ago were waging against central banks.Driving home the implied criticism, Mr. Dennis warned that&quot;we should not risk compromising the credibility of ourpolicies by permitting any revival of inflation.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Dennis, who also runs Sweden's central bank, was ofcourse indulging in good old-fashioned central-banker talk.The BIS is Europe's center for central-bank policycoordination and rule-making. It sometimes is called thecentral bank for central bankers. Few in the chairman'saudience would have quarreled with his assertion that zeroinflation &quot;remains the ultimate yardstick against which ourmonetary policies should be judged.&quot;   Nor would I. When central bankers do their jobs well --which often means resisting powerful political pressures ofthe type Mr. Brady was trying to apply -- a lot of bad thingsdon't happen. Impoverished widows don't faint in supermarketaisles at the sight of escalating price tags on hamburger andpet food. Business managers don't have to watch their capitalmelt away. Markets are not distorted. Money flows into sound,productive long-term investments, creating solid new jobs.   Happily, Europe's money men of today are mostly a seriouslot. Most currencies are fixed, officially or unofficially,to the German mark. British Prime Minister John Major hasstaked his political future on killing inflation. A mood ofuprightness and decorum reigns even in the central banks ofFrance and Spain.   But if Mr. Dennis was chiding the U.S. for being out ofstep with this virtuous renaissance, there is one seeminginconsistency. Even though U.S. short-term interest rates areartificially low, the U.S. dollar has strengthenedsignificantly. U.S. stocks, with the Dow bouncing around the3000 level, are well above first-of-the-year levels. How canthis be true, when one would assume that the low U.S.short-term rates would be driving people away from dollars?   One answer is easy. Mr. Brady could jawbone short ratesdown, but not the all-important long-term rates. The U.S.30-year Treasury bond is yielding some 8.5%, not far out ofline with German 10-year bonds. The market makes its owndecisions about long rates, and what the market is sayingmore nearly comports with European than U.S. policy.   Another answer is at least plausible: Mr. Brady reportedlyhas received instructions from on high, that is the OvalOffice, to tone down his campaign against the central banks.   But while all this could explain a stable dollar-exchangerate, it doesn't explain a strong dollar. If U.S. policy isso bad, why has U.S. inflation moderated, for example? Oneanswer is that the U.S. has been in a recession, but for awhile the Consumer Price Index went up even during theslowdown -- stagflation, in other words.   To probe further, I called economist John Mueller, ofLehrman Bell Mueller Cannon Inc., an Arlington, Va.,economics house. Using something called the &quot;world dollarbase&quot; as one of their primary forecasting tools, Mr. Muellerand his colleagues have racked up an excellent forecastingrecord lately. They called the 1990 recession and thebeginnings of the current recovery. The world dollar basetakes account of dollars in the reserves of foreign centralbanks as well as those normally counted in the U.S. monetarybase, on the assumption that the world monetary system is farmore integrated than is normally assumed.   Quite possibly, Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon has the answerto the dollar's strength. If so, it is a fairly simple one.LBMC is predicting a stronger U.S. recovery than most U.S.economists see, a GNP growth rate peaking out at about 5% inthe third quarter this year. Europe and Japan, with businesscycles currently out of phase with the U.S., may still havesome wringing out to do.   Mr. Mueller thinks the recovery will be relativelyinflation-free for some months. During recoveries,productivity normally rises. It will take some time fordemand to fuel commodity-price rises.   But don't get the idea Mr. Mueller has joined the Bradybunch. He is not in favor of further interest-rate jawboning.This March he wrote an article for these pages saying thathis world dollar base showed that the Fed already had pumpedmore liquidity into the economy than most people imagined. Hecautioned against further credit easing on the grounds thatit could bring a resumption of stagflation.   So the BIS and LBMC are not so far apart, after all.Recovery is one thing, but getting the U.S. back on a path ofsustained growth is quite something else. A recovery can takeplace through the normal workings of a business cycle.Sustained growth requires sound policies.   Mr. Dennis, taking a rather traditional European view,wondered how long it is likely to be before last year'sbudgetary compromise between George Bush and Congress willmake some impact on the U.S. federal deficit. It could benever. Congress has just voted itself another huge deficit,$278 billion, for fiscal 1992. Some people, including Mr.Dennis, think that the world's credit markets already areoverburdened, what with Japan generating smaller surplusesand big demands for credit coming in from Germany and theSoviet Union on top of the chronic demands of the U.S.Congress.   Aside from U.S. fiscal policies, there is good reason todoubt whether the banking reform that Congress is currentlyshredding will be a reform or a bill that makes mattersworse. Certainly the fundamental problem of the U.S. bankingsystem, openended federal deposit guarantees that encourageirresponsible banking, is not being addressed. A recovery canhappen naturally but restoring growth is a matter ofimproving the economic structure with intelligentlegislation, and the U.S. doesn't appear to be achievingthat.   So maybe Mr. Dennis and his European colleagues have apoint, even if the current outlook for both inflation andrecovery in the U.S. is good and the dollar and the Dow arestrong. As Mr. Dennis said in his talks, in effect, centralbankers can't do the entire job. Truer words were neverspoken.</TEXT></DOC>
