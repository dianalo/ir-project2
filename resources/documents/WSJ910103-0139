In his cave-like office here beneath the Dome of the Rockmosque -- a stone's throw from where Abraham nearlysacrificed Isaac and the prophet Mohammed ascended to heavenon a staircase of light -- the deputy mufti of Jerusalemholds forth on history.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Our problem isn't a Palestinian problem. It's an Islamicproblem,&quot; says the bearded cleric, whom Israeli officialshave accused of inciting the October riot in which policekilled 18 Palestinians at the Dome of the Rock. &quot;Islam hasdestroyed Western invaders in this land before. Allah knows,we can do it again.&quot;   Israel knows, too, that the intifada, or Palestinianuprising, has recently added a new and dangerous dimension:Islamic holy war.   Fueled partly by the October massacre but more by Arabdespair over three years of civil unrest with nothing to showfor it, Moslem fundamentalism is on the rise in theIsraeli-occupied territories. Islamic groups, long treatedwith benign neglect by Israeli authorities hoping toundermine the largely secular Palestine LiberationOrganization, now dominate the political and socialinstitutions of the teeming Gaza Strip, and rival the PLO'sinfluence on the West Bank as well.   To the Islamic extremists, unlike their nationalistcounterparts in the PLO, the enemy isn't so much Israel; it'sthe Jews.   &quot;The Day of Judgment won't come to pass until the Moslemswage war against the Jews and destroy them,&quot; says thecovenant of Hamas, or &quot;zeal&quot; in Arabic, largest of thefundamentalist groups. &quot;And even if the Jew hides behind arock and a tree, the rock and the tree will say: Moslem,God-fearing man, there is a Jew behind me, come and killhim.&quot;   Religious fanaticism -- prevalent among Jews, too -- isfanning flames of militancy on both sides of the intifada,dimming already bleak hopes of an Israeli-Palestinian accord.Since the Dome of the Rock killings, Hamas leaflets andgraffiti have beseeched Palestinians to escalate the intifadaby slaying Jewish civilians inside the so-called Green Lineof Israel proper. The entreaties, a marked departure from therestraint that helped endear the Palestinian cause to theworld during the intifada's first three years, have beenfollowed by a rash of knifings of Jews inside Israel. In thepast 10 weeks, an average of one Jew a week has been killedin intifada violence, a three-fold increase in the rate ofJewish deaths over the previous 150 weeks of the uprising.Three people were stabbed to death in a factory near Tel Avivlast month. Near their bodies, the murderers scrawled Islamicslogans on the blood-spattered walls, and signed thegraffiti, &quot;Hamas.&quot;   The rising bloodshed has forced Israel to clamp down evenharder on Arabs under its control, and to rethink theoccupation itself. Since conquering the territories in 1967,Israel has made almost no effort to develop the Palestinianeconomy, allowing, instead, more than 100,000 Arabs to workat mostly menial jobs inside bustling Israel. But as the fearof jihad, or holy war, has spread in recent weeks, Jewishemployers have started firing Arab workers by the hundreds,and the government, worried that the Palestinian economycould collapse, has been forced to look into ways ofdeveloping jobs in the occupied lands.   Israeli authorities have also cracked down on Hamas, afterspending years helping establish its parent group, theIslamic Brotherhood, as a rival to the PLO. In the past sixweeks, the military has detained more than 500 alleged Hamasactivists, and begun deportation proceedings against fourreputed leaders. The government has held the group's founder,a paraplegic named Sheik Ahmed Yassin, for 19 months pendingtrial.   The military crackdown is unlikely to slow the spread ofMoslem fundamentalism or divert its aim: an Islamic state, inthe words of Hamas, &quot;from the {Jordan} River to the{Mediterranean} Sea.&quot; That's because, in the eyes of many ofthe stone-throwing shabab, or youth, who wage the intifada,the tactics of moderation have been a failure. Jihad, atleast, promises to make the enemy suffer, too, and beckonswould-be martyrs with a special place in paradise.   &quot;The world has lost interest in our problem,&quot; says a30-year-old West Bank man, who spent one and a half years inprison for helping organize shabab. &quot;It's time to fight withweapons, to see them die like we die.&quot;   Nationalist and religious groups have long sparred overtactics and leadership in the occupied territories, but theintifada has brought the rivalry to a crucial point. Thisfall, nearly 100 Arabs were wounded in fighting between PLOand Hamas partisans in the Tulkarm refugee camp, before apeace pact restored order.   In the twisting alleys and narrow stairwells of Hebron,south of Jerusalem, the writing is literally on the wall. Awar of graffiti has broken out on nearly every building inthe city. Hamas's calls for holy war vie for space on thewalls with the nationalist scribblings of Fatah, themainstream PLO group led by Yasser Arafat. In one Hamasdrawing, a clenched fist bursts through the Dome of the Rock,capping the slogan: &quot;Hamas is stronger than bullets.&quot; Andthough most of Fatah's graffiti uses secular images likePalestinian maps and flags, the PLO group, too, now puts morereligious content in its slogans, say Paul Steinberg and AnneMarie Oliver, who have been compiling a computer data bank ofArab graffiti since the start of the intifada.   &quot;The religious language legitimizes violence in a way thatthe jargon of nationalism can't,&quot; Ms. Oliver says.   In a crowded barber shop in downtown Hebron, away from thewatchful eye of Israeli troops looming everywhere in thecity, tempers flare over the question of what gives thePalestinian struggle its true inspiration. The shop's owner,who says he spent 14 years in an Israeli prison for being inthe PLO, insists the fight is about land, not God. &quot;Jewslived under Moslem rule for 1,400 years without anyproblems,&quot; he says.   But his customers take angry exception. &quot;The war has beenbuilding since the Jews tried to kill the Prophet Mohammed,&quot;says a man in a grey suit, who identifies himself as afarmer. Adds another customer, an English teacher namedBashir: &quot;The Jews have their Torah that tells them to come inthis land. We have to fight them with our Holy Koran.&quot;   More important, though, are the views of the shabab, thesoldiers of the intifada who gather several times a week inthe sloping neighborhoods above central Hebron and launchhailstorms of rocks on Israeli cars and troops below. Theritual offensive is met with tear gas and rubber bullets, andoccasionally gunfire. To seal the rock-throwers' escaperoutes, the military has bulldozed several walls and builtbarricades between certain homes, but the shabab suffer noshortage of refuge in the maze of Arab dwellings.   One shabab leader, an 18-year-old who gives his name asJihad, says young Palestinians are rapidly losing faith inthe PLO's ability to deliver an independent state throughnegotiations. It isn't religion that draws youths to Moslemgroups like Hamas, says this boy, who served 10 months inprison. It's extremism.   &quot;We're tired; we want a solution,&quot; he says. &quot;Where itcomes from isn't important.&quot;   Without progress on the political front, Israelis andPalestinians alike say the growing popularity of groups likeHamas is certain to push nationalists, as well, towardradical solutions. Mr. Arafat, in his New Year's address tothe people of the territories this week, stopped short ofcalling for the use of arms in the intifada. But Feisalal-Husseini, the ranking Palestinian leader in EastJerusalem, says if people become convinced that &quot;we're livingin the jungle where force is the only means of persuasion,&quot;the PLO will have to respond to its constituency.   Jonathan Kuttab, a Palestinian lawyer and a Christian,says he knows many Arab moderates who now subscribe to whathe calls the &quot;Lebanon argument&quot;: that Israel will withdrawfrom the territories only after it pays an unacceptable pricein blood.   &quot;The battle over tactics isn't just Hamas vs. the PLO,&quot;says Mr. Kuttab. &quot;It's inside the moderate camp, insideFatah, even inside me, a lifelong pacifist. I feel the forcesof nonviolence and moderation retreating, and the argumentsfor extremism on the rise.&quot;   ---                 Three Years of Intifada                                                                                                        Percentage drop in hours worked by Palestinians: 1988-1989 vs.                      11.5% 1986-1987                                                                                                        Palestinian Casualties                                                                                                        Wounded                                            13,017 Killed by Israelis                                    628 Killed by Palestinians                                368                                                                                                        Israeli Casualties                                                                                                        Soldiers wounded                                     2,880 Soldiers killed                                         10 Civilians wounded                                    1,189 Civilians killed                                        12                                                                                                        Palestinians held in administrative                  1,076 detention without charges                                                                                                        Palestinians in prison for                           9,840 intifada crimes                                                                                                        Source: Israel Central Bureau of Statistics and IsraelDefense Force</TEXT></DOC>
