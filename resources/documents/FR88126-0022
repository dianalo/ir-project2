Interested persons were initially given until February 23, 1987,to comment on the proposal and to request a hearing. The comment period and the time for requesting an informal public hearingwere extended twice, first to June 1, 1987 (52 FR 5790) and then to August14, 1987 (52 FR 20616). In the last notice (52 FR 20616), OSHA also clarifiedthe scope of the proposed fall protection standard and its applicationto steel erection work. On June 9-10, 1987, OSHA consulted with the Advisory Committee On ConstructionSafety And Health (ACCSH) regarding the issues raised in the NPRMs. OSHAhad consulted with the ACCSH before publishing the proposals, but grantedthe committee's request for further consultation. In addition to makingrecommendations regarding the issues raised in the proposals, the ACCSHsuggested certain changes to the proposed regulations. In particular, theACCSH recommended that OSHA delete the sentence in proposed andSection; 1926.500(a)(1)which would exempt employers from proposed Subpart M ``when employees areonly inspecting, investigating or assessing workplace conditions.'' OSHAintended the sentence in question to apply only<T3> before</T3> construction work had been initiated at a workplace. Thefinal rule will clarify the scope of any exemption. OSHA is considering several ACCSH suggestions for inclusion in the revisedstandards. These suggestions are presented as hearing issues in order togenerate additional information. OSHA will use that information to decideif it should adopt the ACCSH suggestions. These suggestions, discussedin more detail below, are summarized as follows: andbullet; Locating scaffolds to avoid energized power lines contacting conductivematerials used on the scaffolds (issue L-5);andbullet; Banning the use of manila rope and plastic rope as top rails andmidrails in scaffold guardrail systems (Issue L-10);andbullet; Defining the terms ``ramp'' and ``runway'' which appear in proposedandSection; 1926.451(c)(4) (Issue L-12);andbullet; Specifying in proposed andSection; 1926.451(f)(2)(v) that a scaffoldcanopy shall not be more than nine feet above the working surface of thescaffold (Issue L-13); andbullet; Replacing the proposed requirement in andSection; 1926.502(c)(2)that safety nets extend at least 15 feet out from the structure with thefollowing requirement taken from draft ANSI A10.11, Safety Nets Used DuringConstruction, Repair and Demolition Operations (Issue M-4); Perimeter net systems shall extend outward horizontally from the outermostworking surface of the structure a distance equal to or greater than thedistance listed in the following table for the applicable fall distance:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,7</C> <H1>Distance of working level to horizontal plane of personnel net</H1><H1>Minimum required horizontal distance of outer edge of net from theedge of the working surface (Feet)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Up to 5 feet <D>8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">More than 5 feet to 10 feet <D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">More than 10 feet <D>13</D></ITAG></ITAG>andbullet; Making the note in andSection; 1926.1053(b)(7), which covers placementof ladders on slippery surfaces, part of the standard. (Issue X-1). The comments and objections received during the comment period focusedon several concerns regarding the provisions and the clarified scope ofthe proposed fall protection standards. In addition, OSHA received severalrequests for a public hearing. Accordingly, pursuant to section 6(b)(3)of the OSH Act, OSHA has scheduled an informal public hearing to beginon March 22, 1988, to receive testimony and other information pertinentto the issues raised in the hearing requests and at OSHA's initiative.Therefore, OSHA solicits testimony, with supporting information, on theissues presented below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart L </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81"/><T3>Issue L-1 </T3>In its NPRM of November 25, 1986, OSHA solicited publi comment (51 FR 42698,Issue Number 15) concerning proposed rule andSection; 1926.460(d) which wouldrequire training and retraining, as necessary, for all employees usingscaffolds. In particular, OSHA asked whether the training requirementsshould be less specific, following andSection; 1926.21, or more specificthan proposed. One commenter (Ex. 2-368) stated that employers should berequired, at least, to furnish employees working on scaffolds with printedsafety rules, require those employees to read the rules in the employer'spresence and question the employees to see if they understand the rules.That commenter also suggested that ``due to the extreme hazard associatedwith the use of suspended scaffolds, a written training program shouldbe required'' and that only employees certified to have completed the trainingprogram should be allowed to work on suspended scaffolds. Another commenter[Ex. 2-64], who requested a hearing, shared the belief that workers shouldbe required to complete the appropriate training and ``to carry a certificateor license which evidences completion'' of the training, prior to workingon suspended scaffolds. Also, one commenter (Exs. 2-2 andamp; 2-34), whorequested a hearing, recommended that OSHA establish a ``licensing procedure''for employees who construct or install scaffolding higher than five feet.OSHA requests testimony and related information on any programs currentlyoperating, whereby certificates or licenses are issued which indicate thatemployees have been adequately trained to erect, use or dismantle specifictypes of scaffolds. Based on the comments discussed above, OSHA is considering whether or notit should change the proposal by adding a new section on certificationto read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1926.461</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Certification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The employer shall certify that all employees who are erecting,maintaining and dismantling scaffolds, have been adequately trained inthe appropriate precautions and safe practices before they are allowedto perform any such scaffold work. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The employer shall certify that the employee has been trainedby preparing a certification record which includes the identity of theperson trained, the signature of the employer or the person who conductedthe training, and the date the training or retraining was completed. Thecertification record shall be prepared at the completion of training andshall be maintained on file for the duration of the employee's employment.The certification record shall be made available upon request to the AssistantSecretary for Occupational Safety and Health or designee.</ITAG>OSHA believes that such a certification would not require the collectionof ``information'' as defined in 5 CFR 1320.7(k)(1). Therefore, OSHA hasdetermined that, under the terms of the Paperwork Reduction Act and theimplementing regulations, the above language would not impose a paperworkburden on the employer. OSHA solicits testimony and other information onthe language set forth above.  <T3>Issue L-2  </T3>OSHA solicited comment (51 FR 42697, Issue Number 11) on the possibilityof lowering the 10 foot (3.0 m) maximum height, where work would be allowedwithout fall protection. The 10 foot limit is in existing andSection; 1926.451(a)(3)and in proposed andSection; 1926.451(e)(1).  In response to this issue, the ACCSH, at its meeting on June 9, 1987, (Tr.115-116), recommended that OSHA replace the 10 foot limit with a requirementto have fall protection on all scaffolds regardless of their height. OSHAsolicits testimony and related information on the ACCSH recommendation. <T3>Issue L-3  </T3>OSHA proposed (51 FR 42696) to delete the paragraph on ``Elevated and RotatingWork Platforms'' currently in andSection; 1926.451(f) because this paragraphwas redundant with the requirements of existing andSection; 1926.556, ``Aeriallifts,'' in Subpart N, ``Cranes, Derricks, Hoists, Elevators, and Conveyors''.Both current regulations incorporate ANSI A92.2-1969 by reference. Onecommenter (Ex. 2-368) stated that OSHA should not delete this section butshould instead, ``recognize'' the ANSI A92 series of provisions currentlyunder development, in a subsequent rulemaking proceeding. OSHA requeststestimony and related information on this recommendation.  <T3>Issue L-4  </T3>In the proposal, (51 FR 42699, Issue Number 20) OSHA asked if the Agencyshould prohibit or regulate the use of stilts. The Agency also asked whatregulation would be appropriate if the use of stilts were permitted. OSHAwas aware that some contractors feel they may not presently use stiltsbecause the existing construction standards do not specifically mentionthem (EX. 2-98). Many contractors, however, interpreted Issue 20 as thefirst step towards a ban on the use of stilts for construction work. Asa result, OSHA received over 460 comments in favor of allowing the useof stilts as a means of extending a worker's reach to do painting, finishingand other work on ceilings and walls. The comments stated that prohibitingthe use of stilts would cause employees to sustain injuries from over-reachingand falling from ladder, stools, platforms, homemade benches, boards, invertedbuckets and other devices they would otherwise use to elevate themselvesto do painting, finishing and ceiling work. Many of the comments also indicatedthat some safety provisions, such as debris control, are necessary.  On June 9, 1987, the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Healthconsidered prohibiting the use of stilts in all situations. However, theACCSH deferred any recommendations on Issue 20 pending the receipt of informationon the use of stilts in construction (Tr. 158-161).  Most of the comments reflect concern that OSHA plans to ban the use ofstilts. While OSHA concedes that the wording of Issue 20 may have causedsome confusion, the Agency intended the Issue to generate input solelyon the question of what regulations, if any, should be developed for theuse of stilts. OSHA's concern is with the proper use of stilts in all situationsand not just when they are used on top of another scaffold. Therefore,OSHA is considering whether or not, based on the comments received, theproposed standard should contain the following provisions:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Employees shall be prohibited from wearing stilts on scaffoldsexcept when the employees are on large area scaffolds.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) When employees are on large area scaffolds where guardrail systemsmeeting the requirements of andSection; 1926.451(e) are used to provide fallprotection, or the employees are on walking/working surfaces where guardrailsystems meeting the requirements of Subpart M are used to provide fallprotection, the guardrail system shall be increased in height an amountequal to the height of the stilts.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The surfaces on which stilts are used shall be flat and free ofpits, holes and obstructions, such as debris, as well as all other trippingand falling hazards.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Stilts shall be properly maintained and all alterations of theoriginal equipment shall be approved by the manufacturer.</ITAG>OSHA would be particularly interested in information which would help itdefine a ``large area scaffold'' and any other information bearing on theneed to use stilts while on a scaffold and on the appropriate safety measureswhen using stilts. Therefore, OSHA solicits information on this issue.Issue L-5Proposed andSection; 1926.451(d)(6) addresses the distance to be maintainedwhen scaffolds are used in proximity to energized power lines. One commenter(Ex. 2-103) suggested that OSHA require the employer to notify the powercompany when scaffolds are to be erected near energized power lines andrequest the power company to de-energize the line or provide protectivecovering to prevent accidental contact. This suggestion is similar to OSHA'sexisting Subpart P requirement for employees to notify utility companiesprior to excavating. Therefore, OSHA is considering whether or not, basedon the comment received, the proposed standard should contain the followingprovision:<ITAG tagnum="21">Prior to erecting scaffolds in proximity to energized power lines,the employer shall notify the utility company of the proposed work, andshall request that the lines be de-energized or that protective coveringsbe provided to prevent accidental contact with the power line.</ITAG>OSHA envisions that the above language would provide primary employee protectionfrom electrical shock hazards. In that case, OSHA would need to clarifythat proposed andSection; 1926.451(d)(6) would apply if the affected employercould not obtain assurances from the utility company that the lines hadbeen deenergized or adequately protected from contact. OSHA solicits testimonyand other information on the above language.In addition, on June 9, 1987, the ACCSH suggested (Tr. 204) that OSHA reviseproposed andSection; 1926.451(d)(6) to reflect concern that conductive materialhandled on a scaffold might contact exposed and energized lines even ifthe scaffold itself did not. To this end, the ACCSH recommended that proposedandSection; 1926.451(d)(6) read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Scaffolds shall not be erected, used or moved in such a way that theyor any conductive material handled on them can come closer to exposed andenergized power lines than as follows:***</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA solicits testimony and related information on the above language.Issue L-6Proposed andSection; 1926.451(c)(5)(ii) requires that integral prefabricatedscaffold rungs shall have a minimum rung length of 11\1/2\ inches. OSHAhas received a comment (Ex. 2-303) which states that scaffolds with integralprefabricated scaffold rungs which are eight inches, rather than the proposed11\1/2\ inches, ``provide safe access [to a work platform] equivalent tothat of a ladder.'' Further, the commenter states that the 8-inch rungs``provide surer footing and a better climb than does or can a ladder.''OSHA is considering whether or not, based on this comment, andSection; 1926.451(c)(5)(ii)should read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Have sufficient rung length to permit safe use as a means ofaccess. Rungs less than 11\1/2\ inches in length shall be used for accessonly and not as work platforms.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA solicits testimony and other specific information on the abovelanguage.Issue L-7In proposed andSection; 1926.451, OSHA sets forth ``General requirements''which apply to all scaffolds, including scaffolds used in smoke stack hoists(stack hoist scaffolds). OSHA is aware of ongoing efforts to update theANSI standard A10.22, Safety Requirements for Rope Guided and Non-GuidedWorkmen's Hoists, and is concerned that revised provisions may also beneeded in the OSHA standard to address the hazards unique to stack hoistscaffolds. For example, the platform and suspension systems that currentlyare being designed for use with stack hoists require design factors ashigh as 8.5 for imposed work loads and hoisting loads, as opposed to thedesign factor of 4 required under proposed andSection; 1926.451(a)(1). Therefore,the Agency solicits testimony and related information on the extent towhich proposed andSection; 1926.451 adequately covers stack hoists. OSHAalso requests testimony and information on any stack hoist hazards, orother scaffold hazards, not addressed by the general requirements.Issue L-8OSHA received two comments (Ex. 2-367 and 2-368) which suggested that theAgency add language to proposed andSection; 1926.452(c)(5) to specify thatside brackets on fabricated frame scaffolds ``shall be used to supportpersonnel only and shall not be used for storage or support of materials.''However, no reason was given for this suggested limitation. The Agencybelieves that this area is adequately covered by proposed andSection; 1926.451(a)(1),which sets forth capacity requirements, and proposed andSection; 1926.451(d)(1),which prohibits overloading. However, OSHA solicits testimony and supportinginformation as to whether the suggested change is necessary.Issue L-9OSHA received a comment (Ex. 2-23) which suggested that proposed andSection;1926.452(i), outrigger scaffolds, be revised to add requirements that outriggerbeams ``extend not more than 6 feet beyond the face of the building'' andthat ``open sides of the scaffold platform over 7\1/2\ feet above the groundshall be enclosed by a standard guardrail.'' OSHA notes that the commentercites ANSI A10.8-1977 in support of its suggestion. OSHA solicits testimonyand related information regarding this suggestion.Issue L-10On June 9, 1987, the ACCSH (Tr. 212) recommended that OSHA bar the useof manila rope and plastic rope as top rails and mid rails of guardrailsystems used on scaffolds. This recommendation reflected ACCSH concernthat manila rope and plastic rope lose strength quickly when exposed towater and sun. OSHA solicits testimony and related information on thisrecommendation.Issue L-11A commenter (Ex. 2-585), who requested a hearing, has suggested that thenumber of injuries and fatalities from falls would be reduced by using``tightly hung netting, which is both layered and wrapped around the scaffold.''The commenter noted that such netting ``is inexpensive and can be usedfor several projects.'' The commenter also noted that such nets are ``clearlyvisible at construction sites of any Japanese city.'' OSHA is not familiarwith this practice and solicits testimony and related information regardingthe use of netting on scaffolding systems.Issue L-12On June 9, 1987, the ACCSH suggested [Tr. 206] that OSHA add definitionsfor ``ramp'' and ``runway'' to the proposed standard so that the requirementsof andSection; 1926.451(c)(4) would be clearly understood. In particular,a member of the ACCSH recommended that the Agency use the definition oframp developed by the National Safety Council. OSHA solicits testimonyand related information on these suggestions.Issue L-13On June 9, 1987, the ACCSH noted [Tr. 214-15] that the requirements fora canopy which would protect employees below a scaffold from falling objects,as provided by proposed andSection; 1926.451(f)(2)(v), did not specify howfar above the employees the canopy could be. The ACCSH was concerned thata canopy set at 15 or 20 feet would not protect employees below. Therefore,the ACCSH recommended that OSHA specify nine feet as the proper heightfor a canopy. OSHA solicits testimony and related information on this suggestion.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart M</ITAG>Issue M-1Steel ErectionOSHA has consistently maintained that fall protection for steel erectionworkers, except to the extent expressly regulated by Subpart R, is coveredby existing andSection;andSection; 1926.28(a), 1926.104, 1926.105 and SubpartM. OSHA proposed, in the NPRM for fall protection (51 FR 42718), to consolidatethe provisions of andSection;andSection; 1926.104, 1926.105 and Subpart M intoa revised Subpart M. That proposal would not have amended the specificfall protection provisions contained in Subpart R. The Agency has receivedcomments which indicate some disagreement and confusion regarding the applicationof proposed Subpart M to steel erection work. OSHA recognizes that thesecomments are due, in part, to the manner in which the proposal and thesecond comment period extension notice discussed this issue.In the NPRM (52 FR 42736), OSHA set forth two provisions under andSection;1926.500 <T3>Scope, application and definitions applicable to this subpart</T3>,that contained exceptions to the proposed rule for employees performingsteel erection work. The first provision, andSection; 1926.500(a)(2)(iv)reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Section 1926.501 sets forth those workplaces, conditions, operations,and circumstances for which fall protection shall be provided except asfollows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Requirements relating to fall protection for connectors performingsteel erection and requirements for fall protection for workers on derrickand erection floors during steel erection, are provided in 29 CFR 1926.750-1926.752(Subpart R).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The second provision, andSection; 1926.500(a)(3)(iii) reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Section 1926.502 sets forth the requirements for the installation,construction, and use of fall protection required by andSection; 1926.501and by other subparts of Part 1926, except as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Specific requirements for safety railings used on derrick anderection floor during steel erection are provided in 29 CFR 1926.750 (SubpartR).</ITAG>The intent of these proposed provisions was only to exclude connectors,while they were making initial connections of steel framing members, fromcoverage under proposed Subpart M. Commenters, however, apparently didnot clearly understand which of the employees engaged in steel erectionactivities were to be covered by proposed Subpart M and which were to continueto be covered by Subpart R, Steel Erection.Indeed, one commenter (Ex. 2-17) stated what its view of proposed SubpartM would be if it were intended to apply to steel erection work and, also,what its position would be if Subpart M were not to cover steel erectionwork. Other commenters (Exs. 2-45 and 2-53) requested that OSHA more clearlystate the extent to which proposed Subpart M applied to steel erectionwork.In an effort to dispel the apparent confusion, OSHA included a discussionof the application of Subpart M to steel erection work when the Agencyextended the comment period on Subpart M for the second time (June 2, 1987,52 FR 20616). In that notice, OSHA stated that the Agency intended theproposed fall protection requirements published in the NPRM, to cover allworkers engaged in skeleton steel erection activities, except for thoseworkers identified as connectors who worked on the derrick or erectionfloor making initial connections of steel framing members. OSHA furtherstated that the provisions of Subpart R would continue to cover fall protectionfor connectors as well as requirements related to the erection process.As OSHA stated in that notice, and repeats here, Subpart R only addressesfall hazards at elevations of 30 feet and over; the Agency has consistentlymaintained that falls from under 30 feet for steel erection employees areregulated by andSection;andSection; 1926.28(a) and 1926.105(a). Indeed, onJuly 18, 1983, OSHA issued an instruction to the field, STD 3-3.1, whichoutlined how the fall protection requirements in andSection;andSection; 1926.28(a)and 1926.105(a) applied to construction work, including steel erectionwork.OSHA observed in the June 2, 1987 notice that the Advisory Committee onConstruction Safety and Health (ACCSH) at its meeting on March 31 and April1, 1987, agreed that the general fall protection requirements should bethe same for steel erection as for other construction activities. However,the ACCSH believed that an exemption was necessary for the making of initialconnections of steel framing members. (Tr. 200). OSHA also noted that theAgency was considering draft proposed revisions of the fall protectionprovisions for connectors as part of an anticipated separate rulemakingeffort for Subpart R.OSHA again met with the ACCSH on August 4, 1987, to discuss draft SubpartR revisions which were based, in part, on suggestions voted at the April1, 1987 ACCSH meeting. In particular, as discussed above, the ACCSH hadrecommended that OSHA apply the proposed Subpart M provisions, which wouldrequire fall protection for employees working six feet above lower levels,to steel erection employees, except connectors performing initial connectionwork. For connectors, ACCSH recommended that OSHA not require connectorsor other steel erection employees moving from point to point (one worklocation to another) to tie-off (use body belt/harness systems). OSHA notesthat under proposed Subpart M, the use of body belt/harness systems (tyingoff) is not the only option available for fall protection. The use of nets,in particular, is perfectly acceptable. While OSHA raised the existenceof other such fall protection equipment with the Advisory Committee, theACCSH declined to make any recommendations to OSHA regarding use of thatfall protection equipment by steel erection workers (Tr. 134-144).OSHA has received a comment (Ex. 2-145) from the Safety Advisory Committeefor the Structural, Ornamental, Rigging and Reinforcing Steel Industry(SAC), a labor-management group with the following membership: The InternationalAssociation of Bridge, Structural, and Ornamental Ironworkers; the NationalErectors Association; the National Association of Reinforcing Steel Contractors;the National Association of Miscellaneous, Ornamental and ArchitecturalSteel Contractors; the Specialized Carriers and Rigging Association; theNational Constructors Association; Institute of the Ironworking Industry;American Institute of Steel Construction; and the Allied Building MetalIndustry, Inc. The comment stated that connectors should not be requiredto tie off when erecting steel structures at heights of 30 feet or less.The SAC supported its suggestion as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">While the danger from falls obviously exists at heights above andbelow 30 feet, this committee feels that for purposes of establishing sometype of arbitrary standard, 30 feet is appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fall from a height greater than 30 feet may pose a significantly greaterdanger of severe injury which would justify the use of a safety belt orharness at those heights. At heights of 30 feet or less, we feel that theiron worker is generally more safe being unencumbered. Thirty feet is anarbitrary number which we feel sets a reasonable limit of allowing freedomof movement up to a certain height at which the potential degree of injuryincreases and then justifies requiring the iron worker connector to betied off.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The SAC also mentioned weather hazards, human error, and mechanicalor equipment failures as considerations which supported its viewpoint.The comment also stated that nets could not be used when working at 30feet or less, explaining, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * it is understood that the utilization of safety nets requiresa secure framework for attachment. Therefore, until a framework has beencompleted and secured, safety nets could not be attached. A two story structure(30 feet) could not be reasonably secured for safety nets until the secondstory framework is adequately secured. The utilization of safety nets wouldnot apply until the second story framework was secured or until additionalstories were erected to which the safety net system could be attached below.It is also understood that erecting the perimeter framework above a 30foot fall distance, or exposure to falls over 30 feet, would require theiron worker to either be tired off or be provided safety net protection.It is recognized by this Committee that the erection of safety nets under30 feet, may expose the connectors who would erect the safety nets, toa falling hazard for a longer length of time than not using the net systemat all. In these instances, rather than expose the safety net erector toa falling hazard, fall protection in the form of perimeter safety railand temporary or permanent flooring would provide greater protection andless exposure to falls to the employees.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In addition to recommending an exemption from proposed Subpart M forinitial connection work, the SAC recommended that workers moving from pointto point be exempt from fall protection until they reached a position wherethey could tie-off or otherwise have fall protection, because, accordingto the SAC, ``There is a great need for iron workers engaged in the erection,assembly, and placement of structural steel to have freedom of movementfrom one work place to another due to the particular requirements of theiron working industry.'' The SAC provided a list of 16 point-to-point taskswhere it considered fall protection inappropriate. The list was as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Bolt-up man moving from one location to another to install bolts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Welder moving from one location to another to weld.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Plumb-up crew moving from one location to another to align thesteel members.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Supervisors (foreman and pushers) moving from one location to anotherto supervise iron workers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Decking crew moving from one location to another to place, align,and install metal decking.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6.

OSHA observes thata public participant at the August 4, 1987 ACCSH meeting (Tr. 169) statedthat he, as an employer, requires connectors to ``tie off'' when they'renot in the actual process of connecting the iron. The participant explainedthat he felt connectors should be provided with body belts and lanyardsfor use when performing work where the probability of falling is increased.OSHA notes that one such case would be where a worker is using both handsto tighten a bolt and suddenly loses his balance. OSHA is particularlyinterested in learning more about the types and methods of fall protectioncurrently available for steel erection.OSHA has also received a comment (Ex. 2-137) which stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Connectors should have fall protection when fall hazards exceed sixfeet. Waist height perimeter cables can act as horizontal lifelines, canbe installed without fall hazard and can provide continuous protectionpast intermediate columns.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA would appreciate comment or testimony from any employers whoare using this or similar systems.OSHA has received comments in response to Issue andplusmin;2 of the NPRMon fall protection (51 FR 42729) regarding the need for all protectionduring operations such as erecting roof trusses and steel erection on otherthan tiered buildings. For example, one commenter (Ex. 2-92) stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Providing fall protection in these specific areas would be too restrictiveand unfeasible. These operations require frequent movement, generally forshort periods. Providing the necessary fall protection in these instanceswould expose those employees who are installing the equipment to more ofa hazard than those doing the actual work.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Additionally, any fall protection equipment installed becomes obstructiveto the erection operation.</ITAG>OSHA solicits testimony and related information on the concerns raisedby the commenter. The Agency also requests testimony and information whichwould further help OSHA determine what fall protection would be appropriateduring operations such as erecting roof trusses and steel erection on otherthan tiered buildings.The rulemaking record developed to date indicates that the Agency needsmore information in order to develop a revised standard covering fall protectionfor employees engaged in steel erection activities. The comments receivedto date have convinced the Agency to develop a separate proposed rule whichwill provide comprehensive coverage for fall protection in steel erection.OSHA intends, therefore, that the consolidation and revision of fall protectionprovisions in Subpart M not apply to steel erection and that the currentfall protection requirements of Part 1926 continue to cover steel erectionuntil the steel erection rulemaking is completed. Accordingly, in orderto maintain coverage under existing fall protection standards pending completionof the separate steel erection fall protection rulemaking, OSHA plans toredesignate existing andSection;andSection; 1926.104, 1926.105, 1926.107(b),1926.107(c), 1926.107(f), 1926.500 (with Appendix A), 1926.501, and 1926.502into Subpart R when the Agency issues the final rule for the Subpart Mrulemaking. OSHA is raising questions in this hearing notice in order toobtain information regarding current and suggested fall protection practicesin the steel erection industry. The Agency will use the information obtainedthrough the hearing and the reopened comment period in drafting a noticeof proposed rulemaking which would require the necessary fall protectionfor steel erection workers. OSHA solicits information, including testimonyor written comments, regarding the fall protection necessary for steelerection employees.OSHA seeks, in particular, input responsive to the following questions.<ITAG tagnum="25">_What feasibility concerns arise regarding the use of ladders, scaffolds,or elevating and rotating work platforms, such as ``cherrypickers,'' duringerection work?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_How feasible is the use of waist height perimeter cables as horizontallifelines or similar fall protection measures during steel erection work?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_As discussed above, OSHA has been asked to exempt connectors workingat less than 30 feet from the proposed fall protection requirements.

If not, should they?</ITAG>Issue M-2<ITAG tagnum="81">Concrete Erection</ITAG>The Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI) (Ex. 2-44) has commented thatfall protection for employees erecting precast concrete components is ``notappropriately covered by the proposed regulations'' in Subpart M, because,according to the PCI, concrete erectors, like steel erectors, need morefreedom of movement than proposed Subpart M would permit. Therefore, thePCI suggested that OSHA revise proposed Subpart M so that precast concreteerection would be regulated under Subpart R, Steel Erection. At the August4, 1987 ACCSH meeting, a PCI representative reiterated the view that connectorsof precast concrete members should be provided the same considerationsas connectors of steel members, saying [Tr. 212]: ``We feel that the erectionprocedures and exceptions for steel are basically the same as those forprecast concrete * * * Basically, the fall protection of the steel connector,again, would be the same as that for the precast connector.'' The PCI subsequentlysubmitted comments (Ex. 2-106 and 2-107) which requested that OSHA exemptconcrete erectors from proposed leading edge protection requirements inSubpart M and that OSHA exempt hollow core slab erectors from perimeterprotection provisions, except for those in proposed andSection; 1926.502(h),Safety monitoring systems. OSHA requests testimony and other informationon PCI's comments and suggestions.Issue M-3 <ITAG tagnum="81">Manila and Plastic Rope </ITAG>On June 9, 1987, the ACCSH recommended that OSHA add a ban on the use ofmanila rope or plastic rope for a toprail or midrail to the ban on theuse of steel or plastic banding in proposed Subpart L, andSection; 1926.451(e)(4)(xiii),which covers scaffold guardrail systems. ACCSH expressed concern that manilarope and plastic rope lose strength quickly when exposed to water and sunand, therefore, would be inappropriate for use as top rails or midrailsof scaffold guardrail systems. While the ACCSH did not repeat this recommendationin the course of reviewing Subpart M, OSHA believes the same concern appliesto guardrail systems covered by proposed Subpart M. Therefore, OSHA isconsidering whether or not, based on the ACCSH recommendation, it shouldrevise the proposed fall protection requirements by adding the followinglanguage to paragraph (b) of andSection; 1926.502; Manila rope and plasticrope shall not be used as top rails or midrails of quardrail systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA solicits testimony and other information on this language. Issue M-4 On June 10, 1987, the ACCSH noted [Tr. 198-199] that proposed andSection;1926.502(c)(2), which requires that safety nets extend 15 feet out fromthe structure, was based on a National Bureau of Standards (NBS) studywhich indicated that nets which extended 8 feet from a structure, as requiredunder existing andSection; 1926.105(c)(1), would not catch someone who hadfallen 25 feet. The ACCSH also noted that the ANSI A10.11 Committee, whichdevelops consensus standards for safety nets, had reviewed the NBS studyand determined that it was appropriate to account for the distance fromthe working surface to the net when setting new net requirements. The ACCSHagreed with the ANSI A10.11 Committee recommendation that nets be set out8 feet when employees are 5 feet, or less, above them, 10 feet when theemployees are between 5 and 10 feet above, and 13 feet when employees aremore than 10 feet above the nets. Therefore, the ACCSH suggested that OSHAreplace the proposed 15 foot requirement with the draft ANSI A10.11 provisions.The Agency requests testimony and related information on this recommendation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart X </ITAG>Issue X-1 At its June 10, 1987, meeting, the Advisory Committee on Construction Safetyand Health (ACCSH) recommended that OSHA make the ``Note'' in proposedandSection; 1926.1053(b)(7) a part of the standard. (Tr. 45). OSHA is considering,based on that recommendation, whether or not it should change the proposalto read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">Section 1926.1053(b)(7) Ladders, including those with slip-resistantfeet, shall not be used on slippery surfaces unless they are secured toprevent accidental displacement. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA solicits comments on the above language. Issue X-2 The ACCSH at its June 10, 1987, meeting raised an issue concerning thesafe method of climbing ladders and the need for employees to carry materialsor equipment up and down on ladders [Tr. 13-19]. An Advisory Committeemember suggested that whenever a worker needed to take an item up a ladder,he should attach it to his belt or attach it to a hand line so that whenhe climbed to his work station he could pull it up. The committee thereuponrecommended that ``Nothing shall be carried up a ladder which will preventthe employee from having one hand on the ladder at all times.'' (Tr. 18).OSHA is considering, based on the ACCSH recommendation and existing andSection;1910.25(2)(vii) and 1910.26(3)(v), if it should change the proposal byadding new provisions to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">Section 1926.1053(b)(18) When ascending or descending a lader, theuser shall be directed to face the ladder. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 1926.1053(b)(19) Employees shall be prohibited from carryinganything up or down a ladder which prevents the climber from having atleast one hand on the ladder at all times. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA solicits comments on the above language. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation </ITAG>Comments Written comments regarding the fall protection requirements appropriatefor employees performing steel erection work must be postmarked by March8, 1988.
