Sulfur dioxide emissions are caused bythe combustion of fossil fuels for power production and various industrialprocesses. Kentucky's utilities and industries have already achievedconsiderable reductions. Further reductions would require new strategieswhich could be costly and difficult to implement, and which could affector be affected by numerous economic, technical, and social concerns.Presently, there are several methods available for removing sulfur dioxideemissions. The Kentucky State Acid Rain (STAR) Project is an attemptnot only to aid in understanding the problem of acid deposition, butalso to generate information which will be valuable in determining potentialbenefits and costs of carious control measures for achieving additionalsulfur dioxide reductions should future acid rain legislation so mandate.The objectives of the STAR Project are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
