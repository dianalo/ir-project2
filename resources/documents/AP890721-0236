Analysts said four days of showers in the western Corn Belt hadrevived corn and soybean crops, and forecasts for the coming weekpredicted no return to the withering heat of late June and earlyJuly.   News that federal regulators had ordered Italian grain merchantFerruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. to reduce its holdings in thenow-expired July futures contract last week also weighed on thesoybean market, analysts said.   The news prompted worries that Ferruzzi might be ordered toreduce its position in the August contract.   But Ted Mao, a grain specialist in New York with Shearson LehmanHutton Inc., said the Ferruzzi news was a minor factor in Friday'smarket.   ``The market in general has been responding to better weather,''he said.   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents lower to { cent higher with thecontract for delivery in September at $3.95{ a bushel; corn was }cent lower to 1 cent higher with September at $2.39\ a bushel; oatswere 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with September at $1.50 a bushel;and soybeans were 3 cents to 7} cents lower with August at $6.74 abushel.</TEXT></DOC>
