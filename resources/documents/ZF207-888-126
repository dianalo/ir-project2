 400 on Reader Service CardandM;Since the dawn of the Information Age, megabytes upon megabytes of textualdata have been accumulating daily.andP;  Those users who are faced with the taskof pawing through such mountains of information on-line must long for quickerand easier ways to find what they're seeking.andM;The problem is how to search through huge amounts of text to find thatsingle, all-important word of phrase.andP;  Two traditional approaches to thistask are indexed and non-indexed text retrieval systems.andM;Indexed systems create a listing of keywords in their text database, withentries pointing to each document in which a particular keyword appears.andO;Most indexed systems take longer to set up than non-indexed systems, but theyreduce the time needed to find documents with a particular word or phrase ifthat word or phrase is in the index.andM;One criticism of indexed systems is that because some words are used veryfrequently, they cannot be indexed and so cannot be searched for.andP;  Thesewords are called stopwords.andM;Non-indexed systems, on the other hand, make &quot;brute-force&quot; searches throughthe entire text of every document in a text database.andP;  If the processor thathas to do this work is the system CPU, the search tends to be very slow.andP;  Agood example of this approach is the SEARCH command in VMS, which takes quitea long time to go through a large set of documents.andM;DOING THINGS THE HARDWARE WAYandM;Gescan International has moved the task of non-indexed text retreival off thesystem CPU and onto its own hardware, a text array processor that it callsGescan.andP;  The company's system retrieves text with array-processor-basedhardware that uses term matching to search sequentially through non-indexedtext.andM;Gescan's text array processor has a logic resolution processor board, aninterface control unit and as many as six term-match processor (TMP) boards(Fig.andP;  1).andM;Each TMP board has three array processors that can handle 1,000 charactersand has 1KB of memory for storage of query terms.andP;  The logic resolutionprocessor handles the query structure and determines how results from theTMPs relate to the query.andP;  The interface control unit handles the flow ofdata to and from the host interface.andM;Queries are downloaded to a TMP as the first part of a search.andP;  Amultiple-word query can be split across different TMPs, but single-wordsearches are always handled by one TMP.andP;  The data to be searched is loadedinto a 64-byte search queue memory and then routed through a translationtable.andP;  The translation table checks for certain characters that woulddesignate a file mark, as well as converting all the alphabetic characters touppercase characters.andP;  Then the data goes to the TMP, which checks for amatch with the query in its memory.andM;The TMPs run concurrently and search for full eight-bit matches, not justseven-bit ASCII character matches.andP;  This allows users to search for wordsthat include alternate character sets that use the full eight bits.andP;  Cyrilliccharacters are supported as a software option.andM;If a match is found, it is reported to the system's logic resolutionprocessor.andP;  All matches for a given query are kept track of by thisprocessor, which processes these matches to increment a threshold counter,set a match flag or check proximity.andP;  This is where the logic of the query isworked out.andM;The interface control unit handles the input and output of data to and fromthe text array processor.andP;  This interface control unit talks to a DMA (directmemory access) board that is installed on the host VAX.andP;  The DMA board,supplied to Gescan by MDB Systems, emulates DEC's DR11-W DMA board.andM;For our review, installation of Gescan began with installing the DMA boardinto a quad-height slot on the backplane of our MicroVAX II.andP;  Next we loadedversion 3.7 of the Gescan software (which requires VMS version 5.1) from thedistribution tape.andP;  Then we ran the installation procedure to installGescan's help files in the standard VMS help library and to build a copy ofthe DCL tables with Gescan symbols.andP;  This copy is then assigned to be thecommand table for anyone using Gescan in the Gescan login command procedure.andM;It's worth noting that Gescan International will install its Gescan productfor customers without charge.andM;After installation and each time the system is rebooted, the initializationprocedure needs to be run to get Gescan on-line.andP;  This procedure loads thedriver for the DMA board and starts the background processes that handleprinting, querying, creating and updating hit files (which show the resultsof queries), and auditing.andP;  In less than two hours we were hot on the trialof words in the demo database.andM;Although Gescan's approach to text retrieval is based primarily on hardware,it also relies on software running on the host CPU.andP;  The Gescan softwareallows users to load text, search text and create reports, as well as todevelop site-specific programs with the Gescan command library that can becompiled in any major language.andP;  Although the software does not have theslickest user interface we have seen for text retrieval systems, it is cleanand fast.andP;  We thought it better suited to the experienced computer user thanto the novice.andM;The software has five components: one for database manipulation, another formaking queries, another for defining fields to categorize the information indatabase documents, another for reviewing the results of queries in hit filesand another for building a thesaurus.andP;  Commands can be issued from withineach facility as well as from the DCL prompt.andP;  Commands relating to eachfacility begin with corresponding letters: D for database, Q for queries, Ffor fields, H for hit files and T for the thesauruses.andM;To enter the database facility for the demo database that was provided byGescan, we entered the command-DBROWSE DEMODB at the DCL $ prompt.andP;  Thisbrings up the DBROWSE[is greater than] prompt.andM;The database facility gives users the tools for building a text database.andO;Databases can be built by entering each document by hand with the CREATEcommand at the DBROWSE[is greater than] prompt or by using the COPY commandat the DBROWSE[is greater than] prompt.andP;  Databases can also be built in batchmode (adding a large number of documents) by using the DGEN command from VMSor by writing a program incorporating commands from the Gescan library.andM;Gescan allows as many as 255 fields to be created within a document.andP;  Fieldscan be created at the time data is first entered or long after.andP;  Fields canbe spread throughout a document and need not be in any specific order; notevery document needs to have every field.andM;Once a database is built, the DBROWSE command allows users to inspect itsequentially or skip to a specific document by number.andP;  Each document isnumbered in the order in which it is added to the database.andM;FIND ME A FINDandM;Like database functions, query functions can be run from the query facilityor directly from the DCL prompt.andP;  These can be straight word searches,searches using fixed-length wildcards, searches using variable-lengthwildcards, searches within fields, searches within a defined set of words,searches using Boolean logic, proximity searches and searches within ranges.andM;The QEDIT command helps users build a query with a window that allows thequery to be edited in a tabular form (Fig.andP;  2).andP;  The user can build as manyas four term groups to be searched for and can define the relations betweenthose groups.andM;The relations that can be defined are limited, however.andP;  For example,proximity can only be defined between groups 1 and 2 or groups 3 and 4.andP;  ALOGIC line on the summary screen can be used to further define relationsbetween term groups, but we found little documentation about how this line isused.andM;We found that command-line searches were easier to work with, especially aspart of a VMS command procedure where they could be edited, run, re-editedand run again with relative ease.andM;Gescan queries can be run in two different ways.andP;  A query can be done eitheron files that are already in a database or on files as they are added to adatabase.andP;  The latter method is called a profile query.andM;Gescan is available with software that captures news-wire stories, and it isideal for profile queries.andP;  A profile query can be set up so that when itfinds a document of interest to certain users, the document can be sent tothose users via mail, or those users can be notified that a story of interesthas been entered in the database.andM;Making the query functions more useful is the thesarus facility.andP;  Thisfacility allows users to develop their own tables of synonyms.andP;  Themenu-driven interface lets as many as 3,000 characters' worth of words bedefined as synonyms for a single word.andP;  There is no limit to the number ofsynonym definitions that can be in one thesarus.andM;To use a thesaurus when making a query, a user simply adds the/THESAURUS=[thesaurus-name] qualifier after entering the QSEARCH command oruses the SYNONYM command at the QEDIT[is greater than] prompt; thisautomatically draws in any synonyms in the thesaurus that match the word inthe term group the user is working with.andM;Queries are handled in the background by the GESCAN SCANDR process, leavingusers at the prompt so they can do other work.andP;  They can either browsethrough the hit list of query results while the query is still progressing orthey can wait until Gescan notifies them that their query has completed.andM;The results of a query are handled by the GESCAN HITMAN process and depositedin a hit file.andP;  Hit files contain pointers to documents in the database thatsatisfied the query.andP;  Users can browse through a hit file by using theHBROWSE command, use these files to conduct further queries, or use them toupdate the database with annotations, modifications or deletions.andM;In order to immediately browse through the results of a query, a user can addthe /BROWSE qualifier when using the QSEARCH command.andP;  This will bring theuser into HBROWSE, where the first document found will be displayed on thescreen.andP;  If no documents are found, a search results window will bedisplayed.andP;  Commands like FIRST and LAST allow quick movement from onedocument to another.andM;One nice feature about both browse commands, DBROWSE and HBROWSE, is theability to map command sequences to certain keys.andP;  With the use of aninitialization file, a complex sequence of commands--such as &quot;move to thenext document, then move to the search word within  that document, then moveto first document, then exit&quot;--can all be mapped to the PF1 key with thecommand PF1:==NEXT|[is less than]Tab[is greater than]|FIRST.andM;One flaw in Gescan is that it lacks a means to recall the last commandissued.andM;A reporting facility is available for generating reports on hit files thatresult from queries.andP;  The HREPORT command allows the use of a template filefor form letters or columnar reports.andM;Modifications can be made to documents seen using the HBROWSE command.andP;  TheANNOTATION command puts the user in EDT to write an annotation that, whensaved, will be appended to the current document.andP;  In addition, the EDITcommand lets the user edit the current document; the changes can be saved tothe database permanently.andM;Gescan supports certain security measures that will keep text databases safefrom prying eyes.andP;  VMS protection of files associated with a given databasecan be used in order to control their use, and additional restrictions can beimposed by using the DSET command.andP;  From DSET a text database can be set toallow or disallow updates, browsing and searches.andM;In addition to restricting access to files, the DSET command provides anauditing facility.andP;  This facility keeps track of the creation, viewings,modifications, annotations and deletions that are made to documents.andM;To observe auditing, users can go to a particular document with the BROWSEcommand and use the ACTIVITY command.andP;  An easy-to-understand screen displayshows all activity on a document or shows specific activities, such asannotations.andP;  This facility is helpful in tracing corruption of a textdatabase by the careless user.andP;  Even after a document is deleted, itsactivity record can remain.andM;To test the capabilities of Gescan, we copied 10,290 files from DigitalReview's editorial production system, which totaled 64,401 disk blocks (32.7million characters) when finally loaded.andP;  Loading the files took very littlework on our part; all that was needed to load the VMS files out of a singledirectory was the command DBGEN /NOCONFIRM/DATABASE=[database-name]DUC0:[TEST]*.*;*andM;These files were mostly non-standard text files loaded as straight text withno predetermined fields.andM;READY, SET, QUERYandM;The queries we used to test Gescan were designed to cover all the differentquery structures.andP;  They range from simple to complex.andP;  (See table, below).andO;Measurements of the CPU time used by the GESCAN SCANDR process and the GESCANHITMAN process are also included to identify the CPU overhead involved.andM;The first thing we noticed was that Gescan's performance did not degradesignificantly as the queries became more complex.andP;  The query (SYSTEM ANDOPTICAL) OR (SYSTEM AND DECADE) took less time than the query OPTICAL.andP;  Bothhad roughly the same number of hits, and the former query is about threetimes more complex.andM;There was also no significant difference in performance between when Gescanwas using one TMP and when it was using three.andP;  We suspect that if more userswere added and the load were increased, single-TMP performance would suffer.andO;DR Labs plans to test this theory in a future review.andM;IT'S A HITandM;We did notice, however, that performance degraded as the number of hits for aquery increased.andP;  For example, it took about 50 percent longer to complete asearch for every occurrence of SYSTEM, which was found 4,249 times, than tofind every occurrence of DECOMPOSE, which appeared only five times.andP;  Gescanofficials explained that the GESCAN HITMAN process that operates in thebackground has to handle more activity when there are many hits, which canslow down the query.andM;One thing that should be noted is the Gresham brings the user to the firstdocument it finds while further searching goes on in the background.andP;  Becausethe user does not have to wait for all the documents to be found beforebrowing through the first ones, the wait for long searches like SYSTEM tocomplete is unnoticeable.andM;Overall, Gescan's performance was very impressive.andP;  We didn't have to waitlonger than six minutes for any of our queries, and the first document wasusually found in 30 to 60 seconds.andM;Prices for the Gescan system are straightforward, and there is no limit onthe number of databases that can be used with it.andP;  The entry-level unit, aQ-bus version with one TMP board and basic software, is $25,000.andP;  GescanInternational's recommended entry-level BI-bus and Unibus versions come withtwo and four TMPs and are priced at $35,000 and $40,000, respectively.andO;Additional TMPs are $4,000, and each Gescan unit can handle as many as sixTMPs.andP;  The software that handles incoming news-wires is $3,000.andP;  Otherleading text retrieval systems range in price from $5,000 to $179,000.andO;Gescan's pricing system does not penalize customers for having larger, fasterCPUs.andM;Gescan also offers its text retrieval system as a turnkey system coupled witha MicroVAX II or MicroVax 3000-series machine.andP;  Prices for turnkey systemsstart at $69,000.andP;  An interface that resembles Lexis, a standard legalretrieval system, is also available, for $7,500.andM;We found Gescan to be a very flexible text retrieval system, especially whenloading documents into a database.andP;  The Gescan system also performed wellwhen retrieving documents from a very large database.andM;Gescan has announced support for DEC's Compound Document Architecture (CDA),as have other text retrieval systems in the DEC market.andM;In a future issue, DR Labs will compare Gescan to these other systems using asuit of queries, as well as a benchmark database suitable for comparison in amultiuser environment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
