Source: Santa Clara County TrafficAuthority; This week's backup: North First Street; What: Closing ramp fromsouthbound Highway 101.; When: Late this week through December.; Why: To buildan elevated ramp that will eventually widen to three lanes.; Headache: Don'tmiss the detours; otherwise getting back to First Street will be a chore.;Detour No. 1: Trimble Road to First Street. The easier one; don't miss it.;Detour No. 2: Guadalupe Parkway, left on Airport Parkway, right on OldBayshore Highway to First Street. Lots of turns in heavy traffic.  </CAPTION><DESCRIPT>  TRAFFIC; ROAD; CONSTRUCTION; TRANSPORTATION; QA  </DESCRIPT><LEADPARA>  Q When going south on Highway 101, the exit to Interstate 280/680 used to betwo lanes. But suddenly and without warning, a barrier angles in and closesthe left lane. It's hard to see, especially as the sun sets, and a lot ofdrivers have been slamming on their brakes, myself included. This is terriblydangerous. Why isn't there more warning?;   Linda Knowles, San Jose  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DRIVERS POINT OUT BARRIER TO SAFETY ON FREEWAY RAMP  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Road Show  </MEMO><TEXT>  A There is now. After relaying your message and that of several others -- somewho reported numerous spin-outs -- Caltrans crews spent Friday laying down amerge arrow onto the pavement to warn motorists. The lane, by the way, isclosed to widen the shoulder.;   Q Is the realigning of Highway 17 betweenLark and Camden avenues still going to begin next month?;   Sylvia Alt, SanJose; A No, mid-January is the latest estimate. That's when all four laneswill be rerouted 200 yards to the east, which is the reason for all the workcurrently going on.;   Q When Caltrans was repaving Highway 17, another carkicked up some loose gravel and put a ding into my windshield, and it nowthreatens to become a large crack. Does Caltrans compensate for such things?;  Tom Leary, Santa Cruz; A Unlikely, but you can call Caltrans at (800)696-5408 and lodge your complaint.;   Q The congestion southbound on OldOakland Road at Highway 101 is horrendous every evening -- I've spent nearly30 minutes without moving because construction funnels two lanes into one. Whydon't crews redirect traffic to the 10th Street bridge? They can do this witha detour running from Charles Street to 15th Street and then to Old BayshoreHighway. And if they make the shoulder into a turn lane at Old Oakland andBayshore, cars there can also take the detour. Now cars get ticketed fordriving on a useless shoulder.;   Woods Mattingly, San Jose; A Great idea. Andthe folks with the Santa Clara County Traffic Authority, who are in charge ofthe 101 work, are considering the exact changes you recommend. Look for anannouncement soon.;   Q What's the purpose of the monster fence at thenortheast corner of Lawrence Expressway and Highway 237?;   Bob Gerenser,Milpitas; A It's a sound wall, but the answer involves Sunnyvale Baylands Parkto the north. The environmental people believe this fence is a morenatural-looking wall and preserves the dignity of the park better than themore common masonry block wall.;   Q Why has traffic been so awful going homethe past few weeks? It's been like Los Angeles.;   Linda Marsh, San Jose; ABlame the change from daylight-saving time, say numerous traffic officials,who explain that it usually takes several weeks for rush-hour traffic toadjust to driving in the dark.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911118  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  562  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, November 18, 199100323047,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
