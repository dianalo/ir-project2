The five missiles were part of the same production lot and AirForce investigators discovered a common problem that forced thesafety action, the Washington Post said.   The service is still trying to decide how to repair the fivemissiles, each of which is designed to carry 10 warheads, the paperadded, quoting unidentified sources.   The Air Force refused to confirm the account on Wednesday,acknowledging only that a single MX missile had been taken off alertlast June following an accident.   That accident previously had been reported by newspapers inWyoming, where F.E. Warren Air Force Base is located. The nation'sMX, or Peacekeeper, missiles are all deployed at F.E. Warren.   The Air Force also insisted Wednesday, without elaborating, thatthe nation's entire MX force of 50 missiles was on alert ``at thistime.''   ``We have 50 missiles that are deployed and operational at thistime,'' said Lt. Col. Don Christianson, a spokesman at F.E. Warren.   Christianson refused to say whether any problem missiles had beenreplaced with new missiles in order to maintain the alert force.   The spokesman agreed, however, that one MX missile had been takenoff alert, its warheads removed and its components broken down aspart of a safety investigation after an incident last June.   ``Last summer, we received indications of an electricaldisconnection with a Peacekeeper (MX) missile inside its silo,''Christianson said.   ``An investigation was conducted, and a structural failure in asupport skirt was found to be the cause. There was no safety threat.The reports of the investigation are classified, however, so I can'tgo further.''   The Post said Wednesday the missile had fallen between six inchesand a foot when it came ``unglued'' from its underground launchcanister. The canister envelops the missile and is used to propelthe four-stage MX from its silo before the main rocket motor isignited.   The newspaper said the fall of the 195,000-pound missile wassufficient to cause ``grave damage'' and to require ``extensiverepairs.'' And when the Air Force further investigated the matter,it concluded the missile was one of a batch of five that had beensubject to a particular production problem, the paper said.   Air Force officials responded by ordering removal of the10-warhead packages atop each of the other four suspect missiles torelieve the weight and pressure on their canister bonds pendingcorrective action, the paper concluded.   The Air Force so far has been authorized to build 50 of themissiles and to deploy them at F.E. Warren.   Former President Ronald Reagan pushed Congress for permission tobuild 50 more MX missiles and to base them on mobile rail-carlaunchers. The administration of President Bush has yet to make afinal decision on whether to push that same program or endorseanother program to develop a truck-mounted, single-warhead Midgetmannuclear missile.</TEXT></DOC>
