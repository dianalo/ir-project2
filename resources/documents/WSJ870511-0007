Capitol Federal Savings Bank, Mount Pleasant, Iowa, which had assets of $159.8 million, was declared insolvent and closed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its deposits were transferred to Midwest Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of Minneapolis, in Minneapolis.    Moreauville State Bank, Moreauville, La., which had assets of $16.8 million, was closed by state authorities and was purchased by Mansura State Bank, Mansura, La., the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.    Also, Farmer State Bank, Maddock, N.D., which had assets of $11.8 million, was closed by state authorities. North Dakota law prevented the sale of its assets, but the FDIC transferred its deposits to Ramsey National Bank andamp; Trust Co., Devils Lake, N.D.    Capitol Federal's offices are to reopen today as branches of Midwest Federal. The Bank Board replaced Capitol Federal's management in 1984 and took control of the thrift in 1986, but the institution continued to incur significant losses, the Bank Board said.    Moreauville State's two offices are to become branches of Mansura State. The failed bank held deposits of $16.9 million in 4,600 accounts. Moreauville State was the third Louisiana bank to fail this year. </TEXT></DOC>
