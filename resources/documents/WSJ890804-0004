The Shiite group holding Joseph Cicippio, which calls itself the Revolutionary Justice Organization, announced in Lebanon that it is &quot;freezing&quot; a threat to kill him. The group seemed to suggest that Iran may have interceded to put off the execution. But it also significantly upped the ante in the hostage drama by saying it isn't demanding merely the release of a Shiite leader kidnapped last week by Israel but also the release of an unspecified number of Palestinian and Lebanese Shiite prisoners held by Israel.    The statement said the proposal would be withdrawn if it isn't acted on &quot;within days.&quot; That implied that the death sentence could be reimposed, but the statement didn't explicitly say so.    If Mr. Cicippio had been killed, administration officials said, his murder probably would have brought military retaliation by President Bush. The president's &quot;leanings would have been toward taking some action&quot; against a site on a list of military targets in Lebanon developed by the Pentagon, one administration aide said.    Some officials regard the move as an encouraging sign that the Shiite groups holding hostages in Lebanon -- most of which are believed to be affiliated with the Hezbollah political and military organization -- may be interested in Israel's offer to swap Western hostages for Moslem prisoners held by Israel. Diplomatic sources said Israel has been holding discussions with Shiite leaders or their intermediaries inside Lebanon.    The U.S. has told Israel that the Bush administration won't participate in any effort to swap prisoners held by Israel for U.S. hostages because doing so would violate U.S. policy against negotiating with terrorists. But the administration also is signaling to Israel that it won't try to stop the Israelis from brokering such a deal. White House officials expressed relief that Mr. Cicippio had been spared and that the administration has dodged, at least temporarily, tough decisions on military retaliation. But privately, some administration aides also were troubled by the terrorists' gambit, fearing the Bush administration may be slipping into a cycle of successive terrorist threats that will preoccupy the U.S. government and draw attention to extremists' demands.    &quot;Clearly they're milking this for all they can,&quot; said one senior Bush administration official.    The suspension of the death threat against Mr. Cicippio ended the immediate pressure on President Bush to prepare for a military strike against either Lebanese extremists or Iran, the country the extremists look to for inspiration. Since a terrorist group calling itself the Organization for the Oppressed on Earth claimed on Monday to have killed Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, U.S. Navy ships have been steaming in the direction of Lebanon and Iran.    Pentagon planners continued working on military options, but Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney left Washington Wednesday to spend a long weekend in his native Wyoming. A Pentagon spokesman, Fred Hoffman, said Mr. Cheney plans to deliver a speech on environmental matters and attend the 30th reunion of his high school class in Casper during the weekend.    But while the military option may fade for a few days, the hostage drama is opening intriguing diplomatic possibilities. One is that Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who took office just yesterday, is heeding U.S. threats that Iran would be held responsible for the death of Mr. Cicippio and is helping to restrain the terrorists. The captors said they were putting off Mr. Cicippio's killing &quot;out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states with whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution.&quot;    If he is willing to restrain the terrorists, Mr. Rafsanjani could use the current crisis to demonstrate to the Bush administration that he will temper Iranian behavior. White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the administration can't point to &quot;any specific improvements&quot; in relations with Iran, but he said the White House hopes the groundwork has been laid for improvements in the future.    The other diplomatic possibility is that Hezbollah and its splinter terror groups may be considering the Israeli offer of a swap in which Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, the captured Shiite religious leader, and other Lebanese Shiites held by Israel would be released in return for all Western hostages in Lebanon. Publicly, Hezbollah has rejected the idea. But Israeli officials insist that there remains a chance for some kind of exchange.    ---   John J. Fialka contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
