By DelegationOrder No. 0204-108, effective May 30, 1986, 51 FR 19744 (May 30, 1986),the Secretary of Energy delegated to the Administrator the authority todevelop power and transmission rates, and delegated to the Under Secretarythe authority to confirm, approve, and place in effect such rates on aninterim basis and delegated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC) the authority to confirm, approve, and place in effect on a finalbasis or to disapprove rates developed by the Administrator under the delegation.By DOE N 1110.29 dated October 27, 1988, published at 54 FR 3841 (January26, 1989) the Secretary redelegated the authority from the Under Secretaryto the Deputy Secretary to approve such rates on an interim basis. Thisrate order is issued pursuant to the delegation to the Deputy Secretary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Power from the Cumberland Basin Projects is presently sold under WholesalePower Rate Schedules CBR-1-A, CSI-1-A, CEK-1-A, CC-1-B, CM-1-A, CK-1-Aand CTV-1-A confirmed and approved through June 30, 1989. Wholesale PowerRate Schedules CBR-1-A, CSI-1-A, CEK-1-A, CC-1-A, CM-1-A, CK-1-A and CTV-1-Awere approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by order issuedDecember 27, 1984, for a period beginning July 1, 1984, and ending June30, 1989. Wholesale Power Rate Schedule CC-1-B, which replaced CC-1-A,was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Order issuedJanuary 20, 1987, for a period beginning September 1, 1986, and endingJune 30, 1989.Public Notice and CommentOpportunities for public review and comment on Wholesale Power Rate SchedulesCBR-1-B, CSI-1-B, CEK-1-B, CC-1-C, CM-1-B, CK-1-B and CTV-1-B, proposedfor use during the period July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1989, were announcedby Notice published in the Federal Register on February 14, 1989, and allcustomers were notified by mail. A Public Information and Comment Forumwas held in Nashville, Tennessee, on March 21, 1989, and written commentswere invited by the Notice through May 3, 1989. No comments were presentedat the forum and written comments were received prior to May 3, 1989. Allcomments were evaluated by Southeastern. A summary of six substantial commentsevaluated follows:<T3>Comment 1: </T3>Southeastern sells power at rates less than market.Response: The Flood Control Act of 1944 and RA 6120.2 establish that ratesshall be prepared at cost, not market.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Underestimated costs and overestimated revenues havebeen borne by the taxpayer.Response: Southeastern does not agree with this statement. All costs ofthe power systems are borne by the rate payers. If costs are underestimatedor revenues are overestimated, then the differences are made up in futureyears plus interest.<T3>Comment 3: </T3>End the 5-year limitation on rate adjustments.Response: One commenter suggested that it is important to get rid of the5-year limitation on rate filings. Southeastern agrees and will attemptto do that on any new contracts signed.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>End the rolling repayment on normal investments.Response: One commenter believes that when Southeastern adds a new investment,it extends the life of all other investments to 50 years from the lastinvestment. Southeastern does not have a rolling repayment period. Eachinvestment must be repaid within 50 years of the time it is placed in service.<T3>Comment 5: </T3>Southeastern should implement repayment reform as proposedby the 1990 budget.<T3>Response: </T3>The Department of Energy may propose legislation toimplement repayment reform. When that legislation is enacted into law,Southeastern will conform to the legislation. Until then, Southeasternwill follow the DOE regulation RA 6120.2 to establish rates.<T3>Comment 6: </T3>Eliminate the practice of paying high interest bearinginvestment first whenever possible.<T3>Response: </T3>The DOE regulation RA 6120.2 establishes the methodof amortization.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>System RepaymentAn examination of Southeastern's system power repayment study preparedin May 1989 for the Cumberland Basin Projects reveals that with an annualrevenue increase of $4,485,000, over the current revenues shown in theprevious February 1989 repayment study, all system power costs are paidwithin their repayment life. Additionally, it appears that Wholesale PowerRate Schedules CBR-1-B, CSI-1-B, CEK-1-B, CC-1-C, CM-1-B, CK-1-B and CTV-1-Bare designed so as to produce revenue adequate to recover on a timely basisall system power costs. The Administrator of Southeastern has certifiedthat the rates are consistent with the applicable law and that they arethe lowest possible rates to customers consistent with sound business principles.Rate DesignAfter consultation with TVA and other customers, three areas were consideredin the design of rates. These areas are the allocation of generation costsbetween capacity and energy, the proper amount of transmission within theTVA area to be paid by the customers outside the TVA area, and the levelof reserve for contingencies. Southeastern has allocated approximately60 percent of the generation costs to energy and 40 percent to capacity.This is similar to the allocations that were made after extensive studyin the 1984 rate filing and approximated the capacity-energy relationshipof various utilities in and around the Cumberland area. Southeastern andTVA disagreed on the amount of TVA's transmission cost of $5,033,000 thatshould be allocated to customers outside the TVA area. Transmission costthat is included in this rate filing is 165 megawatts at $21.50 per kilowattper year or $3,548,000. Reserve for contingencies included in this filingis approximately 2 percent which increased from approximately 1 percentwhich was included in the 1984 rate filing. TVA has agreed not to commenton these rates.Environmental ImpactSoutheastern has reviewed the possible environmental impacts of the rateadjustment under consideration and has concluded with Departmental concurrencethat, because the increased rates would not significantly affect the qualityof the human environment within the meaning of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969, the proposed action is not a major Federal action forwhich preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is required.Availability of InformationInformation regarding these rate schedules, including studies, and othersupporting materials is available for public review in the offices of SoutheasternPower Administration, Samuel Elbert Building, Elberton, Georgia 30635,and in the Washington Liaison Office, James Forrestal Building, 1000 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.Submission to the Federal Energy Regulatory CommissionThe rates hereinafter confirmed and approved on an interim basis, togetherwith supporting documents, will be submitted promptly to the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission for confirmation and approval on a final basis fora period beginning July 1, 1989, and ending no later than June 30, 1994.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order</ITAG>In view of the foregoing and pursuant to the authority delegated to meby the Secretary of Energy, I hereby confirm and approve on an interimbasis, effective July 1, 1989, attached Wholesale Power Rate SchedulesCBR-1-B, CSI-1-B, CEK-1-B, CC-1-C, CM-1-B, CK-1-B and CTV-1-B.
