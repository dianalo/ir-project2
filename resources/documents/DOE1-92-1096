<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-92-1096 </DOCNO><TEXT>Numerous laboratory simulations and real-world events have demonstratedthe thermal conversion of neat or high concentration PCBs into the muchmore toxic PCDFs; the conversion of concentrated tri and tetrachlorinatedbenzenes (TCBs) into PCDDs and PCDFs is similarly well established. However,as PCB and Askarel-filled transformers are removed from service, thethermal behavior of transformer fluids containing PCBs and/or TCBs at50-5000 ppm becomes of increasing interest. This paper describes thepyrolysis (by heating in an open tube at 550{sup 0}C) and combustion(by injection into a natural-gas-fueled flame) of dilute Aroclor 1254and TCB solutions in mineral oil, silicone oil, and tetrachloroethylene(TCE), and measurement of the resulting yields of PCDD and PCDF. In allexperiments, dilution of PCB or TCB drastically decreased the mass ofPCDF formed per gram of mixture. Alternatively, the yields expressedas mass of PCDF or PCDD per gram of chlorinated precursor exhibited modestbut interesting variations with concentration providing some mechanisticinsight into the formative and destructive processes underway.</TEXT></DOC>
