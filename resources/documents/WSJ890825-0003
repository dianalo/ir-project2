The report, the final research in a 10-year acid rain study that will be released in its final form next year, found that reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide would improve the quality of lakes in the Northeast and that failure to reduce emissions would hurt streams in the South. The study looked at scenarios under which sulfur emissions and acidic deposits increased, decreased and stayed the same.    Environmentalists and others will point to those findings as evidence that sharp cuts in utilities' sulfur emissions would be beneficial. Henry Habicht, deputy EPA administrator said, &quot;The scientific data reinforce President Bush's proposal to reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons.&quot; That proposal is considered the stiffest portion of the president's clean-air legislation, which was released last month.    Industry groups, however, focused on findings that indicated there wouldn't be rapid, significant deterioration if emissions are unchanged. In the South, the number of damaged streams would rise significantly, but only over a 50-year period. In the Northeast, water quality would hardly change.    The National Coal Association continued to insist that it is premature to take action to control acid rain until the final report is out. A spokesman said the latest research supports the group's view that &quot;the acid rain situation is not an ecological emergency that we need to act on today.&quot;    Similarly, the Edison Electric Institute said the report indicates &quot;no environmental crisis exists&quot; and said sulfur emission cuts should be made in &quot;in the most cost-effective manner possible.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
