Kennedy's firstday on the bench.   The four hours of subdued technical arguments in the hushed,crimson-draped courtroom were a sharp contrast to the noisy andpartisan battles that preceded Kennedy's Feb. 3 confirmation by theSenate.   Kennedy looked solemn as he entered the chamber, strode past theAmerican flag, stood before the pale marble columns and took hisseat at the end of the row of nine justices. That seat, on the farright as spectators face the court, is the traditional place forthe high court's newest member.   A slight smile crossed Kennedy's face during a brief exchangewith Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, seated next to him, just beforeChief Justice William Rehnquist opened the session.   The former appellate judge from Sacramento, Calif., a man with areputation for being deliberative and well prepared, didn't say aword until nearly an hour had elapsed. And then he asked only onequestion.   The first argument of the four on Monday's schedule concernedthe state of Mississippi's attempt to undertake its own cost reviewof the Grand Gulf nuclear plant near Vicksburg.   Kennedy listened intently and took notes during the hour oftechnical discussion.   O'Connor and Justice Antonin Scalia, the two most recentadditions to the court before Kennedy, were among the mostaggressive questioners in the first argument.   Kennedy waited until its closing minutes to ask his firstquestion from the bench of the high court.   ``Is it fair to say,'' he asked attorney John Maxey,representing the state of Mississippi, ``that all of the argumentsthat Mississippi wants to present now ... could have been madebefore FERC, even though FERC is being asked to draw a differentconclusion?''   Maxey said no, but Kennedy's question was answered in theaffirmative by Rex Lee, the former solicitor general, todayrepresenting Mississippi Power andamp; Light. ``These matters can andmust be raised before FERC if they are to be raised at all,'' Leesaid.   The next three cases involved railroad worker lawsuits againstemployers, a technicality concerning sex discrimination in statepension benefits and a surgeon suing fellow doctors over antitrustviolations.   Kennedy's presence brought the court to full strength for thefirst time since Justice Lewis F. Powell resigned in June. And itmarked a return to business as usual following months of conflictbetween the administration and the Senate.   The Senate intensely scrutinized and ultimately rejected JudgeRobert H. Bork, the administration's first nominee. Its secondnominee, Judge Douglas H. Ginsberg, withdrew after revelations thathe had used marijuana.   Although a conservative for 12 years on the federal bench,Kennedy is considered more moderate than either Bork or Ginsburg.But little is known about his views on abortion regulation,affirmative action, church-state relations or the other politicallysensitive issues on which the court is closely divided.</TEXT></DOC>
