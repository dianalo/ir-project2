Meanwhile, West German monetary officials said they wouldn't intervene to block a further slight decline in the dollar's value. The remarks by the officials, who didn't want to be identified, tend to support the belief of many currency traders that officials of major industrial nations have lowered the range of dollar exchange rates that they would find acceptable.    One West German official described the dollar's fall in Europe yesterday as &quot;only a slight weakening, within reasonable ranges.&quot; He said, &quot;No one here has much trouble with these levels.&quot;    Traders attributed the dollar's recovery yesterday largely to buying aimed at taking profits on oversold positions. But some said a repatriation of U.S. funds that had been invested in the Tokyo stock market helped push the currency up against the Japanese yen.    Because of falling U.S. interest rates, however, there was little optimism among traders about the dollar's outlook.    &quot;The interest-rate differential is working against the dollar,&quot; Albert Soria, vice president, foreign exchange, for Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said. He was referring to the narrowing of the spread between yields on U.S. and foreign instruments that had favored dollar-denominated investments.    As was the case a week earlier when U.S. stocks suffered a record 22.6% decline, the dollar didn't react negatively yesterday as Wall Street took another pounding. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average was plunging 156.83 points, the dollar was climbing back from its intraday lows reached in European trading.    The dollar's initial fall yesterday was based on an assumption among currency traders that the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain downward pressure on interest rates as long as the economy faces the threat of a collapsing stock market.    &quot;With the stock market sell-off, there's no way the Fed is going to use short-term interest rates to defend the dollar,&quot; Jim O'Neill, financial markets economist in New York for Marine Midland Bank, said.    Lower interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated investments less attractive and to decrease demand for the dollar. There also is significant doubt that the U.S.'s major allies would ease their rates in step with the U.S., meaning that dollar investments' yield advantage would be further threatened.    The Swiss franc benefited most from the early dollar selling yesterday, as investors headed for the Swiss bond market, Mr. Soria of Swiss Bank Corp. said.    &quot;It's strictly a flight to quality; I don't think investors want to go into any stock market right now,&quot; he said.    About midway through the European trading day, the dollar stood at 1.4565 Swiss francs, down 0.9% from 1.4693 late Friday in New York. Against the West German currency, it was at a five-month low of 1.7650 marks, down 0.7% from 1.7780 late Friday.    In late New York trading yesterday, after traders bought the currency to cover short, or oversold, positions, the dollar was quoted at 1.4656 Swiss francs and 1.7775 marks.    The dollar's performance against the yen was a slightly different story and involved more than profit-taking by currency speculators.    The U.S. currency recovered yesterday to stand at 142.50 yen late in the New York day, up 0.5% from 141.73 late Friday. Among those selling yen to buy dollars were U.S. mutual funds repatriating proceeds from sales on the Tokyo stock market, according to Eishi Wakabayashi, head of currency and bond trading at Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru International Inc., the New York unit of a Japanese investment house.    &quot;They think the Tokyo (stock) market is more overvalued than New York's, and there's a sense that they'd rather take their business home,&quot; he said.    The dollar also firmed against the British pound as sterling slipped to $1.6845 from $1.6850. Traders said the Bank of England intervened in European trading to buy dollars against sterling. The central bank declined to comment, but British monetary sources confirmed the purchases.    Traders said they believe the intervention was intended primarily to weaken the pound against the mark. For trade reasons, the sterling-mark relationship is currently more important to British authorities than the dollar rate. For some time, the Bank of England has sought to keep the pound below 3.00 marks. The pound eased yesterday to 2.9942 marks from 2.9959.    The West German Bundesbank bought $22.7 million at the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing yesterday, but this wasn't considered a sizable intervention. There were no reports of West German central bank activity in the open market.    Meanwhile, Banque Nationale de Belgique sold a substantial amount of marks and bought Belgian francs at the Brussels foreign exchange fixing to try to shore up the Belgian currency.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2.80 an ounce to $476.20 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was 4.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $475.85 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    The dollar was quoted at 142.27 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    ---                     Late New York Trading                    Monday, Oct. 26, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
