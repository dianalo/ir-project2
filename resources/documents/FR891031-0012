Eligibility will be determined by the SBA as of the time of submissionof initial offers which include price. Eligibility is based on section8(a) Program criteria, e.g., whether the firm has the SIC code for theacquisition in its approved business plan, whether the firm is currentlya small business under the SIC code, whether the firm is in the developmentalor transitional stage (if the acquisition is restricted by stage), whetherthe firm is in conformance with the 8(a) support limitation set forth inits business plan, and whether the firm is in conformance with its 8(a)business activity targets.(1) In sealed bid acquisitions, upon receipt of offers, the contractingofficer will provide the SBA a copy of the solicitation, the estimatedfair market price, and a list of offerors ranked in the order of theirstanding for award (i.e., first low, second low, etc.) with the total evaluatedprice for each offer, differentiating between basic requirements and anyoptions. The SBA will consider the eligibility of the first low offeror.If the first low offeror is not determined to be eligible, the SBA willconsider the eligibility of the next low offeror until an eligible offeroris identified. The SBA will determine the eligibility of the firms andadvise the contracting officer within 5 working days after its receiptof the list of bidders. Once eligibility has been established by the SBA,the successful offeror will be determined by the contracting activity inaccordance with normal contracting procedures.(2) In negotiated acquisition, the SBA will determine eligibility whenthe successful offeror has been established by the agency and the contracttransmitted for signature unless a referral has been made under 19.809,in which case the SBA will determine eligibility at that point.(d) In any case in which a firm is determined to be ineligible, the SBAwill notify the firm of that determination.(e) The eligibility of an 8(a) firm for a competitive 8(a) award may notbe challenged or protested by another 8(a) firm or any other party as partof a solicitation or proposed contract award.
