South Korean businessmen are pouring into Iraq's capital inhopes of winning orders for major construction projects. Japan isalso expected to be active in seeking business.   At a recent Baghdad trade fair, 26 U.S. companies had displaystands. And several Western European companies are already at workon major construction projects.   Peace negotiations aimed at ending the fighting between Iraq andIran open in Geneva on Thursday, five days after a U.N.-sponsoredtruce took effect in the 8-year-old conflict.   ``The South Koreans have been showing vigor and determination tohave the lion's share in Iraq's reconstruction effort,'' said adiplomat in Baghdad, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Iraqi officials have said that they would look favorably oncompanies and countries that maintained business with Iraq duringthe Gulf war, and which agreed to defer payments and rescheduledebts.   ``The Koreans have maintained business with Iraq during the hardtimes, and deferred major loans until the war came to an end. Theyexpect the Iraqis to reward them for their loyalty,'' he said.   Several Western European companies have also continued to dobusiness with Iraq.   Britain's Paterson Candy International is helping build a $1billion irrigation project west of Baghdad, and a WestGerman-Italian consortium is building the $1.7 billion Saddam damon the Euphrates River. Italy's Saipem group has won a $1.4 billioncontract to build an oil pipeline from Iraq across Saudi Arabia.   When the war started, Iraq was investing its billions of oildollars in an ambitious development plan that included steel,petrochemical, fertilizer and automobile plants and massive water,road and housing projects.   Iraq has refused to provide figures on its losses in the war,either human or economic. But foreign estimates put the cost ofjust rebuilding the country's war-damaged transport facilities, oilinstallations, housing, factories, schools and hospitals at $30billion.   Damage to oil installations alone from Iranian bombing andshelling attacks has amounted to $8 billion, according to anestimate by Kiyotaki Tsuji of the Japanese Institute of Middle EastEconomic Studies.   Steel and oil giant USX Corp. plans to sell an idle steel plantin Baytown, Texas, to Iraq, which wants to dismantle the plant andship it home to build pipes for irrigation and oil production. Iraqreportedly has offered Pittsburgh-based USX $100 million for theplant, but some Texas congressmen oppose the sale.   In recent years, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has changed someof his economic policies, pushing privatization rather than thesocialist central planning and government control that prevailedbefore the war.   Last week, for example, the Iraqi government said the country'sseven major hotels, its biggest restaurants and other touristfacilities will be sold off or leased to the private sector.   South Korean companies were the primary contractors for many ofIraq's suspended projects, including power plants, oil refineries,highways, pipelines and ports. Immediately after Iraq and Iranagreed to a cease-fire, South Korea's major construction companieshastily dispatched their chief executives to Baghdad.   One ghost from the war hanging around the reconstruction banquetis Iraq's foreign debt, estimated at $60 billion.   But since Iraq has oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia's,foreign businessmen seem ready to overlook this.   Diplomats said they expect the Iraqis to continue to defer someof their debts by seeking new credits as they repay old ones.France, West Germany, Italy and Japan have already rescheduledbillions of dollars in loans to Iraq.   France, Iraq's second-largest arms supplier after the SovietUnion, has extended about $5 billion in credit for weaponspurchases.   A South Korean businessman expressed confidence in Iraq'spostwar economy.   ``Assuming oil prices hold steady, revenues from oil areprojected to reach around $14 billion this year,'' he said,speaking on condition he not be identified.   ``Looking further ahead, the country's revenues could be $20billion in early 1990,'' he said.   Some Japanese companies have begun lobbying for major post-warcontracts, raising the prospect of tough competition between thetwo Asian powers at the same time that Western European and U.S.companies are becoming more active in the Iraqi contest.   The South Korean companies left their offices in Iraq openduring the war and kept their equipment in the country, hoping toreturn and do business there.   ``We have always been able to distinguish between wartime Iraq... and Iraq of the next century, with its great economicpotential,'' the South Korean businessman said.   U.S. companies are seeking a big slice of Iraq's reconstructionpie. The Reagan administration restored financing to Iraq from theExport-Import Bank last year, after withdrawing it when Baghdadstopped debt repayments.   U.S.-Iraqi trade, estimated last year at more than $700 million,also is expected to swell in the wake of the cease-fire.</TEXT></DOC>
