The new design would make it possible for the companies to buildpersonal computers that rival IBM's 1{-year-old Personal System-2line without departing so far from the older standard, analystssaid Tuesday.   Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston is leading the challenge, whichmay eventually include as many as 30 companies that make personalcomputers or related products, said Jim Weil, an analyst forGartner Securities Corp.   Calling the news conference for Tuesday in New York are Compaq,Japanese-owned Epson America and NEC Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.,NEC Corp., Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti, Tandy Corp., Wyse Technologyand Zenith Data Systems.   The joint project could put additional competitive pressure onIBM, but it might also help IBM by serving as an acknowledgementthat its new Personal System-2 line has features that are worthduplicating, Weil said.   IBM could benefit if the delay in bringing the new computers tomarket gives IBM a chance to get its line better established, saidGeorge Colony, president of Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge,Mass.   Colony said he thought creating a new standard was a bad ideabecause, ``There would be further confusion on the part of theusers, and that would translate into slower sales.''   The new standard is for a ``bus,'' something which controls theway information flows through a computer. The more advanced modelsof IBM's Personal System-2 line use a new bus called Micro Channel.IBM's rivals use the older bus that was used in IBM's PC AT.   Weil said IBM's rivals will claim that their new bus offers allthe power of IBM's Micro Channel but allows people to continueusing their older add-on equipment, such as circuit cards. IBM'sMicro Channel requires users to buy all new add-on equipment.   Compaq declined comment on the reports. Weil said that inaddition to the companies calling the news conference, Intel Corp.and Microsoft Corp. have played a role in developing the newstandard.
