 This new kid on the block is Odyssey Development's Isysversion 2.05 (available for $395 direct from Odyssey's Burbank, California,office).andP;  Unlike some text search programs, which require a PhD in computerjargon, Isys's excellent menu system, on-line help, and clearly writtenmanual make it a joy for power users and novices alike.andM;Indexing a database with Isys is simplicity itself:  Just use the &quot;Selectanother directory&quot; command from the main menu to tell Isys where the databaseis, then choose &quot;Documents&quot; from the configuration option menu.andP;  (The F1 keyaccesses a help screen, which lists your options for each command.)andP;  Finally,select &quot;Create&quot; from the updates and utilities menu, and Isys indexes thedocuments.andM;Users comfortable with Isys's own search codes can bypass the search creationmenu by selecting &quot;Command-based searchers.&quot;andP;  This is the only way to performcertain kinds of extremely elaborate searches.andP;  But menu-driven searches willmore than meet many users' needs.andP;  Say, for example, you want to find everytime &quot;software&quot; appears in the same paragraph as &quot;computer.&quot;andP;  First type in&quot;software.&quot;andP;  Then select the &quot;In the same PARAGRAPH as.andP;  .  .&quot; option fromthe search option menu, and type in &quot;computer.&quot;andP;  To initiate the search,select &quot;That's it, no more conditions&quot; from the menu.andM;Isys makes it easy to locate flagged passages with your word processor'sgo-to-line command:  Its single-spaced text displays retain the original'sline numbering.andP;  If the line is longer than 79 characters, the extracharacters are displayed on a second, usually much shorter line.andP;  Isys alsolets you jump directly into your word processor to edit the displayed portionof the file.andP;  Or you can run Isys as a TSR and call it up from within yourword processor.andP;  In addition, Isys runs well under Windows 3.0 in full-screenand windowed mode.andM;In many crucial respects, version 2.05 of Isys is far more flexible andpowerful than ZyIndex for DOS, long considered the most powerful (and mostdifficult to use) of DOS-based text retrieval software.andP;  Isys's speed andindexing capacity, for example, blow XyIndex 3.1B out of the water.andP;  Isyszipped through a 7.3MB ASCII database containing 841,000 words in 21 minutesflat on my 25MHz 486 computer; ZyIndex for DOS took 32 minutes to index thesame database.andP;  ZyIndex's current database limits (15,000 files per index, nofile larger than 600K) pale in comparison to Isys's ability to indextwo-billion-word-long databases containing either a single-gigaword file orup to a million separate files.andM;Isys supports almost every conceivable type of word processor format, as wellas DCA, FFT, and RFT conversion formats; plain ASCII; dBase III memo fields;and word processing files containing Ventura Publisher formatting codes.andP;  Innotable contrast to the DOS and Windows versions of ZyIndex, it successfullyindexes all the information in Word for Windows files saved in Word's defaultQUICK SAVE format.andP;  This is no small matter: Changing Word's default meansrewriting its FILESAVE macro; worse yet, files saved in the QUICK SAVE formatmust be opened one by one and laboriously resaved in the Word format thatZyIndex can read.andM;ZyIndex's strong suit has historically been its wide range of search options.andO;But here, too, Isys more than holds its own.andP;  Both programs let you searchfor every word beginning with &quot;post&quot;.andP;  Only Isys can also restrict the searchto words with related meanings, such as &quot;posted,&quot; &quot;posts,&quot; and &quot;posting,&quot; butnot &quot;postgraduate&quot; and &quot;postpone.&quot;andP;  Isys provides more proximity searchoptions as well, even letting you specify the order of search terms.andM;Even so, ZyIndex still has a few tricks up its sleeve.andP;  Isys lets you definesynonyms for search terms, but lacks a built-in thesaurus; ZyIndex provides ahelpful thesaurus that you can customize.andP;  Moreover, unlike Isys, ZyIndexoffers a gaggle of sophisticated options for automating index creation withcommand-line parameters.andM;Still, unless you need one of ZyIndex's special features, the choice isclear.andP;  Isys is faster, it indexes much larger databases, and it's far easierto use.andP;  From now on, Isys is the program to beat.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
