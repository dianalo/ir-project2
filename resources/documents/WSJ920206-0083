In a letter delivered yesterday to Merc Chairman John F.Sandner, Sens. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), agriculture committeechairman, and Richard G. Lugar (R., Ind.) said restoring dualtrading at the Merc would be &quot;a serious step backward.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The Merc last May banned dual trading, which allows floorbrokers to fill orders for customers while simultaneouslytrading for their own accounts. Critics argue the practiceplaces the interests of brokers in conflict with those oftheir customers. In hectic futures pits, where prices canrise or fall sharply in seconds, brokers are likely tocomplete their own trades at the best prices and worry aboutcustomer orders later, these critics say.   The Merc's dual trading ban wasn't matched by its largerrival across town, the Chicago Board of Trade. Since then,Merc floor brokers have complained that the ban penalizesthem and damps liquidity of the Merc's contracts.   Recently, powerful associations of Merc floor brokersbegan writing letters to Mr. Sandner, asking that he considerlifting the ban. At its regular meeting yesterday, theexchange's board of governors had been expected to considerholding a referendum to allow exchange members -- floorbrokers and other traders -- to vote on the issue.   But a Merc official said the senators' letter gave theboard an excuse to put off scheduling a member vote. &quot;Thisissue has become so divisive and so heated, the board waslooking for a way to postpone it,&quot; said the official, whorequested anonymity.   Floor brokers, though influential in exchange politics,are actually fewer on the exchange floor than so-called localtraders, who buy and sell only for their own accounts. Andmost local traders oppose restoring dual trading because,they say, it gives brokers an unfair advantage in the pits.   &quot;It doesn't look good for us,&quot; said John D. Newhouse, abroker in the Merc's Eurodollar pit who recently wrote aletter on behalf of 100 other brokers urging Mr. Sandner tolift the ban. &quot;We were hoping the board would schedule areferendum.&quot;   In their letter, Sens. Leahy and Lugar hinted they mightview the dual-trading issue differently once the exchange's&quot;audit&quot; electronic trading-card system is in place a year ortwo from now. This system is expected to create an electronicrecord of the time and price of every futures trade, makingit easier for the exchange to detect abuses.</TEXT></DOC>
