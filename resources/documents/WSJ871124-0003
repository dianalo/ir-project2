Scores of corporations tried to bolster their stock prices after the market crash with big buy-back programs, yet executives or directors of a few of these companies were selling their own shares at the same time.    Companies involved include General Motors, Merrill Lynch, Monsanto and W.A. Krueger.    There's no question of illegality or impropriety. But the sales by the insiders might undercut somewhat the companies' assertions that their shares were undervalued, even though each individual may have had compelling personal reasons for the sales.    The sales data come from Invest/Net Inc. of North Miami, Fla., which culled Securities and Exchange Commission filings in the two weeks ended last Tuesday by officers, directors and large stockholders who have to disclose their sales and purchases.    These sales run counter to an overall trend of insider buying since the crash, according to Edwin Buck, editor of Vickers Weekly Insider Report in Brookside, N.J. Mr. Buck says insider buying has been &quot;fantastic. I've never seen anything like it.&quot; He says insider sellers normally outnumber buyers by 2.5 to 1, but lately buyers have outnumbered sellers by 11-1.    Among the companies flagged by Invest/Net, Merrill Lynch announced on Oct. 20 that its board authorized buying back an additional five million shares. Merrill also &quot;reaffirmed to its customers and investors the strength of its capital and liquidity.&quot;    Merrill stock, which peaked at 46 3/4 in February, fell 9 5/8 on Black Monday to close at 24 1/4. In the two days following the buy-back announcement, the price rose to 29 3/8 before settling into the mid-20s a few days later. Yesterday, the stock closed at 22.    According to Invest/Net, Merrill Vice President David Lefeve sold 7,000 shares at 23 3/4 Oct. 28, leaving him with total direct and indirect ownership of 23,231 shares. Mr. Lefeve is Merrill's Washington-based director of state and local government relations.    Reached late yesterday at his home, Mr. Lefeve confirmed the sale and explained, &quot;Anyone who sells stock at 23 with a book value of 29 is either a darn fool or got a margin call.&quot; In Mr. Lefeve's case, he got a margin call.    &quot;People will often sell for individual reasons not related at all to what's happening at the company,&quot; observed Charles Plohn Jr., head of special equity transactions for Merrill. Mr. Plohn's job includes executing buy-backs for other companies. Executives often have &quot;a high percentage of their liquid net worth in their corporation's stock,&quot; Mr. Plohn said. &quot;To the extent they need cash for tax payments or to buy a house, when they want to raise money it's not unusual that they would go to their most liquid asset,&quot; he added.    The Merrill executive said some companies seek to avoid buying back stock while management or other large shareholders are selling. But he said one should consider the transaction in question compared with the stock's total volume that day. Some 569,800 shares traded the day of Mr. Lefeve's sale.    At General Motors, according to Invest/Net, after a buy-back announcement Oct. 20, Treasurer Leon Krain sold 526 shares at an average of $58.41 Oct. 28. That left him with direct and indirect holdings of 1,948 shares.    (Another GM officer, Buick division General Manager Edward Mertz, sold 3,439 shares at $65.38 on Oct. 19, leaving him with 4,153 shares. Another executive, Claude Moore, exercised an option to buy 1,532 shares Oct. 7 at $78.94, bringing his holdings to 13,666 shares.)    GM, whose stock fell by 6 to 60 on Oct. 19, accelerated an existing purchase program the next day. Since then, the price has fluctuated around 60 and a bit below. &quot;The only thing I can think of is they must have some need for the money,&quot; said GM spokesman William Winters. &quot;My personal opinion is there wouldn't be any relationship between the repurchase plan and their selling stock.&quot;    At Monsanto, Robert Potter, chemical unit president, sold 700 shares at 65 Oct. 29, leaving him with 2,987 shares. That was six days after Monsanto said it had finished a three-million-share buy-back launched in January and announced another one for five million shares.    &quot;I'm not going to comment on why Bob Potter sold shares,&quot; said Nick Filippello, Monsanto's director of financial communications.    At W.A. Krueger, a printing company, Vice President Margaret Willoughby sold 12,500 shares, leaving her with 139,639, Oct. 27 and 28, the two days after Krueger announced a buy-back Oct. 26. Krueger executives didn't return phone calls seeking comment.    &quot;In my own mind I would say a guy has a perfect right, especially in this crazy market, to preserve his capital. He's got responsibilities to himself and his family just like all the rest of us,&quot; Mr. Buck said of the sales.    Securities lawyer Harvey Pitt of Fried Frank Harris Shriver andamp; Jacobson says companies that execute buy-backs try to avoid having an impact on the day-to-day market price by avoiding certain types of buying, such as at the opening or close of the trading day.    &quot;Obviously an individual who was responsible for the buy-back could find himself on both sides of the same issue,&quot; said Mr. Pitt. But the insiders may have &quot;margin calls or root canal work or whatever&quot; that necessitate an equally painful sale. </TEXT></DOC>
