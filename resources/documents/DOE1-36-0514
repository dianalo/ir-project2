The phlogistic septic or aseptic reaction to thepresence of a foreign body produces nonspecific symptoms and may varyaccording to the site of the lesions and its relationship with contiguousviscera. Plain abdomen films and the barium meal give some information(mainly topographic), but are usually insufficent for correct diagnosis.As proved by the three case reports discussed, US images (strongly attenuatingmass with intense acoustic shadows in a fluid collection) and especiallythe CT images (mass containing a striped, spotted and whirlike pattern)may be highly indicative, permitting correct preoperative diagnosis.</TEXT></DOC>
