Yet it is the international pressures on South Africa that have brought the group together. Economic sanctions have soured the country's sugar industry, and these farmers have come here to wrestle with the consequences. &quot;Without sugar cane, we have no jobs, no money,&quot; says Olly Sibiya, one of the growers. &quot;Without sugar cane, we are starving.&quot;    On the surface, the international sanctions drive, which picked up steam a year ago today when the U.S. Congress passed an array of penalties, seems to have landed at most a glancing blow. The white government, which was supposed to be prodded into reform, remains unbowed. The economy, fueled by the lofty price of gold -- the country's most valuable export, which is barely touched by the sanctions -- is still growing.    In Washington, meantime, the Reagan administration expressed its opposition to sanctions and said it is seeking &quot;other ways&quot; to prod Pretoria toward dismantling apartheid. &quot;{Sanctions} haven't resulted in significant progress in ending the outrage of apartheid,&quot; White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday. The administration is required under the sanctions law to submit a report to Congress this week on conditions in South Africa. If progress hasn't been made toward ending apartheid, Mr. Reagan is supposed to recommend additional sanctions. But the administration is expected, instead, to restate its opposition to sanction.    But here in remote Entumeni, on the vulnerable underside of the economy, there is no mistaking the hardship the sanctions have inflicted. And to some, the farmers' plight serves as a warning of the fate that lies ahead for the entire nation if shrinking foreign markets choke off economic growth and throw masses of people out of work.    &quot;Sanctions are never healthy,&quot; says Rex Hudson, the general manager of the South African Cane Growers' Association. &quot;It is like a slow bleeding to death.&quot;    Each of 18 men and women gathered in the courthouse has about 2 1/2 acres of cane, and each is desperate to expand. But sanctions, particularly moves by the U.S. and Canada to block imports of South African sugar, have stunted the sugar industry's growth. The South African Sugar Association, which regulates cane production along with the government, has stopped handing out new quotas to farmers. So 2 1/2 acres apiece will have to do.    Lacking a sophisticated understanding of the political pros and cons of the sanctions, the farmers talk instead about the uncertainty that the meaures have brought to their lives. &quot;We're the ones who feel the sanctions,&quot; says Mr. Sibiya. &quot;What kind of future do we have if we can't expand? There is a lot of worry and confusion in this room.&quot;    Adds Geoffrey Bhengu, a farmer up the road in the town of Eshowe: &quot;We are like people who know they are moving toward a precipice but can't stop because they have no choice. It is a prolonged tension.&quot;    In South Africa, the first to feel the effects are those on the bottom of the economic scale -- the blacks. Industries hardest hit by sanctions -- coal mining, textiles, agriculture -- have already begun retrenchment programs, and most of those turned out of jobs are black.    Yet the nation as a whole still sells more to the world than it buys. The trade surplus has led some businessmen and government officials to adopt an air of invincibility. But others fear it won't be long before the effects of the sanctions creep higher -- to the whites.    &quot;Most of us know it can't go on like this,&quot; says the manager of an export-import company, bemoaning the restricted access to the markets of North America, Western Europe and Japan. &quot;It hurts to see your goods go to the East bloc or the Third World. We need the exposure to the latest technology. We can't pretend not to feel the effect of sanctions.&quot;    There is no pretending in Entumeni. The sugar sanctions have touched off a chain reaction -- first hitting the industry as a whole, then rocking the small growers of KwaZulu, which is the government's designated homeland for members of the Zulu tribe, and finally jeopardizing the smallest mill in the country.    When the U.S. sanctions came into effect, one of the first casualties was South Africa's U.S. sugar quota of about 40,000 tons a year. Canada followed by eliminating its allotment of 120,000 tons. Suddenly, the South African industry, already reeling from the depressed world price, had lost about 20% of its export market.    Although industry officials say they have found other buyers to take up the slack -- they won't say which ones -- any hopes for expansion were dashed. The U.S. cutoff hurt more because prices there are set artificially high to protect American farmers -- a policy that gave South Africa a $7 million-a-year premium.    Before sanctions hit, the sugar association was making plans to divert this money to aiding the black growers. &quot;Of course, that fell through when we lost the market,&quot; says Peter Sale, general manager of the sugar association.    This loss is being felt most acutely in KwaZulu, where sugar cane is the largest source of income. Since 1973, when the association began a financial-assistance program for them, the number of black cane growers has more than quadrupled to about 21,000. And they all had big plans. &quot;When we got into cane growing, we came to stay,&quot; says Mr. Sibiya. &quot;We don't have an option of getting out now like the white farmers.&quot;    The 2,000 white growers, who raise most of the country's cane, are better able to adjust to market fluctuations, either by planting other crops or by selling their land. The black farmers don't have this option, because they don't own the land; it is held by the local chief in trust from the central government.    But they may be forced out if the Entumeni sugar mill, the smallest in the country and the only one in the immediate area, shuts down. Already foundering before sanctions came along, the mill was counting on the expansion by the black growers to restore it to health. Now, it is fighting to stay open.    &quot;I wouldn't put it out of the question that if the economics of the industry continue as they are, this mill won't be viable anymore,&quot; says Rob Pole, the manager. &quot;Being the smallest, we're certainly feeling the threat from sanctions. The small guys are always the ones who feel it most.&quot;    Mr. Bhengu, who is also the deputy minister of education in the KwaZulu government, says 1,300 growers, including himself, would go under along with the mill. The precipice, he fears, is getting nearer. &quot;If the mill goes, we have no future as growers,&quot; he says. &quot;Then, I fear for the stability of an area that has had peace for the past 100 years.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
