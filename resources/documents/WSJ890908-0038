Frequent-flier plans generally credit travelers with a minimum of one point for each mile.    Air Canada and PWA Corp. said the half-point credits will apply from Feb. 1 to travelers who pay less than the full economy fare for flights within Canada.    Discount fares to points outside Canada still will be credited with one point a mile. Both companies will reduce credits for full-fare economy flights to one point from 1.25 points a mile. The companies have differing plans to revise the points credited to other classes of fares.    Randy Petersen, editor and publisher of Frequent, a frequent-flier magazine in Colorado Springs, Colo., said he didn't know of any other programs that offer less than one point a mile. He predicted that the Canadian innovation would &quot;never, never, never&quot; spread to the U.S. because of greater airline competition there.    Blair Baldwin, manager of PWA's frequent-flier plan, said the new point structure better reflects the fares paid by passengers. He said it also would moderate the growth of accumulated frequent-flier points, which had been &quot;skyrocketing.&quot;    Canadian carriers offered as much as six points a mile last year during a three-cornered price war that concluded with PWA's acquisition of Wardair Inc. PWA also owns Canadian Airlines International. </TEXT></DOC>
