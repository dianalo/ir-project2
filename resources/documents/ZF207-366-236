 There were no new developments on the Quadex front.andM;The 420 XL.andP;  The printer, called the CG 420XL, runs off the Genics RIP thatdrives the 9400, 9600 and 9700 imaging engines in CG slve mode.andP;  The printengine is a standard Canon LBP-20.andP;  (Readers may recall that Compugraphicstarted separating its recorders from its RIPS last fall when it introducedthe 9400 with its ability to support a PostScript RIP as well as aCG-language Genics one.)andM;Features include 11 X 17-inch pages at a speed of 10 pages per minute (or 20ppm on letter-size sheets) and a resolution of 400 dots per inch.andM;Jobs can be sent by command to either the 420XL or one of the high-resolutionimagesetters.andM;The 420XL is priced at $ 21,495, including the printer and interface.andP;  Firstdeliveries are scheduled for June.andP;  The Genics RIP sells for $ 17,995separately or can be bundled with a high-resolution recorder.andM;Integrator graphics system.andP;  The original Integrator system provided adrawing program developed for Compugraphic by Island Graphics and itsupported the CG Scanner 2000, but it didn't have a paint program for editingscanned graphics, and it didn't support a low-cost line-art scanner.andP;  Thoseshortcomings have been fixed.andM;The latest addition to the Integrator line is a paint program that is beingsold as part of a graphics system that uses the Agfa Focus scanner.andP;  Thepaint program, done by Island Graphics, was introduced at Type-X in aninitial version that isn't as well integrated into the composition system asit should be later, but that nonetheless provides useful functionality.andM;The Focus flatbed scanner operates at resolutions from 100 dpi to 600 dpi.andO;It scans originals up to 8.5&quot; X 11.7&quot;.andM;With the initial release, the paint program is run separately fromcomposition, requiring the user to exit one before entering the other.andP;  Laterwe expect them to run side by side, as the draw program now does.andP;  Anotherfeature not yet available is the ability to send graphics from the paint ordraw programs across the network.andM;The paint program, which has a slightly different screen display than thedraw program because it was designed to be used only with a 19-inch monitor,offers most of the normal paint functions--pixel editing by zooming thedisplay to as much as 16 times actual size, cropping and scaling (althoughinitially these are somewhat inconvenient), making objects transparent oropaque, filing enclosed areas with any of 30 patterns, manipulation ofelements (copy, move, flip, etc.), freehand tracing, and merging graphics ona page of text.andM;Graphics are placed on a page through the facilities of the PowerPropagination program.andP;  The operator specifies the location visually with themouse or keyboard, or by typing coordinate positions into a dialog box.andP;  Itis possible to scale the graphic proportionally or anamorphically as it isimported, but not after it is placed on a page (although this should be addedlater).andP;  Thus, to move or scale a graphic after it has been placed on thepage requires a new command to bring it in.andM;Rotation isn't available on the page, but it can be accomplished within thepaint program before the graphic is merged on the page.andM;Alphatype joins PostScript clubandM;Type-X marked the first public showing of Alphatype's long-awaited PostScriptversion of the Alphacomposer.andP;  Alphatype uses Pipeline Associates' PS Clonesoftware to drive its 5300-dpi CRT-based imagesetter at 1150 dpi forPostScript files.andM;This version of PS Clone runs on a separate NS32532 processor (rated at 8MIPS) with 4 MB of memory.andP;  (The  Alpha-composer itself uses an 80286controller for native-mode operation.)andP;  It uses Alphatype's existing fontlibrary; customers who already have Alphatype fonts can convert them with asmall utility program, so they won't have to buy fonts all over again.andO;Alphatype also provides Adobe-compatible fonts from URW, with 35 availablenow and more to be added.andM;Equipped with an 85-MB disk, 35 Adobe-compatible fonts and the PS Clonecontroller, the Alphacomposer will cost $38,600.andP;  To this, you can add anumber of options:andM;* 300-MB disk for $3,400.andM;* MultiVu preview screen for $7,500; the screen is capable of 150-dpiresolution, enough to do a fair job of showing the effects of kerning.andM;* 3-1/2&quot; floppy drive for $800.andM;It is important to note that the Alphacomposer does not deliver a full 5300dpi across the board.andP;  That is the resolution for native-mode text (the sameas it has been all along).andP;  For PostScript text and graphics, it is currentlyrendering at 1024 vertically by 1300 horizontally.andP;  Alphatype plans toincrease the resolution in the future.andM;There will, of course, be a speed penalty for the increased resolution, sothere will be some way to select between high and low.andP;  Although we haven'thad an opportunity to run a speed test, Alphatype is quoting a speedcurrently of 10 minutes per page, including processing and imaging.andM;Network update.andP;  Last year, Alphatype was selling the Alphacomposer with onlya relatively low-performance network, Tops.andP;  Tops has some advantages,especially in very small networks: it costs little, and it uses a peerarchitecture, meaning that any disk in any workstation can be shared over thenet.andP;  This year, Alphatype is adding support for Novell Netware.andP;  Netwareuses a central file server, can support several wiring schemes (Token Ring,Ethernet, Arcnet) and provides a variety of network management tools andservices like automatic file locking.andM;Alphatype supports fonts that are stored on the Novell file server.andP;  Thisallows you to buy a typesetter with only a small font disk, then send thefonts to the typesetter along with each job.andP;  The same fonts can be sharedwith the MultiVu preview.andM;Futures.andP;  Alphatype expects to offer a field upgrade to its 9900 typesetterin the near future, giving it a faster controller.andP;  The new controller willbe based on a 16-MHz 80386 processor, which should tripe or quadruple themachine's speed.andP;  The upgrade will cost $12,700--or for even more speed, youwill be able to get a 25-MHz version for $15,700.andP;  The upgraded typesetterwill then be renamed the 99000.andP;  Once upgraded, the 99000 can also be fittedwith the Pipeline PS Clone controller.andM;Farther along, Alphatype intends to support printing the MultiVu screen outto a dot-matrix printer.andP;  The printer will be run at 180 X 360-dpiresolution, and the MultiVu software will perform anti-aliasing on the150-dpi bit maps from the screen.andP;  Alphatype is also working on a way toprint the screen to a fax machine, which opens some possibilities for remotepage previewing at a customer's site.andM;Logo scanning from AutologicandM;In addition to demonstrating its new output products (a PostScript RIP forthe APS-6 and its Graphics Integrator), which we covered at the SeyboldSeminars and at America East, Autologic showed enhancements to theMicrocomposer system and a high-end logo scanning system for its APS outputdevices.andM;Microcomposer.andP;  Release 5.0 of Microcomposer software adds the ability tosupport a second window (like a split screen), which will display a secondfile, a directory or a preview of the file that is displayed in the firstwindow.andM;The split is horizontal.andP;  If a directory is displayed in one window, theproportion for each window is fixed.andP;  But if a file is displayed in one and apreview in the other, the percentage allocated for each can be adjusted.andP;  Thepreview is still static.andP;  That is, if one window contains a preview, the textportion can be modified and a new preview generated; the preview isn'tupdated as text is edited.andM;If two files are displayed, it is possible to copy text from one to theother.andM;The windowing feature requires an additional 1 MB of memory in the masterunit on the system (not in each workstation), for a total of 2 MB.andM;Another new item in 5.0 is easier access to commands used in generatingthings like graphics within the GICL language.andP;  Some of the commands that hadto be handled as complicated direct-output commands are now supported ineasy, logical strings.andP;  These include functions to draw ellipses and circles,commands to copy rectangular areas, and so on.andP;  Help screens are available toshow the command syntax.andM;A final addition is an unattended mode for the system's backgroundcommunications capability.andP;  It supports one or two modems at a time.andP;  Theuser sets up the parameters (baud rate, parity, etc.) in advance.andP;  It ispossible also to have  incoming jobs go through automatic code translation.andO;A &quot;user profile&quot; can be set up and accessed as needed.andM;Logo scanner.andP;  Autologic has been using internally a sophisticated logoscanning system based on a DEC Vaxstation II/GPX and a Xerox 7650 scanner.andO;Although it hasn't been selling these systems actively, it has installed themat several sites, including one in the Far East, where it is being used forcreating Kanji fonts; one at a U.S.andP;  newspaper group, for scanning logos forits papers; and one at a U.S.andP;  check printer.andM;The company has now decided to market the system formally.andP;  Called theAutologic Digitizing Center, it includes scanning and editing software, partof which was developed by URW.andP;  Designed to support Autologic machines, itenables one scanning step to create multiple masters to cover the variousranges supported on APS typesetters.andP;  It contains good features (using thekeyboard or mouse) for specifying or modifying the side bearings and baseposition of a character to provide the appropriate fit when the character isoutput.andM;The editing features are quite nice also, working on individual pixels or&quot;areas&quot; defined as contiguous pixels.andP;  The operator can select one area andcause any other area equal to or smaller than the selected one to be filledin.andM;The data in any horizontal or vertical line can be copied to produce theeffect of stretching that part of a logo.andP;  Or a logo can be split at anypoint to have lines inserted.andM;The program includes the usual grid and guides for alignment; zooming to theappropriate enlargement factor; rotation; etc.andM;An &quot;outline&quot; feature enables the operator to view the outline of an editedlogo, showing the points on a curve that makes up the logo.andP;  The outline thencan be overlaid on the original scanned image to ascertain whether or not theedited version is true to the original.andM;Contour and smoothing programs provide user-definable degrees of automaticadjustment in curves.andM;Elements can be moved in one-point, ten-point or hundred-point increments.andM;An &quot;undo&quot; feature removes any editing that has occurred since the last timethe logo was saved.andM;The ability to create data freestyle or from polygons was recently added.andM;Data manipulation facilities include the ability to merge part of one fileinto another one and the ability to store part of a logo for later use withinanother logo.andM;Created logos can be dumped directly to an Autologic Page Image Processor forstorage or can be stored on a floppy disk for use on a Micro-5 typesetter.andM;How much does it cost to get this degree of functionality in an APS world?andO;It isn't cheap.andP;  The Autologic Digitizing Center, including the Xerox 7650,the Vaxstation and software, costs $102,500.andP;  The optional ability to outputto a floppy disk for the Microcomposer adds $12,500.andM;Bedford takes shape on a MacandM;Bedford is in the process of completing the Macintosh version of itstypesetting system, called ProType.andP;  This runs under A/UX (Apple's version ofUnix), not the ordinary Mac operating system.andP;  It requires a Mac II with aSuperMac monitor and 4 MB of memory (and it can use 8 MB to good advantage).andM;Bedford's initial software port to the Macintosh, shown in the fall, provideda user interface suitable for the professional typographer but not in keepingwith other Macintosh programs.andP;  Most functions were invoked by keyboardcoding.andP;  By Type-X, however, the interface had evolved dramatically.andO;Functions are accessible via pulldown menus using the mouse in normalMacintosh fashion, and anyone familiar with the Macintosh would be able toperform the basic operations with minimal instruction.andM;Most functions were accessible from menus in time for Type-X.andP;  The balancecould be invoked, but only from the keyboard.) Bedford should soon have allfunctions available from menus.andM;Some functions are easier on the Mac than on the traditional Bedford screen.andO;For example, tint and pattern fills use the Macintosh paint-bucket tool,which is simpler than the multiple-step process previously used.andM;The system supports the rotation of blocks of text to any angle, and therotated text can still be edited normally.andM;Among the functions not yet implemented on the Mac are the flowing of galleysinto page areas and the linking of areas together, so that text flows fromone to the next.andM;Bedford keeps up its display speed by letting the user work with stick-figurefonts and low-res graphics during page creation and modification.andP;  To see amore accurate representation of the page, the user can choose rendered fontsand  higher-resolution graphics, but the screen-painting process is sloweddramatically.andM;Using A/UX instead of the Mac OS probably made Bedford's software porteasier, and it has an important user benefit as well.andP;  Bedford takesadvantage of the multitasking feature of A/UX to run some functions asbackground tasks.andP;  Normal editing and composition functions can continue inthe foreground while these tasks are running.andP;  Incidentally, Bedford believesit was the first Unix developer for the Mac.andM;Bedford can handle Japanese and Hebrew as well as various Roman-alphabetlanguages, and the prompts and menus can be displayed in those languages aswell.andM;Graphics.andP;  Bedford has been hard at work developing graphic capabilities forthe Macintosh product.andP;  For high-end applications, Bedford supports the ECRMAutokon with the SCSI buffer option.andP;  The company has now added to this theability to import TIFF files from other Mac applications.andP;  To do this,Bedford had to write a Mac OS-to-A/UX conversion program (since all theTIFF-producing software packages and scanners create Mac OS files).andP;  Bedfordspecifically mentioned the Truvel scanner as a possible TIFF source; Bedfordis considering offering the Truvel device as an option.andP;  EncapsulatedPostScript files can also be imported.andM;Desktop software conversions.andP;  Bedford has developed a mechanism forimporting text files created in PageMaker, Ventura Publisher, Quark Xpress,and ReadySetGo.andP;  This software carries the misleading name of &quot;PostScriptText Translator&quot;; actually, PostScript is not involved.andM;The software brings in text, rules and page geometry from the four desktoppackages and places it into Bedford pages.andP;  At this point, the text and rulescan be output, or they can be manipulated as if they had been created on theBedford system.andP;  Images, if present on the page, are not imported; they haveto be brought in separately as individual TIFF or EPS files and placed on thepage within the Bedford environment.andM;The philosophy behind the conversion software is that a Bedford customer cantake in desktop publishing files and refine them, perhaps adding kerning orfonts that the desktop user doesn't have, and output them on ahigh-resolution typesetter.andM;The completed Macintosh package is expected to be ready for customer shipmentin July.andP;  The basic ProType composition software with English hyphenationcosts $3,995 with PostScript output.andP;  Math software (bought at the same timeas composition) adds $6,000; image-handling software adds $3,000.andP;  The threetogether cost $11,995.andM;Other options include batch pagination ($5,000); hyphenation packages forother languages ($950); TIFF and EPS translators ($500); converters fordesktop packages ($2,500 for the set of four mentioned above); and a&quot;toolbox&quot; of conversion, font, and keyboard utilities ($3,000).andM;Targeting Quadex.andP;  In a brash move, Bedford has decided to go after Quadex'slarge base of advertising typographers.andP;   Bedford thinks it can meet theQuadex users' needs for high-quality type, and it feels it has better toolsthan Quadex can offer.andM;At Type-X, Bedford shared with the press a survey done on its behalf byLaurent Associates.andP;  The anonymous telephone survey involved 10 percent ofQuadex users.andP;  It determined that Quadex users wanted to be able to deal withgraphics and to accept desktop-publishing files.andP;  But they didn't want togive up the typographic quality and user-programmability of Quadex, and theydidn't want to abandon standing files of Quadex jobs.andM;Bedford expects it can entice the Quadex users with a newly developedconversion package that brings Quadex files into the Bedford environment.andO;Bedford has always had high-quality typography and a built-in userprogramming language.andP;  On the Mac platform, Bedford has graphics facilitiesand a link to the desktop environment.andP;  Bedford made its case in apresentation of its survey results to the Quadex Users Group, meetingconcurrently with Type-X.andM;Berthold starts North American pushandM;Although none of its products were new, Berthold considered this Type-X to bea very important one: it was the formal kickoff of the company's new thrustinto the North American market.andP;  if you think you've heard that before,you're right.andP;  Perhaps you've heard it more than once.andP;  But this time theproducts are ready, the staff is in place, a little momentum has beenachieved by some recent installations, and the German company has its feetsolidly on the ground to provide the necessary support.andM;How does the future look?andM;The company.andP;  The North American operation currently employs about 20 people,including Tom Malone, president and chief executive officer.andP;  He needs nointroduction, having spent terms recently with Magna, Qubix and Autologicafter serving successively as manager of publications at McDonnell Douglasand service bureau general manager at Volt Information Systems.andM;Dan Roppolo, the new vice president of sales and service, started in sales atAM International, where he rose to become national sales manager overseeingthe activities of 48 district managers and 200 sales representatives.andP;  Helater served as western regional manager at Xyvision.andM;Jay Gottfried has been appointed manager of product marketing.andP;  His 16-yearcareer includes terms with Hastech, Itek and ImagiTex, mostly inproduct-related capacities.andM;And, as we reported last December, Randy Martin is vice president of financeand administration.andM;Syntax.andP;  Introduced by Berthold at IPEX last September, the Syntax system isa Berthold OEM version of Magna's PC composition system.andP;  Type-X was itsAmerican debut.andM;In software composition capabilities, there is no difference between whatBerthold and Magna are currently selling.andP;  But Magna is under contract todevelop new features that will only be available in Syntax.andP;  As it stands,one difference between Magna and Syntax is that Syntax drives Bertholdrecorders and offers access to the entire Berthold font library, a factorthat might be of interest to some users who want a PC-based system instead ofBerthold's Sun-based one.andM;A further difference concerns marketing.andP;  Berthold is selling the productonly as a hardware/software package, including IBM PS/2 Model 70(80386-based) and model 30 ('286) machines.andP;  A typical four-workstationsystem, equipped with Model 70 workstations, a 70-MB file server, compositionand pagination software, proof printer and Berthold recorder driver is about$60,000.andM;Berthold has sold a few Syntax systems in Europe, but none yet in the U.S.andO;The company says it will find U.S.andP;  customers from among people who wantbetter hardware and software support from a single supplier than they mightget otherwise (from local computer dealers and Magna's staff, presumably).andO;Berthold is gambling that a portion of the typesetting market is looking forturnkey PC-based systems, rather than buying the hardware and softwareseparately.andP;  We are unsure how large that market is, but we wonder howrealistic it is to think that Berthold's support staff will offer significantadvantages over the of Magna, which has accumulated a wealth of knowledgeabout the program and its users over the last few years.andM;So the potential benefit to Berthold provided by the Syntax deal is that thecompany's salespeople will get a PC-based product to sell.andP;  In some cases,this will mean getting a foot in a door that otherwise wouldn't get there.andO;This presumes, of course, that Berthold's salespeople can find some potentialcustomers who haven't already been visited by Magna's dealers.andM;On the other hand, the traditional market for Berthold products is at theupper extreme of the top end of the market.andP;  From the old Diatronics to theADS-3000 and its APU typesetters to the M-Series, Berthold products haveexemplified in attention to detail and a precision in placement of elementsin a document that no other vendor can match.andP;  They have beenaccompanied--significantly--by a complexity that is probably a requirement ofthe task.andM;In contrast, Magna's system is characterized by speed and ease of use,especially in the context of the traditional commercial market.andP;  Ifprospective customers consider purchasing a Magna system because they thinkit is Berthold on a PC, they may be surprised to find out otherwise.andP;  That'swhere the role of the sales force becomes crucial.andM;M-Series adds BoxTools.andP;  The most notable fact relating to the M-Series isthat release 4.0 software, which we've seen several times in the past, is nowavailable.andP;  As we have reported before, 4.0 includes multipage composition(up to 12 left and 12 right master pages per job, automatic numbering, columnlinking to handle multiple text streams, etc.), the Creative Link thatsupports the Macintosh with Berthold fonts, the headliner program developedby Island Graphics, and the support for all Berthold fonts in the displayfont set.andP;  But there are a few new items in the package, which we willconcentrate on here.andM;The most interesting new item is the BoxTools feature for creating fancyforms.andP;  It provides nice facilities for specifying the type of exterior andinterior corners on a form or box, tints to be applied within the form,adjustments to positioning of elements within the form, etc.andP;  A dialog box isused to access the spec sheet that can be edited (see photo), after which theWYSIWYG window shows the new form.andM;Another key addition is the &quot;Lexicon-D,&quot; a hyphenation and spellingdictionary (120,000 words in the German version, with a comparable numberlikely to be available in English).andP;  The system also includes an exceptionlist that is accessed first, after which the Lexicon is checked.andP;  Words notfound in either list may be broken by logic.andP;  The handamp;j routine can handlemultiple languages within a paragraph--even the assignment of languages toindividual words.andM;Other new items include--finally--a true insert mode in the text window, inwhich text can be inserted anywhere without requiring space to be opened onthe screen; the ability to select a block of text on the screen and save iton disk; a feature for changing text indents to create skews; a command tochange the relative position of a block of text; updating of the x/ycoordinates of the cursor as the operator moves visually within a job; theability of the scanner to scan 3,600 X 3,600 pixels, rather than the former760 X 760; and the use of logos as fonts that can be manipulated like anyfont.andM;The Multipage, BoxTools and Lexicon features are optional.andM;Berthold says it has installed eight M-Series systems in the U.S., includinga million-dollar January sale to Typographic Resources in Chicago and asmaller one in February at a company called CCI, in Lanwdale, CA.andM;CPS: pagination with VenturaandM;Computer Peripheral Sciences demonstrated the Astrotek 3000 + system that wehad seen at the Seybold Seminars (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  13), which incorporatesa '386 processor with the system's main CPU.andP;  One of the functions of the'386 is to provide compatibility with off-the-shelf programs such as VenturaPublisher, which can be used for pagination.andM;At Type-X, CPS showed the latest developments in this area, which includedVentura taking data from both the Astrotek database and the company's PCtypesystem.andP;  Stories were being paginated by Ventura and output in Ace languageon a Chelgraph IBX typesetter, which CPS distributes in the U.S., or on alaser proofer.andP;  Ventura takes information from the Astrotek story headerfields and generates a page index for tracking purposes--including the pagenumber the story is assigned to, the story depth, the headline format, thebody text format, and so on.andP;  The operator at the PC can customize theinformation to be used in the page index.andM;If a story has already been handamp;j'ed by the Astrotek or PC-type system, Venturareceives hard line endings, which it honors, to avoid getting unexpectedresults due to the different composition programs.andP;  Alternatively, raw filescan be sent and composed and paginated using Ventura.andM;The Astrotek operator can embed command codes in a file in support of thetagging/Style sheet facility of Ventura.andM;CPS says Ventura can handle pages as large as an eight-column broadsheetnewspaper, but not the nine-column pages used by some papers.andM;Classified installation.andP;  CPS reported that its PC Classad system has beeninstalled at Harte Hanksin California, where 18 units are running at a singlesite.andP;  Within the next couple of months, Harte Hansk will decide whether itwants additional systems for its other sites.andM;Classified data is sent from the paper's office via modem to aHewlett-Packard computer at a different location, where proprietarycomposition software prepares classified pages.andM;G.O.andP;  Graphics proofer and VJandM;G.O.andP;  Graphics featured its recently completed Modular Proofing System forCompugraphic-compatible systems, including the MCS/PowerView/Integratorseries.andP;  It had been previewed at Type-X last year as software running in aPC, but has since been given final packaging with a Compugraphic-compatibleport.andP;  Also new were some enhancements to the Deskset Desiqn paginationfacilities.andM;The MPS, which supports other vendors' front-end systems driving CGtypesetters as well as CG's own systems, provides true-font output at 300 dpi(or 600 X 300 optionally) using a Canon SX print engine.andP;  It comes with asmall controller cabinet that sits under the printer and provides an LCDpanel for issuing commands.andP;  Included in the price, which has been reducedfrom $6,995 to $5,995, is the controller with eight standard fonts and 12user-selectable ones, but not the print engine (which can be a LaserJet orany other Canon printer).andP;  The controller stores up to 300 fonts, which cost$30 each for the first 24, $20 each up to 74, and $15 each after the 75th.andM;Release 3.0 of Deskset Design software, already delivered to customers, ishighlighted by support for vertical justification.andP;  The system automaticallyinserts space in any of three ways, depending on how the operator sets up theparameters: between lines of text, between paragraphs, or at points in whichvertical bands have been inserted.andP;  The user can specify minimum and maximumvalues to be used.andP;  A vertical justification parameter screen displays thevalues currently active for pagination and column positioning.andM;Another addition to release 3.0 is the ability to map screen and output fontsin situations in which the true display fonts aren't desirable, such as insmall sizes where a different font might be easier to read.andP;  Other changes tothe program include displaying the depth in picas, points and quarter points;support for 8-1/2&quot; X 14&quot; pages; a larger editing buffer; and a fasterpreview.andM;Triple-I adds pixel editorandM;Type-X isn't aimed at the market that Information International generallyserves, but Triple-I appeared in the booth reserved by DocuPro long before anacquisition deal made the latter company part of the former.andP;  Triple-I showedits ad  management and reporting features, which we covered in our lastissue, plus a new pixel editor for its Ad Makeup Station.andP;  The optional pixeleditor provides menus for selecting functions, selectable brush sizes, theability to lock the horizontal or vertical axis while editing, area fillsthat can be used to create masks by removing the original outline, and manyother features.andP;  Editing is done on the high-resolution data file.andM;The program uses the Xerox 7650 scanner (see Xerox under I/O later in thisissue for more details on this scanner).andM;DocuPro showed the same new software release it had introduced at the SeyboldSeminars (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  14).andM;Itek Graphix: life under AB DickandM;The biggest news at Itek Graphix was probably that things are coming togetherafter a trying year.andP;  Signs of change were everywhere, starting with the factthat the company was exhibiting under the AB Dick umbrella.andP;  Since AB Dick'sacquisition of Itek Graphix last summer, the two companies have establishedan organizational structure.andP;  As it now appears, the cameras, processors andplatemakers that made up one branch of the Itek Graphix operation (located inRochester, NY) have been folded into AB Dick's line of related equipment,although they will retain the Itek Graphix brand name.andP;  The Itek Graphixcomposition systems unit (based in Nashua, NH) is now officially named theItek Graphix Composition Systems Division of AB Dick Company.andM;On the product front, things are also starting to clear up.andP;  The long delaysin finishing the PostScript RIP for the IGX 7000PS appear to be over.andP;  The PCversion of the machine is being delivered, while development of the Macintoshversion nears completion.andP;  A new color scanner has been introduced, which iscovered in our section on color systems.andM;The Designitek system that is being counted on to move the company into a newmarket is now being shipped to regular customers.andP;  It was demonstrated withmuch fuller functionality than it had at the fall shows.andM;Not to be ignored is a key change at the bottom end of the product line: theAB Dick InPrint program, developed by Island Graphics to run on the PC, hasbecome a product of the Itek Graphix Composition Systems Division.andP;  As aconsequence of that move, the PTW system apparently is being phased out.andP;  Itwas nowhere in the booth, and we understand that, although it is stillavailable if anyone wants to order it, the lights have gone out on furtherdevelopment efforts.andM;Exit the PTW.andP;  These changes make rational sense.andP;  With each company involvedin both composition systems and press-related equipment, economics dictatedat least a certain amount of consolidation.andP;  But we can't help wondering howthings went wrong with the PTW.andP;  We remember vividly when John Seybold gothis first sneak preview of the program, sometime in the middle of 1984.andP;  Hecame back with a glowing report of its potential.andM;It should have been the right product at the right time.andP;  It ran on the righthardware (the PC), provided a semi-WYSIWYG display and performed handamp;j at athen-unheard-of speed of 6,000 characters per second.andP;  And it was reasonablyeasy to use.andM;But it took a long time to develop style-sheet formatting and pagination, andby the time it was running on a large screen with true fonts, everyone elseran on big screens with some degree of WYSIWYG display.andP;  And where it couldhave been a pioneer in the field of networking PCs, it was too little, toolate here also.andP;  Maybe Itek itself never saw that potential, or perhaps ithad too narrow a view based on years of being satisfied with its share of thelow-end market.andP;  Or maybe we overestimated the product's capabilities.andM;In any event, the PTW will be remembered as an interesting product in aperiod of transition, a true pioneer, if perhaps an underachiever.andP;  But itdoesn't depart without leaving a legacy.andP;  Itek Graphix's two currentproducts--the Designitek and InPrint--both will soon support the PTW'sexcellent text-conversion routine.andP;  That may not be as memorable as thelasting contributions made by the Comp/Sets, EditWriters and Quadriteks ofdays gone by, but it fills a very important role.andM;InPrint.andP;  AB Dick said it was using Type-X to &quot;relaunch&quot; the InPrint productafter making a significant number of enhancements.andP;  We seem to rememberhearing the same thing at Graph Expo a year or two ago, when the bugs hadbeen cleaned up and the company was looking for a fresh start.andP;  The changesthis time include hardware, software and pricing.andM;InPrint now runs on a 16-MHz '386 PC with 3 MB of memory, a 65-MB hard diskand a 19-inch Sigma Designs LaserView monitor (1664 X 1200 resolution).andP;  Thebasic system, which now costs $17,995 (reduced $2,000 from its previousprice), includes a 400-dpi Canon laser printer, 35 Adobe-compatible fonts andsoftware for pagination, drawing and painting.andP;  With the Itek Graphix IGX7000PS LED imagesetter, the system price is $47,495.andP;  A scanner is optionalin either configuration.andM;The software now runs under Windows 2.1 and supports spooling to the outputdevice, downloadable fonts, manual kerning and a new copyfit feature thatcalculates either the amount of copy that will be required to fit in a givenwindow using a specified format or the number of windows that will be neededto accommodate an existing text file composed using the specified style.andP;  Itdoesn't go the next step, though, and suggest a size/leading combination thatwould make an existing text file fit in an existing window.andM;InPrint soon will be given new capabilities for importing text from wordprocessors.andP;  This feature will be based on the former PTW Translator.andM;The IGX 7000.andP;  Although we weren't given any samples of halftones produced onthe IGX 7000 (Ace or PostScript version), Itek Graphix says it is nowsupporting 133-line-screen halftones on the machine, which uses a moving LEDarray to image on photographic media.andP;  It also claims to be able to produce100-line tints on the standard machine and 133-line tints with the tintoption.andP;  We will reproduce some samples when we receive them.andP;  We also willbe interested in talking to users who are producing halftones regularly onthe machine.andM;Designitek.andP;  The Designitek system, running on a 25-MHz Sun386i, appeared asa deliverable product for the first time at a major show.andP;  It had beenintroduced last fall as an interactive workstation for designing layouts andflowing text into containers.andP;  As with all of Itek Graphix's products, itprovides good typographic features.andP;  What was new for the company, though,was the move to a higher market segment than it had served before, as well asprovision of an interactive, true-WYSIWYG system, using Bitstream fonts inexact sizes.andM;As previously, the Designitek offers interactive editing on the page as wellas in a window, but a new feature provides a &quot;nonjustifying mode&quot; in whichyou edit with WYSIWYG fonts but suspend composition.andP;  Editing in this mode isfaster than editing on the WYSIWYG page (which is extremely slow), and itdoes not require opening the separate text window.andM;Key new features include:andM;* Stored formats.andP;  Formats, which can contain command codes or text, aregiven names of up to three characters.andP;  They can be stored in groups andapplied to any job, in much the same manner that documentation systems usestyle sheets.andP;  The definition of the formats can be modified to cause globalchanges to all documents governed by those formats.andP;  One format can callanother one or be nested within another one.andM;* Ripple control.andP;   It is possible to rejustify only the currentandM;container, from the cursor to the end of the job, the entire job, or byunlinking pages and flowing text through as many pages as remain linked.andO;Links can be cut forward or backward, which could be useful if changes arebeing made to two parts of a document and the rest of it needn't berecomposed.andM;* Handamp;J.andP;  An interesting part of the handamp;j routine is its implementation ofpreferential hyphenation points, provided as part of the program supplied byHyphenologist.andP;  It enables the system to use less-preferable hyphenationpoints when setting text to a narrow measure--a handy feature in manysituations.andP;  The user specifies at what point to switch between narrow-columnand regular-column modes.andP;  A small but updatable exception dictionary hasbeen added.andM;* User interface.andP;  Size changes and similar commands can be &quot;bumped&quot;incrementally with the mouse or keyboard, rather than having to be specifiedvia new commands.andP;  Also nice is the way some of the menu fields cycle throughthe available options, making it easy to select the desired one.andP;  Otherfeatures include commands to go directly to the first, last, next or previouspage, and keyboard shortcuts for key functions.andM;* Display.andP;  The display can be zoomed up or down to show more or less of the5-foot-by-5-foot drawing area.andP;  Pages can be arranged on the screen in anyorder to suit the operator's convenience.andP;  Thumbnails--which are &quot;live&quot;--canbe stacked to show a large number of pages of a long document at the sametime (see photo).andM;* Spot color.andP;  The provision for color enables the user to specify elementsto be output as different layers, but there are no facilities for separatingcolors into the four process colors.andP;  Colors can be applied to text, rulesand fills.andM;* Alignment.andP;  Objects can be aligned left, center and right as well as top,middle and bottom.andM;* Rotation.andP;  Elements can be rotated in one-tenth of a degree increments byentering a value or visually.andP;  Multiple elements can be grouped and rotated,and rotated text may be edited.andM;A complete Designitek system, consisting of a Sun386i/250, software and anIGX 7000PS imaging device, costs $64,995.andP;  The company says it beganinstalling the system in late March and has been seeing a great deal ofinterest.andP;  Customers to date have been design houses and book and magazinecompositors.andM;Magna goes graphicandM;Magna was demonstrating its system on the latest Novell Netware (version2.15), with support for the Macintosh.andP;  It had Macs running Picture Publisherand ImageStudio, showing off its new facilities for handling scanned images.andO;The graphics capabilities go beyond those items, though.andP;  Magna supportsimporting Encapsulated PostScript and TIFF files, as well as halftones,continuous-tone pictures and line art from a variety of scanners (ImagiTex,ECRM, Truvel, Xerox, Microtek and Datacopy).andP;  Graphics reside in a centralstorage area, where they are accessible by other programs and by anyworkstations on the network.andM;Graphics can be brought into text files for previewing on the screen andoutput on imagesetters able to handle them.andP;  The user embeds in a Magna textfile the command specifying the graphic to be inserted, including its depthand width.andP;  The graphic then will be scaled to match the desiredmeasurements, in the proportions specified.andP;  There are no facilities forcropping the graphic on the page or for bringing it in scaled to onedimension only (to avoid anamorphic distortion).andP;  Nor is there any means ofscaling it after it is displayed.andP;  To resize it, the user must bring it inagain by specifying new commands.andM;The graphic can be previewed using the normal preview function, which isreasonably quick even with images included, or it can be suppressed from thepreview.andP;  Similarly, when pages are output, the graphic can be printed orsuppressed.andM;The area in which the graphic is placed can be enclosed in a box ofuser-specified thickness.andM;Text can be placed within a graphic box using the normal text facilities.andM;Better links to XyWrite.andP;  Magna also has been working on its links toXyWrite.andP;  A keyboard command from within XyWrite now sends a file to the handamp;jsubdirectory, where it is queued for composition using the Magna handamp;j program.andO;Another command brings the handamp;j'ed file back, with line breaks and othermessages shown using the same colors as Magna uses for the messages.andP;  Magnasaid it is looking into the possibility of displaying the handamp;j depth of thefile when it comes back, but that hasn't been done yet.andM;Multiple files sent successively for handamp;j are put into the queue and assignedto the first available processor, just as Magna's own files are queued forcomposition.andP;  If the XyWrite operator tries to call a file back before it isfinished, an error messge is generated.andM;Other news.andP;  Magna had hoped to demonstrate automatic handling of footnotes,but it wasn't quite ready.andP;  A few other new items were present, though,including a fully functional BACKSPACE key (it didn't used to work withinmenus), use of the RETURN key to generate a paragraph break, the ability todisallow background composition on individual workstations if desired, anddisplay of special characters on the monospaced screen.andM;Magna also is focusing on providing better support for foreign languages.andO;The automatic quotation marks facility now recognizes which language isoperative so it can generate the correct marks.andP;  The setup screen nowsupports use of true-cut accented characters instead of using floatingaccents with standard characters.andP;  Customizing has been carried out so that,for example, in Germany a &quot;D&quot; specifies the language (Deutsch), whereas inthe U.S.andP;  a &quot;G&quot; would call for German.andM;Miles reaches OasysandM;Like other traditional typesetting-system vendors, Miles has been workinghard to address the market interest in standard platforms.andP;  In Miles' case,the selected platform is Sun Micro-systems workstations, running Unix.andP;  Thetransition to Sun is now complete, and Miles showed its Sun-based system,Oasys, at Type-X.andP;  (Non-WYSIWYG functions in the Miles system--those thatused to be done on Miles' monospaced &quot;Finch&quot; terminals--can be run onIBM-compatible PCs as well.)andP;  Miles runs on both the Sun-4 series (based onSun's SPARC reduced instruction set chips) and the Sun-3 series (based on the68000).andP;  It requires 8 MB of memory.andM;Miles, which has long had good batch pagination, also used the show todemonstrate a preliminary version of its new interactive page-makeupsoftware, good for magazine-style page makeup.andM;When using the Miles system for batch pagination, you can start by setting upthe basic page format and the pagination rules.andP;  The system solves paginationproblems by reference to a &quot;try table&quot; that tells what variations fromstandard spacing are permitted.andP;  For example, you may tell the system to tryinitially adding space around illustrations and then, if that doesn't work,to expand space around heads.andP;  The system will go through a series of these&quot;tries&quot; until it finds something that works.andP;  (If nothing works, you get anerror message.)andP;  There is also an easy method (called &quot;page fix&quot;) to go intoa paginated file and force a page break (either pushing text back to thepreceding page or forward to the next one).andP;  The system will recompose onlythe affected pages.andM;The text file that is being paginated contains composition commands.andP;  Mileslets you work with this monospaced-text-and-commands file at the same time asyou work with the WYSIWYG display.andP;  This is done using the &quot;contextualeditor.&quot; With a composed WYSIWYG file on the screen, you invoke the editor.andO;It appears in a separate window, with a cursor positioned at the same pointin the file as the cursor in the WYSIWYG display.andP;  You can then edit thecodes and the text as you like.andM;Math continues to be a strength of the Miles system.andP;  Although the mathpackage has not changed, the high-quality Sun display shows it off toparticularly good advantage in WYSIWYG mode.andM;Miles gets good performance out of its Sun platform.andP;  The Sun-4 on which wegot our demo was able to compose and paginate at better than three pages asecond in two-column work with lots of footnotes.andM;While its batch pagination is generally strong, Miles offers few options forillustration placement.andP;  You choose one of four placement options--top,bottom, center of page, or directly at the anchor point--to apply to thewhole job.andP;  You can then go back and override the program's placementdecisions for particular items.andP;  For work involving frequent illustrations(for example, medical journals), it would be nice to have more placementcontrol.andM;Graphics.andP;  At Type-X, Miles showed a new graphics facility for line art.andP;  Thetasks it can perform include cropping, scaling (including anamorphicstretching), inversion (black for white), mirroring, and rotation inone-degree increments.andP;  There is no drawing or pixel-editing facility, butSun's new SunPaint and SunDraw could fill this need.andP;  A Macintosh interfacedto a Sun workstation was being demonstrated as a source of TIFF-formatgraphics at the show.andM;So far, there is no support for halftones.andM;PageMake.andP;  Miles showed a preliminary version of Page-Make, a program formagazine-style page production.andP;  The user begins by setting up page grids anddrawing boxes on them.andP;  Text can then be flowed into the boxes.andP;  Boxes can belinked together (by drawing lines between them), and the text will flow fromone to the next.andM;There are several nice touches.andP;  One is the ability to flow text inbackwards, starting from the final column.andP;  This approach is often used whenmagazines are paged by hand.andP;  The idea is to fill the later pages solid andaccumulate whatever space is available on the opening page or spread, wherethe designer can work with it or the sink of the title can be adjusted tomake the initial page look good.andP;  We also liked the way excess text, ifpresent, simply hangs off the bottom of the page.andP;  This shows the operatorgraphically that the story is overset, and gives a visual idea of how bad theproblem is.andP;  (If the story is flowed from the back of the article, the excesssticks up off the top of the front page.)andM;The program will eventually have much more capability than was shown atType-X.andP;  For example, it will be possible to show multiple pages on thescreen, and to link stories from one to the next.andP;  At Type-X, onlyprecomposed galleys could be placed, but placing of raw text (which is thencomposed to fit the boxes) will be part of the product when released.andP;  Thecontextual editor, described above, will be integrated into PageMake.andM;PageMake is scheduled to be shipped on July 15.andM;Pricing.andP;  Miles sells the Sun hardware at list price.andP;  (Suitable workstationsrange from $20,000 to $35,000, depending on configuration and power.)andO;Software for the initial Sun workstation, including composition, batchpagination, and one output driver, runs about $40,000.andP;  A PostScript outputdriver would add $12,500.andP;  The math package is $12,000.andP;  The graphics editoris $12,500.andP;  And PageMake, while not definitively priced, may sell for around$15,000.andP;  For additionald workstations, Miles charges $12,000 to let you runwhatever software you already have on the first workstation.andP;  (This policymay not apply for PageMake, though.)andM;Miles now has 35 systems in 26 sites in the U.S., and U.S.andP;  operations arevery profitable, we are told.andP;  This volume of sales is impressive when youconsider that these are sales to new customers.andP;  Miles has not had the luxurythat the established U.S.andP;  vendors have had of depending heavily on sales tothe existing customer base to help them through their transition to thefourth-wave world.andM;Miles is traditionally strong in batch composition and pagination, andPageMake will provide tools for interactive page makeup as well.andP;  Miles doesnot have an editorial offering, and the company doesn't plan to develop one.andO;What may be developed instead is a tight interface to XyWrite, permittingeditors to edit to fit from the XyWrite environment.andM;Newport: the catch that got awayandM;Newport Technologies, which had used the Seybold Seminars as the venue forthe debut of its Textline PC composition program, had planned to introduceits Catchall text and image retrieval system at Type-X.andP;  But hardwareproblems in shipment prevented Catchall from being shown, so Newport wentwith the same basic demonstration as at the Seminars (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  13).andM;We did have the opportunity to find out a little about Catchall, though.andP;  Itwas developed in England by Computer andamp; Aerospace Components, Ltd., for usewith Kurzweil Discover scanners.andP;  It's a scanner control program that cancompress images up to 30:1 for storage and retrieval.andP;  It also providesfull-text search and retrieval functions.andM;Catchall currently is undergoing beta testing in the UK.andM;We were also told that enhancements to Textline include a XyWrite filter,improved hyphenation, &quot;Americanization&quot; of menus that had been using Germanwords, and support for TIFF formats.andM;Penta makes strong Type-X showingandM;Penta put on an impressive display of new products at Type-X.andP;  Keyannouncements included a new scanner and PC-based graphics subsystem,completely rewritten batch pagination software, and a remoteediting/layout/proofing subsystem for service bureaus to offer theircustomers.andM;The company appears to have come through a difficult period in good shape.andO;It struggled through the first half of 1988.andP;  In September, Penta bit thebullet.andP;  It cut $2.5 million from its annual expenses, including a payrollreduction of $600,000 through layoffs.andP;  The cuts were selective and wereaccompanied by reorganization to minimize the impact on customers and onproduct development.andP;  (The reorganization brought the groups responsible forsales support, training, documentation, and customer service into a singleentity under Carl White.)andP;  No programmers were let go.andM;The new products at Type-X are evidence that Penta did not sacrifice productdevelopment to gain financial health.andP;  And Penta's tough fiscal measures areevidently having the desired effect: the first 1989 quarter was profitable.andO;Final figures were released just before this issue went to press; see page 2for details.andM;ScanMaster.andP;  ScanMaster is Penta's new PC-based workstation for scannedgraphics.andP;  Penta continues to offer an Imagi-Tex-based graphics subsystem,but some prospects wanted a lower-cost alternative.andP;  ScanMaster addressesthis need at a price that will be &quot;slightly over $50,000.&quot;andM;ScanMaster is based on a Wyse 386-based PC connected to the Xerox 7650flatbed monochrome scanner.andP;  The scanner stores 8 bits per pixel of gray dataand samples at user-specified resolutions up to 1,200 dots per inch.andP;  An800-MB write-once optical disc drive is used for image storage.andP;  (The 800-MBremovable discs cost about $150 each.)andM;The scanner is equipped with considerable image-processing power, which Pentamakes use of.andP;  Halftoning is done by the scanner, and it also handles imagesharpening and &quot;descreening&quot; previously screened and printed halftones.andP;  Thescanner is self-calibrating (though you can override its settings), and itcan scan line art as well as contone images (see coverage of Xerox under I/Ofor more details).andM;When the system is used primarily for sizing, placing, and cropping, therewould be two scanning passes.andP;  The first would provide a screen image forplacement on the page; the second would create a halftoned, output-ready filethat is cropped and sized to fit the layout.andM;But Penta also has a mechanism for altering photos, and the flow is differentif it is used.andP;  Penta provides the Astral &quot;Picture Publisher&quot; retouchingpackage.andP;  With Picture Publisher, scanning is done only once, at fullresolution.andP;  The image data is manipulated in Picture Publisher, and then itis sent back to the scanner, where halftoning is performed.andM;Initially, Penta will support image output to PostScript and Tegra outputdevices; other drivers will be added if there is customer interest.andM;An early version of ScanMaster has already been delivered to a customer inEurope, but Penta won't consider the package finished until it is integratedinto the MS-Windows environment.andP;  (Right now, certain functions must be donein GEM.)andP;  Penta has standardized on Windows as the environment for all the PCsoftware it offers.andM;MasterPage.andP;  Penta is rewriting its batch pagination software, taking intoaccount various customer requests over the years.andP;  The release shown atType-X is the first of a series that Penta plans over the next year and ahalf.andM;The most striking area of change was the greater control users now have overillustration placement.andP;  There are now quite a few placement options.andP;  Youcan send illustrations to the top, bottom, or center of the page.andP;  You canconfine them to only even-numbered or only odd-numbered pages.andP;  You can&quot;stagger&quot; illustrations, so that the first illustration on a two-column pageappears in the top left position and the second in the bottom right.andP;  (Othercombinations are also possible.)andP;  You can force an illustration to appearbefore its callout, either in  the same column or page as the callout or on aprevious page.andP;  You can also associate priorities with all these options sothat the software knows the order it should attempt them in.andP;  This means thateven complex placement rules can be expressed.andP;  One way or another, thesetools should let most people specify how their illustrations are to beplaced.andM;There are also new tools for creating and saving page layouts.andP;  Fixed partsof the layout, such as running heads and feet, are created as &quot;specific text&quot;blocks.andP;  You can have as many of these as you like on the page, and the textbeing paginated will flow around them.andP;  Exception pages with specialspecific-text blocks may be created.andP;  Page layouts are created by simplecommands in split-screen mode: commands are entered in the left-hand window,and the corresponding changes appear in the page diagram at the right.andM;Pagination performance has been improved in several ways.andP;  The new softwareruns 40 percent faster than its predecessor.andP;  It runs as a separate task fromnormal handamp;j, so it won't cause other composition tasks to wait for it tofinish (which was a difficulty with Penta's previous pagination software).andO;It also will back up a page to attempt to solve &quot;problem pages.&quot;andM;To check the results of pagination, the user may choose between the WYSIWYGPC Preview on the PC and the review status mode of the Saturn, which showssingle pages but without the screen font display.andM;Those who use Penta's software for 3-column work will appreciate theprovision of a mechanism for heads straddling two of three columns.andO;Previously, either heads were confined to the text column measure or theystraddled the entire page.andM;As with other Penta software, MasterPage pricing varies with the size of theconfiguration.andP;  For a mid-range system, the price is $11,000.andP;  Penta has thesoftware running at four beta-test sites, and it should be available to anycustomer by the time this is published.andM;AdPro.andP;  AdPro represents another new theme at Penta: carefully targetedmarketing.andP;  In this case, the target market is businesses specializing insetting advertising type.andP;  Most of the components of AdPro are part of thestandard Penta product line, but they are assembled in a package suited tothis particular market.andM;The key new item in AdPro is support for irregular runarounds using agraphics tablet and puck.andP;  The runaround is specified by laying the ad layoutdown on the tablet, clicking on vertical alignment points, and delineatingthe boundary of the graphic by clicking on several points around it.andP;  You getto specify the &quot;bear-off&quot;: the distance by which the text will be &quot;repelled&quot;by the graphic.andP;  If all you want to do is set galleys with the properindents, you don't even need to invest in a WYSIWYG terminal to use thisfacility.andM;The attractiveness of the AdPro package is enhanced by several-ad-relatedadditions to Penta's composition.andP;  One is an optional set-to-fit facility, inwhich the software will make a given piece of text fit a specified area byvarying its parameters.andP;  You tell it what to vary: point size, leading,measure, wordspacing, etc.andP;  Another useful enhancement is an enlarged kerningcapability.andP;  Penta has long had 512 kerning pairs per font--in itself, notmuch of a limitation--but they were defined in such a way that all fonts usedthe same pairs of characters (albeit with different amounts of kerning ineach font).andP;  Penta has now expanded this facility to allow 1,980 characterpairs, with different kerning values in each font.andM;These changes are not specific to the AdPro package, but they would be usefulin setting ads.andM;A small AdPro configuration starts at around $40,000 including the softwareand the graphics tablet, but not including workstations.andM;Windows progress.andP;  Penta has been busy porting software to the MS-DOSoperating system, using Microsoft Windows as its operating environment.andP;  Thischoice simplifies software development.andP;  Using Windows drivers, Penta caninterface to various printers and monitors.andP;  Font utilities allow Penta toprovide up to 600 on-screen pi characters.andP;  And various programs can bedisplayed together on the screen (e.g., editorial software in one window,page layout in another, preview of composed material in a third).andM;In its editing software, Penta has done a good job of integrating thehandling of files from the local (MS-DOS) disk and from the Data Generalserver.andP;  You can bring up files of both types on either side of a splitscreen and work with them in exactly the same way.andM;The PCs may be connected by a serial cable to the Data General server.andP;  Thatapproach means that it is simple to implement remote terminals, theconnection being made via modem instead of direct cabling.andP;  This opens upsome interesting opportunities.andP;  In private demos, Penta showed a prototypeof a product (as yet unnamed) for use by Penta compositors who want to placeremote facilities in customer premises.andM;A possible setup consists of a PC running Penta editorial and page-layoutsoftware, plus a laser printer (with its PC controller) for proofing composedoutput.andP;  This arrangement would allow a customer (working over phone lines)to compose text to fit a layout and review the depth and line-endings, andthen to output the proof pages locally.andP;  The user would embed generic codes(not typesetting codes), and all composition would be handled by the serverfacility.andM;For magazine publishers who don't want to set up their own compositionoperation, and who don't want to purchase a high-resolution typesettingdevice, this approach makes a lot of sense.andP;  The compositor sets up thetypography associated with the generic codes, and also takes care of mattersrelating to font setup, kerning, and the like.andP;  The publisher, though, hascomplete control of layout and content, and can easily edit to fit.andP;  Weexpect that many publishers, especially those who shy away from acquiring thetypographic knowledge required to set high-quality type on their own desktopsystems, would find this scenario attractive.andM;Field testing of this setup is just getting under way.andP;  If it provessuccessful, it will be introduced as a product later.andP;  The cost of a basicone-terminal remote setup, including PC, software, 9600-baud modem and proofprinter, is $20,000--$25,000.andM;Penta in Europe.andP;  Penta is centralizing its European operations in its Frenchoffice.andP;  It has found that the UK market is not big enough to support a salesoffice, whereas sales in France are strong.andP;  (Penta will still keep somesupport staff in the UK.)andP;  With the lowering of tariff barriers in 1992,Penta will serve all of Europe conveniently from its French base.andM;How Penta fits in the market.andP;  Penta has now finished most of the hardtransition to providing systems based on standard platforms.andP;  Most functionscan now be performed from PCs.andP;  While it is true that there is still a DataGeneral minicomputer at the heart of the system, its role is greatly reduced.andO;It acts primarily as a file server, a role which it performs admirably and atreasonable cost.andP;  For the moment, the mini also runs composition software,but this will also be moved to the PCs.andM;Penta can now compete with all-PC solutions on price.andP;  The heavy use of PCsprovides a key benefit of standard-platform approaches: the ability to runother software applications on the PCs.andP;  And Penta's improving financialsituation should encourage prospects who may have been concerned aboutPenta's ability to continue developing and supporting the product.andM;It is interesting to compare Penta's situation now with those of Atex andXyvision.andP;  Atex, finally committed to developing systems incorporatingoff-the-shelf hardware and software, is scrambling to develop and deliverthem.andP;  Xyvision has not yet fully addressed the standard-platform issue.andO;Penta seems well ahead of both of these traditional rivals in its transitionto the fourth-wave world of PCs.andM;Purdy's Panda into the ringandM;Although it had been previewed at the Seybold Seminars, Peter Purdy's newsystem, based on Archetype's display  ad/composition workstation, made itsformal debut at Type-X.andP;  In our coverage of the Seminars, we described thestandalone system and noted that Peter had inserted his own font board andSpiroScan fonts into the system, but that the composition program itself wasbasically the same as Archetype's Designer.andM;Called the Panda system (from the company name, Purdy and Associates), italso includes some nice networking/file management facilities and the GenEditword processor that is available for basic editing needs.andP;  It runs on aNovell network and drives typesetters running most of the common languages:Compugraphic, Cora, Ace, PostScript, APS and Monotype.andM;We particularly like the extra file management features the system provides.andO;The function for &quot;getting files from the server&quot; permits generation ofselective directories from within any subdirectories on any disk drivesaccessible by the system.andP;  The user specifies the criteria, which includefile size, so it is possible to get a list of all files within a certainlength range.andP;  The system also will perform a keywood search of the contentsof all files listed on the screen, from which it will generate a new list ofall those files containing one or more of up to 30 keywords (using theboolean &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; statements).andM;From a directory of files, the operator can select one file and see a windowof additional information, including the number of lines the file contains aswell as its path (drive) and other standard DOS status.andP;  Also displayed in awindow at the bottom of the screen is the text of the file, which can bescrolled freely.andM;The system also has nice backup features, including a single command to backup all files that have been changed since the last backup, convenient manualbackup procedures, and a feature that automatically backs up all files thathave been changed in the interval of time set by the system manager.andM;There is a function for moving files from one directory to another.andM;These file management features are available from within the Designer programor within GenEdit, which is a word processor designed to conform to theArchetype user interface and to provide an easy means of making editingchanges.andP;  One of its key functions is to embed formatting tags in files,which can be done by selecting a block of text and choosing a tag from apulldown menu.andP;  If desired, the system will tag all  paragraphs to the end ofthe job with a selected tag, rather than requiring the user to embed the tagsone by one.andP;  (With the Archetype system, any paragraphs that don't have tagsare automatically given the default tag.)andM;The Panda system offers nice flexibility in other areas also.andP;  Menus can becustomized, such as to add items and create batch files to access thefunctions.andP;  Individual workstations can be prohibited from performing certainactivities (although it would be nice if this were based on the operator'slogon, rather than the workstation).andM;Files to be output are sent to a queue according to the priority assigned tothem by the user--urgent or normal.andP;  Once in the queue, they are processedsequentially according to the order in which they arrived.andM;The market.andP;  Archetype's Designer is rapidly becoming one of the mostomnipresent products on the market.andP;  It is being sold by CText as a displayad terminal, by Atex as a magazine pagination system, by Archetype VARs fordisplay ads, and now by Purdy and Associates.andP;  Where will Purdy's people finda market?andM;Their targets are tabloid newspapers, ad agencies and commercial printersinvolved with page-oriented publications such as magazines.andP;  The companyactually has a pretty good track record already, having sold about 40 systemsoverseas, where the product is called Typoline and is sold by 12 distributorsfrom Singapore to Portugal.andP;  We were told that nearly half of the systemshave gone to ad agencies, including McCann-Erickson.andP;  A few have been soldfor newspaper production and the rest to commercial printers.andM;The U.S.andP;  market isn't an easy one to crack, but Peter has a wealth ofexperience and an attractive product.andP;  If he can get a solid organizationtogether, he is likely to surprise a few people and do quite well.andM;A Panda Designer system isn't cheap.andP;  A single workstation consisting of a25-MHz '386 PC, 4 MB of memory, 30-MB hard disk, high-resolution monitor(1664 X 1200), Designer software and 200 fonts costs $19,950.andP;  A '386-basedfile server costs about $15,000.andP;  An input control unit is available forsupporting wire services and PCs, for a price of about $9,000.andP;  An outputcontrol unit handling two parallel and two serial ports costs slightly lessthan that.andP;  An Ultre recorder with 200 fonts is priced at $39,500.andP;  Optionsinclude a Canon SX laser proof printer, a dual file server, an asynchronouscommunications server and additional editorial stations.andP;  Put it all togetherand it quickly passes the century mark.andM;Purdy and Associates is located at 100 Perimeter Rd., Nashua, NH 03063; phone(603) 883-9796.andM;DP Telos adds features, network supportandM;Telos has a number of customers running its software now, and as a result ofsuggestions from them, it has added several new features to its version 2.4batch pagination program.andM;* Long tags.andP;  Style tags (format names) can now be up to eight characterslong.andP;  (They had been limited to two.)andP;  This allows tag names to be much moremnemonic.andM;* User dictionaries.andP;  The program can create and edit a secondary dictionaryfor spelling and hyphenation.andP;  This supports specialized vocabularies and(since the user dictionary is checked first) allows a controllable overrideof words in the main dictionary.andM;* &quot;Suspend&quot; command.andP;  A new command has been added to the repertoire.andP;  Whenthe &quot;suspend&quot; command is encountered within a style definition, execution ofthe remaining commands in the style is suspended (and processing of text isresumed) until a specified character is found within the text.andP;  Thischaracter can be any text symbol, including the end-of-paragraph marker.andO;When the character is found, the computer automatically returns to thesuspended style and picks up where it left off.andP;  Any number of suspendcommands can be put into a style.andM;* Insert text.andP;  Another new command allows up to nine characters to be copiedfrom a style into the text stream.andP;  (If you need more than nine, simply giveseveral insert commands in a row.)andP;  These characters can be anything,including further commands.andM;* Insert counter.andP;  The system supports counters, along with commands to setthem based on the text being processed.andP;  Earlier, the counters could only becompared and tested for controlling conditional commands.andP;  Now, the value ofany counter can be directly placed into the text stream, which allowsautomatic numbering of figures and sections.andP;  Multi-level outlines are easilynumbered by using one counter for each level of indention.andM;* Additional vertical-justification controls.andP;  New commands let you specify aforced page or column break and give better handling of short pages (or pageswith no variable spaces for VJ).andP;  There is also a new &quot;hold&quot; command; likethe existing keep-lines commands, it prevents a page break within a specifieddistance from the command, but it works with absolute depth rather thannumber of lines, and it is not governed by the penalty weights--it isimmediate and inviolable.andM;* Vertical zones.andP;  This feature allows creation of &quot;columns within columns,&quot;in a manner similar to tabular matter.andP;  (It can be combined with horizontaltabs to make some tables easier to do.)andP;  It is intended for creatingside-heads and similar effects.andP;  The contents of up to eight zones(subcolumns) can be entered in any order.andP;  For vertical justificationpurposes, the second-deepest zone is treated as though a hold command wereapplied.andM;* Leader fill.andP;  A given string (with an arbitrary number of characters) canbe inserted as many times as possible until the measure is filled.andM;Networking.andP;  Even more important than the new functions and features, Telosnow supports multiple users with Novell Netware.andP;  There is little change tothe overall &quot;look and feel&quot; of the program, except that text files,dictionaries and so on may be located on a network server disk.andP;  Netwareprovides file locking and network security services automatically.andM;We are looking forward to experimenting with the networked version of Telos,leading up to a full report on its abilities later in the year.andM;Ultimate imposing signaturesandM;Ultimate showed a number of small but useful enhancements to its typographicrepertoire.andP;  They include:andM;* Enhanced tracking control, defined in fractions of relative units;andM;* Automatic breaking of ligatures when letterspacing exceeds a prescribedamount;andM;* Manual kerning of text or rules into margins (helpful if a specific linelooks slightly short);andM;* Control of hyphenation of column-ending and page-ending lines;andM;* A facility to permit or forbid hyphenation of words containing em-dashes,en-dashes, slashes and other legal break-points; andandM;* An &quot;image area margin&quot; command to move a page image on the output material,or to move a table laterally within a page.andM;ColorStrip.andP;  ColorStrip is a forthcoming extension of Ultimate's PostStripimposition program.andP;  When ColorStrip is used with Ultimate's typesettingsoftware, it will be possible for the user to indicate the intended color oftints, rules, and text elements.andP;  This can be expressed in Pantone's numbersand screen percentages.andP;  The appropriate separations will then be generated.andM;The principles of ColorStrip were demonstrated at Type-X via a text case: theactual manual for the PostStrip package.andP;  The manual, with a page size of 6&quot;X 9&quot;, was printed 16 pages to a flat.andP;  Plates were made from negative filmoutput directly by PostStrip, which produced all 16 pages in two long stripsof typesetter film, each containing eight imposed page images.andP;  The twostrips were assembled into a flat (with very little opaquing required) andplates were made.andP;  There was no camera work.andM;The manual was a two-color job (black and magenta), and both sets ofnegatives were produced the same way.andP;  The manual had lots of diagrams(created within the typesetting software) containing magenta tint-filledboxes bordered by half-point rules.andP;  A quarter-point of trapping was obtainedby specifying that the half-point rules were to be centered on the boundaryof the boxes.andP;  This allowed the job to be printed with no signs of a gapbetween the rule and the tint, nor of tint extending beyond the rule.andM;To the ColorStrip product we saw, Ultimate will add facilities for previewingthe colored elements in representative colors on the screen, and foroutputting color proofs on color PostStript devices.andP;  There will also beadditional support for chokes and spreads.andM;With its PostStrip and ColorStrip products, Ultimate is positioning itself asa company that concerns itself with the impact of typesetting and desktoppublishing on platemaking and printing issues, issues which are oftenneglected as the technology of the graphic arts spreads to a large newaudience of PC users.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
