(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pat Robertson received a hero's welcomeSaturday from Washington State Republicans, as the party nowdominated by the television evangelist's followers adopted aconservative platform including support for South Africa'sgovernment.   ``You have won a great victory in Washington and I am proud ofyou,'' Robertson said to his supporters, who swept the state'sprecinct caucuses in March.   His campaign may be over for now, ``but ideals and principalsnever lose,'' Robertson said. ``I have no intention of quitting.We're going to keep coming back.''   Robertson's loyal army of supporters, which plans to give thetelevision evangelist his largest block of delegates to thenational GOP convention, went wild as he addressed the convention.   Robertson told his backers they must shift their loyalties tothe party's certain nominee, George Bush, and help elect allRepublican candidates this fall. He called it part of a long-termstrategy of converting America to conservatism.   Robertson picked up 38 of Washington's delegates to theRepublican National Convention in New Orleans. Of the state'sremaining three delegates, one went to Bush and the other two wereuncommitted.   The vice president addressed the convention via telephone fromhis home in Maine, saying, ``We'll come out of the New Orleansconvention (united) to go to fight right down to the wire.''   Robertson told a news conference he'll stump the country forBush, particularly in the states where the television evangelistdid best. He termed himself ``pleased with the conservativeprincipals the vice president is enunciating,'' and said Bushshould pick Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas for hisrinning mate.   ``Bob Dole would be my choice,'' he said.   In addition to hearing Robertson, the convention adopted aconservative platform, including support for South Africa.   The plank on South Africa read: ``We continue to support theSouth African government in its efforts to eliminate apartheid andoppose economic sanctions.''   The platform, less than five pages long, reads like a compendiumof conservative thought. It is against gay rights, a state incometax, abortion, the United Nations, and school health clinics, andfor the deployment Strategic Defense Initiative of space-basedweapons, Contra aid ``everywhere,'' prayer in the schools and morenuclear development.   The convention, which opened Friday, has combined elemens ofpolitics, the circus and a prayer meeting.   The convention hall was festooned in red, white and blue, withhuge pictures of President Reagan flanking a gigantic Americanflag. The crowd cheered when ``Uncle Sam'' rode a huge elephantinto the convention from the circus next door.   There was prayer, amens, a fervent, hymn-like singing of ``GodBless America'' and frequent invocation of God's name.   At one point state GOP chairwoman Jennifer Dunn called forAttorney General Ken Eikenberry to come up to the podium and``address the congregation.''</TEXT></DOC>
