The Commission des Operations de Bourse said Max Theret, abusinessman with close ties to the governing Socialist Party, made``eminently suspicious'' purchases of stock in the U.S. companyTriangle Industries Inc. just before it was acquired by the Frenchstate-owned firm Pechiney SA.   The COB, in an unusual public report, said explanations by Theretand his associates were contradictory and apparently were made upafter the fact, and it appeared that Theret or another official ofhis investment firm, the Compagnie Parisienne de Placements,received an inside tip of the imminent takeover.   The agency recommended a criminal investigation, but said it wasnot able to identify who, in or out of the government, might haveprovided the information for inside trading by Theret or others.   The COB has no enforcement or punishment power, and has no powerto investigate outside of France. The agency can, however,investigate locally and recommend prosecution to the stateprosecutor's office.   Theret's investment firm bought 32,300 shares of Triangle stockjust before the sale to Pechiney and made a profit of $1.4 million.   Theret has said he decided to buy Triangle stock based on hisresearch into the packaging industry and has denied getting insidetips.   The commission also said a close friend of President FrancoisMitterrand, Roger-Patrice Pelat, was among the investors whoprofited by purchasing Triangle stock at about $10 a share in thedays just before Pechiney's $56 a share buyout offer on Nov. 21.   Pelat, his wife and sons made more than $350,000 in the deal, thecommission said, but it did not accuse Pelat of insider trading orany other wrongdoing.   The COB said it found ``serious, precise and concordant''indications of illegal activity, but said it could not identifyanyone guilty of leaking word of the deal.   Commission chairman Jean Farge acknowledged his investigators hadbeen unable to track all the suspicious trading, some of which wasconducted by corporations based in the Caribbean or Switzerland.   Because Pechiney is state-owned, several high governmentofficials were kept informed of the negotiations with Triangle andgovernment approval was required.   Premier Michel Rocard and other Socialist leaders have respondedto the burgeoning scandal in recent weeks by saying previousconservative governments were involved in more serious scandals thanthis one, while promising to bring out the truth and punish anywrongdoing.   The affair led earlier this month to the resignation of AlainBoublil, Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy's top aide, thegovernment official most closely involved with the takeover. Boublilsaid he wanted to be free to defend himself more vigorously.   A series of newspaper and magazine articles strongly have hintedthat Boublil leaked the information.   Pelat, who has known Mitterrand since their days together in aGerman prisoner-of-war camp and in the French Resistance, is one ofsix people identified in the report as having bought shares duringthe few days after the Pechiney-Triangle deal was reached andreported to the French government, but before it was made public.   Pelat's stock moves, and nearly all other elements of thecommission's report, had been widely reported in French newsaccounts of the scandal, which has dominated the political scene forweeks.   But the commission report, with its extensive examination ofTheret's explanation for his purchases, was seen as likely to givenew political impetus to the scandal.</TEXT></DOC>
