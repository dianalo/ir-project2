 Mail ordercompanies offer selection, convenience, and--most important--discounts of upto 40 percent off manufacturers' list prices.andP;  But it's easy to be seducedand abandoned.andP;  Though most mail order companies boast solid reputations aswell as great deals, some don't; a bad choice could leave you with poorservice, lousy products, or no merchandise at all.andM;As always, your best defense is a solid offense.andP;  Thoroughly investigate thecompany you plan to buy from, and always use your credit card when ordering.andO;The detective work may take some time, but it could spare your blood pressureand your bank account.andP;  While many consumer protection agencies will registeryour complaint if you get taken, none of them can force a company to cough upyour money.andM;Check the Fine PrintandM;Begin your investigation by scrutinizing the advertisement.andP;  If it appears ina magazine, check back isues--if the ad has been running regularly, odds arethat the company is stable and has been paying its bills.andM;Then check the ad for a street address.andP;  No address or a post office boxsuggests that the company may be afly-by-night operation run out of abasement or rented room.andP;  Such operators have been known to skip town onceenough checks roll in.andP;  For the same reason, avoid any business that acceptsonly phone orders.andM;A toll-free 800 number adds some evidence of legitimacy.andP;  &quot;If someone can'tget [an 800 number] from the phone company, maybe they haven't been payingtheir phone bills,&quot; explains Peter Haas, vice chairman of the MicrocomputerMarketing Council (MMC) of the Direct Marketing Association, a tradeorganization for direct mail computer companies.andM;Compare the prices offered by several companies.andP;  Your prospective company'sprices should be no more than 25 percent lower than those of the rest of thecompetition.andP;  If the price looks too good to be true, it probably is.andM;Some ads assert that a product has to be defective to be returned, whileothers claim that all sales are final.andP;  Either way, it means trouble--turnthe page and shop elsewhere.andM;If an ad carries a disclaimer stating that the company is unable to guaranteethe compatibility of its products, keep on looking.andP;  While hardware andsoftware compatibility problems sometimes do arise, many companies willminimize this risk with a money-back guarantee and warranties.andM;Get on the PhoneandM;If the ad checks out, find out if the company has a rap sheet by calling theBetter Business Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce in the company's city, andthe consumer protection office in that state.andP;  Contact local or countyconsumer protection offices operating in the company's area.andP;  You'll want toknow how long the company has been in business and the nature of anycomplaints against it.andP;  PC user groups are another good source for this typeof information.andM;Finally, confirm what you've discovered and fill any blanks by calling thecompany directly.andP;  Note the professionalism of customer servicerepresentatives.andP;  If they're impolite and poorly informed now, it can onlyget worse once they've got your money.andM;Be very specific about the product and configuration you want.andP;  Find outwhether it's in stock and its delivery date.andP;  Above all, confirm the price,since many mail order outfits reserve the right to change prices withoutnotice.andM;Make sure all the features and peripherals you want are included in thedeal--for example, some attractive system prices don't include monitors.andO;Check for shipping and handling costs and state taxes.andM;Deal only with companies that accept major credit cards: if MasterCard orVisa won't touch them, you shouldn't either.andP;  Ask if there is an additionalcharge for credit card purchases.andM;Technical assistance is another key issue.andP;  Find out what hours help isavailable and whether the company runs its own service facility.andP;  If you'renot technically proficient and you live far from a trustworthy computerrepair shop, it's best to buy from a company that will provide service.andM;Ask about return and refund policies.andP;  If the goods need replacement orrepair, who pays for shipping?andP;  What is the average turnaround time?andP;  Bewareof companies that charge a &quot;restocking fee&quot; for taking back unwanted goods.andO;Such fees may be legitimate, but the company is still penalizing you forbeing dissatisfied with its merchandise.andM;Double-check the terms and restrictions of the money-back guarantee, and knowwhat type of warranty is offered.andP;  You can avoid headaches by sticking withmail order companies that offer their own warranties.andM;Take notes during your conversations that include the names of everyone youtalked to and the dates and times of phone calls.andP;  Keep a file with thisinformation and a copy of the advertisement you responded to; it is alwaysinvaluable during any dispute with a mail order company.andM;Credit Cards Give You the EdgeandM;When it comes to payment, credit cards provide a tremendous amount ofleverage if there's a problem.andP;  While credit cards have limitations onwithholding payment--the seller must be located in your home state or within100 miles of your home, and the purchase must exceed $50--these stipulationscan be circumvented by the Federal Trade Commission's Fair Credit BillingAct.andP;  The act allows you to withhold payment after making a good-faith effortto resolve the problem.andM;To stop payment with a credit card, a process known as &quot;charging back,&quot; youshould notify in writing the financial institution that issued you the card.andO;Send the letter via certified mail within 60 days of the mailing of the firstdisputed bill.andP;  Don't ever use your corporate credit card, because it doesn'tafford the same stop-payment protection; and never accept a charge on youraccount before you have the goods.andP;  While charging you for a product beforeyou receive it is not illegal, the practice is considered shady at best.andM;If you do have a complaint after your product arrives (or doesn't arrive),try to resolve the problem with the seller.andP;  If that doesn't work, go back tothe agencies you called when you researched the company and contact yourlocal Better Business Bureau.andP;  These agencies place your complaint on fileand contact the seller to mediate.andP;  Although the agencies have no enforcementpower, they are occasionally successful in retrieving a consumer's money.andM;Also, send a written complaint to the Direct Marketing Associations, whichrepresents over 6,000 members and attempts to resolve disputes.andP;  Send a copyto the FTC's Enforcement Division.andP;  While the FTC doesn't intervene, theagency monitors complaints and establishes patterns of abuse that can spareother hapless consumers.andP;  Contacting your nearest Postal Inspection Serviceoffice may also prove helpful.andP;  In mail fraud cases, the Postal Service cantake civil action or refer the case to the U.S.andP;  Attorney General forcriminal action.andM;If you become unhappy with your purchase and the mail order company hasdisappeared, consumer agencies will attempt to locate the business owner andmediate.andP;  But if a company goes bankrupt, all you can do is make a claim infederal bankruptcy court.andM;While you can never be absolutely sure of a mail order company's solvency oreithics, most mail order nightmares can be avoided through diligent researchand informed credit card use.andP;  A little prudence before the purchase can helpyou find a true bargain.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
