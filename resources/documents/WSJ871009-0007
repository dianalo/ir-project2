The semiconductor maker agreed to purchase Fairchild from the French oil-services concern in late August. As previously reported, National Semiconductor's bid was chosen over a buy-out proposal from Fairchild's management. The management offer followed the collapse of earlier plans to sell 80% of the company to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., which drew heavy criticism from U.S. government officials.    Separately, Intergraph Corp. said it yesterday purchased Fairchild's Advanced Processor Division from National Semiconductor for &quot;less than $10 million.&quot; Intergraph's engineering workstations use the division's 32-bit microprocessors. But the Huntsville, Ala.-based computer-aided design systems concern said it intends to &quot;aggressively pursue&quot; the microprocessor market by selling the chips to other users, as well. </TEXT></DOC>
