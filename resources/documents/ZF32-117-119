(thoughts on licensing Apple's operatingsystem; how do Windows users react to the Mac)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Like a prizefighter who suddenly wakes up in the third round, Apple hasbelatedly come out swinging in the marketing battle of the GUI interfaces.andO;The company recently published a report by Ingram Labs comparing Macs withPCs running Windows.andP;  The results showed that you get more for your moneywith a Mac (for another interpretation, see John C. Dvorak's column thismonth).andM;Maybe Apple could have saved some money.andP;  Surely most of MacUser's readersknow at least one person who's bought Windows.andP;  Why not let the Windows userstry the real thing and see what they say? Speak Up: How do Windows usersreact when they try on Mac? * Send your thoughts to Dear Mr. Sculley, c/oMacUser, 950 TowerLane, 18th Floor, Foster City, CA 94404.andM;In April, we asked whether Apple should license its operating system.andP;  BrianHall, of San Francisco, California, thinks not.andP;  He bought a new LC - whichhe loves - at the price, he says, of &quot;numerous problems, hassles, andfrustrations ad infinitum with Apple Customer Support (!)/ Technical Service(?).&quot; After getting everything straightened out, he feels great relief atbeing &quot;freed from both the bonds of PC hell and Apple purgatory.andP;  EverythingI need now I can get f rom non-Apple vendors.&quot; But what has this got to dowith Apple licensing its operating system?

Smith, of North Richland Hills, Texas, sees things differently.andP;  Hedoesn't want to see a bunch of Mac clones on the market, Instead, he callsfor Apple to license application-specific versions of its operating system tomakers of consumer electronics.andP;  &quot;With the addition of sophisticated andcomplicated features to televisions, VCRs, and other office and homeappliances, it seems like the obvious place to implement the best human userinterface system available.&quot; He says that this would benefit users ofeverything from automated teller machines to microwave ovens.andP;  &quot;Let's get ridof all these ridiculous text-based menus, numeric keypads, and digital clocksthat constantly flash 12:00.&quot; Fine, but you'd better make sure there's aprogrammer's reset button on your microwave before your system bombs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
