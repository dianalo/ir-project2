Severalappeals were filed on the Forest Plan and EIS.Through language of the Congress Committee Report supporting the 1989 AppropriationsAct $8 million was appropriated to rehabilitate the South Fork Salmon RiverRoad to reduce sediment production and maintain vehicle access. Throughthis Act of Congress, the decision to convert 19 miles of the Road to atrail was set aside by the Regional Forester Stan Tixier on December 16,1988. The Payette Forest Supervisor was directed to conduct an environmentalanalysis for long term management of the road system to comply with theintent of Congress.Analysis will focus on reconstructing the road so it can remain open totraffic year around, while reducing sediment production from the road tothe greatest possible extent.The Road Project begins at the Warm Lake Highway and continues to the riversconfluence with the East Fork of the South Fork Salmon River, approximately33 miles. It includes the area from the river to the top of the cut slope.Preliminary alternatives are to pave the road using a variety of designstandards depending on the location, or to use a multi-surface treatmentusing a variety of design standards depending on the location. Snow plowingwill be considered with each alternative.Federal, State, and local agencies; potential users of the area; and otherindividuals or organizations who may be interested in, or affected by thedecision are invited to participate in the scoping process by sending commentson concerns or issues. This process will include:1. Identification of potential issues.2. Identification of issues to be analyzed in depth.3. Elimination of insignificant issues or those which can not be applieddue to the direction established, or through previous environmental review.4. Determination of potential cooperating agencies and assignment of responsibilities.The Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, will be invitedto participate as a cooperating agency to evaluate potential impacts onthreatened and endangered species habitat.Veto J. LaSalle, Payette Forest Supervisor and Dave Rittersbacher, BoiseForest Supervisor are the responsible officials.The analysis is expected to take about three months. A draft environmentalimpact statement will be filed with the Environmental Protection Agencyand be available for review in July. At that time the EPA will publisha notice of availability of the DEIS in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The comment period on the draft environmentalimpact statement would be 45 days from the date the EPA notice of availabilityappears in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The Final Environmental Impact Statement isscheduled to be completed by October.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Written comments and suggestions concerning the scope ofthe analysis must be received by April 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Submit written comments and suggestions concerning thescope of the analysis or issues and concerns to John Hooper, Project Leader,Payette National Forest, P.O.
