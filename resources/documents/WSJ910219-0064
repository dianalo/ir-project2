The moderate Komeito party, which holds the swing vote inthe upper house of the Diet, indicated it would back thefinancial package after LDP leaders Friday agreed to coverabout 40% of the contribution by trimming the budget fordefense and other expenditures.</LP><TEXT>   The deal follows weeks of sharp floor debate and politicaldealmaking behind the scenes. Failure to deliver on thegovernment's pledge to the Gulf effort would have severelytested U.S.-Japanese relations and would almost certainlyhave forced Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu out of office.   The government's preliminary plans had called forfinancing the entire contribution through one-year increasesin taxes on petroleum, corporations and cigarettes. Thatapproach was criticized by Komeito and the conservativeDemocratic Socialist Party. Now, in exchange for the budgetcuts, the leaders of those parties have agreed to someincrease in the petroleum and corporate levies. Since the LDPhas a majority in the lower house, passage in that chamberhasn't been in doubt.   Cabinet members on Friday also agreed to take a 10% paycut to help fend off taxpayers' complaints about being askedto help foot the Gulf bill.</TEXT></DOC>
