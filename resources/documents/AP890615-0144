By a 5-4 vote, the justices said states must give such men a``fair opportunity'' to seek visitation rights.   But by a separate 5-4 vote, they said states may deny men thechance to file a kind of ``reverse paternity'' lawsuit and obtain acourt declaration of fatherhood.   The court upheld California rulings that denied visitation rightsto a man, identified only as Michael H., who says he is the fatherof an 8-year-old girl, Victoria, born to a woman identified as CarolD. at a time when Carol D. was married to another man.   At issue was the constitutionality of a California law, similarto laws in many other states, that creates a conclusive presumptionof paternity in favor of a woman's husband if a child is conceivedand born during their marriage.   The California law has the effect of barring some other man fromobtaining a court declaration that he _ and not a woman's husband _is her child's biological father.   Four high court members said men in similar circumstances toMichael H. have no constitutional right to a court hearing.   Four justices voted to strike down the California law, sayingMichael H. has a constitutional right to prove his paternity incourt and seek vistitation rights.   Justice John Paul Stevens, casting the controlling ninth vote,said the California law is valid because it allowed Michael H. ``afair opportunity to show that he is Victoria's natural father, thathe had developed a relationship with her, and that her interestswould be served by granting him visitation rights.''   Stevens, saying he was willing to ``assume'' that Michael H. andothers in similar circumstances have a right to a judicial hearing,said the California law does not violate that right because MichaelH. received a chance to get visitation rights.   Stevens said the law does not have to give Michael H. a chance tohave himself declared the biological father.   ``Because I am convinced that the trial judge had the authorityunder state law both to hear Michael's plea for visitation rightsand to grant him such rights if Victoria's best interests sowarranted, I am satisfied that the California statutory scheme is(constitutional),'' Stevens said.   Carol D., an international model, married Gerald D., a topexecutive in a French oil company, in 1976.   The couple established a home in Playa del Rey, Calif., andVictoria was born in 1981.   Michael H., a neighbor with whom Carol D. had an affair, sued instate court in 1982, seeking to have himself declared Victoria'sfather. His lawsuit was dismissed.   In upholding the dismissal, a state appeals court said the statelaw presumption that Gerald D. is Victoria's father is based ``upona determination by the legislature as a matter of overriding socialpolicy that ... the husband is to be held responsible for the childand the integrity of the family unit should not be impugned.''   Michael H. said he had enjoyed a father-child relationship withVictoria for nearly a year, and that blood tests show abetter-than-98-percent chance Victoria is his biological daughter.   Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William H.Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy,wrote that Michael H. had no constitutional right to establishpaternity or seek visitation privileges.   ``Our traditions have protected the marital family against thesort of claim Michael asserts,'' Scalia wrote for the four.   But Justice William J. Brennan, joined by Justices Byron R.White, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun, said Michael H. hasa constitutional right to establish paternity and seek visitationprivileges.</TEXT></DOC>
