And that's just the beginning.    As the technology develops, so-called erasable optical disks will enable engineers to share their detailed drawings more easily, help banks to manage their documents better, let people store television clips together with text on a given subject, and pave the way for more sophisticated graphics.    Companies have discussed erasable optical technology for years, and some -- including Tandy Corp. and Sony Corp. -- have indicated they will bring products to market in the near future.    But industry executives say Maxtor Corp., a San Jose, Calif., maker of storage devices, plans to announce today the development of disk drives that mark a breakthrough in the technology. Although Maxtor declines to comment, the executives say the drives largely overcome the barriers that have made erasable optical devices much slower than magnetic disks, currently the most common storage medium. While widespread use of such products may still be years off, this advance is expected to give them a start in the market and get the ball rolling toward broad acceptance.    &quot;It's starting,&quot; says James N. Porter, president of Disk/Trend Inc., a market research firm in Mountain View, Calif. &quot;There's been smoke . . . for years, but no fire. Now we're starting to see some fire.&quot;    The devices that Maxtor is expected to announce, which are likely to be on the market in a few months, include a drive designed to handle a removable disk 3 1/2 inches in diameter -- the size that is becoming standard in personal computers -- that will hold 160 megabytes of information. That's enough for about 80,000 doublespaced typewritten pages, and is more than 200 times the capacity of a 720-kilobyte floppy disk, the biggest now in common use. The other drive is for 5 1/4-inch disks that will hold 500 megabytes on each side, enough for roughly 250,000 typewritten pages or an hour of video.    Erasable optical drives of this type use a laser to heat points on the disk, a process that stores information by changing the magnetic orientation of those points and thus the way they reflect light. The disks can be erased and reused a nearly limitless number of times.    By contrast, the recently announced Tandy technology relies on disks made of a polymer that becomes brittle after repeated use. The Tandy product, which isn't due on the market for about two years, is also apt to have a higher error rate, which wouldn't pose a problem in music reproduction but might in computer applications.    Despite the advances represented by the Maxtor drives, computer users and market researchers say erasable optical technology isn't likely to dominate the market for five to 10 years. Supporting hardware must be developed so that documents can be scanned into personal computers faster and more cheaply, and so that the computers can capture bits of video. Software must also be produced to organize the enormous amounts of data.    In addition, the Maxtor drives -- expected to cost about $1,000 for the 3 1/2-inch version and somewhat less than $3,000 for the 5 1/4-inch version -- still won't be as fast as the fastest magnetic drives, or as capacious as the biggest fixed-disk drives. The difficulty with speed has been in developing lasers that are powerful enough to record rapidly but light enough to move quickly across the disk. (Maxtor hasn't yet disclosed, and industry executives aren't sure, just how the company has dealt with this problem.)    Yet the huge amounts of money needed to leap these hurdles won't be spent until the market becomes large enough -- and trouble could, of course, develop along the way. &quot;We're still trying to find our way with the technology,&quot; says Larry Bacon, senior vice president for data processing at Travelers Corp., the Hartford, Conn., insurer.    Nevertheless, the early products seem likely to capture some niches. Government customers and defense contractors have expressed interest because the disks, which would contain sensitive information, can be easily removed and locked up at night. At the moment, many of those organizations put either the disk drives from their personal computers or the computers themselves in safes overnight.    Other customers say erasable optical disks will soon find their way onto the factory floor because they're more durable than magnetic storage devices. Many say they'll initially use the optical disks to make copies of information stored in other ways because the disks take up less space and are easier to handle.    DuWayne Peterson, executive vice president for data processing at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., says that his company now uses some unerasable optical disks for document storage, but that it also requires conventional drives for broader uses. He says that, depending on the cost and speed, he could see erasable optical drives taking over because they could handle both needs.    Those who worry about America's standing in the technology race are taking some solace in the fact that Maxtor, a U.S. company, has stolen a march in optical technology even though much of the early speculation had focused on the Japanese. &quot;I think this puts Maxtor firmly 12 months ahead of the competition,&quot; says Scott McCready, an analyst at CAP International Inc., a market research firm in Marshfield, Mass. </TEXT></DOC>
