Officials from Cambodia's Khmer People's National LiberationFront blamed the latest clashes on the failure of last month'sCambodian peace talks in Paris.   Thai military sources and relief workers said more than 20mortars fired by troops of Cambodia's Vietnamese-installedgovernment hit guerrilla positions near the Thai village of BanSangae, a mile from Site 2 refugee camp. No casualties were reported.   A Western relief official also reported heavy fighting near NongChan, 13 miles north of the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet.   ``United Nations and international relief workers were forced toevacuate Site 2 because of nearby fighting,'' a senior U.N. officialsaid.   More than 100 workers from international relief agencies work atthe camp of 140,000 Cambodians. It is the largest on the frontierand is administered by the Khmer Front and supplied by the UnitedNations.   Another Western official said access to the camp Thursday wouldbe restricted to essential medical staff.   On Tuesday, he said, one mortar landed inside the camp but didnot explode.   Abdul Gaffar, a senior Khmer Front official, said the fightinghas intensified because talks aimed at ending Cambodia's 20-year-oldconflict failed.   His organization is one of three guerrilla factions opposing thePhnom Penh government. A Khmer Front official at Site 2 said thefront received 27 truckloads of Chinese weapons and ammunition inthe past week.   The Paris talks ended without a political settlement largelybecause of Phnom Penh's refusal to include the radical communistKhmer Rouge in a future coalition government.   The Khmer Rouge, the most powerful opposition faction, killedhundreds of thousands of civilians in an attempt to build anagrarian society between 1975 and 1978.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, ousted the Khmer Rouge andinstalled a government. It has pledged to withdraw its troops fromCambodia by the end of September.   Gen. Manat Thinkulabute, the Thai military officer responsiblefor Trat and Chantaburi provinces where several Khmer Rougestrongholds are located, said he expects fiercer fighting along theborder in the next two to three months.   The guerrillas responded coolly this week to efforts byThailand's Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan to negotiate acease-fire, according to The Nation newspaper of Bangkok.   Chatichai met guerrilla leaders Monday and Tuesday and is to meetCambodia's premier, Hun Sen, in Bangkok at an unspecified date.   The Nation quoted Kraisak Choonhavan, Chatichai's son and one ofhis advisers, as saying the prime minister would continue efforts tobreak the deadlock.</TEXT></DOC>
