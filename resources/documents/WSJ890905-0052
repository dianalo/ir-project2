Approval of the bid, which values Lyphomed at $956.7 million, was expected. Fujisawa did, however, slightly sweeten its initial offer, made two weeks ago, of $31 a share.    The takeover is considered a harbinger of a move by Japan's largely domestic pharmaceutical makers to expand internationally through acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe. Analysts expect Japanese companies to focus on small and medium-size companies that can open new distribution systems for their products.    Fujisawa, which already owns a 30% stake in the Rosemont, Ill., concern, had been restricted by a 1986 standstill agreement from adding to its stake without board permission. Fujisawa will shortly begin a formal tender offer for the shares it doesn't own; the offer is subject to receiving tenders of enough shares to boost the company's stake to 66.7% on a fully diluted basis.    Reaching that level isn't expected to be a problem. Since Fujisawa floated its unsolicited proposal last month, no other suitor has stepped forward. In addition, Lyphomed's chairman, John N. Kapoor, has agreed to sell his roughly 14% stake to the Japanese concern.    Fujisawa's pricey bid -- representing a 42% premium to the closing price of Lyphomed shares the day before its offer was disclosed -- is designed to help the Osaka company diversify away from the antibiotics field, where the company's profit margins have been trimmed by heavy competition in Japan. One of Japan's leading makers of anti-ulcer, diabetic and hypertension drugs, Fujisawa had revenue of $1.46 billion in the year ended March 31. Lyphomed's sales skidded 26% to $127.9 million in 1988, as the company's problems with the Food and Drug Administration took their toll. Beginning in late 1987, Lyphomed ran afoul of regulators over quality-control and other matters, and it had to shut major plants temporarily. The stock, which had been a Wall Street favorite for several years on the strength of Lyphomed's rapid growth, tumbled as low as $8.625 in 1988, and as recently as January of this year it traded at $11.75.    Mr. Kapoor, who until recently held the additional titles of chief executive officer and president, led a small group that in 1981 purchased Lyphomed from Stone Container Corp. for about $2.8 million. He stands to receive about $134 million for his holdings under the offer.    It is his successor, Gary Nei, and the new management team he installed since coming aboard late last year, however, who are credited with engineering the company's rebound. As the long-running feud with regulators was resolved and operating results began to improve, the company's stock nearly doubled in the past seven months, even before Fujisawa announced its bid.    Nonetheless, a shareholder suit in Cook County Circuit Court seeks to block any sale of the company, calling the bid inadequate and contending that the price would have been substantially higher had the board not erected &quot;nearly insurmountable barriers&quot; to other potential bidders. The company won't comment on the allegations.    In over-the-counter trading Friday, Lyphomed climbed $1.375 to $31.375, on volume of more than 2.2 million shares. </TEXT></DOC>
