It wants to be the only macs in the world. The hamburger guys are suing Quality Inns for trying to call a new chain of motels McSleep Inns.    As someone named McCoy, I suppose I should be rooting for McDonald's to win. If I could use just the &quot;Coy&quot; part of my name, I and every other McCoy would be spared that awful question, always asked in a tone of spontaneous originality, &quot;Are you the real McCoy?&quot; But McReally, McDonald's, your McArrogance seems to have gone to your McHead.    Dear Diary:   Another quiet evening at home. Dinner was something made from a recipe my Mother cut out years ago from an old copy of Call's Magazine, aroni and kerel with bread crumbs on top. Not bad, although for my money there was a little too much kerel and not enough aroni.    After dinner we sat around nibbling on Intosh apples (they're great this year) and watching the tube. The Neil/Lehrer Newshour was good as usual. They had a long feature on political witch hunting in the post-Carthyism era and an interesting piece on Shakespeare-In-The-Park, which is staging a modern-dress version of &quot;Beth.&quot;    Neil/Lehrer was followed by some intellectual round table thing where everyone was spouting off about microcosms and rocosms. Robert Namara was one of the spoutees. I soon got bored with this and flipped over to ESPN and discovered Bob Adoo, who did so well with the Lakers a few years ago as a backup for Kareem, is still playing ball. I think the announcer said he was in Israel for the Cabee Games.    Around 9:30 I decided to give the tube a rest and got to wondering about corporate silliness and the potential for it to spread. Firestone might claim exclusive rights to the word &quot;fire.&quot; This could mean you'd have to call the Conflagration or Blaze Department should your house catch on you know what. Maybe the boys and girls at the Aandamp;P will sue to keep the rest of us from putting ampersands in our sentences, and we'll have to order ham-eggs in restaurants and scotch-sodas at bars.    What happens if A-1 Sauce goes to court seeking a ruling that no one else is entitled to use the number &quot;1&quot;? There will be 75,000 people at Ohio State some cold fall day chanting &quot;We're number hhhmmmm.&quot; And we'll live in a world where kids at school are taught that - - - are two even though it looks like three.    ---   Mr. McCoy is a writer in Rockville Centre, N.Y. </TEXT></DOC>
