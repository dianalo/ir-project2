The level of effort and duration of these activities inthe US has been greater than in any other country or continent, and therecan be little doubt that the development programs currently underwayin Europe and Japan are based on US technology. Most of the US developmentalactivities were begun long before the formation of the Department ofEnergy (or its predecessor Energy Research andamp; Development Agency), theElectric Power Research Institute, and the Gas Research Institute. TheNational Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Department of Defensewere the principal public sector R andamp; D sponsors in the nineteen sixties.However, there were a number of privately sponsored programs underwayas well aimed at many different applications, all of which contributedto the current technology base. This paper summarizes some of the earlyUS fuel cell R andamp; D programs and traces them to the present time. In addition,the near-term plans for public-sector sponsored R andamp; D are described.</TEXT></DOC>
