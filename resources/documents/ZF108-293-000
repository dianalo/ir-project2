otherwisethe kickers for the Js, it suggests will address major software issues thatare exercising its customers in areas such as office automation andtransaction processing performance, data centre management, hanging moreterminals off the things and improving networking - and likely the VSE/ESAversion of good old DOS/VSE too.andM;- o -andM;Carlton Communications Plc shares took another big hit yesterday, off 57.5pence at 615p on news that it had agreed to sell its Cosworth Holdings racingengine subsidiary to Vickers Plc for &quot;only&quot;

and, breaking all the rules about high-tech companiesconserving cash, it says it plans to buy in up to 2m of its shares in themarket; the company did not give any reason for spending its cash in thatway.andM;- o -andM;A research version of Concurrent C Release 1.0, a superset of C suitable forparallel programming, is now available from ATandamp;T Co's Unix SoftwareOperation: designed at ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories by Dr Narain Gehani and DrWilliam Roome, it is an upwards-compatible extension to C and C++, and isavailable in source code format at a promotional price of $700 until the endof July, when it will cost $1,000.andM;- o -andM;Thai communications: TIE/communications Inc is to sell its TIE Europe groupof companies to Chinteik Electronic System Ltd of Bangkok, Thailand for $20mand future royalties: under the agreement, TIE Europe will spread its wingsand market TIE/communications products in South-East Asia, Australasia, HogKong and China as well as Europe.andM;- o -andM;Gestetner Holdings Plc has announced that it has received acceptances inrespect of 94.45% of the 37,219,446 units of stock issued at 180 pence each:the rights issue followed the recent acquisition in the US by Gestetner ofNashua Corp's office sytems and supplies group for $151m cash (CI No 1,366).andM;- o -andM;Computer Sciences Corp is appealing the ruling that disqualified it from theaward of that $170m NASA contract for support services at Ames ResearchCentre in Northern California and awarded it to Sterling Software Inc (CI No1,393).andM;- o -andM;Sydney-based BICC Data Networks has won a contract worth $1.5m from theAustralian Department of Defence to install what will be BICC's first FibreDistributed Data Interface site in Australia: the installation will consistof two phases, with the site-wide network initially based around a BICC Hiwaybackbone - when the FDDI standards are fully ratified - probably sometimenext month - this will be replaced by the 100Mbps Isolan FDDI product, withthe various optical fibre-based Ethernet networks linked via eight Isolan toEthernet bridges.andM;- o -andM;Cyrix Corp, Richardson, Texas has complemented its plug-compatible but muchfaster alternatives for Intel Corp's 80X87 maths co-processors with one foruse with the 16-bit bus 80386SX: the FasMath 83S87 for the laptop andembedded controller markets is claimed to offer up to five times theperformance of Intel's 80387SX, to operate at one-twentieth the powerdissipation, and to be 100% software and pin-compatible with the 80386SX; thething draws less than 5mA when idling, and less than 40mA when operating in a16MHz system; the part achieves its superior performance by implementing itsfloating point primitive operations in hardware rather than in amicroprogrammed sequencer - and it evaluates elementary and transcendentalfunctions to higher accuracy than the 80387SX; fabricated in CMOS, the chipis offered in 16MHz and 20MHz versions and samples cost $506 and $556including a 3.5&quot; demonstration disk, user and installation manual.andM;- o -andM;The International Telecommunications Union, the United Nations agency thatdeals in worldwide telecommunications regulation and planning, has chosen tocelebrate its 125th anniversary by choosing &quot;Telecommunications andIndustrial Development&quot;
