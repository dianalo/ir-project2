And thesystem could bring some trading in U.S. stocks back from theLondon Stock Exchange. Nasdaq's arch-rival, the New YorkStock Exchange, will be forced to respond with its ownversion of an early-trading session if Nasdaq succeeds,traders say. Indeed, the Big Board already has a blueprintfor an early-hours session that officials expect will includetrading in big foreign stocks, as well as U.S. shares.   Interest, however, in Nasdaq International is likely tobuild slowly. &quot;I think it will be pretty much of achicken-and-an-egg situation,&quot; cautions NASD President JosephHardiman, who says he is under no illusions about how quicklythe system will take off. &quot;We've always said it will be veryslow out of the box.&quot;   Nasdaq International marks the first overseas expansion ofNasdaq, the NASD's electronic trading system for U.S.over-the-counter stocks. With 4,600 stocks, Nasdaq is alreadythe country's second-biggest stock market and the world'sfourth-largest.   Nasdaq International will start its trading with six U.S.and British brokerage firms that have offices in London; eachhas computer terminals there that will allow them to tradeU.S. stocks electronically over Nasdaq during London tradinghours.   Initially, trading on Nasdaq International will be limitedto about 100 of the largest U.S. OTC stocks and about 100 ofthe largest stocks listed on the Big Board, Mr. Hardimansays.   How will the system work? At Shearson Lehman BrothersInc., for example, customers in the U.S. and Europe will beable to call Shearson's office in London to conductearly-morning trades. Shearson tentatively plans to tradeonly about 20 large OTC stocks, including Microsoft Corp. andApple Computer Inc. &quot;It's a toe in the water,&quot; says MichaelBenson, Shearson's director of U.S. equities in London.   Currently, Shearson and other big U.S. brokerage firmshave no plans to answer phones at pre-dawn hours in the U.S.,unless demand for trading on Nasdaq International grows.   Other brokerage firms that will be trading on NasdaqInternational include Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Goldman Sachs andamp;Co., First Boston Corp., UBS Phillips andamp; Drew and Bernard L.Madoff Securities, a U.S. third-market dealer.   However, Nasdaq International faces a host of skeptics.Large investors in Britain and Europe worry that tradingvolume will be so light they won't be able to buy or selllarge blocks of stock; brokerage firms fret that they won'thave enough business to execute trades at competitive prices.   Discount broker Charles Schwab Corp. is leery of NasdaqInternational because of certain restrictions limiting whentraders can sell stock short, or borrow stock to sell inhopes of replacing it later at lower prices. Theserestrictions currently are under review by the Securities andExchange Commission, which approved Nasdaq International lastfall.   Nonetheless, interest among Schwab's U.S. customers inexpanded trading hours is strong enough that the SanFrancisco firm plans to offer tradings in U.S. stocks on theLondon exchange from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., says Schwab ExecutiveVice President Ron Readmond.   And Nasdaq International is intriguing such big investorsas Fidelity Investments, the Boston mutual fund group.   Alex Lamont, senior international trader for Fidelity,expects there will be some demand from Fidelity customers --particularly if major geopolitical news or news on anindividual company breaks before U.S. markets open. &quot;I couldsee us coming in and having someone call us at 8 a.m. or 7a.m., or even 4 a.m., and wanting to do something,&quot; he says.   One thing Mr. Lamont likes about Nasdaq International isthe greater information about stock prices. Investors whotrade U.S. stocks in London in other markets aren't requiredto publicly disclose trades.   On Nasdaq International, up-to-date stock prices will bequoted, although trading volume on each stock won't beavailable until the end of each early-morning session. That'smore information than has previously been available toinvestors who trade U.S. stocks outside of U.S. tradinghours, &quot;in the dark&quot; in London or on off-exchange systems.   &quot;Hopefully, Nasdaq International will provide us with somevisibility and some added comfort-level,&quot; says Mr. Lamont,who expects interest in the system to build slowly.   Interest, indeed, seems more keen in the U.S. than inEurope, where some large investors seem perfectly content totrade U.S. stocks during the few afternoon hours there whentrading overlaps with U.S. markets. &quot;We don't really need totrade after hours,&quot; says Thierry Carnal, a vice presidentwith Bank Brussels Lambert Switzerland in Geneva. Mr. Carnaladds that he can already invest in many big U.S. stocksthrough other vehicles, such as Swiss certificates traded inhis home country.   &quot;We've lived very well with the U.S. markets opening inthe afternoon,&quot; agrees Davina Walter, a director withLondon's Henderson Investment Management, which manages about$1.4 billion in U.S. stocks. She, too, is cautious. &quot;We needto feel that typically we can comfortably trade 20,000 sharesof a stock and be happy with the price,&quot; she says.   However, the powerful rally in small U.S. stocks thatcontinues this year may boost interest in the early-hourssystem. Henderson's Ms. Walter, for example, manages thefirm's American Smaller Company Trust, which rose 67% lastyear. She normally buys and sells her shares through regionalU.S. brokers, but says she might consider NasdaqInternational if trading is heavy. &quot;If the volume is thereand the prices are the best for our clients, I'm sure we'llparticipate,&quot; she says.   But with U.S. stocks at record highs, Shearson's Mr.Benson expects that Europeans won't participate heavilyunless the U.S. stock market falls sharply and offers them abuying opportunity.   Meanwhile, the Big Board is closely watching the NasdaqInternational launch. &quot;I know the Big Board is concerned,&quot;says Frank Massey, head of international equity trading inNew York for Shearson Lehman. &quot;They had two people in myoffice when I got back from vacation, wanting to know whatLehman was going to do.&quot;   William Donaldson, the Big Board's chairman, recentlyshrugged off questions about whether the system threatens theNew York exchange. &quot;We feel very strongly we have the mostefficient market,&quot; he said. &quot;The burden of proof is on anyonewho trades away from this market.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
