Invest in our children. Reinvest in America.''   ``There's nothing radical about his message,'' John White, theTexan who was chairman of the Democratic Party during the Carteradministration and now a Jackson supporter, said Wednesday. ``It'sneither liberal nor conservative. It's the core language of theDemocratic Party.''   But much of Jackson's platform is decidedly liberal and dovish.The candidate himself calls it ``the opposite of Reaganomics.''   He has promised a universal, comprehensive health program forall Americans, a goal of Democrats since Harry Truman.   He wants to double the budget for education and raise theminimum wage.   And he would pay for his social initiatives by raising taxes onthe rich and slashing Pentagon spending.   Jackson, who has finished first or second in most of theDemocratic presidential primaries and caucuses and is close behindMassachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the delegate chase, has casthimself as the candidate of the displaced farmer and factoryworker, the hungry and the homeless, and those who fear theirtoehold on financial security is precarious.   ``Economic violence haunts the lives of most Ameicans,'' Jacksonsaid in a policy paper.   ``There is nothing wrong with the American worker, the familyfarmer, or the small businessperson. There is something wrong withthe system.''   Jackson has called for a moratorium on family farm foreclosures;civil rights legislation to protect lesbians and gay men; tappingpublic pension funds to build housing, roads, mass transit andwater systems; debt relief and an ``international Marshall Plan''for the Third World; a national floor for welfare benefits; aphase-out of nuclear power; a freeze on nuclear weapons, and a haltto U.S. aid for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua and the UNITAinsurgents in Angola.   He claims he could cut the deficit by one-third by raising taxeson ``the richest 1 percent'' of Americans and on corporations.   Here are some of Jackson's key positions:</TEXT><HEAD>MIDDLE EAST</HEAD><TEXT>   Jackson says, ``U.S. policy in the Middle East is fatallyflawed. It is not working for Israel, for the Palestinians or forthe interests of the United States.''   He has called for an alternative policy that ``moves the processthat began at Camp David to the next progressive step.'' It wouldbe built on such principles as ``the right of Israel to exist (and)the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,including an independent state.''</TEXT><HEAD>HEALTH CARE</HEAD><TEXT>   Jackson says there should be a universal, comprehensive healthcare program for all, not just the elderly, ``no matter what theirincome.''   It would cover long-term care as well as services Medicare nowleaves uncovered, and it would be administered by the federalgovernment and ``paid for by earmarked health taxes and generalrevenues.''   Most hospitals and other institutions would remain private,providing services under contract with the federal government atregulated fees. By emphasizing prevention, it could actually becheaper than what Americans now pay, Jackson claims.</TEXT><HEAD>MILITARY</HEAD><TEXT>   Jackson calls himself ``a true peace candidate,'' and boaststhat he is the only Democrat who opposed Reagan's invasion ofGrenada and his bombing of Libya. He also favors ending the U.S.military build-up in the Persian Gulf.   He proposes to save $40 billion by not building two new aircraftcarrier task forces, and ``tens of billions of dollars'' bynegotiating further arms reductions with the Soviets.   He opposes building the Midgetman missile, the Stealth bomber,the Trident D-5 missile, or any more MX missiles. He opposesdeployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative, and wants to haltU.S. troop maneuvers in Honduras.</TEXT><HEAD>ECONOMY</HEAD><TEXT>   ``We must fight back against runaway corporations. Tax subsidieswhich aid U.S. corporations to invest abroad must be eliminated,''he said.   Jackson has proposed borrowing with federal guarantees 10percent of the $600 billion assets of public pension funds tocreate an American Investment Bank for development projects.   He says American business needs a new code of conduct, tougheranti-trust laws and tax incentives to invest in new plants andequipment. He would shift federal research and development fundsfrom the military to civilian uses, saying the United States is``making what the world isn't buying.''   Jackson would require advance warning of plant closures andmaking business pay ``a fair share of the costs of dislocation.''   He supports equal pay for jobs of comparable worth _ a key issuefor women _ and wants to raise the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage to$4.65 and then index it to the growth of average wages.</TEXT><HEAD>DRUGS</HEAD><TEXT>   Jackson's anti-drug crusade, the centerpiece of his campaign,calls for increased Coast Guard funding to stop the influx ofdrugs. He would offer drug-producing countries substitute crops toreplace drug crops and tie cooperation to trade and foreign policydecisions.</TEXT><HEAD>FARMS</HEAD><TEXT>   ``We need a moratorium on family farm foreclosures,'' saysJackson.   He would shift the focus of federal programs to family farmersand help producers of raw commodities ``band together to becometheir own processors'' and cut out the middlemen.   He charges that four corporations control 80 percent of thegrain trade, and five companies hold 58 percent of the beefindustry.</TEXT><HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD><TEXT>   Jackson would double the $21 billion federal education budget toboost aid for college students and provide ``full funding forcompensatory, bilingual and special education programs,'' as wellas Head Start, which now serves only a third of eligible children.</TEXT><HEAD>SOCIAL SECURITY</HEAD><TEXT>   Jackson would guarantee annual cost-of-living raises for SocialSecurity recipients and leave the program ``out of the budgetdebate (to) stop striking fear into the hearts of our seniors.''</TEXT></DOC>
