(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An 83-year-old man believed to havebecome disoriented while driving during a snowstorm strayed 40 milesfrom his destination and died, possibly from a heart attack.   The body of Henry Petrie of Golden Valley was found Wednesday inhis burned-out truck, which was in a ditch near the centralMinnesota city of Monticello, police said.   Petrie had been on his way to pick up his wife at work in St.Louis Park, seven miles from their home, during a storm that dumpedmore than 7 inches of snow Tuesday.   Authorities speculate Petrie, who had a heart ailment, becamedisoriented in the rush-hour storm, took the wrong route and had aheart attack, causing the vehicle to veer into a ditch.   One theory is that the truck's accelerator pedal stuck, causingthe tires to spin then heat to the point of catching fire.   The body was found about 13 hours after Petrie's wife, Delores,filed a missing-person report, said Golden Valley police Sgt. GaryQuarnstrom.</TEXT></DOC>
