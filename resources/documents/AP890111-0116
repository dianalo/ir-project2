SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's mushrooming Hispanic populationneeds increased education, job training and welfare assistance toblend effectively into American society, the authors of a new studysaid Wednesday.   Hispanics, while growing by 34 percent to 20 million in thisdecade, still lack an effective voice in society, according topopulation researchers Cary Davis and Rafael Valdivieso.   Policy makers need to find ways to ease the transition of Latinosinto American society, including bringing them into the economic andpolitical process, Valdivieso, vice president of theWashington-based Hispanic Policy Development Project, said at a newsconference.   In the past, new arrivals in America have had available thespringboard of low-skill jobs to help them get started in society,commented Davis, of the private Population Reference Bureau.   But U.S. society is moving away from industrial and other jobsthat often need little training, with available employment oftenrequiring higher education and skill levels, Davis said.   Thus, he explained, the ``ladder'' of jobs climbed by pastminority groups to make a place in society is being pulled from thegrasp of Hispanics.   ``National attention, we think, is required,'' said Davis inreleasing a study written by the two men. Entitled ``U.S. Hispanics:Challenging Issues for the 1990s,'' it is published by thePopulation Reference Bureau, an independent research group.   Hispanics will become the nation's largest minority sometime inthe next century, outnumbering blacks, if current population trendscontinue, explained Valdivieso.   And the fact that Hispanics have a younger age structure than therest of society means more of their numbers will be in the workforce at a time when large numbers of other Americans are retiring.   Valdivieso said programs are needed to help keep Hispanics inschool and to provide them with job training and assistance inmaking the transition from school to the job market.   Raising the minimum wage would be important, especially for youngcouples who are parents, said Valdivieso. And, for the same group,finding ways to provide medical assistance is a major consideration,he said.   He called for more English-language classes for immigrants, whilepreserving bilingual public services; more access to welfareprograms; efforts to reduce discrimination against Hispanics;programs to help Hispanics become more active politically andincreased corporate attention to Latinos as consumers and employees.</TEXT></DOC>
