The violations charged by the human rights group in its reportinclude execution of a mentally retarded man in the United Statesand killing of unarmed Afghan civilians by Soviet and governmenttroops.   Amnesty said the list of offenders for 1987 was the longest ithas published since the organization was founded in 1961.Amnesty,which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, recorded abuses last yearin more than 80 percent of the 159 U.N. member states.   But it said it was encouraged by the emergence of more than1,000 human rights groups in recent years and the proliferation oflaws to protect prisoners' rights.   It added: ``More than ever before in world history, governmentsare exposed to the glare of international publicity _ the greatestweapon we have.''   It said at least 760 political prisoners were executed in 39countries in 1987 but estimated the number probably was much higherbecause of secret executions. It also reported that governmentsused a variety of methods to deflect criticism, including deathsquads in Latin America.   The 278-page report said: ``In at least half the countries ofthe world, people are locked away for speaking their minds, oftenafter trials that are no more than a sham. In at least a third ofthe world's nations, men, women and even children are tortured. Inscores of countries, governments pursue their goals by kidnappingand murdering their own citizens.''   The report cited the United States, where 25 prisoners were putto death last year, for executing John Brogdon, a man diagnosed asmentally retarded. He was executed July 30, 1987, in the Louisianaelectric chair for raping, torturing, and murdering an 11-year-oldgirl.   The group also said ``substanstial doubts'' clouded theconviction of Edward Earl Johnson, who was executed inMississippi's gas chamber on May 20, 1987, for murdering a marshallin a small town.   Amnesty opposes the death penalty.   The report said the Soviet Union released 259 people, most ofthem prisoners of conscience. But it added that nearly 200 werepardoned under secret decrees that falsely implied they werecriminals and ``hid the fact that they had been unjustly imprisonedin the first place.''   Authorities held 300 other Soviet prisoners of conscience inprisons, in exile or in psychiatric hospitals, it said.   Soviet and Afghan troops, often in reprisal attacks againstanti-communist rebels, killed dozens of unarmed civilians inAfghanistan, the report said.   In China, more than 200 convicted criminals were put to deathfor offenses ranging from murder and rape to drug smuggling, theftand ``showing pornographic movies.'' But that figure representsonly a fraction of the total number of death sentences andexecutions, the report said.   Turkey, Czechoslovakia and East Germany closed channels ofinformation to hide violations, it said, and China, Haiti, Syriaand South Africa clamped down on the reporting of abuses by denyingprisoners access to lawyers or families.   It said the death from torture of a South Korea student, ParkChong-chol, in January 1987 sparked widespread protests thatresulted in the prosecutions of eight police officers and theresignation of government ministers.   ``Today, even one death can set off waves of anger and protestworldwide ... It doesn't always happen but it can,'' Amnesty said.   Among other abuses were the reported massacre by Sudanese forcesof hundreds of unarmed Dinka tribespeople, the summary execution byIraq of hundreds of unarmed Kurds, the disappearance of hundreds ofPeruvian farmers seized by government forces, and court-orderedexecutions South Africa and Iran.   The report cited politically motivated killings bypro-government assassins in Brazil, El Salvador and thePhilippines, as well as arbitrary arrests, torture and killings inSri Lanka, Afghanistan and Uganda.   In Western Europe, Spain was cited for torturing Basqueseparatist prisoners; Britain for failing to publish a policeinquiry into the killings of six unarmed Irish Republican Armyguerrillas in 1982; and France, Italy, Austria, Greece, Malta,Norway and Switzerland for jailing draft objectors.   In Israel, the report said, a court permitted the secret serviceto use ``a moderate measure of physical pressure'' in interrogatingsuspects.   Iran executed at least 158 people, although the true number wasprobably higher, it said.</TEXT></DOC>
