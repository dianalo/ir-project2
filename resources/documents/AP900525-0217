(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Campbell Soup Co. said today it plans tosell several of its European food units in an effort to focus onits more profitable businesses.   On the auction block are D. Lazzaroni andamp; C. SpA of Italy;Campbell Seafoods Division, which operates in the United Kingdomand Belgium; the vegetable division of Campbell Foods PLC inEngland; and Campbell Irish Foods Ltd. and Mallow Foods Ltd., bothof Ireland.   The latter three companies were acquired when Campbell took overFreshbake Foods Group PLC of Britain in 1988. Total sales of allthe businesses to be sold exceed $200 million, the company said.   Campbell, whose board of directors approved the divestiture onThursday, said it expected the sale to result in a $55 millioncharge against fourth quarter earnings.   ``The result will be a more focused European enterprisedelivering stronger operating profits along with superior returnsand cash generation,'' Campbell Chief Executive David W. Johnsonsaid in a statement.   He noted that Campbell is committed to ``rebuild the frozenconvenience food operation, which promises international synergyand long-term potential.''   Campbell has faced increasing problems over the past year andhas been frequently rumored as a takeover target because of itssluggish performance and depressed stock price. Some members of thefounding family have urged a sale of the entire company.   The firm has sought to remain independent by divestingunderperforming businesses and closing plants, cutting costs andlaying off hundreds of workers.   The companies to be divested have excellent positions in theirrespective markets that should make them attractive to a number ofprospective buyers, officials said.   Lazzaroni, based on Saronno, makes premium biscuits and seasonalcakes under the Lazzaroni and Borsari trademarks, but the unit hassuffered from operating losses.   The U.K. vegetable division has a 20 percent share of the frozengreen vegetable market in Britain, while Irish Foods holds a 42percent market share in Ireland. Its sister company, Mallow Foods,is a leading supplier of dehydrated vegetables, with a 25 percentshare of the European market in dried peas.</TEXT></DOC>
