No one minds pumping Bambi full of lead; the issue is whether to bring along the dogs as well as the Winchester.    Warming up a crowd in Commerce, Democratic state chairman Bob Slagle likens Vice President George Bush to that &quot;two-faced, mealy-mouthed crook&quot; Richard Nixon. Mr. Bush's state co-chairman, Tom Loeffler, refers to Democrat Michael Dukakis as &quot;Meltdown Mike,&quot; and warns the Massachusetts governor to stay north of the Red River. &quot;Texas is off limits,&quot; advises Mr. Loeffler. &quot;He doesn't fit.&quot;    Rep. Charles Wilson calls this campaign &quot;a battle for Texas' soul.&quot; Democrats haven't won the White House in this century without carrying the state. Conservative Democrats like Mr. Wilson see this campaign as a battle to prove the party's competitiveness here after a decade of Republican encroachment. &quot;If Bush wins,&quot; says GOP consultant Lance Tarrance, &quot;you will look back and say this was Pickett's last charge of the Tory Democrats.&quot;    Only California and New York have more electoral votes than Texas' 29, and in no state are the personal stakes higher for the candidates. For Mr. Dukakis, the outcome will determine the wisdom of choosing Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate. A loss for Mr. Bush in his adopted state would be humiliating.    Politically, this sprawling state is a trail head for diverse cultures reaching beyond its borders. Oil and gas interests run north from Houston toward Tulsa and the Rockies. East Texas mirrors the rural South. Mexican-Americans look beyond the Rio Grande and brush country to urban centers and the West.    A successful campaign must compete for each of these interests. The current Republican barrage is aimed at intimidating wavering Democrats, but after building a narrow lead, Mr. Bush's flag-waving campaign has yet to score a knockout blow to assure him victory. This month's drop in oil prices is a reminder of the state's still-troubled economy, and the vice president's years in Washington have made him a target of alienated voters here.    &quot;George Bush's most fundamental problem today is he is square in the middle of the bull's-eye of the Beltway,&quot; says David Hill, a Texas GOP pollster. Mr. Bush also is saddled with a vice presidential choice, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, whose qualifications and military service record remain a liability here. What Sen. Quayle did &quot;was OK, but he lied about it,&quot; says Bryan Cross, a Henderson mobile home salesman and a Democrat, who was seriously wounded in Vietnam days after Mr. Quayle joined the National Guard in 1969. &quot;He just started out lying.&quot;    As an outsider and an underdog, Mr. Dukakis is gambling that Sen. Bentsen will be able to blunt conservative attacks on the governor's defense credentials and give him access to boardrooms and rural courthouses. The Bentsen touch is behind the appearance of Ben Love, the Houston chairman of Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc., on a statewide campaign committee. In Nacogdoches, Democratic Mayor Judy McDonald is direct in stating her loyalties. &quot;My commitment to the ticket is to Lloyd Bentsen,&quot; she says.    Mr. Dukakis has invested top talent in building an organization, but he has yet to establish a rapport with voters here. His strongest class identity -- his immigrant past -- only accents his cultural foreignness in rural counties; his political style is more cool than country.    &quot;There's too much emphasis on his efficiency,&quot; says Otis Carroll, an East Texas Democratic county chairman. &quot;I want less on competence and more on confidence. I'm talking grit.&quot;    Two voting groups are the best barometers of the campaign: East Texans, and the Hispanics in the state's south and west. Each group makes up roughly an eighth of the state's electorate, and the groups are decidedly different in their outlook. Democrats like Sen. Bentsen win by running well among both groups. In recent elections, the GOP has made inroads among both blocs, and it will fight hard for their support this year.    Greater success among one constituency can offset losses in another, but as a rule the GOP must seek to keep the Democrats' white vote statewide as far below 40% as possible, while bringing its own share of the Hispanic vote above 30%. Mr. Bush faces erosion of his own base in Harris County surrounding Houston -- where Mr. Dukakis will compete for suburban independents -- and in the small oil and farm towns of West Texas. But East Texas remains the last, best reservoir of white, rural swing votes for Democrats, so the vice president has twice visited the region since August.    Radio ads of children reciting the pledge of allegiance heralded Mr. Bush's arrival at a recent stop in Tyler. Behind him on stage stood a virtually all-white drill team in cowgirl outfits. It gave no hint of the large black population in the surrounding county.    &quot;It's time to have someone who shares your values: hard work, family, faith, tolerance,&quot; Mr. Bush said. But tolerance is in short supply. A GOP oilman suddenly blurts out in an interview, &quot;I can't vote for that clam-eating Greek.&quot;    &quot;Texas values, Texas leadership&quot; is the Bush campaign slogan, but the focus is foremost on Mr. Dukakis. The Bush campaign has invested heavily in a new television ad in Texas devoted entirely to Mr. Dukakis's record on crime and prison furloughs. The ad fits a single-minded strategy to drive up his already high negatives in polls.    If West Texas' conservatism is like that of Barry Goldwater, East Texas' is closer to George Wallace. &quot;The wave of rural Republicanism is not spent yet,&quot; says Karl Rove, a direct-mail specialist known for no-holds-barred style. Mr. Rove relishes the prospect of the Rev. Jesse Jackson appearing in Texas on behalf of Mr. Dukakis, whom he dubs the preacher's &quot;soul brother.&quot; &quot;Where Jesse goes,&quot; he says, &quot;the truth is sure to follow&quot; -- in the form of Republican attacks.    Democrats try to counter the GOP barrage. &quot;This statement is a lie&quot; reads the headline of a Dukakis newspaper ad answering Republican charges on gun control. But the greater challenge for the Democrats is to shift the debate back to economic issues, with which the governor is more comfortable.    Texas faces what is expected to be a long and difficult recovery. Though unemployment has fallen to 6.8%, the state's banking system is riddled with failures. Some analysts believe oil prices could fall further -- at least in the short term -- before November. In East Texas, oil and gas producers have been wiped out, and the region's timber industry has felt the brunt of the slowdown in real estate. Tighter credit -- often blamed on federal &quot;regulators&quot; -- damps not only new investment but the Lone Star faith that an individual can make a fortune alone.    &quot;I'm not a flag-waving Democrat,&quot; says H.L. Richey, a Tyler oil and gas producer. &quot;I'm a former Republican who's going to vote for Dukakis.&quot; Michael Goodson has come to the same conclusion as an engineer on the Cotton Belt line which runs through East Texas to Arkansas. &quot;I just think we need a change,&quot; he says, looking back at his vote for Ronald Reagan in 1984. &quot;The railroad has suffered terribly in the last six years.&quot;    Speaking in Commerce, Mr. Dukakis casts himself as a champion of the &quot;real people.&quot; Though he borrows Sam Rayburn's words for the occasion, he can't fit the populist image of the late House speaker who chopped cotton as a boy in East Texas. In attacking Mr. Bush, he falls back on such phrases as &quot;McCarthyism.&quot;    The Dukakis television ads -- some of which were purposely filmed in Texas -- have met mixed success. One spot ends with the catchline, &quot;Who cares about your life? The choice is clear.&quot; But the viewer is distracted by the attention given federal plant-closing legislation -- an issue that is of less importance for most Texan blue-collar workers, who typically aren't employed in manufacturing plants.    By contrast, Mr. Dukakis appears more at home among Texas' large Hispanic population. After staying away from the voting booths in 1984, Mexican-Americans are expected to come out in significantly increased numbers this year. Both the governor and Mr. Bentsen speak Spanish, and in cities like Corpus Christi and San Antonio, Mr. Dukakis's immigrant heritage is celebrated. The Dukakis victory in Texas last Super Tuesday owed much to this same Hispanic support. And a little-noticed change in Texas law will make it easier to maximize this turnout through absentee ballots in the general election.    The change allows voters a two-week period prior to the election to cast their ballots whether they will be absent or not on Nov. 8. Both campaigns are mindful of the provision's potential, but the advantage should be with the Democrats. They are better financed than the GOP this year, and traditionally draw more from minority and elderly voters. Sen. Bentsen has quietly emerged as a financial angel for the bipartisan Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, and Andrew Hernandez, the project's president, says the Hispanic vote could jump by more than a third this year from 1984, to between 650,000 and 700,000.    Four years ago, President Reagan was projected to have won between 25% to 35% of the Hispanic vote. Mr. Bush must fight to repeat this performance. &quot;He's the only one who has Hispanic grandchildren,&quot; says Mr. Loeffler, somewhat defensively. James Shearer, the campaign's political director for Texas, takes a harder line. &quot;Hispanics will prefer to be told the truth in English rather than lied to in Spanish,&quot; he says.    Noting the state's stake in defense-related jobs, GOP Sen. Phil Gramm declares that &quot;300,000 Texans are in the freedom business,&quot; and Hispanics like Mr. Hernandez's own father -- now retired -- are among those who have found economic opportunity through the military. As in 1984, the GOP will invest in largely English-speaking television ads aimed at this more assimilated Hispanic voter. The initial thrust will be negative -- painting a grim portrait of the lives of Hispanics in older cities in Massachusetts. Lionel Sosa, a San Antonio consultant responsible for the ad campaign says: &quot;Hispanics have been told they are Democrats, but they are Republicans.&quot;    In the struggle for Mexican-Americans as well as rural whites, Sen. Bentsen's role is crucial. A product of South Texas, he helps anchor Mr. Dukakis's support among Hispanics; the well-financed advertising for his separate Senate re-election campaign emphasizes rural transportation and health care-issues aimed at the same rural and elderly voters needed by the national ticket.    As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, he also gives Mr. Dukakis an entree to the energy industry. Appearing together yesterday in Houston, Mr. Dukakis emphasized the role the Texan would play as chairman of a bipartisan &quot;summit&quot; on energy policy the governor has promised to call in January if elected. One issue at such a summit, the Dukakis campaign says, would be further decontrol of natural gas prices. While the candidate isn't talking specifics, he seeks to present himself as a willing partner -- from the North -- in selling change to consumers. &quot;Dukakis can do for oil and gas what Nixon did for China,&quot; says Austin oilman John Mobley, a close ally of Mr. Bentsen's and a past Reagan supporter. Mr. Bush, meanwhile, will bring his own &quot;stopper&quot; -- Mr. Reagan -- to Houston Thursday.    &quot;If Bentsen wasn't in the race, Texas would look like the rest of the South right now,&quot; which leans towards Mr. Bush, says Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater. If Mr. Dukakis's negative ratings in the polls can be kept in the 35%-40% range, Republicans calculate Mr. Bentsen can't save him.    Rather than engage Sen. Bentsen directly, the GOP quietly talks about him as part of a &quot;Texas&quot; ticket -- with Mr. Bush. This fits the state's ticket-splitting history but carries some risk. The senator's positive ratings have grown -- particularly in regard to Mr. Quayle. Sen. Bentsen has the financial resources to pull in voters and to fill the air with Senate ads on energy and jobs.    In the end, says conservative Democratic Rep. Wilson, &quot;this is going to be one cratered battlefield.&quot; He remembers working in the 1960 Kennedy-Johnson campaign in East Texas as a young man. Life was simpler then: There were fewer Republicans, and however foreign the Catholic Mr. Kennedy might have seemed, it was a clear enough issue that he could turn it to his advantage by facing down Protestant clergy in Houston.    If things are different today, the bottom line is the same. &quot;We're going to have to have the kind of October that Kennedy had in 1960,&quot; Mr. Wilson says. &quot;Very strong momentum and a surge.&quot;    ---                     Texas at a Glance    Population:              16.7 million --                             3rd in nation    Projected 1988           Whites 75%    voters, by race:         Hispanics 14%;                             Blacks 11%    Federal expenditures    for defense:             2nd in nation    Average expenditure    per pupil in public    schools:                 29th in nation    Physicians per    100,000 population:      32nd in nation    Labor force:             White collar 53%;                             Blue collar 32%    Unemployment:            6.8%    Manufacturing jobs    1980-1986:               -9.2%</TEXT></DOC>
