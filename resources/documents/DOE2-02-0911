<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-02-0911 </DOCNO><TEXT>A post reconstruction method of attenuation compensation for Single PhotonEmission Computed Tomography (SPECT) has been investigated that offersa new approach to the problem of quantitation. A modified correctionmatrix is generated for attenuation compensation in which the LinearAttenuation Coefficient (LAC) for each pixel is assigned a value dependingon the radial distance of the pixel from the true section boundary. Attenuationcompensation of transverse section images of small and large volume sourcesof Tc-99m in phantoms using this modified matrix indicated that a knownquantity of radionuclide could be determined to better than 10%. Thescatter fraction was estimated as the difference in the corrected sectionimages using a multiplicative matrix generated with a constant LAC foreach pixel and the modified matrix proposed in this paper.</TEXT></DOC>
