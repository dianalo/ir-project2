But the Department of Energy said the waste fuel shipment wasauthorized while the agency still had a policy of accepting theshipments.   The group, Greenpeace, said the secret radioactive shipmentviolates a six-month moratorium on reactor fuel shipments to theUnited States, imposed by DOE on Jan. 1 to assess environmentalrisks.   ``If it was too dangerous on Jan. 1, it is too dangerous on March1,'' Greenpeace spokesman Damon Moglen said in a statement from theorganization. ``At a time when the roof is falling in on the DOEweapons facilities, it should not bring more waste into the UnitedStates through the back door.''   The United States supplies Japan and several western Europeancountries with highly enriched uranium for civilian researchreactors. Until Dec. 31, in order to prevent weapons proliferation,it required that the waste fuel be returned.   DOE spokeswoman Chris Sankey said the department let that policyexpire so ``we could expand on an environmental assessment of ourfuel receipt policy'' at the Savannah River complex. She said thespent fuel left Japan on Nov. 26.   ``We will have no further shipments approved after Dec. 31.Anything not authorized before Dec. 31 will not proceed until wehave a new policy in effect,'' she said. She said she did not knowhow long the moratorium would last.   According to Greenpeace, the spent fuel is on board theBritish-owned Pacific Sandpiper and is due in Hampton Roads, Va.,after a two-week voyage from Britain. The waste ultimately is boundfor DOE's Savannah River nuclear weapons plant in Aiken, S.C., whereit will be reprocessed.   Moglen said Greenpeace will track the shipment to its destination``to let the communities along the route know what the DOE won't''tell them.   Safety and environmental problems at Savannah River last springled to the shutdown of the nation's only reactors that producetritium and plutonium. Safety and management at all 17 nuclearweapons facilities in the country have drawn severe criticism, andthe General Accounting Office has estimated it will take $155billion over three decades to clean up and modernize DOE's weaponscomplexes.</TEXT></DOC>
