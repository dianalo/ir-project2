Penhoet, Chiron'svice chairman and chief executive officer, said.   Merger of the two biotechnology companies in a stock swapvalued at $660 million was announced last July and iscurrently scheduled to be put to a special shareholder voteDec. 10.                                                                                                          But one condition of the merger has been tied up in court:the sale of Cetus's gene-amplification technology, or PCRtechnology, to a unit of Roche Holding Ltd. for $300 millionhas been challenged in court by Eastman Kodak Co. Eastmanasked the Delaware Chancery Court to enjoin the sale,claiming it retains broad rights to PCR technology under a1986 contract with Cetus. Cetus says it terminated thatcontract in 1989 when it licensed diagnostic rights to thetechnology to Hoffmann-La Roche of Nutley, N.J.   &quot;We expect a ruling {this} week in this regard,&quot; Dr.Penhoet said in an interview. If an injunction is granted,holding up the PCR sale, the merger will be delayed. But hesaid, &quot;If everything goes forward on Dec. 10, and the sale ofPCR to Roche takes place, then the merger will take place assoon as practicable. We'd anticipate consummating the dealaround Dec. 16 or 17.&quot;   Dr. Penhoet confirmed that Chiron expects to recordcharges exceeding $350 million in the acquisition of Cetus,and thus probably won't return to full-year profitabilityuntil 1993.   However, he said, &quot;The fundamentals of our business arevery much on track,&quot; especially Chiron's joint diagnosticsbusiness with the Ortho unit of Johnson andamp; Johnson, androyalties from its collaborative business with Novo-Nordiskof Denmark.   Before any merger-related charges, analysts currentlyexpect Chiron to post 1991 profit between 70 cents and $1.10a share. However the mean projection is for profit of $18.7million, or 97 cents a share, on revenue of roughly $96million. In 1990, the company earned $6.8 million, or 40cents a share, on revenue of $78.5 million.   Dr. Penhoet declined to comment specifically on theanalysts' outlook. &quot;It's a theoretical exercise because evenwithout the merger {charge} there would be expenses --printing costs, legal costs,&quot; -- related to the proposedbuy-out of Cetus, he noted.   He said Chiron research into an AIDS vaccine andbone-growth factor are both on track. He added that thecompany is also engaged in preclinical studies of a vaccineagainst Hepatitis C &quot;but we won't be ready to start clinicaltrials for about a year.&quot;</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
