The mercury hit 100 degrees in downtown Los Angeles at 1 p.m.,smashing the April 7 record of 88 set in 1904. Downtown had arecord-tying 100 Tuesday and record highs of 105 Wednesday and 106Thursday.   Other afternoon readings included 109 in Palm Springs, 101 inBurbank and Ontario, 102 in San Bernardino, 93 in San Diego, and80s and 90s statewide, including San Francisco and the San JoaquinValley.   An earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale hit SouthernCalifornia about 1 p.m. but the crowd on Huntington State Beach wasunmoved: ``It was kind of like, `We're out on the beach, you've hadan earthquake, don't bother us,''' said lifeguard Patrick Zuniga.   One of the most serious problems posed by the heat wave, causedby inland high pressure holding off ocean breezes, was lack of airconditioning in the huge UCLA Medical Center, where a Thursdaynight fire knocked out the cooling system. No injuries werereported and no patients had to be moved because of the fire.   The hospital shut its emergency room, canceled surgery andturned off hot lights. Fans were brought in and nurses gave bathsto keep the 462 patients in the 711-bed hospital cool. An insidethermometer read 86 degrees at 10:30 a.m. Friday, said spokesmanRich Elbaum.   The cooling system was repaired enough to work at 50 percentcapacity by 11 a.m. and was expected to bring patient wards down to72 degrees by early Saturday at the latest, said spokeswoman VickiBeck.   ``There were no major problems with patient care during the airconditioning outage,'' Ms. Beck said. The emergency room reopenedat 3 p.m. and surgeries were expected to be on schedule Saturday.   Thousands flocked to the coast to seek relief from thesweltering inland temperatures to swim in water that ranged from 61to 64 degrees _ but could only be reached after a trek acrossblistering sand.   Lifeguard Randy DeGregori, watching over some of the 60,000people crowded near the water on Santa Monica Beach, figured thesand was 10 or 15 degrees hotter than the air. ``People should wearshoes,'' he advised.   ``It's beautiful,'' said lifeguard Steve Voorhees at the southend of Santa Monica Bay. ``The only damper on the thing is the smogdown here.''   A smog alert was forecast Saturday in Los Angeles and east tothe San Gabriel and Pomona valleys and the Riverside and SanBernardino areas. The Air Quality Management District predicted``very unhealthful'' air in those areas after a week of record heat.   Elsewhere, the Sierra Nevada beckoned weekenders with daytimehighs in the 40s and 50s.   ``The weather is absolutely gorgeous,'' said Gary Shultz,general manager of the Mammoth Lakes Resort Association. ``Thesnowpack is still over 6 feet on the mountain and skiing is great.''   The National Weather Service predicted the beginning of acooling trend Saturday with the dissipation of the Santa Anaweather condition, which began with warm wind last weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
