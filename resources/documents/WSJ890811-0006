The issue involves emotions as well as dollars and cents. Looming in the background of talks at Nynex Corp., Bell Atlantic Corp. and Pacific Telesis Group are employees such as Greg Greene of Vacaville, Calif., whose eight-month-old daughter, Katherine, had surgery three months ago to patch a hole in her heart. An infection picked up in the hospital led to the removal of part of her sternum, and she may require costly reconstructive surgery as she grows.    Mr. Greene, who installs data circuits and special lines for Pacific Telesis's Pacific Bell unit, says Katherine's hospital bills totaled almost $100,000. &quot;Even if you're asked to pay just 10% of the total bill, it is a huge amount,&quot; he says.    Who should pay for increasing costs of health-care benefits is a vexing dilemma facing employers nationwide. &quot;It's an extremely emotional issue and therefore an extremely difficult bargaining issue,&quot; says Raymond Williams, the top negotiator for American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Corp.    Earlier this year, ATandamp;T went into labor talks determined to have workers pay a bigger share of its annual $1 billion in health costs. But because of fierce union resistance, ATandamp;T dropped the demand. It settled instead for an agreement to set up a network of &quot;preferred-provider&quot; doctors and hospitals that would presumably charge lower rates, without added cost to ATandamp;T's workers.    In a recent poll of 50 large corporations and 50 major union leaders, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. found that half of the labor leaders regard limiting what employers call health-cost sharing as a top contract priority, ahead of wages and other issues. About 38% of the executives, the top percentage, said their two biggest negotiating priorities this year are health-cost sharing and job security. And 90% of 400 employers surveyed recently by insurer NWNL Cos. said they plan to sharply restrict medical benefits for employee families by the year 2000.    The focus on health-care benefits isn't surprising. A survey by Noble Lowndes, a benefits consulting firm in East Orange, N.J., shows that employers' average medical insurance premium per worker jumped to $3,117 this year from $1,671 in 1985, rising nearly 25% this year alone. &quot;How would you like to compete with this albatross around your neck called runaway health-care costs?&quot; says Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca. &quot;For me, it's $700 a car, and still going up at twice the rate of inflation.&quot;    But unloading health-care costs on workers is hard, especially for unionized companies. &quot;While the companies might say going in that they need cost sharing, what comes out in the agreement is cost savings&quot; -- joint labor-management plans to contain doctor and hospital charges, says John Stepp, a Labor Department deputy undersecretary.    The health-benefits issue may cause still wider walkouts at Baby Bell companies. Strike deadlines come up tomorrow night against U S West Inc., Ameritech and Southwestern Bell Corp. The Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the same unions that negotiated with ATandamp;T, hope to quash further efforts to switch some health costs to employees. Some Baby Bell officials say ATandamp;T made cost sharing tougher by caving in.    At the Baby Bells, rank-and-file opposition to cost sharing is at least as adamant as it was at ATandamp;T. Eldon Finch, who repairs telephone cable and installs service for U S West in Tucson, Ariz., says medical bills for his wife, Janet, who suffers from lupus, topped $100,000 last year. His share exceeded $5,000, and he says he can't afford more. Because of such burdens, the unions &quot;absolutely and unequivocally&quot; won't allow cost sharing, says George Kohl, a communications workers' official.    The same attitude has prevailed in talks in other industries this year. The Steelworkers Union has staunchly resisted efforts by steel, aluminum and can companies to transfer more medical costs to employees. Bethlehem Steel Corp., for instance, wanted to set up a preferred-provider plan that union officials said might well exclude most workers, leaving them paying 20% of all their medical bills.    The union rejected that plan but agreed to consider one without the 20% burden for nonparticipants. &quot;A lot of our workers are living from paycheck to paycheck,&quot; so reduced health coverage would hit hard, says Patti Siehafer, benefits committee chairman for many Steelworkers talks.    With corporate profits improving, unions these days feel less compelled to give ground on health care, as some did during concessionary bargaining a few years ago. Railroads, unable to settle the matter in 1984 negotiations, this year proposed a &quot;comprehensive&quot; plan under which workers would pay part of any medical bill. &quot;We say, 'Nothing doing,'&quot; says Richard Kilroy, president of the Transportation Communications Union. He predicts a negotiating &quot;impasse&quot; over the issue.    Organized labor's success at resisting cost sharing partly reflects the fact that health benefits aren't only a pocketbook issue but an emotional one that threatens personal hardship. Making workers pay doctor bills that their employer had covered is, to them, &quot;stealing,&quot; says Richard Belous, an economist with the National Planning Association, a research group in Washington, D.C. So when the health burdens of the rank and file are brought into the bargaining, cost sharing often takes a back seat.    The pattern was set in the recent ATandamp;T talks. Going into the bargaining, ATandamp;T had decided that &quot;employees ought to share some of the costs,&quot; Mr. Williams, the company's top negotiator, said at the time. ATandamp;T wanted a $175-per-person deductible and proposed that employees pay a greater portion of medical expenses up to a $1,000 annual limit.    But the unions, seeing ATandamp;T as a trendsetter, &quot;didn't want to send a signal that workers' health-care benefits could be reduced,&quot; says Communications Workers Union President Morton Bahr.    In the end, the battle went beyond the corporate and labor negotiators to ATandamp;T workers such as Linda Kasinowski, who designs circuits at the company's Oakton, Va., regional headquarters. The younger of her two daughters, Katrina, now five years old, was diagnosed with leukemia in 1986. The family spends &quot;thousands of dollars&quot; on related health costs, the 39-year-old mother says. Her husband, able to work only from time to time as a carpenter, has his own medical expenses that often outstrip his income. &quot;I've often felt like I'm working just to pay doctors,&quot; Ms. Kasinowski says.    The unions devised several examples of the adverse effect of the company's proposed cost-sharing plan. For a surgical patient with a 13-day hospital stay, the worker's portion of the bill rose from $413 to $1,175. Union negotiators made it clear that rank-and-file workers, &quot;who have difficulty making ends meet, want no part of paying more for medical care,&quot; says Mr. Bahr.    Finally, on the last day before the contract was to expire, ATandamp;T acceded to the unions' cost-containment plan, centered on the preferred-provider network. &quot;What we have here is something that really helps contain costs without reaching to any extent&quot; into workers' pockets, says Harold W. Burlingame, ATandamp;T's senior vice president for human resources.    The two sides also opted for an approach that's gaining favor among unions and some employers alike: seeking to pass the buck to taxpayers. ATandamp;T and the unions agreed &quot;to mutually work to achieve prompt and lasting national solutions&quot; to climbing health-care costs -- meaning that they will lobby for some kind of national health plan.    Similar lobbying pacts have emerged from Bethlehem Steel and other steel companies. And rail unions are urging railroads to join in this &quot;obvious solution&quot; to the problem.    Companies and their workers, says Thomas Hickman, an electrical workers' negotiator, &quot;can't be expected to solve something at the bargaining table that we can't control.&quot;    ---@ Who Bears the Burden of Rising Health Costs? @ The Cost-Sharing Trend @ These percentages of companies pay: @ 100% hospital and surgical coverage @ 1988 26% @ 1986 33% @ 1984 54% @ 100% employer-paid premium for employee only @ 1988 57% @ 1986 60% @ 1984 62% @ 100% employee-paid premium for family coverage @ 1988 32% @ 1986 35% @ 1984 38%    Source: 1988 Hay/Huggins Benefits Report @ The High Price of Health @ AVERAGE MEDICAL INSURANCE @ PREMIUM FOR EMPLOYERS PERCENTAGE OF PAYROLL @ (PER EMPLOYEE) FOR MEDICAL INSURANCE @ 1989 $3,117 13.6% @ 1988 2,555 11.7 @ 1987 2,159 10.4 @ 1986 1,880 9.4 @ 1985 1,671 8.7 @ 1984 1,453 7.9    Source: Noble Lowndes </TEXT></DOC>
