His helmet lamp bobbed in the gloom as he jammed the metal jackback under rough-cut ceiling beams in the low tunnel in the heartof the Donetsk Basin, the largest Soviet coal field.   The miners more than a quarter-mile beneath Makeyevka weresmeared with black mud, their clothes soaked with water, theirlungs tormented with sickness and their hearts full of bitternesstoward the Communist Party and government.   A half-dozen miners lay down their tools to speak to an Americancorrespondent who had crawled 500 feet along a low tunnel to talkwith them and see their working conditions.   ``This is how we work,'' said a miner named Alexander, lying onhis side, using a broad-bladed shovel to ladle lumps of hard coalonto a conveyer belt, driven by chains that roared a few inchesfrom his nose.   A co-worker named Sergei lifted a drill and long bit to show howhe chipped away coal. He was stooped over, unable to sit upright inthe cramped tunnel. Both miners identified themselves only by firstnames.   Nine miles to the west of the Red Star lode, the First Congressof Soviet Miners passed resolutions of no confidence in the partyand threatened to strike July 11 if Prime Minister Nikolai I.Ryzhkov's government does not resign.   Another resolution expressed no confidence in the CommunistParty, presenting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev _ also the partygeneral Secretary _ with one of his toughest tests yet inmaintaining popular support.   Last summer, half of the nation's 1 million miners sent asimilar shock through the Soviet Union by striking for saferworking conditions, better housing and increased deliveries of meatand soap. Miners also demanded a greater voice in setting pricesand production quotas.   The miners say the government hasn't delivered, and they havelost faith in the party.   The miners meeting decided to reconvene in August to form thefirst independent nationally organized union since the days ofLenin.   Down in the Red Star mine, the workers said new unions wereneeded.   ``None of us are party members down here,'' Sergei said. ``Idon't know whether there will be a strike, but I'll take part ifthere is one.''   ``Food is the most important thing. Meat,'' Alexander said.   As the reporter crawled away, a pneumatic hose burst underneathhim, hissing filled the air and a miner rushed to fix it.   ``Don't worry. It's nothing,'' said Igor N. Shapovalov, deputychief engineer at the mine.   Shapovalov, 29, says he'll remain in the Communist Party despiteits unpopularity among the miners and the likelihood that it willsplit at a party meeting next month.   Despite his loyalty, Shapovalov said he supported the strikelast year, and he acknowledges that conditions in the mines arepoor.   ``Imagine. They sit in that water for six hours a day, in thatmoisture. They get sick all the time,'' said Shapovalov.   During the tour, he pointed out an improperly prepared cableused to haul trains along mine tunnels.   ``This should have a sheath,'' he said gesturing at an exposedcable loop that had not yet begun to fray.   ``And this should have a clasp,'' he said, pointing at the knotthat completed the loop. ``This could give way while miners were inthe train, and they could get hurt.''   He also demonstrated a gas meter, designed to detect dangerousconcentrations of methane.   Pockets of methane explode. Within the last two weeks, gasexplosions have killed six miners in Donetsk and 12 in the KuznetskCoal Basin in western Siberia.   In the last five months, 33 Soviet miners have perished, thenewspaper Trud reported Saturday. The death toll in both 1988 and1989 was 93.   On Friday, John J. Banovic, international secretary-treasurer ofthe United Mines Workers of America, told the miners' meeting thathis union would help them found an independent union and work toimprove conditions.   Listening to a description of the Red Star mine, he said: ``Itsounds like late 18th century or early 19th century mining to me.We'd close down a mine like that straight away.''   Shapovalov, a blond 6-footer, acknowledged his mine might closeif the government moves from a planned to a market economy.   ``If this mine closes, I'll find other work. We defeated theFascists. We can live through this,'' he said, evoking memories ofWorld War II, when the choices facing Soviet workers seemed muchsimpler.</TEXT></DOC>
