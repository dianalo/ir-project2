The complex plan calls for Calgary-based Nova and a subsidiary to pay an indicated 1.32 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.07 billion) in cash and stock for Polysar common shares other than those held by Nova. It also calls for redemption of about C$723 million of Polysar obligations.    Polysar said it will seek approval of the plan Friday from the Supreme Court of Ontario, and said it may take effect as early as Sept. 7. It said Polysar will be operated as an indirect subsidiary of Nova. Nova is acquiring Polysar's assets under Canadian regulations that require court approval.    The acquisition will turn Nova, which also operates natural gas pipelines, into a major petrochemicals concern. According to Nova, it will be the sixth largest in North America. Polysar and Nova reported combined 1987 revenue of C$5.19 billion, of which C$3.49 billion was from petrochemicals.    Under the plan, about 64 million Polysar common shares would each be exchanged for C$14.50 (US$11.73) and half of a Nova common share. Nova said this would increase the number of Nova shares outstanding to about 266 million on a fully diluted basis.    In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Nova closed at C$12.25, down 25 Canadian cents. Polysar closed at C$20.50, down 12.5 Canadian cents.    In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Nova closed at $10, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
