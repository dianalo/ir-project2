The justices announced on Friday that they will hold aspecial, hour-long argument on May 14, two weeks after thescheduled end of oral arguments for the term, to consider theconstitutionality of the flag law passed last year byCongress. A decision in the case is expected in late June orearly July.</LP><TEXT>   A recent vote in the House demonstrates the strongpassions the case has stirred. By a 309-101 vote, the Housewithdrew a brief filed in the Supreme Court by House counselSteven Ross. The brief urged the court to hear the case anduphold the law. But the hot point of contention was thetiming of Supreme Court review.   When it passed the law, Congress included a provisioncalling for expedited review by the high court. Based on thatprovision, after federal judges in Seattle and the Districtof Columbia declared the law unconstitutional, the Bushadministration on March 14 urged the high court to put theappeal on a fast track for argument this month -- even thoughthe usual deadline for April hearings had passed.   In contrast, the House brief had said Congress simplymeant that the court should &quot;give the case priority when itdevises its argument calendar for October.&quot;   House Republican leaders provoked the vote to withdraw thebrief, complaining that they weren't consulted on it, andfocusing on the brief's suggestion that there was no need forthe high court to rush to hear the case this spring.   The vote came to be seen as an election-year test oflawmakers' commitment to protecting the flag. The issue, saidRep. James Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.), was whether the Housewould &quot;leave that flag unprotected for a longer period oftime, maybe all summer, maybe till after the election.&quot;   After the House vote, Mr. Ross and Democratic leaders metwith the Republicans; the next day, the brief was refiled,but the discussion of how quickly the case should be decidedwas deleted.   Democratic leaders insisted they hadn't been trying todelay Supreme Court action until after the November election.The suggestion in the brief for a routine schedule, ratherthan a fast track, was to give the lawyers ample time toresearch the case, they said.   Rep. Craig Washington (D., Texas), said that the Novemberelection had nothing to do with the issue, &quot;except someonewants to use it for political purposes.&quot;   Ever since the high court struck down a Texasflag-desecration law last June, the question of how toprotect the flag has been a tough one for Democrats. MostDemocratic lawmakers pushed for the new federal law in thehope that it would be upheld by the Supreme Court and therewould be no need for a constitutional amendment favored bymany Republicans.   If the Supreme Court now strikes down the federal law,Democrats will find it difficult to oppose a constitutionalamendment, especially a few months before the Novembercongressional elections.</TEXT></DOC>
