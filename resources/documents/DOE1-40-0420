Thestudy examines the technical feasibility of a renewable energy future,this economic viability, what it would look like, and what would needto be done in order to try for such a future. In particular, it was attemptedto examine these points in the context of the assumption that no radicalchanges in lifestyles or values took place; in other words, primarilyan economic fix analysis. The results of this study can be summarizedas follows: under conditions of strong economic growth (an increase ofmore than 200% in Gross Domestic Product) and moderate population growth(an increase of over 50%), it would be technically feasible and cost-effectiveto operate the Canadian economy in 2025 with 12% less energy than itrequires today, and, over the same 47 year period, to shift from 16%reliance on renewable sources to 77%. In addition, should the economygrow by 140% to 2025 (with the same population growth), and should thesoft technologies drop slightly, it would be feasible and cost-effectiveto use 34% less energy in 2025 than in 1978, with 82% of that energyprovided by renewable sources.
