Jan. 31   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on pay raises for retired federaljudges:   The federal judiciary badly needs its senior judges _ judges who... choose to stay actively at work after reaching retirement age.But what the judiciary doesn't need are senior judges, like formerChief Justice Warren E. Burger, who continue to draw full salary fordoing nothing. ...   An estimated 20 percent of all senior judges, including Burger,continue to draw full salary while doing no work. Their idleness isenriching _ to them, not us.   In Burger's case, he receives $115,000 a year. That salary is dueto rise to $175,000 (in February) unless Congress disapproves. Hadhe retired when he left the court in 1986, his pension would be$108,400.   Burger's record of all play and no work since he took seniorstatus will dampen public enthusiasm for a pay increase. That'sunfortuanate; a pay boost is badly needed. ...   Burger and other senior judges who draw full pay for doingnothing should be required to retire. After all, if they refuse towork, why should we pay them?</TEXT><TEXT>   Jan. 30   Carlsbad (N.M.) Current-Argus on congressional pay raises:   Is it any wonder that the American people have a general distastefor politics and politicians? It is a two-way street. Politicianshold us in low esteem, they figure us for suckers.   Case in point, of course, is the pay raise House and Senatemembers are about to accept. Here's the line they expect us toswallow: They really don't want this money, they really don't, andgosh darned it, if there was any way they could stop it, well, bygolly, they sure would.   Hey, guys, in the words of a famous philosopher, sit on it. We'renot buying anymore. We've been through it before. Remember 1987? TheSenate voted 88 to 6 against a $12,000 increase. The House followedsuit, haranguing against this needless salary boost, and rejectingit in a voice vote.   However, by golly, all of this humble breast-beating took placeafter the raises were already in effect and it was too late toreject them.   Shucks. They meant well.</TEXT><TEXT>   Jan. 30   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on the Equal Rights Amendment:   The past year, although far from top-notch, produced some notablegains for women.   And an even bigger gain _ real hope for the Equal RightsAmendment _ is not unrealistic now with a new president in the WhiteHouse. ...   We believe (George) Bush's rise from vice president to chiefexecutive also gives women and their male supporters an opportunity.As a congressman, Bush supported the ERA.   Largely for that reason, we don't think leaders of nationalwomen's groups should write off the ERA as a long-term goal, as somehave done.   Passage should be pursued now.</TEXT><TEXT>   Jan. 27   The Seattle Times on the border ditch:   Waging war against drugs and illegal immigration with a four-miledrainage ditch on the U.S.-Mexican border is an act of desperation,with an improbable chance of success.   History suggests that fortified barriers seldom stop invadingarmies, or discourage determined people in pursuit of economic orpolitical freedom. ...   A Tex-Mex version of a Maginot Line will not deter desperatepeople who think a better life awaits them. The only way to tarnishthe gilded dreams about the United States is to take away the jobsthat attract economic refugees.   Continued immigration reform and enforcement that puts a premiumon punishing exploitive employers in inner cities, on the farm orthe forests, attacks part of the problem.   On a higher political plane, the U.S. and Mexico should exploreinvestment and free-trade agreements that create job opportunitiesin Mexico. Both countries could benefit.   Securing our borders with a ``buried Berlin Wall'' is not whatthis country is all about.</TEXT><TEXT>   Jan. 26   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on the Supreme Court's rejection ofquotas:   After years of unsuccessful pleading by the Reaganadministration, the U.S. Supreme Court limited the right of stateand local governments to impose quotas to undo past racialdiscrimination.   The ruling, which invalidates a Richmond, Va., ordinance settingaside 30 percent of the city's construction business forminority-owned businesses, threatens hundreds of affirmative actionprograms.   In the Richmond case, the court was unimpressed that onlytwo-thirds of 1 percent of the city's construction contracts hadbeen given to minority-owned business in the past five years. ...That's a telling figure that shows obvious discrimination. Richmondis 50 percent black.   The court worries that such plans could breed the kind ofdiscrimination once embodied in Jim Crow segregation laws, or quotasthat limited the number of Jews at colleges. The fear is unfounded.   In one case, the main _ and only _ rationale is hatred and bias.In the other, it's an honest attempt to correct the systematicexclusion of black and other minority group members from jobs andpublic contracts. The Richmond pattern should be clear.   President Reagan's appointees to the court have joined inrebuking Richmond. That's a message that will be heard in city hallsand statehouses across the country, and it's the wrong one to send.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
