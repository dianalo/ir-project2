The bud, killed by last month's freeze, disintegrates.   &quot;On some of the Merlot vines, we've lost both the firstbud and the secondary bud,&quot; laments Mr. Chanfreau, whosefamily owns the Chateau Fonreaud vineyard here. &quot;Ourproduction this year will be a fraction of a normal year --maybe one-quarter, maybe less.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   France's April freeze, which killed millions of grape budsacross the country and will limit 1991 wine production,sounds like a disaster. But Mr. Chanfreau isn't so sure.   &quot;It will be at least another year before I know,&quot; theyoung winemaker says. &quot;It could be a disaster, or it couldturn out to be a good thing for me.&quot;   A good thing? No one said winemaking was a simple affair,and the April freeze seems destined to prove the point.Winemakers here in the Bordeaux region point out that theyare dealing not just with the weather, but also with markets,and those can be as tough as Mother Nature.   Before the freeze, producers were tearing their hairbecause of too much production. High quality and generallyabundant harvests in 1988, 1989 and 1990 produced a lake ofunsold wine. Some of the lesser-quality 1987 vintage stillawaits buyers in producers' cellars. Consumers, frightened bythe world recession and the Mideast war, have cut purchasesand prices have been slumping. That was good news for buyersbut terrible news for producers.   &quot;One retailer who took 2,000 cases last year said hewanted just 1,200 this year,&quot; says Mr. Chanfreau. &quot;He askedme to set aside another 800 in case he wanted to buy themlater. That will be fine if he does buy, because the priceprobably will be higher. But if he doesn't buy, then. . . .&quot;   The freeze may have changed that calculation. Although the1991 wine itself won't even be in bottles for another twoyears or so, some will be sold in advance and expectationswill influence current prices.   The freeze, which affected much of France, destroyedmillions of baby grapes just as they were budding.   From Pomerol to Saint Emilion to Medoc, 1991 Bordeauxproduction could easily be cut in half. Other regionsincluding the Loire, Bourgogne and Beaujolais country alsoare suffering. Only a few naturally protected vineyardsescaped.   Actual 1991 production levels depend on summer weather,but they are almost certain to be well below normal. If so,some of the unsold lake could be mopped up and prices couldstop falling -- good news for producers, bad news for buyers.   For some producers, the real risk could come in 1992.Another poor year then could strain the finances of some ofthe weaker, more heavily indebted producers, who would sufferfrom lost sales volumes. But if 1992 is good, then the freezewill be remembered by many as a good regulator, which keptprices from plummeting.   Bernadette Villars, who owns and runs ChateauChasse-Spleen in the village of Moulis, as well as two otherchateaux in Pauillac and Margaux, is taking the whole thingphilosophically.   &quot;We're dealing with nature here,&quot; she says, gazing at herown frozen grape buds. &quot;You can't expect consistency. We havehad three very good years in a row, and I can't remember thelast time that happened. You have to accept some bad years.&quot;   Driving past the village of Saint Julien, on the way toher property in Pauillac, she points out one of the greatinjustices of the freeze. On the right side of the road,toward the Gironde River, the vines are radiant, bristlingalmost normally with green leaves. Protected by the river'swarmth, most buds didn't freeze. But on the left side of theroad, just a few yards farther from the river, vines arestarkly black.   &quot;Not a very democratic business, winemaking,&quot; muses Mrs.Villars. &quot;The oldtimers like to say that you can't producegreat wine in the Medoc unless you can see the river. And infact, most of the best-classed Bordeaux chateaux are near theGironde. I never fully understood that saying about the riveruntil now. Obviously, the river has helped prevent frostsdown through the ages.&quot;   Chateau Haut-Brion and Chateau Petrus, two of thebest-known in the Bordeaux region, called in helicopters tofan the air during the freeze period, which may be one reasonwhy both saved a large percentage of their buds.   Chateau Margaux uses a complicated sprinkler system toprotect its white-wine grapes from freezes. When thetemperature falls below freezing, the sprinkler comes on,covering shoots with ice and keeping them at freezingtemperature. Since the buds freeze at temperatures below thatof ice, they are protected -- if the system works.</TEXT></DOC>
