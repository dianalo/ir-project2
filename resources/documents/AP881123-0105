OATIS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   With storms lashing the West and the Southeast and air faresclimbing today, many Americans headed home early for Thanksgiving toget a jump on the busiest travel day of the year, and officialsbraced for millions more.   ``Everybody here knows it's going to be extra busy around thistime, so we put some extra people on,'' said Debra Ingram, aspokeswoman at Newark (N.J.) International Airport, where trafficwas heavy Tuesday. ``Other than that, we just pray a lot.''   The Western storm howled into Oregon with 75 mph winds and dumpedheavy rain on northern California on Tuesday, delaying San Franciscoflights up to two hours, causing officials in New York to holddepartures for that city and snarling commuter traffic.   Four Trees, Calif., in the northern Sierra Nevada, received nineinches of rain in the 24 hours ending at 4 a.m. The rain wasexpected to continue through tonight.   In the East, Tropical Storm Keith hit Florida's west coast todaywith 65 mph winds and heavy rain.   Officials at major Florida airports did not expect the foulweather to affect holiday travel. ``We anticipate the airplanes willbe able to slip by the storm on the side or fly over it,'' said FortLauderdale-Hollywood International Airport spokesman Jim Reynolds.   The Western storm was expected to dump as much as 36 inches ofsnow in the Sierra Nevada, including up to 18 inches around LakeTahoe, and leave heavy snow in most mountain areas of the West as itspread to the northern Plains today. Wind gusts of more than 50 mphwere reported overnight in Redding, Calif.   ``We've got about an inch (of snow) already,'' Trudy England, whoruns England's Lodging in Government Gamp, Ore., about five milessouth of Mount Hood, said Tuesday night. ``It's cold and snowingsteadily, so we expect more.''   Eight inches of snow fell overnight at Stampede Pass in theSnoqualmie National Forest of central Washington.   Motorists in parts of the West were urged to check travelconditions before setting out on long Thanksgiving journeys or toprepare for mid-winter driving.   Nationally, authorities were braced for a holiday jam ofmotorists today. The Highway Patrol planned a ``turkey watch'' inthe desert outside Los Angeles for those violating speed, safetybelt and other traffic laws.   The National Safety Council said 450 to 550 people may die intraffic accidents between 6 p.m. Wednesday and midnight Sunday.During a non-holiday, four-day weekend, about 390 people couldexpect to be killed. Last year, 494 people died during Thanksgivingweekend.   For air travelers, the cost of flying went up at midnight Tuesday.   The nation's biggest airlines went ahead with plans announcedlast week to boost their lowest discount air fares and eliminatecheap fares that can be booked a few days in advance. Among thosemaking the changes were United Airlines, American Airlines,Northwest Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Delta Air Lines.   The new fares were not expected to affect the volume ofThanksgiving travel, Delta spokesman Bill Berry said at thecarrier's Atlanta headquarters.   ``Those fares going into effect require advance purchase, so theywill be for later travel,'' Berry said. ``The people traveling thisweekend made their reservations some time ago.''   Officials prepared for a flood of fliers.   More than 200,000 passengers today were expected to pass throughthe nation's busiest airport, Chicago's O'Hare International. On anormal day, 120,000 to 150,000 use the airport. The Chicago TransitAuthority planned longer trains and more fare handlers for ridesfrom downtown to O'Hare.   At Boston's Logan International Airport, 78,000 travelers wereexpected, an increase of 30 percent from the normal number. TheMassachusetts Port Authority planned extra buses, vans and watershuttles and urged fliers to ride instead of drive to Logan tominimize airport traffic jams.   At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, about 136,000passengers were anticipated, up from 105,000 normally.   At Newark International on Tuesday night, Zelder Hillard,arriving from Charlotte, N.C., to visit relatives in Paterson, N.J.,said 35 people couldn't make her flight from North Carolina becauseof the crush of travel.   Ms. Hillard said Piedmont Airlines offered passengers a freeround-trip ticket anywhere in the United States if they would giveup their seats.   ``Most of the people seemed to want to get home,'' Ms. Hillard,20, said. ``Only about three or four people gave up their seats.''</TEXT></DOC>
