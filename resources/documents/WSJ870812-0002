StevensStaff Reporter of the Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN CANDA FRESTMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar advanced in brisk foreign exchange dealings Tuesday and briefly traded above the important psychological barrier of 1.90 West German marks, before retreating slightly.    In doing so, the U.S. currency continued a new trend in which it climbs to recent highs early in the day only to fall back later under selling pressure.    Yesterday may have been the first day in the past week in which the selling pressure on the dollar didn't come from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the West German Bundesbank. Although central bank intervention was initially rumored in the market when the dollar retreated from its intraday highs Tuesday, bank traders said one or two large commercial sell orders were responsible for the afternoon decline.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8942 marks, up from 1.8924 Monday, but down from its intraday high of 1.9030 shortly after noon.    When the large sell orders for dollars hit the typically thin, afternoon New York market, the U.S. currency reacted swiftly. Less than an hour after reaching its intraday high, the dollar traded at 1.8950 marks.    &quot;People were jumping over each other to get out&quot; of dollars, Samuel F. Lek, a trader at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., New York, said.    In other trading, the dollar firmed to 151.14 Japanese yen, from 151.02.    A trader familiar with the transactions said a major New York bank sold $300 million against the Japanese yen near the dollar's intraday high of 151.83 yen. The trader said the size of the sell order, which the bank parceled out to several other banks, led some market participants to believe a central bank was behind the deals.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 151.45 yen.    Acrophobia spooked some traders as the dollar crept beyond 1.90 marks, a level not seen since the middle of January, when the dollar was plunging.    Traders also began questioning a factor responsible for much of the dollar's recent gains: political tension in the Persian Gulf.    Since the U.S. flagging and Navy escort of Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf raised fears of a military conflict with Iran, the dollar has been bought as a safe haven for investment. A widening of the Iran-Iraq war, it was reasoned, would threaten world oil supplies and punish many Western economies more than the U.S.    Concerns about the Mideast continue to underpin the dollar's value, but some traders say it's a diminishing factor in the market as time passes without a major showdown occurring. &quot;It's no longer an immediate factor of whether to buy dollars or sell dollars,&quot; Robert K. Ryan, vice president of foreign exchange at Irving Trust Co., New York, said. &quot;It seems to be an excuse, rather than a reason&quot; for buying, he added.    Betsy Hoy, a trader at Chemical Bank, New York, said anyone who bought dollars expecting a major flare-up in the Persian Gulf region is &quot;getting awfully bored right now.&quot; She added, &quot;some investors might be willing to take profits.&quot;    Traders also note that the adversaries have passed up several opportunities to escalate the conflict in the region. So far this week another tanker struck a mine in waters near the gulf, and a U.S. warplane was reported to have fired on an Iranian fighter over the weekend, but missed. A week earlier hundreds of rioting Iranian pilgrims were killed in Mecca by Saudi police.    &quot;We've weathered quite a few storms in the Middle East with no significant avail,&quot; Ms. Hoy said.    At the same time, traders continue to follow events there very closely. &quot;There isn't going to be a sudden outbreak of peace. That, if it comes, will come slowly,&quot; said Mr. Lek of Bear Stearns. &quot;If one ship gets out of the Persian Gulf safe, that doesn't mean its over. The next ship could blow up,&quot; he added.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $3.80 an ounce to $464.20 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 3.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $465.45 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                     Late New York Trading               Tuesday, Aug. 11, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
