The investor, who asked not to be identified, put $5,000 in 1983 into Polaris Aircraft Investors IIb, which aimed to provide both tax benefits and inflation protection by purchasing aircraft, leasing them to corporate users and selling them after 10 years.    This limited partnership was sold by brokers at Prudential-Bache, a Prudential Insurance unit, and is managed by Polaris Aircraft Leasing Corp., a San Francisco concern that is 80%-owned by General Electric's GE Credit operation.    Unfortunately, the market for corporate aircraft has since weakened drastically because many of the biggest users, oil companies, curbed their far-flung exploration efforts after oil prices peaked.    Marc Desautels, a Polaris executive vice president, said the partnership raised $10.5 million from investors. That money, plus $8.3 million in borrowed funds, was used to buy five planes and a helicopter.    The loan was renegotiated in 1986 after Polaris was unable to keep the planes leased, as required. Polaris kept paying a reduced debt service of $100,000 a month out of cash reserves for 10 months, hoping to re-lease the aircraft.    But on Feb. 10, Polaris informed investors that the bank had asked that the aircraft be sold and proceeds used to repay the loan. &quot;Cash, if any, remaining after payment of the related aircraft debt and partnership expense will be promptly distributed,&quot; according to a letter to the limited partners.    So far, each investor who put $10,000 into the partnership has received an investment tax credit of $1,650, which is a straight tax cut; deductions from taxable income totaling $3,379, and cash distributions totaling $1,247, according to Polaris.    Mr. Desautels said investors may have to return part of the tax credit because of the early aircraft sale. But Polaris believes the market value of the planes exceeds the $5.9 million loan balance. If so, the investors still might receive more cash. If sale proceeds don't equal the loan balance, Mr. Desautels said, the investors won't be on the hook for the difference because the loan is non-recourse.    This partnership, he said, is atypical for Polaris, which has raised $660 million in 13 years, $250 million in 1986 alone. Most of its financings have been on commercial aircraft, which haven't suffered the same sharp market change as corporate planes.    ---   With the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index trading happily along at 17 times expected 1987 earnings, some money managers are uneasy.    &quot;This bull market has taken leave of fundamentals. It is beyond rational analysis,&quot; frets Henry Gailliott, senior vice president of Pittsburgh-based Federated Research, which runs $1.2 billion in stocks.    Mr. Gailliott compares the lofty price-earnings ratio to the frothy markets of 1961, 1968, and 1973-years that preceded nasty bear markets. He doubts corporate earnings can rise more than 15% to 20% this year, and considers a recession &quot;an even-money bet&quot; by year's end.    The Federated executive has held such doubts for more than a year -- a period when the Sandamp;P 500 climbed 25%. He says the market rise has only intensified his concerns about the severity of the next decline.    But other money managers find the market's buoyancy perfectly understandable. Susan Byrne, president of Westwood Management, believes corporate profits may well grow 20% a year for the next three years, and doesn't see any sign of a recession. She believes that's enough to support not only the current market, but a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 3000 or more within a few years.    Ms. Byrne notes that third-quarter profits grew 18% from 1985 levels. While fourth-quarter results were obscured by write-downs, she believes the third quarter is indicative of the earnings gains possible, particularly now that companies have lowered their break-even levels.    Such profit increases, she says, will fatten corporate book values, easing concerns about the comparatively high level of stock prices. (By one count, the market trades at 2.5 times book value, higher than the peaks of 2.3 in 1972 and 1968, and far more than the peak of 1.8 in 1961.)    She says the profit increases can occur even if the gross national product grows only 2%, because many industrial companies that were incurring losses have taken write-offs and stopped hemorrhaging. For example, she says, &quot;steel companies aren't losing a lot of money anymore.&quot;    Ms. Byrne says the Sandamp;P 500 companies' earnings, which last year were about the same as in 1979, are poised for a big move up. Companies such as International Paper, whose stock sold for 76 in 1976, only regained that level in the 1986 fourth quarter, she says. While the stock now has risen to 97 1/4, she adds, it didn't do anything for five years, and investors shouldn't say, &quot;Oh my gosh, these stocks have moved this quarter and I've missed them.&quot;    Although some analysts had thought Detroit would have difficulty selling more cars after the end of 1986, she noted that auto sales helped boost retail sales 4.1% for February. Among the 30 stocks in Westwood's $550 million portfolio are Ford, General Motors, Jaguar, Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber, and Echlin, a car parts maker. </TEXT></DOC>
