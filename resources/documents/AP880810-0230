Eight peoplewere reported injured.   The violence followed weeks of religious and social controversyover whether untouchables, traditionally considered the lowestclass among Hindus, should be allowed into the temple.   Federal Welfare Minister Rajendra Kumari Bajpai told ParliamentWednesday that the Rajasthan state government had been instructedto make sure all people, including untouchables, or Harijans, wereallowed into the shrine.   ``Our object was that the Harijans should enter the temple, andthat has happened,'' Mrs. Bajpai said.   The Press Trust of India news agency said residents attacked theuntouchables with stones at Nathdwara, in Rajasthan, about 330miles southwest of New Delhi. It did provide details of theviolence.   Last month, a group of untouchables tried to march to the18th-century temple to protest a Hindu priest's reported commentthat untouchables should not be allowed to enter the faith'sshrines.   Police arrested dozens of marchers at the time, apparently toprevent a clash between them and about 5,000 upper-caste Hindusguarding the temple.   The move, described as an attempt to keep untouchables out ofthe temple, drew sharp criticism.   The priest, Sankaracharya Niranjandev Tirth, was quoted byIndian newspapers as saying that untouchables have ``no religiousfitness to go to a temple.'' Tirth is regarded as a living saint bymany Hindus.   The untouchables had not been allowed in the shrine in pastyears.   The Harijans were traditionally looked down upon and their touchwas regarded as defiling. Such practices persist today in manyplaces, especially in rural areas, although discrimination againstuntouchables was outlawed in 1950 under India's constitution.   Hindus make up 80 percent of India's 800 million people. Theyare mainly divided into four major castes. Below the castes are theHarijans, a group without caste.   Harijan, which means ``Children of God'' in the Hindi language,was given to the community by the hero of India's independencemovement, Mohandas K. Gandhi.</TEXT></DOC>
