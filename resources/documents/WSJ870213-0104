Tokyo stocks closed mixed in extremely heavy volume.    In London, the Financial Times industrial share index declined 7.9 points, to 1501.0, and the 100-share index fell 17.2 points, to 1878.6.    Stocks opened higher but tumbled late in the morning. They narrowed their losses after prices rose on Wall Street.    Traders were divided about the reasons for the sharp morning drop. One cited lower financial-futures prices, which fell to the same level as underlying share prices and caused market makers to mark down stocks. But others blamed rumors of imminent government investigations into recently completed takeovers.    However, another trader said the rumors had little impact because they weren't new and &quot;there are so many stupid rumors all over the place.&quot; He said prices fell because a lack of buying interest gave the market makers a chance to mark down prices.    One other factor cited during trading was a fall in oil prices; Britain, a major producer of oil, closely watches changes in the price of crude.    Most sectors closed lower, with shares of oil companies and stores posting the biggest losses.    The Financial Times gold mines index fell 1.7 points, to 319.0.    In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average rose 60.93 points from Tuesday, to 19,874.89, and the stock exchange index gained 9.69 points, to 1743.44. But the number of declining shares narrowly outpaced gainers by 431 to 420.    Volume rose to 1.8 billion shares from 1.1 billion shares Tuesday.    The Tokyo exchange was closed Wednesday for a Japanese national holiday.    Traders said bullish buying of steel and securities issues accounted for yesterday's high volume and pushed up the Nikkei average despite scattered profit-taking. Shares of companies that make products related to the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome rose on news that the companies and Japanese government representatives will meet Friday and Saturday to discuss ways to fight the disease.    Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone shares were quoted at the equivalent of $12,108.50 at the close, up from $10,415.90 Tuesday, the first day shares in the utility changed hands.    The market was hardly affected by reports that a special meeting of the world's five largest industrialized democracies wouldn't be held over the weekend and that a cut in Japan's discount rate had been delayed.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                      % This                                 Feb 11    Feb 10      Year U.S. ........................... 260.3     258.2    + 14.2 Britain ........................ 567.3     561.1    + 14.0 Canada ......................... 384.2     381.6    + 15.3 Japan ......................... 1042.3    1042.3    + 10.3 France ......................... 422.9     423.9    +  3.6 Germany ........................ 218.2     218.5    - 16.0 Hong Kong ..................... 1932.1    1897.0    +  8.6 Switzerland .................... 189.5     189.6    -  5.6 Australia ...................... 283.2     281.5    +  7.3 World index .................... 400.4     400.3    + 12.2</TEXT></DOC>
