If present trends continue, said Dr. Antonia Novello, the diseasesoon will be the No. 5 killer of Americans from birth to their 24thbirthday.   In a report to Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen,Novello said present statistics, ``however tragic, sorelyunderestimate the true scope of pediatric AIDS.''   As of Dec. 12, 1,291 cases of AIDS had been reported amonginfants and children under age 13 and an additional 325 cases in the13-to-19-year group. Of those, 717 who were under 13 at the time oftheir diagnosis have already died, along with 174 who wereadolescents when diagnosed.   ``The official figures include only those children whosecondition was reported to the Centers for Disease Control,'' shesaid. ``Probably for every child who meets the CDC definition ofAIDS, another two to 10 are infected with HIV. It is estimated thatby 1991 there will be at least 10,000 to 20,000 HIV-infectedchildren in the United States.''   HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, and health officials aregrowing increasingly concerned that a large majority of thoseinfected eventually will develop AIDS and die.   Novello, deputy director of the National Institute of ChildHealth and Human Development, headed an HHS working group on AIDSamong children.   Her report to Bowen said the ``problem of HIV infection amongadolescents is enormously greater than the official count suggests.''   ``In view of the lengthy latency period between infection andsymptomatic disease, many of the more than 14,000 cases of AIDSreported in persons in their 20s must surely have been contractedwhen these people were teen-agers,'' she wrote. ``The repercussionsof HIV infection in adolescents are magnified by the potential ofthese sexually active young people to become parents themselves,transmitting the virus to yet another generation.''   Citing demographic data that the current U.S. population ofpeople between 11 and 24 years of age ``is unusually small to beginwith,'' she said, ``If AIDS were to make serious inroads in thisgroup, the long-term consequences could be disastrous for thenation's economy.''</TEXT></DOC>
