Determination of U contents usingthe radiometric field method leads to errors up to a factor of 200 relativeto the real U content (determined by {alpha}-spectrometry), which indicatessevere disequilibria in the /sup 238/U decay series. The disequilibriumstudies of the rock samples include bulk-rock analysis and leaching processesand are supported by investigations of water samples. The main result,that disequilibrium exists between /sup 234/U//sup 238/U and /sup 230/Th//sup238/U with excess of the daughter isotopes /sup 230/Th and /sup 234/Uand a singificant correlation between them is explained by daughter emplacement-displacementmechanisms due to nuclear recoil during weathering by percolating U-containingwater. It is shown that {gamma}-radiometric field methods in U prospectingcannot be used for the U-bearing weathered sandstones of the Lower FreshwaterMolasse. 36 refs.;8 figs.;6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
