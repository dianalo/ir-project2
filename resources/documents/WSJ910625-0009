Analysts said the company's projection fits a pattern ofdeclining expectations for oil companies with big West Coastrefining and market operations. Unocal stock was quotedyesterday at $23.25 a share, up 12.5 cents, in late New YorkStock Exchange trading.</LP><TEXT>   The Los Angeles-based company had net income of $165million, or 70 cents a share, on revenue of $2.72 billion inthe 1990 second quarter. The year-earlier results included a$132 million gain from the sale of properties in Norway,which Unocal said is excluded from its projection, indicatingthat the company expects net income to total less than $33million, or 14 cents a share.   A company spokesman declined to rule out the possibilitythat Unocal might report a loss for the current quarter or toquantify the expected decline from year-earlier results.   Despite the gloomy projection, Unocal declared itsquarterly common stock dividend of 17.5 cents a share,payable Aug. 9 to stock of record July 10. The company saidthe payout reflects a continued favorable long-term outlookand &quot;strong&quot; current cash flow.   Unocal said its profit is currently affected by trendscommon to others in the industry: lower refining andmarketing margins on the West Coast, depressed domesticnatural gas prices, and soft crude-oil markets in Californiaand Alaska. The company noted particularly its woes in theWest Coast gasoline market, where analysts say price warshave forced some marketers to operate at losses.   Analysts said they expect results at other oil companieswith big West Coast refining and marketing operations --notably Chevron Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co. -- to besharply affected by the squeeze on margins. Both companiesdeclined to comment.   The conditions outlined by Unocal &quot;are torturing them,&quot;said Marc D. Cohen, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.,adding that he expects Unocal to report net income betweenfive cents and 10 cents for the quarter. Mr. Cohen said thestock's stability in the face of yesterday's announcementreflects a longer-term hope that conditions in the usuallyprofitable Western gasoline market will improve.   &quot;You've got to be looking at 1992 and 1993 if you'rebuying the stock,&quot; said Frederick P. Leuffer Jr., an analystat C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. Mr. Leuffer said heexpects Unocal to report poor earnings for the year as awhole.   The pressure comes at an awkward time for Unocal, whichhas sought to sell or close underperforming operations.&quot;Unocal is in a period of transformation,&quot; said Richard J.Stegemeier, chairman, president, and chief executive officer,commenting on the earnings projection.   Mr. Stegemeier said several asset sales are proceeding onschedule and that the company is working to improve theefficiency of all its operations, including its West Coastrefining and marketing business. &quot;I'm confident that theseactions will improve earnings over the longer term,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
