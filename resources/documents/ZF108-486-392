(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Caroline HallidayandM;Buyers who want to add fonts to their LaserJet-compatible printers can beoverwhelmed by the choices.andP;  Options include font cartridges and many typesof soft fonts.andM;Font cartridges plug directly into a laser printer, are easy to use and donot slow the printing process, but they have limited sizes of fonts and areexpensive.andP;  Soft fonts, software stored on the PC, are flexible and lessexpensive, but are slower to print and can take large amounts of disk space.andM;Vendors of soft fonts and cartridges continue to debate the advantages ofeach form.andP;  According to cartridge vendors, the biggest advantages ofcartridges are ease of use and memory savings.andM;&quot;Cartridges are plugged in, take no printer memory, no PC hard-disk memory,no downloading time and are prepackaged to fit the needs of specificapplication programs,&quot; said Jane Eandi, a product manager at Hewlett-PackardCo. (HP) in Boise, Idaho.andM;&quot;With a cartridge you're limited to what you stick in the slot at the time,but the user requires no special knowledge, except for installing thedrivers, and many applications have drivers,&quot; said Leland Ancier, presidentof Atech Software, a soft-font vendor in Carlsbad, Calif.andM;Unlike font cartridges, soft fonts are volatile and must be downloaded eachtime the printer is turned off.andM;Also, where laser printers are shared, using soft fonts requires more carethan using a font cartridge.andP;  Each user may have to download the requiredfonts for every document and may be hampered by insufficient printer memory.andM;Kim Johnson, product manager at Pacific Data Products Inc., a cartridgevendor in San Diego, said, &quot;People are frustrated with soft fonts that aregone when they turn the printer off.andP;  Also, with multiple users you can'teasily tell if your fonts will fit in the printer's memory.andP;  Even once fontsare scaled and downloaded, you might ask, 'Are my fonts down there?' With afont cartridge, users know what fonts are in it.&quot;andM;The strongest point of soft fonts is flexibility, according to many vendors.andM;&quot;A cartridge comes with a certain number of typefaces at certain sizes.andP;  Withsoft fonts you can make more point sizes,&quot; said Steven Kreindler, productmanager at Bitstream Inc., a soft-font vendor in Cambridge, Mass.andP;  &quot;Softfonts have more flexibility in the number of available typefaces, and thenumber of devices supported.&quot;andM;&quot;The advantage of soft fonts over font cartridges is they are a better value,typically containing 50 or 60 different fonts,&quot; HP's Eandi said.andM;While most font cartridges do not support matching on-screen fonts, that maynot be a serious disadvantage, because not all soft-font applications supplyon-screen fonts for what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) viewing.andP;  Also,on-screen fonts, like soft fonts downloaded to the printer, occupy valuabledisk space.andM;Michael Vulis, president of MicroPress Inc. in Forest Hills, N.Y., suggestedthat users &quot;look at font cartridges if you use a limited set of fonts and arelooking for speed.andP;  Use soft fonts for point sizes of 40 points and up[because of memory considerations].&quot;andM;However, Robert Barritz, president of Isogon Corp., a font-compressor vendorin New York, cautioned: &quot;The quality of type offered by different vendors canvary radically.andP;  Buyers should look carefully before committing themselves toa vendor.&quot;andM;Three main types of soft fonts are available.andP;  The first is a collection offont files stored on the PC's hard disk, such as HP's families of bit-mappedfonts.andP;  A typical 10-point Times Roman font occupies 22K bytes; a 48-pointTimes Roman font takes 342K bytes.andP;  Several megabytes of disk space may berequired to store a typical selection of font files.andM;The second kind of soft font is a scalable font program, such as Bitstream'sFontware and HP's Type Director.andP;  In these programs, the user selects thetypeface, style and size, and the utility generates the font files.andP;  Oncecreated, font files are stored on the PC's hard disk.andM;To select these fonts in application programs that can make use of them,relevant font files must be downloaded to the printer before the page can beprinted.andP;  If the user changes fonts frequently or is on a network,downloading time adds up.andM;The third kind of soft font is also scalable, but is created &quot;on the fly.&quot;andO;This type, such as Swfte International Ltd.'s Glyphix Fonts and Atech'sPublisher's PowerPak, is closely linked to an application such asWordPerfect.andP;  Fonts are selected and changed in the application; when thedocument is printed, the font program takes control.andM;Required fonts are generated, downloaded, and then the document is printed.andO;Created font files are not stored permanently on the disk.andM;On-the-fly packages can generate fonts and print documents at least as fastas the other kinds of soft fonts, because they create only the charactersthat are actually used in a particular document.andM;The first two kinds of fonts do not know which characters will be needed sothey usually contain the whole character set.andM;For special effects such as shaded or outline fonts, a scalable font may bethe only alternative for buyers.andM;The trade-offs between font cartridges and soft fonts depend on the expertiseof the user, the variations in typefaces and font sizes required, and theprice.andP;  When using only a few fonts in specific sizes, cartridges are thebest, although an expensive ($99 to $1,000) choice.andP;  As the number of fontsincreases, soft fonts become a less expensive alternative.andP;  However, withlarge numbers of typefaces, even soft fonts can be a large investment.andM;----------Caroline Halliday is an electrical engineer at High Tech Aid, a BuffaloGrove, Ill., firm specializing in technical documentation and training forthe PC environment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
