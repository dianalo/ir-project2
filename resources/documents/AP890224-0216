REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Church bells rang out across thisisland nation Saturday as Filipinos celebrated the third anniversaryof the overthrow of President Ferdinand Marcos. But the lingeringdiscord here was plain to see.   About 3,000 Marcos supporters marched Saturday demanding theirousted leader's return from Hawaiian exile.   The military said a soldier and his wife were arrested in a vanpacked with explosives headed toward the site where PresidentCorazon Aquino was to speak later in the day.   The military also said an officer was placed under restrictionsin southeastern Luzon for purported links to renegade Lt. Col.Gregorio Honasan, leader of the August 1987 attempt to topple Mrs.Aquino.   Filipinos awaited the return of Mrs. Aquino from Japan, where sheattended the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, to take part infestivities marking the climax of the ``people power'' uprising thatpropelled her to office.   The main celebrations were planned on Epifanio delos SantosAvenue, where hundreds of thousands of people turned out three yearsago to protect military officers who mutinied against Marcos.   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre said about 2,000 troops wouldprovide security. Mrs. Aquino took office on Feb. 25, 1986 andMarcos fled to Hawaii.   Some prominent Filipinos who helped put her in power said theywere boycotting the ceremonies because the Aquino government lacksdirection.   Lt. Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy chief of the National CapitalRegion Defense Command, said the soldier and his wife were arrestedabout 9 p.m. Friday in Taytay, a few miles east of the celebrationvenue. He said the van was headed for Manila.   ``The implication is quite big,'' Oxales said. Asked if theexplosives were meant for a new coup attempt, he said: ``We'retrying to find out.''   Col. Marino Filart, Philippine Constabulary regional commanderfor southeastern Luzon, said a police captain was placed underrestrictions Friday in Albay province, 200 miles southeast ofManila, after admitting contacts with Honasan's group.   Filart said the captain, whose name was not released, saidHonasan's group asked him to join them but he refused. Filart saiddissidents had been trying to recruit followers in his area.   Honasan was prominent in the anti-Marcos uprising, but then led acoup attempt against Mrs. Aquino on Aug. 28, 1987. He escaped fromcustody in April.   On Friday, about 10,000 leftists took to the streets to expresstheir dissatisfaction with Mrs. Aquino, shouting anti-governmentslogans and burning a 10-foot papier mache effigy of the president.   Masked youths burned tires and exploded firecrackers and rocketsduring Friday's six-hour protest. The rally took place at theMendiola Bridge, about 300 yards from the presidential palace.   Many of the disparate groups that rallied around Mrs. Aquino,whose politics are centrist, have since fallen away.   They include left-leaning activists who dreamed of social andeconomic reform and military officers who believe their revoltagainst Marcos was taken over by old-style politicians inrevolutionary guise.   Mrs. Aquino's vision of the Philippines was the restoration ofdemocratic institutions: Congress, a liberal constitution and anindependent judiciary. Critics say that was not enough in a countryravaged by poverty, social injustice and corruption.   ``I will not join the celebrations because I think there is nocause for celebration,'' Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said. ``They reallywanted change for the country, but ... nothing is clear and ourfuture is still dim.''   As defense minister, Enrile led a mutiny against Marcos on Feb.22, 1986, that prompted civilians to fill the streets, protectingthe mutineers from soldiers loyal to Marcos.   Enrile later turned against Mrs. Aquino. She fired him as defenseminister Nov. 23, 1986, after a failed coup by his followers.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, another key figure in the 1986revolt, said Saturday the government had not had sufficient time toachieve all the revolution's goals.   ``We should not be discouraged,'' Ramos told reporters. ``Weshould not listen that our government is on the brink of collapseand that the Filipinos cannot do it.''   Left-leaning activists say Mrs. Aquino tolerates military abusesof civil rights in the 20-year-old war against communist guerrillasand has not pressed land reform and other social programs.   In a statement Thursday, the women's organization Gabrielaclaimed she had ``completely turned away from the people whoinstalled her in power.''   Arnel de Guzman, secretary-general of the Ecumenical Movement forJustice and Peace, said Mrs. Aquino had installed ``mere trappings''of democracy.</TEXT></DOC>
