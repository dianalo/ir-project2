Kelsey said the AIRS module that tracks air qualitydata went into operation in July 1987, along with the Geographic Common Codesmodule, a dictionary of numeric codes used in the system.andP;  Another module,the AIRS Facility Subsystem, which will track plant emissions and complianceschedules, will be installed in October.andM;The final module, the AIRS Area Source Subsystem for tracking emissions frommultiple small sources such as automobiles and fires, will be installed by1992.andP;  Development work on this subsystem has not yet begun.andM;AIRS will cost $6.5 million to develop, Kelsey said, not counting the AreaSource Subsystem.andP;  Computer Sciences Corp. developed the air qualitysubsystem.andP;  TRC Environmental Consultants Inc., Hartford, Conn., is designingthe Area Source Subsystem.andM;All development is in Adabas, EPA's standard database management system fornational large-system applications.andP;  Adabas is a product of Software AG ofNorth America Inc., Reston, Va.andM;Edward J. Hanley, EPA's director of information resources management, saidAIRS was designed in accordance with &quot;the special relationship we [at EPA]need to have with state governments.&quot;andP;  He said AIRS allows states to withholdaccess to data until they are ready to submit it to the federal database.andM;State officials &quot;are able to do a pre-edit on data they submit before theyexpose it to the national database, where EPA has access to it and cananalyze it,&quot; Slaymaker said.andM;STORET, a similar system, monitors water quality by making data reported bystates and other federal agencies available nationwide.andP;  STORET was developed25 years ago by the Public Health Service, then responsible for waterpollution.andP;  The system stores data on 11,000 types of water qualitymeasurements at 800,000 monitoring sites.andM;Geoffrey H. Grubbs, director of EPA's Assessment and Watershed ProtectionDivision, said STORET contains data on polluters and levels of waterpollution throughout the country.andP;  &quot;We are required by law [since 1987] topublish lists of waterways that are screwed up,&quot; repositories containandM;STORET's repositories contain chemical, biological and toxicity data,digitized maps and other files.andP;  Grubbs said STORET is used mostly by federaland state water analysts working on water pollution programs.andP;  But EPAofficials also use STORET data to defend their reports on polluters.andM;&quot;We get sued all the time,&quot; Grubbs said.andP;  &quot;We just got a call from acongressman's staff member who said a constituent is really upset he is onthe list.andP;  When you list names, you have got to be right.&quot;andM;Grubbs said he and Hanley recently agreed to fund a program that wouldredesign STORET software for the next century.andP;  The modernization will allowusers to run the large-system application on their PCs.andP;  EPA modernizedSTORET about five years ago, Grubbs said.andP;  It is written in an in-houselanguage based on PL/1.andM;The redesign also will allow new features if Congress changes the agency'smission.andP;  &quot;Congress monkeys with our legislation a lot,&quot; Grubbs said.andP;  &quot;Aboutevery three or four years, our laws change.&quot;andM;Grubbs said he also wants to make the system more accessible to the publicand allow citizens to contribute data.andP;  &quot;The major source of informationthat's missing, what EPA is really interested in getting, is informationgathered by citizen groups,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;EPA wants to modify STORET to keepsome of this less rigorous data.&quot;andM;Grubbs and Hanley recently began planning the redesign, which will begin nextyear and take three or four years to complete, Grubbs said.andP;  He would notcomment on the cost of the project.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
