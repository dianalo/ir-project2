In a series of five votes, the Senate killed, piece by piece,the amendment proposed by Steve Symms, R-Idaho.   Symms' amendment noted that Reagan has told Congress the Sovietsare violating the SALT I and SALT II arms-limitation treaties, a1963 pact banning open-air atomic tests, a 1925 Geneva protocolbanning chemical weapons and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   His proposal would have required that the administration certifythe Soviets are in compliance with all these pacts before theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty could have takeneffect.   Conservatives, using Senate rules, insisted on five separatevotes rather than a single roll call. In the tallies, the votes tokill Symms' proposal were 85-11, 87-10, 86-11, 82-15 and 89-8.   The decision came after Senate Republican leader Bob Dole ofKansas called on his fellow Republicans to speed up the action.   ``We need to start making real progress on the treaty itself,''Dole said. ``Time is of the essence; the president leaves nextWednesday'' for his Moscow summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev.   Dole said Republican senators have ``a special burden'' toassure that Reagan does not go to Moscow without ratification ofthe INF treaty.   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, a member of the Senate observer termwhich monitored the INF talks, told the Senate, ``As one of them, Ican stand before the Senate and say I have confidence in thistreaty, it need not be changed at all.''   Symms said his amendments ``simply mean that the treaty does notgo into effect until the president can report the Soviets are incompliance with existing arms treaties.''   Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., opposed the Symms proposalbecause he said ``it is designed to kill the INF treaty, not toproduce Soviet compliance.   Sen. James J. Exon, D-Neb., complaining of Republican stalling,referred to Symms' proposal as ``nonsense and extraneous.''   ``I think this is a terrible situation,'' Exon said. ``It wouldcripple the president as he represents the United States and thefree world.'' ''   Exon said Reagan will be partly to blame if the treaty isn'tapproved before the summit. ``The president could put his footdown. He is the president. He is the leader of the Republican Partywithout question. I think he is contributing to his own problems.''   As debate on the amendments opened Thursday, Symms told theSenate: ``The Soviets cheated in the past and I think we can expectthey're going to cheat in the future.''   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the ForeignRelations Committee, noted that the Reagan administration says thistreaty should be considered on its own merits.   ``To my mind, the important thing is what does this treaty do;does it help our security or harm it?'' Pell asked. ``I don't thinkwe ought to be in the position of cutting off our nose to spite ourface.''   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said the Intermediate-range NuclearForces treaty ``stands on its own merits. ... It's nonsensical totie this to other treaties.''   The INF treaty, signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Gorbachev, calls forthe elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of300 to 3,400 miles.   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said Reagan ``deserves anopportunity for this body _ before he goes to Moscow _ to say yesor no'' to the pact. ``The American people want this treatyratified and they want this president to have the opportunity tomaximize what may flow from it.''   Domenici said he would be surprised if more than 10 of the 100senators vote against the pact. Ratification requires 67 votes andDomenici's estimate is similar to forecasts by Senate leaders ofboth parties.   But the opponents could delay the final vote with parliamentarymaneuvers and by introducing numerous amendments.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., leader of the opponents, objectedThursday when Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., sought approvalto move from consideration of the treaty itself to the separateresolution of ratification.   Under Senate rules, designed to protect the rights of theminority, Helms' objection meant that the chamber couldn't move tothe resolution. Both the treaty and the resolution will beconsidered in separate votes.   Helms said he objected because three other senators, whom he didnot name, planned to offer amendments to the text of the treaty.   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., another critic of the pact,responded to Dole's plea by saying, ``For us to be hurried to suitthe climate of a summit is just a wrong urging at this moment.''</TEXT></DOC>
