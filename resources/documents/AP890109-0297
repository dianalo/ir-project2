Forget it.   Look at the 1988 tax rate schedules in your package of tax formsand you'll see there actually are four marginal rates: 15 percent,28 percent, 33 percent and 28 percent again.   Where simplicity is concerned, as long as there is more than onerate, it makes little difference whether there are two or 20.   That is because the great majority of taxpayers have no contactwith tax rates when they fill out their returns. Unless you havetaxable income _ which is what is left after subtracting personalexemptions and deductions from your income _ of $50,000 or more, yousimply look at the tax tables, find your income, read across thepage to your filing status and see what you owe.   About four of every five taxpayers will pay only the lowest rate,15 percent, on money earned last year. These people have taxableincomes of up to $17,850 if single and up to $29,750 if married andfiling joint returns.   When President Reagan proposed across-the-board tax cuts in 1981,his goal was to give people incentive to work more and save more inways that would improve the economy. He proposed to do this bycutting ``marginal tax rates'' as low as possible. Congress and thepresident had the same thought in mind when they approved the 1986overhaul.   A marginal rate is what you would pay on any additional dollarsyou earned. For example, if you are married and have taxable incomeof $27,000, your top marginal rate is 15 percent; you are said to bein the 15 percent bracket. Earn another $1 or $1,000 and it still is15 percent.   But earn $3,000 more and your top rate jumps to 28 percent. Youwould pay 15 percent on the first $29,750 and 28 percent on theexcess _ that is, on $250. You have jumped into the 28 percentbracket.   When Reagan took office, the top marginal rate was 70 percent.Now, it is 33 percent, although backers of the overhaul like toclaim it is 28 percent.   Here's how that works:   Remember that for a single person, for example, the first $17,850of income subject to taxation is taxed at 15 percent. Any additionalincome between $17,850 and $43,150 is taxed at 28 percent. Anythingbetween $43,150 and $89,560 is taxed at 33 percent _ and then comesthe complication: The $89,560 upper limit is increased by $10,920for each personal exemption claimed. Thus, a single person with adependent child pays 33 percent on taxable income between $43,150and $111,400.   And finally, any additional dollars above the top limit are taxedat 28 percent.   Why jump from a 28 percent rate to 33 percent and back to 28percent again? The answer is that congressional tax writers wantedto have what appeared to be a top rate of 28 percent but did notlike the idea of having a person with $20,000 of taxable income paythe same top rate as one with $2 million.   The solution was to deny wealthier Americans any benefit of thebottom rate of 15 percent and any benefit from the personalexemption. The net result was to impose a flat tax rate of about 28percent _ it can be more, depending on the number of exemptions _ onevery taxable dollar earned by these people.   As a side-effect, the well-to-do taxpayers who fall into thiscategory are facing a 33 percent marginal tax rate on some of theextra dollars they earn above the 28 percent bracket. For a singleperson with no dependents, this surcharge applies on up to $57,330of income _ that is, on everything between $43,150 and $100,480; fora couple with two children, the higher rate applies to $121,030 _everything between $71,900 and $192,930.   The more children in the family, the more income that is taxed atthe 33 percent rate.</TEXT></DOC>
