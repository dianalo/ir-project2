A $121 million fiscal 1990 shortfall in federal funds,caused by a rising unemployment-compensation workload andGramm-Rudman budget cuts, is forcing Indiana to slash costs20%. Claims offices were trimmed to 26 from 43, with 100 of740 workers laid off. Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey andTexas also plan office closings, layoffs or reduced hours,mainly for temporary help used for peaks.</LP><TEXT>   In New Hampshire, where the workload has nearly tripledfrom last year, the staff is down 7%. Officials &quot;steal&quot;claims workers from other jobs, such as tax collecting; butwaits in claims lines, usually a half hour, still climb tothree to five hours. California shelves control efforts thattry to avoid wrong payments or nonpayments.   A House bill would add funding, but the Bushadministration opposes release of more of theemployer-financed funds, short of &quot;a dire emergency.&quot;                                                                                                          THE WHITE HOUSE favors naming a rail-labor emergencyboard.   Officials say the president would form the panel to averta nationwide railroad strike. Railroads and 12 negotiatingunions both want the board, and the National Mediation Boardprobably will declare a bargaining impasse soon. The nextstep is the emergency panel. Health costs, soaring over 15% ayear, are the biggest issue; the railroads want worker $100deductibles and $2,000 out-of-pocket medical-bill limitsraised.   The roads seek work-crew cuts, freedom to assign work asthey wish and the right to contract out more, amongwork-rules changes; they also want to trim wages, unions say.The unions want 5% pay boosts every six months, jobprotection in short-line sales and an end to somesubcontracting.                                                                                                          CHILD-LABOR POLICE will step up enforcement still more.   New sweeps of employers are planned -- one before schoolis out and another in the fall. A recent three-day blitzfound 9,300 violations including kids working late or longhours, instead of the 7,000 estimated at the time, officialssay. Fines will reach $2.5 million, rather than $1.8 million.Violations will be announced in bunches, starting today.   The Labor Department's Employment Standards andOccupational Safety and Health agencies will sign anagreement this week for investigators at both agencies toswap data on child-labor and safety violations. &quot;Sweat-shop&quot;investigators often find chained rear doors, for instance, adanger in a fire. Similar plans are afoot with stateworker-safety agencies.   In a labor pinch, &quot;some employers cut legal corners&quot; byfilling low-level jobs with children, says William Brooks,the Employment Standards chief.                                                                                                          NO FOLLOW-THROUGH? Though 73% of 491 employers polled byplacement consultant Right Associates expect a skilled-laborshortage, three-fourths don't have a plan to keep most-neededworkers. Of those who foresee problems, 44% predict highertraining costs and 43% expect increased pay and benefits torecruit new workers.                                                                                                          THE MINIMUM WAGE rose to $3.80 an hour Sunday, but theLabor Department estimates that employers can pay the newshort-term $3.35 training wage for as many as 3.7 millionteen-agers. But finding youths at the minimum already istough. &quot;You're not going to find people . . . to work for asub-minimum,&quot; says Arby's.                                                                                                          THE SILVER LINING? The business of finding jobs for firedexecutives will climb 15% to 17% this year, topping $400million, the Association of Outplacement Consulting Firmssays. Lenders, builders and developers, reeling from weakreal-estate markets, contribute to the placement surge.                                                                                                          AUTO WORKER RETIREES plump for automatic cost-of-livingadjustments to their pensions. They lobby for the UAW to makeretiree COLAs a priority bargaining item. Canadian autoworkers won the benefit from auto makers in 1987. But only 3%of all U.S. pensioners have such COLAs, the Pension RightsCenter says.                                                                                                          GETTING TOUGHER: Firms push harder to share health costswith workers.   Fully 45% of 1,943 employers surveyed by consultant FosterHiggins in 1989 required employee contributions to premiumsfor individual coverage, up from 39% in 1988, and 75%required contributions for dependents, compared with 69%.Employee shares had held steady since '86, declining slightlyin '87 and '88. Average worker contributions eased a bit in1989, to $23.03 for employee-only and $69.46 for dependentcoverage.   But more than a fourth of the companies plan to increasethe employee contribution this year. Individual deductiblesof more than $100 were required by 60% of employers andfamily deductibles of more than $300 by 49%, up from 51% and42%, respectively, in 1988.   About 72% of employers required workers to pay part ofhospital charges, compared with 66% in 1988.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: Nearly half of 3,500 workers surveyed byconsultant Wyatt Co. said their managers are too tolerant ofpoor employee performance -- not by the surveyed workers, ofcourse. . . . The Tribune Co., its New York Daily News lockedin a bitter labor-contract battle, cancels a congressionalreception in Washington after unions threaten to picket theparty. . . . Record revenue trimmed the Pension BenefitGuaranty Corp. 1989 deficit 30% to $1 billion; but the PBGCfaces possible loss of a Supreme Court case to LTV, which has$2 billion in underfunded plans.</TEXT></DOC>
