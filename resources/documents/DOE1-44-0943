In order to be able to dimension the support for such conditionsproperly a few rules have been worked out which can be used in strataand support planning. The planning process is illustrated by examples.For stonedrifts and gateroads the roadway deformations caused by strataconfiguration, rock pressure and workings can be calculated in advancetogether with the required outlay on supports. In doing so it is necessaryto take account of the face layout and effect of extraction throughoutthe life of the roadway. Success in supporting the face is primarilyachieved by support resistance, roofbarcoalface distance and the delayin support setting. Better strata control may be brought about if itproves possible to reduce the distance between roofbar tip and coalface.To do this the equipment for equipping a face has to be integrated froma strata control aspect at the planning stage. 4 refs., 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
