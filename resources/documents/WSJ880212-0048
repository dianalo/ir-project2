Both companies are New York-based apparel makers.    Manhattan Industries earlier this week rejected as inadequate the pending $95 million tender offer and retained Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to help develop alternatives.    In a letter to the board of Manhattan Industries, Salant said it remains ready &quot;to discuss a merger&quot; and is prepared &quot;to enter into negotiations with respect to any and all aspects&quot; of its bid.    Officials of Manhattan Industries couldn't be reached for comment on the Salant letter.    Manhattan Industries continued to trade above the offer price yesterday, indicating the market expects a higher bid. The shares closed at $18.25, up 25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape. Salant shares closed unchanged on the Big Board, at $9.75. </TEXT></DOC>
