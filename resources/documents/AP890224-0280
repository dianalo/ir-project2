Gold prices paused their recent advance. Republic National Bankof New York quoted a bid of $389 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m.EST, down from Thursday's late bid of $390.70.   In early U.S. trading, the dollar rose during a temporary flurryof dollar-buying after the Federal Reserve Board announced it wasraising its discount rate by a half-point to 7 percent.   The buying subsided after currency dealers decided the rate hikewould have little impact.   An increase in the key rate, which is the interest the Fedcharges on loans to private banking institutions, was widelyanticipated in light of the decision by the nation's private banksto raise their prime lending rates.   On Thursday and Friday, a series of major banks drove up therates used as benchmarks for variable loan interest charges to 11.5percent from 11 percent.   Also, the dollar was sold due to persistent worries that failureto solve the U.S. trade and budget deficit problems will causelasting economic damage.   Many dealers decided to buy West German marks on the grounds thatinterest rates in that country will probably rise soon becauseinflationary pressures have been building up due to robust economicactivity.   In New York, the dollar finished at 1.81875 marks, down from1.82175 Thursday.   ``We are expecting some interest rate increases in Germany as thegovernment acts to get control of inflation,'' said ZlatkoGlamuzina, chief currency dealer at Banco di Sicilia.   Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened against the British pound. Onepound was trading late in London's day at $1.7520, cheaper forbuyers than $1.7595 on Thursday.   Later, in New York, a pound cost $1.7530 compared to $1.7605Thursday.   The dollar was quoted in London at 126.53 Japanese yen, up from126.29 yen in Tokyo at Thursday's close. In New York, the dollarclosed at 126.125 yen, down from 126.175 Thursday. Tokyo foreignexchange markets were closed Friday for a national holiday, becauseof Emperor Hirohito's funeral.
