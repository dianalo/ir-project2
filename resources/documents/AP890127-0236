Some law enforcement agencies that opposed creation of a drugczar question whether Bennett will be able to do anything more thantry to reduce demand. And they say their drug-control efforts won'tchange just because Congress created a new job, formally calleddirector of National Drug Control Policy.   ``My sense is that Bill Bennett and his mission will be toconcentrate on ... reduction of demand,'' Attorney General DickThornburgh said recently. ``We in law enforcement have our job todo, no matter who's up top, and we're going to do it.''   A transition official, who spoke on condition that he not beidentified, said that Bennett would keep close tabs on lawenforcement efforts, including those by the FBI and the DrugEnforcement Agency. But he said he also expects Bennett to use thejob as a ``bully pulput'' to encourage people to stop using drugs _just as he did during his 3{ years as education secretary underRonald Reagan.   Bennett declined to discuss his plans for the job until hisconfirmation hearings, aide John Walters said.   An official involved in coordinating drug control efforts in thepast said Congress didn't give the drug czar much power. ``He getsto advise on a lot of things and recommend a lot of things, butthat's about it.''   That is disputed by Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who fought foreight years to create a Cabinet-rank drug czar. The legislationcreating the job was passed by Congress and signed into law byReagan late last year.   The legislation's fine print requires each agency to write down,in detail, why it doesn't want to go along with any plan orbudgetary decision of the drug czar, Biden said.   Faced with the possibility that the agencies could be singled outfor lack of cooperation, ``they'll sign on,'' Biden said.   ``I'm confident Bennett can be a strong director,'' Biden said,noting that during his tenure as Education secretary Bennett was``strong-willed and not afraid to butt heads with the bureaucracy.He's not a guy worried about being criticized. ... That's anecessary ingredient for this job.''   He added, however, that Bennett ``has no demonstrable experienceon either the law enforcement side of the drug problem nor to thebest of my knowledge, any detailed views on the education-preventionside. I think the key will be who he picks as his top aides.''   Bush raised the drug issue to the fore when, in his inauguraladress, he said, ``This scourge will stop.''   But he also said the ``overriding problem of the deficit'' wouldmake it difficult to increase spending on law-enforcement efforts,so the main thrust of the drug war would be education.   And he decided not to include Bennett in his Cabinet where,symbolically at least, he would have been on equal footing withheads of departments involved in the drug war efforts.   At his first presidential news conference, Bush defended hisdecision to exclude Bennett from the Cabinet.   ``The reason he isn't in the Cabinet is that I've tried to reducedown the numbers of full Cabinet members.'' Bush told reportersFriday. ``And I think that Bill Bennett's time is best spent notworrying about agricultural subsidies but concentrating on drugs.''   Bush said he would make clear to the Cabinet secretaries that hewas insisting on their cooperation with Bennett.   FBI Director William Sessions, when asked how Bennett and the FBIwould work together, did not even address the role Bennett wouldplay.   ``Our drug strategy has been defined since 1986,'' he told USAToday. ``It is to attack major drug traffickers and money-launderingorganizations dealing in heroin and cocaine with long-terminvestigations, using court-authorized electronic surveillance andother methods that will allow us to solve those particular crimesand present a case that will deal with a major organization.''   FBI spokesman Tom McPoyle said, ``We think it's premature at thispoint'' to discuss the FBI's relation to the drug czar or hispolicies. ``It's foolhardy to fashion some kind of response tosomething that doesn't exist yet.''   But the FBI isn't just involved in law enforcement. Sessions hassaid one agent in each field office has been assigned to handleefforts to reduce the demand for drugs, even though such programsalready are being conducted by other agencies.   To Biden, that's a perfect example of the kind of decisionsBennett will have to make.   ``Why do we have demand-reduction people in the FBI, and 4,000people in demand reduction at the Department of Education, anddemand reduction in Treasury?'' Biden asked. ``That's what he isthere to solve.''   Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson of the Coast Guard says that some of theturf battles among agencies already have been resolved, but that theagencies are waiting to see what Bennett will do.   ``What's going to happen under the drug czar? I don't thinkanybody knows that except Mr. Bennett,'' Simpson said.   Part of the unknown, he said, is ``exactly how much power thedrug czar is going to have. I think that'll be defined by the firstguy in the office.   ``I don't think anybody considers Mr. Bennett a shy individual,''Simpson said. ``But on the other hand, what direction is he going totake?''   Working on the assumption that Bennett won't throw out everythingthat's been done before, Simpson said. ``We're going ahead with thethings we were planning on doing all along ... until the new peoplecome in and indicate a change of directions.''   When he was Education Secretary, Bennett called for involvementof the military in the drug war, reportedly advising in one memo:``The military should do to the drug barons what our forces in thePersian Gulf did to Iran's navy.''   Maj. David Super, a Pentagon spokesman, said Defense Departmentofficials are holding to their determination not to ``step over theline to police functions. ... We want that responsibility to remainwith civilian authorities.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Jan. 30</NOTE></DOC>
