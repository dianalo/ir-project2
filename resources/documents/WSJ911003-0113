(FDC)</GV><RE>CALIFORNIA (CA)NORTH AMERICA (NME)PACIFIC RIM (PRM)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   As Congress moves closer to meaningful reform of the U.S.banking industry, it ought to be wary of 11th-hour ideas thatcould undo the whole process. One of them is the &quot;core&quot;banking proposal being promoted by Rep. Charles Schumer. (D.,N.Y.), and supported by this newspaper. &quot;Core&quot; banking, inthe opinion of many bankers, regulators and analysts, is nota good idea. It is also an old idea that has managed to findnew life under the guise of reform.   Congress has rarely dealt with an issue so fundamentallyimportant to the future of the U.S. economy as bank reform. Ispeak here with a participant's perspective. Electedofficials must resist the politics of expediency and passmeaningful reforms that will allow U.S. banks to function asa vital part of our financial infrastructure.</LP><TEXT>   Congress must also step up to the plate regarding reformof the deposit insurance system -- and that includes reducingfederal deposit insurance coverage. So far, Congress has beenunwilling to do this. Consider, for example, the pressurethat escalating FDIC premiums put on a bank'sexpense-to-revenue ratio. BankAmerica estimates that its FDICinsurance premiums for 1991 will reach $146 million, comparedwith $75 million for 1990. Keep in mind that every dollarpaid in preminums, roughly speaking, represents about $15that are no longer available for lending.   The &quot;core bank&quot; proposal attempts to deal -- indirectly --with the effects of an out-of-whack deposit insurance systemrather than attack the fundamental problems of the system. Itis critical to reform the system directly. These reforms willtake courage and clear thinking.   Rather than protecting taxpayers from a bailout of theBank Insurance Fund, as its proponents claim, core bankingwould tie banks' hands in a financial marketplace that isgrowing increasingly more competitive. It would, in fact,create a new industry of &quot;core&quot; banks and then prompt theirfailure by keeping them from competing openly with otherfinancial institutions. If this sounds like a repeat of the1970s and Regulation Q's cap on interest rates, don't besurprised. The &quot;core&quot; banking proposal would send theindustry reeling back to the days of toaster giveaways.   Core banking would force banks to split into two tiers: a&quot;core&quot; bank that could pay interest on insured deposits toonly 110% of the Treasury bill rate; and a &quot;wholesale&quot; bankthat would pay market rates on uninsured deposits and engagein larger-scale lending such as commercial real estate andhighly leveraged transactions.   At a time when financial markets are rapidly shifting,successful institutions are those able to respond to marketdemands freely and quickly. The &quot;core&quot; banking plan wouldimpose unnecessary constraints on banks that are anathema tovigorous and open competition. Its primary dangers are these:   -- Movement of funds. By capping interest rates -- evenwith a floating cap -- the proposal puts banks at acompetitive disadvantage. Depositors may get 110% of theprevailing T-bill rate, but interest paid on bank deposits isfully taxable, unlike T-bill investments, which are subjectonly to federal tax. In a recent editorial, The Wall StreetJournal noted that &quot;widows and orphans would stick to the`core.'&quot; But in today's economy, widows and orphans may flockto a substantially higher-paying investment if the riskappears minimal. There is a major risk that &quot;core&quot; bankswould be open to a huge outflow of deposits, the same waybanks were when non-bank competitors offered money-marketinvestments in the late 1970s.   This outflow of funds would also endanger therecapitalization and ongoing funding of the Bank InsuranceFund. There would be far fewer deposits to assess. It seemslikely that the assessment rate -- which has nearly tripledin the past two years alone -- would have to be increased yetagain, reducing the rate banks could prudently pay ondeposits.   -- Tight credit. Given the sizable potential for movementof funds, the &quot;core&quot; banks would have less money availablefor lending in their local communities in the form ofpersonal loans and mortgage financing. Restructured banks'increased overhead costs, (required to maintain two bankingentities instead of one), would rob the economy of dollarsthat could instead be available for lending.   -- No decrease in risk. Addressing itself to loan size,the plan's tighter loan limits would not necessarily reducethe riskiness of insured banks. Small loans are notinherently less risky than large ones. And those loansconsidered risky -- loans for highly leveraged transactions,construction and commercial real estate -- are notnecessarily large. The average loan in Bank of America's&quot;highly leveraged transactions&quot; class, for example, is $16.5million. Strong credit control and loan discipline are thebest tools for reducing a bank's credit risk.   -- Too-big-to-fail pressures. The core bank proposal wouldincrease the pressure for maintaining a too-big-to-failpolicy. Uninsured wholesale banks would have access to thecountry's payments system but would not be covered by, orassessed for, deposit insurance. Many of these large banksultimately would be considered too big to fail, and thegovernment could be forced to stand behind large amounts ofuninsured deposits without the benefit of premium income.   -- The danger of experimenting. The &quot;core&quot; bankingproposal is a theory developed by McKinsey consultant LowellBryan and scrutinized by few others. The U.S. economy is incritical need of real banks and real capital, not untestedtheories. This proposal could create a &quot;core&quot; bank industrythat simply would not be competitive in the marketplace andcould self-destruct -- at great expense to the Bank InsuranceFund and the U.S. economy.   The Wall Street Journal recently gave a tacit endorsementto the plan in an editorial about bank reform that citedBankAmerica's merger with Security Pacific as &quot;the bankingindustry's latest attempt at self-help revival.&quot; TheJournal's preference is for deposit insurance reform and asystem of risk-based premiums for the Bank Insurance Fund.BankAmerica agrees.   But we don't share all the paper's views. The Journalcalled the Schumer plan &quot;not the perfect solution&quot; but &quot;theonly proposal on the table that would do anything aboutdeposit insurance.&quot; Not so. Having been defeated by the Housebanking Committee, this proposal is no more &quot;on the table&quot;than the far better proposal to limit FDIC coverage to$100,000 per depositor, also narrowly defeated.   The banking industry has more than adequate capital andreserves to keep the fund solvent. With stronger powers, andearlier intervention at failing institutions, the regulatorysystem can work without having to sacrifice the bankingindustry's flexibility, competitiveness and security.   Congress can do better than the Schumer plan, and it must-- for the sake of the U.S. economy and its constituents. Wemust proceed with a clear focus on free markets and opencompetition -- responsibly regulated -- that will allow U.S.banks to fuel a long-awaited recovery.   ---   Mr. Coleman is vice chairman of BankAmerica Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
