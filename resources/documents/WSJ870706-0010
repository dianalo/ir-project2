The price wasn't disclosed.    Thomson said it will market the software through a new unit, MUST Software International, based in Wilton. MUST said that Nomad software currently is installed in about 500 sites in North America and Europe.    Like its competitors -- RAMIS, sold by On-Line Software International Inc., and FOCUS, sold by Information Builders Inc. -- Nomad is a &quot;fourth-generation language&quot; product designed in part to make it relatively easy for an unsophisticated computer user to extract information from a large, complex data base.
