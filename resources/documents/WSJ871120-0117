RicksStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission embraced a definition of insider trading that includes the &quot;misappropriation&quot; theory, but only three of the agency's five commissioners fully endorsed the move.    In a letter to the Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on securities, the commission proposed legislation that specifically includes the misappropriation of information -- that is, a person's theft of inside information for his own benefit.    Inclusion of the term &quot;misappropriation,&quot; which didn't appear in the SEC's previous proposal, submitted to the Senate in August, represents a compromise between the SEC's definition and that drafted by several prominent Washington securities lawyers for the Senate panel.    But the SEC's letter said that one of its commissioners, Edward Fleischman, didn't endorse the proposed definition. Another commissioner, Joseph Grundfest, made his support for the definition contingent on the contents of an as-yet unwritten legislative history to accompany the bill. A legislative history is a record of congressional deliberations and lawmakers' comments to provide guidance for future legal interpretations.    Mr. Fleischman is traveling in Europe and couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Grundfest said, &quot;I don't buy a pig in a poke. A lot depends on the legislative history. I could go either way.&quot;    The SEC's split vote on the misappropriation theory follows by only three days the Supreme Court's release of its tie vote on the theory, which has been the legal backbone of insider-trading prosecution. But the theory was established by judges, and never legislated by Congress. That 4-4 vote by the high court had the effect of upholding the securities-fraud convictions of former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans and two co-conspirators. The court also voted 8-0 to uphold the mail-fraud and wire-fraud convictions of the three men.    The SEC's lack of unanimity on misappropriation could provide ammunition for opponents of the pending Senate bill. But that isn't considered a major problem by supporters of a statutory definition of insider trading. Theodore Levine, one of the attorneys who helped draft the Senate's insider-trading bill, said the SEC's &quot;staff supported it, and a majority of the commissioners supported it, and that's what's important.&quot;    Indeed, the Supreme Court's tie vote earlier this week, along with a speech last week by SEC Chairman David Ruder endorsing the misappropriation theory, were widely seen as boosting the pressure on Congress to formally define insider trading. Proponents of such a law have said that a statutory definition would clarify the theory and strengthen the SEC's enforcement program.    The two co-sponsors of the Senate bill, Sens. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.), said yesterday that the SEC's endorsement of a compromise position should speed the passage of the law. Sen. Riegle, chairman of the securities subcommittee, said in a statement that the SEC letter &quot;gives me confidence that we will enact legislation during this Congress.&quot;    Yet even if passed by the Senate, the insider-trading bill would still face a big hurdle in the form of Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the powerful chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Rep. Dingell repeatedly has expressed reservations about fixing a specific definition of insider trading, fearing it would simply give savvy lawyers loopholes to exploit.    In the wake of the Supreme Court's Winans decision earlier this week, Rep. Dingell said he planned to examine the decision &quot;to see whether any tightening of the law may be desirable to prevent future violators from escaping through judicial loopholes.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
