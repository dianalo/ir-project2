The D-C Flowsystem is a highly parallel multi-processor database machine for supportingvery large database applications. The main features of this system are:1) the use of a parallel query processing strategy which combines severalexisting query processing techniques such as the decomposition of queriesinto parallel processible tasks (horizontal concurrency), the data-flowand pipelined processing of large data files (vertical concurrency),and the sharing of temporary results among concurrent queries (reducingthe amount of redundant I/O and query processing), 2) the use of a verticaldata fragmentation strategy which increases the degree of concurrencyin I/O and data processing in addition to reducing the amount of datato be transferred among processing nodes, 3) the use of special functionprocessors which are implementable as VLSI chips, for efficient executionof primitive operations to support the processing techniques and datafragmentation strategy described above.</TEXT></DOC>
