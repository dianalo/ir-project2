Pelletreau Jr.,who once was held hostage by Palestinians, telephoned PLOheadquarters Thursday to make the first official contact of a newdialogue for Middle East peace.   Pelletreau, who escaped from his terrorist captors in 1970, helda brief conversation with a Palestine Liberation Organizationofficial at their Tunis headquarters, according to U.S. Embassyspokesman Adnan Siddiqi and the PLO.   Siddiqi did not identify the Palestinian or say what wasdiscussed. He said he did not know when to expect the firstface-to-face meeting of what Secretary of State George P. Shultzcalls a ``substantive dialogue.''   Palestinian sources speaking on condition of anonymity said thePLO delegation at the first meeting probably will be led byexecutive committee members Abdallah Hourani and Yasser Abd-Rabbou.State Department officials said the talks probably would beginFriday afternoon.   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat met East German leader Erich Honeckerand other officials in Berlin on Thursday, then headed to Romania.East Germany was one of the first countries to recognize anindependent Palestinian state. It was not known when Arafat intendedto return to Tunis.   On Wednesday night, Shultz announced that Arafat's recentstatements renouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel's right toexist opened the way for talks with U.S. officials. He designatedPelletreau as the U.S. government's ``only authorized channel ofcommunication.''   ``We hope that that dialogue may help bring about directnegotiations that will lead to peace,'' Shultz said. ``How thosenegotiations are structured, who is there to speak on behalf of thePalestinians is a subject that's a difficult one.''   The PLO, recognized by the United Nations and especially Arabstates as the sole legitimate representative of Palestinians, hasits political headquarters in Tunis, capital of the Arab nation ofTunisia.   Abu Yahia, PLO political director, confirmed by telephone thatthe conversation with Pelletreau ``really took place.'' But hedeclined to identify the official who spoke to the ambassador.   In Washington, an American official said Pelletreau called thedirector-general of the PLO political section to try to arrangetalks. It was not clear whether he was referring to Abu Yahia.   ``We're sure the PLO will try hard to have them take place assoon as possible,'' said the official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity. Another official said the first meeting certainly wouldcome within days.   Pelletreau, who has been ambassador to Tunisia since March 1987,is one of the most experienced and knowledgeable American diplomatson Arab affairs.   The 53-year-old native of Patchogue, N.Y., speaks Arabic andFrench and has served in Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, Lebanon,Jordan and Syria. He once was ambassador to Bahrain.   From 1985 until going to Tunis in 1987, Pelletreau was deputyassistant secretary of defense for Middle East and South Asianaffairs.   His first encounter with Palestinian terrorism came in September1970 when guerrillas of George Habash's extremist PLO factiondiverted three airliners to Amman, Jordan, and took the passengersand crews hostage.   Colleagues say Pelletreau enjoys describing how he outwittedcaptors who kidnapped him on the streets of Amman and took him withthe other hostages to a a downtown hotel news conference. Seeing hiscaptors were not attentive, Pelletreau edged in among thejournalists.   ``He was standing there as the press conference was going on andhe just walked away. He bears them no ill will. It was a greatadventure,'' a U.S. diplomat said on condition of anonymity.   ``Those were in the innocent days,'' he recalled. ``It's almosthard to remember the days when you just didn't kill diplomats.''</TEXT></DOC>
