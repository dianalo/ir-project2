The next, Jimmy Klein, his closefriend, injures his knee playing volleyball and probably will need six toeight months of rehabilitation.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AFTER THE SEASON, KEEFE HAS SOME DECISIONSTO MAKE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  College BasketballSee related story page 3D of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     These new road signs are catching his attention. Until recently, it wasassumed Keefe would join Stanford's volleyball team soon after basketballended and spend the summer preparing for his senior basketball season and theNBA riches that would follow.;    Shaken by Klein's injury, Keefe says onlythat he &quot;probably&quot; will join Stanford's volleyball team. His summer plans areuncertain, too, because he admits he's considering an early entry into the NBAdraft.;    &quot;It's a thought,&quot; said Keefe, who ducks no questions. &quot;But unless Ireceive (indication of the NBA's interest), it's not a question. I haven'theard from anyone.&quot;;    Waiting until season is over;  Some of those closestto Keefe -- his mother, his girlfriend -- say they have no idea what he'll do,other than set the decision aside until the season is over. The Cardinal hasthree games remaining and is trying to get into a postseason tournament.;   &quot;Adam has that ability to just put things away and lock the door and go on,&quot;said his mother, Suzanne Keefe. &quot;I truly don't think he knows what he'll do.&quot;;   Said Kristin Klein, Keefe's girlfriend: &quot;I don't think he has any idea,really.&quot;;    For now, he'll continue to do what he does best: plant both feeton the low block, catch the ball, spin, pump fake, drive to the basket andscore. As a post player, he's nonpareil in the Pacific 10 Conference.;    &quot;Noone else is as quick and as smart as he is,&quot; said Arizona's Sean Rooks, asummer league teammate who'll trade elbows with Keefe on Tuesday.;    Yet,Keefe is more than a 6-foot-9 post man. He has improved his passing, outsideshooting and defense, skills he'll need when he becomes an NBA power forward,whenever that is.;    &quot;Last year, you'd go to Adam and he'd score,&quot; StanfordCoach Mike Montgomery said. &quot;Now, he's moving in the direction of trying topass the ball, to go inside-outside.&quot;;    Keefe responds defensively;  Whenthe Cardinal lost Andrew Vlahov for the season last month because of a heelinjury, Keefe had to become a defensive stopper. He responded by holdingArizona State's Jamal Faulkner (three points), Oregon's Richard Lucas (14),Oregon State's Teo Alibegovic (11), Washington's Doug Meekins (nine) andSouthern Cal's Ronnie Coleman (15) under their averages.;    But Keefe said hemight have reached a point in Stanford's system where it's hard to improve thenumber that gets noticed -- his 21.2 points per game.;    &quot;I'm averagingexactly 12 shots a game,&quot; he said. &quot;It's difficult to go beyond that whenyou're averaging 12 shots a game. It was the same for Todd (Lichti, a Stanfordstar now playing for the Denver Nuggets). But Mike has been very successfulwith his strategy, so it doesn't change.&quot;;    Keefe's game relies on timingand endurance. He's resourceful with his limited jumping skills, thanks tovolleyball. There are quicker players but few who have the stamina to run afive-minute mile, as he has.;    Will seek several opinions;  But has heraised his game to an NBA level, where players soar above the clouds and runlike the wind? Keefe's mother said her son will seek several opinions beforemaking that decision.;    &quot;We've always thought Adam had a good head on hisshoulders. We've never said, 'Oh my god, what's he doing now?' &quot; she said. &quot;Hewon't go off on some mountain and make the decision by himself. But he has tolive with the consequences of his own actions, and he's been doing that forsome years.&quot;;    Montgomery, obviously, is hoping he'll be back.;    &quot;I thinkAdam would benefit in many, many ways by staying in school,&quot; he said. &quot;Themore it's talked about, the more it becomes an issue, a self-fulfillingprophecy. If someone came to Adam and said, 'We have $3 million for you; it'sa lock,' I suppose he'd have to take a look at that.&quot;;    It's often assumedthat a Stanford athlete will remain in school, because of academic ties. ButKeefe knows many baseball and tennis players who left school early to beginprofessional careers.;    &quot;I specifically remember an athletic banquet where(former Stanford athletic director) Andy Geiger thanked those athletes fortheir three years,&quot; Keefe said.;    It's a question he must answer before theNBA's May 12 deadline. Before that, there's another bothersome decision tomake.;    Keefe also must decide if he'll play volleyball. That had never beenup for debate before Jimmy Klein, also a starting strong safety on Stanford'sfootball team, recently tore an anterior cruciate ligament after spiking theball.;    Klein's injury was Keefe's worst fear, accentuated because Kleinalso is Keefe's fraternity brother, teammate and the brother of hisgirlfriend.;    &quot;That's a very scary thing for me,&quot; Keefe said, &quot;A scary,scary thought.&quot;;    Keefe loves volleyball so, he once considered it apossible career choice. Some say he could be the next great American player,following Karch Kiraly.;    Kristin Klein, a three-time All-America volleyballplayer, doesn't think Keefe will give up his second sport. If he does, it willbe grudgingly.;    &quot;Volleyball,&quot; Keefe said, &quot;brings me another month and ahalf of happiness.&quot;;    He made basketball a career choice last summer, whenhe finally convinced himself during the Goodwill Games trials that he couldplay at an NBA level. This season, he should have convinced any other skepticsthat he will play in that league some day.;    It's just a matter of when.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOHN AKERS, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910224  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,024  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 24, 199100055225,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
