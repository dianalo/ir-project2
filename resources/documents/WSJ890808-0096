And now he has -- but not the way he had planned.    After a remarkably successful career in publishing, the multi-millionaire head of Whittle Communications L.P. last spring launched Channel One, a plan to pipe teen-oriented, television news and commercials into the nation's classrooms. From a business standpoint, it seemed brilliant, cornering a captive audience of young, impressionable consumers and generating potential advertising revenue of $90 million a year. It was also typical Whittle: finding yet another way to expand the frontiers of American marketing.    But this time, Mr. Whittle, a former co-owner of Esquire magazine and a self-proclaimed &quot;revolutionary&quot; in the communications business, may have overreached. Already, state authorities in New York and California, among others, have vehemently barred Channel One from their schools, angered by the prospect of commercials in the classroom. In fact, much to Mr. Whittle's surprise, virtually the entire American educational establishment is up in arms over the plan.    &quot;He walked into an arena basically funded by tax dollars, where decisions are not based on business, they're based on politics and public policy,&quot; says Thomas Griscom, former communications director in the Reagan White House and now a professor of communications at the University of Tennessee. &quot;For the first time, he was suddenly on the national stage.&quot;    It is too soon, however, to count Channel One out. Mr. Whittle, for one, remains cheerfully optimistic, insisting that support is growing for the project. If Channel One ultimately does succeed, the 41-year-old publisher stands to become one of the most formidable figures in the media industry and in education. He will also be poised to launch his long-delayed political career. But if it fails, his privately held, Knoxville-based company will be out $165 million in start-up costs and will be &quot;digging out for 10 years,&quot; says Mr. Whittle. Win or lose, the experiment is likely to help define the blurred boundary between private enterprise and the public sector.    Mr. Whittle is foremost one of this era's best salesmen, as much a packager of advertising as a publisher. In the past two decades this only son of a small-town Tennessee doctor has built a publishing base and a life style that has earned him the sobriquet &quot;William Randolph Hearst Lite.&quot; Unlike the famed press baron, Mr. Whittle isn't a crusader. He remained aloof from such weighty issues of his era as the Vietnam War, which he says &quot;wasn't at the top of my agenda&quot; (he got a medical deferment). And although he says he has seriously considered running for governor of Tennessee in 1994, he insists that he isn't positive which party he belongs to.    But like Mr. Hearst, Mr. Whittle has built a fabled fortune, and trimmed it with lavish surroundings. His company is now worth about $400 million. Last October, when Time Inc. bought half of it for $185 million, he personally pocketed $40 million. A bachelor who has few close friends (&quot;very few people really know me,&quot; he says), he has poured much of the money into what friend and author Richard Stengel calls an &quot;obsession with beautiful places and things.&quot;    At last tally Mr. Whittle owned a neo-Edwardian co-op in New York's posh Dakota crammed with 19th century art and painstakingly renovated right down to the hand-tooled leather lining in his sock drawers (after 28 months of redoing the decor, he now plans to sell the place for a larger one); a restored farmhouse in Waitsfield, Vt., equipped with heated towels for guests; a beach house under renovation in tony East Hampton, N.Y.; and a 19th century-style, 70-acre country estate under construction in Tennessee. He is also building a $50 million faux-Ivy-League-campus-style corporate headquarters in a depressed section of Knoxville, an urban renewal project that has made him the toast of the Appalachian capital.    &quot;Chris is always calling me from some airport somewhere with his blueprints in hand -- he thinks about these things all the time,&quot; says his architect, Peter Marino. &quot;I just like to get things right,&quot; Mr. Whittle explains. He once tore down a newly built porch that he felt was 18 inches too narrow.    This attention to packaging, after all, is his strong suit. So it isn't surprising that Mr. Whittle has turned this skill to fashioning a political image as well. For starters, he has thrown himself into a crash course on modern-day issues, taking private tutorials on topics such as arms control and welfare at Harvard and Vanderbilt. He has been practicing his delivery with New York political consultant Roger Ailes, the man who coached Richard Nixon and George Bush. And, his lack of an announced party affiliation notwithstanding, he is forging some strong alliances with Tennessee's Republican establishment, such as former Gov. Lamar Alexander, who has consulted for Mr. Whittle, and former Sen. Howard Baker, whom Mr. Whittle hopes to hire to help with Channel One.    &quot;Some people are born with ink in their blood,&quot; says Mr. Whittle. &quot;I think I had politics in mine.&quot;    Logical, engaging and self-deprecating when required, Mr. Whittle has impressed scores of acquaintances as capable of selling anything, not least of all himself. But last spring, when he set out to pitch Channel One, Mr. Whittle encountered more than he bargained for.    His plan was to &quot;donate&quot; to high schools and middle schools the equipment needed to receive 10 minutes worth of Whittle-produced, daily current-events programming. In exchange, he would broadcast two minutes of commercials.    The backlash was instant.    &quot;Channel One is a dead duck,&quot; says Peggy Charren, founder of the advocacy group, Action for Children's Television, and a vocal critic of Mr. Whittle. &quot;If this was his first political test, he flunked.&quot;    The decision by New York and California to bar Channel One from their classrooms effectively lopped off 22% of the market, though California's decision may not be legally binding. (Mr. Whittle didn't help his case much by taking out a full-page newspaper ad lecturing the New York authorities about the merits of his project just before their decision was due.) An increasing number of other states have also denounced the venture.    Mr. Whittle needs to enroll 8,000 schools to make Channel One profitable. As of last week, only 14 had signed up. The publisher says, however, that only 155 school districts have been contacted so far and that, in addition to those schools that signed up, dozens more were positively inclined toward the project. Besides, the real marketing push won't start in earnest until the school year begins, he says.    But within the media industry, some people are already wondering how an operator as astute as Mr. Whittle could have stumbled so badly. Steven Florio, who knows Mr. Whittle and is president of the New Yorker magazine, no longer believes Channel One can succeed. &quot;I've been surprised so many mistakes have been made,&quot; he says. &quot;That's not a Whittle trait.&quot;    He says it may have been another Whittle trait -- pleasing the advertiser first -- that in this instance hurt him. Much of Whittle Communications' success has rested on form, not content, in particular its ability to design magazines and other publications perfectly suited to advertisers' needs. The company, originally called 13-30 Group for the age cohort it targeted, was founded by Mr. Whittle and Phillip Moffitt, friends and successive student body presidents during the late 1960s at the University of Tennessee. Their first publishing ventures were &quot;survival&quot; guides for freshmen, but they soon branched out to other service-oriented publications frequently underwritten by single advertisers. (In 1987, Mr. Whittle and Mr. Moffitt split up, the latter taking Esquire, which has subsequently been resold, and with Mr. Whittle taking the rest of the company, which he renamed after himself).    Mr. Whittle's claim to fame was his prescient hunch that mass-market media would be overtaken by more specialized and targeted competitors. He thus promoted such marketing concepts as &quot;niche&quot; advertising -- narrowly targeting specific groups of readers -- and &quot;exclusivity&quot; -- limiting the number of advertisers to avoid &quot;clutter.&quot; He has pitched product in everything from commercially underwritten books to billboard-sized posters plastered on laundromat walls.    The financial success of his little publications -- such as Southern Style Magazine, a beauty magazine underwritten by Procter andamp; Gamble Co. and distributed in Southern hair salons, and Special Reports, a set of monthly magazines given away free in doctors' offices -- rattled Madison Avenue. Many advertisers began to reconsider the premises on which mass market, general interest media buys are made.    Critics, though, have long raised questions about the editorial integrity of Mr. Whittle's advertiser-friendly, and often puffy, publications. &quot;Whittle,&quot; the New Republic asserted this year, &quot;hasn't just compromised the ideal relationship between advertising and journalism, he has inverted it.&quot;    Now, with Channel One, Mr. Whittle's tendency to let advertising drive everything else has &quot;backfired,&quot; says Mr. Florio. &quot;Instead of enlisting the support of the school boards and educational groups first,&quot; he says, &quot;they went to the advertisers first. Now, opposing it has become a 'noble cause' among educators.&quot;    Mr. Whittle admits that he underestimated how controversial Channel One would prove to be. &quot;I didn't see it coming. We could have been much more politically active than we were,&quot; he says. But in the same way that he seems not to see any tension between advertiser and editorial interests, he sounds genuinely baffled by the hullabaloo over ads in schools, asserting simply, &quot;If commercials were overall a negative force, we as a society would have dealt with them.&quot;    Mr. Whittle acknowledges that he ignored warnings. When friend and banker Richard Holbrooke, managing director of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., first heard Mr. Whittle describe plans for Channel One, he recalls saying, &quot;It's a great idea -- but have you read any George Orwell?&quot; He advised playing down the commercials, and playing up the educational benefits. Others warned Mr. Whittle to debut his project on a smaller scale. But says one associate, &quot;there's some cockiness there -- maybe even hubris.&quot;    Mr. Whittle maintains that Channel One will triumph yet. He cites public opinion polls and market tests done this spring that show a majority of students, teachers and parents support the trade-off of commercials for special programming and equipment. And he has sharpened his sales pitch, focusing on the need for current-events education in high schools: These days, he quips, many students think &quot;Chernobyl is Cher's full name.&quot;    He confidently predicts that, when Channel One officially airs March 5, 1990, 1,114 schools will have signed on, and 5,000 more will be committed. And he likes to point out that he has trumped naysayers before, such as when he helped turn Esquire around financially. &quot;Our critics have grossly underestimated us,&quot; he says. (At least two other groups -- Turner Broadcasting and public television -- clearly believe Mr. Whittle may be on to something. Both are exploring introducing programs for high schools, but with one politically astute difference. Having witnessed Mr. Whittle's troubles, they don't plan to carry commercials.)    A close associate suggests it may have been Mr. Whittle's political ambitions that impelled him to move ahead on Channel One so quickly -- a theory Mr. Whittle denies. If he is serious about running for governor in 1994, he clearly has his work cut out for him. One Republican, resentful of Mr. Whittle's waffling about party affiliation, asks, &quot;What does he expect, a draft from the entire state of Tennessee?&quot; Others wonder how a man with such a jet-set life style and flair for fashion would play in Davy Crockett's state. &quot;He'd have to get rid of the bow tie,&quot; suggests James Haslam II, a Knoxville Republican powerhouse.    The publisher, however, says he has no plans to change his style, and no interest in conforming to conventional wisdom. &quot;I don't think any rules in life are rigid,&quot; he says. That isn't to say that the pummeling he has taken hasn't left this political newcomer a little chastened. &quot;For much of my life, politics was an unchallenged assumption,&quot; he says. &quot;Let's just say, I'm challenging it now.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
