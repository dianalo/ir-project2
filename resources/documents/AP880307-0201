The same self-assured decisiveness made the warrior president ahero to his countrymen in the early 1970s, especially after the1973 Arab-Israeli war in which he could claim his bold moves led toan Egyptian victory over Israel in the Sinai Peninsula.   But in the years leading up to his assassination Oct. 6, 1981,as Sadat's temperament changed, many Egyptians turned against him,even though he remained widely admired abroad.   Those latter years are the ones being recalled now as members ofSadat's family return to a courtroom March 12 for a hearing todetermine whether the government can confiscate property it claimswas acquired through corruption.   Although the case against Sadat's brother Esmat and 10 membersof his immediate family is connected only remotely to Anwar, thelate president's detractors contend that Sadat's presidency is ontrial. They contend that Sadat's open-door economic policy led tothe kind of corrupt practices his brother was tried for andconvicted of.   ``Corruption increased in President Sadat's time,'' said KhaledMohieddin, head of the opposition National Unionist ProgressiveParty, an umbrella of Marxists and Nasserites. ``People justgrabbed money and ran away.''   Like Sadat, Mohieddin was a member of the Revolution CommandCouncil that ended the monarchy of King Farouk in 1952. The councilacted under Gamal Abdel Nasser, republican Egypt's first presidentand Sadat's predecessor.   During the Sadat presidency, Esmat Sadat allegedly amassed anillegal fortune despite later-disclosed efforts by the president tostop his brother's profiting on their relationship.   His activities were so blatant that on the first anniversary ofSadat's assassination by Moslem extremists, President Hosni Mubarakreportedly told him: ``Your stench has spread throughout thecountry. I'm not going to protect anyone.''   A little later, he was arrested and tried. Esmat Sadat, threesons and seven other family members were convicted on 24 counts ofinfluence peddling, black marketeering and bribery.   Their property was sequestered, and Esmat and three of his sonsserved nine months of a one-year prison term. The new court case isfor confiscation of their wealth, estimated at $8.2 million.   ``Esmat and his children were a dangerous burden on Anwar Sadatin his life and after his death,'' said Moussa Sabry, a Sadatconfidant who writes a regular column at the government newspaperAl-Akhbar.   ``When you see they traded, and stole, and have millions, ofcourse they used his name. ... People used to be intimidated intodoing what they wanted. ... Some people say he was not responsiblefor his brothers but of course it affects.''   Esmat's trial spotlighted ``infitah,'' the open-door economicpolicy that Sadat came up with in the mid-1970s. With itsloopholes, it created many Esmats, a class of the newly rich.Additionally, it created public frustration over the massive influxof flashy imports of luxury goods, from cars to designersunglasses, that were unaffordable for most Egyptians.   The policy served mainly private interests and foreign companiesin joint ventures. Many wealthy businessmen, feeling Egypt'spresent economic pinch, look back with regret at Sadat'sinitiatives.   ``Egypt was not being transformed from a planned to a marketeconomy but to a supermarket economy,'' wrote Mohammed Heikal, aclose adviser to Nasser and Sadat until they fell out over foreignpolicy.   ``The disrupting effect which this transformation had onEgyptian society can hardly be exaggerated,'' Heikal wrote in``Autumn of Fury,'' a bitter book about Sadat's assassination thatwas banned in Egypt for two years after its publication in 1983.   In the book's introduction, Heikal said he collected much of hisinformation from fellow prisoners after Sadat jailed him and 1,535others in a crackdown on domestic dissenters a month before hisdeath.   Some watched closely to see whether the decision permitting thesale of the book would start a downgrading of Sadat's memory. ButAnwar Sadat remains an honored figure in government eyes, becausethe bullets that killed him did little to change the governingsystem he had built.   His portrait remains posted on a major suburban road behind aguest house the government gave his family. His tomb in anothersuburb shares a place of honor with that of Egypt's unknownsoldier. The largest station of Cairo's new subway system, thefirst named, is ``Sadat Station.''   Nevertheless, much of the popular local support Sadat had won bymaking peace with Israel and his vow of ``no more war'' was erodedby the wave of arrests in September 1981. Moreover, he shut down ahalf-dozen Moslem and Coptic Christian publications, withdrew staterecognition of Coptic Pope Shenouda III and banished him to adesert monastery, thereby alienating Egypt's 6 million Copts.   A year after Sadat's death, Esmat's trial came as a welcomechange to many people in a country where authorities often turned ablind eye to dubious acts by the powerful. Eager crowds outside thecourthouse cheered ``long live justice'' on hearing days, and whenthe verdict and sentence were read, about 300 spectators in thecourtroom burst into applause.   Commenting on Sadat's legacy after seven years, Moussa Sabrysaid, ``The Egyptians, and not only the Egyptians but the Arabpeople, have started to realize that this man's view was ahead ofEgypt's thinking. He actually managed to create peace between Egyptand Israel, and to get back our land.''   In her recently published memoirs, Sadat's widow Jihan wistfullyconceded that Sadat's star has not shone as brightly with hiscompatriots as she feels it should have.   ``Someday, Egyptians will recognize what Anwar did for hiscountry and give him his rightful place in history,'' she wrote.``With patience, I wait.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs March 10</NOTE></DOC>
