Jeffery Middleton, 23, andPvt. Robert D. Talley, 18, are parked in their armoredvehicle in the Iraqi desert. They have four minutes to live.   At that moment, a ground commander radios to a helicopterabove the desert. &quot;Can you engage those two vehicles?&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Helicopter: &quot;Roger, I can shoot those easy.&quot;   Ground commander: &quot;Go ahead. Take them out.&quot;   The resulting explosion reduces the Bradley fightingvehicle to molten rubble three feet high, shoots flames 100feet into the sky -- and is still reverberating, because allof the soldiers involved were American. Cpl. Middleton andPvt. Talley were two of 35 American soldiers killed by&quot;friendly fire&quot; during the Iraq war, and the helicoptergunner and mission leader who pulled the trigger, Lt. Col.Ralph Hayles, was the only American disciplined in thedeaths.   Col. Hayles, a 20-year veteran who was the subject of afront-page article in this newspaper on Sept. 10, wasstripped of command and retired. The Army says that's notbecause of the deaths, but because an officer of his rankshould have been managing, not shooting.   Now videotapes from the internal recorders of theattacking helicopters -- from infrared night-vision cameras-- shed more light on the incident. They also show anotherside to the precise, high-tech battle characteristic of theIraq war -- a tale of flawed technology and human error.&quot;Things weren't as glorious as they led people to believe,&quot;says Cpl. Middleton's mother, Joyce. &quot;This high-tech systemoutdid itself,&quot; adds her husband, Bill. &quot;They sure can shootgood, but they can't see if it's a cow or a coyote.&quot;   The tapes show that Col. Hayles hesitated to fire -- hesays he feared the vehicles might be friendly -- but wasordered to shoot. But he says the tapes don't change anythingfor him. &quot;I never want to fly again. I killed two good men onmy last flight,&quot; says the 42-year-old officer, who had wonrave reviews from superiors for molding the First InfantryDivision's Apache helicopter battalion into one of the Army'smost highly disciplined units. Pentagon officials declinecomment on the tapes.   The alert came in at 12:15 a.m. on Feb. 17. Amid ablinding sandstorm, First Division's headquarters gets wordthat enemy armor might be threatening an American armoredcolumn. In fact, pilots on the mission say later that theydoubt there were any Iraqi vehicles to begin with; they saythe U.S. armored troops, confused in the sandstorm, simplymistook others in their own column for the enemy and calledin the air support. The armored commanders won't comment.   Three AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, wasp-like warmachines fit for science fiction, launch at 12:22 a.m. Thesix-foot-two Col. Hayles is in the lead. The recorders arestuffed inside the helicopters' eight-ton mass near thesilver-suited pilot and co-pilot. Mounted outside are 16Hellfire missiles, each capable of burning through any armor.The 30mm cannon can fire 600 rounds per minute.   The helicopters hover over a line of more than a dozenU.S. armored vehicles stretching east and west, facing north.The more distant vehicles appear as shimmering, ghostly whitesilhouettes on a black background.   12:55 a.m.: The synthesized, highpitched voice of theApaches' computers break in to warn: &quot;Radar searching.&quot; Itmeans nearby radar is scanning the helicopters. They could bemoments away from being blown from the sky. Apache pilots aretrained to consider retreating from such danger.   12:56 a.m.: Col. Hayles, code-named Gunfighter Six,reports that one of his helicopter crews has spotted twovehicles about a half-mile north of the Allied line. Despiteall of its high-tech gadgetry, the Apache can't distinguishbetween friendly and enemy forces. Col. David Weisman,code-named Iron Deuce Six, commander of the armored vehiclespositioned underneath the Apaches, gives the order fromheadquarters to &quot;take them out.&quot;   12:57 a.m.: Col. Weisman, urgency building in his voice:&quot;Let's go ahead and shoot those, get rid of those.&quot;   12:58 a.m.: Col. Hayles tries to fire a burst from his30mm cannons. &quot;The gun jammed. Son of a bitch.&quot;   Col. Weisman: &quot;Go ahead and take 'em out.&quot;   12:59 a.m.: &quot;Boy, I'm going to tell you, it's hard to pullthis trigger,&quot; Col. Hayles says.   Chief Warrant Officer Larry LeBlanc, Col. Hayles'sco-pilot, steadies the Apache and helps zero in on thetargets. &quot;There you go,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, do the mother-.&quot;   &quot;I'll be firing in about 10 seconds,&quot; says Col. Hayles.   Chief LeBlanc: &quot;Okay, do 'em.&quot;   But Col. Hayles hesitates for another half-minute.   Chief LeBlanc urges him on again. &quot;We're ready. Do 'em.&quot;   1 a.m.: Col. Hayles pulls a red trigger. The infraredscreen shows the Hellfire's six-second flight. It rises in a400-yard-high arc before diving through the top of a Bradleyfighting vehicle. The Apache viewer glows with the explosion.The vehicle now appears in pieces spread out over about 50yards.   Col. Hayles: &quot;Gunfighter Six. Completely destroyed thefirst target.&quot; Soldiers later reported the Bradley gushedmolten chunks of armor for hours. Cpl. Middleton and Pvt.Talley died; the three other crewmen escaped.   Chief LeBlanc: &quot;Let's go.&quot;   Col. Hayles: &quot;I'm going to shoot the second one. It'sfixing to go away.&quot;   Chief LeBlanc: &quot;Let's do 'em. This Bud's for you.&quot;   1:01 a.m.: A Hellfire strikes the second target, an M-113armored personnel carrier parked just a few yards from thedestroyed Bradley, with three crewmen. They escape withrelatively minor injuries. But another Apache crew warns thatenemy soldiers are fleeing the two burning vehicles.   Col. Hayles: &quot;Trust me when I say any personnel aroundthose targets are dead. Oh, we got two personnel walkingaway.&quot;   Col. Weisman, wondering if the Apaches can shoot thesurvivors, asks: &quot;Have you got guns?&quot; Col. Hayles reiteratesthat his 30mm cannon is jammed. But one of the other Apachesfires its cannons several times. The shots miss.   1:02 a.m.: Col. Weisman receives reports from his groundforces: &quot;Friendly vehicles may have been hit,&quot; he says.   Col. Hayles: &quot;Roger. I was afraid of that. I was reallyafraid.&quot;   Col. Weisman: &quot;Cease fire.&quot;   Col. Hayles: &quot;Cease fire. I hope it's not friendlyvehicles I blew up. Because they're all dead.&quot;   1:03 a.m.: The Apache crews hover, watching in horror asthe vehicles burn in the distance. Col. Hayles: &quot;They're justblowing up like mad out there.&quot; Ground officers radio formedics. &quot;We're moving Band-Aids in,&quot; says a ground officer.   1:04 a.m.: Col. Hayles: &quot;I bet I killed friendly people.&quot;   1:05 a.m.: Col. Hayles: &quot;Request to break station and gohome.&quot;   Col. James Mowery, answering from an armored vehicle tothe rear: &quot;Continue to work for Iron Deuce Six. Those thingsare going to happen.&quot;   1:06 a.m.: Col. Hayles to Capt. Daniel Garvey in one ofthe other Apaches: &quot;What do you think, Dan? Do you think Iscrewed up?&quot;   Capt. Garvey: &quot;No. I don't think you screwed up.&quot;   Col. Hayles: &quot;I just killed a bunch of people.&quot;   1:07 a.m.: The three Apaches fly along the U.S. armoredcolumn and Col. Hayles notes that the burning vehicles aresome distance from the rest -- giving the appearance theyaren't part of the friendly forces. &quot;There's the screen lineand there's the two vehicles way out in front.&quot;   1:07 a.m.: Chief LeBlanc: &quot;That's correct. That'saffirmative. Let's let them work through it. Seems like theydon't know what the {expletive} is going on. We'll sort itout later.&quot;   Col. Hayles: &quot;He said shoot 'em up. Well, there they are,and they're shot up.&quot; Moments later, he adds, &quot;I killed somepeople.&quot;   The General Accounting Office is investigating flaws inthe Apache's targeting devices. Meanwhile, the Army andMarines have begun tagging their vehicles with electronicbeacons to help ward off friendly fire in the future. &quot;Iwon't let this slide,&quot; says Cpl. Middleton's mother. &quot;I wantsomething done about it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
