The incineratorsthen available divided more or less into proven designs used in municipalrefuse incineration and so-called advanced systems: SGN's initial impressionwas that systems for municipal refuse incineration could be readily adaptedto handle combustible nuclear wastes. These systems mainly employed excess-airfixed-bed combustion, rotary furnaces or fluidized-bed combustion, sometimeswith partial or total pyrolysis. The &quot;advanced&quot; systems proposed by variousinventors were far more sophisticated but, due to a lack of industrialexperience, were often designed with inadequate regard to human safety.The result was a number of serious accidents, including some deaths.Nuclear-grade incineration was a rather esoteric subject at the time.Standard incinerators were not designed to handle radioactive wastes.They lacked essential safety features (e.g. leaktightness) and did notprovide for repair and maintenance after contamination nor for affordabledismantling at end of life. Off-gas cleaning had neither the efficiencynor safety required in the nuclear industry. Extensive automation ofcontrol and monitoring was not envisaged, because unnecessary in traditionalapplications.</TEXT></DOC>
