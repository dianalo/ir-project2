But I'm just not goingto get into it any further,'' said Benton H. Faulkner. ``It (ArcticCircle) just didn't fit our mainstream, marketing automotive oiland other automotive after-market products and services.''   Faulkner said Monday that Quaker is planning to keep theMinit-Lube chain, which was originally affiliated with ArcticCircle Inc. Most of the Minit-Lube centers are in the westernUnited States.   Gary Roberts, an Arctic Circle official at the company's SaltLake City headquarters, said Arctic Circle Restaurants are in Utah,California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, Montana andNebraska.   Quaker State purchased Arctic Circle and its 90-service-centerMinit-Lube chain in November 1985 from J.R. Edwards, son of ArcticCircle founder Don Carlos Edwards, and five other partners.   The number of Arctic Circle restaurants have remained at about100 since 1985, said Faulkner.   Minit-Lube outlets recently numbered 261, up from 98 at the endof 1985, he added.   Quaker State markets consumer automotive products and produceslubricants, fuels and automotive lighting equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
