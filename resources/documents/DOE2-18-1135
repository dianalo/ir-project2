The heating methodof this study is inductive heating of steel bars by creating a magneticfield induced by applying high frequency current to a coil. An advantageof the heating technique is that steel bars need not to be exposed. Theresults of the experiments of applying electrical inductive heating tothe reinforced concrete specimens show that cracks appear in the concretesurface, thereby enabling easy demolishment of the surface concrete.(orig./HP).</TEXT></DOC>
