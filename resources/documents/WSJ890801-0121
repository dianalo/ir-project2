A year ago, dissident shareholders won control of Cooper's board and promptly gave the heave-ho to Parker G. Montgomery. The chairman and chief executive officer's convoluted corporate strategy, they felt, was responsible for the stock's long decline.    Since the new team took power, the company's stock has tumbled 70%. The health-care products maker is now virtually a shell company. Its market capitalization has fallen from $650 million to less than $60 million. And there are allegations that the only people to have benefited from the ouster are the dissidents themselves.    Now, a different group of unhappy shareholders has emerged. The new group alleges that mismanagement of a company divestiture program and overly generous salary and bonus payments have nearly wiped out what little was left of Cooper's common shareholders' equity.    Adding a twist to the tale, two of the original dissident directors recently were squeezed off the board and may throw their substantial votes to the new dissidents.    The challengers have filed suit to block Cooper's annual shareholder meeting, which is scheduled to take place on Wednesday in New York. They allege that management's proxy fails to disclose the company's &quot;startling financial deterioration.&quot;    Cooper's current management says it is just playing out a bad hand it inherited from Mr. Montgomery, whose nonstop deal-making had Cooper making everything from dental floss to medical lasers. Management claims Mr. Montgomery committed &quot;numerous acts of corporate waste&quot; and mismanagement, and says the continuing free-fall in the price of Cooper stock can be attributed directly to an &quot;overburdened&quot; debt position that Mr. Montgomery left behind.    Mr. Montgomery denies such charges and suggests his successors have been the profligate ones. &quot;They may be the highest paid board of directors in the world,&quot; he says.    The new dissident group has nominated a slate that includes several people with links to Mr. Montgomery, and the proxy fight is being bankrolled by two former sister companies of Cooper that are headed by Mr. Montgomery. But Moses Marx, a New York broker and substantial Cooper shareholder who is backing the latest overthrow attempt, says the deposed executive &quot;will not and does not have any say whatsoever about what would happen if the committee takes over the company.&quot;    Mr. Montgomery says he isn't seeking to regain control. Some analysts say he is really angling for a better deal for holders of Cooper preferred shares, the principal assets of the two companies Mr. Montgomery heads. Current management hasn't registered the preferred or paid dividends on it.    Cooper's appeal is difficult to divine: in the latest six fiscal periods, it reported a total net loss of $245.4 million. Its operating assets have been sold off almost completely. Management intends to make as yet undetermined acquisitions using some $185 million in proceeds from asset sales.    The price of Cooper stock has fallen precipitously from a 1986 high of $28.50 to less than $3 a share. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the shares closed at $2.375, down 25 cents.    For most of the last year, Cooper has been in the hands of two sets of brothers: Bruce, Wayne and Howard Sturman, Mount Vernon, N.Y., real-estate developers, and Gary, Steven and Brad Singer, involved in construction in New York.    Together, the Sturmans and Singers, all of whom are less than 40 years old, own about 15% of Cooper's stock, and have controlled six of nine board seats.    Their original plan was to &quot;take immediate steps to sell extraneous assets and otherwise drastically reduce nonessential corporate overhead expenses.&quot; Over the last year, the new team has sold most of Cooper's remaining assets, including its diagnostic unit to Miles Inc. That sale has drawn the wrath of the dissidents, who claim management gave unduly generous inducements to bondholders to obtain their approval of the transaction.    The dissidents also question the company's new attention to bottom-line basics. The Sturmans and the Singers each named one family member to jointly serve as co-chairmen of the board at an annual salary of $300,000 apiece. The company's recently hired chief executive officer and president will be paid $500,000 this year, not counting his $200,000 relocation bonus and a guaranteed annual bonus of &quot;not less than $250,000.&quot; And, after having to disgorge more than $10 million in severance to Mr. Montgomery and two of his lieutenants, the new team arranged its own set of golden parachutes worth three years' pay.    In addition, the Sturmans and the Singers have reaped big profits from what Cooper calls its Divestiture Incentive Program, a controversial corporate kitty from which bonus payments are allocated to certain employees at various steps in the company's asset sell-off. Each of the Sturman brothers gets 12% of any payment. So does co-chairman Gary Singer, and director Steven Singer. Brad Singer, who doesn't work for the company full-time, doesn't get a cut, but the Singers' father, Martin -- who until recently was pulling down a $200,000 annual salary as a &quot;full-time senior consultant&quot; to the company -- gets 12%. Other employees get smaller pieces.    To date, the DIP has yielded a total of $2.4 million, but an additional $4 million is expected for a recently completed sale and a planned minor divestiture. If those figures hold, the 12% participants will each have garnered a total of $768,000 from bonuses.    Gary Singer defends the rewards as commensurate with the long hours the families have put in to expedite the unit sales.    But family ties seem to be wearing thin. Howard and Wayne Sturman, as well as another director, won't be standing for re-election because they refused to sign a &quot;loyalty oath&quot; that requires directors to vote their personal shareholdings for management nominees. Bruce Sturman signed the oath. Yesterday, Cooper said it &quot;terminated for cause&quot; the employment of Howard Sturman as co-chairman, and Wayne Sturman as &quot;senior consultant.&quot; (None of the Sturmans could be reached for comment.)    And there are others whose allegiances are shifting. The company's principal spokesman, who in the current fiscal year pocketed $160,000 in bonuses, recently resigned, declaring: &quot;I cannot in good conscience support present management's position.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
