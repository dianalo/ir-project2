When the trivalent Y ions are substituted for thetetravalent Zr ions, O{sup 2-} vacancies are also introduced for chargecompensation. However, the distribution of the O{sup 2-} vacancies inthe structure is not known. In this EXAFS study, systematics of disorderand vacancy distribution on the oxygen sublattice are monitored fromboth the Zr and Y sites as Y, and hence O{sup 2-} vacancy content, isvaried. It is observed that oxygen vacancies occur adjacent to both Yand Zr ions but preferentially in proximity to Zr. 18 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
