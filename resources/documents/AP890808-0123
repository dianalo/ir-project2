(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the quiet Pleasure Lake community, wherehouses and mobile homes cluster around a fish pond crowded withcypress, some neighbors had a feeling something was wrong at thesecondhand Jackson trailer.   The 13-year-old girl who lived there with her mother, stepfatherand four brothers could sometimes be heard crying, ``Stop it,'' oneneighbor said. She was seldom allowed out, said another, except toborrow food and cigarettes.   Then, last month, ``the little girl walked across the street andtold my adopted granddaughter that she had to talk to someone,''said neighbor Roy Pitts. ``I could tell she had been crying.''   After she told her story, child welfare authorities came to pickup the girl and a few hours later investigators arrested herstepfather and four brothers on 46 counts, including childmolestation.   ``We don't work a case every day where the victim's own siblingsare involved,'' Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent Paul Musicktold The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``This is the first time Ican remember when we've arrested every male in the family'' onmolestation charges.   Arrested were Harold Jackson, 39, the girl's stepfather, and herfour brothers _ Jerry Medlin, 21; Wesley Medlin, 19; Edward Medlin,17; and a 16-year-old whose name was withheld.   When Pitts talked to the girl last month, ``she said her olderbrother had kept her in bed all day and that he had laid out ofwork because she would be home alone,'' he recalled.   Neighbors said she did not have a key to the trailer, andsometimes had to sit outside for hours until her parents came homefrom work. Pitts said he saw her when her brothers made her ``bumcigarettes for them.''   ``They stayed shut up in the house,'' said 74-year-old HazelTucker, who lives next door along the dusty dirt road around thelake. ``She'd run out and one of her brothers would ... take her inthe house and slam the door.''   Carol Tucker, Mrs. Tucker's daughter-in-law, told TheJournal-Constitution she sometimes heard cries of ``Stop it'' fromthe Jackson trailer, but thought they were just typical familysquabbles.   ``She'd come out of the door and say, `Leave me alone,''' sherecalled. ``When I heard about the arrests it upset me real bad.''   The Tuckers, Pitts and other neighbors were interviewed a fewhours before a Superior Court judge issued a gag order barringattorneys, law-enforcement personnel and potential witnesses fromdiscussing the case.   Judge John D. Crosby approved the motion Friday at the requestof Assistant District Attorney Diane Perry, who said the gag orderwas needed to protect the alleged victim and to ensure a fair trialfor the defendants.   The girl's mother, Beth Jackson, told the judge that newsreports were causing her great emotional distress and problems atwork. Mrs. Jackson has told authorities she was unaware of anysexual assaults on her daughter.   Jackson and the three oldest brothers attended the hearing. Theyare being held in the Irwin County Jail, and the juvenile is beingheld in the Youth Detention Center in Eastman.   Officials said the charges against the stepfather and the fourbrothers are based on alleged assaults dating back to January 1988.Pitts said the girl told him ``it had been happening since she was8 years old.''   He said he believed the girl sought help out of fears she mightbe pregnant: ``She told my granddaughter, `I might be pregnant, andI'm scared.'''   She is in foster care pending the outcome of the case.   People who report suspected child abuse are guaranteedconfidentiality, but Pitts said he wanted his name publicized sopeople will ``know not to do it around me.''   ``I feel protective about all kids,'' said the 56-year-olddisabled veteran, who has four adopted grandchildren.   ``We had a gut feeling something was wrong, but couldn't proveit,'' he said. ``The first time I knew ... I went to theauthorities.''   ``We knowed something was going on, but you just don't doanything unless you know for sure,'' said Hazel Tucker.</TEXT></DOC>
