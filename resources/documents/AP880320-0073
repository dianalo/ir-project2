The federal aid, ranging from $18,000 for Delaware to $373,000for Virginia, will enable the states and district to upgrade theircrime information systems and make the information they submit tothe FBI more accurate, the bureau said.

The bureau, which is part of the Justice Department, said thenew system will enable police departments to describe the crimes intheir area more accurately and could help them reduce the number ofoffenses.   The new information that will be forwarded to the FBI willinclude the time and location of the crime, the victim-offenderrelationship, the presence or absence of a weapon and the numberand types of offenses that occurred during each criminal incident.   Police departments and others reporting crimes willcross-reference arrests to the crimes that have been committed anddistinguish between completed and attempted crimes. The definitionof rape also will be broadened to include all forcible sexualoffenses.
