Leo Melamed, Chicago Merc executive committee chairman, said at a news briefing that the panel is likely to be &quot;favorably disposed to free markets.&quot; Panel members are Burton Malkiel, a Yale University economics professor; Merton Miller, a finance professor at the University of Chicago; Myron Scholes, a Stanford University professor of finance and law; and John D. Hawke Jr., an attorney with the Washington law firm Arnold andamp; Porter.    The panel will hold its first meeting with Chicago Merc officials tomorrow.    Stock-index futures in general, and the Chicago Merc's Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index future contract in particular, have come under fire from certain regulators and legislators for possibly speeding the drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Oct. 19. </TEXT></DOC>
