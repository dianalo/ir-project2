Nine had end-to-end anastomotic repairs, two had subclavianflaps, and two had Dacron patch aortoplasties. Initial axial localizingscans (echo time, 20 msec) followed by direct sagittal scanning wereused to obtain images through the repair site. Comparison was made betweencross-sectional dimensions at, and just distal to, the site of anastomosis.There was good correlation between clinical findings, catheterizationdata, and MR imaging. MR imaging offers a useful technique to evaluatethe aorta following coarctation repair.</TEXT></DOC>
