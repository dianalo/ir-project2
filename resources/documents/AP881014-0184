No one was reported injured in the bombing at the KadugannawaRailway Station, but state-run radio said the blast prompted thegovernment to extend a curfew in the region.   The station is about 50 miles northeast of the capital, Colombo.There was no claim of responsibility, but police blamed theextremist Sinhalese People's Liberation Front, which opposes agovernment plan aimed at making peace with minority Tamils.   A senior police official said Sinhalese extremists arrived atthe station at 3 a.m., chased out all employees and then set offthe bomb.   The blast destroyed part of the station and damaged some railtracks, according to the official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity. Rail service was suspended indefinitely, he said.   After the explosion, the government extended a curfew in Kandydistrict and southern Matara district until 6 a.m. Saturday,state-run radio reported.   The curfew was imposed in Matara on Monday after anti-governmentdemonstrators clashed with security forces. At least 15 people werekilled.   On Tuesday, it was extended to the Kandy region after policeopened fire to quell a student demonstration. One student waskilled and three were injured.   A government statement issued in Colombo said Piyadasa Witharanaand H.A. Podiappuhamy, both provincial council members of thegoverning United National Party, were murdered by members of thethe People's Liberation Front.   Witharana was killed Thursday in the southern Matara districtwhile Podiappuhamy was assassinated the same day in the centralBadulla district, the statement said. Both areas are dominated bySinhalese.   The People's Liberation Front opposes a peace accord aimed atending a 5-year-old war by Tamil rebels demanding a separate nation.   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's16 million people. They claim they are oppressed by thepredominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of thepopulation.   The leaders of Sri Lanka and India signed the accord in 1987.India, Sri Lanka's northern neighbor, has a large Tamil populationof its own and mediated the agreement.   Sinhalese extremists say the accord makes too many concessionsto Tamils, and they have vowed to kill anyone who supports it.</TEXT></DOC>
