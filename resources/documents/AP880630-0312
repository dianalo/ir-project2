Expansion-orientedcompanies have their own acquisition plans, and executives nervousabout low stock prices are mulling restructurings.   But the looming question is just who is on these secret hitlists for the latter half of 1988, a period ripe for fast-pacedbuyouts.   A relatively cheap dollar is expected to keep luring foreigninvestors, while a fear of tighter regulations in the post-Reaganera should keep domestic-led takeovers rolling.   Topping it off is a plethora of companies whose share pricesremain depressed in the wake of October's stock market bloodbath,rendering them relative bargains.   Most Wall Streeters covet such opportunities and are more thanreluctant to point fingers at potential takeover or restructuringtargets.   ``People pay us for our opinions,'' said one analyst at BearStearns andamp; Co., ``so I don't want to give them to you for nothing.''   But the grapevine is abuzz with names like Texaco, Whirlpool,American Brands, McGraw-Hill and plenty more.   Using a purely numerical approach to identify targets, LindaZimbalist Smith said she searches for stocks that would jump in atakeover, restructuring or leveraged buyout. And while a companymay appear on her list today, a few ticks upward in its stock pricecould render it undesirable in an instant, according to her complexformula.   In May, Smith, head of the Greenwich, Conn.-based research firmZimbalist Smith, named 28 target companies _ including AmericanBrands, Monsanto, Whirlpool, Goodyear and Zayre _ but many of thesecompanies no longer pass her test.   Still, experts remain keen on American Brands, a company withfar-flung interests from tobacco to biscuits.   ``It is one of the ultimate consumer conglomerates, with dozensof separate companies pasted together without any synergy,'' notedMichael Metz, an analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co.   That means the company's separate parts could be spun off orsold to finance a takeover or pay shareholders a handsome dividend.For the investor, a takeover is not the only way to cash out. Anykind of restructuring or leveraged buyout is designed to boostshareholder value and put profits in the pockets of investors.   Smith conceded that American Brand's break-up value is great andthat its stock price is hampered by the cloud hanging over thetobacco industry.   A depressed stock price alone is not the only red flag on apotential target. Internal forces, such as low debt levels coupledwith higher projected earnings, also can highlight target companies.   ``You have to look at the financials of a company, the cashflow, the balance sheet, and you have to look outside directors,whether they are friends of management,'' said Metz.   Anti-takeover provisions are likely to be only a slightdeterrent to takeover offers.   There are even more subtle issues to consider. ``We look forvalues as well as a catalyst,'' said Mario Gabelli, who heads theinvestment firm Gabelli andamp; Co.   Among his so-called catalysts are ``things like divorce, death,big blocks of stock in the hands of octogenarians.''   For example, Gabelli said he is buying lots of stock in ThomasIndustries Inc., a Kentucky-based lighting manufacturer. Thecompany's founder, Lee B. Thomas, died in March, and a spokesmansaid he does not know what became of Thomas's stake in the company.   Newell Co., an Illinois home hardware concern, apparently alsolikes Thomas. Newell has picked up a 6.5 percent stake in thecompany and could serve as an important ally to a potential suitor_ if it does not make a bid of its own.   Divorce is taking its toll on R.P. Scherer Corp. Karla SchererFink, who has filed suit to divorce the company's president, hassaid she wants to sell the pharmaceuticals company in which sheholds a 33 percent stake. One investor group that controls morethan 13 percent of the company has already held talks with her andmay be jockeying for an acquisition.   If internal strife is a major criteria, nowhere is such a forcemore evident that at Texaco Inc. Despite defeating raider Carl C.Icahn in a critical proxy battle, the oil giant remains vulnerable.   Icahn's 14.9 percent stake may be for sale, giving any purchasera solid springboard for an offer. In addition, the aggressive NewYork investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which sidedwith management in the proxy battle, conceivably could push for aleveraged buyout and retain Texaco management, with whom theylikely have established a working rapport, Oppenheimer's Metz said.   One deal often turns the spotlight on an entire industry. ``Itstarts a conflagration, and investors and speculators look tomirror images and clones to see if other potential vehicles couldgo the same way,'' Metz said.   Turmoil at Texaco has turned up the heat on other oil companies,in particular Unocal Corp. and Phillips Petroleum Co. Both are``selling at large discounts considering their break-up value aswell as in terms of cash flow and the value of underlying gas andoil reserves,'' Metz said.   In the publishing industry, Macmillan Inc.'s announcedrecapitalization as a defensive measure against offers from theRobert Bass group sparked rumors that Time Inc. and McGraw-HillInc. might also be targets.   Indeed, McGraw-Hill reorganized into three new operatingcompanies in late June in what some analysts described as aprotective move. The company's stock jumped $3.62{ a share the daythe restructuring was announced.   And General Electric Co.'s acquisition of Roper Corp. turnedfresh attention to the home appliance market. Since then there hasbeen plenty of talk about Whirlpool Corp. and fellow appliancemaker Maytag Corp., including rumors that Whirlpool might make abid for Maytag.   Not all undervalued companies are targets. Most drug companies,for example, are trading at a discount but are not choicecandidates. Metz noted that these companies are undervalued in partbecause of the uncertainty surrounding the future of governmenthealth insurance plans and because the revived dollar will notbenefit their overseas sales as it did in the previous year.   But Smithkline Beckman Corp. is one pharmaceutical company whosestock is so downright depressed it just might be attractive.Smithkline's stock recently plummeted from about $54 a share to the$45 range after the company revised its earnings projectionsdownward.   Because of Eastman Kodak Co.'s megapurchase of Sterling DrugInc. earlier this year, Zimbalist Smith has the company on her``watch list.''   ``It's in line to do something to boost its stock price, andthere's a lot it can do'' now that it has more pieces to sell off,she said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday July 3</NOTE></DOC>
