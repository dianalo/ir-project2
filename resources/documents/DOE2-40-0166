The coal fuels have been specified, bench-scaletesting of combustors has shown that CWS can be burned in a 50/50 mixture,and combustion efficiency and emissions are reasonable. Initial designsof hot gas cleanup systems and the next step of component developmenthave begun. Testing will continue to optimize combustion efficiency,maximize ash removal, before the gas turbine hot section. Once componentdesigns have been completed and tested satisfactorily, full-scale subsystemsintegrating these components will be built and tested. Success in thesedevelopment activities will lead to commercialization of reliable coal-fueledgas turbine systems for application in the industrial, transportationand utility sectors in the 1990's. 12 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
