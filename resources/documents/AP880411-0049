The women, killed from September 1984 until May 1985, includedwaitresses, schoolteachers, receptionists, a bartender, a studentand a homemaker. They died of stab wounds, gunshots andstrangulation. One is missing and presumed dead.   ``It was on all our minds. It was the conversation everywhere.Everyone was wishing that some of these women would be found,''said Bernice Barker, 68, who lives across the street from thegarage apartment where one victim lived.   A multi-agency group spent more than a year investigating thedeaths and, at one point, grew to more than 40 officers. By July1985 the task force was reduced to 15 members. In mid-1986, PoliceChief Thomas Windham returned officers to their regular assignments.   Detectives conducted more than 3,000 interviews and compiled alist of 7,000 suspects, including friends, acquaintances andrelatives of victims. The investigation cost more than $1 million,Windham said.   The different slaying methods convinced police that more thanone killer was responsible, said Capt. Ben Dumas.   Police today say they have suspects in three of the slayings butlack the evidence needed to file charges. Investigators sometimesspend time after work on the case in hopes of finding leads.   Detective Curt Brannan says he often is led back to the spotwhere Sarah Ann Kashka, 15, disappeared. He said he occasionallyreturns on the same night of the week she vanished to piecetogether where she headed after leaving a friend's apartment.   ``When you go to a crime scene and see the things we do, andtalk to the family, you know the family is depending on you. It'sdifficult to spend an eight-hour shift working on the case, put itdown and go home,'' Brannan said.   Miss Kashka disappeared Dec. 30, 1984, after spending theevening with friends. She was found stabbed to death two days laternear Mountain Creek Lake in southwest Dallas County.   The slaying of Lisa Griffin was the only one solved. In October1985, Michael Wayne Goodin of Fort Worth was convicted of hermurder and was sentenced to 43 years in prison.   The reams of neatly packed information investigators collectedprovides little comfort to families, homicide Sgt. Paul Kratz said.   ``You're talking to them several times a day,'' Kratz said.``You finally get to the point there's nothing new to tell them.''</TEXT></DOC>
