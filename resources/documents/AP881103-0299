(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tyson Foods Inc. defended its $52-a-sharebuyout offer of Holly Farms Corp. Thursday hours after officers ofHolly Farms urged the company's stockholders to reject the roughly$940 million bid.   Jim Blair, a spokesman for the Springdale-based poultryprocessor, said that Holly Farms probably won't find a better offer.   ``We think that our offer is more than anyone else will pay,''Blair said. ``They now recognize that Holly Farms is for sale. Thequestion is to whom, for how much.''   But the board of the Memphis, Tenn., company disagreed.   ``The offer is inadequate and not in the best interest of thecompany and its stockholders,'' Holly Farms' board of directors saidin a statement released Thursday.   ``The board has authorized management together with the company'sfinancial and legal advisors to continue to explore alternatives toTyson Foods' offer in order to maximize value of the company'sstockholders,'' Holly Farms said.   Last month, Holly Farms rejected a Tyson offer of $45 plus aquarter share of Tyson stock for each of Holly Farms' 1.8 millionshares of Class A common stock.   Speculation over Holly Farms' decision caused the firm's stock toclimb above Tyson's offer. The stock closed at $53.25 on Tuesday and$52.88 on Wednesday.   ``Obviously, the market right now is telling us that it believesthat a higher bid will come to the table than Tyson's current $52bid,'' said Napoleon Overton, an analyst with Morgan Keegan andamp; Co.,in Memphis. Overton downplayed Wednesday's stock decline.   ``Stocks in play tend to be quite volatile within a reasonablenarrow range around the bids that are on the table,'' he said.   John McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in NewYork, said he thinks Holly Farms is looking for a white knight ``andagain if they can't find a white knight, they'll come out with theirown recapitalization program and sell it to Don Tyson as a lastresort.''   Tyson had stepped up its efforts to acquire Holly Farms bysending to shareholders tender offers made through the HollyAcquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyson.   Tyson is the nation's largest poultry producer, churning out 14million pounds of chicken meat a week. Holly Farms is a diversifiedfood company and the nation's third largest chicken company.   Tyson's offer is good until Nov. 18.</TEXT></DOC>
