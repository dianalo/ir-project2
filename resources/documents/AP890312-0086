The panel is deciding whether GAF and its vice chairman, James T.Sherwin, tried to illegally boost the share price of Union CarbideCorp. in 1986 prior to the sale of a large block of the stock.   The case is the first to reach the trial phase in a series ofprosecutions by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office emanating fromWall Street's insider trading scandals.   GAF, two subsidiaries and Sherwin were indicted last July oncharges of stock manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud andconspiracy. The company faces up to $12 million in fines whileSherwin could be sentenced to up to 40 years in jail and fined $2million.   After a six-week re-trial, the jury received the case from U.S.District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe and began deliberating Saturday,when it re-heard testimony by the government's star witness, LosAngeles broker Boyd L. Jefferies.   The jury's request Sunday was viewed as a sign that it was notpinning its decision on the credibility of Jefferies' testimony.Jefferies said Sherwin asked him to raise Union Carbide stock to $22a share or higher in October 1986.   GAF sold 5 million shares of the stock in mid-November 1986. TheWayne, N.J.-based chemicals manufacturer failed earlier that year ina takeover bid for Carbide.   Jefferies testified as part of a plea bargain with the governmentafter agreeing to plead guilty to two criminal securities lawviolations in connection with his dealings with jailed arbitragerIvan Boesky.   Jefferies is expected to testify in two key securities fraudcases later this year.</TEXT></DOC>
