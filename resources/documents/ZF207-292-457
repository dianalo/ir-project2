(product introduction).andO;Ticker:    UIS.andO;Product:   Unisys Micro A (Mainframe computer).andO;Topic:     Product IntroductionMainframe Computers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>UNISYS ACHIEVES AN INDUSTRY FIRST WITH ITS MICRO 48BIT MAINFRAME IN A DESKTOPENCLOSURE Unisys Corp claims that first day orders for its new Micro Adesktop mainframe, unveiled last week (CI No 1,097) &quot;are strong, in threedigits certainly&quot;, with the biggest single order being for 50 of the thingsfrom Banco del Atlantico of Mexico.andP;  Marking the successful completion of atwo year in-ternal development programme, Unisys claims that with the MicroA, it can now offer the smallest and cheapest mainframe in the world.andM;FeatandM;The technological feat behind the claim is the reduction of the entire UnisysA Series architecture, including its MCP/AS operating system, to a 2&quot; by 2&quot;,10-layer ceramic chip package known as the Single Chip A Series MainframeProcessor or Scamp, using CMOS technology to the equivalent of 10.3mtransistors.andP;  In addition, the company insists that the Micro A out-performsits A Series A1 entry-level model, and competes vigorously against otherobvious market rivals - models B10 and B20 of IBM's AS/400 family, and theDEC MicroVAX II and MicroVAX 2000.andP;  The new desktop mainframe, housed withinthe Unisys Personal Workstation Model 800, combines the 48-bit Scampprocessor surrounded with 2.5Mb static RAM, with 12Mb of main memory and aninput-output controller, on a standard AT-bus board that plugs in alongsidethe 80386 processor board.andP;  The 80386 processor has 1Mb on board and another2Mb on a separate board, as well as its own 20Mb Winchester which is used tostore the and OS/2 operating system and Micro A server software - and there'salso an Enhanced Graphics Adaptor board.andP;  Connection to a maximum of sevenperipheral devices is provided via a Small Computer System Interface or SCSIboard, which comes complete with a 280Mb disk drive and 150Mb cartridge tape.andO;The Micro A also features a data communications subsystem, housed on a DCHAData Communications Host Adaptor board provided by Emulex Corp.andP;  The DCHA isan 80286-based co-processor board with 512Kb of memory, which supports up tofour separate lines and three communication protocols concurrently, providingSNA and X25 links to other systems and networks.andP;  A maximum eight lines aresupported by adding a second DCHA board.andP;  The system is a true in-houseaffair, with all manufacturing currently confined to the company's RanchoBernardo semiconductor site in California.andM;AccuracyandM;&quot;In developing Scamp, we took an unprecedented step by going directly fromthe system's functional specifications to the software that laid out the chipfor fabrication,&quot; says Hollis Caswell, president of the Unisys ComputerSystems Group, adding that as a result of eliminating usual logic drawingsand related hand work, the design period was dramatically shortened, and theproject was completed in less than two years - with design accuracy increasedto the extent that the first version Scamp chip set met all designspecifications without hardware modification.andP;  As to performance, Unisysconcedes that the use of the 16-bit AT bus has forced it to slow down thespeed of the MCP/AS operating system.andM;Out-performandM;Nevertheless, in a series of RAMP-C benchmark tests designed to verify a twosecond response time and 70% processor usage, Unisys claims that the Micro Aout-performed IBM's AS/400 B20 by 8%, and the B10 by as much as 40%.andP;  As aquick guide, Unisys says that when supporting 16 concurrent on-line users andanother three doing development, the Micro A performs at the average rate of10,000 transactions an hour.andP;  Moreover, it ccan also be used as a 16MHz80386-based personal computer running OS/2 - and guesting MS-DOS applicationsif required, when the Micro A CPU is not being used.andP;  It can't run OS/2applications concurrently with MCP ones - when MCP is running, OS/2 is toopreoccupied providing it with service.andP;  Speaking at the launch, A SeriesEntry Level Systems senior marketing manager Simon Joles said that the MicroA offered, &quot;a mainframe-functionality-at-micro-prices alternative to themini-computer marketplace&quot;.andP;  Worldwide, Unisys says the $25,000-to-$99,000sector has garnered some 1m users, and is forecast to grow at an annual 14%between now and 1991, all of which, based on sales of the earlier entry levelA Series mainframes, leads Unisys to believe the Micro A could capture asmuch as 40% of its sales from new users.andP;  In the UK, Unisys plans to targetthe Micro A at its existing A Series user base, where it looks for asignificant of sales of 40 to 50 Micro As at a time.andM;New businessandM;According to Unisys marketing chief Simon Joles, the A-series user base hasgrown by 40% over the last four years, with some 40% of customers generatedby new business.andP;  In addition, Unisys is negotiating with a number ofunspecified third party resellers, with particular emphasis being placed onthe provision of increased automation capabilities.andP;  According to Joles,however, the introduction last year of a Menu Assisted Resource Control orMRAC facility across the MCP range, means that  ease-of-use is an issue whichhas already been tackled.andP;  Long-term, Joles anticipates that the majority ofthe systems sold will be used on self-supporting, remote site basis.andP;  Indeed,key Micro A selling points include its distributed processing potential,together with its ability to reduce costs by enabling application developmentto take place away from the mainframe.andP;  UK price for the Micro A is #25,000,which includes pre-loaded operating system software, and the Linc IIapplications generator.andP;  In the US, the Micro A costs $20,365 with CPU,keyboard and monochrome monitor and the extended term plan license for theMCP-AS operating system is $5,000 and includes Microsoft's OS/2.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
