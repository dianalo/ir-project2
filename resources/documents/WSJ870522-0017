The move implies moderate energy prices for the next few years.    ---   Citicorp expects to cut its loans to debtor nations by as much as a third -- or $5 billion -- over the next three years.

The stock closed unchanged at $37.50 in active trading.    ---   Beatrice's Kelly said he hopes to make an acquisition of at least $5 billion this year. He didn't cite any prospective targets but said food companies are the top candidates.    ---   Zayre plans to sell part of its specialty-store business in a public offering that could total about $200 million.
