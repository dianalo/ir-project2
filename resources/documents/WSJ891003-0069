Under the regulatory structure created in the Sandamp;L legislation enacted in August, thrifts will pay 1/315th of 1% of their assets to finance the operations of the newly created Office of Thrift Supervision. The assessment will raise $42.3 million for the agency's operating expenses through the end of the year, and will establish a capital fund to offset future fluctuations in the assessment.    For more than 60% of the industry, the assessment will be less than $5,000, said the Office of Thrift Supervision.    The fee, which wasn't specifically set by the legislation, was roughly what industry officials expected, although they had braced themselves for other assessments.    &quot;This could go up,&quot; said James Grohl of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, a trade group based in Washington. &quot;Every time we turn around, another shoe drops.&quot; Thrifts will also pay insurance premiums to the new Savings Association Insurance Fund, which will be 23 cents for every $100 in deposits beginning in January 1991. </TEXT></DOC>
