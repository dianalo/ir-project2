Wetherefore investigated the influence of rabbit blood platelets irradiatedat /sup 60/Co-{gamma} ray (1.8 Gy/min). I. Platelet function was investigatedin both its aggregation and release reaction. Platelet aggregation acceleratedfrom 5 Gy to 30 Gy, declining from 50 Gy to 200 Gy. The release reactionincreased up to 30 Gy, showing an especially large increase of 29 % at10 Gy. Conversely, a decrease of 30 % was evidenced at 200 Gy. II. Laboratorytests on malondialdehyde (MDA) amounts produced by lipid peroxidationof inter platelets modified by gamma radiation, MDA amounts in irradiatedplatelets increased by 19.6 % at 10 Gy, but decreased by 89 % at 200Gy. Further, the Ca/sup ++/ amount increased by 26 % at 10 Gy, decreasingat 100 Gy and 200 Gy of irradiation. III. SEM observations showed a slightswelling and rounding of platelets irradiated at 10 Gy ; an expansionof the aperture of the open canalicular system was revealed on the surfaceirradiated at 200 Gy. TEM observations showed a slight disappearanceof microtubules at 10 Gy of irradiation, while a similar expansion ofthe open canalicular system in inter platelets irradiated at 200 Gy wasvisible. From the results obtained, it seems reasonable to infer thatthe changes in function and metabolism are related to the change in thestructure of blood platelets following /sup 60/Co-{gamma} irradiation.</TEXT></DOC>
