On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 83 centsto $18.25 a barrel, breaking through what analysts said was acrucial technical barrier at $18. The contract closed at $17.42 onTuesday. Other contract months also rose.   The jump in crude prices helped pull up refined product prices,traders said. Unleaded gasoline scheduled for release next monthrose 1.44 cents to close the day at 48.77 cents a gallon, whileheating oil increased 1.36 cents to 48.74 cents a gallon. Contractsfor delivery after March also rose.   Traders said the market opened higher but slid early despite aweekly American Petroleum Institute report showing that crude oilstocks fell 7.6 million barrels a day last week. The report provedneutral for the market because it offset the previous week'sstatistics that showed a 7 million barrel rise in crude inventories.   About midday, a report quoting a representative of a non-OPECobserver nation rallied the market, said Nauman Barakat, vicepresident of energy investments at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   The report said a group of producers outside the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries is considering a 300,000 barrel-a-daycut in output.   ``The report indicated it's a deal already done,'' Barakat said.He said such an agreement would be formalized at a meeting next week.   The non-OPEC group is scheduled to meet in London on Monday andTuesday. A similar meeting last month adjourned without producing anaccord, but the group issued a statement saying it supported recentcutbacks by OPEC.   Wednesday's energy prices also got a lift from a report thatLouisiana oil field pipes are contaminated, said Andrew Lebow,senior broker and analyst with E.D.andamp;F. Man International Futures Inc.   Louisiana state officials said there was no contamination ofstocks. The rumors most likely were sparked by state environmentalofficials' plans to adopt emergency rules for storage and handlingof oil field pipe that has been contaminated after use inradioactive soil.   The state's Department of Environmental Quality is enactingemergency rules next week for the pipes until formal rules can beadopted in about 120 days.   Lebow said the report was bullish because it led to concernsabout possible production cutbacks.</TEXT></DOC>
