Isuzu Motors Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Inc. said yesterday that they will spend $480 million to build a car and truck plant in Lafayette, a city of 121,000 people in the western part of the state.    The companies announced in May their intention to locate a plant in the U.S., touching off competition by cities to land the plant. Lafayette, which will contribute tax breaks, land and other incentives valued at $86 million, was chosen over numerous other cities, including Springfield, Ill. The plant eventually is expected to employ 1,700.    The alliance between the two Japanese auto makers raised eyebrows last spring when it was announced. Isuzu is 39% owned by General Motors Corp. and sells Isuzu-built cars under the GM name in the U.S. Fuji is part of the Nissan Motor Co. group.    Isuzu and Fuji joined forces to dilute the huge risk of being among the last big Japanese car and truck builders to stake out production facilities in America. The presence of big Japanese car makers is expected to trigger a surge in the supply of Japanese cars in the U.S. by 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
