The 85-year-old restaurant owner was among hundreds of shopowners, hotel managers and restaurant operators in Ito, 60 milessouthwest of Tokyo, whose business has been hurt by thousands ofearthquakes and the eruption of an undersea volcano.   ``I have been running this place for over 40 years and businesswas never this bad,'' he said.   Since June 30, more than 22,000 quakes have jolted the hotsprings resort, including more than 585 strong enough to be felt byhumans. Twenty-one people suffered minor injuries when twoearthquakes registering 5.5 on the Richter scale hit Ito on Sunday.   On Thursday evening, a volcano onthe ocean floor off Ito erupted,spewing white steam into the air.   The hundreds of hotels in the area are virtually empty, althoughsome of the rooms are being filled by reporters.   ``The irony is that this town earned its fame from its rich hotsprings derived from volcanic activity,'' said one middle-aged shopowner, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Now, the volcanicactivity is hurting the tourism industry.''   More earthquakes and volcanic tremors jolted the Ito area onFriday, but no injuries were reported. Scores of dead fish andvolcanic stones were scattered along the shore.   ``On an ordinary Friday afternoon, this beach is always packedand most restaurants around here are full,'' said Inoue. ``But I'veonly had one customer so far today.''   News reports Friday said two undersea mounds were found near theeruption site, a few miles from Ito. One was about 80 feet high andthe other about 30 feet, the reports said.   Most of the 200 people who left their seaside houses after theeruption to spend the night in four Buddhist temples and schoolsreturned home Friday, but 43 schools in Ito remained closed, saidMasaaki Mitsuhashi, a spokesman for the city.   The government's Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Predictionsaid another eruption was highly likely to occur, not only at thesame spot but possibly at other locations.   When the 72,000 residents began to experience temblors in recentweeks, its 916 hotels and inns began receiving a stream ofcancellations. After the eruption Thursday, more than 95 percent ofhotel reservations were canceled, said Hiroyuki Yamashita of Ito'stourist bureau.   The Japanese archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, isbelieved to have about 80 active volcanoes. In January, MountTokachi, on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, erupted severaltimes.</TEXT></DOC>
