Administration officials say the budget proposal to be released Jan. 5 will include a plan to raise about $600 million in revenues in fiscal 1988 by selling the &quot;airwaves&quot; used in certain mobile communication systems.    James Miller, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said the proposal will involve the sale of frequencies used for paging devices and for certain cellular phones. Such frequencies now are distributed by choosing the best among applicants, or by lottery.    &quot;What you have currently is a classic case of excess demand,&quot; Mr. Miller said. &quot;At a zero price, many more people want the resource than can use it.&quot; By auctioning the frequencies, he said, the administration will be able to ensure they go to &quot;those people who value the resource most.&quot;    Federal Communications Commission Chairman Mark Fowler said he proposed the idea, adding that the FCC estimated it could raise as much as $1 billion in fiscal 1988. Administration budget estimators, however, apparently have decided on a lower figure. Mr. Fowler acknowledged that all such estimates are &quot;educated guesses.&quot;    But the proposal, which requires congressional approval, has a slim chance of succeeding. It signals White House desperation at trying to close the huge budget deficit, estimated at $160 billion for fiscal 1988, without new budget cuts. Mr. Fowler long has championed auctions and user fees as a way to raise revenue, but broadcasters and other license holders have defeated his proposals.    The proposal calls for auctioning radio frequencies that would be used primarily for satellite communications and, to a lesser degree, for such land-mobile communications as taxicab dispatch systems. Despite Mr. Miller's remarks, it was unclear whether the plan could apply to cellular and paging service frequencies, most of which already have been awarded by the FCC.    Mr. Fowler said that the proposal does exempt such politically potent groups as broadcasters and other current license holders from having to pay for frequencies they already use.    &quot;We reduced the political winds by carving them out of the deal,&quot; he said.    But Edward Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters, said that he feared the FCC proposal would set a precedent for requiring broadcasters to pay in the future for radio frequencies they now receive free. He added that broadcasters want to obtain some new frequencies, which Mr. Fowler proposes to auction, for a new service called high-definition television. That service promises to deliver television pictures of exceptional clarity.    Congressional staffers also have criticized airwave auctions because, they say, only the rich would be able to win broadcast licenses. In answer to that criticism, Mr. Fowler has proposed using part of the auction proceeds for low-interest loans to moderate-income bidders. He also would use the receipts to raise money for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.    But OMB has other plans, and instead would use the revenue for deficit reduction.    Currently, the FCC assigns new licenses either by comparing different applicants and picking the best one, or by conducting a lottery. But critics consider both methods deeply flawed. Hearing examiners tend to award licenses based on trivial differences, and FCC lotteries have been plagued by promoters who try to stack the odds in their favor, critics say.    Administration budget officials still are scrambling to complete the details of the fiscal 1988 budget proposal, which will cut an estimated $50 billion from the nation's deficit. OMB Director Mr. Miller said all budget decisions are expected to be made final today.    The budget is aimed at reducing the fiscal 1988 deficit to $108 billion, as required under the Gramm-Rudman budget law. Mr. Miller said a little more than half the $50 billion in deficit reduction will come from controlling spending, while a little less than half will come from proposals that raise revenue, such as the plan to auction off radio frequencies. </TEXT></DOC>
