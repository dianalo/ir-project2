Irving also said it would undertake a major restructuring involving asset sales and cost cuts. The bank also boosted its quarterly dividend for the second time this year, and said it would pay a special dividend if holders accepted the offer from Banca Commerciale, a large bank controlled by the Italian government.    However, the announcement generally failed to impress a number of institutional investors and arbitragers, who said Bank of New York's offer of about $64 a share appeared better because of timing and regulatory reasons.    Investors in general responded unenthusiastically. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Irving shares dropped $1, closing at $60.375.    Bank of New York -- which is offering $15 cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock per share for the 95% of Irving that it doesn't own -- said it won't raise its $1.08 billion offer. Asserting that Irving had found a &quot;white serf instead of a white knight&quot; to counter the offer, H. Rodgin Cohen, a Bank of New York attorney, asked: &quot;Why should we raise our offer when analysts say our offer already is superior?&quot;    Banca Commerciale's $617.5 million offer is conditioned upon a minimum of one-third, or about 6.25 million shares being tendered, various regulatory approvals and the election of Irving's slate of directors at the annual meeting, which has been pushed back to Saturday. If the offer is completed, Irving's 16-member board would be expanded to include four Banca Commerciale representatives.    In addition, Milan-based Banca Commerciale agreed not to acquire Irving's remaining shares outstanding for five years without the consent of a majority of other holders. It also said it won't dispose of its stake in Irving for three years.    Although the full terms of the agreement weren't available, Bank of New York officials who had seen Irving's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said the pact contained two unusual features. In one, Banca Commerciale has a full year to close its deal with Irving. In the other, the Italian bank can back out of its purchase agreement if it objects to any conditions placed on the acquisition by regulators. An Irving executive, however, said those features were &quot;customary&quot; in tender offers.    With about $60 billion in assets, Banca Commerciale is Italy's second largest bank. It is 67% owned by Istituto per la Recostruzione Industriale, a government agency. The remaining shares are held by about 36,000 investors.    As part of the restructuring, Irving said it plans to:   --Sell its 39% stake in a Swiss bank for more than $325 million and its landmark headquarters at One Wall St. for an undisclosed amount. If sufficient holders accept Banca Commerciale's offer, Irving plans to pay a $10 a share special cash dividend from the gains on the asset sales.    --Slash costs by enough to boost net income by $1.60 a share this year and by at least $2.75 a share next year. As a result, Irving raised its core earnings forecast to $10 a share, or an indicated $180 million, this year and $13 a share, or $239 million, next year. (Last year, Irving reported a net loss of $193.2 million as a result of a $450 million increase to reserves for doubtful Latin American loans. In 1986, the bank earned $128.1 million, or $6.83 a share.)    --Increase its annual common dividend 86% as of May to $4.50 a share from $2.42. This winter Irving increased its dividend to $2.42 from $2.24.    Irving said it would delay until 10 a.m. EDT Saturday its annual meeting scheduled for Thursday to give shareholders added time to consider the new offer. At the meeting, Irving shareholders will choose between a slate of directors backed by Irving management or one nominated by Bank of New York.    Bank of New York's offer is scheduled to expire Thursday, but could be extended.    In a reaction typical of many investors and analysts to the Italian bank's offer, Stanley Nabi, an investment officer at Bessemer Trust Co., one of Irving's largest holders with a stake of almost 5%, quoted an Aesop's fable: &quot;And the mountain labored and brought forth a mouse.&quot; He added that the offer falls far short of the $82-to-$107 a share value that Irving had placed on itself.    An arbitrager who asked not to be identified said, &quot;The Banca Commerciale offer just isn't as good as Bank of New York's. First, there's the time factor. How long is it going to take to get regulatory approvals for this? Secondly, they're only buying half the shares. What are the remaining shares going to trade at? They're saying that they think the shares will trade at $60 after the special dividend. That's just not feasible.&quot;    Lawrence Cohn, an analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said Banca Commerciale's offer is &quot;a competitive bid but not a better offer. The economic value of this bid is right in line with Bank of New York's offer. We value Banca Commerciale's at $62.50 to $65 a share vs. Bank of New York's at $64. It's a clever move. They've (Irving) now got a chance of winning.&quot;    In turning to Banca Commerciale, Irving is tapping a relationship dating back to 1915. Both banks are heavily involved in trade finance, and Irving has done correspondent banking services for Banca Commerciale. In fact, Irving bought its 39% stake in the Swiss bank, Banca della Svizzera, from Banca Commerciale in 1983. Last year, Bank of New York bought Long Island Trust Co. for about $280 million from Banca Commerciale.    Robert Falise, Irving's general counsel, said management views the Banca Commerciale offer as superior because, &quot;We believe a partnership with a global financial institution makes much more sense than an acquisition by a domestic one.&quot;    In Milan, Enrico Braggiotti, managing director and chief executive officer of Banca Commerciale, said the bank would raise 80% of the cash it needs for the Irving offer from proceeds of the sale of Long Island Trust, and the pending sale of its stake in Mediobanca S.p.A., a government-owned merchant bank scheduled to be sold to private investors.    Irving first approached Banca Commerciale about an ownership stake two months ago. &quot;We are old friends,&quot; said Mr. Braggiotti. &quot;We decided to go ahead with the offer because we had the support of the bank's management.&quot;    Irving's board endorsed Banca Commerciale's tender offer at a meeting Sunday night in New York, and Banca Commerciale's board acted early Monday morning in Milan.    Mr. Braggiotti said Banca Commerciale was interested in Irving because it would &quot;give us a presence in the biggest market in the world, and it will strengthen us in Europe as well.&quot; He said he foresees cost savings in the two banks' overseas networks. In addition, he said Irving's expertise in electronic banking will aid Banca Commerciale as it automates its branches and back offices.    Separately, Irving yesterday had two setbacks in court. In one, a New York State Supreme Court judge struck down the bank's requirement that would have prevented an insurgent board elected by fewer than two-thirds of shareholders from dismantling its takeover defenses. In the other, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the Federal Reserve Board's approval for Bank of New York to merge with Irving.    In addition, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Irving said its efforts to find an alternative to the Bank of New York bid were &quot;seriously handicapped&quot; by current restrictions on interstate banking.    Irving also disclosed that, as long as Banca Commerciale holds 20% of Irving's share, it may nominate two members of the bank's five-member executive committee. If it holds a third of the bank's shares, the Italian bank can nominate the chairman of its executive committee.    ---   Laura Colby in Rome contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
