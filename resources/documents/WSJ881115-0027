A spokesman for Designhouse, which imports furniture primarly from Denmark for sale at 25 retail outlets in the Southeast, said the Norcross, Ga., company wasn't able to pay its bills. He attributed its problems primarily to the weak U.S. dollar, which makes imports costly.    The company had raised prices but encountered customer resistance, the spokesman said. Designhouse hopes to shed some of its retail outlets, trim overhead and emerge healthier from the bankruptcy proceedings, he added.    Designhouse also has been hurt by high rentals in its retail stores, the spokesman said. In the mid-1980s, when the dollar was strong, the company lost money on foreign exchange trades after getting into some bad hedging strategies, he said.    The company last reported a profit in 1984 and sales have been declining since 1986, when they hit $20.8 million. In the fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 27, Designhouse had a loss of $564,000 compared with a $113,000 loss a year earlier. Sales declined to $3.7 million from $4.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
