The west Texas city scored worst on an &quot;environmentalstress index&quot; being released today by Zero Population Growth,a nonprofit group. The index ranked U.S. cities on populationchange, air quality, water quality and availability, sewagetreatment and toxic releases.</LP><TEXT>   Reno, Nev., was next, followed by Irvine, Calif., andPhoenix, along with several surrounding cities in Arizona.The &quot;best cities&quot; for overall environmental well-being?Albany, N.Y., and Independence, Mo.   The folks in El Paso were quick to defend their city wheninformed of the dubious honor. &quot;We certainly have ourproblems, but every other city does as well,&quot; said NancyCrowson, executive director of Keep El Paso Beautiful. Shenoted that the city is in the middle of a &quot;Glad Bag-A-Thon,&quot;in which thousands of volunteers are picking up trash.   Reno Mayor Peter Sferrazza disputed the ranking of hiscity. &quot;Look at Vegas,&quot; he asserted. Zero Population did; LasVegas, Nev., tied for the fourth-worst rating with 11 othercities, including Cleveland, New York, San Diego and RanchoCucamonga, Calif.   Unlike some other monitors of the environment, ZeroPopulation Growth includes in its criteria populationchanges, which it says can aggravate problems with providingenvironmental services. Over the past decade, many of thecities named as &quot;losers&quot; had a big increase in population.&quot;When the population isn't stable, it's hard for localgovernments to make plans and take care of things,&quot; saidSusan Weber, the group's executive director. &quot;Stability is apositive for us.&quot; Cities that experience a big drop inpopulation also can suffer as the tax take shrinks, sheadded.   Zero Population Growth contends that its surveyunderscores the environmental consequences of urban andsuburban sprawl. According to the group, 78% of the U.S.population now lives in urban areas. Every day, the averageurban American uses 150 gallons of water and 3.3 pounds offood while generating nearly 120 gallons of sewage and 3.4pounds of garbage. Such growth pressures, the group says,&quot;strain the ability of cities to maintain their environmentalhealth and to provide even the most basic services to theirresidents.&quot;   By contrast, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyrates urban areas on levels of such pollutants as smog andcarbon monoxide, but doesn't measure the impact of populationchange. Its latest data paint a different picture of wherethe trouble spots are. Los Angeles, for example, is thenation's smoggiest city, according to the EPA. But in ZeroPopulation Growth's ranking of worst cities, Los Angelesdidn't even make the top 19. It got the lowest possible markon air quality and was weak on water, but fared better on theother criteria.   At the same time, Honolulu, which meets EPA standards forall of the pollutants the agency looks at, didn't make thetop 25 of &quot;best&quot; cities on the Zero Population Growth survey.   Hartford, among the winners in the group's survey, is inthe same &quot;serious&quot; smog category as El Paso, according to theEPA. On the &quot;stress&quot; index, however, the Connecticut cityscored poorly on air quality but posted good marks in theother categories.   Zero Population Growth, based in Washington, looked at 204cities -- all of those with populations of 100,000 orgreater, plus the biggest city in each of the nine statesthat has no city that big. Twelve of the 19 losers were inCalifornia or Arizona, two fast-growing states.   In addition to stable population, small proved better thanbig. The average population of the losers was 705,888, morethan triple the winners' average population of 201,424.   Midwest and New England cities tended to do the best.Top-ranked Albany earned its highest mark on populationstability, while also scoring well on water quality andavailability, sewage treatment and toxic releases. &quot;We takeenough hits about the Rust Belt and the tired old Northeast,&quot;gloated Mayor Thomas Whalen. &quot;Older is better, and theNortheast is better.&quot;   On the negative side, Zero Population Growth's Ms. Webercalled Phoenix's poor showing &quot;just amazing. People went outthere to get the clean air.&quot; According to the group, Phoenixexperienced a big population gain, and scored poorly on airquality and water quality and availability.   As far as the EPA is concerned, Phoenix doesn't have asmog problem but does violate federal standards for carbonmonoxide and particulate matter. Warren Freas, an EPAstatistician in Research Triangle Park, N.C., explained thatthe mountains around Phoenix tend to trap the pollution thatis created.   In Phoenix, officials hotly contested the city's poorshowing in the Zero Population study, saying that the grouprelied on old or incomplete data that overstated the area'sair-pollution problem and failed to recognize big gains inwater quality. &quot;The city is not pleased,&quot; said Karen O'Regan,Phoenix's environmental programs manager.   Zero Population conceded that Phoenix's air qualityranking was made worse because data for two pollutantsweren't available. The group said the rankings were based onthe latest information available when it compiled the study.   Reno Mayor Sferrazza said his city has been aggressiveabout growth-control measures, with the result that it is oneof the slowest-growing cities in one of the fastest-growingstates. &quot;Our growth rate is under 3% a year, whereas othercities like Vegas have grown in excess of 7% a year,&quot; hesaid.   Among other efforts, he said, Reno has placed strictcontrols on wood-burning fireplaces, has rezoned the city tolimit areas where hotel casinos can expand and hasestablished a recycling program.   El Paso's Ms. Crowson conceded that the city's populationhas grown recently and that its air pollution problem is madeworse because it is in a valley. But she said that El Paso&quot;is working very hard&quot; to deal with the problems.   Water treatment has improved recently, she contended, andthe city recently put in place some water conservationmeasures. She said that two outlying developments that wereput up without proper sewage &quot;aren't even in El Paso. In mostareas of the city, there is no problem with the quality ofwater.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
