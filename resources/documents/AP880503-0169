(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Authorities accused a computer operatorfrom a company that helps run the state lottery of forging awinning $15.2 million ticket and another man with trading it in forthe jackpot.   Mark S. Herbst, 33 of Harrisburg, was arraigned Tuesday, lessthan a week after he traded in the ticket for the first $469,989installment of the prize from a Super 7 drawing last July 15. Hewas jailed in lieu of $50,000 bail.   Jailed in lieu of bail Monday night was computer operator HenryArthur Rich, also 33 of Harrisburg, who tried to flee, arrestingofficers said.   Both men were charged with theft by unlawful taking, theft bydeception, criminal conspiracy and forgery, said Robert Gentzel, aspokesman for state Attorney General LeRoy Zimmerman. Rich also wascharged with unlawful use of a computer and tampering with publicinformation.   If convicted, Herbst could be jailed for up to 31 years andfined $70,000, Zimmerman said. Rich could face 40 years in prisonand $90,000 in fines.   There was ``no current evidence of participation by others, orof other fraudulent tickets being turned in, either here or in thestate of Delaware, where Rich had access to that state's mainframelottery computer,'' Zimmerman said at a news conference.   Zimmerman alleged Rich used a computer at his firm, Control DataCorp., to identify unclaimed jackpots and to print a copy of theunclaimed winning ticket, which he gave to Herbst to cash in. Hecontended Rich obtained some security codes and other informationabout the winning ticket from the lottery's main computer, which hehad access to as a troubleshooter.   Rich was responsible for troubleshooting the lotterry's maincomputer.   Spokesmen at Control Data said Tuesday they had been told by thestate Revenue Department not to comment. And Gov. Robert P. Caseysaid late in the day that he had postponed final approval of aproposed contract renewal for Control Data pending review ofsecurity safeguards.   When Herbst claimed the jackpot Thursday, he said he had beenusing the ticket as a bookmark and checked the numbers after seeinga newspaper story about the unclaimed prize.   Terri LaFleur, associate editor of Gaming and Wagering Businessmagazine, said security violations in lottery games are rarebecause of the precautions.   James Scroggins, the lottery's executive director, said some ofhis colleagues had doubts about the ticket even before Herbstreceived his check. The doubts centered on the finding that thebogus ticket was printed on a blank from a Scranton lottery-ticketoutlet, while a computer check showed the actual winner was sold inBucks County.   Scroggins said he decided to award the prize because pastdiscrepancies of that type were explained by merchants lendingblank tickets to other sellers.   Less than an hour after Herbst left a news conference, however,the officials decided the ticket wasn't real and contactedZimmerman. Later that day, the Revenue Department, which operatesthe lottery, asked Herbst's bank to stop payment on the check andstate prosecutors asked the bank to stall Herbst if he tried towithdraw the money.   Scroggins said Herbst was ``not unlike any other big winner I'dever seen. He was very nervous.''   Zimmerman said agents from his office confronted Herbst onSunday, and Herbst admitted he knew the ticket was not genuine.According to an affidavit used to obtain arrest warrants, Herbstalso told the agents Rich was expecting $5,000 from him Monday.   On Monday night, Zimmerman said, Herbst gave Rich $5,000provided to him by investigators. Rich was armed and tried to fleewhen agents moved in, but was captured without incident, Zimmermansaid.   Scroggins said additional security measures, which he refused todisclose, would have eventually uncovered the forgery.   This is the second fixing case to plague the PennsylvaniaLottery. The April 24, 1980, drawing of the Daily Number was fixedby altering pingpong balls used to pick the winning digits.   The so-called 6-6-6 case, named after the winning numbers, alsoresulted in tighter security for the televised drawings. Scrogginssaid new procedures would also be implemented because of the newcase.</TEXT></DOC>
