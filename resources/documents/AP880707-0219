(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal jury on Thursday awarded$22.6 million to the estate of now-defunct ESM GovernmentSecurities, ruling against financier Marvin Warner, whom the firmclaimed had unjustly profited from its 1985 failure.   The jury deliberated seven hours before ruling in favor of ESMon civil complaints in the lawsuit accusing Warner of fraudulentlytaking money out of the troubled securities firm when he knew thefirm was in dire financial trouble, of profiting from insiderinformation, and of loaning ESM money in exchange for profits onbogus financial transactions.   Warner's Cincinnati-based thrift, Home State Savings Bank, wasESM's biggest customer. Home State collapsed shortly after ESMfailed in 1985, triggering a savings and loan panic in Ohio.   Warner, 69, said he would appeal. He was visibly upset when heheard the verdict and said: ``The jury has spoken. I'm stunned.Terribly.''   Warner's attorney, Andrew Hall, said it was ``clearly a decisionbased on court passion. Clearly the jury did not understand whatthis case was about.''   District Judge Jose Gonzalez Jr. had given the jury 22 questionsto consider and they ruled in favor of ESM Trustee Thomas Tew onevery question, including the amounts requested by the plaintiffs.   The lawsuit also had claimed Warner violated securities,racketeering and civil theft statutes and that he unjustly profitedfrom ESM's 1985 failure.   Warner won a strategic victory just before the start ofdeliberations Wednesday when Gonzalez determined the plaintiff hadnot proven Warner was involved in securities fraud.   But in Thursday's verdict, the jury found that he ``actuallyparticipated in the fraudulent purpose'' of ESM GovernmentSecurities.   Although he dismissed the fraud counts, Gonzalez did not changethe amount of damages that could be sought. The judge earlierreduced the damages sought from $62 million to $22 million.   Before the verdict, Warner said: ``Regardless of the financialoutcome, what that judge did vindicated me.''   Warner last year was acquitted of federal criminal charges butconvicted of state charges in Ohio and sentenced to three years inconnection with the collapse of Home State. He is free whileappealing that conviction.   Much of the blame for the thrift's problems was placed onWarner, who held a personal account at ESM and had encouraged HomeState to invest with the obscure Fort Lauderdale firm.   Tew's lawyers claimed Warner was an insider at ESM who demandedand was given special treatment because of Home State's hugeinvestments with ESM.   Before the verdict, Tew said he was disappointed by thedismissal of the fraud counts but that the damage to his suit wasminimal.   Hall said the dismissal of the four fraud counts supported hisclaim that Warner was a victim, and not a perpetrator, of fraud atESM.   ``The largest single victim of ESM's fraud is Marvin Warner,''Hall said in closing arguments. ``If you are a victim, how can yoube an insider.''   As evidence, Hall repeatedly reminded jurors that Warnercontinued to invest money and real estate with ESM after allegedlylearning of the firm's troubles.   But Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, the attorney for Tew, argued thatWarner had to keep investing in ESM because ESM and Home State weredependent on each other for survival.</TEXT></DOC>
