The designer has tofulfil these demands without letting the design to become too inefficient.Since no ready design procedures are available he has to resort to intuitioncalculation and modelling. In spite of this there may be wide discrepancybetween the design values and the actual results. This report describesthe experience gained on two 'C' core electromagnets being used by authors.These magnets generate low magnetic fields over reasonably large volumes,a requirement that runs opposite to that of most other magnets. The studyreveals the dependence of overall performance efficiency, field uniformityetc. on the design parameters. 31 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
