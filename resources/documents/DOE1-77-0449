In some isolated locations wind or solar energy mayalso be utilised to save fuel costs. For the consumer contemplating theinstallation of such a system, the major concerns may be the optimalsizes for each component to satisfy a given load profile and the costingof alternate systems in a consistent framework. Recently, the Departmentof Resources and Energy commissioned the development of a computer modelto facilitate the design, sizing and operation of Remote Area Power Supply(RAPS) systems. The stochastic dynamic programming model RAPSODY is capableof simulating the operation of systems which use various combinationsof renewable energy sources, conventional generating plant and batterystorage systems, taking into account the variability of the renewableenergy source.</TEXT></DOC>
