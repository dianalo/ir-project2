In the other corner is the plodding ``Inside Edition,'' aknockoff of Fox's ``A Current Affair'' that King World hopes willknock ``USA Today'' out of the ring.   The decisive round between the two syndicated shows is expectedduring the February sweeps when local ratings are measured.   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' barely survived the Novembersweeps and has suffered station defections and time changes,sometimes in favor of the new ``Inside Edition'' and the old ``ACurrent Affair.''   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' premiered last fall aftermonths of hype and a $40 million investment by the Gannett Co. inpartnership with Grant Tinker. The producers promisedstate-of-the-art graphics and a format that would change the face oftelevision news. In retrospect, there was no way the show could liveup to expectations _ but it wasn't expected to be so bad, either.   Overproduced and whizzing by at a frantic pace, its anchormen andwomen were stranded on an unpopulated, space-age set, talking todisembodied images on big-screen television monitors.   The new version is much better. Brief updates on stories of theday are delivered by grounded anchors who have been allowed to sitdown _ phew! _ behind a desk that does not spin, gyrate or sproutstatistics.   Its light-hearted features benefit from the impressive graphics.The flash and the likable, telegenic hosts remain. If this were theshow that had premiered in September, it still wouldn't have livedup to the build-up, but reviews would not have been nearly sonegative.   But those negative reviews did hit newsstands, and King World,the successful syndicator of ``Wheel of Fortune,'' ``The OprahWinfrey Show'' and ``Jeopardy!'' soon thereafter announced it wasgunning for ``USA Today: The Television Show'' with ``InsideEdition,'' to premiere in January.   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' had proven there was a marketfor a syndicated newsmagazine. It had sold in 95 percent of thecountry weeks before a single show was produced, thanks to the castbehind the scenes _ former NBC Chairman Tinker, Gannett, and formerNBC ``Today'' show executive producer Steve Friedman.   When the show fell flat, King World figured to step in and pickup the market.   But GTG stuck by the show, hired Jim Bellows as new executiveproducer and announced a massive repromotion _ at a cost of $4million _ to herald the re-created program.   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' is far from the the sure thingit once seemed. ``Inside Edition'' has been picked up as a midseasonreplacement in markets covering 71 percent of the country.   The Kings enlisted the producers of ``A Current Affair'' andhired well-known TV personality David Frost as host.   But ``Inside Edition'' wasn't exactly impressive in its premiere,either. In comparison to ``USA Today: The Television Show,'' the setlooked like community-access cable. The content was a mish-mash ofpreviously covered sob stories. Frost concluded the show with anembarrassing promise of ``no three-headed babies, no programsdevoted to issues like, should one-legged lesbians be allowed toadopt ferrets, no sex surveys, and hopefully, no broken noses forthe host.''   If ``Inside Edition'' is wavering, the new ``USA Today: TheTelevision Show'' has settled down.   ``Welcome to the new look of `USA Today on TV,''' said co-hostBill Macatee as the show re-premiered on Jan. 9. ``A new look for anew year.''   Several of the pieces were an amazing several minutes long _documentary-length by the standards of the original version. Theywere pleasant to look at if they were largely mindless. Agarden-variety feature on preparations for the inauguration includeda pointless film clip from the movie ``No Way Out.'' Another featuredelivered the news flash that car stereos louder than a speedinglocomotive are bad for drivers and other living things.   But the show is at least watchable now. What remains to be seenis whether the improvements are too late. Many stations moved ``USAToday: The Television Show'' into low-rated late-night and gave``Inside Edition'' the coveted time period just before prime time.In the New York television market, ``Inside Edition'' premiered onthe NBC-owned station at 7:30 p.m. ``USA Today: The TelevisionShow'' has languished since September at 2 a.m. on the CBS station.   Neither ``Inside Edition'' nor ``USA Today: The Television Show''can claim to be great journalism. ``USA Today: The Television Show''has at least tried to do something new.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   ON SECOND THOUGHT _ Vanna White has been booked as a guest on PatSajak's new CBS talk show for Jan. 23. Sajak promises sparks willfly. ``Once when I was guest-hosting a local L.A. talk show,'' quothSajak in CBS press material, ``they brought Vanna on to surprise me,and it's funny _ we spend so much time together and know each otherso well, we really didn't have anything to talk about.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed PMs, Jan. 18</NOTE></DOC>
