The smoke of civil rage curling out of apredominantly black neighborhood. Miami's twin crises.   While the dozens of Nicaraguan refugees arriving daily and racialdisturbances in the city's Overtown area had the Super Bowl hostcity's promoters fretting about Miami's image, community leaderswere more concerned with the threat of ethnic divisions.   For some leaders, particularly those in the black community,there were disturbing similarities to 1980, when the Mariel Boatliftoverwhelmed Miami with 100,000 Cuban refugees and racial tensionstwice flared into violence in black neighborhoods.   Tensions were simmering among some blacks over perceived unjusttreatment from police and feelings of frustration over perceiveduneven treatment given the Nicaraguans, community leaders said.   The hoopla over Super Bowl, with the city showing off its newskyline, new bayside attractions and improved image may have addedto disaffection, and the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist bypolice Monday evening provided the spark, they said.   ``There have been a lot of other tensions the last few weeks.They just needed a catalyst,'' said state Rep. James Burke. ``Thesepeople involved could care less about the Super Bowl being here.It's not going to help their lives.''   ``It's really close to what happened before in 1980,'' said GarthReeves, long-time publisher of the black-oriented newspaper TheMiami Times.   His newspaper in recent weeks reported complaints that policewere being particularly violent with blacks, while resentment wasrising over the influx of Nicaraguans, coming here by bus at 200 aday.   ``This incident is unfortunate,'' Reeves said of the shooting,adding: ``There's reaction from the influx of Nicaraguan refugees,these people coming in and getting jobs that a lot of young blacksclaim are not open to them.''   In late April 1980, Cuban President Fidel Castro opened the Portof Mariel to boats from Florida, and some 125,000 Cubans arrived inless than five months. Placed initially in tent cities, most settledin the Miami area. On May 18 that year, the acquittal of Metro-Dadepolice officers charged with beating a black motorcyclist to deathsparked three days of riots that claimed 18 lives and hundreds ofmillions of dollars in damage.   Less than two months later, more racial disturbances flared forthree days after an incident between police and blacks.   Three more days of violent disturbances erupted in December 1982after police fatally shot a black youth, and street violence flaredagain when the Cuban-born officer was acquitted of manslaughter inthat case. More than 200 arrests were made.   As in 1980, when some blacks felt the Miami community, whoselargest ethnic group now is the Cubans with one-third of DadeCounty's population, was making a special effort to welcome theMariel refugees, some blacks are now resenting what they see asopen-arms treatment for Nicaraguans refugees being housed at theMiami baseball stadium and other community shelters.   ``The African-Americans have felt cheated,'' said JohnnieMcMillian, president of the Miami branch of the National Associationfor Advancement of Colored People. ``We felt we were losing ourplace in the city.''   Gerard Jean-Juste, a fiery leader in the Haitian community thatnumbers some 100,000 in South Florida _ about the same as theNicaraguan exile community _ said the Nicaraguan influx underlineswhat he calls racist U.S. treatment of Haitians. Since 1981, CoastGuard patrols have intercepted Haitians immigration authorities sayare coming here for economic, not political, reasons.   ``They interdict the Haitians at sea ... and they meanwhile offerthe red-carpet treatment to Nicaraguans,'' Jean-Juste said.   Xavier Suarez, Miami's Cuban-born mayor, expressed disappointmentover the violence, while saying its Super Bowl week timing wasn'this biggest worry now.   ``Obviously, any incident of this sort affects Miami's image,''Suarez said. ``The timing is always bad.''   The second-term mayor said he had been trying to ease Overtown'sproblems.   ``That's also the area in which the city has been making itsgreatest effort with the largest urban renewal project, affordablehousing, possibly in the entire nation,'' Suarez said.   Others say the city could do more.   Burke, who was on a 1980 commission that studied the riotaftermath, noted that county voters last year rejected a proposalfor a juvenile welfare board aimed at helping black youths stay inschool or get jobs.   ``The young black males are the ones you see involved in this.Those are the people you would have reached,'' Burke said. ``Theanswers are there. Unfortunately, 1980 has been too far away forsome people to care about anymore.''</TEXT></DOC>
