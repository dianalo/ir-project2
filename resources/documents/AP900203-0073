ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrats will have to decide between majormeetings next month in New Orleans or Indianapolis, and the rivalryhas more to do with philosophy than a preference for porktenderloin or jambalaya.   For party chairman Ronald H. Brown and the members of theDemocratic National Committee, the choice was easy. They're goingto Indianapolis to showcase Indiana's youthful Democratic governor,Evan Bayh, and tout their chances of capturing the Senate seat onceheld by Vice President Dan Quayle.   Another large group of Democrats, including many of the party'sleading officeholders, will convene at the same time in New Orleans.   Somehow _ and nobody is willing to call it anything but anaccident _ the DNC and the Democratic Leadership Council chose thesame dates the last week in March for their meetings.   ``It was not some deliberate picking a fight,'' said Brown whenasked about the conflict. ``When we set the date, I didn't knowabout the DLC meeting.''   ``As far as I know it was inadvertent,'' said DLC executivedirector Al From, who went on to suggest that the most importantparty business would take place in New Orleans.   ``They're (the DNC) not going to do anything,'' he said. ``It'sa routine business meeting as opposed to something that might bereally spectacular.''   From said the DLC, formed in 1985 by elected officials concernedabout what they perceived as the national party's leftward drift,would spend its time in New Orleans discussing an agenda for the'90s ``that will lead this party and the country in a differentdirection.''   He said that at the DNC sessions ``the same old activists gettogether and dance on the same ground that people lose on everytime.''   Brown will not ignore the DLC. He plans to address its closingsession, and deliver a tough message calling on its members to stopbashing the national party.   ``I'd be less than honest if I didn't think that some of thespeeches that I've heard recently are just kind of gratuitous,''said the party chairman.   He declined to specify which speeches bothered him. But anattack on national Democrats by Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., seemed tofit the bill.   Robb told a DLC meeting that Democrats were in ``a quandarybecause we have difficulty conceiving of our mission in terms otherthan federal activism.''   The senator, a former chairman of the DLC and one of itsfounding members, described the party as ``in thrall to the specialinterests.''   Brown made it clear he was tired of attacks on the nationalparty.   ``We've been moving in a pretty solid, pragmatic, common-sensedirection this year and I think everybody acknowledges that,'' hesaid ``So when folks attack the national party I don't know whothey're talking about.''   The chairman said the message he wanted to deliver to the DLCwas that while they and the DNC don't always agree ``we'recertainly moving in the same direction.''   Shortly after he was elected party chairman last year, Brownattended a DLC meeting and said pointedly that ``I know there aremany in this room who were less than wildly enthusiastic about theprospect of Ron Brown being chairman of the Democratic NationalCommittee.''   For Brown, the political attraction of Indianapolis was clear.Party leaders view 34-year-old Bayh, the first Democratic governorof Indiana in 16 years, as a rising star. They also have their eyesset on Republican Sen. Dan Coats, appointed last year to replaceQuayle. Coats has yet to be tested in a statewide race.   While the DLC will talk issues, the DNC members will discuss therules for selecting the 1992 presidential nominee. No major changesare foreseen.   But the DNC remains the party's governing body, a fact pointedout to From, who responded, ``That is true. They are, at least atthe moment.''</TEXT></DOC>
