ZimmermanandM;Reporters for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty Inc. in Eastern Europe and theSoviet Union are now able to transmit their stories to company headquartersmore quickly and efficiently, thanks to the company's recent standardizationon Microcom Inc.'s LAN bridges, said RFE officials last week.andM;The six MLB\6000 bridges, installed in RFE bureaus in Washington, New Yorkand Munich this past September, connect the company's geographicallydispersed and dissimilar networks to a fiber-optic backbone to provide thenews organization with fast and error-free communications.andM;&quot;Before we got the MLBs, we were running DECnet with a DEC server at 19.2Kbps,&quot; said Robert De Toro, assistant director of network services in theinformation systems division at RFE in Munich.andP;  &quot;It was a high-speedinterface, but we could only use DECnet.andP;  Now with the MLBs, it's virtuallytransparent to protocols, so we can run on anythingike TCP/IP, X.25,whatevernd do it at 128K [bps].&quot;andM;Approximately 1,200 people in about a dozen international RFE news bureausrunning on Ethernet, Token-ring and AppleTalk LANs access the RFE/RL networkdaily via X.25 or TCP/IP links for local and transatlantic transmissions,said De Toro.andM;To ensure data integrity, RFE installed two MLBs each at its Washington, NewYork and Munich bureaus.andP;  Should the connection to the primary bridge fail,the transmission is automatically rerouted to the backup bridge.andM;RFE evaluated bridges from Vitalink Communications Corp., Timeplex Inc., RADData Communications Inc. and Wellfleet Communications Inc. before deciding onMicrocom's products, said De Toro.andM;&quot;The others, especially the Wellfleet bridges, were too complex and costly,&quot;De Toro said.andP;  &quot;I hate to use these terms, but [the Microcom bridges] arereally plug-and-play and they're very user-friendly.&quot;andM;The MLB\6000 is a PC-based private-line bridge that features proprietarycompression to boost its 64K-bps throughput rate to 128K bps.andP;  The bridge isalso protocol-independent, enabling users to run such protocols as TCP/IP,ISO, DECnet and IPX.andP;  The MLB\6000 ranges in price from $3,999 for anEthernet version that includes a wide area network card, LAN card, interfacecables and software, to a turnkey system including a 286 PC, monitor andkeyboard as well as the bridge cards and software for $5,999.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
