ShererandM;Direct Technology Ltd. will preview a new tool at next month's Comdex tradeshow that lets IS professionals automate tasks across multiple MicrosoftWindows applications, said sources close to the company.andM;Similar to a facility that Hewlett-Packard Co. is touting for itsWindows-based NewWave graphical environment, Direct Technology's Automatorfor Windows provides a set of scripting language facilities for buildingprocedures, or &quot;agents,&quot; to handle cross-application tasks, the sources said.andM;While NewWave demands that applications be written specifically for it,Automator will work with standard Windows applications, they added.andM;With Automator for Windows, a manager could, for example, create a systemthat lets salespeople in regional offices upload their weekly sales forecastsevery Friday at 4:30.andP;  In this scenario, an Automator &quot;agent&quot; would kick inat the specified time, prompt the salesperson to give the name of theforecast file, load communications software, dial up the mainframe and uploadthe forecast.andM;Direct Technology, a British firm with U.S.andP;  headquarters in New York, willship Automator by the end of this year, sources said.andP;  Company officialsdeclined to comment on the product.andM;Microsoft Corp. plans to build a cross-application macro language into itsWindows applications that will provide functionality similar to Automator's.andO;This facility can be used with third-party applications only if it is builtinto the software, sources said.andP;  Also, Softbridge Microsystems Corp. inCambridge, Mass., offers a similar tool.andM;Automator for Windows has two components: Workshop, which provides thefacilities to build agents; and Mission Control, the module in which managersset up the conditions that determine how and when agents are invoked.andP;  Userswrite agents in Automator's proprietary scripting language, or use thelanguage to modify agents created by several code generators found in theprogram, sources said.andM;The Mission Control module lets managers assign triggers -- for example, aspecified time, keyboard or screen event -- to set off particular agents,they said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
