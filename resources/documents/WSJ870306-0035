The 17-page policy document represents campaign material in what's expected to be an election year. The Labor Party, which isn't expected to topple the ruling Conservative government, is drawing political ammunition from recent City scandals.    Among other things, the Labor Party would turn the Securities and Investment Board, the securities industry's new self-regulating watchdog, into a government agency that would be able to cancel financial-services companies' licenses. The SIB, set up about 19 months ago, isn't fully operational yet.    The party also said that it wanted a reshaped SIB to take over responsibility for investigating insider trading from the government's Department of Trade and Industry, and to assume supervision of the Lloyd's of London insurance market.    The Takeover Panel, another self-regulatory body, also should come under the SIB's control, according to the Labor Party document. The proposal accused the Takeover Panel of weakness both in investigating takeover abuse and in applying sanctions.    Anthony Nelson, a Conservative member of Parliament, roundly criticized the Labor Party's proposal. &quot;The balance that the government is trying to seek between statutory regulation and self regulation should be met with some sympathy,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
