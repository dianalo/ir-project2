In such cases, stand-alone power systems arerequired. For oil-deficient developing countries like India, wind energyis a desirable alternative. With the development of new materials, innovativetechnologies and engineering concepts, advanced switching devices andmicroprocessor controls, it is now possible to demonstrate wind/flywheelintegration as a viable option. MECON is now actively working on sucha scheme to supply an uninterrupted energy load of 40 to 50 MWh per year,and expect to have the first unit operational by Summer 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
