Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> PSY U.GME </CO><IN> FIN TNM FOD RFD </IN><TEXT>   A law firm's successful efforts on behalf of the Rales brothers to enjoin Interco Inc. from using its poison pill to fend off a hostile bidder appear to have limited the options of another client -- Pillsbury Co. -- to defend itself against an unwanted takeover.    The dilemma that the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom faces is an uncommon one: The firm represents two clients that are likely to take opposing positions at the same time in Delaware courts with respect to the same issue -- poison pills. Poison pills are anti-takeover provisions designed to make companies unpalatably expensive to a hostile acquirer.    But legal experts say that while law firms don't often have to be on both sides of an issue at once, Skadden's involvement in the two battles presents more of an embarrassment for the firm than it does an ethical conflict.    &quot;A lawyer's duty of loyalty to a client does not include a promise never to take a position on a matter inconsistent with the client's position,&quot; said Stephen Gillers, a legal-ethics specialist who teaches at New York University's law school. &quot;When you sign on with Skadden in the takeover field as a client, you have to know they may be making legal arguments for other clients that will hurt you.&quot;    Early last week, Skadden lawyers scored a major victory when a Delaware Chancery Court ruled that Interco had improperly used its poison pill to defend against a $2.73 billion tender offer from an investor group led by the Rales brothers of Washington, D.C. The ruling was temporarily stayed until the state's supreme court could hear Interco's appeal later this month.    But late last week, Skadden lawyers were back in court arguing that Pillsbury shouldn't have to remove its poison pill in the face of a hostile $5.23 billion takeover bid by Grand Metropolitan PLC. Pillsbury has rejected that bid as &quot;inadequate.&quot;    Takeover attorneys said that because of the Interco case, which Skadden argued on behalf of the Raleses, Pillsbury was barred from using the common takeover defense of proposing a restructuring that could match or top the hostile bid because Skadden had convinced the court to look askance on such defenses.    In the Interco case, at Skadden's urging, the court ruled that if a company develops a restructuring of approximate value to that of a hostile tender offer, a poison pill defense can't be used to prevent shareholders from choosing between them. And when Pillsbury said on Monday it would spin off its troubled Burger King Corp. unit, it offered no estimate of the value of its plan, an apparent effort to avoid Interco's problem.    Pillsbury declines to comment on the matter. But Skadden denies that its arguments in the Interco case have harmed Pillsbury, a longtime client. &quot;We think the facts in Pillsbury are different from the facts in Interco,&quot; said Michael Goldberg, a Skadden partner who is representing both the Raleses and Pillsbury. &quot;Interco doesn't limit Pillsbury's decisions,&quot; he added.    However, Mr. Goldberg said Skadden recommended that Pillsbury hire A. Gilchrist Sparks III, a Wilmington attorney, to defend the poison pill in the Delaware courts. Skadden has its own office in Delaware, with more than 35 lawyers.    The suggestion to use Mr. Sparks instead was made, Mr. Goldberg said, because &quot;it would be improper for us as winners of Interco to argue that Interco, on the basis of its facts, was wrongly decided.&quot; Because Pillsbury may want to argue against the Interco decision, &quot;As a matter of professional judgment, we recommended Gil be brought in,&quot; Mr. Goldberg said.    Skadden has had to recommend that clients hire independent counsel in Delaware several times in the past because of apparent conflicts. When Campeau Corp. challenged Delaware's takeover statute earlier this year in connection with its successful bid for Federated Department Stores Inc., Skadden recommended that Federated hire Mr. Sparks to defend the company in Delaware because Skadden had clients on both sides of the issue.    And when Skadden fought to nullify Household International Inc.'s poison pill in 1985, it sent clients seeking to adopt pills to a host of other law firms. </TEXT></DOC>
