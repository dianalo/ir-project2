Yuri Glukhov wrote in today's edition of the Communist Partydaily Pravda that President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq had createddangerous conditions in his country through the assistance of theUnited States.   ``On Pakistani territory are dozens of bases where inveterateterrorist cut-throats train,'' Glukhov wrote.   He did not say whether he thinks the United States was directlyinvolved in Wednesday's plane crash that killed Zia and U.S.Ambassador Arnold Raphel. He said an inquiry would have to becompleted to determine whether sabotage was involved.   Zia, Raphel and 28 others died when the C-130 transport planeexploded after takeoff following a field inspection of newU.S.-built battle tanks about 30 miles west of the Indian border,near the Pakistani city of Bahawalpur.   Pakistan serves as a base for Moslem guerrillas fighting theSoviet-backed government of Afghanistan. The United States alsobacks the insurgents, and Glukhov alluded to this in a veiledaccusation against the United States.   ``There are grounds to believe that the U.S.A. played a fatalrole in Zia's fate. It is the U.S.A. that prevented Pakistan fromgetting out of a chronic crisis and achieving stability,'' thecommentator wrote.   He said without elaborating that U.S. pressure had drawnPakistan into an undeclared war against Afghanistan.   The new Pakistani president, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, has said thecrash was an act of sabotage but declined to speculate on who mightbe responsible.   Several Pakistani newspapers published unsourced reports thatofficials believed the plane was hit by a missile. Others reportedthey suspected a bomb in the cockpit. Still others said explosivesmay have been concealed in a basket of mangos.   Pravda quoted the Times of London as saying in an editorial thatif an investigation shows the crash resulted from a bomb explosion,then Afghan communists and their Soviet allies should be suspected.Glukhov said such accusations reflect the ``incompetence'' ofpeople trying to ``throw a shadow'' over Afghan and Soviet effortsto bring peace to the region.</TEXT></DOC>
