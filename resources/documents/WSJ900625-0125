Mr. Mandela, who has been drawing a flood of support andgood will on a tour of U.S. cities, has stressed the need tokeep applying pressure on South Africa's white-minoritygovernment. It is a message he pushed at a meeting of morethan 200 business leaders in New York Friday and is expectedto repeat to President Bush today.</LP><TEXT>   While the New York business leaders were divided over thecontinued use of economic sanctions, they were uniformlyimpressed with the African National Congress's deputypresident, who was freed in February after nearly 28 years inprison. &quot;The business community was very positive, and Mr.Mandela came off very, very well,&quot; said Preston Robert Tisch,president of Lowe's Corp. and the incoming chairman of theNew York Partnership.   That view was shared by Peter Farber, a tax lawyer andtrustee of the New York Chamber of Commerce, who says thatsanctions hurt black South Africans more than anyone. &quot;Heseems very well-informed about business and the economy,&quot; Mr.Farber said. &quot;He took pains to dispel the notion that therewould be wholesale nationalization of industries. Freeenterprise would play a major role, including foreigninvestment.&quot;   &quot;I come to put forth the message that sanctions must beintensified,&quot; Mr. Mandela told reporters yesterday when hetouched down at Washington National Airport.   In a speech Saturday at the Kennedy Library at theUniversity of Massachusetts in Boston Mr. Mandela called fora &quot;large inflow of foreign capital, including U.S. capital,&quot;once democracy comes to South Africa. Limited nationalizationof industry, he said, was an option to be considered.   Mr. Mandela expressed immediate interest in a proposal byPeter Goldmark, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, toestablish a South African development bank -- &quot;a place tochannel investment the minute a just government is elected,&quot;Mr. Goldmark said. &quot;There are businesses and foundations thatwould be interested in building the machinery for such abank, whether our government was ready or not,&quot; he said. Mr.Mandela indicated he would like to follow up on the bank ideabefore leaving the U.S.   Mr. Mandela has already demonstrated enormous fund-raisingprowess. Some aides estimate the amount raised so far duringhis trip at well over $1 million, with the biggestfund-raising events yet to occur. Contributions to the ANChave come from excited, emotional crowds at big gatherings,such as the huge outdoor rally Saturday, as well as atsmaller functions with the rich and famous.   During his meeting with Mr. Bush, aides said, Mr. Mandelawill insist that there is no reason to reward South AfricanPresident F.W. de Klerk for the country's recent steps towardending apartheid. &quot;Mandela will tell Bush that theinitiatives for all going on in South Africa today were bythe ANC and not de Klerk,&quot; said Lindiwe Mabuza, the ANC'sWashington representative.   Mr. Mandela is hoping that Mr. Bush will issue a statementsupporting sanctions and a quickening of the reform process.&quot;We believe Bush has the capability to put pressure on deKlerk to insure that the entire reform process is on trackand should be speeded up,&quot; Zwelakhe Sisulu, a top aide to Mr.Mandela, said in an interview yesterday.   Mr. Mandela will also ask Mr. Bush to encourage Mr. deKlerk to work to stem violence in Natal province, wherefactional warfare has been under way for years.   In addition to speaking with the president, Mr. Mandelaalso will address a joint session of Congress while inWashington. His reception on Capitol Hill tomorrow may besomewhat muted by senators and representatives whoseconstituents strongly objected to Mr. Mandela's words ofsupport for Fidel Castro, Moammar Gadhafi and Yasser Arafat-- the leaders of Cuba, Libya and the Palestine LiberationOrganization, respectively.   On a PBS special Friday, Mr. Mandela said he was&quot;astonished&quot; at the critical reaction his remarks havegenerated, explaining that the three men have long beensupporters of the ANC struggle.   ---   Meg Cox contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
