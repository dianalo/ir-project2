(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A cult leader wanted in theslayings of an Ohio family of five was arrested near the Mexicanborder by authorities who say weapons and survivalist gear werefound in his motel room and a storage locker.   Jeffrey Lundgren, 39, a former Sunday-school teacher and tourguide in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter DaySaints in Ohio, was arrested outside the motel Sunday by federalagents and county sheriffs.   Lundgren's 38-year-old wife, Alice, and the couple's 19-year-oldson, Damon, also were arrested there. Three other Lundgren children_ Kristen, 10, Caleb, 9, and Jason, 15 _ were taken into protectivecustody, said Andrew Vita, the special agent in charge of theBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office in Los Angeles.   ``This will relieve a lot of apprehension,'' Kirtland, Ohio,police officer Ronald K. Andolsek said late Sunday on theLundgrens' arrests. In recent days, Kirtland police had beenkeeping close watch of the homes of residents who were oncethreatened by Lundgren.   John Hewicker, a San Diego County deputy district attorney whohandles extraditions, said today that the Lundgrens toldinvestigators they would refuse to waive extradition to Ohio, wherethey face charges that include aggravated murder and kidnapping.   The Lundgrens will be in state court on Tuesday for arraignmenton fugitive charges, Hewicker said. The extradition hearing wouldcome later, he said.   Lundgren broke away from the Reorganized Church and persuadedother members to follow him, officials said. The group once livedon a 15-acre farm near the Cleveland-area town, where investigatorslast week unearthed five bodies. Authorities believe the five areDennis Avery, his wife, Cheryl, and their three young daughters.   Investigators believe the Averys were killed in mid-April andburied in a common grave under the barn.   Searches of the Southern California motel room and a nearbystorage area rented by Jeffrey Lundgren uncovered numerous weapons,including an AR-15 assault rifle, as well as ammunition, knives andgas masks, Vita said.   ``They had camping gear, web gear that the military would wear _things that can sustain you up in the mountains,'' he said.   ``We're not sure where they were going,'' ATF agent JamesStathes said.   Authorities had been watching the motel since Saturday night,said George Rodriguez, a special agent for the ATF in Kansas City,Mo.   Lundgren and 12 of his followers were indicted by a Lake County,Ohio, grand jury in the killings. Two followers _ Kathryn ReneeJohnson, 36, of Holden, Mo., and Daniel David Craft, 25, of Nauvoo,Ill. _ remain at large.   Authorities were led to the motel in National City, about fivemiles south of San Diego, by telephone calls made from a pay phoneto another location under surveillance, said Steven C. LaTourette,a Lake County prosecutor who held a news conference in Painesville,Ohio.   ``This case continues to develop. As a prosecutor, I've got totell you, it's a great case,'' LaTourette said.   The prosecutor has said the Averys apparently were killed in acult sacrifice necessary under a prophecy of Lundgren's before thecult could relocate.   However, the president of the northeast Ohio chapter of theReorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, DaleLuffman, said he thought the slayings resulted from a dispute overmoney, sex or fear the family would leave the cult.   The church stripped Lundgren of his lay minister credentials in1987 after he began preaching radical doctrines.   Though the church has roots and some beliefs in common with theMormon Church, the two churches are separate.</TEXT></DOC>
