Johnson, senior vice president and chief financial officer at Consolidated Natural Gas Co., Pittsburgh. The U.S. &quot;has the same huge budget and trade deficits and the same problem of a potentially weaker dollar. Can rates come down some more? Perhaps. But the chances are much greater they'll go up, up, up,&quot; Mr. Johnson says, echoing the thoughts of many corporate executives.    After last Monday's record 508.00-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, yields on some 30-year U.S. government securities tumbled more than a percentage point to 9.1%, the biggest drop ever for a five-day period, according to Ryan Financial Strategy Group. Rates on six-month Treasury bills also plummeted about 1.2 percentage points as worried investors sought refuge in the safest securities.    An investor who bought a benchmark 30-year Treasury bond Oct. 16 and sold it late Friday afternoon would have had a profit of $118.10 on a $1,000 investment. &quot;That's a record weekly return,&quot; says Ronald Ryan, managing director of the data service bearing his name.    As credit-easing by the Federal Reserve and fears of a recession helped fuel the bond market rally, more than two dozen companies rushed to issue about $4.7 billion of new debt securities. But while lots of economists now predict even lower rates as a result of the stock market debacle, many corporate financial executives remain unconvinced.    &quot;If the economy is going into a recession, none of us should have borrowed&quot; last week, says Richard J. Clout, a vice president in charge of borrowing at General Motors Acceptance Corp. &quot;From a financing standpoint,&quot; GMAC's $250 million bond issue Friday &quot;was a great opportunity,&quot; he adds. &quot;The economy is strong and the psychology that caused rates to rise this year could occur again.&quot;    Federated Department Stores Inc. issued $200 million of five-year notes last Thursday. &quot;We don't think bond yields will fall much further,&quot; says a spokesman for the Cincinnati-based retailer. Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania's $125 million offering of debentures, issued the same day, also was timed &quot;to get the best rates, and we feel we did,&quot; says a spokesman for the Philadelphia-based company.    &quot;Unless there's another 500-point drop in the stock market, I think yields&quot; on long-term Treasury bonds &quot;will have a hard time dropping much below 9%,&quot; says Nathan Hasson, executive vice president and treasurer at Republic National Bank of New York. &quot;The budget and trade deficits are still there and a big problem,&quot; he says.    In addition, Mr. Hasson contends that &quot;all the liquidity the Fed is injecting into the financial system, as it successfully averts a financial crisis, could lead to more inflation&quot; next year. &quot;I've never seen a recession begin here when the economy was growing and rates were falling sharply,&quot; he adds.    Despite the stock market crash, recent government statistics show healthy growth for the U.S. economy, which advanced 3.8% in the third quarter from 2.5% in the second quarter as measured by the inflation-adjusted gross national product.    When the stock market plummeted and the bond market rallied last week, &quot;I suddenly realized we had a great window of opportunity to borrow,&quot; says Mr. Johnson of Consolidated Natural Gas. &quot;It took me only 90 seconds to consult with five&quot; potential underwriters &quot;and my financial policy committee&quot; before launching a $100 million offering of five-year debentures last Thursday.    &quot;I'm so glad I have my hundred million dollars,&quot; says Mr. Johnson. &quot;If the dollar starts falling again, interest rates will go right back up.&quot;    For some financial officers, the contrast between the stock market's record plunge and a relatively buoyant economy is contributing to their skepticism about an imminent recession. &quot;While our stock price has gone from the mid-50s to low-40s in one week, our fundamental business hasn't changed and energy prices are firm,&quot; says Robert T. Blakely, senior vice president and chief financial officer at Houston-based Tenneco Inc.    Mr. Blakely says he &quot;struggles with the growing prediction by economists that we're going to get a recession in 1988. I think this economy will be a lot stronger than people think.&quot; In the meantime, &quot;I think yields&quot; on long-term Treasury bonds &quot;will climb back toward 10%,&quot; he adds, noting that &quot;rates may start creeping up later this year or in early 1988.&quot;    Like many chief financial officers, Mr. Blakely remains worried about the U.S. position as the world's biggest debtor nation. &quot;Nothing has changed,&quot; he says. &quot;The deficits and the importance of foreign capital to finance the deficits are going to contribute to higher rates unless something is done soon&quot; by the president and Congress.    A growing number of economists, however, say the shock of the stock market crash will drive short-term and long-term interest rates as much as a percentage point lower in the weeks ahead. For instance, Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., contends that yields on 30-year government bonds could drop as low as 8%. Only a week ago, when the yield on the benchmark long-term issue was at 10.19%, Mr. Kaufman said higher rates were inevitable.    Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh, largely agrees. &quot;I would lay 50-50 odds on a recession next year and expect lower rates in the wake of the stock market crash,&quot; he says. Nevertheless, Mr. Robertson says economists &quot;don't have any experience to draw on to determine the impact on the economy&quot; of last week's stock market.    &quot;The economy is performing extremely well and is better balanced than it's been in years,&quot; says Mr. Robertson. &quot;If the Fed is pumping money into the banking system now as a result of the stock market decline, it is taking a calculated risk that more money (won't) show up in the form of higher rates and higher inflation next year.&quot;    Whatever the case, &quot;We're likely to see many sudden financing windows in the weeks ahead as the markets remain highly volatile,&quot; says Lindley Richert, a senior vice president and chief market analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei Inc. Despite the huge bond market rally, highly rated corporations paid as much as 0.4 percentage point more over comparable Treasury yields than they did last February.    &quot;We haven't seen such a widening of spreads between Treasurys and new corporate offerings since the spring of 1986,&quot; says Mr. Richert, who is also the author of McCarthy Crisanti Maffei's &quot;CorporateWatch&quot; service. &quot;But as long the market's volatility continues, these spreads may remain.&quot;    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   Prices of actively traded 30-year bonds fell an eighth of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount, in highly volatile trading. Early in the day, the benchmark issue traded as high as 100, its highest price since it was auctioned last August.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 6.80 points to 1234.43. It ranged between 1231.02 and 1259.21.    Among actively traded issues, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell to a price of 97 5/8 from 97 3/4 Thursday, as the yield rose to 9.11% from 9.09%. The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 fell to a price of 97 3/4 from 98, as the yield rose to 8.97% from 8.93%.    Rates on three-month and six-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 5.3% bid and 6% bid, respectively. The rate on federal funds, or reserves banks lend each other overnight, averaged 7%, down from 7.14%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). </TEXT></DOC>
