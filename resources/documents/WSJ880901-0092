Why not take a vacation trip abroad?    That's what Sanford C. Sigoloff, chairman of Wickes Cos., is doing. And the executive, known as &quot;Ming the Merciless&quot; for his tough managerial approach, is said to be traveling in comfort.    Earlier this week, Mr. Sigoloff, accompanied by his wife, Betty, and another couple left for a long-planned two-week trip to the Soviet Union and some other stops in Europe. One friend of the travelers says they have hired two chauffeur-driven limousines to drive between Moscow and Leningrad; the two couples could fit into one car, the friend says, but there was no room for all their luggage.    The friend adds: &quot;They say they're just going to visit -- unless Sandy's really going to be asking Gorbachev for help&quot; with the tender offer.    That's doubtful, since Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has already expressed confidence that it can raise the money to help Mr. Sigoloff take Wickes private. But Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. has a mandate from a committee of Wickes's outside directors to beat the drums for a higher bidder and says it has been getting lots of calls. Suppose a new bidder emerges and wants to do a quick deal while the touring chairman is, say, visiting the Winter Palace?    &quot;Sandy calls in daily,&quot; says a Wickes spokesman. &quot;They do have phones in Russia.&quot;    He's Done Some Time,   Now Wants to Talk   LIVING BEHIND bars has changed Michael H. Clott: It has made him loquacious.    The 35-year-old Mr. Clott is the former chairman of Baltimore-based First American Mortgage Co., which collapsed in 1985. He remained silent last year as a federal grand jury indicted him on charges that he used the company to &quot;personally enrich himself.&quot;    His silence continued at his trial, where evidence showed that he siphoned First American's assets, drawing an annual salary of $520,000 and treating himself to expensive homes and cars.    In July 1987, Mr. Clott pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering and mail fraud. He was sentenced in December to 12 1/2 years in prison and ordered to write letters of apology to his victims.    Now that he has done some time in federal prison in Tallahassee, Fla., Mr. Clott has new thoughts. He called a reporter the other day to say, &quot;I'm ready to make a statement. I think I was a victim of selective prosecution.&quot;    Other parties were implicated in the investigation, he says, but the prosecutors didn't try to pursue them. &quot;I'm kind of sorry I pled guilty,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn't think I would go to jail.&quot;    Why didn't he speak up earlier? &quot;My lawyers wouldn't let me,&quot; he says. &quot;They said I shouldn't air my case in the press because the court hates that. And on the stand, they made me take the Fifth.&quot;    Told of Mr. Clott's feelings, one of his two attorneys, Andrew J. Graham, declines comment and says the other attorney is on vacation but wouldn't want to comment either.    'Can You Top This?'    'Why, Sure I Can'   TO THOSE who have been wondering how Gerald Tsai Jr., Primerica Corp.'s chairman, and Sanford I. Weill, chairman of Commercial Credit Group Inc., will get along after the two companies' planned merger takes place, both men have said: No problem.    Mr. Tsai explains that his 39 years in business have taught him that &quot;a violin can't be played by two people.&quot; Thus, he says, as the largest shareholder of the new company, he will be perfectly content to concentrate on planning and strategy while Mr. Weill serves as chairman, president and chief executive.    Still, Mr. Tsai isn't above seizing the fiddle for a one-upmanship tune. On the day that Messrs. Tsai and Weill were celebrating Commercial Credit's agreement to acquire Primerica, Mr. Tsai listened as Mr. Weill boasted about the birth of his first grandchild. Said Mr. Tsai: &quot;I already have three grandchildren.&quot;    Rumor-Mill Grist:   A Bushel of Apples   IT WAS a sure thing that Chicago's Leo Burnett Co. was acquiring Toronto's Vickers andamp; Benson Cos. Everybody said so -- except the top officials of both advertising agencies.    Keep in mind that Canada's advertising community has been rife with gossip about acquisitions of Canadian agencies by foreign concerns. Still, on the recent day when the hot Burnett-Vickers rumor was racing around Toronto, it came as a shock to Burnett's Canadian contingent. &quot;I heard the rumor but had no idea how it started,&quot; says an official of Burnett's Toronto office.    Terry O'Malley, Vickers andamp; Benson's president, also heard the rumor but soon figured out how it began. Vickers andamp; Benson, he explains, had a contract to provide some publicity posters for Ontario's apple commission. When the photo shoot was completed, he says, the art director brought the apples back to Vickers andamp; Benson's offices &quot;rather than let them stay in somebody's studio and go to waste.&quot; Soon, apples began popping up on desks all over Vickers andamp; Benson's Toronto office.    As it happens, the Leo Burnett agency uses apples as a sign of hospitality, keeping barrels of the fruit in the lobbies of its offices world-wide. So . . . &quot;By the time the apples got distributed, somebody figured we were preparing an announcement,&quot; says Mr. O'Malley.    But somebody figured wrong. Mr. O'Malley says his agency had preliminary talks with Burnett more than a year ago but they never led anywhere. </TEXT></DOC>
