U.S.-backed Moslem guerrilla sources claimed that since theweekend, 1,500 soldiers and 700 armed militiamen defected to theself-proclaimed guerrilla government based in Pakistan. The reportcould not be independently confirmed.   One Western diplomat, speaking in Islamabad on condition he notbe identified, said high-altitude cluster bombs rained down inrecent days on villages and guerrilla positions along the LogarRoad, which links the capital Kabul to Gardez, 100 miles southeast.   There were no immediate casualty reports.   Diplomats said guerrillas have stopped a 200-vehicle supplyconvoy on the Logar Road at Mohammad Aga, 18 miles southeast ofKabul. The government convoy stuck at Mohammad Aga reportedly leftthe capital about two weeks ago and is headed toward the embattledgarrison town of Khost, near the Pakistan border.   Guerrillas launched an offensive against Khost more than twomonths ago but fighting is deadlocked.   A guerrilla source, known only as Amanullah, corroboratedreports of heavy bombing along the Logar road but said about 60percent of the villages were already reduced to rubble in bombingraids during the early years of the war.   Most civilians from the area moved to neighboring Pakistan,where more than 3 million refugees have fled from the decade-longbattle between Soviet-backed communist troops and the Mosleminsurgents.   Diplomats, quoting guerrilla sources, said guerrilla fightershit a government convoy traveling on the strategic Salang Highway,linking Kabul to the Soviet Union.   Guerrillas claimed to have destroyed more than 20 vehicles andcaptured 30 others, including tanks and armored personnel carriers,in last week's attack.   Diplomats and rebel sources said the road between Kabul and theeastern city of Jalalabad has been blocked by guerrilla fighterssince Sept. 25. The 75-mile stretch of highway is critical for thegovernment to resupply the beseiged city of Jalalabad.   A guerrilla spokesman, who uses the single name Iqbal, said1,500 army troops deserted their positions in eastern Afghanistan'sGhazni province on Monday.   The 700 militiamen defected on the weekend from 20 outposts innorthern Samangan province, guerrilla sources said. The defectionweakened a security ring around the northern town of Robatak, theysaid.</TEXT></DOC>
