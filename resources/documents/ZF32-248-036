 12, 1991).andM;The event's format is a first for CIPS.andP;  Telesat Canada has been contractedto produce the event under CIPS' direction.andP;  The telecast will involveestablishing a live satellite link-up, with one-way video and two-way audio,between the originating location and designated sites in each city served bya CIPS section (there are currently 20 CIPS sections operating in citiesacross Canada).andM;Maximizing the capacities of the delivery technology, the CIPS NationalTelecast Symposium will provide a half-day seminar of topical interest toinformation technology professionals, with built-in question and answersessions for participation by all attendees.andP;  Symposium attendees fromVictoria to Halifax will hear input from other attendees, and will have anopportunity for live, real-time interaction with the symposium speakers nomatter where they're located.andM;&quot;The methodology behind this event is a major breakthrough for CIPS,&quot; statesStephen Ralphs, chairman of the Symposium organizing committee.andP;  &quot;In pastyears, CIPS sponsored a national seminar, a cross-country road show whichstopped only in major population centres.andP;  Now for the first time, all CIPSsections can participate simultaneously in a truly national education event.andM;&quot;The event is coming to them,&quot; he added.andM;The symposium's title is &quot;The Enterprise Computing Paradigm: Networking theOrganization and Its Business Partners.&quot;andP;  What factors will determine theenterprise computing model of the '90s and beyond?andP;  In this timely andthought-provoking symposium, two distinguished presenters will suggest thatnetworking, in its potential both for facilitating communications within anorganization and also for linking it to its customers and suppliers, willplay a key role.andM;The unique presentation format has been designed for attendee participation.andO;Michael Treacy will begin the day by discussing &quot;Cross-Functional Systems forthe 1990s.&quot;andP;  Then, following an interactive question and answer session withthe Symposium audience across Canada, Jim Herman will comment on Treacy'spresentation, giving another perspective.andM;Subsequently, Herman will make his major presentation, entitled &quot;Managing theNetwork Computing Utility,&quot; followed by more audience question-and-answer.andO;Treacy will then comment on the presentation.andP;  Thanks to the effectiveness oflive video communications and satellite technology, all symposium attendeeswill see the presentations as well as the speakers' slides.andM;Treacy played a role in CIPS' last Management Forum, where he was one of thetop-rated speakers of the event.andP;  He is a renowned lecturer, researcher andconsultant on the management of information technology and its impact oncorporate strategy and performance.andM;Herman is a leading expert on communications network technology and itsmanagement.andP;  His current interests include effective use oftelecommunications as a strategic business asset, and integrated voice/datanetwork design and management.andP;  Recent assignments have involvedcommunications strategy, planning and architecture for wide- and local-areanetworks.andM;The event will take place on Feb. 12 in the communities of each CIPS sectionacross Canada at a local hotel, conference centre or theatre.andP;  Local on-sitecoordinators will ensure that questions for the speakers will be availablefrom each location.andP;  The Symposium itself will last four-and-a-half hours;some sections will be planning a day-long event around the seminar.andM;Since the event is live and simultaneous, it will begin at different times ineach time zone, starting at 9 a.m.andP;  on the West Coast and 1 p.m.andP;  in AtlanticCanada.andP;  The telecast broadcast will emanate from Toronto.andP;  Each site willprovide a light refreshment, and a detailed symposium program will beprovided to each attendee.andM;A number of Canadian corporations will be involved in the symposium as eventsponsors.andP;  Those firms participating at press time are NCR Canada, TelecomCanada, Industry, Science and Technology Canada, the Ontario Ministry ofIndustry, Trade and Technology, and Digital Equipment of Canada Ltd.andM;The event will be of interest to IT directors and managers, communicationsand network managers, professionals working in enterprise-wide applicationsdesign and development, and network design and implementation, WAN or LANarchitecture, as well as educators.andM;Anyone wishing to attend the symposium or to learn more about the event, maycontact the CIPS National Office in Toronto at (416) 593-4040.andM;Anne McKague is publicity director for the National Telecast SymposiumCommittee and president of McKague and Associates, a Toronto-basedcommunications and marketing consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
