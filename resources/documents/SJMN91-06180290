How many people want to watch matches that were over in time for thenoon news?;    &quot;I'm not necessarily persuaded that all of the people know allof the results,&quot; said Greenway, who also rejected the idea that there's a WestCoast audience for live coverage at 6 a.m.;    If HBO were closer in format toall-sports ESPN, I'd have more of a problem with Greenway's arguments. Butpeople subscribing to HBO probably aren't doing it because of the intermittentsports programming, and that makes it hard to argue for early morning or evenafternoon coverage.; EXPANSION MISTAKE? I know a baseball fan in the TVbusiness who did some interesting ratings research recently and now asks thequestion, &quot;Did baseball expand to the wrong cities?&quot;;    This source, whoasked not to be identified, compared the ratings for CBS baseball telecasts inthe Miami and Denver markets with ratings from a market that stood out becauseit has been delivering better than average ratings -- the Tampa-St. Petersburgarea. Miami and Denver were picked by the National League's expansioncommittee; Tampa-St. Petersburg was rejected.;    Here's some of what theresearch showed:;    (check) On April 27, CBS's baseball coverage earned a 3.7national rating. Miami came in at 2.5, Denver at 2.9 and Tampa-St. Petersburgat 4.5.;    (check) On May 5, the national rating was 3.1. Miami registered a1.5, Denver a 1.2 and Tampa-St. Petersburg a 3.5.;    (check) On May 25, thenational number was 4.0. Miami had a 2.1, Denver a 2.4 and Tampa-St.Petersburg a 3.8.;    (check) On June 15 -- the Saturday following theannouncement in favor of Miami and Denver -- the national rating was 3.3.Miami earned a 2.5, Denver a 2.4 and Tampa-St. Petersburg a 5.9.;    Ratingsare percentages of all the TV-equipped homes in a market that tuned in to atelecast.;    Are they indicators of how a city will support a franchise?Probably not. But maybe this is the more important factor: How much damagewill those ratings in Miami and Denver do to baseball's bargaining positionwhen it's time to negotiate new TV deals?; AROUND THE DIAL: NBC has negotiateda three-year deal to televise professional beach volleyball. The networkbasically is becoming one of the tour's partners -- there is no rights fee andNBC shares revenues -- and even will cover some events live. . . . BeginningThursday, KICU (Ch. 36) will begin a weekly series of reports called &quot;SharkSchool&quot; as part of its 10 p.m. newscasts. The concept is to introduce viewersto the rules of hockey as well as to the Sharks' personnel.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mike Antonucci column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910628  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  582  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 28, 199100180290,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
