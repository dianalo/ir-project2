Bush, denying that investigations of Attorney General EdwinMeese III are hurting his campaign, also warned that if theDemocrats ``want to go down the low road, we'll meet them.''   In another development, The Washington Post reported in itsSunday editions that testimony and documents from a private lawsuitportray top aides to Bush as being more actively involved inCentral American counterinsurgency planning from 1983 to 1986 thanpreviously disclosed.   The information, however, does not contradict assertions bysenior advisers Donald P. Gregg and Col. Samuel J. Watson III thatthey were unaware until August 1986 of the plan to resupply theNicaraguan rebels during a ban on U.S. aid, the newspaper said.   According to the information, Bush was advised on June 3, 1986of the Salvadoran Air Force's need for spare parts for itshelicopters. The memo stressed the need to quickly solve theproblem to help Salvordan President Jose Napolean Duarte win thewar. Bush wrote ``Good!'' on the memo.   Gregg and Watson provided the memos and testimony last weekduring pretrial questioning of witnesses in a $24 million civilsuit filed by two journalists against 29 people, many of whomfigure in the Iran-Contra investigation.   Bush, at a rally in the sunny atrium of a Cleveland StateUniversity building, called for all Americans to ``stand up againstdrug use, even casual use, (and) express our outrage when we seesome in the entertainment industry condoning, almost advocatingcocaine as some kind of a modern hip lifestyle.''   In an interview with Cleveland reporters, Bush said he wasshocked at the approving way cocaine was presented in a video heand his wife, Barbara, rented. He did not name the film.   He told the crowd of 300, ``There's much more to do in thisfight.''   ``We've appointed tougher judges. We are getting more convictionand longer sentences. But where are the Democrats on mandatorysentencing, on tougher penalties for those who poison our kids withdrugs? I favor the death penalty for drug kingpins, those involvedin drug-related killings,'' he said.   ``If Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson are serious about this,let's see where they stand on throwing the book at those who arepoisoning the lives of the young people.''   Both Dukakis and Jackson oppose capital punishment for any crime.   Bush said, ``What about those ... who get minors to do theirdirty work, their drug-dealing for them? Throw the book at them.Put 'em where the sun don't shine.''   Dr. Otis Bowen, the secretary of health and human services,voiced pessimism this week about the war on drugs and told Reaganat a White House meeting that the Democrats ``are poised to stealfrom our party what has been a traditionally Republican issue: lawenforcement.''   Aboard Air Force Two, Robert Teeter, Bush's polling expert andstrategist, said drugs have become an increasingly important issuein voters' minds in the past six months.   Voters ``want answers, they want results. They ... don't want toblame somebody, they want a solution,'' said Teeter.   Bush also visited a nursing home in Columbus, St. Raphael's Homefor the Aged, on what was once the estate of his industrialistgrandfather, the late Samuel Bush.   There Bush told the Carmelite nuns and elderly residents, ``Ipledge to you that in a Bush administration, there will belong-term care legislation put on the books.''   Bush also took in a spring football scrimmage at Ohio State.Before returning to Washington, the vice president rode a riverboat across the Ohio River from West Virginia to Marietta, Ohio, tomark the bicentennial of that one-time frontier town.   Some unemployed steel workers from Waterford, Ohio, carriedprotest signs and groaned when Bush spoke about the 64-montheconomic recovery. But most of the crowd of 5,000 at the water'sedge cheered the Republican candidate.   ``Look, some people in your state are hurting, and so are theyin mine,'' Bush said. ``But we have created 15{ million new jobssince 1982. ... That is progress and we must keep it going untileverybody benefits.''   The vice president told Cleveland reporters he has evidence tothrow the ``sleaze'' allegations back in the Democrats' faces, butdeclined to be specific.   He said he is ``keeping my powder dry. ... I want to see thewhites of their eyes.''   ``I've heard Dukakis and Jackson talk about sleaze. What arethey talking about? Who are they talking about?'' said Bush. ``Arethey convicting someone before the system works?''   Bush has already clinched the GOP nomination, but Ohio _ whichholds its primary Tuesday along with Indiana and the District ofColumbia _ will be a key battleground in the fall.</TEXT></DOC>
