Western's $3.5 billion in deposits, 61 branches andcertain assets were acquired last week by BankAmerica Corp.for $81 million. Western reported negative shareholder equityof $1.4 billion at year end, but on Friday the ResolutionTrust Corp. said the total cost of the collapse, includingpaying off insured depositors and creditors, selling troubledassets and resolving lawsuits, would approximate $1.7billion.</LP><TEXT>   Only Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association, Irvine, Calif.,and Miami-based CenTrust Bank are expected to cost more, atleast $2 billion each. Those cases haven't been finallyresolved.   The estimate for Western points up the depth of theArizona thrift problem, and its role in the overall bailout.The state's boom-turned-bust real-estate business of the lastfew years has claimed nearly every major thrift in the statefor government regulators. According to Miami thriftconsultant Kenneth Thomas, some 82% of the deposits of thestate's thrifts were in government hands at year-end 1989 byvirtue of seizures, far exceeding the rate in any otherstate, including Texas, where a number of private rescueswere arranged a few years ago.   The Western sale to San Francisco-based BankAmerica, Mr.Thomas said, &quot;signals the start of the denationalization ofthe thrift industry in Arizona.&quot;   Western had one of the largest portfolios of repossessedreal estate of any thrift in the country, an estimated $637million at year end, and an additional $295 million in whatare considered highly speculative loans for land developmentand acquisition, according to Mr. Thomas. Before it was takenover by federal regulators last June, Western also held some$46 million in junk bonds.   Western also took advantage of an Arizona state law thatpermitted thrifts to own stock in other companies, althoughthat didn't turn out too well, either, according to AllanBortel, an investment banker specializing in thrifts forSutro andamp; Co. in San Francisco. Among its ill-starred equityventures was an investment in a Washington state campgroundoperator, according to Mr. Bortel.   Meanwhile, a new study published by the Stanford Law andPolicy Review suggested that even sharply higher governmentestimates made recently for bailing out the industry are fartoo low. The journal, published by Stanford University, citeda computerized financial model of the thrift debacle's totalcosts, compiled by Sheshunoff Information Services Inc.,Austin, Texas. The model includes costs often excluded byadministration officials, such as lost tax revenue andinterest on Treasury debt. It puts the cost of the bailout atroughly $456 billion over 10 years, compared with a GeneralAccounting Office estimate of $325 billion to $500 billionover 30 years. The Sheshunoff study asserted that total costswill certainly exceed $1 trillion, including the interest dueon long-term Treasury bonds financing the bailout.   On Friday, when asked at a conference in Washington, D.C.,how the government was proceeding in its effort to unload itshuge inventory of troubled institutions, Federal DepositInsurance Corp. Chairman William Seidman said: &quot;Better thanyou think and worse than you would like.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
