(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Dennis EskowandM;Executives talk a lot about mixing business goals and information systems(IS) goals, but at Du Pont Canada Inc. they did something about it.andM;It started when the Toronto-based plastics unit wanted a computer system thatwould provide detailed information about how its products were selling inCanada and globally.andM;Much of the sales monitoring was being done manually.andP;  &quot;They sensed that theywere being buried in paper and that automation was the answer.andP;  But theydidn't know how to bring it off,&quot; said Craig Leetch, manager of Du PontCanada's business decision support systems (DSS) department.andM;Today the new DSS lets users discover with a few keystrokes such salesinformation as whether a product is making more money in one region thananother.andP;  And the system was developed in record time, headed by businessanalyst Leetch, rather than by a computer professional.andM;The road to the new system was rocky, however.andP;  Leetch initially went to theIS department looking for help, but IS couldn't come up with a solution.andP;  &quot;Westumbled around for a few months in 1988, and I realized the answer was goingto come from outside,&quot; he said.andM;Leetch wanted to work with an organization that would allow him to maintainclose control of the project and that could turn around the project quickly.andO;He contacted a number of consultants and resellers before finally settling onan outfit within Du Pont.andM;The newly formed Du Pont Information Engineering Associates (IEA) inWilmington, Del., had already solved similar business problems and wasworking on quick-turnaround projects.andM;Mike Costello, director of marketing for Du Pont IEA, said his group had aproprietary technology -- Rapid Iterative Production Prototyping (RIPP) thatwould allow the business manager to see how the program looked right on acomputer screen.andM;&quot;The whole world is trying to provide enabling tools for the end user todevelop applications for himself,&quot; said Costello.andP;  &quot;RIPP and most rapidprototyping tools are the missing link in that area.&quot;andM;With the RIPP method, Du Pont IEA worked with Leetch on the cost, scope,timing, staffing and objectives of the plastics division project.andM;&quot;They went beyond the systems questions and got into the business basics,&quot;said Leetch.andP;  For each project, starting with the plastics market assessmentproject, Du Pont IEA appointed a departmental &quot;champion,&quot; a staff member whowould learn the RIPP methodology.andP;  &quot;The object is to walk away from the enduser knowing he or she can lead an application-development team in thefuture,&quot; he added.andM;Scott Schultz, general manager for Du Pont IEA, said, &quot;Market studies haveshown that 75 percent of all software projects undertaken by Americanbusinesses are never installed, either because they are never completed orbecause they arrive too late.&quot; At Du Pont Canada, the number of unusedsoftware programs is about 100 percent, Schultz said.andM;RIPP didn't turn out to be an immediate application for Du Pont Canada, butit helped the company focus on a target technology to answer its businessproblem -- rapid prototyping.andP;  Du Pont accomplished the goal, Leetch said, bydeveloping a model system that was dubbed Plastics Information ExecutiveReporting System.andM;The system provides windows of information that let executives watch severalmarket dynamics at one time.andP;  Items in the windows can be mixed and matchedin the corporate database to provide a variety of business metrics notavailable before.andM;Once the model was approved by management, all that was left was to find theproduct that would do the job, said Leetch.andM;The system of choice was Comshare Inc.'s Commander EIS (Executive InformationSystem), an executive information toolbox that includes natural languageprogramming and LAN capabilities.andM;&quot;We're running the system on a mainframe,&quot; said Leetch, &quot;but we are staffingup now to run it on LANs.andP;  By the end of 1991 we will have 13 LANs, eachrunning its own decision support applications for different businessmanagers.andP;  It's an entirely new way to manage a business.&quot;andM;Leetch said his biggest problem since fixing the plastics unit's needs hasbeen political: Who goes on the LAN first?andM;&quot;We are developing green applications that can be turned around so quickly,they should have an impact on the business within a year,&quot; said Leetch.andM;The applications include the central EIS that is being used by Du Pont CanadaCEO Ted Newall,divisional executives and the offshoot decision supportsystems including a manufacturing plant production-analysis andretail-pricing system.andM;&quot;Perhaps most important is the fact that executives see decision support as areal business tool,&quot; said Leetch.andP;  &quot;I expect that business solutions in thefuture will have much more apparent solutions thanks to the changes in ourthinking.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
