The company had fiscal first-quarter net income of $67.5 million, or 99 cents a share, after a one-time gain of $28.7 million, compared with a loss of $192.6 million in the year-ago quarter, when the company was hit by a costly strike. The one-time gain resulted from new accounting rules for income taxes. Sales for the quarter ended Jan. 31 more than doubled to $1 billion, from $478 million a year ago.    Analysts said the results were better than expected. The first quarter is typically the slowest for the industry. The results are a sign of what the company can do when volume starts to increase, said John McGinty, an analyst with First Boston Corp.    But Deere is still moving cautiously. The company said it expects higher retail sales for fiscal 1988, and a 25% increase in production over 1987. However most of the production increase is planned for the second quarter, with moderate increases scheduled for the last two quarters. A spokesman for the company said the gradual increases will allow for closer monitoring of the market. He noted that in the past, high inventories were a problem for the industry.    Despite the lower U.S. dollar that is boosting exports for many U.S. manufacturers, Deere said the bulk of its sales growth came domestically. However, that domestic growth is in part the result of higher exports by U.S. farmers, who are buying Deere equipment.    Deere said North American sales rose sharply to $827 million, from $339 million in the year earlier, while overseas sales rose 57% to $218 million.    The company said it is basing its outlook on continued improvements in the farm economy. These improvements range from record farm net in 1987 to stabilizing land prices and an aging fleet of farm equipment. The shrinking price differences between used and new equipment also is helping. &quot;More farmers are deciding, especially in the environment of higher-priced used equipment, to opt for new,&quot; the spokesman said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Deere closed yesterday at $41.625 a share, up 87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
