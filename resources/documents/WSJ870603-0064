Levine repeatedly frustrated a bipartisan effort by lawmakers to delve into the investment banking industry's reliance on insider information.    Mr. Levine, who testified at a closed hearing yesterday before the House Commerce Committee's oversight subcommittee, on several points contradicted what he had earlier told panel staff members, according to Rep. Ronald Wyden (D., Ore.) and other subcommittee sources.    The most glaring discrepancy involved the number of times that Mr. Levine said he tapped his network of contacts and alerted his superiors to impending corporate takeover bids, subcommittee sources said.    When he was debriefed last April at the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa., Mr. Levine told subcommittee staffers that on 20 occasions during his Wall Street career he gave information about imminent takeovers to his superiors, who would use it to line up clients, according to subcommittee sources. But yesterday, they said, Mr. Levine could recall only five such occasions.    &quot;Why didn't Dennis Levine's superiors question the sources of his 'uncanny' information on possible corporate takeovers?&quot; asked Rep. Norman Lent (R., N.Y.).    &quot;You get the feeling that his supervisors would say, 'Gee whiz,' and wink and nod,&quot; Mr. Wyden said. &quot;The supervisor would say, 'How good is it (the information)?' And Dennis would say, 'Good enough to make the call'&quot; to the target company to propose a takeover defense.    &quot;At best, they were asleep at the switch,&quot; Mr. Wyden said of Mr. Levine's supervisors. &quot;At worst, you have here a policy of nonresponsibility.&quot;    From 1979 until last year, Mr. Levine worked in the mergers-and-acquisitions departments of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.; Lehman Bros. Kuhn Loeb Inc., the predecessor of Shearson Lehman Brothers, and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    Mr. Levine, who made $12.6 million by trading on inside information, is serving a two-year sentence. He pleaded guilty to four felony counts a year ago under a plea-bargain agreement. His cooperation with the government's investigation of insider trading on Wall Street led to the downfall of arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky.    The former investment banker appeared thinner than before his imprisonment and was sun-tanned from mowing lawns on the Lewisburg grounds, congressional sources said. He wore a charcoal-gray suit, white shirt and a burgundy-striped tie. &quot;He looked like he walked out of a board room, instead of a prison,&quot; a staff member said.    Mr. Levine's testimony was closed to the public at the insistence of his attorney, Martin Flumenbaum, a partner in the New York firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison. Subcommittee staffers said Mr. Flumebaum feared that Mr. Levine's public comments might be used against him in civil suits. But the panel can vote to release transcripts of his testimony.    Subcommittee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) said that it is unlikely that the transcripts will be released. He said other defendants in the insider trading scandal may be subpoenaed to testify. &quot;Boesky would probably fall at the top of that list,&quot; he said.    At the hearing, Rep. Lent, the Commerce Committee's ranking Republican, and other lawmakers expressed dismay at the $1.5 million bonus Mr. Levine collected from Drexel Burnham -- and doubt that he earned it for being a shrewd market analyst.    Contradictions between Mr. Levine's sworn testimony and his previous statements to subcommittee staffers vexed some lawmakers. When interviewed in prison, Mr. Levine indicated that one of his supervisors may have personally traded on takeover information that he gleaned from his Wall Street sources, according to congressional sources. Yesterday, however, Mr. Levine couldn't recall suggesting that the subcommittee look into any supervisor's trading.    Mr. Levine also told subcommittee staffers that he would have continued trading on inside information and would have put about $40 million in a secret offshore bank account, but for the mistakes of others and the perseverance of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But yesterday, according to congressional sources, he couldn't remember saying he would have amassed that much money.    Mr. Wyden said that the subcommittee intends to investigate the Levine case further, including discrepancies in his story. </TEXT></DOC>
