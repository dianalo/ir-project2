 This year, in addition to new developments on theshow floor, there has been the announcement of a joint venture between SystemIntegrators and Digital Technology, which may put its indelible mark on thesystems business.andP;  That venture will undoubtedly be one of the major topicsof discussion at the show, where both SII and DTI will demonstrate theircurrent products, some of which relate closely to the deal.andM;We've covered the SII--DTI plans in a feature article earlier in this issue,including a separate discussion on the state of the newspaper market.andP;  Inthis part of our annual ANPA show preview, we will highlight the developmentswe anticipate in the exhibits.andM;There will be plenty of interesting new products at the show: output devices,systems for creating display ads, editorial and classified systems, scanners,and even new companies, including one run by one of the industry's old folks,Jim Lennane.andM;HighlightsandM;We won't try to mention all of the new items in this introduction to our showpreview, but we will highlight some that we think will be of interest to mostreaders:andM;* PelBox 3000.andP;  ECRM will unveil a new PelBox, designed to produce the bestquality of any of its imaging engines.andP;  Called the 3000, it provides highresolution (3,048 dpi) and improved accuracy that should make it viable formany color applications.andM;* Express S3.andP;  Monotype has a new, faster RIP for its Express imagesetter.andO;The S3 model is claimed to run at a speed of 30 inches per minute.andM;* Front-Page 80C.andP;  Bidco has an improved film transport for its Front-Pagerecorder, so it now claims the machine is suitable for outputting colorseparations.andM;* PostScript for Tegra and Camex.andP;  Both Varityper/Tegra and Camex willdemonstrate non-Adobe PostScript capabilities for their existingimagesetters--the Tegra line from Varityper and the SuperSetter from Camex.andM;* Camex looks to Mac.andP;  Camex also will unveil a Macintosh-based system for addesign, offering a subset of its Breeze capabilities at a lower price.andM;* CompuText broadens base.andP;  The company that showed up last year with acomprehensive classified package is back this year with a new offering forcreating display ads.andP;  CompuText's CAT runs on a Macintosh and introducessome interesting ideas about the user interface.andM;* Layout-driven pagination from Digital Technology.andP;  Although its AdSpeedsystem is the focus of the SII deal, Digital Technology has developed alayout-driven pagination program for its own customers.andP;  Called SpeedPlanner,it runs on a Macintosh alongside the interactive program that made its debutlast winter.andM;* Dewar readies a &quot;new image.&quot;andP;  Dewar will unveil a new editorial systembased on the concept that all parts of the system should share a commonenvironment, including electronic mail, messaging, rolodex, and so on.andP;  Theediting program uses XyWrite.andP;  Also new is the classified system, which runsin the common environment.andM;* Editorial &quot;preview&quot; from INS.andP;  Ever since it announced an intention to getinto the full system business, we have awaited news of the editorial productfrom Integrated Newspaper Systems.andP;  The time has come for a preview of thesystem.andM;* DS to show prototype for low end.andP;  Calling it a &quot;crossover&quot; product, colorvendor DS America will demonstrate a prototype of a laser diode-basedinput/output system that will cost considerably less than its existing line.andM;* Surprises from Scitex?andP;  In Paris two weeks ago, Scitex unveiled a newversion of its Imager III workstation, which is one of a couple of newproducts the company hopes to bring to New Orleans.andM;* Other new items.andP;  Some of the other new items that should be mentionedinclude an ad dummying system in the Mycro-Tek booth, a set of Ad Managercapabilities for Information International's AMS/2, a new scanner from LeafSystems, new versions of the low-end Infosel retrieval system, a new companyfrom Jim Lennane (showing a PostScript RIP of unknown status), and a newlineup from Graph-X, a 1988 exhibitor that previewed some new capabilities atAmerica East.andM;Where to see itandM;Every year in this preview, we try to help visitors by listing where thevarious categories of equipment can be found.andP;  This is never easy.andO;Inevitably some vendors will be left out inadvertently.andP;  Others may beomitted because they didn't indicate soon enough that they would bring aparticular product.andP;  But we still endeavor to provide this list on thepresumption that it helps, even if it isn't quite complete.andP;

 These include:andM;* Dial Up, Then Paste Up--photo-ready complete weather sectionsandM;* color-separated maps with registration marksandM;* custom state and local maps, worldwide forecasts, forecasts for specificactivities and much more.andM;AdobeandM;See Macintosh Newspaper GroupandM;Advanced Technical SolutionsandM;Advanced Technical Solutions (ATS), founded by two former Atex employees, hasdeveloped products for use as extensions to Ates systems.andP;  It also providessupport to Atex customers.andM;Its primary product has been the Workstation II, which is basically an IBM PCequipped with an ATS board and plugged into an Atex system.andP;  It provides thesame functionality as an Atex terminal running editorial, classified,production or system manager applications, with full access to the database.andO;ATS says it has installed nearly 300 of these in the last 16 months.andM;New at ANPA will be the Workstation III, which offers similar features butwhich can be used remotely over phone lines or locally with twisted-paircabling.andP;  ATS will demonstrate the WS III functioning live, interactively,with an Atex system in another city.andM;ATS also will demonstrate Sender Plus, a cooperative project withComputerease.andP;  Using Workstation II, the operator creates files withComputerease's Wordmover editing program on the PC and transfers headerinformation and text to an Atex system.andP;  It is possible to specify the targetqueue and group.andP;  Files are sent in the background.andP;  Multiple files can bequeued without tying up the PC.andM;Finally, ATS will demonstrate its System Wire Input Multiplexer that enablesup to seven wire service lines to be received on a PC, with one portconnected to the host system, which can be any front end.andM;Agence France-PresseandM;Agence France-Presse will show its Impact mainframe eletronic darkroominterfaced with two black-and-white workstations and, for the first time, aMacintosh II color workstation.andP;  A digital wire service feed will rundirectly into the workstations; they will also accept input from a HasselbladDixel scanner.andM;Output will run on both a digital printer (a SepWriter from the Frenchcompany Matra) and an analog printer (a Harris 860).andP;  One Impact terminalwill output directly to a Scitex scanner in the Scitex booth.andM;An Ethernet link will connect an Impact system to a smaller version of thatsame system.andM;On the text side, AFP will have a PC inputting their normal text services,with AFP software for display, indexing, etc.andM;Agfa CompugraphicandM;For the first time in many years, Compugraphic won't demonstrate a front-endnewspaper system.andP;  The Intrepid system that replaced the One Systems linethat had replaced the UTS won't be present, although the Dawn workstation forcreating display ads is very much alive and will be exhibited running on itsnew 80386 CPU.andP;  Dawn will be used to demonstrate some page layout functionsas well as ad make-up.andM;In addition to Dawn, the focus will be on the new family of PostScriptinput/output systems, including the high-resolution CG 9400-PS and the Agfa3400 PS desktop laser printer, both based on Adobe raster image processors,and the Focus S800 GS scanner.andM;Some of the PostScript input will be provided by a Macintosh IIx colorworkstation.andM;AldusandM;See Macintosh Newspaper GroupandM;AmdocsandM;This company made its first ANPA appearance a year ago and also exhibited atIFRA last fall.andP;  At both events it featured its PC software for paginatingYellow Pages directories.andM;This year, Amdocs will introduce a new development effort in the field ofdisplay advertising.andP;  It will show facilities for digitizing, storing andretrieving graphics for use in display ads, but it won't have software foractually making up ads.andM;It also stores stock art, providing the database for accessing relevant artfrom directories and for merging art into files being paginated.andP;  The systemis currently being used in conjunction with a Camex Breeze system, but Amdocssays it will support others also.andM;Demonstrations this year will be expanded to show the entire process, ratherthan just pagination, including selection of artwork, pagination andgeneration of laser proofs.andM;In the booth will be a Macintosh and a Vax.andM;ANPAandM;The American Newspaper Publishers Association will have copies of the currentissue of its Presstime publication, plus the floor plan for next year'sANPA/TEC '90, to be held June 16-20 at the Las Vegas Convention Center.andP;  Stopby the booth to look at the layout.andP;  Membership materials will be available.andM;AmpersandandM;See Macintosh Newspaper GroupandM;AnayaandM;See Macintosh Newspaper GroupandM;Apple ComputerandM;See Macintosh Newspaper GroupandM;Associated PressandM;The Associated Press will demonstrate a variety of types of equipment,including some of its own and some developed elsewhere.andP;  Among them are LeafSystems' Leafax 35 negative transmitter, which was shown last year, and thebrand-new Leafspooler, both of which also will appear in the Leaf booth.andO;They are part of the overall news photo service, which includes thePhotoStream picture-a-minute delivery and PC- and Vax-based electronicdarkrooms.andP;  AP is moving toward all-digital transmission of photos, which itcurrently is testing.andM;Other services to be demonstrated include DataStream (news and sports) andDataFeature, which will be shown running at 9600 baud for the first time;SelectStocks; PrimeTime (news and columns); DataFeature Graphics forsyndicated graphics delivery; and a few others we have seen before.andM;New from AP is a text editing system using Nokia terminals, intended for useby reporters in a bureau environment.andP;  The terminal is based on an Intel80286 processor running at 6 or 8 MHz, with 1 MB of RAM, a 20-MB hard disk, a3-1/2-inch floppy, and a Nokia monochrome display controller with aresolution of 720 X 400 pixels.andP;  The editing program, called AP Edit, issimilar to editing programs AP has used over the years, but it has a fewenhancements.andM;ATandamp;TandM;ATandamp;T will demonstrate its voice communications systems, including an upgradedversion of its existing small voice communication system; ATandamp;T mailcapabilities; voice messaging; fax networking; and its Multiquest 900service.andM;Atex Publishing SystemsandM;Atex, a unit of Kodak's Electronic Pre-Press Systems (EPPS) division, istaking a new approach this year.andP;  It will focus on a theater presentationfeaturing its main products working in a newspaper environment, rather thangiving long demonstrations of its system capabilities.andM;Atex says the theater will include film, slides, original music and specialeffects to track a day in the life of a major newspaper and how itsadvertising, operations and editorial staffs (using Atex products) respond toa major news event.andP;  Five Sun workstations running Atex software will beavailable for use in the presentation.andM;The company cited two reasons for the change in its approach to the show: thefact that customers can better be served by getting their demonstrations inthe formal facilities at Atex's headquarters and that the traditional showdemonstrations are prohibitively expensive.andM;For the magazine market and small newspapers, which are served by PC andMacintosh products, Atex will have its traditional equipment demonstrations.andO;There will be two Writer workstations on a network that also will besupporting a PC PageMakeup station.andP;  One Design Software Macintosh will berunning as a standalone workstation.andM;Enhancement to the Writer network since we last saw it include significantones in the network and file management area, where the system now providesmore information in directories and easier tracking of stories.andP;  Anotheraddition is the ability to dedicate a server other than the file server tothe handamp;j task.andM;With a suitable Sun file server, the Writer network now supports more than 24PCs--its earlier limit.andP;  One network also can be connected to more than oneAtex host.andM;Enhancements to the handamp;j program include porting the Atex hyphenationdictionary to the Sun server and some additions to the commands supported.andO;Not yet completed is the ability for an operator at a Writer PC to compose ajob against the page geometry specified at the PC PageMakeup workstation.andM;Design Software will exhibit the new features previewed at the SeyboldSeminars in March.andM;Also on display will be the Series 30 Amigo system and PC Preferenceterminals for use in the Latin American market, supporting both editorial andclassified applications.andM;The PC-based 3000 system that was developed in the United Kingdom andintroduced recently for that market won't be in the booth.andP;  Atex says it isstill undertaking market research to determine where it will sell the 3000system.andM;Eastman Kodak.andP;  We don't expect any new prepress products in the Kodakportion of the booth, where the annual photography contest will be featured.andM;Auto-GraficaandM;Auto-Grafica, a graphic arts distributor that specializes in Spanish-languageproducts, will show a wide variety of hardware and software:andM;* Three Compugraphic imagesetters: a 9400PS, a 9600 and a 9700.andM;* A PC running Spanish-language classified software, a pagination system andAuto-Grafica's own AutoData composition system, which uses editing softwaredeveloped in Argentina.andM;* A Scitex Visionary color system.andM;* Deskset Design, G.O.andP;  Graphics' PC-based composition system, outputting toa laser printer.andM;* A PC with wire-service software running live from a ReutersSpanish-language feed.andM;AutologicandM;Autologic will demonstrate an assortment of low-, medium- and high-resolutionlaser imaging systems supporting PostScript and ICL input.andP;  Included will beAPS-800SX Page Image Processors (PIPS) with 190-MB font disks and high-speedinterfaces; APS-6/108 laser imagers; the Autologic Graphics Integrator (AGIe;PostScript RIPS; LZR 2600 (Dataproducts) and APS-6000 (Printware) laserprinters; the Microcomposer II composition system; Xerox 7650 scanners; andMacintosh and AT microcomputers.andM;These systems will be configured in a variety of ways using high-speed andSCSI interfaces, LocalTalk and Ethernet.andM;They will be generating full newspaper pages on 108-pica and 80-picahigh-resolution imagers and proof copies on low- and medium-resolution,plain-paper devices.andM;Graphics will be generated from multiple sources: PostScript (using variousapplication programs), the Autologic (ImagiTex) Graphics System and Autokonscanners for contone data, the Xerox 7650 for line art, and the AutologicDigitizing Center (ADC) for logos.andP;  (For more information on the ADC, see ourlast issue.)andM;Graphics will be stored on the AGI prior to being merged with text and outputon full pages.andM;New Graphics Input Command Language (GICL) software enhancements willincrease output speed, including producing round corner boxes, screen tints,boxes, pattern fills, reverses, vignettes and Bezier curves.andM;Autologic equipment will be found also in these booths: AP (APS-450 PIP, LZR2600); Harris (APS-800SX, APS-6/108S); Crosfield (APS-PS PIP, APS-6/108S);Dewar (APS-800S, APS-6/80); Macintosh Newspaper Group (APS-800SX PIP,APS-6/108S, AGI, APS-PS, LZR 2600, Xerox 7650); Mycro-Tek (APS-800, LZR2600); and CText (APS-800, LZR 2600).andM;Avalon DevelopmentandM;See Macintosh Newspaper GroupandM;BarcoandM;See Macintosh Newspaper GroupandM;BarneyscanandM;See Macintosh Newspaper GroupandM;BidcoandM;Bidco will introduce a new Front-Page 80C laser imager designed to handlecolor separation films 80 picas wide.andP;  The machine, which is rollfed, imagesat 18 inches per minute.andP;  Bidco claims an accuracy of within three mils(three one-thousandths of an inch) across the page.andP;  The secret to theaccuracy, we were told, is a completely new film transport.andM;Existing Front-Page 80 units will be upgradable to 80C models.andP;  The 80C willbe demonstrated outputting color separations generated on a Howtek colorsystem.andM;Pricing of the 80C machines, which serve OEM markets, hasn't been determined.andM;Bidco also said that 108-pica Front-PAge 100U machines will be upgradable toFP 100UC models for handling color output.andM;Also in the booth will be two items introduced last year: the RasterPaginator (a hardware device that takes data from three independent front-endsystems and outputs it on a page) and the Ripswitch for switching betweenmultiple RIPS.andM;Bidco also will demonstrate a Chelgraph interface that connects a ChelgraphRIP and a Bidco imager.andM;Bidco recently announced plans to interface its imagers to Berthold front-endsystems.andM;Birmy GraphicsandM;Birmy Graphics will show the large-format PageScan 2 laser printer, whichwill also be demonstrated in the Graphic Enterprises booth.andP;  It combinesGraphic Enterprises printing technology with Birmy's RIPS-basedPost-Script-compatible RIP.andM;The BirmySetter high-resolution PostScript-compatible imagesetter, which alsouses the RIPS-based RIP, will be shown in both 400mm (94-pica) and 300mm(72-pica) models.andP;  Their performance will be aided by the new X2 RIP--aprocessing &quot;tower&quot; containing two of Birmy's regular RIP cards.andP;  As files arespooled into the tower, each will be rasterized by the next available RIP;they will drive the imaging engine in turn.andP;  Birmy is hoping to showhigh-resolution photos being stored in the tower and low-resolution versionsof them being passed among network stations.andM;The company will also feature a new version of its spooling station softwarethat will perform better multitasking and enhance communication over multiplenetworks.andM;BrainworksandM;Brainworks has developed ad pricing and tracking software running on IBM 36and AS 400 computers.andP;  It also offers circulation software.andM;Display ads can be created on an ad system and the data can be then sent tothe IBM computer to produce a graphic layout, which can then be sent to acomposition system for pagination.andP;  The only interface currently available isto the Harris 8300, but the company says it will develop more.andP;  Display adscreated on a Harris workstation are sent to the IBM system for placement.andO;Page information is then sent back to the 8300 for pagination.andM;The pricing and tracking software handles daily, weekly and combination ads.andM;BurkelandM;This company, formed in 1984, has designed and developed products forSat-Fax.andP;  It is now marketing its products itself.andM;Burkel will demonstrate a brand-new system called PhotoStore, consisting ofthree boards residing in a PC.andP;  It was designed as a weather image capturingdevice for NASA and has been converted to handle storage of high-qualityphotographs.andP;  PhotoStore runs on IBM '386 computers running at 20 MHz.andP;  Itprovides facilities for inputting, outputting and viewing imagesimultaneously.andP;  It stores up to 100 photos before the automatic purgingfunction is activated.andM;PhotoStore supports ten queues, which can be allocated for differentcategories of photos (e.g., sports).andP;  Currently there aren't any facilitiesfor manipulation of photo data, such as those offered with full electronicdarkrooms, but these will be added later, we were told.andP;  However, it ispossible to output any wire service photo in video format to manipulate thedata on another device, such as a Macintosh.andM;The target market is newspapers with circulations of between 15,000 and100,000 daily.andM;A basic system costs $16,500.andM;Burkel also is developing a fiber-optic CRT photo receiver, calledPhotoPrint, but this may not be demonstrated this year.andP;  It will tie intoPhotoStore.andM;One product that will be demonstrated is the Sat-Fax SF-2000 transmitter,which has been shown before.andM;CamexandM;Camex will demonstrate a broad product line with some new items, including aMacintosh-based system for ad design and PostScript compatibility for theSuperSetter and Breeze.andP;  Also present will be the traditional displayadvertising and imagesetting products and the database management and add-onpagination products that have been shown in varying stages in recent years.andM;The company will highlight its integration products: classified paginationwith classified display ads in place and display ad stacking, whch accepts anelectronic dummy from any of several layout systems, extracts ads from theCamex database and prepares complete ad stacks with scanned images for theSuperSetter output system.andP;  The classified pagination system can beintegrated with a variety of front-end classified systems.andM;The Breeze display ad composition software will be demonstrated on a Sun-3/60platform, including significant enhancements to the system-wide databasemanagement umbrella with electronic job jacket tracking.andM;The Macintosh system for ad design will make its debut.andP;  As its namesuggests, it will focus on design, rather than production, providing a subsetof the Breeze at less cost.andM;In the output arena, the SuperSetter's BitCaster RIP will be shown with a newaccelerator option.andP;  It will be driving some additions to its recorderfamily, including the Ultre, Bidco and Linotype L500 engines.andP;  TheSuperSetter also will sport a PostScript interpreter developed by Camex toaccommodate input of PostScript files.andP;  The interpreter software can be addedto existing SuperSetters in the field.andM;Camex will provide a progress report on its extensive project to develop asystem for large newspapers, starting with the Houston Chronicle, where thephase II classified system is scheduled to be installed during the summer.andM;Camex's PC-based editorial and classified systems for smaller newspapers willbe shown running on both Compaq and PS/2 computers connected via Ethernet tothe other products in the booth.andP;  Software features will include thenews-hole pagination capability demonstrated at America East.andM;Finally, Camex, which acquired NSSE earlier this year, will demonstrate somenew alternatives for the DEC CMS/TMS customer base.andM;Chemco TechnologiesandM;Chemco Technologies, which no longer sells Hell scanners, will focus onconsumables and the remaining hardware products it distributes.andP;  Theseinclude the ECRAM Autokon 1000, both with the SCSI buffer and as a standalonecamera; the NewsScan facsimile transmission unit; and the Lightning Proofhigh-speed color proofing system.andM;Among the consumables will be a new infrared-sensitive paper developeda foruse in imagesetters using laser diodes.andM;Chemco will use some other products to help demonstrate its own offerings,including a Hyphen RIP, a Linotronic 200P and the Reuters Picture Desk, whichwill use a SCSI interface to output to an Autokon.andM;Compatible Systems EngineeringandM;Compatible Systems Engineering will show a developmental version of acomposition capability that can run as a background task.andP;  Users will be ableto perform composition straight from XyWrite or directly within PageSpec.andO;This software will run on a PC, either standalone or networked.andP;  PageSpec cannow display text created from Bitstream outlines in its layout boxes.andM;The PC-Page program, which merges composed galleys with pages created inPageSpec to produce page files for  typesetting, will also be demonstrated.andM;A prototype of a Mac version of PageSpec will be on display.andP;  That program,Quark Xpress, Aldus PageMaker and CSE's Macintosh-based editorial system,NewsLinx, will run on the same network as the PC-based products; this will bethe first time CSE has combined desktop and higher-end publishingapplications on a network.andM;A conversion product that changes L202 Cora code to L300 Cora code willalsomake its debut.andM;Computerease SoftwareandM;Computerease will highlight its Word Mover program, which combines wordprocessing, document tracking, communications and terminal emulation in oneintegrated package.andP;  It features customizable menus, mouse support, promptsand help screens.andP;  Since last year, it has been connected to InformationInternational, System Integrators and Crosfield CSI systems, as well as toAtex.andM;At the show, Computerease hopes to be able to log into an Atex system todemonstrate the facilities.andM;Also to be displayed is Page Control/AL, the manual and automatic ad dummyingprogram for newspapers, shoppers, magazines and other publications.andP;  It canbe used to size edition space requirements, plan placement of ads and printdummies and manifest reports.andM;Page Control/AL is now being used at the New York Times and the AtlantaConstitution.andP;  A version is distributed by Camex to produce display adpagination when output to the SuperSetter.andM;Computerease and Advanced Technical Solutions will cooperate to show aspecial version of Word Mover that supports issuing Atex style commands tosend stories into an Atex system in the background.andM;This will be the first showing of AutoFetch, a means of backing up an entireAtex queue to PC disks.andM;Other items in the booth will be the PCMPlus program for connecting PCs toAtex systems and SFAnet Editor, a network program for automated, two-waybackground communications between PC networks and Atex systems.andM;Computer Peripheral SciencesandM;CPS will have one of the broadest assortments of equipment on display at theshow, including its own editorial and classified systems, display andsoftware running on PCs and Macintoshes, pagination based on VenturaPublisher software, a color system, an OCR scanner and output devices fromChelgraph andBidco.andM;On the system side, there will be Astrotek 2000 and 3000 systems, which willfeature new pulldown menus and windows, as well as the full implementation ofthe product's ECS software.andP;
