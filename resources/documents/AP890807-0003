(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A retired Army brigadier general wasgiven two years probation Monday on his conviction for conspiracyto defraud the federal government.   George H. Young Jr., 68, of Leavenworth, Kan., pleaded guilty inJune to the count stemming from an investigation of him and hisdefense consulting company, the Milton Corp.   Young retired from the Army in 1971 after being censured forfailure to adequately investigate the massacre of South Vietnamesecivilians by American troops at My Lai in 1968.   The indictment, returned in Michigan, accused Young and thecompany of sending periodic monthly payments between 1984 and 1986to Army Capt. James McDowell of the Army Tank Automotive Command inWarren, Mich., ``in return for procurement information regardinggovernment defense contracts.''   McDowell told his superiors about contacts with Young andcooperated with federal investigators.   Ottawa Truck, a company from Ottawa, Kan., that was working ondevelopment of an all-terrain supply vehicle, was a client ofYoung's company. Ottawa Truck was not charged in the case, but wasnamed an unindicted co-conspirator.   Under a plea agreement with the U.S. attorney's office inDetroit, which prosecuted the case, a bribery charge to which Youngpleaded innocent was dismissed at sentencing.   U.S. District Judge Earl O'Connor ordered a three-year prisonterm for Young, but suspended the sentence and placed him on twoyears probation. A condition of probation requires Young to do upto 300 hours of community service work.   The case had been transferred to Kansas for the plea andsentencing because of Young's ailing health.</TEXT></DOC>
