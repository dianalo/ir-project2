FRAZIER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The local economy is holding togethermore than a year after the United States imposed sanctions on thegovernment, but increasingly it is a hand-to-mouth, day-to-dayexistence.   The sanctions of March and April 1988 were intended to force thedeparture of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian strongmanwho has been indicted in the United States on drug traffickingcharges.   Noriega, chief of the Defense Forces, is a central issue inSunday's presidential election.   Washington and the domestic political opposition accuse thegovernment of planning to cheat to ensure Noriega's handpickedcandidate victory.   The sanctions froze about $56 million in Panamanian governmentdeposits in U.S. banks and banned payments of taxes and some feesto Panamanian government entities.   The United States also is holding about $140 million in PanamaCanal payments in the name of Eric Delvalle, deposed by Noriega inMarch 1988 and still recognized by the United States as Panama'spresident.   Bank deposits are down sharply, huge sums have left the country,savings accounts remain frozen and cash is short; loan availabilityis down sharply as is new construction in what used to be a boomingPanama City.   Ironically, the survival of the economy is due mostly to whatthe United States and U.S. businesses spend here _ about $500million a year not counting the payrolls for 10,000 troops andseveral large American companies.   The businesses include a Texaco refinery, the trans-Panama oilpipeline and the Cherokee Land Co., which grows bananas but becauseof the sanctions does not pay government export taxes of about $1million a month.   The $500 million is about 12 percent of Panama's gross domesticproduct.   The government blames nearly all its problems on the sanctions,although the economic decline actually started in mid-1987, whenPanamanians worried about political instability started sendingmoney out of the country.   The government says the gross domestic product dropped 17.1percent last year, from $5 billion to $4.1 billion; Americaneconomists contend only about a fourth of the drop is due to thesanctions.   Panama, which uses the American dollar, has no central bank andcannot print more money unless it establishes its own currency,which then would be subject to inflationary pressures.   In a statement Wednesday, the government's National BankingCommission said the situation had hit bottom and was starting toimprove slightly.   But the commission said the banking system has a long way to gobefore returning to where it was before the crisis.   ``It still is necessary to increase the availability of loanfunds in banks. And this can be achieved if we Panamanians keep ourfunds in banks in Panama,'' it said.   Normally in Latin America, repatriation of capital flightfollows a period of political stability, something Panama may notsee for a time.   A Panamanian government assessment of damages from thesanctions, published in February, said its income was down 44percent. The study said the number of Panamanians below the povertyline has risen from 33 percent to 40 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
