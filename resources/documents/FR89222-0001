We anticipate that this proposal will not have anannual impact on the economy of more than $100 million. No major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, Stateor local government agencies, or geographic regions is anticipated. Thisaction is not expected to have significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofU.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domesticor export markets.This action has been reviewed with regard to requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). The Administrator of the Food and NutritionService (FNS), has certified that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under10.550 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 whichrequires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials(7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V and final rule related notice published June24, 1983 (48 FR 29112).In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520)the additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements contained in andSection;250.15 of this rule are subject to review and approval by the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB). Current reporting and recordkeeping requirementsfor Part 250 were approved by OMB under control number 0584-0007.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Section 250.30 of the current regulations sets forth most of the termsand conditions under which State distributing agencies, subdistributingagencies and recipient agencies may enter into contracts with food processorsto incorporate government-donated commodities into processed end products.On February 2, 1988, the Department published a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 2846-2849) to amend the Food DistributionProgram Regulations to strengthen provisions concerning the processingof donated foods and to increase uniformity between provisions governingState processing activities and those governing the National CommodityProcessing Program (Part 252). The proposed rule provided a forty-five-daycomment period. Under the proposed rule, all references to the State processingprogram were found in andSection; 250.15. Since that time, the overall revisionof Part 250 regulations was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 3, 1988 (53 FR 20416-20556). Most referencesto the State processing program are now contained in andSection; 250.30.Several other portions of this final rule have been renumbered to fit inthe revised Part 250.In an effort to enhance processing activities for the 1988-89 school year,those provisions which relate to alternative value-pass-through systemsand the crediting of a distributor's account for the value of the donatedfood contained in an end product were finalized separately and publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 6, 1988 (53 FR 20597-20599).This final rule addresses those provisions regarding sales verification,contract duration, end product data, contract termination, refund applications,performance reports, annual reconciliation and audits.Processing agreements received after the date of this rule are subjectto the 30-days provisions contained herein. However, processing agreementswhich have been substantially reviewed or which have been approved priorto this date may remain in effect for the duration of the contract or untilJune 30, 1989, which ever occurs first.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments</ITAG>A total of 158 comment letters were received from various entities suchas the American School Food Service Association, National Association ofState Agencies for Food Distribution, National Frozen Pizza Institute andDairy Institute of California. Other commenters included processors, distributors,local school food authorities, State distributing agencies, private consultantsand members of the U.S. Congress.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sales Verification</ITAG>Under andSection; 250.15 of the proposed rule, State distributing agenciesor processors were required to conduct a statistically valid sample ofprocessor sales twice a year rather than quarterly. The statistical samplemust produce a sales verification confidence level of 95 percent.Ten of the commenters supported the provisions to reduce the workload associatedwith quarterly sales verification. Twelve commenters recommended maintainingthe quarterly verification requirement stating that the verification ofsales must take place soon after the purchase of the end products. Thesecommenters claim that it becomes increasingly difficult to verify salesas the time between the sale and the verification increases. Several commentersrecommended that sales verification be done monthly. Two commenters agreedthat reducing the verification requirement to twice a year was good; however,language should be added so the processors would not be prohibited fromverifying sales more often. One commenter recommended requiring deliveryreceipts from distributors stating that this would eliminate the need toconduct a sales verification at all.The Department believes that reducing the frequency of verification ofsales and the submission of the data from quarterly to twice a year willreduce the State distributing agencies' and processors' work load, whileproviding sufficient data to accomplish the monitoring goals. However,since many commenters believe that sales verification should take placemore frequently, andSection;andSection; 250.19(b)(2)(i) and 250.30(m)(1)(ix)is being revised in this final rule to require that sales verificationbe conducted twice a year, <T3>at a minimum, </T3> and andSection; 250.30(m)(1)(ix) is being revisedto require sales verification reports to be submitted twice a year in conjunctionwith the sales verification requirement contained in andSection; 250.19(b)(2)(i).If a State distributing agency or processor wants to verify sales morefrequently, they may do so. However, the Department is further recommendingthat verification efforts take place in a timely manner to ensure thatrecipient agencies can readily recall the purchases being verified. Underthe proposed rule, the sales verification sample size must ensure a 95percent confidence level.Four commenters commented on this provision stating that State distributingagencies do not have the expertise to set up sampling procedures whichguarantee a 95 percent confidence level. They commented that guidelinesfor ensuring this degree of accuracy should be established by the Departmentand furnished to the State distributing agencies.In order to be consistent with the NCP regulations, andSection; 250.30(b)(2)will remain as proposed in this final rule. However, guidelines will befurnished by the Department so State distributing agencies will be ableto determine a sample size which will ensure a 95 percent confidence level.Section 250.15(b)(2) of the proposed rule also required the adjustmentof performance reports and processing inventory reports to reflect invalidsales which were identified as a result of the sales verification effortand the development and submission of a corrective action plan by the processordesigned to correct deficiencies. This change to the regulations was proposedto ensure that recipient agencies receive the benefit of the donated foodand that the value pass-through-system being used is accountable.No comments were received regarding this proposed change. Therefore, therequirement as proposed is being incorporated in andSection; 250.30(b)(2)of this final rule.Section 250.15(b)(2) of the proposed rule required State distributing agenciesto review the processors' sales verification systems and findings in instancesin which the responsibility for sales verification has been delegated tothe processor.As part of the distributing agency's review of the processor's sales verificationsystem, andSection; 250.15(b)(2) of the proposed rule required State distributingagencies to select a sub-sample of at least 10 percent of all sales verifiedby the processor by contacting the recipient agency either by telephoneor through written correspondence. The reverification of these sales willassist that State distributing agency in determining the efficacy of theprocessor's sales verification system.Eighteen commenters opposed this provision stating that the 10 percentreverification by States should not be required, especially if the originalsample verified by the processors was 95 percent accurate. Seven of thesecommenters stated that the State reverification of sales imposes an additionalworkload on State distributing agencies that will not be funded by USDA.Three commenters felt that the reverification of sales should not be imposedon the State distributing agencies but should be included as part of theCPA audit required of all processors.The Department continues to support the requirement for State distributingagencies to reverify processor-verified sales information. Based on verificationsconducted by the Department, there is a significant error rate in reportingsales. The only way to ensure that performance report figures are accurateis to verify the figures with the recipient agencies on a regular basis.Reverification of reported sales will ensure that sales reported by processorswere actually made in the amounts reported.Making reverification a part of the CPA audit requirement will not accomplishthe goal of annual reverification because an audit is not required of allprocessors each year. Only multi-State processors are required to obtainCPA audits. The frequency of these CPA audits is based on the cumulativevalue of donated food received under all processing agreements. There isa minimum requirement that multi-State processors obtain a CPA audit atleast once every three years.The proposed rule contained a requirement that in instances in which poorprocessor performance is revealed, the State distributing agency must requirethe processor to discontinue the abused value-pass-through system, initiatean audit or review to determine the extent to which sales are to be disallowed,establish a claim and/or terminate the contract.One commenter recommended that the language referring to ``discontinuanceof the abused value pass through system'' be removed from the rule. Thiscommenter believed that abuse of a value pass-through system should resultin claims activity and/or termination of the agreement. The commenter didnot believe the processor should be permitted to make and report any salesuntil problems are corrected and claims paid.In the event problems are discovered with a particular value-pass-throughsystem or with a particular distributor, the Department does not believethe processor should automatically be prohibited from selling productsunder another system(s) or through another distributor. Such action wouldalso adversely affect recipient agencies' purchases if the supply of aprocessed product was abruptly ended. It should be noted, however, thateven though other systems or distributors are still being used, the Stateshould pursue claims activity, if warranted. For these reasons, we areretaining the provision as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Contract Duration</ITAG>Under andSection; 250.15(c) of the proposed rule, all processing contractswould terminate as of June 30 of each year.Twenty-seven commenters supported this provision as proposed while twelvewere opposed. The majority of the commenters who opposed this provisionbelieved that processing contracts should be renewable. Ten commentersbelieved that by renewing agreements and updating price and yield information,the time needed for contract approval could be significantly reduced. Theyalso believed that the time needed to approve new agreements each yearresulted in delayed shipments of commodities to processors, thereby causingproblems with deliveries of end products to schools for the opening ofschool.Two commenters saw the June 30 date as arbitrary. Having all agreementsterminate on that date may prohibit summer feeding programs from havingprocessed commodities available to them. Two commenters believed that agreementinformation should be available by March 1 so agreements can be approvedand end products available to recipient agencies for the beginning of school.The Department continues to support the June 30 termination date for processingcontracts. Establishing this date will help regularize those activitiesassociated with audits and management evaluation reviews. Also, this provisionis consistent with NCP regulations. However, this will not preclude a Statedistributing agency's decision from beginning contract negotiations forthe upcoming year prior to the termination date of the existing contract.By doing this, contracts which are reviewed and approved prior to July1, but effective July 1, will ensure processed end products are availableto all programs for a one year period.<ITAG tagnum="84">End Product Data</ITAG>Under andSection; 250.15(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed rule, the Department eliminatedthe requirement that processors list the quantity of non-donated food inend products. Processors would have to identify these ingredients to providecontracting agencies with information for which they have expressed a needwhile ensuring that information which is considered to be ``trade secrets''by some processors is not disclosed.Eighteen commenters supported this provision as it was proposed. Twelvecommenters were opposed. Three commenters who opposed the provision didso stating a need to know the quantity of non-donated food in order toperform nutrient analyses of the end products. Several commenters saidthey need to know the amount of non-donated food contained in an end productin order to calculate yield, quantity and price factors. Two commenterssuggested that processors list the total quantity of non-donated food asit will enable them to calculate the percentage of donated food in theformula and it will not give away of the companies' ``trade secrets.''One commenter said the information was necessary to verify production runs.One commenter expressed a need for the information and stated that if itwere not supplied, State distributing agencies should require copies ofCN labels or product specifications. One commenter said the ingredientinformation is necessary to compare similar products between companies.Three commenters claimed they must have information regarding non-donatedfood ingredients for food allergy reactions and therapeutic diets. Onecommenter stated that even flavorings and seasonings should be sublistedto avoid allergy problems.The Department has decided to make final the proposed change. Processorsmust provide State distributing agencies with basic information concerningproducts, but can be assured that ``trade secrets'' need not be disclosed.Processors will continue to be required to identify all ingredients containedin an end product. By knowing all the ingredients in the formula, Stateand recipient agencies will be able to compare formulas for similar productsand identify ingredients which may trigger allergic reactions. The specificamount of each nondonated food ingredient will not have to be identified.The total weight of the batch, however, will have to be specified so thepercentage of donated food in the formula can be determined.<ITAG tagnum="84">Value-Pass-Through Systems</ITAG>Under andSection; 250.15(e) of the proposed rule, a requirement was addedthat processors ensure that distributors maintain copies of invoices issuedto recipient agencies when end products are sold through a discount system.Furthermore, the invoices must be provided to the processor upon request.This change to the regulation was proposed to significantly reduce theflow of paper between processors and distributors, while ensuring accountability.It was also proposed that processors retain such invoices.One comment was received regarding this proposed change concerning distributors.The commenter supported this provision but claimed it would be difficultto enforce. The distributor's invoices are essential to an accountableprocessing program. Once food is delivered to a recipient agency, the distributorissues an invoice that generates payment by the recipient agency. It isessential that copies of invoices be maintained as back up for sales figureswhich are reported on the processors' monthly performance reports. It isnot essential that distributors provide processors with copies of all invoicesfor sales of processed end products. Distributors, however must maintainthis information. For this reason, the requirement as proposed is beingincorporated in andSection; 250.30(e) of this final rule. The requirementthat processors retain invoices has also been made final in andSection; 250.30(d).Section 250.15 (d) and (e) of the proposed rule required that processorsensure that all invoices, both processor generated and distributor generated,clearly indicate the discount included or refund due on the end product,and that the invoices clearly identify that the discount included or refundpayment due is for the value of the donated food, regardless of the valuepass through system used. This change to the regulations was proposed toensure that recipient agencies are receiving the benefits of the donatedfood contained in the end products.Six commenters supported this provision as proposed while seventeen wereopposed. The majority of the commenters who opposed this provision believedthat modifications to distributor invoice systems to implement the requirementwould be overly expensive and inconvenient. One commenter stated that thisrequirement places processors in the impossible position of attemptingto dictate how their distributor customers do business. The commenter alsobelieved that processors would not be able to enforce the requirement.One commenter stated that the requirement was not necessary and includinganother figure on the invoice, raises the possibility that recipient agencieswill pay the wrong figure. Several commenters stated that processors cannotrequire distributors to ``double price'' items on invoices. Three commentersdid not agree that distributor invoices need to include the amount of therefund due.Those commenters who supported the proposed rule did so because they believedthe requirement would help document that the recipient agency receivedthe full value pass through of the donated food. They believed it eliminatesconfusion by telling recipient agencies up front when they have receiveda discounted price or when they are due a refund. One commenter statedthat the proposed rule was a good idea especially for end products soldunder the refund system. The invoice will serve as a reminder to the recipientagency to submit a refund application to the processor.The Department continues to support the requirement that the distributors'invoice clearly indicate the discount included or refund due on an endproduct. It is impossible to document that the contract value of donatedfood has been passed on to recipient agencies unless this value is clearlyidentified to the recipient agency. The best document for verifying thata discount was passed on to recipient agencies or informing recipient agenciesof the refund due them is the invoice. The discount or refund informationmust appear on the invoice whether it is generated by the processor orthe distributor.<ITAG tagnum="84">Contract Termination</ITAG>Under andSection; 250.16(j) of the proposed rule, the option of requiringpayment for commodities remaining in a processor's inventory based on theCCC unrestricted sales price had been added.Three commenters were in favor of this provision while twenty were opposed.Two commenters suggested that we define what the CCC unrestricted salesprice is. Fourteen commenters who opposed this provision recommended thatprocessors not be required to pay the CCC unrestricted sales price forcommodities remaining in inventory. One commenter did not think it wasfair to require processors to pay for remaining inventory at the terminationof an agreement only to have to turn around and order more food to startup a new year. One commenter stated that processors should have the optionof paying for the inventory or transferring it to another processor. Anothercommenter questioned why a processor must pay for meat that cannot be soldor exchanged.Sections 250.30 (j)(1)(i)(D) and (j)(1)(ii)(F) are added to the final ruleas proposed in order to maintain consistency with the NCP regulations.However, if processing contracts are going to be approved for another year,payment for the inventory will not be required unless the carry over inventoryis in excess of a six months supply. Under no circumstances will processorsbe permitted to maintain donated food inventory in excess of a six-monthsupply based on the processor's average monthly usage, unless a higherlevel has been specifically approved by the State distributing agency onthe basis of written justification submitted by the processor.<ITAG tagnum="84">Refunds</ITAG>Under the proposed rule, andSection; 250.15(k) was revised to require thesubmission of refund applications by recipient agencies and distributorswithin 30 days of receipt of the processed end product by the recipientagency. Also, processors were required to make payment within 30 days afterreceipt of any refund application. However, at the end of the contractperiod, processors were required to make refunds as soon as possible, butnot later than 60 days after the close of the contract period. The Departmentalso specifically solicited comments as to whether the time period associatedwith the submission of refund applications should be tied to the date theend product was purchased, date the end product was received or some othertime period.Fourteen of the commenters support this provision as proposed while eighty-threewere opposed. Fifteen commenters were opposed to the requirement that recipientagencies submit refund applications within 30 days stating that 30 daysdoes not allow for sufficient time for a large school district to compiledata needed to complete the refund application. One commenter believedthe date of submission of the refund appication should be tied to the datethe invoice is received. Several commenters believed the date of submissionshould be tied to the date the product is received. Nine commenters statedthat the date of submission should be within 30 days of the close of themonth of purchase rather than having to submit applications within 30 daysof receipt of the product. The commenters believed that by making thischange recipient agencies can submit one refund application to cover allpurchases made during the preceding month.Sixty-six commenters were opposed to giving processors 30 days to pay refunds.These commenters want processors to continue making refund payments within10 days of receipt of the application. Many of these commenters statedthat it is unrealistic to have to wait 30 days to receive money due therecipient agency. Such a requirement would have a negative effect on aschool system's cash flow.Based on the comments received in response to the proposed rule, andSection;250.30, paragraph (k) is amended in this final rule by changing the words``30 days'' to ``30 days from the close of the month of purchase.'' Thiswould give recipient agencies 30 days to complete the information on purchasesfor the preceding month and submit a refund application to cover all purchasesmade that month. The Department believes this will be less costly and timeconsuming than requiring the recipient agency to keep track of refund applicationdeadlines for each individual purchase. Also, the proposed provision thatprocessors make payment within 30 days of receipt of any refund applicationis being changed. Large processors with staffs that work exclusively onrecords and reports for the processing program are able to process refundchecks expeditiously. Also, the majority of the commenters want processorsto continue making refund payments within 10 days of receipt of the application.They requested that the Department retain the original requirement as itwas. For these reasons, the proposed requirement is being amended in thefinal rule to retain the requirement that processors make refund paymentswithin 10 days of receipt of any refund application.The final rule is also being amended from the proposed rule to remove therequirement that processors make refund payments as soon as possible, butno later than 60 days after the close of the contract period. Recipientagencies will have a deadline for submitting refund applications at theclose of the contract year. Processors will have 10 days from receipt ofthe final refund application to make payment to the recipient agency.<ITAG tagnum="84">Performance Reports</ITAG>Under andSection; 250.15(m) of the proposed rule, the requirement that processorsreport the number of pounds of each donated food represented in sales todistributors was deleted.Fourteen commenters supported this change to the regulations stating thatthere was no need to know the number of pounds of donated food in end productsat distributors. Only one commenter favored maintaining the requirement.The Department continues to support the requirement as proposed; however,processors must maintain distributor inventory information as part of theoverall inventory control system to ensure an acceptable audit trail. Section250.30(m) of this final rule is being amended accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">Annual Reconciliation</ITAG>Section 250.15(n)(3) of the proposed rule contained new language requiringthat as part of the annual reconciliation process processors must pay distributingagencies for all donated food remaining at contract termination, unlessthe processor has entered into a contract for the next year. In that circumstancethe processor would be required to pay the distributing agency for anydonated food inventory in excess of approved levels.Fourteen commenters supported this provision; however, the majority ofthese commenters wanted the regulations to include the provision requiringthat at agreement termination, processors who have gone into negative inventorystatus should be made whole at that time. Four commenters opposed the provisionas proposed, pointing out the donated food inventory could be transferredto another processor or State at agreement termination or returned to theState which initiated the agreement. These commenters stated that paymentfor donated food should not be the only option available at contract termination.The provisions under andSection; 250.30(n)(3) of the regulations were intendedto address the handling of excess amounts of commodity inventory at thetime of annual reconciliation for processors who will continue their contractualrelationship with the distributing agency. This section does not addresswhat is to be done with inventory remaining or commodities unaccountedfor at the termination or completion of processing contracts. The provisionsfor termination and completion of processing contracts are found in andSection;250.30(j). Based on the comments received on the proposed rule, it is clearthat confusion has been created by these two sections. Therefore, andSection; 250.30(n)(3) as contained in this final rule, makesclear that at annual reconciliation, processors who will continue theirprocessing relationship with the distributing agency will be required topay for commodities in excess of the level approved by the distributingagency. Section 250.30(j)(1) has also been changed to reflect the long-standingpractice that at termination or completion of contractual relations witha distributing agency, if the processor has commodities remaining in inventoryor unaccounted for, the processor shall return the commodities to the contractingagency or pay for the commodities as required by that section. Further,a technical change to andSection; 250.30(q)(5) was necessitated by theseamendments. This corresponding change embodies no new policy decision,but was omitted from the proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Audits </ITAG>Under the proposed rule the Department revised andSection; 250.15(t) of theregulations by stating that the audit frequency was determined by addingthe value of donated foods received under State and National CommodityProcessing contracts. No comments were received regarding this requirement. Therefore the requirementas proposed has been retained in andSection; 250.18(b)(1) of this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 250 </ITAG>Aged, Agricultural commodities, Business and industry, Food assistanceprograms, Food donations, Food processing, Grant programs-social programs,Infants and children, Price support programs, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, School breakfast and lunch programs, Surplus agriculturalcommodities.
