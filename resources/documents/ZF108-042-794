 &quot;Despair lurks in the threat to human autonomy, to thevery essence of what makes us human -- our individual and collective abilityto reason about the world and control our destiny.&quot;andM;The Social Context of Artificial Intelligence, a report released earlier thisyear by a 13-member NRC subcommittee consisting of academics and laborrepresentatives from across the country, culminates work began in February1988.andP;  While the boundaries of AI range from information technologies tosocial implications of office automation, the group agreed to study theinter-relationship between AI and work, decision making, privacy, andsocietal structure, ethics and political adaptation.andP;  However, the reportnotes it is difficult to distinguish between the social implications stemmingfrom the use of computers in general, and those arising out of artificialintelligence applications in particular.andM;Artificial intelligence research, including expert systems, enables a varietyof automated systems to be developed; for example:andM;* an expert system for advice in the handling of hazardous waste;andM;* a financial investment assistant for portfolio management;andM;* and, a system to advise students in career planning.andM;The report states that expertise -- or more importantly the retention ofexpertise as characterized by expert systems -- is a rare commodity and theavailability of mechanisms to preserve and disseminate it are to be valued.andM;&quot;The issue of computer decision making does not begin with AI, but ratherthat the reliance on AI may exacerbate the potential problem in a fundamentalway.&quot;andM;According to the report, problems lie in the unregulated proliferation of&quot;bad rules&quot; or the software that governs an AI system; essentially whodecides what is right and wrong?andP;  The report stresses that voluntarystandards developed by the Canadian Standards Association (currently servingas a model for ISO standard development) should be followed by developers ofAI software.andM;Implications of AI in job displacement, the report concludes, raise basicphilosophical questions such as income distribution, self-worth and the basicpolitical organization of a society, especially in terms of individualprivacy.andM;&quot;Expert systems and AI are being used by police forces in some countries ininvestigations, including surveillance (especially of cross-filed data), andwill surely be used in the business world for similar purposes ifcost-effective.&quot;andM;The expert systems branch of artificial intelligence -- which currently hasthe most applications -- was criticized for its marketing techniques.andP;  &quot;Theextravagant claims of some commercial companies in the marketing of their AIproducts have created concerns amongst researchers and among moreconservative firms ...andP;  In the U.K.andP;  it has been proposed that an AI industryassociation is needed with a code of ethics for advertising in order ...andP;  tomaintain ethical standards for the AI community.&quot;andM;However, the authors note that if such a regulatory mechanism is required, itwill be extremely difficult to establish and achieve.andP;  &quot;Let the buyer beware&quot;in concert with public education and individual ethical integrity will guidethe AI industry for now.andM;In attempting to determine the confines of their study, the committee assumedthat applications of AI include, but are not limited to:andM;* natural language processing;andM;* machine translation;andM;* expert systems, such as those used in the diagnosis and treatment ofdisease, monitoring and diagnosing faults in equipment, industrial plants,telecommunications, and electrical utility systems;andM;* operations scheduling and process planning in manufacturing;andM;* and, robot and other autonomous systems with vision or other sensingcapabilities that permit them to respond to changes in their externalenvironment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
