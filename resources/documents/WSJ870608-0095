Carl Channell, president of the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty, and Richard Miller, a public relations consultant, have each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to defraud the federal government. The fraud involved abuse of the organization's tax-exempt status by raising funds to arm Nicaraguan rebels.    Critics of independent prosecutor Lawrence Walsh say the rationale for the charges is unfounded, and they challenge the use of the tax laws as the basis for trying to unravel and prosecute a scandal involving foreign aid and arms sales. &quot;The problem,&quot; says Bruce Fein, a legal expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, &quot;is with using the tax laws to go after alleged crimes that have nothing to do with taxes. . . . If you have substantive offenses that are the primary target of the investigation, those are the crimes that ought to be charged and proven.&quot;    Syndicated columnist Edwin Yoder was also critical, calling the charges &quot;petty abuses of the Internal Revenue regulations.&quot;    But some recent Supreme Court precedents seem to lend support to Mr. Walsh's tactics. And Bernard Wolfman, a Harvard Law School professor and one of the nation's foremost experts on tax law, says it's clear that the prosecutions were a proper use of the tax laws. &quot;In my mind, it isn't even a matter for debate,&quot; he says.    The tax laws, particularly use of tax-exempt status, must be consistent with public policy, says Mr. Wolfman. Because Congress prohibited U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, he says tax-exempt fund raising can't be used for that purpose, either.    His argument proceeds in two steps and sheds light on the strategy of Mr. Walsh, who hasn't discussed the prosecutions publicly.    First, when the Internal Revenue Service gives tax-exempt status to an organization and allows its contributors to deduct their contributions, that is a form of federal subsidy.    &quot;A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income,&quot; the Supreme Court said in a 1983 decision written by Justice William Rehnquist, now chief justice.    Second, when Congress has expressly prohibited the use of federal funds for military aid to the rebels, known as Contras, the restriction applies to tax subsidies as well, Mr. Wolfman says.    &quot;The notion that the tax system can grant subsidies to activity that Congress has said is illegal on its face is absurd,&quot; says Mr. Wolfman.    Support for this view is found in another recent controversy over public policy and the tax laws. In 1983, the Supreme Court upheld the IRS's denial of tax-exempt status to Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C., because the school discriminated against blacks.    In an opinion by then Chief Justice Warren Burger, the high court discussed at length the historical purpose of recognizing charitable organizations, that they provide some &quot;public benefit.&quot; The court added, &quot;A corollary to the public benefit principle is the requirement . . . that the purpose of a charitable trust may not be illegal or violate established public policy.&quot;    The law at the center of the case is section 501(c)3 of the federal tax laws. It provides tax-exempt status to groups that are organized for &quot;religious, charitable, scientific . . . literary or educational purposes.&quot; Another provision permits donors to such groups to deduct their contributions.    According to the criminal charge filed against Mr. Channell by Mr. Walsh, the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty was recognized by the IRS as an &quot;educational and charitable organization devoted to the study, analysis and evaluation of the American socio-economic and political systems.&quot;    But in recent years, the endowment and other Channell companies raised money for weapons for the Contras, including $3.1 million specifically mentioned in the charges against Messrs. Channell and Miller.    Mr. Wolfman argues that Mr. Channell's organization wouldn't have been entitled to its tax exemption even in the absence of the congressional restriction on aid to the Contras, called the Boland amendment. Raising funds to arm the rebels, he says, &quot;is completely political; it's not charitable in my view.    &quot;If they had said in their application that their purpose was to raise money for arms, there isn't a chance the IRS would have granted them an exemption or deductibility,&quot; Mr. Wolfman says. </TEXT></DOC>
