Sunday marks the official beginning of the withdrawal of Soviettroops from Afghanistan under accords signed April 14 in Geneva,which subcommittee chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called``the first glimmer of peace for the people of Afghanistan innearly nine years.''   The accords call for half the Soviet troops to be pulled out ofAfghanistan by Aug. 15, and for the pullout to be completed by Feb.15, 1989.   The congressional report said it was likely that no majormovement of the estimated 5 million refugees who fled their countryinto Pakistan and Iran would occur before this fall or next spring.   ``For the very reason refugees flee their homelands _ conflict,violence and political strife _ they are not likely to return untilthose conditions are resolved,'' the report stated.   The panel hailed Pakistan's program to handle the refugees,including support from the United Nations, and said it easily couldbe converted into a repatriation mechanism. But it will face majorchallenges in providing food supplies, seeds and farm implementsand medical care inside Afghanistan.   ``Therefore the U.N. and the international community must beprepared to function within Afghanistan to the maximum degreepossible, even in the absence of clear governmental authority,''the committee concluded.   It noted that the political situation was likely to remainvolatile and that the current Soviet-backed regime of Najib mayresist repatriation, particularly since most refugees oppose thegovernment.   Some Afghan resistance leaders also may hinder the relocationefforts in an attempt to use the refugees as political leverage,the panel said.   Costs of such a large-scale repatriation program have beenestimated from as low as $46 million to a high of $1.5 billion, thereport noted. The United Nations has put the cost of returning 2million refugees _ the number expected to participate in a U.N.program _ at about $226 million.   Working to the advantage of the repatriation effort is the factthat some 80 percent of the refugees previously resided withinabout 150 miles of the border in rural, agrarian communities.   ``The vast majority of the refugees will return to retill thelands their families have farmed for generations,'' the reportnoted.   ``It is likely that many refugees will be able simply to walkhome,'' it said.   But the challenges are daunting, the subcommittee said.Officials in the region are particularly concerned about largenumbers of land mines and other explosives still buried throughoutAfghanistan.   And roads needed to haul supplies and food to returnees, and theirrigation systems needed to support agriculture once they return,will have to be rebuilt, it said.</TEXT></DOC>
