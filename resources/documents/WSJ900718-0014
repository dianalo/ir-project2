On tests, the discovery well, the Al-Hazmiah No. 1, flowedat a rate of 4,300 barrels a day, according to Hisham Nazer,Saudi oil minister and chairman of Saudi Aramco, the oilcompany.</LP><TEXT>   This is the sixth oil find by Saudi Aramco -- most of it ahigh-quality type that is much in demand world-wide -- in thekingdom's central province in the past 13 months.   But earlier hopes of high government officials that thesefinds would prove to be linked into one vast giant field --bigger even than the kingdom's Ghawar, the world's largest --are fading.   Recent interviews with geologists and other oilexploration experts familiar with the drilling effort inSaudi Arabia's central province confirm that the finds appearto be separate fields. Also, they are relatively small bySaudi standards. They are expected to hold reserves of around500 million barrels each, minor additions to Saudi Arabia'sproven oil reserves of more than 250 billion barrels, orone-fourth the world's total.   Still, the finds are significant. They are turning up newoil reserves well away from the original concessions held bythe old Saudi-American consortium of Aramco in the main oilprovince of eastern Saudi Arabia. Exploration experts notedthat the source rock of this new oil is a Silurian shalebelieved to be 300 million to 350 million years old, comparedwith some 250 million years for the source rock in theoriginal producing area to the east.   More important, much of the oil in the vicinity of thediscoveries isn't only light in density but also low insulfur content. That makes it a &quot;sweet&quot; crude, a high-qualitygrade that is similar to Louisiana's sweet crude. Severalattractions permit these crudes to draw premium prices. Theypollute less than the heavier high-sulfur grades that aregenerally produced in the Middle East. They also yield morepreferred fuels such as gasoline.   Mr. Nazer confirmed that the Al-Hazmiah well's oil testedfree from sulfur and that its gravity measured 48 degrees API(American Petroleum Institute). The higher the gravity, thelighter the oil. The lightest crude Saudi Arabia currentlyproduces in commercial quantities is Berri, which is 39degrees API. But the chief Saudi crude, Arabian Light,measures only 34 degrees. The kingdom's other crudes are evenmore dense.   A mix of sweet crudes would improve the kingdom's revenuebase. Although it is the world's largest oil exporter, SaudiArabia restricts its output to 5.4 million barrels a dayunder the quota system of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries. The drop of some $4 a barrel in OPEC'soil prices in recent months has reduced Saudi Arabia'srevenue by more than $20 million a day.   Individuals close to developments said Saudi Aramco hastwo drilling rigs operating in the area south of Riyadh. Thekingdom is understood to have plans to spend at least $500million over the next five years in developing fields there.   Mr. Nazer said the Al-Hazmiah well is about 130 milessouth of Riyadh. It is only about six miles south of theAl-Howtah field, the first discovery in the central province.Depths of the discoveries range between 6,000 and 9,000 feet,Mr. Nazer said.</TEXT></DOC>
