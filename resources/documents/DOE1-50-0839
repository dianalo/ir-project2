The purpose of the document is to provide an overviewof the known biological effects of magnetic fields, to identify gapsin this knowledge so that direction for further research can be given,and to provide information for health authorities and regulatory agencieson the possible effects of magnetic-field exposure on human health, sothat guidance can be given on the assessment of risks from occupationaland general population exposure. Subjects reviewed include: the physicalcharacteristics of magnetic fields; measurement techniques; applicationsof magnetic fields and sources of exposure; mechanisms of interaction;biological effects; and guidance on the development of protective measures,such as regulations or safe-use guidelines. Health agencies and regulatoryauthorities are encouraged to set up and develop programmes that ensurethat the maximum benefit occurs with the lowest exposure. It is hopedthat this criteria document will provide useful information for the developmentof national protection measures against magnetic fields. 550 references,8 figures, 18 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
