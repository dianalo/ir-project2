Predictably, opposition parties and unions are demanding more spending to create jobs to reduce West Germany's seemingly chronic unemployment.    Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union showed unexpected signs of vulnerability Sunday. While the government coalition retained a healthy majority, the appeal of Mr. Kohl's party visibly shrank against gains for the Free Democrats, the junior coalition partner. The Free Democrats have called for sweeping tax cuts.    Following the Bundesbank's discount-rate cut last week, proponents for more West German economic growth are quickly shifting their focus from the central bank to the Bonn government as the next source of stimulus for a slowing economy.    Demands for lower taxes and more spending contradict Mr. Kohl's policies of the past four years. But analysts expect pressure on Bonn to increase if the economy continues to slow this year.    &quot;Bonn's federal budget deficit of between $11 billion and $13.8 billion is only about 1%&quot; of the nation's output of goods and services, asserted Geoffrey Dennis, an analysts for James Capel andamp; Co., a London brokerage. &quot;This is perceived by many to be too contracted, and we clearly can expect pressure to shift from the central bank to the government,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
