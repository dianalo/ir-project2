How many miners will join the strike is still uncertain, but alabor union official told the Tass news agency that miners in theKuznetsk basin in western Siberia will stop work on Wednesday toprotest the Communist Party's slow pace of reform.   A widespread strike by the stridently anti-communist minersduring the party congress would embarrass the Kremlin leadershipand President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, especially since the Communistdelegates asked them to stay on the job.   Vyacheslav Golikov, chairman of the Council of Workers'Committees of the Kuznetsk coal basin, said at a news conference inthe western Siberia city of Kemerovo that the miners do not want todamage Russia, but working people must be protected, Tass reported.   In some areas of the Kuznetsk basin, miners have decided toconcentrate on repair or maintenance jobs rather than working inthe pits, Tass said.   In the Donetsk coal basin of the Ukraine, members of the Councilof Strike Committees also have decided to strike for one day,although some of the rank-and-file miners still are discussing it,and a final decision will be made by the regional council onSunday, the news agency said.   The largest strike committee in the Donetsk basin, DonetskugolAmalgamation, is against the stoppage, Tass added.   A correspondent for the national evening news program``Vremya,'' in a spot survey at the Mushketovskaya pit, saidtwo-thirds of the 75 workers on the day shift Thursday supportedthe strike.   A national miners' congress last month voted to strike if PrimeMinister Nikolai Ryzhkov and his cabinet do not resign. The minersblame Ryzhkov for an unpopular economic reform plan, now beingrevised, that called for drastic price increases but only minorsteps toward a market economy.   They also condemned the Communist Party for hindering reforms.They also demand that the party cells be removed from theworkplace, as well as the armed forces and the KGB secret police.   Golikov told Tass that the crisis can be averted by thedevelopment of democracy and a market economy and better socialprotection of the working people.   Delegates to the party congress in Moscow urged miners ``to showrestraint during this difficult period of time, to considerseriously contemporary problems and to realize that the policy ofpressure and of ultimatums can lead to disarray in the economy,have a negative effect on perestroika and erode living standards.''</TEXT></DOC>
