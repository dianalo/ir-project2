L. No.100-418, 102 Stat. 1182), the United States Trade Representative initiatedan investigation under section 302 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended,regarding those acts, policies and practices of the Government of Japan,and of entities owned, financed, or otheriwse controlled by the Governmentof Japan, that are barriers in Japan to the offering or performance inJapan by United States persons of architectural, engineering, and constructionservices, and related consulting services. By<T4> Federal Register</T4> notice dated November 28, 1988 (53 FR 47897),USTR invited written public comment on these barriers. In addition, onMarch 13, 1989, USTR held a public hearing on the Japanese government practicesat issue (54 FR 6349), and heard testimony on practices which interestedpersons considered are unreasonable and a burden or restriction on U.S.commerce. Following the hearing, the United States held consultations withthe Government of Japan on this matter. Section 304 of the Trade Act required the USTR in this case to determineby November 21, 1989, whether the Japanese practices are unreasonable andburden or restrict U.S. commerce, and if so, what action, if any, to takeunder section 301 in response. On November 1, 1989 (54 FR 46181), USTRrequested further comment, particularly with respect to the determinationsrequired under section 304.<ITAG tagnum="84">Determinations </ITAG>On November 21, 1989, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) determinedpursuant to section 304(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (``theTrade Act''), that certain acts, policies and practices of the Governmentof Japan with respect to the procurement of architectural, engineeringand construction services and related consulting services by the JapaneseGovernment are unreasonable and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. The USTR further determined, pursuant to section 304(a)(1)(B) of the TradeAct, that no responsive action under section 301 of the Act is appropriateat this time in light of (a) written commitments made by the Governmentof Japan regarding actions the Government of Japan intends to take to improveaccess for U.S. firms to its market, and (b) written commitments made bythe Government of Japan to ongoing bilateral consultations on all unresolvedmatters regarding access to the construction market, including consultationsscheduled for spring 1990 in the context of a review of the Major ProjectsArrangements concluded by the Governments of Japan and the United Statesin May 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reasons for Determinations </ITAG>The USTR gave the following reasons for her determinations under section304 of the Trade Act:(1) Japanese Acts, Policies and PracticesOn the basis of an investigation pursuant to section 302 of the Trade Actof 1974, as amended, and on consultations with the Government of Japanand the affected U.S. industry, the USTR found it unreasonable, and a burdenor restriction on U.S. commerce, that the Government of Japan implementsprocurement policies in the construction sector in a way that limits competitionand facilitates collusive bidding practices (``dango''), including inadequateuse of administrative measures restricting collusive bidding activities,and operation of the designated bidder system. More specifically:andbullet; Japan'a administrative measures restricting collusive bidding(``dango'') are ineffective to deter collusive activities. Ministries haveconsistently imposed the minimum penalties prescribed by their regulationsto suspend from bidding firms found to have engaged in collusive activities.In two recent cases, the funding ministries suspended the guilty firmsfrom bidding from only one month and only in the region where the collusionoccurred. andbullet; The Government of Japan also implements the designated biddersystem in a way which limits competition. This system operates to limitthe number of firms that can bid, thereby further limiting the opportunitiesfor U.S. firms. The decision to designate bidders also depends on vagueand subjective criteria.In addition, the USTR found it unreasonable, and a burden or restrictionon U.S. commerce, that the Government of Japan uses open bidding proceduresonly in the 14 construction projects covered by the Major Projects Arrangementsconcluded by the United States and Japan in May 1988. More specifically:andbullet; Foreign firms are excluded from bidding on public projects outsidethe Major Projects Arrangements, unless they have had prior experienceon other Japanese construction projects. Such experience currently canbe gained only from projects subject to the Major Projects Arrangements_orfrom private sector projects, in which foreign firms have had limited success.andbullet; The Government of Japan discriminates against non-Japanese firmsby providing information to them less promptly and fully than it does toJapanese firms on projects not covered by the Major Projects Arrangements.(2) U.S. Action The USTR's determination that no responsive action under section 301 ofthe Trade Act is appropriate at this time takes into account several commitmentsmade by the Government of Japan. In consultations with the Government ofJapan on November 8-9, 1989, Japanese Government officials gave the UnitedStates written commitments, amplified by the USTR's subsequent discussionswith Japanese Government officials in Tokyo and by a letter dated November17, 1989, from the Minister of Construction, regarding actions the Governmentof Japan intends to take immediately to improve access for U.S. firms toits market. The Government of Japan also committed in the November 17 letter,and again subsequent thereto, to ongoing bilateral consultations on allunresolved matters regarding access to the construction market, includingthose scheduled for spring 1990 in the context of a review of the MajorProjects Arrangements concluded by the Governments of Japan and the UnitedStates in May 1988. More specifically: andbullet; With regard to deterrence of collusive activities, the Governmentof Japan stated its intention to undertake two new administrative measuresto deter collusive activities. It plans to provide at two stages in thebidding process a statement of the legal prohibitions against collusiveactivities. Commissioning entities will require each bidder to submit,at the time that he submits a bid, a signed and sealed document that statescompliance with the bidding instructions. andbullet; With regard to the designated bidder system, the Government ofJapan agreed to provide greater detail about the nature of the specificprojects being tendered, which should enable potential bidders to assessmore accurately whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the companyhas the technical capabilities required for designation. andbullet; With regard to requirements to form consortia or joint venturesin order to bid, the Government of Japan agreed that commissioning entitieswill refrain from determining the share of any company in a joint ventureor the segment of the project that a company will undertake. andbullet; With regard to architectural design, the Government of Japan statedthat the design of the two additional elements of the Kansai InternationalAirport will be open to non-discriminatory competition: the airline terminalannex, and the cargo terminal building. After the procuring agencies forthe Haneda Airport Terminal Construction (Phase III), the Hiroshima AirportTerminal Construction, and the New Kitakyushu Airport Terminal Constructionare determined, the Government of Japan will encourage those procuringagencies to follow non-discriminatory competitive procedures. For all otherprojects under the Major Projects Arrangements, the decision to contractfor the design will be announced in the annual plans of the commissioningauthority. andbullet; With regard to sub-contracting of goods and services, the procuringentities will publish a notice of the intention to procure all major goodsand services (whether procured directly or indirectly) at the same timethey announce the major project and will provide additional informationon those goods and services during the explanation meeting. The Governmentof Japan also stated that commissioning entities will encourage contractorsto provide explanations to a potential supplier who requests an explanation.Furthermore, the Government of Japan will allow the potential suppliersrecourse to the complaints mechanism under the Major Projects Arrangements,if the supplier fails to win the contract or subcontract and does not obtaina satisfactory explanation from the general contractor or subcontractor.The United States will monitor Japan's implementation of these market-openingactions pursuant to section 306 of the Trade Act, and will seek a satisfactoryresolution of all remaining concerns in ongoing bilateral negotiations,beginning January 19, 1990 and including a full review of the Major ProjectsArrangements in May 1990. If Japan's implementation of its undertakingsor our progress in ongoing negotiations is unsatisfactory, the USTR shallconsider at that time what further action may be appropriate under section301 of the Trade Act. The USTR's determination also takes into account the fact that the valueof U.S. architectural, engineering and construction contracts in the Japanesemarket has reached about $65 million and has been growing. The USTR willcontinue to monitor this progress and expects U.S. firms to be more successfulas Japan implements its assurances to continue its market-opening efforts.<ITAG tagnum="6">A.
