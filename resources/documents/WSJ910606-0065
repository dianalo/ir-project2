They may also be unproductive.   A recent survey by consultants Wyatt Co. indicates thatwhatever companies say publicly about the success of theirrestructuring programs, privately they are far less positive.The survey covered 1,005 companies employing more than fourmillion people and focused on the past five years. It showedthat fewer than half of companies that said their goals inrestructuring were to cut costs actually met theirexpense-reduction target; only 32% improved profitability totheir satisfaction, while 21% met their expectations forimproving return on investment.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Lots of bullets were fired, but few hit the targets,&quot;says John Parkington, director of the organization researchand development practice at Wyatt. &quot;Some companies are doingit three, four and five times, but they still don't hit theirexpense-reduction targets. Something is wrong.&quot;   Nonetheless, the study also suggests -- in common withother predictions on the subject -- that downsizing is farfrom over. More than half those surveyed by Wyatt expectcorporate restructuring to increase or maintain its presentlevel; only 8% see restructuring activity declining. Thesurvey studied three types of restructuring: mergers andacquisitions, reorganizations, and downsizing, of whichdownsizing was the most prevalent.   Many companies are being forced into successive rounds ofdownsizing, not necessarily because the first one wasn'teffective, but because their difficulties proved moreintractable than they expected. In the computer industry, forexample, watching companies' successive cost-cutting moves islike watching &quot;a Marcel Marceau pantomime. They're walkinginto the wind, only the wind keeps getting tougher andtougher,&quot; says Daniel Mandresh, an analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp;Co.   Recently, computer companies like Digital Equipment Corp.,International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.have all announced additional rounds of cutbacks.   Many consultants assert that although the currentrecession increases the likelihood that companies will cutstaff, it decreases the likelihood that they will besatisfied with the results. Jewell Westerman, a consultantwith Temple, Barker andamp; Sloane/Strategic Planning Associates,says that the past decade of cutbacks led many companies totry to become more efficient and not just cut out people.&quot;They were taking a longer-term approach,&quot; he says. Withcompanies now under economic pressure, he adds, &quot;we areseeing a reversion back to trying to get big hits.&quot;   Hewlett-Packard says its early-retirement program that wasaccepted by nearly 800 people last year was more difficultthan one it did back in 1986 under more relaxedcircumstances. In 1986, the company decided what businessesit was going to leave and what work it would eliminate andthen offered people early-retirement and severance packages.&quot;In 1986, {the cutback program} was focused,&quot; says ThomasPierson, manager of human-resource planning atHewlett-Packard. &quot;Now it's far more difficult because it isexpense-driven. Consciously deciding to eliminate work andthen dealing with the people is easier.&quot;   Part of the reason for companies' dissatisfaction withtheir restructuring, Mr. Parkington of Wyatt suggests, isthat most companies didn't even do what Hewlett-Packard saysit did in 1986. Of surveyed companies, he says, &quot;86%downsized, but only 42% of them took steps to eliminatelow-value work.&quot; That type of cutback puts the organizationunder such pressure, he says, that as soon as financialresults improve, people come pouring back into theorganization.   Although American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. dropped100,000 employees -- to 273,000 this year from 373,000 in1984 -- it continues to wrestle with pressures to add staff.&quot;The bureaucrats know how to put people back on the payroll,&quot;says ATandamp;T spokesman Burke Stinson. &quot;It's ironic to see thatmanagers will hire back people who actually do the work inorder for full-time people to attend meetings.&quot;   Of the surveyed companies that downsized, Mr. Parkingtonsays, 83% ended up replacing some of the people theydismissed; 25% of the companies replaced more than 10% ofthose who had left. Some went much further. Chrysler Corp.,for one, having effected painful cutbacks in the early 1980s,found that its staffing levels ballooned during therelatively good times that followed to levels even higherthan they had been before. &quot;We allowed ourselves to get fat,&quot;a Chrysler spokesman said early last year, as the companyannounced the first of two programs to reduce thewhite-collar staff again.   One effect of layoffs and restructuring is &quot;a severeadverse impact&quot; on the morale of remaining employees, saysMr. Parkington. Among surveyed companies, 58% said employeemorale was hurt, and 37% said employee retention was mademore difficult. What's more, nearly 80% of respondents saidthat when they offered employees early-retirement options,they lost good performers.   Many companies also find that some costs continue -- oreven increase -- despite a shrinking work force. One study ofthe retailing industry by search firm Thorndike DelandAssociates found that although major U.S. retailersrestructured and cut staff since 1986, their overhead costsdidn't drop. The median administrative expense for the 20companies studied was 22.8% in 1986 and 22.9% in 1989. Whilethe retailers cut staff, the search firm notes, they failedto cut spending on such things as travel.   Some consultants say a systematic examination of what thecompany does and how it does it should precede any thoughtsof downsizing or layoffs; only after the work is redesignedmore efficiently should the staff size be looked at. In somecases, the staff size won't even matter.   &quot;What I march to is reduced operating expenses,&quot; saysJames R. Bryant, vice president, shared services, at BaxterInternational Inc. &quot;I am not monitored on headcount. I ammonitored on operating costs.&quot; While the centralizing offunctions he has been involved in has resulted in some staffcuts, he says that wasn't his goal. &quot;If I can make costs goaway by adding a person, I am going to add someone.&quot;   The problem, says Robert Gunn, of consulting company Gunn,Hackett andamp; Markos, is that such an evaluation &quot;sounds great,it seems simple, and it takes six years&quot; and the cooperationof the entire organization to accomplish.   Facing a complete redesign of the organization, he says,&quot;management gets frustrated and says, `we are going todownsize by 10% -- every function, everywhere.'&quot; But Mr. Gunnlikens the cuts to fad diets: &quot;They work instantaneously, butyou didn't really change your eating habits. You just stoppedeating.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
