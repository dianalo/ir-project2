The North Carolina storm produced lightning fires and toppledpower lines, leaving one-third of the city of Greensborotemporarily in darkness, authorities said.   Two falling trees fatally injured 8-year-old Tim Marshall whilehe was riding his bicycle to his Greensboro home about 6:45 p.m.,Police Sgt. Joe Deich said.   ``It was just the worst possible timing,'' said John Langerman,a witness. ``He was riding pretty fast, and if he had been twoseconds faster or two seconds slower, nothing would have happened.''   Lightning struck and killed Terry Lynn Knox, 38, of Mooresvilleabout 6:30 p.m. as he was headed for shore in a pontoon boat onLake Norman, north of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County Police said.   About 7:30 p.m., the National Weather Service reported a solidline of thunderstorms that stretched across northern North Carolinafrom Elizabeth City across the Virginia border north of RockyMount, and southwest across the northeast Piedmont north of Raleighto the northwest Piedmont south of Greensboro. The storms weremoving at about 30 mph, but winds were reported as high as 55 mph.   In southeast Alabama, two homes were destroyed by what witnessesdescribed as a tornado and dozens of vehicles were damaged whenwinds ripped part of the roof off the Dothan airport.   Thunderstorms across Colorado triggered heavy rains in someareas, a tornado in open country in Adams County east of Denver,and winds that blew windows out of a home near Franktown.   One strong thunderstorm dropped 1.1 inches of rain and pea-sizedhail in 35 minutes south of Centennial Airport in Arapahoe County.That cloudburst caused local street flooding.   Severe thunderstorms in Kansas spawned at least one tornado inthe south-central part of the state, the National Weather Servicesaid.   A tornado touched down about 8 p.m. in a rural area just northof Partridge, said Joanne Angell, a supervisor with the Reno CountySheriff's Department. No damage or injuries were reported.   A cluster of heavy thunderstorms also rumbled northwestwardacross the Red River from northern Texas into southwesternOklahoma, said Gary Szatkowski, a National Weather Serviceforecaster.   Szatkowski said the storms produced rainfall of up to an inch,but not enough to ease drought conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
