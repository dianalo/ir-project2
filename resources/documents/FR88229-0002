The Appliance Labeling Rule was subsequentlyamended on December 10, 1987 (52 FR 46888) to add a new category of appliancesto the Rule_central air conditioners (which includes heat pumps). As aresult, the rule requires the disclosure of energy efficiency or cost informationon labels and in retail sales catalogs for eight categories of appliances,and mandates that these energy costs or energy efficiency ratings be basedon standardized test procedures developed by DOE. The rule also requiresa general disclosure, on certain point-of-sale promotional materials, ofthe availability of energy cost or energy efficiency information, and requiresthat any claims concerning energy consumption made in writing or in broadcastadvertisements be based on results of the standardized test procedures.The cost and efficiency information obtained by following the test proceduresis derived by using the representative average unit energy costs providedby DOE. Table 1 in andSection;305.9 of the rule sets forth the representativeaverage unit energy costs to be used for all requirements of the rule.As stated in andSection;305.9(b), the Table is intended to be revised periodicallyon the basis of updated information provided by DOE. Table 1 was firstrevised by publication of new DOE figures on January 13, 1981 in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (46 FR 2974).On December 23, 1987, DOE published (52 FR 48563) the most recent figuresfor representative average unit energy costs. Consequently, Table 1 isbeing updated to reflect these latest cost figures. Accordingly, Table1 is revised to read as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Mandatory Use of Revised Cost Figures</ITAG>The dates when use of the figures in the Revised Table 1 becomes mandatoryin calculating cost disclosures for use in reporting, labeling and advertisingproducts covered by the Commission's rule and/or EPCA are as follows:<T3>For 1988 Submissions of Data Under andSection;305.8 of the Commission'sRule:</T3> The new cost figures must be used in all 1988 submissions.<T3>For Labeling and Advertising of Products Under the Commission's Rule:</T3>Based on 1988 submissions using the 1988 DOE cost figures, the staff willdetermine whether to publish new ranges. Any products for which new rangesare published must be labeled with estimated annual cost figures calculatedusing the 1988 DOE cost figures. If such new ranges are published, theeffective date for labeling new products will be ninety days after publicationof the ranges in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Products that have been labeled prior to theeffective date of any range modification need not be relabeled. Advertisingfor such products will also have to be based on the new costs and rangesbeginning ninety days after publication of the new ranges in the <T3>Register.</T3><T3>Advertising of Products Covered by EPCA but not by the Commission'sRule:</T3> Manufacturers of products covered by section 323(c) of EPCA,but not by the Appliance Labeling Rule (clothes dryers, television sets,kitchen ranges and ovens, humidifiers and dehumidifiers, and space heaters)must use the 1988 representative average unit costs for energy in all representativeseffective May 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 305</ITAG>Advertising, Energy conservation, Household appliances, Labeling, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 305_[AMENDED]</ITAG>Accordingly, 16 CFR Part 305 is amended as follows:1.
