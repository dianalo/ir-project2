The Coast Guard rescued six people who endured two days of windand rain on an island after high seas prevented them from returningto the mainland.   There was virtually no damage in southern Louisiana except forsome spot flooding and tree limbs blown down. Scattered damage wasreported in southern Mississippi, including downed tree limbs andscattered power outages.   In New Orleans, where preparations continued for next week'sRepublican National Convention, few problems developed from thestorm.   ``The beneficial aspects of this tropical storm are probablymuch greater than any negative effects from this system _ andthat's rain,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National HurricaneCenter in Coral Gables, Fla.   Shortly before 5 p.m. CDT, forecasters downgraded the storm to atropical depression as its highest sustained wind speed dropped to35 mph; a storm is designated a tropical storm when wind speed hits39 mph.   The storm's center was just west-southwest of Baton Rouge by9:30 p.m., and was expected to continue moving slowly northwest,the National Weather Service said.   Seas of 7 to 10 feet were expected to drop behind the storm,forecasters said. Although the storm was not producing widespreadrain, there was a danger of flooding from locally heavy storms, theweather service said.   Flooding was reported in Mississippi in low areas and alongoverflowing rivers and streams. About 150 people in Harrison Countywere forced to move to higher ground Tuesday because of riverflooding, said Linda Rouse, deputy director for Harrison CountyCivil Defense. ``We have people on all of the rivers'' monitoringthe levels.   Beryl, the Atlantic storm season's second named tropical storm,still had the potential of moving back over the Gulf, where itwould gain strength from the warm water, but forecasters said thatwas unlikely.   ``We think it's going to go on a more west track, westnorthwest, then turn toward the northwest up over the Midwestarea,'' Sheets said. ``We don't think it's going to go back outover the water so there's not much chance of it ever strengtheningagain.''   Thousands of workers from the marshes and offshore oil rigs wereevacuated Monday as a precaution, and tourists abandoned theMississippi and Alabama coasts.   The Coast Guard suspended a search Tuesday for a 15-year-old boywho fell overboard when a 24-foot fishing boat capsized nearDauphin Island off the coast of Alabama.   The youth, whose name was not given, was reported missingTuesday by a survivor found clinging to the hull of a vessel thatcapsized Monday in the Mississippi Sound. Searchers believe theboat was swamped by seven-foot waves.   Although Beryl barely bruised Alabama's coastline, 11.6 inchesof rain was reported at Dauphin Island for the 24-hour periodending at 7 a.m. Tuesday.   The Coast Guard rescued six people who went camping Sunday onPetit Bois Island, south of Pasagoula, Miss., when the forecast wasfor mostly sunny weather. That night, the weather turned bad andthe water became too choppy to travel back to the mainland.   ``We lost one of the tents,'' Mrs. Randy Gibson said. ``Wepatched the other with garbage bags and anything else we couldfind. We exhausted everything we had.''   ``We haven't slept since Sunday,'' she said after being rescuedTuesday. ``We haven't been dry since then.''   Homes were evacuated east of New Orleans in the St. BernardParish fishing villages of Hopedale, Yscloskey and Shell Beach.   In Lafourche Parish, authorities readied eight evacuationcenters Monday, but seven of the centers remained closed Tuesday,the eighth was unoccupied and parish officials said they expectedfew problems with the storm.</TEXT></DOC>
