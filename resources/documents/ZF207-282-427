 Version 2.0 includes color, an objectlibrary and a full-featured desk accessory.andP;  While Silicon Beach Software'sSuperPaint pioneered the idea of combining draw and paint capabilities in oneapplication, Canvas 2.0 takes the concept a good deal further.andM;Better drawing.andP;  In Canvas, there are no special draw and paint layers toflip between.andP;  Instead, you create and manipulate draw objects and specialpaint objects, overlaying the two are required.andM;Layers are used for convenience only, and Canvas lets you separate elementsof a drawing on as many different layers as memory allows.andP;  Layers can beviewed individually, together and in combination with one or more layersgrayed out.andM;Canvas 2.0 is loaded with drawing tools and tool enhancers that go beyondthose of its more expensive object-oriented rival, MacDraw II from Claris ofCupertino, Calif.andP;  Canvas is superior in color handling, thecomprehensiveness of its drawing environment, support for a variety of fileformats and its neat object library feature.andP;  The DA version is another plus.andM;Whereas MacDraw II only supports an eight-color palette (including black andwhite), Canvas provides access to 16.7 million colors.andP;  Deneba claims thatCanvas will take advantage of 24- or 32-bit color video boards, but we didnot test this capability.andM;A set of pre-defined color palettes is supplied, or you can create your own.andO;Among other things, you can add or subtract red, green and blue values;create color blends; and choose one of the millions of colors from the ColorPicker.andP;  Custom palettes can be saved and recalled later for use with anydocument.andM;All draw applications allow you to create geometric shapes, such asrectangles, circles and polygons.andP;  But they differ in how accurately you canposition such objects.andP;  Canvas can position objects extremely accurately --down to one sixty-four-thousandth of an inch.andP;  This compares well to the onetwo-thousandth of an inch precision offered by MacDraw II and is a boon totechnical illustrators and others with low-range drafting needs.andM;Precise positioning is handled by the so-called Object Manager.andP;  While anobject appears on screen as a definite shape you can point at, the ObjectManager represents the same object as a set of vital statistics.andM;Take a circle, for example.andP;  In the OBject Manager, the circle is representedby its object type, fill pattern, pen pattern, back and fore colors, penshape, coordinate position, unit dimensions, area, and perimeter length.andP;  Youcan alter any of these settings by merely typing in a new specification, andCanvas will redraw the object accordingly.andM;Specific to draw objects is the &quot;convert to bit map&quot; option that allowsselected draw objects to be recreated as bit maps in one of seven resolutionsfrom 72 dpi to 2,540 dpi.andP;  This capability provides a flexible way to match avariety of output device resolutions.andM;Painting features.andP;  Ever since MacPaint broke the Etch-a-Sketch barrier,graphics software developers have been eager to see what more they can get amouse to do.andP;  Deneba obviously didn't get caught up in this rush, sinceCanvas' paint tools are almost MacPaint-like, with high resolution added.andO;It's best to consider the paint environment as offering simply the ability toedit scanned images and to touch up the geometric harshness of draw objects.andO;Nevertheless some subtle paint features are worth delving into.andM;Special to Canvas 2.0, and only usable by Mac II owners, is the bit-mapconversion option.andP;  This is used to massage so-called Picture Objects(scanned color or gray-scale images that are pasted into a drawing) so thatthey appear as halftone or dithered images when printed.andP;  Basically, Canvasattempts to convert the image from a simple array of dots into clusters ofdots that simulate the halftoning capabilities of commercial printingequipment.andP;  Of course, the quality of the resulting printout depends on thequality of the original image and the type of halftoning algorithm employed.andO;There are 15 conversion options with which to experiment.andM;Probably the most novel Canvas feature is the object macro menu.andP;  Once youhave taken the pains to create a complicated object, you can select it, nameit and add it to the macro menu.andP;  Choosing an image from the menu andclicking anywhere on the drawing area will instantly paste in a copy of theobject.andP;  Up to 32 objects can be added to the macro menu, and macro sets canbe saved.andM;Undocumented features.andP;  While working with Canvas 2.0, we found no majorproblems.andP;  In fact, we found a new undocumented (and therefore not fullysupported) features that you should take a look at.andM;Although the documentation indicates that you can only magnify an object upto 32 times, you can go higher.andP;  Draw an object, use the palette option toenlarge it 32 times and then click on this already immense object with themagnifying tool.andP;  You will find that you have a fully editable object 64times the original size.andP;  Apparently, it is quite safe to edit Bezier curvesand polygons at this level, although Deneba said that some problems may occurwith bit-mapped objects.andM;Another nice but undocumented feature is that Canvas supports tear-offpalettes.andP;  If you press the space bar while dragging any of the pop-uppalettes (color, patterns and lines), the palette will detach.andP;  The onlylimitation is that the free-floating palette will be placed behind thecurrently open window instead of on top, as is standard.andP;  However, you resizethe window or, if you have a large monitor, drag it to some visible location.andM;File compatibility.andP;  If any graphics application is going to do well, itneeds to be able to handle a variety of file formats.andP;  While canvas uses itsown proprietary file format for saving documents, it covers a lot of otherterritory as well.andP;  You can open MacPaint and MacDraw.andP;  1.X files directly,as well as images saved in TIFF, PICT and PICT2 formats.andP;  Files can be savedas MacPaint, TIFF, PICT or PICT2.andM;Documentation and technical support.andP;  The Version 2.0 upgrade was sent freeto registered owners of the original Canvas, indicating Deneba's commitmentto its customers.andP;  The program is attratively packaged with a grimmickywooden &quot;easel&quot; that holds the manual.andP;  The manuals are complete and easy toread with many appropriate illustrations.andP;  The technical support wasknowledgeable and forthcoming as well as toll-free.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Canvas 2.0 is an excellent allround graphics package, and theDA makes it particularly useful for desktop publishing work since it can openany paint.andP;  TIFF or PICT file.andP;  While canvas 2.0 is exerting pressure on itscompetition, Deneba is not standing still: IT is adding extensions to theapplication.andP;  Expect to see the ability to create curved text (text arrangedon a curved baseline) and a dashed line editor in the next few months.andP;  Suchcontinued attention can only make a very good draw package that much better.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
