As Geraldine Brooksnotes in her page-one story &quot;Veiled Capitalists: The NewRevolution in Iran Is Taking Place on an Economic Front&quot;(Sept. 16), Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani is adroitlymaneuvering Tehran's fundamentalist regime toward a moremoderate, freer-market economy. However, the U.S. continuesto ignore the realities of Iran's historical strategicprominence in the region by opposing any dialogue or commercewith the country's emerging post-revolutionary regime. Thisis a major policy blunder.   Washington cautiously should encourage private investmentand facilitate Iran's edging toward an economic reversal offortune. The gain in political stability would provide a muchneeded foundation for the Middle East peace process.</LP><TEXT>   Ms. Brooks catalogs a number of recent steps evidencingMr. Rafsanjani's moderating tilt, citing specific post-GulfWar actions, such as diplomatic missions to Arab neighborsand pressure on radical Shiite groups holding Westernhostages in Lebanon. She neglects to mention Iran'scontinuing adherence to the arbitral process established inThe Hague to resolve U.S. claims arising out of therevolution and the hostage crisis.   For a decade Iran has participated patiently in thelargest, most complex and ultimately successful internationalclaims-resolution process in history. More than 3,000 claimshave been adjudicated or settled and almost $2 billion inIranian funds have been paid to successful Americanclaimants. Taken together with other indicia of moderation,Iran's continuing participation in The Hague process, inspite of the fact that it lost more than 90% of the cases,speaks volumes about Iran's intention -- and ability -- toplay a constructive role in the new order being forged inEurope and the Middle East. The U.S. should be prepared totake full advantage of this opportunity-and reach out againto a former ally.   C.
