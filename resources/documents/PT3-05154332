When used with      equipment that provides a harness for carrying the equipment on a user's      back, this enclosure provides a number of features relating to the      transportation, storage and usage of the equipment. When used as an      enclosure for a backpack, the backpack is inserted into the enclosure and      the contents are transported by means of a handle or shoulder strap in a      manner similar to a duffel bag. Whenever the backpack must be left      unattended for any period of time, a padlock can be used to interconnect      the zippers to prevent the zippers from being unzipped. For additional      security, a metal cable can be used to secure the invention and enclosed      backpack to an an immobile object. This feature allows the traveler to      leave the backpack unattended for short periods of time without the fear      of theft of the contents or the backpack itself. Furthermore, the      orientation of the zippers allows the backpack to be worn by the user      while the backpack is inside the enclosure. A removable flap of material      provides a passageway for the shoulder straps of the backpack to pass      through the enclosure and to be worn by the user, allowing the enclosure      to serve as an all-purpose protective cover from the elements of weather. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to equipment that is carried on a user's back by      means of a harness. Outdoor sporting gear, and in particular backpacks are      examples of this type of equipment. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND </PAC><PAR>  As a result of the increasing interest in the environment, more and more      individuals are exploring the wilderness. While some of these individuals      are content to explore their own backyards, others journey into more      remote regions of the world. These journeys can range from a few weeks to      many months in duration. </PAR><PAR>  Heretofore, individuals traveling on these journeys encountered a number of      logistical problems relating to their backpacks. For the typical journey,      these backpackers must travel a long distance to get to where they begin      their expedition (called the point of embarkation), and getting their      backpacks to this point was difficult. Many transportation agencies      (airline, train, bus, etc.) do not allow backpacks to be checked as      baggage and those few that check backpacks do not guarantee the condition      of the backpacks upon arrival at the destination. Some people use large      duffel bags to solve this problem but encounter another problem upon      arrival: the empty duffel bag. Once unpacked, they could carry the duffel      bag with them which would be extra weight, throw the duffel bag away which      would be wasteful, or give the duffel bag to someone to hold for the      return trip which would be unlikely. </PAR><PAR>  Another problem encountered by many backpackers is that they must keep      their backpacks with them at all times. To leave them unattended for a few      moments can result in the theft of the contents or the backpack itself.      They must carry their backpacks into restaurants, museums, grocery stores,      guided tours, etc. Though some travelers will put their backpacks in      public lockers, lock them in hotel rooms, or leave them with a friend,      these options are not always available. </PAR><PAR>  Finally, for persons traveling in inclement weather or in rugged terrain,      some means to protect the backpack and the gear inside the backpack from      rain, snow, mud, etc. is desirable. Rain shells for backpacks provide this      function but the extra weight is only justified when the weather is poor. </PAR><PAC>  OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, several objects and advantages result from this invention when      used with back-carried equipment. An object of this invention is to      provide a means for transporting such equipment as baggage. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of this invention is to provide a means for reasonably      securing such equipment and its contents when it is necessary to leave the      equipment unattended. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of this invention is to provide a means for protecting      such equipment from the elements of weather and terrain when the equipment      is in use. </PAR><PAR>  Given the preferred embodiment as backpack enclosure, the following      paragraphs highlight the advantages of the invention. Relating to the      initial object, the invention functions in a manner similar to a duffel      bag: the enclosure is unzipped, the backpack is inserted into the      enclosure, the zippers are closed, and the enclosure and contents are      transported by means of a handle. </PAR><PAR>  Whenever the backpack must be left unattended for any period of time, a      common padlock can be used to interconnect the zippers to prevent the      zippers from being unzipped. For additional security, a metal cable can be      used to secure the invention and enclosed backpack to an an immobile      object. This feature allows the traveler to leave the backpack unattended      for short periods of time without the fear of theft of the contents or the      backpack itself. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, the orientation of the zippers allows the backpack to be worn      by the user while the backpack is inside the enclosure. A removable flap      of material provides a passageway for the shoulder straps of the backpack      to pass through the invention and to be worn by the user. </PAR><PAR>  This feature provides two primary advantages over duffel bags. First, since      the user travels with the backpack inside the invention, it allows the      user to quickly and conveniently take off and reasonably secure the      backpack. On the other hand, if a duffel bag were to be used to secure the      backpack, the tedious process would involve taking off the backpack,      locating the duffel bag somewhere inside the backpack, unzipping the      duffel bag, inserting the backpack into the duffel bag, zipping closed the      duffel bag and finally securing the duffel bag. In addition, the ability      of a user to carry their backpack enclosed within the invention allows the      invention to serve as an all-purpose protective cover from the elements of      weather. Though common rain shells for backpacks provide this protective      feature, they are limited in providing only this function. </PAR><PAR>  Further objects and advantages of our invention will become apparent and      will be more readily understood from a consideration of the attached      drawings, taken together with the ensuing description of our invention. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective of the front side of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a plan view of a zipper. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a detail of the invention with the zippers closed and      interlocked. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a perspective of the invention lashed to the backpack. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a plan view of a user carrying a backpack with the enclosure in      place. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is an alternative embodiment of the invention with two zippers and      an annular device. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is an alternative embodiment of the invention in a cylindrical      enclosure </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is an alternative embodiment of the invention with zippers in an      inverted V configuration. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is an alternative embodiment with protective flaps over the closure      devices, a shoulder strap, and interior and exterior storage compartments. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  LIST OF REFERENCE NUMERALS IN DRAWINGS </PAC><TBL>  ______________________________________                                         10-  detachable connector device                                                                      12-    handle                                           14a- zipper a          14b-   zipper b                                         14c- zipper c          16-    invention/enclosure                              18-  handle strap      20-    support strap                                    22-  tab               24-    slider/tab assembly                              26-  front panel       28-    back panel                                       30-  bottom panel      32-    top panel                                        34a- side panel a      34b-   side panel b                                     36-  zipper            38-    termination point of                                                           zipper                                           40-  origin point zipper                                                                              42-    flap of material                                 44-  cloth tie         46-    shackle                                          48-  padlock           50-    apparatus                                        52-  shoulder strap of backpack                                                                       54-    backpack frame                                   56-  weather flap      58-    backpack                                         60-  shoulder strap for enclosure                                                                     62-    hole in tab                                      64-  interior storage compartment                                                                     66-    exterior storage                                                               compartment                                      ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The preferred embodiment of the invention as illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 1      is a substantially rectangular fabric enclosure 16, for which there is a      front panel 26, a back panel 28, two narrower side panels 34a and 34b, a      top panel 32 and a bottom panel 30, each of which is connected along its      mutually coincident edge by stitching, energy sealing or like means. In      addition, the enclosure has three closure devices 14a, 14b, and 14c, and      an attached handle 12. The closure devices are closed in order to join the      split portions of the edge panels and thereby prevent the contents of the      enclosure from passing out of the enclosure. </PAR><PAR>  This embodiment of invention 16 uses zippers as the preferred closure      devices. Referencing FIG. 2, the location of a slider/tab assembly 24      along a zipper 36 determines whether zipper 36 is opened or closed. When      slider 24 is at an origin point 40, zipper 36 is open (or unzipped). When      slider 24 is at a termination point 38, the zipper 36 is closed (or      zipped). A tab 22 of slider 24 is constructed in such a way as to provide      a hole 62 in tab 22 of sufficient diameter to allow an interlocking means,      such as a shackle 46 of a padlock 48, to pass thru all tabs 22, as      depicted in FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 3, zipper pair 14a and 14b are parallel to each other and      are on back panel 28. There is a flap of material 42 between them that is      secured to enclosure 16 at the intersection of back panel 28 and bottom      panel 30. Zipper pair 14a and 14b are spaced apart at such a distance as      to allow the harness, in this case a shoulder strap 52 of a backpack 58,      to pass through invention 16 unencumbered when flap 42 is secured out of      the way. </PAR><PAR>  Again referencing FIG. 2, sliders 24 of zippers 14a and 14b are at origin      point 40 when the respective slider 24 is at the intersection of bottom      panel 30 and back panel 28. Third zipper 14c originates on front panel 26,      travels over top panel 32, and terminates between but just above      termination point 38 of zippers 14a and 14b on back panel 28. Therefore,      when all three zippers 14a, 14b, and 14c are closed, sliders 24 of each      zipper 14a, 14b, and 14c are in close proximity of each other, as      illustrated in FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  If one or more zippers 36 used in construction of the invention does not      provide an adequate weather barrier for backpack 58, then a means of      providing such an adequate barrier can be used. One possible solution is      to add a additional piece of material 56 along closure device as shown in      FIG. 9. Other enhancements to the invention could take the form of one or      more interior storage compartments 64, one or more exterior storage      compartments 66 or a shoulder strap 60 as illustrated in FIG. 9. </PAR><PAR>  The invention is preferably constructed of strong, durable materials which      can endure repeated exposure to the elements of weather and rough      handling. Both natural and man-made materials such as canvas and nylon are      suitable for the panel material. The handles must support substantial      weight and could be made of nylon, polypropylene, or canvas webbing. </PAR><PAC>  OPERATION OF INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The design of this invention provides three primary features for      back-carried equipment: 1) the ability to protect the equipment so that it      may be checked as baggage for transportation; 2) the ability to enclose      and reasonably secure the equipment both inside the enclosure and to an      immobile object; and 3) the ability for it to be used as a protective      shell for the equipment that is being carried on the user's back. </PAR><PAR>  To use the first feature, invention 16 is oriented as in FIG. 3 such that      back panel 28 is facing the user. Zippers 14a, 14b, and 14c are opened,      backpack 58 is placed inside such that backpack 58 is upright and a frame      54 is closest to back panel 28. All zippers are closed. Invention 16 with      enclosed backpack 58 is now placed on side panel 34b as depicted in FIG.      1. Backpack 58 can now be carried by means of handle 12 and can be checked      as baggage. </PAR><PAR>  To use the second feature, backpack 58 is inserted into the invention as in      the first feature and all zippers are closed. Zippers 14a, 14b, and 14c      can now be interlocked by Suitable means for interconnecting tabs 24 such      as running shackle 46 of padlock 48 through each hole 62 of tabs 24 of      each zipper respectively and locked as detailed in FIG. 3. The orientation      of zippers 14a, 14b, and 14c prevent zippers 14a, 14b, and 14c from being      unzipped when so interconnected. </PAR><PAR>  For additional security, backpack 58 can be locked to an immobile object by      using a cable with eyelets at each end. After interlocking zippers 14a,      14b, and 14c, the cable can be looped thru frame 54 of backpack 58 and      around an immobile object, such as a lightpost, bike rack, etc. Shackle 46      can be threaded through the eyelet at each end of the cable and the      padlock locked. This configuration has the dual effect of interconnecting      the zippers and locking the backpack to an immobile object. </PAR><PAR>  To use the third feature, backpack 58 is inserted into invention 16 as in      the first feature but only top zipper 14c is closed-zipper pair 14a and      14b remain open. Resultant flap of material 42 between zipper 14a and 14b      is capable of being rolled upon itself and secured in the rolled condition      by means of a cloth tie 44. Cloth tie 44 is located at the intersection of      back panel 28 and bottom panel 30, on the inside of enclosure 16. This      permits a user to roll up flap 42 and secure it out of the way when it is      desired to use the invention as a shell, as shown in FIG. 5. </PAR><PAR>  To lash enclosure 16 around backpack 58, each handle strap 18 at back panel      28 is disconnected from each respective support strap 20 by means of a      connector device 10, as illustrated in FIG. 4. Both shoulder straps 52 of      backpack 58 are pulled away from frame 54 and detached handle straps 18      are passed through the resultant opening between shoulder straps 52 and      backpack frame 54. Handle straps 18 are reattached to supporting straps      20. This configuration secures the enclosure to the backpack due to the      lashing effect of supporting straps 20 and allows the invention 16 to      provide a protective barrier against the elements of weather. </PAR><PAR>  An alternative embodiment of invention 16 is shown in FIG. 6. This design      uses only two zippers 14a and 14b and suitable securing means such as an      apparatus 50 located near termination points 38. When zippers 14a and 14b      are closed, an interlocking device is threaded through both tabs 22 and      apparatus 50 and locked. There are any number of apparatuses 50 that can      be located near termination point 38 in order to interlock zippers 14a and      14b. Such suitable apparatuses include rings, loops and other annular      devices, buckles, hooks and tie downs. </PAR><PAR>  Another embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 7. This design uses the same      closure device configuration as the preferred embodiment but uses a      substantially cylindrical enclosure. </PAR><PAR>  Yet another embodiment shown in FIG. 8 orients the closure devices in an      inverted V orientation. </PAR><PAR>  Still another embodiment illustrated in FIG. 9 illustrates additional      enhancements to the invention. Shown in the figure are shoulder strap 60,      protective flaps 56 for the zippers 14a, 14b and 14c, inner storage      compartment 64 and outer storage compartment 66. </PAR><PAR>  Finally, other embodiments are possible and could include panels for which      two or more panels are made from the same piece of material and therefore      not connected along each edge. A closure device could be configured in a T      orientation, with the base of the T comprises of 2 parallel closure      devices. Another configuration might consist of a single closure device in      an inverted U orientation. In addition, the connector devices 10 could be      eliminated if the two sets of handle straps 18 could be disconnected at      the handle 12. </PAR><PAC>  CONCLUSION, RAMIFICATIONS, AND SCOPE OF INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention is a multifunctional enclosure for all types of back-carried      equipment that uses a harness to support the equipment on the user's back.      It permits the user to protectively enclose such equipment inside the      invention to facilitate transportation on buses, trains, planes, etc.      Also, the invention enables the user, when such equipment must be left      unattended, to reasonably secure the equipment inside the protective      enclosure and additionally to an immobile object by an interconnecting and      interlocking means. Finally, the invention permits the invention to be      used as a protective cover while the user is carrying the equipment on the      user's back. </PAR><PAR>  Since various possible embodiments might be made of the present invention      or modifications might be set forth, it is to be understood that all of      the materials shown and described in the accompanying drawings are to be      interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
