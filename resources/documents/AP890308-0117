Opposition parties boycotted debate on the budget, bringingParliament's business to a halt, and renewed their demands thatPrime Minister Noburo Takeshita call new elections and resign so thepublic can render its verdict.   Those arrested Wednesday were Takashi Kato, a former viceminister of labor, and Masao Tatsumi, a former senior executive ofthe busiess information conglomerate Recruit Co.   Tatsumi is accused of bribing Kato in 1986 to obtain favorabletreatment of Recruit by the ministry.   Kato was among more than 150 senior bureaucrats, politicalfigures and businessmen who were offered bargain shares inRecruit-Cosmos Co., a real estate subsidiary of Recruit, before thecompany was listed.   When the shares went on public sale, their value soard and Katomade a profit estimated at about $56,000.   Prosecutors have arrested 12 people so far, but released twojunior Recruit officials Tuesday and have yet to decide whetherformal charges will be filed against them.   They say Kato, the highest-ranking public official held in thescandal, influenced a Labor Ministry decision on publishingemployment information that was to Recruit's advantage. Alower-ranking ministry official, Shigeru Kano, was arrested onbribery charges last month.   ``For Japan's civil servants, this spelled a most embarrassingscandal that discredited them all in the eyes of the public,'' theinfluential national newspaper Asahi said in an editorial.   ``We wonder if (bureaucrats) are still able to really `serve' thepublic at large. If their consciences are being clouded by bribesand so much extravagance, they are betraying the public.''   The Japanese generally have regarded senior civil servants asofficials of high integrity.   Kato's arrest came two days after that of Hisashi Shinto, 78,former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., the world'slargest company in terms of stock value.   Shinto also is being held on bribery charges in connection withalleged favorable treatment of Recruit by the gianttelecommunications utility.   Takeshita's administration has been buffeted by the scandal sincethe first reports of it last June.   Three Cabinet ministers have resigned because of links toRecruit, the governing Liberal Democratic Party has lost interimelections and a storm surrounds political and corporate ethics.   In Parliament, the boycotting Japan Socialist Party, Komeito(Clean Government), Democratic Socialist Party and Japan CommunistParty said they also would insist Takeshita's predecessor as primeminister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, appear before a committee.   Three Nakasone aides bought 29,000 Recruit-Cosmos shares in 1986but he denies involvement in the Recruit affair.   ``Without Nakasone appearing ... we cannot participate in thesession,'' said Shun Ohide of the Socialists, the main oppositiongroup.   Takeshita has coupled his refusal to resign with repeated pledgesof political reform, but polls indicate a steady decline in hispublic support.   Yomiuri, Japan's largest newspaper, released a poll last week inwhich only 21.3 percent of respondents said they supported the hisgovernment, down 6.1 points from January. The January poll was thefirst since Takeshita took office in November 1987 to show him withan approval rating below 30 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
