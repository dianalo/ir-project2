But the board said it hasn't determined whether the crackwent undiscovered because the inspection was improperly doneor the inspection method was inadequate. In any case, itcalled on the Federal Aviation Administration to developimproved inspection methods -- perhaps involving electricalcurrent -- for detecting surface cracks in the fan disks ofGeneral Electric Co.'s CF6-6 engines.</LP><TEXT>   Anthony Broderick, associate FAA administrator forcertification and regulation, said that he hadn't seen theNTSB recommendation but that agency engineers will examineit. &quot;Certainly, we can always improve our inspectiontechniques,&quot; he said. But Mr. Broderick added that hebelieves it's an open question whether the crack wasdetectable. &quot;As in many accidents, technical people coulddebate this for a long time,&quot; he said.   The safety board hasn't yet issued its final report on theJuly 19 crash of a DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa, that killed 112people on board. Investigators have already concluded that acrack resulting from a metal impurity caused the fan disk tofly apart. Shrapnel-like pieces sliced through the plane'shydraulic lines, making the plane almost uncontrollable. Theaircraft crashed during an emergency landing.   The standard procedure for detecting surface cracks iscalled a fluorescent penetrant inspection. The disk iscovered with a fluorescent liquid, then washed off, dustedwith a chemical developer and examined under fluorescentlight. Cracks typically show up as a result of absorbing andretaining the liquid.   In an inspection that took place 760 flights before theaccident, the NTSB said, United used this procedure, butdidn't discover the crack.   &quot;The safety board's investigation has revealed evidencesuggesting that, at the time of this fluorescent penetrantinspection, the crack was of a detectable size,&quot; NTSBChairman James Kolstad said in a letter to FAA AdministratorJames Busey.   But Rob Doughty, a spokesman for United, said the airlinehasn't any reason to believe that the crack was detectable atthe time of the inspection. He said he hadn't seen the NTSBletter.   After the accident, the FAA ordered ultrasonic inspectionson the engines like the ones that were on the plane thatcrashed. But the board, in its letter yesterday, said it wasconcerned that the ultrasonic inspection wouldn't detectsurface cracks. It said the FAA should develop a method usingelectrical currents, called an eddy current inspection, todetect surface cracks.   In a separate action, the board recommended that the FAAbeef up its equipment for detecting wind-shear, a sharpchange in wind speed and direction that can be extremelydangerous during aircraft takeoffs and landings.</TEXT></DOC>
