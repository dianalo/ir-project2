They favor a radical proposal to assign a government commission the task of determining the value of labor in the marketplace.    This week, the House is scheduled to again consider a bill that sets up a study comparing the wage levels in federal jobs predominantly held by women with those predominantly held by men. According to the bill's supporters, any gap in pay found after factoring out &quot;objective&quot; job criteria -- such as job complexity, knowledge needed, judgment and amount of discretion required -- could be attributed to sex discrimination and should be corrected. This study would serve as a model for private-sector job evaluations, as well as the basis for subsequent lawsuits.    Comparable-worth advocates argue that women in traditionally lower-paying &quot;women's jobs&quot; should have their pay increased to equal those of higher-paying jobs determined to be of equal worth. For example, a 1986 pay-equity (the new name for the concept after comparable worth was tarnished in the 1985 debate over the issue) study commissioned by the state of Wisconsin found that a typist's skills were worth more than those of an aircraft pilot.    Most pilots are men. Most typists are women. In the name of fairness, as proponents of comparable worth see it, employers should raise the salaries of typists; indeed, in Wisconsin, that's just what the state did.    Advocates of the comparable-worth bill introduced by Rep. Mary Rose Oakar (D., Ohio) repeat over and over, like parents soothing a frightened child, &quot;It's only a study. It's only a study.&quot; They know, however, that this legislation is but a first step toward a government-imposed wage structure.    The private-sector implications are obvious. If it is discriminatory for the federal government to pay a female typist less than a male pilot, isn't it true for American Airlines as well? And wouldn't it be up to the federal government to ensure that such discriminatory pay practices are rectified?    House opponents of comparable worth garnered enough votes on a similar bill in 1985 to uphold a promised presidential veto. In a presidential election year when Democrats hope to exploit a perceived &quot;gender gap,&quot; the political merits may be enough to resuscitate the bill. In 1984, the bill passed the House with only six votes against it, but a companion measure was kept bottled up under Republican control of the Senate. The Senate has yet to vote on comparable worth, but Sen. Daniel Evans (R., Wash.) plans to offer the legislation as an amendment to the pending minimum-wage bill.    Any implementation of a comparable-worth plan would not so much pit women against men as blue-collar workers against white-collar workers. Most comparable-worth studies favor white-collar occupations over blue-collar occupations, assessing points for degrees and credentials while ignoring such factors as working conditions and market demand. To comparable-worth advocates, it doesn't seem fair that a truck-driver with no high school degree could earn more than a systems analyst with a college education.    The concept of comparable worth is alien to our political and cultural heritage. The thought of a government panel evaluating the intrinsic worth of different jobs is offensive.    Supply and demand are still the best instruments by which to determine prices, and the price of labor is no exception. Liberals like to pretend that labor is not a commodity -- that the work of human beings is somehow sacrosanct and exempt from the market forces that govern the prices of other commodities.    Only the free market can adequately respond to signals that require shifts in resources to make up for shortfalls and surpluses. No individual or committee can possess the vast knowledge necessary to set the wages and prices that efficiently allocate resources. These economic facts remain true in election years as well as nonelection years, and members of Congress should resist the current effort to endorse a wage system of sexist socialism.    ---   Rep.
