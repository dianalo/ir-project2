They found that human muscle cells affected by the diseaselargely lack a protein normally found on the cell surface.   Lack of that protein may permit the muscle destruction thatmarks the disease, the scientists reported in the British journalNature.   The work dealt with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It is a geneticdisorder that strikes boys almost exclusively, appearing in aboutone in every 3,500 male births in the United States.   It causes a progressive weakening and wasting of voluntarymuscles. Most patients must use wheelchairs by age 12, and most diein their early 20s.   The new work was done by Kevin Campbell and colleagues at theHoward Hughes Medical Institute and department of physiology andbiophysics at the University of Iowa College of Medicine.   The researchers followed up a 1987 discovery that the basicdefect in muscles affected by Duchenne is the lack of a proteincalled dystrophin. The protein is missing because of a flaw in thegene that normally tells muscle cells how to produce it.   At the time of the discovery, nobody knew what dystrophinnormally does in muscle cells, nor why its absence would cause thedisease.   One puzzle was that dystrophin had no apparent connection to thesurface of muscle cells, where scientists knew that earlyabnormalities occurred in Duchenne.   The new work provides that connection, shedding important lighton the Duchenne disease process, said Dr. Salvatore DiMauro ofColumbia University in New York.   Campbell and colleagues found that dystrophin is normally boundto a complex of four proteins on the surface of muscle cells.Dystrophin apparently acts to anchor the complex to cytoskeleton, aregion of fibrous material beneath the cell surface, Campbell saidin a telephone interview.   Researchers were able to test for the presence of one of thefour surface proteins, and they found that muscle samples fromDuchenne patients contained only about 10 percent of normal levels.Without its dystrophin anchor, the protein is probably destroyed bythe cell, Campbell said.   The researchers have not yet been able to check levels of theother proteins in the surface complex, he said. Perhaps the wholecomplex is missing or disrupted in Duchenne cells, triggering thedeath of muscle fibers, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
