Pair-binding potentialsof the Lennard-Jones-type were determined for PrAg/sub 0.5/Cu/sub 0.5/by minimizing its binding energy with respect to the seven structuralparametrs of its low-temperature phase (orthorhombic FeB-type). The potentialsdetermined were used to calculate the dynamical matrix for the higher-temperaturephase (cubic CsCl-type) of PrAg/sub 0.5/Cu/sub 0.5/, from which the phonondispersion curves along the principal cubic axis were generated. Thecalculated Ta{sub 1} (C{sub 44}) phonon mode at the zone-boundary (1/21/2 0) point was seen to soften progressively as x-increases, which isconsistent with the strong negative quadrupolar coupling found in cubicPrAg/sub 1-x/Cu/sub x/. Ultrasonic measurements on polycrystalline samplesof PrAg and PrAg/sub 0.6/Cu/sub 0.4/ were also carried out. Detailedmagnetization measurements were carried out on the Ho/sub 1-x/Y/sub x/Cusystem. Crystal-field analysis of the magnetization data in the paramagneticregime disclosed the existence of a negative quadrupolar coupling, whichincreases steadily in strength as x increases, while the bilinear exchangedecreases rapidly.</TEXT></DOC>
