A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows Mr. Bush leading the Massachusetts governor among likely voters by a margin of 45% to 41%; a month ago, just after the Republican convention, Mr. Bush held a 47%-40% lead. The new survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points, was conducted last Friday through Monday.    The poll also shows that 55% of all likely voters have heard or read about Mr. Dukakis's decade-old veto of a bill requiring the pledge of allegiance in Massachusetts schoolrooms. Half of those who know about the issue say it doesn't matter to them -- but three times as many people say it makes them less likely to vote for the Democrat as say it makes them more likely to vote for him.    Geographically, Mr. Bush builds his lead by running strongly in the West and South. Mr. Dukakis leads in the East, and the two are tied in the Midwest. The Democratic nominee has a big lead among black voters; Mr. Bush leads among whites.    The vice president is viewed more favorably than his opponent among people identified by The Wall Street Journal as &quot;swing voters,&quot; a group comprising undecided Democrats and Republicans, Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984 and who still approve of his performance, and strictly independent voters. These voters, who make up about a quarter of the electorate, give Mr. Bush a favorable-unfavorable rating of 49% to 30%; for Mr. Dukakis, the margin is 42% to 32%.    Mr. Dukakis managed to narrow his deficit in the trial-heat aspect of the poll principally by bettering his showing among two groups that are vital to his hopes: Reagan Democrats and women. Among all Reagan Democrats, the governor holds a 2-to-1 lead, 53% to 26%; last month, immediately after the GOP convention, the vice president had managed to shave the margin to 12 points, 47% to 35%.    Another potentially favorable sign for Gov. Dukakis is that those voters who haven't yet decided who they support come disproportionately from groups that tend to be more favorably disposed toward the Democrat: Women, blue-collar workers, Easterners, and people with household incomes under $20,000.    ---   'Which of the following comes closer to your feelings about the 1988 presidential election?'    A. The next president should continue along the path of Ronald Reagan's policies.    B. The next president should change direction.
