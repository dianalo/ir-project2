Introduction</ITAG>Section 122(h)(2) of CERCLA provides EPA, as well as any other departmentor agency authorized to undertake a response action under CERCLA, withauthority to promulgate regulations, after consultation with the AttorneyGeneral, for the use of arbitration as a method of settling certain CERCLAsection 107(a) claims for recovery of response costs incurred by the UnitedStates pursuant to section 104 of CERCLA. This authority is limited tocases in which the total response costs for the facility concerned do notexceed $500,000, excluding interest, and which have not been referred tothe Department of Justice for civil action.On August 4, 1988, EPA proposed a regulation to implement its authorityunder section 122(h)(2) of CERCLA (53 FR 29428). The August 4, 1988 preamblediscussed the purpose of the proposed rule in Part I and provided a detailedsummary of the proposed rule in Part II. EPA accepted public comment onthe proposed rule for 60 days and received 4 letters totalling 12 pagesof comment.Today, EPA is promulgating the final rule to implement its CERCLA section122(h)(2) authority. This rule establishes and governs the procedures forEPA's arbitration of CERCLA section 107(a) cost recovery claims. In preparingthis final rule, EPA has carefully considered all public comments on theproposed rule and is making some modifications in response to those comments.A summary of all comments received and EPA's response to each comment isprovided in Part II of today's preamble. All changes from the proposedto final rule are discussed in Part III of today's preamble. Part IV ofthis preamble presents supporting analyses, and Part V of this preambleprovides a list of subjects addressed by this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Responsiveness Summary</ITAG>Comments were received from 4 commenters. Commenter 1 is Texaco Inc. Commenter2 is Ford Motor Co. Commenter 3 is The Washington Legal Foundation. Commenter4 is The MITRE Corp. Comments that do not relate to any particular subpartof the proposed rule are identified as General. Comments relating to specificportions of the proposed rule are organized according to the subpart, section,and paragraph of the proposed rule to which they relate. Each comment containsa summary of the comment and EPA's response. <T3>Comment </T3>#1: (Commenter 1, General) Sites with response costs thatdo not exceed $500,000 will probably result in settlement, rather thanarbitration, unless there are only a handful of PRPs. <T3>Response:</T3> In enacting section 122(h)(2) of CERCLA, Congress recognizedthat arbitration could be a valuable settlement tool in appropriate circumstances.While the Agency recognizes that small cost recovery cases will often besettled by traditional means, rather than through arbitration, the Agencybelieves that arbitration offers a useful alternative. It may be particularlyuseful where there are multiple PRPs, because the parties may request thatthe arbitrator allocate responsibility for payment of EPA's response costsamong the participating PRPs. <T3>Comment </T3>#2: (Commenter 1, General) EPA's various attempts to favoritself in the proposed rule and to retain considerable unilateral authorityin the proposed rule will make it less likely that arbitration will beused. <T3>Response:</T3> This commenter also provides specific comments on theportions of the proposed rule that it considers biased in favor of theAgency. Each specific comment is discussed below. <T3>Comment </T3>#3: (Commenter 2, General) This comment expresses supportfor the use of arbitration to settle cost recovery claims and regrets thatthe statutorily imposed $500,000 cost limitation will minimize the availabilityof this process. <T3>Response:</T3> No response needed. <T3>Comment </T3>#4: (Commenter 2, General) The proposed rule containssome flaws, which, if left uncorrected, will limit the appeal of the processto PRPs and reduce its potential effectiveness. <T3>Response:</T3> This commenter also provides specific comments on theportions of the proposed rule which it believes to be flawed. Each specificcomment is discussed below. <T3>Comment </T3>#5: (Commenter 3, General) This comment expresses supportfor EPA's proposed rule because it benefits all parties involved by keepingpotential litigants out of the overcrowded federal courts, avoids needlessexpenditure of time and resources, avoids the atmosphere of hostility thatmay result from delays encountered in litigation, and offers a speedy settlementby an impartial party whose decision is not subject to <T3>de novo</T3> review in court and is not susceptible to multiple appeals.This commenter strongly favors EPA's implementation of its CERCLA Section122(h)(2) authority and agrees with EPA that arbitration is especiallyappropriate when the case does not present issues of national or precedentialsignificance. The commenter also supports this voluntary arbitration processbecause it will result in a binding decision on issues agreed upon by theparties and will thus obviate any future disputes as to the validity ofthe settlement. <T3>Response:</T3> No response needed. <T3>Comment </T3>#6: (Commenter 1, Subpart A, andSection;304.12(d)) It isunclear when the ``Association'' will be selected by EPA. The selectionof the arbitration organization should be made prior to a PRP request forarbitration. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees that, for arbitrations to be administeredby the ``Association,'' the ``Association'' should be selected prior toa PRP request for arbitration. EPA plans to select the ``Association''by competitive procurement. Because the procurement process is a lengthyprocedure, it is likely that there will be a period of time between theeffective date of this final rule and the award of a contract to the ``Association.''During this interim period, EPA believes that a vehicle should be availablefor conducting arbitrations pursuant to this regulation. Thus, EPA hasamended the proposed rule to permit EPA and one or more PRPs at a facilityto submit one or more issues arising in an EPA cost recovery claim forresolution by arbitration during the interim period between the effectivedate of the final rule and the award of a contract to the ``Association.''During the interim period, referral of a claim shall be accomplished byEPA and the participating PRP(s) entering into a joint request for arbitrationand reaching mutual agreement upon the selection and appointment of anarbitrator on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with appropriate procurementprocedures. Any arbitrations agreed upon in this manner shall be conductedin accordance with all provisions of this rule, except for those provisionsrelating specifically to the duties of the ``Association,'' which dutiesshall be performed in a manner agreed upon by the parties. All costs ofsuch arbitrations, including the arbitrator's fee, shall be divided equallyamong all parties, except that expenses of witnesses shall be borne bythe party producing such witnesses, the expense of an interpreter shallbe borne by the party requesting such interpreter, and the expense of thestenographic record and all transcripts thereof shall be prorated equallyamong all parties ordering copies. Amendments to the proposed rule whichprovide for these interim procedures are found at andSection;andSection;304.21(e)(Referral of claims), 304.22(e) (Appointment of Arbitrator), and 304.41(e)(Administrative fees, expenses, and Arbitrator's fee). <T3>Comment </T3>#7: (Commenter 2, Subpart A, andSection;304.12(d)) The preamblestates that an organization, defined as the ``Association,'' will be selectedbased upon its ability to provide technically-capable arbitrators and thatsuch organization will be required to ``make disclosures designed to ensurethat it is free from any institutional biases.'' The proposed rule shouldinclude criteria to select such an organization, specify the technicalcapabilities that arbitrators should possess, and include a requirementthat the selected organization make full disclosure. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA plans to select the arbitration association by competitiveprocurement. A great deal of information is routinely required of organizationsinterested in an EPA contract (<T3>e.g.,</T3> financial information, past performance on other contracts,key personnel) that will assist the Agency in identifying any possiblebias. EPA regulations also specifically address organizational conflictsof interest (48 CFR 1509, 1552.209-70, 1552.209-71, and 1552.209-72). Ifnecessary, EPA may request further organizational information and makeit part of the evaluation criteria in selecting the organization. Section304.23 of the proposed rule includes procedures for disclosure by eachindividual arbitrator and for disqualification of the arbitrator basedon circumstances likely to affect his or her impartiality. <T3>Comment </T3>#8: (Commenter 4, Subpart A, andSection;304.12(d)) The entityto serve as the ``Association'' should not be selected through a competitiveprocess which includes cost, in addition to qualifications and suitability,as one of its criteria. Including the cost criteria will preclude organizationsthat have chosen not to compete on the basis of cost from consideration.Such organizations are intrinsically freer from conflict of interest andbias and are better suited to serve as the ``Association'' than those whichbelong to the profit-making or cost-competing sector. A not-for-profitstatus coupled with a refusal to compete are indicative of a company'sdetermination to provide independent and objective analysis and to workin the public interest rather than as the agent of a client. This postureis essential in any third-party neutral and is particularly important inSuperfund settlements. Selection on the basis of cost may create the impressionthat the entity serves at the pleasure of EPA rather than occupying a neutralposition, because an entity selected due to financial considerations ismore subject to influence on the basis of those considerations than onethat is not. Selection on the basis of qualifications and suitability,without cost, would achieve fairness without endangering the success ofthe process. This is not to say that not-for-profit, non-cost-competingcompanies are not subject to cost controls; they undergo rigorous continualfederal government audits which result in governmental approval of costsensitive parameters for each upcoming year. Some also voluntarily adhereto the Cost Accounting Standards incorporated by reference in the FederalAcquisition Regulations. By procuring the services of one of these companieson the basis of qualifications, the government procures services, the costsof which have been previously determined by the government to be appropriateand competitive. <T3>Response: </T3>As noted in EPA's Response to Comments 6 and 7 above,EPA plans to select the ``Association'' by competitive procurement. Competitiveprocurement is the primary method by which Federal agencies award contracts.EPA has not determined that profit-making organizations are inherentlybiased, subject to influence, or otherwise incapable of performing thefunctions of the ``Association,'' or that there is some other compellingreason to restrict the basis for the selection of the ``Association'' inthe manner requested by the commenter. Accordingly, EPA declines to adoptthe commenter's suggestion.<T3>Comment andplusmin;9: </T3>(Commenter 1, Subpart B, andSection; 304.20(b))As written, if, during the course of the arbitration, projected responsecosts exceed $500,000, the arbitration will become nonbinding or terminate.Instead, the arbitrator should retain jurisdiction, and the arbitrationshould proceed as a binding arbitration so long as the original estimateof $500,000 was made in good faith and was supportable when the requestfor arbitration was submitted.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA's authority to use arbitration is contained in section122(h)(2) of CERCLA. That section authorizes use of arbitration as a methodof settling cost recovery claims of the United States ``where the totalresponse costs for the facility concerned do not exceed $500,000 (excludinginterest).'' If response costs increase to an amount that exceeds thisstatutory ceiling prior to the rendering of a final arbitral decision,EPA lacks authority to resolve the claim by binding arbitration and, therefore,declines to make the change requested. As noted in Part II.B. of the preambleto the proposed rule, EPA does not anticipate that the procedure for convertingthe proceeding to a non-binding arbitration will be often invoked, becausethe Agency does not intend to use arbitration under this rule unless anduntil it can establish, with reasonable accuracy and certainty, the totalamount of response costs incurred and to be incurred at the site.<T3>Comment andplusmin;10: </T3>(Commenter 2, Subpart B, andSection; 304.20(c))The second sentence of this paragraph states, ``Any issues arising in EPA'sclaim that are not submitted for resolution shall be deemed to be not indispute and shall not be raised in any action seeking enforcement of thedecision for the purpose of overturning or otherwise challenging the finaldecision, except as provided in section 304.40(c) of this part.'' Thissentence and the last sentence of andSection; 304.40(c)(3) should be deleted.(The last sentence of andSection; 304.40(c)(3) restates the prohibition andincludes an exception that allows a party to raise new issues if necessaryto show that the decision was achieved through fraud, misconduct, partiality,excess of jurisdiction or authority, or violation of public policy.) Theseprovisions should be deleted because the language can be interpreted tomean that any issue not raised during the arbitration, including unforseeableissues or issues that are not yet ripe, cannot be disputed in the futurein any forum. For example, a PRP group may wish to implement a proposedremedy, but may dispute EPA's claim for response costs. In such a case,arbitration of EPA's costs may be useful. Since the above language couldbe interpreted to mean that PRPs may not dispute issues which arise duringimplementation of the remedy, they may be reluctant to submit cost issuesto arbitration or feel compelled to raise all imaginable remedy issues,thereby increasing the complexity and cost of the arbitration. CERCLA casestypically involve several phases and all issues may not be ripe for resolutionat the same time.<T3>Response: </T3>First, it is highly unlikely that arbitration underthis rule could be used in the hypothetical situation posed by the commenter,because it can only be used if the total past and future response costsof the United States do not exceed $500,000. The United States' responsecosts at a site at which remedial action will be undertaken will most likelyexceed this statutory ceiling. Second, the purpose of the language to whichthe commenter refers is to ensure that the arbitral proceeding resultsin a final and binding decision on the EPA cost recovery claim submittedfor arbitration by precluding the parties from subsequently raising issuesnot presented to the arbitrator as a defense to payment of the arbitrator'saward. The achievement of a final and binding decision is one of the primaryadvantages of arbitration, which benefits EPA and the participating PRPsalike. Third, andSection; 304.20(c) deals only with issues in the arbitrationproceeding and enforcement thereof, and does not purport to limit the issuesparties may raise in other proceedings. Finally, the decision will notproduce the result the commenter fears because, under andSection; 304.40(d)of the proposed rule, the final decision is not admissible as evidenceof any issue of fact or law in any proceeding, except as needed for theUnited States to enforce the decision and obtain payment and except asneeded for a participating PRP to defend against a contribution actionconcerning the EPA cost recovery claim submitted for arbitration. For thesereasons, EPA declines to make the change requested.<T3>Comment andplusmin;11: </T3>(Commenter 2, Subpart B, andSection;andSection;304.20 (d)(3) and (d)(4)(i)) The proposed rule, in andSection; 304.20(d)(4)(i),identifies ability to pay as one of the factors that an arbitrator mayuse to allocate costs among participating PRPs if the joint request forarbitration does not specify the factors. Ability to pay should be deletedas one of the factors because: (1) it is dissimilar to the other factorswhich relate to the relative hazard to the public, <T3>e.g., </T3>mobility, toxicity, volume; (2) it may sanction the fundamentallyunjust proposition that liability should be assessed based on ability topay; (3) it may result in ``deep pocket'' PRPs shunning the arbitrationprocess; and (4) it may be used as guidance by the arbitrator when allocatingliability under andSection; 304.20(d)(3), which allows the arbitrator toallocate liability even if not requested by the parties. <T3>Response: </T3>As the commenter points out, andSection; 304.20(d)(4)(i),without waiving the general applicability of the joint and several liabilitystandard, offers the parties the option of specifying in the joint requestfor arbitration, the factors to be applied by the arbitrator in performingthe allocation. Thus, the parties may agree on a case-by-case basis thatability to pay will not be considered by the arbitrator as one of the factors.If the parties do not supply their own factors, this section specifiesthat the arbitrator shall base the allocation on such factors as the arbitratorconsiders relevant, in his or her sole discretion, such as volume, toxicity,and mobility of the hazardous substances, ability to pay, and inequitiesand aggravating factors. EPA believes that ability to pay is an appropriatefactor because, among other reasons, it is among the factors Congress hasauthorized the President to consider when evaluating CERCLA settlements.In addition to permitting the parties to specify their own allocation factors,the rule also addresses, through andSection; 304.20(d)(4)(ii), the commenter'sspecific concern that PRPs will avoid using arbitration if certain PRPsat the site are non-viable. That section permits the parties to specifyin the joint request that the arbitrator may allocate less than all responsecosts awarded to EPA. As noted in Part II.B. of the preamble to the proposedrule, one of the reasons this provision was included is to encourage PRPsto use arbitration even if certain PRPs at the site are non-viable. Finally,the commenter's concern that an arbitrator will consider ability to paywhen allocating liability for payment under the second sentence of andSection;304.20(d)(3) is unfounded. That provision directs the arbitrator to allocateliability based upon the portion of the harm attributable to each participatingPRP, if the arbitrator finds that the actual or threatened harm at thefacility is divisible. The provision applies only if the arbitrator findsthat harm at the facility is divisible and specifically directs the arbitratorto allocate liability for payment of EPA's award based upon the portionof the harm attributable to each participating PRP. It does not providethe arbitrator with the discretion to apply any other factors. For thesereasons, EPA declines to make the change requested.<T3>Comment andplusmin;12: </T3>(Commenter 3, Subpart B, andSection; 304.20(d)(4)(ii))The Commenter agrees with this provision, which allows the parties to specifyin the joint request that the arbitrator may allocate less than 100% ofresponse costs awarded to EPA. The commenter notes that this provisionis more generous than the rule enunciated in <T3>U.S. </T3>v. <T3>NEPACCO, </T3>819 F.2d 726, 747 (8th Cir. 1986) (United States entitledto recover all costs associated with any response action upheld as notarbitrary and capricious), but believes that it should be included sinceit will encourage PRPs to use arbitration because they will not be penalizedby having allocated to them response costs attributable to non-participatingor non-viable PRPs.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees that the proposed arbitration rule sets fortha standard of review and procedure that is more generous than that providedfor under the statute and case law. It is EPA's conclusion that, undersection 107 of CERCLA and established case law, EPA is entitled to recover``all costs'' incurred by EPA in connection with all aspects of a responseaction upheld as not arbitrary and capricious. For the limited purposeof encouraging PRP participation in arbitrations under this rule, the Agencyhas adopted the approach contained in andSection; 304.20(d)(4)(ii).<T3>Comment andplusmin;13: </T3>(Commenter 1, Subpart B, andSection; 304.20(e)(1))The arbitrator's review of the adequacy of any response action taken byEPA should not be limited to documents compiled by EPA, as would be requiredunder this provision.<T3>Response: </T3>Under section 113(j) of CERCLA, judicial review of anyissues concerning the adequacy of any response action taken or orderedby the President is limited to the administrative record upon which thePresident has based the selection of the response action. <T3>See, e.g., U.S. </T3>v. <T3>Seymour, </T3>679 F. Supp. 859 (S.D. Ind. 1987); <T3>U.S. </T3>v. <T3>Rohm andamp; Haas, </T3>660 F. Sup. 672 (D. N.J. 1987). As noted in PartII.B. of the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA maintains that, consistentwith section 113(j), the arbitrator's review of any issue concerning EPA'sresponse action shall be based upon the documents which formed the basisfor the selection of the response action, <T3>i.e., </T3>the administrative record. These documents will includeany written public comments received by EPA concerning the selection ofthe response action and any EPA responses thereto. For this reason, EPAdeclines to make the change requested. EPA has, however, deleted the phrase``compiled by EPA'' from this section, because, in addition to EPA, a Stateor political subdivision of a State, or an Indian Tribe, or another Federalagency may compile the administrative record when it has been designatedas the ``lead agency'' for the site within the meaning of the NationalContingency Plan, 40 CFR Part 300. A conforming change has been made toandSection;andSection; 304.30(b)(3), 304.30(c)(3), and 304.32(j)(6).<T3>Comment andplusmin;14: </T3>(Commenter 3, Subpart B, andSection; 304.20(e)(2)(iii) and (e)(3)(iii)) Under the proposed rule, once EPA's responseaction is upheld (in part or in full), the arbitrator is required to reviewEPA's costs on an arbitrary and capricious standard and to award EPA allcosts incurred (for the portions of the response action upheld) unlessthe participating PRPs can show the costs were: (1) Not actually incurredor to be incurred; or (2) not actually incurred or to be incurred in connectionwith the response action; or (3) clearly excessive, taking into accountthe circumstances of the response action and relative to acceptable governmentprocurement and contracting practices in light of the circumstances ofthe response action. Under <T3>U.S. </T3>v. <T3>NEPACCO, </T3>the United States is entitled to recover all costs associatedwith any response action upheld as not arbitrary and capricious. As such,the ``clearly excessive'' standard is more generous than the standard appliedin judicial cost recovery proceedings. However, it has several clear benefitsthat weigh in favor of its use: (1) It encourages PRPs to use arbitrationrather than take their chances in court, in which forum the issue of excessivecosts is not necessarily relevant; (2) it places the burden of proof uponthe PRP and thus requires little additional work on the part of the Agency;(3) it contains sufficient qualifications that PRPs will rarely be ableto prove the costs were excessive. Thus, although the standard is moregenerous than that which would be applied in the judicial arena, the benefitsclearly outweigh any detriment.<T3>Response: </T3>Again, as set forth in the Response to Comment andplusmin;12,EPA agrees that the standard of review provided in andSection; 304.20 (e)(2)(iii)and (e)(3)(iii) is more generous than PRPs are entitled to in judicialcost recovery actions. It is EPA's view that, under the language of section107 of CERCLA, judicial review of EPA's costs is limited to whether thecosts incurred were not inconsistent with the NCP. Under this standard,matters to be reviewed are confined to: Whether the implemented cleanupwas consistent with the response action selected by EPA; whether the responseaction was performed; and whether the claimed costs were actually incurred.Unless the selection of the response action is determined to be inconsistentwith the NCP, based on a standard of review of arbitrary and capriciousor otherwise not in accordance with law, EPA is entitled to recover allits actual costs of implementation of the response action. This circumscribedreview of costs is intended to support the principal objectives of CERCLA:(1) To place the ultimate financial burden of hazardous waste cleanup onthose parties responsible for the problem; and (2) to assure prompt replenishmentof the Superfund so that monies can be rededicated to response work atthe thousands of other hazardous waste sites in the country that remainunaddressed. EPA has developed a more flexible standard of review for thelimited purpose of encouraging use of the arbitration regulation for smallcost recovery cases. Permitting PRPs to challenge actual costs to the extentthey are clearly excessive, an issue which is not relevant in litigation,may make arbitration more attractive to PRPs than litigation.  <T3>Comment andplusmin;15: </T3>(Commenter 1, Subpart B, andSection; 304.21(b)(2))Waiver of the right to notice and service by a party who fails to furnishinformation relating to the service (<T3>i.e., </T3>a party's name, address, and telephone number, and, if theparty is represented by an attorney, the attorney's name, address, andtelephone number) should be limited only to the period of time during whichthe party fails to provide such information. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees with this comment and has amended this subparagraphaccordingly. <T3>Comment andplusmin;16: </T3>(Commenter 1, Subpart B, andSection; 304.24(b))The last sentence of this paragraph should not allow EPA greater rightsto withdraw from the arbitration than provided to other parties.  <T3>Response: </T3>Under andSection; 304.24(b), any party may move to withdrawfrom the arbitral proceeding within thirty days after receipt of noticeof appointment of the arbitrator. After this thirty-day period, only EPAmay withdraw from the proceeding in according with andSection; 304.20(b)(3)or andSection; 304.33(e). Sections 304.20(b)(3) and 304.33(e) address EPA'sright to withdraw if public comments received on the proposed arbitraldecision disclose to EPA facts or considerations which indicate the proposeddecision is inappropriate, improper or inadequate. Section 122(i) of CERCLArequires that EPA provide a thirty-day public comment period on all settlementsreached through arbitration pursuant to section 122(h)(2). Section 122(i)(3)of CERCLA requires EPA to consider any comments filed in determining whetherto finalize the settlement and authorizes EPA to withdraw from the settlementif the comments disclose facts or considerations which indicate the proposedsettlement is inappropriate, improper or inadequate. EPA's right to withdrawbased upon public comments is authorized by section 122(i)(3) of CERCLA,and, for this reason, EPA declines to make the requested change. As notedin Part II.C. of the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA anticipates thatwithdrawal from the proceeding as a result of public comment will be aninfrequent occurrence, because small cost recovery decisions of this kindare not likely to generate a large amount of public comment.  <T3>Comment andplusmin;17: </T3>(Commenter 1, Subpart C, andSection; 304.32(j)(6))This subparagraph unfairly gives only EPA the right to supplement the documentscompiled by EPA which formed the basis for the selection of the responseaction.  <T3>Response: </T3>As noted in EPA's Response to Comment andplusmin;13 above,EPA maintains that any review of any issue concerning the adequacy of anyresponse action taken or ordered by EPA should, consistent with section113(j) of CERCLA, be based upon the documents which formed the basis forthe selection of the response action. Section 113(j)(1) of CERCLA permitssupplemental materials to be considered by a court in accordance with applicableprinciples of administrative law. EPA has, therefore, amended andSection;304.32(j)(6) to authorize the arbitrator to permit any party to supplementthe documents which formed the basis for the selection of the responseaction if any party demonstrates that supplementation is appropriate basedupon applicable principles of administrative law. The language to whichthe commenter objects has been deleted.  <T3>Comment andplusmin;18: </T3>(Commenter 1, Subpart D, andSection; 304.40(c)(2)(iv))Among the grounds provided for challenging a final arbitral decision isthat it violates ``public policy.'' This term is so broad that arbitraldecisions will be subject to challenge for virtually any reason so longas the appeal is couched in terms of ``public policy.''  <T3>Response: </T3>Section 304.40(c)(2) provides four grounds for challengingthe final arbitral decision, the last of which is that the decision violatespublic policy. As noted in Part II.D. of the preamble to the proposed rule,these four grounds are based upon generally accepted common law groundsfor overturning an arbitrator's decision, as reflected in case law. <T3>See, Local Union No. 28 </T3>v. <T3>Newspaper Agency Corp., </T3>485 F. Supp. 511 (D. Utah 1980). The Agencydoes not agree that allowing challenges based upon violation of publicpolicy will permit challenges for virtually any reason.

Changes From Proposed to Final Rule  </ITAG>This section summarizes the changes that have been made to the proposedrule. The reason for each of these changes is discussed in Part II of thispreamble or is provided below.  <T3>Section 304.10: </T3>The authority citation in this section has beenchanged from section 122(h) of CERCLA to section 122(h)(2) of CERCLA toprovide a more accurate citation.  <T3>Section 304.12: </T3>Two clarifying changes have been made to thissection. Paragraph (d) of this section, which defines the ``Association,''has been amended to add the words ``to conduct arbitrations pursuant tothis part'' to the end of the definition. Paragraph (g) of this section,which defines ``interested person,'' has been amended to add the words``to the proceeding'' after the word ``party.''  <T3>Section 304.20: </T3>Two changes have been made to this section. First,for clarification, the words ``actual or threatened'' have been insertedbefore the word ``harm'' each time it appears in the second sentence ofparagraph (d)(3) of this section. Second, the words ``compiled by EPA''have been deleted from the last sentence of paragraph (e)(1) of this sectionbecause the administrative record may be compiled by a Federal agency otherthan EPA, or by a State or political subdivision of a State, or by an IndianTribe when such non-EPA entity is designated as ``lead agency'' withinthe meaning of the NCP. The identical change has been made to andSection;andSection;304.30(b)(3), 304.30(c)(3), and 304.32(j)(6). This change is explainedin Comment andplusmin;13, Part II, of this preamble.<T3>Section 304.21: </T3>Four changes have been made to this section. First,the words ``may be'' in the first clause of paragraph (a) of this sectionhave been changed to ``is'' for clarification. Second, the last sentenceof paragraph (b)(2) of this section has been amended to clarify that aparty who fails to furnish the information necessary for notice and serviceunder this part is deemed to have waived his or her right to notice andservice only until such time as that party furnishes the missing information.(<T3>See </T3>Comment andplusmin;5, Part II, of this preamble for explanation.)Third, paragraph (b)(ix) of this section has been deleted. This preambleclarified that EPA will select the ``Association'' through competitiveprocurement. Since EPA cannot advance funds to a contractor, referencesin the proposed rule implying advances by EPA of filing fees, administrativefees and expenses, and the arbitrator's fee have been deleted. (<T3>See </T3>andSection; 304.41 (a) and (d) and the discussion of changesto these two paragraphs below.) Fourth, a new paragraph (e) has been addedto this section. This paragraph explains that, prior to EPA's selectionof the Association, EPA and one or more PRPs at a facility may agree tosubmit one or more issues arising in an EPA cost recovery claim for resolutionby arbitration. Any such agreement must be contained in a joint requestfor arbitration which meets all requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.New paragraph (e) also provides that any arbitration agreed upon in thismanner shall be governed by this final rule, except for those provisionswhich pertain specifically to the duties of the Association, which dutiesshall be performed in a manner agreed upon by the parties. It also explainsthat in any arbitration initiated pursuant to new paragraph (e), the selectionand appointment of the arbitrator shall be governed by new andSection; 304.22(e),and payment of all costs of the arbitration shall be governed by new andSection;304.41(e), both of which are described below. The third and fourth changesto this section are explained in Comment andplusmin;6, Part II, of this preamble.<T3>Section 304.22: </T3>Two changes have been made to this section. First,the word ``accepted'' in the fifth sentence of paragraph (b) has been changedto ``invited'' for clarification. Second, a new paragraph (e) has beenadded to this section. This new paragraph (e) explains that if EPA andone or more PRPs at a facility agree to arbitrate an EPA cost recoveryclaim prior to the selection of the Association as provided in andSection;304.21(e), they shall reach mutual agreement upon the selection and appointmentof an arbitrator on a case-by-case basis, and the Administrator shall obtainthe services of the arbitrator using appropriate procurement procedures.New paragraph (e) further provides that any person appointed as an arbitratorin this manner shall make disclosures to the parties pursuant to andSection;304.23 of this part, shall arbitrate the claim pursuant to the jurisdictionand authority granted to the arbitrator under andSection; 304.20 of thispart, and shall otherwise conduct the arbitration pursuant to the proceduresestblished by this rule. This second change is explained in Comment andplusmin;6,Part II, of this preamble.<T3>Section 304.31: </T3>Paragraph (e) of this section has been amendedto require a party who intends to be represented by counsel to providethe telephone number of counsel in addition to the name and address. Theidentical change has been made to andSection; 304.32(e). This change is neededto make the information required by andSection;andSection; 304.31(e) and 304.32(e)consistent with that required by andSection; 304.21(b)(2) (Referral of Claims).<T3>Section 304.32: </T3>Paragraph (j)(6) of this section has been amended.The first sentence has been changed to allow the arbitrator to permit anyparty to supplement the documents which formed the basis for the selectionof the response action (with additional documents, affidavits, or oraltestimony) if any party demonstrates that supplementation is appropriatebased upon applicable principles of administrative law. The second sentenceof this paragraph has been deleted. This change is explained in Commentandplusmin;17, Part II, of this preamble.<T3>Section 304.33: </T3>Paragraph (d) of this section has been amendedto require service of the proposed decision to be made by certified mail,return receipt requested, or by personal service to ensure that the decisionis received by the parties.<T3>Section 304.40: </T3>Two changes have been made to this section. First,paragraph (c)(1) of this section has been amended to clarify that the finaldecision is a settlement under section 122(h) of CERCLA, which may be directlyenforced pursuant to section 122(h)(3) of CERCLA. As amended, the firstand second sentences of paragraph (c)(1) have been modified to providethat: ``If any award made in the final decision is not paid within thetime required by andSection; 304.33(f) of this part, the final decision maybe enforced as a settlement under section 122(h) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(h),by the Attorney General on behalf of EPA in an appropriate Federal districtcourt pursuant to section 122(h)(3) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(h)(3).''The remainder of this paragraph is unchanged. Second, the first clauseof paragraph (d) of this section, ``[e]xcept as otherwise provided in thissecion,'' has been amended for clarification to indicate the more precisecross-reference to paragraph (c) of this section.<T3>Section 304.41: </T3>Three changes have been made to this section.First, the last two sentences of paragraph (a) of this section have beendeleted. As noted in the discussion of andSection; 304.21 above, EPA cannotadvance fees to a contractor. Accordingly, the requirement that all partiesadvance the filing fee has been deleted from paragraph (a). PRPs may, ofcourse, provide such an advance. Second, paragraph (d) of this sectionhas been similarly revised to delete references to advance deposits fromall parties for the arbitrator's fee and the administrative fee, and toprovide instead that the ``Association'' make appropriate arrangementsfor payment of these fees by the parties. Third, a new paragraph (e) hasbeen added to this section. It provides that in any arbitration conductedprior to the selection of the Association (<T3>see </T3>andSection; 304.21(e)), all fees and expenses of the arbitralproceeding, including the arbitrator's fee, shall be divided equally amongall parties, except that expenses of witnesses shall be borne by the partyproducing such witnesses, expenses of an interpreter shall be borne bythe party requesting such interpreter, and expenses of the stenographicrecord and all transcripts thereof shall be prorated equally among allparties ordering copies. This change is explained in Comment andplusmin;6,Part II, of this preamble.<T3>Section 304.42: </T3>Paragraph (c) of this section has been amendedto require the parties to serve all papers associated with the proceedingby personal service, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, orby first class mail, and to require the arbitrator and the ``Association''to serve all papers associated with the proceeding by personal serviceor by certified mail, return receipt requested. This change is to ensurethat all papers from the arbitrator and the ``Association'' are receivedby the parties.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary of Supporting Analyses</ITAG>A. Executive Order No. 12291Regulations must be classified as major or non-major to satisfy the rulemakingprotocol established by Executive Order No. 12291. According to ExecutiveOrder No. 12291, major rules are regulations that are likely to resultin:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export matters.EPA has determined that this regulation is a non-major rule under ExecutiveOrder No. 12291 because it will not result in any of the impacts identifiedabove. This regulation provides an entirely voluntary procedure by whichPRPs at a facility may reach agreement with EPA to have their liabilityfor a CERCLA section 107(a) cost recovery claim resolved by arbitration.Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution technique that shouldprovide a quicker and less costly method of resolution than traditionallitigation or negotiation. Therefore, the Agency has not prepared a regulatoryimpact analysis for this regulation. This regulation was submitted to theOffice of Management and Budget for review as required by Executive OrderNo. 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires that a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis be performed for all rules that are likely to have ``significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' EPA certifiesthat this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities because the rule provides a wholly voluntary procedureby which PRPs at a facility may reach agreement with EPA to have theirliability for a CERCLA section 107(a) cost recovery claim resolved by arbitration.Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution technique that shouldprovide a quicker and less expensive method of resolution than traditionallitigation or negotiation. Therefore, EPA has not prepared a RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThis regulation is not subject to the provisions of the Paperwork ReductionAct. Any collection of information in this regulation is required in thecourse of an enforcement action against a specific party or parties and,therefore, is exempt from coverage under the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 304</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Intergovernmental relations,Hazardous substances, Hazardous wastes, Natural resources, Superfund.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.

A party changing any ofthis information must promptly communicate the change in writing to theAssociation and all other parties. A party who fails to furnish such informationor any changes thereto is deemed to have waived his or her right to noticeand service under this part until such time as the party furnishes themissing information.(c) Any party may move to modify the joint request for arbitration to includeone or more additional issues arising in the referred claim. To be effective,any such modification must be signed by the Arbitrator and all other parties.The joint request for arbitration may also be modified to add one or moreadditional parties, if such intervention is permitted by andSection; 304.24(a)of this part. To be effective, any such modification must be signed bythe Arbitrator, the intervening party or parties, and all other parties.(d) The statute of limitations governing the EPA claim submitted for arbitrationshall be extended for a time period equal to the number of days from thedate the joint request for arbitration is submitted to the Associationto the date of resolution of any enforcement action relating to the finaldecision.(e) Prior to the selection of the Association, the Administrator and oneor more PRPs associated with a facility may agree to submit one or moreissues arising in an EPA claim for resolution by arbitration.
