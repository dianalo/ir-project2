(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Pershing II rocket motor was fired successfully early yesterday, sending a plume of exhaust across the plains in a pollution test designed to help determine whether the site can be used to demolish missiles as required by a new U.S.-Soviet treaty.    Originally scheduled for May 20, the test burn had been delayed because of bad weather. Yesterday was the last day open for the test under the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty.    The 58-second test started at 6:36 a.m. at Pueblo Army Depot Activity 15 miles east of here, officials said.    &quot;There was a steady, bright white light from the end of the rocket nozzle extending approximately 75-80 feet,&quot; said depot spokeswoman Mary Wilson.    A brownish plume stretched out horizontally before the wind swept it across sagebrush-covered plains and about 50 monitors set out by the Colorado Department of Health, which will analyze the exhaust to see if such firings would pose any threat to the environment.    &quot;The firing was conducted successfully. We expect the test itself will be a success from our initial indications,&quot; Ms. Wilson said.    The intermediate nuclear weapons treaty was ratified last week by the Senate, and copies are scheduled to be exchanged today at the summit meeting in Moscow between Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan.    The treaty requires that the Army's 420 Pershing missiles be destroyed. The U.S. plans to destroy the missiles by firing their rocket motors, which cannot be reused.    Brad Beckham, director of the Health Department's Air Pollution Control Division, said it would be several weeks before a complete assessment of the test firing data will be complete. The department required the test before the Army can designate the depot for the $9 million program.    &quot;We didn't believe that the composition of the propellant would present any significant environmental problem. We did have some concern for some of the pollutants and the net result from the test fire,&quot; Mr. Beckham said.    Hydrogen chloride, which in extremely high levels can be an irritant, is one of the pollutants the division will be studying, Mr. Beckham said. He noted that a similar test burn was conducted in Alabama in March.    Because the Army stores and maintains Pershings at Pueblo, the installation is the preferred site for demolishing them, but three other installations also are being considered, Ms. Wilson said. </TEXT></DOC>
