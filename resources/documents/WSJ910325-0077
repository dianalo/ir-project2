The small-business community's largest trade group hassome clues. Each year the National Federation of IndependentBusiness takes the pulse of its members on a wide range oflegislative and business issues judged critical in eachstate.</LP><TEXT>   On several common issues, small-business owners broadlyagree, wherever they reside. They overwhelmingly opposelegislation to mandate such employee benefits as parentalleave and health-insurance coverage, and they strongly favormeasures to pare worker compensation costs. They vehementlydisapprove of nearly all proposals to boost taxes, such asextending state sales taxes to include services, and theydislike attempts to restrict student working hours.   But on other issues results vary. Here are capsulesummaries of small-business owners' views in various stateson several major issues:                                                                                                          Environment                                                                                                          Environmental matters -- from hazardous and solid waste toair pollution -- concern a growing number of statelegislatures and the small-business community. When surveyed,a majority of owners report they participate in recycling --61% do so in Kentucky and 63% in Oregon -- and they thinkstates should provide aid to small businesses to help themcomply with environmental regulations. In North Dakota 63%want such help, as do 54% in Pennsylvania. But they opposeadditional fees for such aid.   By wide margins, owners in New Mexico and Texas say theydon't want lawmakers to pass harsher state environmentalregulations than existing federal rules. In Washington, by a4-to-1 margin, owners want a delay to comply with the state'sClear Air act, citing costs.   Arizona owners strongly back a sales-tax credit to smallbusinesses to purchase environmental-control equipment, andMichigan owners narrowly favor imposing higher landfill feesto pay for environmental cleanup efforts. Members in Hawaii,by 53% to 39%, support a tax-credit system for employers whoencourage alternatives to cars to ease traffic congestion.                                                                                                          Taxes/Fiscal                                                                                                          As more states face pressing fiscal problems, thesmall-business community overwhelmingly favors spending cutsover tax increases as a remedy. By 92% to 5%, Rhode Islandowners want state hiring frozen before taxes are raised. Anddon't tax services, say owners in California, Minnesota,Florida and Michigan. If legislators must drop some sales-taxexemptions, the favorite targets in Mississippi arenewspapers and commercial fishing boats.   Owners don't favor raising taxes to improve basiceducation either; they're against it by 73% to 26% inArkansas. And in Illinois, 58% oppose making permanent atemporary two-year income tax increase for education. Idahoowners strongly reject a one-cent tax on carbonated beveragesand South Dakota owners oppose a 1% &quot;bed, booze and board&quot;tax to help promote tourism.   Small-business owners in Massachusetts do favor allowingbusinesses to keep a certain amount of sales tax they collectto offset the collection cost.                                                                                                          Labor                                                                                                          Small-business operators continue to oppose manylabor-related proposals. In Ohio, for instance, 84% of ownersdisapprove of a state occupational safety and healthadministration to enforce state workplace safety laws, while8% approve. And Colorado small employers oppose legislationrequiring on-the-job safety programs.   By a 3-to-1 margin, Iowa owners favor eliminating theautomatic 1992 rise in the state minimum wage to $4.65 anhour. Federation members in New Jersey oppose, by 71% to 13%,a state law mandating strict regulation of video displayterminals; they back legislation sanctioning random drugtesting at work, 2 to 1.   Pennsylvania owners favor repealing 53-year-old statelegislation that permits only the physically disabled to workat home for companies.                                                                                                          General Business                                                                                                          A wide assortment of business issues has surfaced inseveral states. California and Missouri small-businessoperators strongly favor restricting or banning &quot;junk mail&quot;sent via fax, and California owners also oppose a stateinsurance fund to provide business-interruption funds when anearthquake hits.   Members in Connecticut strongly support legislationbarring banks from assessing depositors a charge for badchecks. In Illinois, they narrowly reject requiring utilitiesto pay for business losses caused by service interruptions,and in Maine, they oppose by 51% to 42% using funds from thestate's retirement system to invest in Maine businesses. By a2-to-1 margin, Texas owners approve deregulating theintrastate trucking industry there.   Kentucky owners think the state is doing an inadequate jobof promoting tourism. Members in New Hampshire favor doublingto $5,000 the limit on filing suits in Small Claims Court.Wyoming narrowly opposed the use of triple trailers for atest period on interstate highways.                                                                                                          Education                                                                                                          Many small-business owners are dissatisfied with thequality of public education in their states. Only 2% ofTennessee owners consider the quality of education there asexcellent, while 66% rate it fair or poor. In Ohio, just 3%rate the quality excellent and 55% consider it fair or poor.But, 3 to 1, Federation members in Tennessee oppose abroad-based personal income tax to pay for education reforms,and Ohio members overwhelmingly reject raising taxes to boosteducation funds.   Delaware owners narrowly favor education vouchers to allowparents to send their children to the school of their choice,but Vermont owners narrowly reject that idea. Elsewhere,members in South Carolina think retail stores run by statecolleges should be restricted to selling only those itemsnecessary in pursuit of a career. In Idaho, owners opposetripling to six the number of community colleges.   ---                  A Shortage of Skills                                                                                                          Share of small-business owners in selected statesreporting trouble finding employees with necessary skills                                                                                                        Nevada                                70% Arizona                               62% California                            62% North Carolina                        61% Michigan                              54% New Mexico                            54% Iowa                                  46%                                                                                                          Source: National Federation of Independent Business, 1991survey</TEXT></DOC>
