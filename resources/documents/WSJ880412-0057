The new agency, Lord Einstein O'Neill andamp; Partners, called Lord Geller's request for the order &quot;simply the latest attempt by Lord Geller to convince the court to reconsider its earlier decision denying injunctive relief against Lord Einstein.&quot;    Last week, Judge Herman Cahn temporarily blocked Richard Lord, former chairman of Lord Geller, and Arthur Einstein Jr., its former president, from soliciting or accepting Lord Geller clients. But the judge left open the possibility that the new agency can accept Lord Geller clients. A suit filed against the new agency by WPP Group PLC, Lord Geller's parent, had sought injunctions barring the new agency from conducting any business at all.    Lord Geller said yesterday that the judge scheduled a hearing on the order for Thursday. Lord Geller is also asking the judge to prevent the new agency from hiring any Lord Geller employee for six months. </TEXT></DOC>
