In a speech here, Mr. Ruder said the commission plans to investigate &quot;a series of takeover-related questions,&quot; including whether takeover stocks led the market decline. He said the commission also will investigate whether investment banking firms had liquidity problems because of their so-called bridge loans to finance takeovers. Finally, he said the SEC will study how the hundreds of corporate buy-back plans announced in the wake of the crash affected the market.    Those three lines of inquiry come in addition to several subjects of investigation that Mr. Ruder listed in congressional testimony earlier this month.    In both that testimony and in his speech Friday to the American Corporate Counsel Association, Mr. Ruder indicated that the commission's foremost concern is the recent volatility of the market. &quot;The commission is deeply concerned about the impact of market volatility on public investors, on corporations, on market professionals and on the structure of the market itself,&quot; he said Friday.    In addition to investigating the causes and effects of that volatility, Mr. Ruder told Congress that the SEC plans to look into five areas: the role of index-related trading; market-making capacity; operational capacity of the securities markets; financial integrity of broker-dealers; and the effects of the internationalization of the markets.    In discussing the commission's interest in takeover-related questions, Mr. Ruder noted that some market commentators have blamed the crash partly on several controversial anti-takeover provisions contained in the House-passed deficit-reduction package. The proposed legislation would disallow interest deductions for debt incurred in a hostile takeover and for interest expense of more than $5 million a year on debt incurred in buying back the majority of a company's stock. In addition, it would impose a 50% nondeductible excise tax on &quot;greenmail.&quot;    House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) has said that he would consider modifications of those provisions.    In his speech, Mr. Ruder didn't elaborate on SEC concerns over the effect of bridge loans on firms' liquidity.    Bridge loans -- short-term financing provided while the borrower puts in place a longer-term loan -- have become increasingly popular on Wall Street as a method of financing takeovers. They have worried many in the securities industry who fear firms are risking large chunks of capital in transactions that could come apart.    Just last week, Southland Corp.'s postponement of a big offering of &quot;junk bonds&quot; left Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. at least temporarily stuck with about $100 million each in bridge loans.    In examining the recent spate of corporate buy-backs, Mr. Ruder said, the SEC will try to see whether the purchases &quot;had any effect on the market.&quot; Since the Oct. 19 market crash, some 600 companies have announced their intention to make buy-backs with a market value totaling roughly $34 billion. But it isn't clear to what extent they have followed up with purchases.    In his speech, Mr. Ruder reiterated the SEC position that federal law should preempt state law in the area of tender offers, a subject touched on by several pending bills. &quot;I believe that corporations whose activities and ownership are national in scope shouldn't be given protection against takeovers by the states where their primary production facilities are located,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
