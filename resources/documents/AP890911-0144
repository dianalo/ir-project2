The United States, Britain and West Germany welcomed the exodusMonday of thousands of East Germans from Hungary through Austria tonew homes in West Germany.   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucherpraised Hungary, which boldly opened its borders to the West indefiance of a Warsaw Pact ally.   ``We also commend Austria for its help and support and we admirethe efforts of (West Germany) to offer a home to fellow Germansseeking freedom,'' Boucher said.   The Soviet news agency Tass made the criticism in a commentary onthe historic exodus that followed the Hungarian government'sdecision Sunday to allow all East Germans to leave for West Germany.   ``A number of press bodies, television networks and radio of theF.R.G. (Federal Republic of Germany) instigate G.D.R. (GermanDemocratic Republic) people to unlawful actions, while missions ofthe Federal Republic abroad, in violation of generally recognizednorms of international law, assume protection of those persons andsupply them with West German documents,'' Tass said.   Several hundred East Germans, seeking safe passage to the West,are holed up in West Germany's embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.   Tass said Western news outlets have been waging a ``tendentiouscampaign'' based on the illegal departures of some East Germans.   It was the first comment on the greatest flood of East Germanrefugees since 1961, the year the Berlin Wall halted the flow to theWest. State television, in its evening news broadcast ``Vremya,''showed some of the refugees Monday.   Tass said the campaign and ``propaganda hullabaloo'' wereconducted by those who have ``the absurd idea of `engulfing''' EastGermany.   The commentary reiterated the Kremlin's loyalty to its East blocally.   East Germany ``is an inalienable part of the Warsaw Treaty'' and``our true friend and ally,'' Tass said.   Hungary's action marks the first time a Warsaw Pact country hasaided an exodus of refugees from an allied communist nation.   Britain's foreign secretary, John Major, said Monday that thethousands of East Germans left for the West because the governmentfailed to provide for its citizens' basic needs.   ``The clearest conclusion we can draw from the backdrop of theGerman refugees is the extent to which the East German governmenthas failed in the job it should have done over recent years toprovide a reasonable standard of living,'' said Major in aninterview with the Independent Television Network from Washington,where he met with President Bush.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, during a speech in Bremen,said that until East Germany adopts reforms, West Germany will beseen as a Mecca for unhappy East German citizens.   Klaus Bolling, former head of the West German mission to EastGermany, said there was a danger the situation was overheating. Hetold ITN that urgent reforms were need in East Germany but that theywere unlikely since he could not see a ``German version of (SovietPresident Mikhail S.) Gorbachev.''   Bolling was referring to the freer climate in the Soviet Unionunder Gorbachev.   ``I listened to a member of the Central Committee in East Berlina few weeks ago,'' Bolling said. ``He was saying, `Who could haveimagined that the Soviet Union would be the place where thecounterrevolution would start?'''</TEXT></DOC>
