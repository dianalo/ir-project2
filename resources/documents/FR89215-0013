The Fort Worth Air RouteTraffic Control Center requested the alteration to provide improved courseguidance in that area, thereby increasing safety in the vicinity of theBrownwood MOA. This action enhances safety by adding a dogleg in an areawhere military activity is concentrated. Interested parties were invitedto participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written commentson the proposal to the FAA. One comment objecting to the proposal was receivedfrom the Air Transport Association of America (ATA) because of the following:1. The proposed change would increase the mileage between Abilene and SanAntonio. 2. The proposed change would permanently realign the jet route around airspaceoccasionally used for military operations. The FAA concurs with the objections offered by the ATA. FAA has determinedthat the realignment of J-17 would be a burden on the public, therefore,J-17 will not be changed from its current alignment. Except for the extensionof J-65 over the proposed dogleg for J-17 and editorial changes, this amendmentis the same as that proposed in the notice. Section 75.100 of Part 75 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in Handbook 7400.6D datedJanuary 4, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule </ITAG>This amendment to Part 75 of the Federal Aviation Regulations alters onlythe description of J-65 located in the vicinity of Abilene, TX. The FAAhas realigned J-65 by adding a west dogleg between Abilene and San Antonio,TX. After a review of the proposed action to realign J-17, the FAA leavesJ-17 unchanged and extends J-65 over the dogleg route we had originallyproposed for J-17 in the NPRM. This action provides increased safety byproviding improved course guidance in the vicinity of Brownwood, TX, MilitaryOperations Area (MOA). The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 75 </ITAG>Aviation safety, Jet routes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, Part 75 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 75) is amended, as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 75_ESTABLISHMENT OF JET ROUTES AND AREA HIGH ROUTES </ITAG>1.
