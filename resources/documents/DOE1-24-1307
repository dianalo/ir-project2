The method takes advantage of low-cost computationoptions, available plant growth models that can be adapted to pollutantimpact studies, extensive data available from monitoring and experimentstations in agricultural areas, and the advances in stochastic computermethods that can account for temporal variability of weather and spatialvariability of soil and plant characteristics. The approach embracesthe complexities of soil-plant-atmosphere interactions as a step towardsrobust decisions about simplification for continuing assessment investigations.Process models can contribute to a sound knowledgeable basis for assessmentprograms such as the National Crop Loss Assessment Network in the UnitedStates. 74 refs.; 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
