The reaction      mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The purple reaction      mixture was poured into water and the resultant precipitate was collected      by suction-filtration to give a crude product. The crude product was      dissolved in ethyl acetate (50 ml), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate,      and filtered to get a colorless solution. The solvent was evaporated on a      rotary evaporator affording 1.10 g (67.1% yield) of      N'-methoxycarbonyl-N'-3-bromopropargyl 4-chloro-benzaldehyde hydrazone as      a solid. m.p.andequals;102.degree.-105.degree.

A volume      of the stock solution is dispensed into culture media to give an initial      starting test concentration of 500 ppm compound. </PAR><PAR>  The test is carried out by adding an equal volume of broth to each vessel      in the dilution series, escept for the first vessel. The first vessel      contains twice the volume of broth plus the initial concentration of test      compound. One half of the broth from the first vessel is transferred to      the second vessel. After being mixed, one half the resulting volume is      removed from the second vessel and transferred to the third vessel. The      entire cycle is repeated sufficiently to give a series of concentrations      amounting to 500, 250, 125, 63, 31, 16, 8, and 4 ppm (or 100, 50, 25,      12.5, 6.2, 3.1, 1.6, and 0.8), respectively. </PAR><PAR>  Each vessel is then inoculated with a cell suspension of the appropriate      test organism. Bacteria are grown in broth and fungi on agar slants for a      time and at a temperature appropriate to the species being tested. At the      end of the growth period, the broth is vortexed to disperse the cells. In      the case of fungi, the spores are harvested by pipetting water onto the      slant and dislodging the spores with a sterile loop. The cell/spore      suspension is standardized by controlling incubation time, temperature,      and the volume of the diluent. The suspension is then used to inoculate      the vessels containing the broth compound. The vessels are then incubated      at the appropriate temperature. After the incubation, the vessels are      examined for growth/no growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)      is defined as the lowest concentration of compound that results in      complete inhibition of growth of the test organism. </PAR><PAR>  The organisms tested to demonstrate biocidal activity include: </PAR><PA0>  BACTERIA: </PA0><PA1>  Pseudomonas fluorescens (Psfl) </PA1><PA1>  Pseudomonas aerugenosa (Psae) </PA1><PA1>  Escherichia coli (Ecol) </PA1><PA1>  Staphylococcus aureus (Saur) </PA1><PA0>  FUNGI: </PA0><PA1>  Aspergillus niger (Anig) </PA1><PA1>  Aureobasidium pullulans (Apul) </PA1><TBL>                TABLE 2                                                          ______________________________________                                         Biocidal Evaluation                                                            The Result of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Tests                     Compound                                                                               MIC (ppm)                                                              #       Psfl    Psae    Ecol  Saur  Anig  Apul                                 ______________________________________                                         1       andgt;500     250    andgt;500  andgt;500  andgt;500   63                                  2       andgt;500     250    andgt;500  andgt;500  andgt;500   63                                  3       andgt;500     250    andgt;500   125   andlt;4   andlt;4                                   4        125     125     250    16   andlt;4    8                                   5        125      16     125    8    andlt;4   andlt;4                                   6         50      25      50    50    6    3                                   7        125      31     125    63    31   31                                  8        250     125      63   andlt;4    andlt;4   andlt;4                                   9       andgt;500    andgt;500    andgt;500  andgt;500  andgt;250  --                                   10      andgt;500    andgt;500    andgt;500   andlt;4    andlt;4   andlt;4                                   11      andgt;500    andgt;500    andgt;500    8    andlt;4   andlt;4                                   12      andgt;100    andgt;100    andgt;100  andgt;100  andgt;100  100                                  13      andgt;100    andgt;100    andgt;100  andgt;100   100  andgt;100                                 14      andgt;100    andgt;100    andgt;100  andgt;100  andgt;100  andgt;100                                 15      andgt;100    andgt;100    andgt;100  andgt;100  andgt;100  andgt;100                                 16      andgt;100    andgt;100    andgt;100  andgt;100  andgt;100  andgt;100                                 ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAC>  EXAMPLE 3 </PAC><PAC>  In-Vitro Plant Fungicide Tests of Compounds </PAC><PAR>  The organisms employed in the test are: </PAR><PA0>  PYU Pythium ultimum (Oomycete) </PA0><PA0>  PHY Phytophthora capsici (Oomycete) </PA0><PA0>  PIR Piricularia oryzae (Ascomycete) </PA0><PA0>  HEL Cochliobolus sativus (Ascomycete) </PA0><PA0>  BOC Botrytis cinerea (Ascomycete) </PA0><PA0>  FUS Fusarium roseum (Ascomycete) </PA0><PA0>  SEP Septoria nodorum (Ascomycete) </PA0><PA0>  RHI Rhizoctonia solani (Basidiomycete) </PA0><PA0>  XAN Xanthomonas campestris (bacterium) </PA0><PAR>  Methods: </PAR><PAR>  1. Culture maintenance: Transfers in steps 1 and 2 are done in a laminar      flow hood. All 8 fungi and the bacterium used in this test are transferred      and maintained on potato dextrose agar plates each week (2      plates/organism). Organisms are used when they are the following ages: a.      1 week old: PYU, PHY, RHI; b. 2 weeks old: XAN, PIR, BOC, HEL, FUS, SEP,      COL, MON, CER, UST, ALT; c. 3 weeks old: PSH, VEN. Pythium ultimum and      Phytophthora capsici are transferred to asparagine-sucrose broth shake      cultures (ASB). Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium roseum, and Zanthomonas      campestris are mainted in yeast extract-dextrose broth (YDB) on a shaker.      Culture flasks are inoculated with 6 mycelial plugs each (except for      Pythium which is inoculated with only 3 plugs) taken from PDA plates. All      liquid shaker cultures are used after 2 days growth. </PAR><PAR>  2. Inoculum preparation. Conidia and mycelium from PIR, BOC, HEL, SEP, COL,      MON, CER, PSH, UST and ALT are lightly scraped off into YDB so that mostly      conidia are used as inoculum. The conidial suspension is strained through      a double layer of cheesecloth to remove mycelial clumps. One plate      produces enough conidia or mycelium to inoculate 100 ml of YDB. XAN broth      culture is poured (1 ml culture/100 ml broth) into YDB, PYU, PHY, RHI and      FUS cultures are ground up (2-3 5 second bursts in a blender) and all but      Pythium and Phytophthora are filtered through a double layer of sterile      cheesecloth to remove large mycelial clumps. Ten ml of the culture      solutions of R. solani and F. roseum are added to 90 ml of YSB and 10 ml      of the P. capsici is added to 90 ml ASB. Two ml of the culture solution of      P. ultimum is added to 98 ml of ASB. Care must be made not to      overinoculate (e.g. solutions should appear fairly clear to the eye, yet      when held up to light a faint cloudiness should be visible) or standards      will not behave properly. The inoculum mixtures are placed in microtiter      plates using a 12-tipped pipet. 175 .mu.l (single dose) or 100 .mu.l      (dose-response test) of inoculum broth is placed in each well of the      microtiter plates. The plates with inoculated media are placed in the      refrigerator overnight. There are two replications per treatment. </PAR><PAR>  3. Addition of compounds. This operation is carried out in a chemistry      hood. Six microtiter plates have 245 microliters of sterile water added to      their wells ahead of time. 10 Mg a.i. of the compounds are placed in 1 ml      1:1 acetone:methanol. 5 Microliters of this solution is pipetted into the      microtiter plates containing the sterile water according to the grid.      There are 45 compounds and 3 scattered control treatments per plate.

In tests on cereals (except for rice plants used for testing rice blast),      the plants were trimmed about 24 hours prior to the application of the      fungicide compound to provide a uniform plant height and to facilitate      uniform application of the compound and inoculation with the fungus. The      compounds were dissolved in a 2:1:1 mixture of water, acetone, and      methanol, sprayed onto the plants, allowed to dry (four to six hours), and      then the plants were inoculated with the fungus. Each test utilized      control plants which were sprayed with the water, acetone, and methanol      mixture and inoculated with the fungus. The remainder of the technique of      each of the tests is given below and the results are reported as percent      disease control (percentages of plants treated with the compounds of the      present invention lacking disease signs or symptoms compared to the      untreated control plants). </PAR><PAR>  Cucumber Downy Mildew (CDM): </PAR><PAR>  Pseudoperonospora cubensis was maintained on leaves of live Marketer      cucumber plants in a constant temperature room at 65.degree. F. to      75.degree. F. in humid air with moderate light intensity for 7 to 8 days.      A water suspension of the spores from infested leaves was obtained and the      spore concentration was adjusted to about 100,000 per ml of water. </PAR><PAR>  Marketer cucumber seedlings were inoculated by spraying the underside of      the leaves with a DeVilbiss atomizer until small droplets were observed on      the leaves. The inoculated plants were incubated in a mist chamber for 24      hours at about 70.degree. F. and then subsequently incubated for 6 to 7      days in a controlled temperature room under mist at 65.degree. F. to      75.degree. F. Seven days after inoculation, the percent disease control      was determined. </PAR><PAR>  Rice Blast (RB): </PAR><PAR>  Nato rice plants were inoculated with Piricularia oryzae (about 20,000      conidia per ml) by spraying the leaves and stems with an airbrush until a      uniform film of inoculum was observed on the leaves. The inoculated plants      were incubated in a humid environment (75.degree. F. to 85.degree. F.) for      about 24 hours, then placed in a greenhouse environment (70.degree. F. to      75.degree. F.). Seven to eight days after inoculation, the percent disease      control was determined. </PAR><PAR>  Rice Sheath Blight (RSB): </PAR><PAR>  Pellicularia filamentosa (f. sp. sasiki) was cultured on an autoclaved      mixture of crushed rice seeds and potato dextrose broth (100 gms of rice      seeds per 30 ml of potato dextrose broth) in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask.      After 10 days, the culture was blended in a blender to produce a uniform      inoculum. Approximately one teaspoon of inoculum was spread among Lebonnet      rice seedlings on the soil surface of each pot (3 inch diameter). The      inoculated seedlings were incubated for 5 days in a humidity cabinet      (85.degree. F. to 90.degree. F.). Percent disease controls were determined      immediately after removing the seedlings from the cabinet. </PAR><PAR>  Tomato Late Blight (TLB): </PAR><PAR>  Phytophthora infestans was cultured on four week old Pixie tomato plants in      a controlled environment room (65.degree. F. to 70.degree. F. and 100%      relative humidity). After storage, the spores were washed from the leaves      with water and dispersed by DeVilbiss atomizer over three week old Pixie      tomato plants which had been sprayed previously with experimental      fungicides. The inoculated plants were placed in a humidity cabinet at      70.degree. F. and constant mist for 24 hours for infection. The plants      were then moved to the controlled environment room as above and scored      after three more days incubation. Disease control levels were recorded as      percent control four days after inoculation and five days after spraying      the compounds. </PAR><PAR>  Wheat Powdery Mildew (WPM): </PAR><PAR>  Erysiphe graminis (f. sp. tritici) was cultured on Pennol wheat seedlings      in a controlled temperature room at 65.degree. F. to 75.degree. F. Mildew      spores were shaken from the culture plants onto Pennol wheat seedlings      which had been sprayed previously with the fungicide compound. The      inoculated seedlings were kept in a controlled temperature room at      65.degree. F. to 75.degree. F. and subirrigated. The percent disease      control was rated 8 to 10 days after the inoculation. </PAR><PAR>  Wheat Stem Rust (WSR): </PAR><PAR>  Puccinia graminis (f. sp. tritici Race 15B-2) was cultured on Wanzer wheat      seedlings for a period of 14 days in a greenhouse. A water suspension of      the spores from infested plants was obtained and the spore concentration      was adjusted to about 200,000 spores per ml of deionized water. Wanzer      wheat plants which had been previously treated with the fungicide      compounds were inoculated by applying the stem rust spore suspension,      until runoff, with a DeVilbiss atomizer at 5 lbs. per square inch air      pressure. After inoculation, the plants were placed in a humid environment      at approximately 75.degree. F. where they were exposed to 12 hours of      continuous darkness followed by a minimum of 3 to 4 hours of light having      an intensity of about 500 footcandles. The temperature in the chamber did      not exceed 85.degree. F. At the end of the light period, the plants were      placed in a greenhouse where they were permitted to grow for a period of      two weeks at which time the percent disease control was determined. </PAR><PAR>  Wheat Leaf Rust (WLR): </PAR><PAR>  Puccinia recondita (f. sp. tritici Races PKB and PLD) was cultured on seven      day old wheat (cultivar Fielder) over a 14 day period in the greenhouse.      Spores were collected from the leaves with a cyclone vacuum or by settling      on aluminum foil. The spores were cleaned by sieving through a 250 micron      opening screen and stored or used fresh. Storage employed sealed bags in      an Ultralow freezer. When stored, spores must be heat shocked for two      minutes at 40.degree. F. before use. A spore suspension is prepared from      dry uredia by adding 20 mg (9.5 million) per ml of Soltrol oil. The      suspension is dispensed into gelatin capsules (0.7 ml capacity) which      attach to the oil atomizers. One capsule is used per flat of twenty of the      two inch square pots of seven day old Fielder wheat. After waiting for at      least 15 minutes for the oil to evaporate from the wheat leaves, the      plants are placed in a dark mist chamber (18.degree.-20.degree.
