Background</ITAG>On January 11, 1989, the Commission published for public comment proposedregulations concerning certain ``hybrid'' instruments that combine elementsof commodity option contracts with debt or depository interests.\1\<NOTE/> The proposed rules would have established an exemption fromCFTC regulations under the CEA for certain hybrid instruments with limitedcommodity option components and a notice requirement applicable to specifiedexempt hybrid instruments. The Commission received letters from 31 commenterson the proposal: Four from futures exchanges; five from federal regulatoryagencies; six from industry associations; one from a lawyers' professionalassociation; two from oil companies; one from a law firm; one from theStudent Loan Marketing Association; one from the Federal National MortgageAssociation; five from broker-dealer and investment banking firms; threefrom banking organizations; one from a floor-trading and market-maker partnership;and one from the chairman of the Senate Resources Committee of the AlaskaState Legislature.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 54 FR 1128 (January 11, 1989); 54 FR 9460 (March 7, 1989)(extending the comment period to April 6, 1989).Most commenters supported the general objectives of the rulemaking (<T3>i.e.,</T3> providing clarity concerning the regulatory treatment ofhybrids) even though they differed with respect to the content of the release.Certain futures exchanges raised concerns that the rulemaking could impairthe Commission's exclusive jurisdiction. Others, however, concurred inthe Commission's approach, at least in part. Some exchanges also expressedconcern that unless the eligibility rules were made more stringent, theCommission's and the exchanges' regulatory efforts could be compromised.A contrary view was taken by representatives of the banking industry, whocontended that the Commission does not have jurisdiction over any securityor hybrid instrument offered by banks. Most of the remaining commenterssuggested revisions to clarify various provisions or to broaden their applicability.In this regard, commenters representing the securities and banking industriescontended that relief should be made available for any security (whetherregistered or exempt) or any depository instrument offered by federally-insuredbanks and savings and loans. Finally, the Department of the Treasury contendedthat the ambiguities in the CEA were too substantial to address on a case-by-casebasis and that a legislative solution was needed.Comments addressing specific rule provisions and an explanation of theCommission's revisions thereto are discussed in more detail below.Section 4c of the CEA grants the Commission the authority to permit theoffer and sale of commodity options without the requirement of exchangetrading under such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe.\2\<NOTE/> The exemptive rule discussed herein does not represent atransfer of regulatory responsibility for option instruments subject toanother regulatory scheme. Instead, the rule identifies certain debt, preferredequity or depository instruments in which the commodity option componentis not predominant and which meet performance criteria intended to assurethat Commission regulation in addition to that of another regulatory wouldbe unnecessary. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to retain thegeneral scheme of the exemptive rule as proposed, subject to modificationsdiscussed below which broaden and clarify certain aspects of the rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 7 U.S.C. 6c(b), 6c(c).The Commission did not intend to address the entire universe of hybridinstruments in the proposed rules but, rather, to establish an exemptiveframework applicable to categories of instruments in which issuers hadexpressed interest. As instruments are developed that do not fall withinthe criteria of the final rule, the Commission will continue to reviewtransactions on a case-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Substantive Revisions</ITAG>A. Section 34.1 Definitions1. <T3>Section 34.1(b) Hybrid instrument.</T3> As proposed, the definitionof hybrid instrument in andSection; 34.1(b) was drafted to include only debtor depository instruments with a commodity-dependent payment that is notseverable thereform. In the release accompanying the proposed rules, theCommission specifically requested comment as to the appropriateness ofincluding equity and other interests with commodity-dependent paymentsas hybrid instruments within the meaning of proposed Rule 34.1(b). \3\<NOTE/> A number of commenters who addressed the appropriatenessof expanding the definition of hybrid instruments to include equities supportedbroadening the definition to include such interests. Some commenters specificallyadvocated the inclusion of preferred stock, many forms of which, unlikecommon stock, appear to be readily analyzable under the exemptive framework.Based upon its evaluation of these comments, the Commission is revisingproposed andSection; 34.1(b) to include in the definition of hybrid instrumentspreferred equity interests that otherwise can meet the exemptive criteria.The Commission is limiting the category of included equity interests topreferred equity interests because such interests can closely resembledebt instruments. Although the Commission currently is expanding the definitionof hybrid instruments in the final rule only to the extent of includingthose preferred equities for which an implied option premium meeting theexemptive criteria can be calculated, this action does not foreclose laterconsideration of other forms of equity interests when the Commission hasgained further experience relevant to measurement of the commodity-dependentpayment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ 54 FR at 1134 n.26.The proposed definition of hybrid instrument also was limited to instrumentshaving a commodity component that is not severable from the instrumentas a whole. The definition was designed to make clear that hybrid instrumentsare interests that combine non-severable option or futures-like interestswith other interests.\4\<NOTE/> Several commenters suggested that the non-sever-ability conditionin andSection; 34.1(b) could be read as disallowing the exemption to instrumentswith detachable hybrid components, such as units or packages of debt securitiesthat incorporate hybrid instruments, even if such detachable componentsseparately meet the criteria of the exemption. The Commission did not,however, intend to prohibit the sale of detachable hybrid option instrumentssold in units with other interests, provided that the detachable hybridinstrument itself complies with the criteria for exemption under andSection;34.2. For purposes of analysis each detachable unit could itself constitutea hybrid instrument subject to the exemptive criteria. As noted in therelease accompanying the proposed rules, the Commission intended to excludefrom the hybrid instrument definition instruments in which the commoditycomponent is detachable from the non-commodity interest. The non-severabilitycondition would therefore render ineligible for exemption instruments which,for example, combined a commodity option component with a debt instrumentand permitted the option component to be detached at a later date (suchas a security and a detachable gold warrant).\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Although hybrid instruments may include futures-like interests,the exemption provided in Rule 34.2 only applies to hybrid instrumentswith option components.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Interpretative Letter No. 85-7, March 6, 1985 <T3>reprinted in </T3>[1984-1986 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)andpara; 22,727.2. <T3>Section 34.1(d) Commodity-dependent payment. </T3>Proposed andSection;34.1(d) defined ``commodity-dependent payment'' as any payment pursuantto a hybrid instrument ``resulting from indexing to, or calculation byreference to, the price of a commodity.'' One commenter questioned theapplicability of the definition to instruments that do not provide forperiodic interest payments, such as zero coupon debt securities, or instrumentsthat do not provide for cash returns, such as securities that permit orrequire an issuer to issue additional securities in lieu of cash interestpayments. The Commission does not construe ``payment'' as used in andSection;34.1(d) to be limited to periodic cash payments. The definitions of commodity-dependentand commodity-independent payments were intended to permit flexibilityin the design of hybrid instruments as long as the commodity componentis not severable from the instrument as a whole. Thus, as the Commissionnoted previously, a hybrid's commodity component includes that portionof the principal or interest, or both, that is indexed to the price ofa commodity; the commodity indexing mechanism need not be confined to anyparticular component of the instrument.\6\<NOTE/> Hybrid instruments in the form of zero coupon securitiesor instruments providing for other than cash returns (<T3>e.g.</T3>, interest paid by discount, premium or coupon) are eligiblefor the exemption. However, the definition of hybrid instrument is limitedto instruments containing a debt, depository, or preferred equity componentin addition to a commodity-dependent component. Although the rule doesnot address explicitly hybrid instruments containing more than one non-commoditycomponent, if the additional non-commodity component did not affect thecommodity price indexing of a hybrid and the instrument would otherwisesatisfy the exemptive criteria, the instrument may qualify for exemption.In any event, an instrument structured in a manner not contemplated bythe rule, such as an instrument containing a to-be-issued security, maybe eligible for exemption on a case-by-case basis. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See</T3> 54 FR at 1134.3. <T3>Section 34.1(e) Commodity option based payment. </T3>Proposed andSection;34.1(e) defines ``commodity option based payment'' to include any commodity-dependentpayment in which the commodity indexing results in the indexing of paymentsto commodity price changes either above or below the indexing referenceprice but not both. Several commenters contended that the definition of``commodity option based payment'' would unreasonably limit the scope ofthe exemption because hybrid instruments may include combinations of embeddedoptions that offer investors a collar-like return, that is, one limitedby both a floor and a ceiling. A collar which has its cap and floor significantlyout-of-the-money would have <T3>de facto </T3>futures-like indexing. The definition is designed toassure that exemptive relief is available only to hybrids the commoditycomponent of which is an option and to exclude hybrids with futures-likecommodity components.\7\<NOTE/> However, indexing with a collar where one of the implicitstrike prices is sufficiently near-the-money to create non-trivial optionindexing would be eligible for exemptive relief on a case-by-case basis.The Commission believes that the definition as drafted and the provisionfor case-by-case review appropriately deal with the necessity to distinguishbetween instruments which have <T3>de facto </T3>futures-like indexing from those with embedded options.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ It should be noted that option indexing either above orbelow an implicit strike price where the indexing is capped by an implicitshort option further out-of-the-money would meet the rule's definitionof an option based payment. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The Commission recognizes that, for example, the indexingof an instrument's coupon above and below a given interest rate subjectto a floor on the interest rate may be eligible for the exemption if thestrike price implied by the interest rate floor creates a significant optionindexing feature.4. <T3>Section </T3><T3>34.1(f) Implied option premium. </T3>Proposed andSection; 34.1(f) defines``implied option premium'' as the issue price of a hybrid instrument withcommodity based option payments less the present discounted value of theinstrument's commodity-independent payments.\9\<NOTE/> The proposed rule specifies that the discount rate to beused is ``the annual yield at the time of issuance for a comparable non-hybriddebt or depository instrument of a similar term issued by the same or acomparable issuer.'' Several commenters observed that a comparable instrumentmay not be available for these purposes on the issuance date and suggestedthat the Commission permit an estimated annual yield for a comparable non-hybridinstrument to be used. The Commission agrees that issuers should be permittedto use reasonable estimates of the annual yield on a comparable non-hybridinstrument in cases where an actual yield cannot be determined and hasamended andSection; 34.1(f) accordingly. See andSection; 34.1(f) <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ In response to suggestions that the Commission clarifythe factual assumptions of footnote 29 in 54 FR 1128, 1134 n.29 (January11, 1989), the Commission is restating the text of that footnote as follows:<ITAG tagnum="28">For example, consider the case of a note with a principal amount of$1000 and a maturity of 5 years that pays interest of 3% per annum, butalso pays an additional return when the price of crude oil is between $30to $50 per barrel. The note is issued at par when the price of crude oilis $20 per barrel. Under the definitions in the regulatory exemption, thecommodity-independent payments include the repayment of the original principalat maturity and the annual payment of interest of $30. The commodity-dependentreturn is the payment at maturity when the price of oil is between $30and $50 per barrel. This payment is equal to the price of crude oil multipliedby 100 barrels. The calculation of the implied option premium does notinvolve the commodity-dependent payment, only the commodity-independentpayments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Assume the issuer of the note would pay 9% per annum for a conventionaldebt instrument of the same maturity.

The Commission will accept the underwriter's good-faithestimate of what the issuer's debt rate would be for a comparable fixedincome instrument payment be indexed to the price of a commodity on nomore than a one-to-one basis. This instrument would fail such a requirementsince at issuance the price of crude oil of $20 and the principal amountis $1000 so that one-to-one indexing would be on 50 barrels (</ITAG><T3>i.e., </T3>$1,000/$20=50). Several commenters also requested that the Commission clarify the timeat which the implied option premium is to be calculated for purposes ofandSection; 34.1(f). One commenter noted that in a typical underwritten offeringof securities, the relevant time for the premium calculation would be thetime at which the offering is priced and the underwriting agreement issigned or released from escrow (the process being similar for private placementsand ``best efforts'' offerings). This point in time was suggested in orderto enable issuers to determine the exemption is available at the time theinstruments are sold as opposed to when they are actually issued by theunderwriter. The Commission agrees and confirms that the relevant timefor making the andSection; 34.1(f) implied option premium calculation iswhen the instrument is priced. For instruments that are offered on a continuousbasis but are frequently repriced based upon market conditions, the Commissionbelieves that the andSection; 34.1(f) premium test should be met each timefirm prices are fixed. One commenter suggested that the Commission clarify how the definitionwould apply to an instrument in which the principal amount increases ordecreases during the term of the instrument, which pays a higher couponto compensate investors for the lack of a final maturity date, or whichis sold at a deep discount to par. In general, the implied option premiumdefinition measures the difference between the market price of the instrumentat issuance and the value of the instrument without its commodity-dependentoption payments. This difference is an approximation of the value of thecommodity-dependent payments. In cases in which the principal amount isindexed to a commodity price, the gain or loss resulting from such indexingrepresents the commodity-dependent component of the instrument. Cases inwhich interest payments are based upon a variable principal should alsopose no calculation problem since the effect of such principal indexingwill be reflected in the issue price of the instrument. The concerns raisedby one commenter with respect to payment of higher coupons to compensateinvestors for the lack of a final maturity date suggest an instrument designwhich has not yet been presented to the Commission and which is not contemplatedby the exemptive rule. If the instrument is indexed in an option-like manner,the coupons generally would be expected to be lower for the option purchaserthan the straight debt rate and a maturity date would be required to enablethe buyer to assess the value of the instrument. The same commenter also inquired about the treatment of discount instrumentsunder the implied option premium definition. Discount instruments are adequatelyaddressed in the definition of the implied option premium as the issueprice used in the calculations will reflect the discount. B. Section <T3>34.2 Option Hybrid Exemption</T3>1. <T3>Section </T3><T3>34.2(a) General. </T3>As proposed, Rule andSection; 34.2(a) would haveprovided an exemption from Commission regulation applicable to hybrid instrumentsfor which an appropriate degree of federal oversight exists, conditionedupon compliance with one of a number of alternative performance criteriadesigned to provide indicia of the financial soundness of such transactions.Extensive comments were received concerning the scope of the exemptionas delimited by the criteria set forth in andSection; 34.2(a)(1). 2. <T3>Section </T3><T3>34.2(a)(1) Certain exempt securities.</T3>As proposed, andSection; 34.2(a)(1)would have made the exemption available to a class of hybrid instrumentswith limited option components subject to the applicability of an alternateregulatory framework, as specified in the proposed rule, and to compliancewith one of a number of alternative performance criteria. Included in theclass of eligible hybrid instruments were certain securities exempt fromthe registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. A number ofcommenters stated that the categories of exempt securities specified inthe proposed rule were too narrow and that certain of these categoriescould be interpreted too restrictively. Commenters proposed various additionsto the list of eligible securities set forth in proposed andSection; 34.2(a)(1).These suggestions, certain of which the Commission is incorporation inthe final rule, are discussed below. a. <T3>Securities which are deemed to be exempt securities by federal statute.</T3>Several commenters stated that proposed andSection;34.2(a)(1) shouldbe expanded to include securities which are, by federal statute, deemedto be exempt securities for purposes of the federal securities laws. Examplesof statutes that provide for such exemption include the legislation establishingthe Student Loan Marketing Association, 20 U.S.C. 1087-2(1), the FederalNational Mortgage Association, 12 U.S.C. 1723(c), the Federal Home LoanMortgage Corporation, 12 U.S.C. 1455(g), and the Financing Corporation,12 U.S.C. 1441(e)(9). These commenters essentially contended that suchexempt securities are analogous to the type of exempt security describedin proposed andSection;34.2(a)(1)(iii) (exempt securities under section 3(a)(2)of the Securities Act of 1933 issued or guaranteed by the United Statesor any state). In addition, one federally chartered corporation statedthat providing eligibility under the rule for its securities would be necessaryto preserve that corporation's competitive position in capital market transactionsand thereby facilitate performance of its Congressionally mandated functions.While this commenter noted that a federal statute makes its securitiesexempt securities for purposes of SEC regulations, it nonetheless questionedwhether as a matter of statutory interpretation these securities wouldbe deemed to be exempt securities under Section 3(a)(2) of the SecuritiesAct of 1933 for purposes of proposed andSection;34.2.Proposed andSection;34.2(a)(1)(iii) was intended to include securities whichare deemed to be exempt by statute, such as those listed above. However,to eliminate any potential ambiguities, the Commission has revised proposedandSection;34.2(a)(1)(iii) to clarify that instruments issued or guaranteedas to principal or interest by a corporation, the securities of which aredesignated by statute to constitute exempt securities, are eligible forthe exemption pursuant to andSection;34.2(a)(1)(iii).b. <T3>Life insurance products exempt under section 3(a)(2) of the SecuritiesAct of 1933. </T3>Proposed andSection;34.2(a)(1)(ii) would have made eligiblefor the exemption securities that constitute exempt securities under Sections3(a)(3) and 3(a)(8) of the Securities Act of 1933. This provision wouldhave included, among other things, insurance policies and annuity contractssubject to state regulation and exempt from registration under Section3(a)(8) of the Securities Act of 1933.\1\\0\<NOTE/> In proposing this provision, the Commission noted that thisexemptive approach was:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\This exemption addresses only insurance contracts andannuities that are not otherwise excluded from Commission jurisdiction.<ITAG tagnum="20">based both upon the character of such interests as primarily non-investmentvehicles as well upon the existence of a state regulatory structure applicableto a field historically viewed as sufficiently addressed by state regulation.\1\\1\</ITAG><NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\54 FR at 1135 n.30.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">An insurance industry trade group stated that the Commission shouldmodify proposed andSection;34.2(a)(1) to include the full range of insuranceproducts exempt under the Securities Act of 1933 and thereby fulfill completelythe Commission's previously expressed intention to include life insuranceand annuity contracts within the proposed exemptive framework.\1\\2\<NOTE/> In this regard, the commenter noted that life insurance andannuity contracts that fulfill the requirements of Section 3(a)(2) of theSecurities Act of 1933 ``possess indicia of soundness'' (such as comprehensivestate regulation) warranting their treatment as eligible exempt instruments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\For example, Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of1933 exempts any security arising out of a contract issued by an insurancecompany used to fund certain stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing planswhich meet the requirements for qualification under specified provisionsof the Internal Revenue Code.The Commission agrees and is revising andSection; 34.2(a)(1) by adding anew paragraph to include any securities issued by an insurance companythat constitute exempt securities under Section 3(a)(2) of the SecuritiesAct of 1933. <T3>See</T3> andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(v).c. <T3>Exempt securities under Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act: Inclusionof other federally insured institutions.</T3> In proposed andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(iv),the Commission included, as potentially eligible for the exemption, securitiesexempt under Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and issued orguaranteed by a bank that is a member of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation (FDIC). Several commenters, including the Federal Home LoanBank Board and the staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem (Federal Reserve), contended that restricting qualifying bank depositoryinstruments to those issued by members of the FDIC inappropriately omittedinstruments issued by other federally insured institutions such as savingsand loan associations and credit unions. These commenters perceived nodistinguishing characteristics of the applicable regulatory system thatwould warrant such differential treatment and noted that, if uncorrected,this difference in treatment would place other federally insured institutionsat a competitive disadvantage to FDIC-insured institutions. Based uponan evaluation of these comments, the Commission has revised proposed andSection;34.2(a)(1)(iv) by replacing the phrase ``FDIC-insured institution'' withthe phrase ``financial institution that is insured by a United States governmentagency or United States chartered corporation.'' andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(iv).See also andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(vii) and andSection; 34.2(a)(3)(iv).Those commenters who urged that federally insured savings and loans beaccorded equal treatment with FDIC-insured institutions requested thatsecurities issued by such organizations that are exempt under Section 3(a)(5)of the Securities Act of 1933 be included as eligible exempt securities.The Commission is revising the final rules to accommodate those securitiesexempt under Section 3(a)(5) issued by federally insured financial institutions.andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(iv).d. <T3>Exempt securities under Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933that are issued by foreign banks licensed in the U.S.</T3> Several commenters(including the Institute of International Bankers (IIB), the Federal Reserveand a law firm) suggested that the exemption should be made available tothe uninsured domestic offices of foreign banks. These commenters notedthat most U.S. branch offices of foreign banks are not FDIC-insured becausethey are not engaged in retail deposit-taking activities requiring federaldeposit insurance within the meaning of the International Banking Act of1978 (IBA) and implementing regulations of the FDIC.\13\<NOTE/> Moreover, it was noted that U.S. agency offices of foreignbanks are not eligible for FDIC insurance because they are empowered onlyto issue non-depository debt obligations to (and maintain credit balancesfor) citizens or residents of the United States. Both the IIB and the FederalReserve contended that the uninsured status of most foreign banks and consequentunavailability of the proposed exemption would place such foreign banks'U.S. operations at a competitive disadvantage to FDIC-insured banks andwould be inconsistent with the principle of parity of treatment betweenforeign and domestic banks under the IBA.\14\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>See</T3> 12 U.S.C. 3102(b), 3104 (1982); 12 CFR 28.8(a), 346.5 and346.6 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ <T3>See</T3> U.S.C. 3102(b) which provides in part: ``In establishing andoperating a Federal branch or agency, a foreign bank shall be subject tosuch rules, regulations, and orders as the Comptroller considers appropriateto carry out this section * * * Except as otherwise specifically providedin this chapter or in rules, regulations, or orders adopted by the Comptrollerunder this section, operations of a foreign bank at a Federal branch oragency shall be conducted with the same rights and privileges as a nationalbank at the same location and shall be subject to all the same duties,restrictions, penalties, liabilities, conditions, and limitations thatwould apply under the National Bank Act to a national bank.* * *''The Federal Reserve noted that foreign banks are entitled to be treatedequally with domestic banks under the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade and United States trade laws and that the IBA provides for equaltreatment for the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. Commentersrepresented that disparity of treatment under the hybrid exemptive ruleis unwarranted, particularly since the uninsured U.S. offices of foreignbanks would be subject to supervision by U.S. bank regulatory authorities,as well as by the regulatory authorities of their home jurisdiction, tothe same extent generally as insured institutions. In this regard, theIIB noted that all U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks are subjectto essentially the same statutory and regulatory restrictions, reportingobligations, and examination requirements that are applicable to U.S.-charteredcommercial banks. In the case of a federally licensed uninsured branchor agency of a foreign bank, the IBA requires that regulations issued bythe Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve concerning suchbranches or agencies track the regulation of national banks.\15\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>Id.</T3>The Commission believes that the principles of parity of treatment containedin the IBA and other relevant laws and treaties warrant an accommodationin the exemptive framework applicable to hybrid option instruments to addressthe special status of domestic \16\<NOTE/> uninsured offices of foreign banks. Accordingly, the Commissionis amending its proposal to permit the uninsured U.S. offices of foreignbanks that are subject to federal bank regulatory supervision to be eligiblefor the exemption. See andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(iv) and andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(vii)discussed below. The Commission is limiting such relief to federally supervisedinstitutions, since such relief will remove any disparity in treatmentas between federally regulated domestic and foreign banks. Since the ruledoes not extend eligibility for the exemption to securities offered bysolely state supervised institutions (<T3>i.e.</T3>, state chartered, and not federally insured), this limitationcreates no inequality of treatment between foreign and U.S. banks. However,the Commission invites uninsured state-chartered foreign bank branchesand agencies who wish to offer option hybrids to apply for no-action reliefon a case-by-case basis.\17\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ The IIB noted that the FDIC-insurance criterion in theproposed exemption could, in conjunction with a technical reading of theFederal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), allow all non-U.S. offices of a foreignbank having an insured U.S. branch to be eligible under the exemption.The IIB noted that Section 3 of the FDIA defines the term ``insured bank''to include ``a foreign bank having an insured branch.'' 12 U.S.C. 1813(h)(1982). Thus, read technically, all offices of a foreign bank having aninsured U.S. branch, including not only the uninsured offices of such abank located in the United States, but also all non-U.S. offices of sucha bank, could rely on the exemption to issue hybrid instruments in theUnited States.<ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission has replaced references to FDIC-insured banks withreferences to U.S. financial institutions insured by a U.S. Governmentagency or chartered corporation. It is the Commission's intention thatonly a domestic issuer which is subject to federal insurance be eligibleunder the federally-insured provisions of the exemption. Thus, a non-insuredbranch or agency of a foreign bank having an insured U.S. branch wouldnot be eligible for the exemption but would be an eligible issuer onlyif it is licensed under U.S. law and appropriately regulated, supervisedand examined by U.S. banking authorities. See, e.g. andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(iv).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Review of foreign bank branches and agency offeringson a case-by-case basis, followed by more generalized treatment, is consistentwith the SEC's practice with respect to foreign branch and agency offeringsunder Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. <T3>See</T3> SEC Release No. 33-6661, 39-2038, 51 FR 34462 (September 29,1986).The Commission is therefore revising proposed andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(iv)to make eligible for the exemption securities exempt under section 3(a)(2)of the Securities Act of 1933 that are issued or guaranteed by a U.S. branchor agency of a foreign bank that is licensed under the laws of the UnitedStates and that is supervised by federal banking authorities. Section 34.2(a)(1)(iv).See also andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(vii).e. <T3>Securities exempt under section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.</T3>Proposed andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(v) would have made eligible for the exemptionsecurities that are exempt from registration pursuant to 17 CFR 230.506.(SEC Regulation D). Numerous commenters stated that andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(v)should be expanded to include securities exempt from registration undersection 4(2) of the Securities Act, without regard to whether the securitiesare offered within a Regulation D safe harbor. These commenters noted thatmany financial institutions offer securities under section 4(2) of theSecurities Act without reliance upon Regulation D. For example, a securitiesindustry trade association represented that most privately-placed securitiesare offered pursuant to the statutory exemptions from registration of theSecurities Act of 1933 without reliance upon SEC Regulation D. The SECrepresented that a large number, if not a majority, of private placementsrely solely on the section 4(2) exemption of the Securities Act of 1933and not on Rule 506.\18\<NOTE/> These commenters noted that offerings of securities undersection 4(2) are exempt only from the registration requirements of section5 of the Securities Act but that transactions in such securities are notexempt from the antifraud, civil liability or other provisions of the federalsecurities laws, applicable state securities laws or rules of the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers, Inc. The securities industry trade associationand a broker-dealer also noted that use of the Regulation D exemption generallyoccurs only where unaccredited investors are taking part in the initialoffering. Thus, the commenters argued that offerings under section 4(2)of the Securities Act of 1933 may be made to a more restricted class ofinvestors than offerings under Regulation D. In addition, a bar associationnoted that because many novel financial products are offered under section4(2), a failure to include such offerings in andSection; 34.2 could retardproduct development and innovation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ The SEC previously has stated that ``in general, privateplacements with large institutions are made in reliance on section 4(2)rather than on the safe harbor provisions of Regulation D.'' SEC Release33-6806, 53 FR 44016, 44025 (November 1, 1988) (proposed Rule 144A).The Commission has determined to reformulate andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(v) topermit securities offered pursuant to section 4(2) of the Securities Actof 1933 to be eligible for exemption. As commenters indicated that privateplacements pursuant to Section 4(2) of the 1933 Act generally would bemade to a subset of permissible Rule 506 purchasers, the revised provisionshould not restrict the scope of private placements under existing practiceand will be consistent with the Commission's objective of limiting eligibilityto instruments not offered to the general public.3. <T3>Section 34.2(a)(1)_Time deposits.</T3>a. <T3>Time deposits offered by non-FDIC insured institutions and at certainuninsured branches and agencies of foreign banks. </T3>Proposed andSection;34.2(a)(1)(vi) would have made eligible for the exemption time deposits,within the meaning of 12 CFR 204.2(c)(1), which are offered by a bank thatis a member of the FDIC and marketed and sold directly to a customer orthrough a broker registered in accordance with Section 15 of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934 and applicable regulations.As noted above, several commenters objected to the exclusion from eligibilityunder andSection; 34.2(a)(1) of institutions that were not members of theFDIC but that otherwise were subject to federal insurance, such as federallyinsured savings and loan institutions. For the reasons previously discussed,the Commission is revising proposed andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(vi), as well asandSection; 34.2(a)(1)(iv), to extend eligibility for the exemption to otherfederally insured institutions.Similarly, also for the reasons previously discussed, the Commission isrevising proposed andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(vi) to extend the exemption to depositsat the uninsured branches or agencies of U.S. supervised foreign banks.Section 34.2(a)(1)(vii) (revision and redesignation of proposed andSection;34.2(a)(1)(vi)).b. <T3>Time deposits under 12 CFR 204.2(c)(1): Expansion of category. </T3>Asnoted above, proposed andSection; 34.4(a)(1)(vi) would have established eligibilityfor the exemption for time deposits within the meaning of 12 CFR 204.2(c)(1).Several commenters, including an association of banks and the Federal Reserve,contended that limiting such eligibility to time deposits under 12 CFR204.2(c)(1) was too restrictive and omitted other forms of bank accountsthat could be characterized as hybrids. These commenters noted, for example,that the proposed rule did not cover demand deposits, demand notes, NOWaccounts and other liabilities that constitute transaction accounts under12 CFR 204.2. The Federal Reserve noted that the regulatory distinctionbetween time deposits and transaction accounts, from which funds may bewithdrawn at any time without notice or penalty, is made primarily formonetary policy purposes and should not be material for purposes of theproposed exemption.\19\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ For example, the Federal Reserve noted that transactionaccounts are subject to higher reserve requirements than time deposits.See 12 CFR 204.2(c), 204.2(e) and 204.9(a)(1).The Commission is revising proposed andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(vi) to includedemand deposits, time deposits and transaction accounts within the meaningof 12 CFR 204.2(b)(1), (c)(1) and (e), respectively. andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(vii)(redesignation and revision of proposed andSection; 34.2(a)(1)(vi). However,while such accounts will be potentially eligible for the exemption, theconventional structure of some such accounts, for example demand deposits,as deposits without a fixed maturity or interest payment, may not be readilyaccommodated under the final exemptive rule.4. <T3>Section 34.2(a)(2) Implied option premium limitation. </T3>Under proposedandSection; 34.2(a)(2), the commodity component of exempted instruments wouldhave been subject to a maximum implied option premium of 40% of the issueprice of the instrument. As previously noted, the term ``implied optionpremium'' would have been defined in andSection; 34.1(f) as the issue priceof the instrument less the present, or discounted, value of the instrument'scommodity-independent payments.\20\<NOTE/> Under this standard, instruments that have implied optionpremiums greater than 40% of the instrument's total price at issuance wouldbe ineligible for exemption under the proposed regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ <T3>See </T3>54 FR at 1135 n.29.Many commenters opposed this criterion. Several commenters objected tothe use of a quantitative standard which could result in different permissibleimplied option premiums depending upon transitory market conditions. Itwas also noted that calculating the implied option premium depends upona determination of the commodity-independent payments of the hybrid instrument,an amount which may not be readily ascertainable due to the absence ofa final maturity date, variation in the principal amount of the instrumentover its term, or other factors. For example, one commenter noted thatdue to possible fluctuations in the discount rate, an issuer may be unableto predict whether an identical hybrid instrument, issued shortly afteran exempted instrument, would be exempt. The implied option premium testis applied at one point in time, at pricing of the instrument. At thattime, the issue price and discount rate should be calculable. More generally,it is in the nature of a hybrid instrument to introduce temporal commoditypricing into debt, preferred equity, or depository instruments. Commoditypricing can differ greatly over time; a market may be inverted at one pointin time and be a carrying charge market at another point in time. Thus,the reflection of such variables in regulatory standards applicable tohybrid instruments is appropriate. The Federal Reserve contended that the maximum implied option premium standardcould impair legitimate transactions, such as foreign currency depositsat U.S. banks paying interest at the prevailing rates for such currency.The Federal Reserve noted that this concern is particularly relevant todeposits in currencies on which lower interest rates tend to be paid, suchas Japanese yen. The implied option premium standard should afford substantialflexibility in the construction of foreign currency linked accounts.  The Federal Reserve also commented that the criterion appears to favorinstruments with imbedded options that are ``out of the money'' ratherthan ``in'' or ``at the money.'' However, the criterion does not ``favor''instruments that are out-of-the-money but simply puts a maximum limit atissuance on the amount of overall premium that may be embedded in an instrument.To the extent that more commodity units could be effectively indexed without-of-the-money options as compared to in-the-money options, this simplyreflects the lower price, other things being equal, of the former. Thissame principle governs any valuation of options, including exchange-tradedoptions. Finally, a number of commenters noted that if the Commission expanded thelist of instruments eligible for the exemption to include broader groupsof deposits under 12 CFR Part 204, it may not be possible to calculatethe implied option premium of some instruments, for example, a demand depositlacking a fixed maturity date. The Commission believes, however, that tothe extent the option value can be effectively estimated, such an instrumentmay qualify for exemptive relief. 5. <T3>Section 34.2(a)(3)(i) and (iv) Rating. </T3>The Commission proposedto restrict the availability of exemptive relief under proposed andSection;34.2(a)to transactions satisfying one of five alternate performance criteria designedto provide assurance of the ability of the offeror to satisfy its obligationsunder the hybrid instrument. Proposed andSection;34.2(a)(3)(i) would have provided as an alternative performancecriterion that the instrument be rated in one of the three highest categoriesby at least two nationally recognized investment organizations. A numberof commenters argued that requiring more than one rating would impose anunnecessary expense upon option hybrid issuers. An investment bank alsocommented that the requirement that the rating be in one of the three highestcategories was unduly restrictive, since this requirement would exclude,for example, securities rated A (<T3>i.e., </T3>under a rating system in which AAA, AA+ and AA are the threehighest ratings), which are considered to be of investment grade. The investmentbank noted that investment grade securities are eligible for investmentby most fund managers and fiduciaries and recommended that the criterionbe revised to require only that the instrument be rated investment grade.\2\\1\<NOTE/> The Commission has revised the final rule to provide thatrating of the instrument by a nationally recognized investment rating organizationin one of the four highest categories satisfies the performance requirement.See andSection;34.2(a)(3)(i). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\Several commenters noted that investment grade wouldinclude instruments rated Baa or better under one grading system. A life insurance industry trade association stated that some life insurancecompanies are not evaluated by investment rating organizations becausethey do not issue debt or equity instruments. Nonetheless, the trade associationnoted that such life insurance companies are evaluated by nationally recognizedfinancial rating organizations such as A.M. Best Company or Moody's InvestorServices. The Commission believes that with respect to insurance companieswhich have not been rated by an investment rating organization, the andSection;34.2(a)(3)(i)criterion may be fulfilled by an equivalent rating by a nationally recognizedfinancial rating organization. Proposed andSection;34.2(a)(3)(iv) would have provided as an alternativeperformance criterion that other outstanding debt instruments offered bythe same bank have been rated in one of the three highest categories byat least two nationally recognized investment rating organizations. Severalcommenters noted that while proposed andSection;34.2(a)(3)(i) (rating ofinstrument) would be available both to bank and non-bank issuers, proposedandSection;34.2(a)(3)(iv) (rating of other outstanding instrument) wouldbe available only to banks. These commenters advocated that all issuers,not only banks, be permitted to employ this performance criterion. In particular,several commenters noted that such flexibility would be most importantfor issuers of private placements, where the instruments usually are notrated but where the issuers' other outstanding debt frequently has receivedsuch ratings. The Commission agrees that andSection;34.2(a)(3)(iv) appropriately may beextended to non-bank issuers. Therefore, the Commission has revised andSection;34.2(a)(3)(iv)by incorporating it into andSection;34.2(a)(3)(i). The Commission also hasclarified the revised rule to specify that where the performance criterionrelied upon is the rating of an instrument other than the hybrid instrument,the rated instrument should be one of comparable seniority to the hybridinstrument. In addition, for the reasons discussed above, only one investmentrating by a qualified rating agency will be required. See andSection;34.2(a)(3)(i).6. <T3>Section 34.2(a)(3)(ii) Net worth. </T3>Proposed andSection;34.2(a)(3)(ii)provided a $100 million net worth alternative performance criterion. Severalcommenters suggested that the Commission make clear that the net worthcalculation should be measured at only one date, the date the terms ofthe hybrid instrument are fixed. As discussed below, the Commission believesthat, with the exception of cover, compliance with the performance standardshould be determined at the time at which the instrument is issued. Onecommenter suggested that the net worth calculation should be derived fromthe issuer's most recent balance sheet, prepared in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting principles or regulatory accounting principles. TheCommission concurs in this view. 7. <T3>Section 34.2(a)(3)(iii) Cover or letter of credit. </T3>Proposed andSection;34.2(a)(3)(iii)would have provided as an alternative performance criterion that the issuermaintain cover, consisting of the physical commodity or futures, forwardor option contracts for the commodity, equal to the amount of its commitmentsto deliver, to take delivery of, or to pay the cash value of, the commodity(or a change in the price of the commodity) that is the subject of thecommodity component of the instrument. A number of commenters stated that the proposed cover requirement appearedto restrict unduly the type of permissible cover arrangements and shouldbe modified to permit other forms of cover. In this regard, some commentersnoted that in the Advance Notice, futures or options on futures were notintended as the exclusive means of cover.\2\\2\<NOTE/> Commenters suggested, for example, that customized agreementsor letters of credit might be used. Others raised questions concerningwhether physical inventory or reserves of the physical commodity to whichthe instrument is indexed would constitute acceptable cover. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\<T3>See </T3>52 FR 47022, 47025-26 (December 11, 1987). The Commission has made several clarifying changes in andSection;34.2(a)(3)(iii)to address the forms of permissible cover. First, the Commission has revisedthe provision to make express reference to letters of credit as an alternativeto cover.\2\\3\<NOTE/> Second, in response to the requests of various commentersthat contractual interests in the relevant commodity be considered acceptablecover, the Commission has revised andSection;34.2(a)(3)(iii) to make clearthat interests in the relevant commodity that qualify as cover under CommissionRegulation 1.17(j) also would qualify as cover under the exemptive rule.The Commission has retained in the definition of cover specific referencesto the physical commodity that is deliverable under the hybrid instrumentor whose price is the reference price for the instrument, as well as futures,forward, and option contracts. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\Although letters of credit may be used as cover forpurposes of Rule 34.2, they do not constitute qualifying capital for purposesof calculating net capital under Commission Rule 1.17. <T3>See </T3>CFR 1.17(c)(3)(i) (1988). 8. <T3>Section 34.2(a)(3)(v). </T3>Proposed andSection;34.2(a)(3)(v) would haveprovided as an alternative performance requirement that the instrumentbe subject to insurance by the FDIC. In accordance with the revision ofandSection;34.2(a)(iii) discussed above, the Commission is expanding thisperformance criterion to include other forms of federal insurance. In addition,an association of banks contended that the insurance provision should bemodified to specify that the institution, not the instrument, be federallyinsured. As deposits in an FDIC-insured bank are insured to $100,000, somecommenters contended that the proposed formulation makes it unclear whetheran instrument with a face value in excess of $100,000 would be deemed tobe ``subject to insurance'' for purposes of the rule. The Commission intendedthe phrase ``subject to insurance,'' as used in the proposed rule, to meanthat the issuing bank is insured and that, subject to the applicable ceilingon coverage, the hybrid instrument would be covered by such insurance.The Commission did not intend to disallow exemptive relief to instrumentswith face values in excess of $100,000. The Commission has revised andSection;34.2(a)(3)(iv)(redesignation and revision of proposed andSection;34.2(a)(3)(v)) to clarifythis issue. Finally, one commenter urged that proposed andSection;34.2(a)(3)(v) be revisedto permit U.S. offices of foreign banks that are licensed and supervisedby U.S. authorities to meet this alternative performance criterion solelyby virtue of such a foreign bank's status as a U.S. licensed bank. Whilethe Commission has revised the proposed rules to make clear that hybridinstruments issued by U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks may qualifyfor the exemption, the Commission does not believe that revision of proposedandSection;34.2(a)(3)(v) in the manner suggested is appropriate. Were foreignstatus alone sufficient to satisfy the performance requirement, uninsuredU.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks would be subject to no performancerequirement while U.S. banks would, like all other U.S. issuers, be requiredto satisfy one of the alternate performance criteria. As the Commissionhas made clear above, it has revised the final rules to reflect the principleof parity of treatment established in the IBA. However, it does not believethat foreign banks should receive a waiver of performance requirementsfully applicable to domestic banks, particularly as such requirements maybe satisfied by one of several alternative methods.\2\\4\<NOTE/> Thus, the Commission believes that, as revised, its finalrules treat the uninsured U.S. offices of foreign banks comparably withU.S. banks. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\For example, such branches and agencies may rely uponthe rating criterion of andSection;32.4(a)(3)(i). 9. Section 34.2(a)(3) <T3>Other comments. </T3>A number of commenters questioned whether theperformance requirement set forth in proposed andSection;34.2(a)(3) was intendedto continue for the full term to maturity of the instrument or to be applicableonly at the time of issuance of the instrument and objected to the formerinterpretation. Some commenters suggested that if satisfaction of one ofthe alternate performance criteria is required throughout the term of theinstrument such a requirement may make it difficult for issuers to obtainopinions of counsel that registered securities will be legally issued.Moreover, these commenters represented that it would be unlikely for coverto be available on acceptable terms for longer maturity instruments. Finally,other commenters requested that the Commission clarify the consequencesof a subsequent lack of compliance with a performance criterion.   The Commission agrees that, with the exception of the letter of creditor cover criterion, compliance with the alternate performance criteriais properly determined at the time the instrument is issued and that theexempt status of the instrument is not affected by subsequent events, <T3>e.g.,</T3> a decline in net worth, that result in noncompliance withthe performance criterion initially relied upon. This clarification reflectsthe fact that the performance criteria are not designed to guarantee orassure the issuer's performance of its obligations under the hybrid instrumentbut only to provide indicia of the issuer's ability to satisfy its obligationsunder the hybrid instrument. The Commission believes, however, that useof letters of credit or cover to satisfy the performance standard is meaningfulonly to the extent that such arrangements continue throughout the termof the instrument. Compliance with the performance criteria other thanletters of credit and cover, <T3>e.g.</T3>, net worth, is less likely to vary substantially over time.As a general matter, the issuer's failure to maintain compliance with theletter of credit or cover criterion throughout the term of the hybrid instrumentshould not affect the rights of purchasers who would be considered bonafide purchasers of such instruments. The Commission will continue to evaluatethis criterion based upon further experience with the exemptive rule. 10. <T3>Section 34.2(a)(4)_Marketing prohibition.</T3> Proposed andSection;34.2(a)(4)would have precluded marketing of the instrument as a futures contractor a commodity option, or, except to the extent necessary to describe theinstrument or to comply with applicable disclosure requirements, as havingthe characteristics of a futures contract or a commodity option. Severalcommenters contended that this requirement was vague and could discouragefull disclosure. Other commenters recommended that the Commission makeclear that this marketing restriction applies only to the initial issuanceof the hybrid instrument and sales literature prepared by the issuer andnot to material prepared by the underwriter. One commenter suggested thatin order to prevent circumvention of this restriction through collusionbetween the issuer and underwriter, the issuer should be required to obtainfrom the underwriter a representation that the hybrid instrument in questionwill be marketed in accordance with the andSection;34.2(a)(4) marketing restriction. The Commission believes that proposed andSection;34.2(a)(4) adequately describedthe type or representations that should be precluded as inconsistent withthe character of an exempted instrument while preserving the ability ofissuers to describe the instrument accurately. By making clear that issuersmay describe the operation of the instrument and otherwise make such disclosuresas are required by applicable disclosure requirements, the Commission believesthat the rule as proposed adequately specifies the conduct prohibited. As some commenters suggested, the marketing prohibition could be negatedto the extent that persons involved in marketing and sales activity ignorethe requirements of the rule. Therefore, the issuer must take reasonablesteps to assure that the marketing restriction is complied with by otherparties responsible for the initial marketing of the instrument.  11. <T3>Section 34.2(b) Case-by-case additional relief.</T3> Proposed andSection;34.2(b)stated that the Commission may, upon written petiton, grant such furtherexemptions with respect to hybrid instruments as it determines are notcontrary to the public interest. Several commenters suggested that thereference to ``hybrid instrument'' should be deleted in order to allowthe provision to address instruments that do not come within the meaningof that term as defined in proposed andSection;34.1(b). However, the Commissionbelieves that the relief available under andSection;34.2(b) is appropriatelylimited to hybrid instruments inasmuch as the Commission retains exemptiveauthority under Rule 32.4(b) to grant exemptive relief with respect tooptions transactions in general, subject to certain exceptions set forthin that rule.\2\\5\<NOTE/> In addition, of course, issuers may seek other relief (<T3>e.g.,</T3> ``no-action'' letters) for instruments that warrant particularizedtreatment but do not fall within the definition hybrid instrument.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\Commission Rule 32.4(b), 17 CFR 32.4(b) provides that:``The Commission may, by order, upon written request or upon its own motion,exempt any other person, either unconditionally or on a temporary or otherconditional basis, from any provisions of this Part, other than andSection;andSection;32.2,32.8 and 32.9, if it finds, in its discretion, that it would not be contraryto the public interest to grasnt such exemption.''  As suggested by one commenter, the Commission wishes to make clear thatthe exemptive rule is not exclusive and that issuers may continue to relyupon the CEA, other rules, and interpretations. However, a number of no-actionpositions granted during the pendency of this rulemaking specified thatthey were subject to such action as the Commission might take in the courseof the rulemaking. Although promulgation of these final rules is not intendedto affect the validity of existing issues offered pursuant to previousno-action positions, such prior no-action positions are superseded as toall other offerings.  Finally, several commenters stated that before the Commission grants otherexemptive relief under andSection;34.2(b), it should provide a 90-day periodfor public comment as required by Section 4c(b) of the CEA. The Commissionbelieves, however, that the notice and public comment requirements of Section4c(b) of the CEA have been satisfied by the comment opportunities providednot only on the rule proposal but also with respect to the Advance Notice.The public has thus been given ample notice and opportunity to commenton the case-by-case exemptive rule.C. Section 34.3 NoticeProposed andSection; 34.3 would have required that where the price used fordetermining the settlement of the commodity-dependent payments of an optionhybrid is based on prices reported on a designated contract market, theissuer must provide the Commission with written notification within fivebusiness days of the effective date of the offering. One commenter notedthat the phrase ``the effective date of the offering'' is ambiguous andrequested clarification. The Commission construes the phrase ``effectivedate of the offering'' to mean the date on which the instrument is issued.D. Additional Issues1. <T3>Granted options.</T3> In connection with the proposed rules, the Commissionrequested comment as to the appropriateness of extending the proposed exemptionto granted options and the conditions pursuant to which such options shouldbe permitted.\2\\6\<NOTE/> Several commenters urged the Commission to permit grantedoption hybrid instruments (such as instruments containing an option grantedto the issuer) and suggested possible revisions to the proposed rules toimplement this suggestion. The Commission believes that the issues raisedby granted option hybrid instruments require further consideration. Therefore,to the extent that issuers seek to issue granted options, they may do sosubject to the conditions of the trade option exemption of Commission Rule32.4(a) or pursuant to case-by-case relief.\2\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ 54 FR at 1135 n.32.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ Commission Rule 32.4(a), 17 CFR 32.4(a)(1988) provides:``Except for the provisions of andSection;andSection; 32.2, 32.8 and 32.9,which shall in any event apply to all commodity option transactions, theprovisions of this Part shall not apply to a commodity option offered bya person which has a reasonable basis to believe that the option is offeredto a producer, processor, or commercial user of, or a merchant handling,the commodity which is the subject of the commodity option transaction,or the products or by-products thereof, and that such producer, processor,commercial user or merchant is offered or enters into the commodity optiontransaction solely for purposes related to its business as such.'' <T3>See also</T3> note 7 referring to capped option indexing, <T3>supra,</T3> and related text.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.

Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA''), Pub. L. 96-534, 94 Stat. 1164,5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>, requires each Federal agency to consider, in the courseof proposing substantive rules, the effect of those rules on small entities.A small entity is defined to include, <T3>inter alia</T3>, a ``small business'' and a ``small organization.''5 U.S.C. 601(6).\2\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ ``Small organizations,'' as used in the RFA, meansa ``not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operatedand is not dominant in its field.'' 5 U.S.C. 601(4).

(<T3>Id.</T3>)The Commission notes that the notification procedure for the regulatoryexemption (andSection; 34.3), would apply generally to any issuer of hybridinstruments with commodity option-dependent payments that are referencedto a futures price on a designated contract market and does not specificallyimplicate any Commission registrant, large trader or contract market inits status as such.Based upon the Commission's experience with issuers who have sought no-actionrelief and filed notices pursuant to published Commission advisories concerninghybrid instruments, the Commission anticipates that most issuers wouldnot constitute ``small businesses.'' \2\\9\<NOTE/> The Commission notes that the exemptive rules adopted hereinwill not require burdensome legal, accounting, consulting or expert costs.The determination of whether an offering would qualify for the proposedexemption requires minimal analysis of data that will be readily availableto the issuer. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ All such petitioners for relief were either major corporations,government-chartered corporations or large banks and all had assets approachingor in excess of $100 million.
