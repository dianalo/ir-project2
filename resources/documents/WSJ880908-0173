But behind the scenes, Soviet aviation officials are laying the groundwork for expanding the sale of civilian aircraft beyond Moscow's current markets.    Each afternoon one or two of the sleek, powerful MiG-29s soar and dive in heartstopping performances for thousands of spectators, winning rave reviews from technical journalists and even grudging admiration from Western fighter builders. This is only the second time Moscow's latest MiG has been shown in the West.    &quot;Of course the MiGs demonstrate our technical prowess,&quot; says Vadim G. Karpinsky, chief of engineering for the export arm of the Soviet Ministry of Aviation Industry, Aviaexport. And he suggests that this technical prowess extends to Soviet-built civilian models. &quot;In a few years, we'll have new types of planes with good fuel efficiency,&quot; Mr. Karpinsky says in an interview. &quot;I feel we can sell our {civilian} aircraft in Western countries.&quot;    He specifically mentions the Tupolev Tu-204 and the Ilyushin Il-96, both of which will make their first flights this year and then go into testing for certification. The Tu-204 is a medium-range, 214-seat, twin-engine airplane with &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; cockpit technology common in fighters but until now found in civilian aircraft only in the Airbus Industrie A-320. This technology uses computers instead of mechanical devices to drive the aircraft's electrical controls. The Il-96, a four-engined, wide-bodied, 300-seat jetliner for long-range operations, has the same cockpit technology and engines. It was supposed to make its debut at Farnborough, a one-week show that ends Sunday, but wasn't ready.    Mr. Karpinsky predicts the Tu-204 and the Il-96 will prove attractive not only to the Soviet Union's traditional buyers, the East bloc and developing nations, but also in the West.    No negotiations are under way, but Mr. Karpinsky says a European charter airline association has expressed interest. India, which now buys most of its planes from the U.S. and Western Europe, is another potential customer, he says.    The Soviet Union sells and leases planes in some 100 countries. But its most traditional market, after state carrier Aeroflot, is seeing some erosion. Interflug, the East German airline, recently purchased three Airbus A-310 aircraft and the sale of Boeing Co. jetliners to Polish and Romanian carriers has been cleared by the Coordinating Committee for Export Control, or Cocom, a committee of the U.S. and its allies that must approve high-technology exports to communist countries.    Interflug's decision &quot;isn't a disappointment,&quot; Mr. Karpinsky says. &quot;They need such aircraft.&quot; But he says that when East bloc airlines compare the price, operating cost and expense of training, spare parts and maintenance of the Tu-204 and Il-96 with Western models, they will stick with their customary Soviet supplier.    Soviet allies also can pay for Russian planes in goods or their own currencies, while purchases in the West require hardcurrency financing.    Aviaexport doesn't have sales representatives in the West yet. In May the group moved from the Foreign Trade Ministry to the Aviation Industry Ministry, and staffing is being increased as sales efforts gear up. </TEXT></DOC>
