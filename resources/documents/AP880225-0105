But we have nothing to show for our non-violentapproaches. If violence erupts, what will be surprising is that ithas taken so long,'' said Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prizefor his fight against apartheid.   Tutu met with the Rev. Frank Chikane, general-secretary of theSouth African Council of Churches, to discuss a response to theorders banning political activities by the opposition organizations.   ``I would not be surprised if they (the government) act againstthe church,'' Chikane told reporters.   The meeting took place at Khotso House, the Johannesburgheadquarters for many of the restricted organizations. Black paperwas draped at Khotso House as a sign of mourning.   Both clergymen appealed to the black majority not to lose hope,to white voters to disassociate themselves from the government, andto the international community to isolate South Africa.   Newspapers, business leaders and politicans criticized thegovernment, saying the suppression of the major black politicalgroups would provoke violence.   In Lusaka, Zambia, the outlawed African National Congress calledfor ``resistance and defiance.'' The ANC is the main guerrillaorganization fighting to end white-minority domination in SouthAfrica.   ``The organizations and civic bodies that have thus been bannedwere committed to non-violent forms of struggle,'' the ANC said ina statement.   ``It is not advocacy of or engagement in armed struggle that theregime fears, but the very expression of democratic opposition.''   President P.W. Botha on Wednesday gave Law and Order MinisterAdriaan Vlok the power to prohibit all activity by anyorganization. Vlok immediately banned 17 organizations, includingthe largest anti-apartheid coalition, the United Democratic Front,from engaging in political activities.   He also prohibited the nation's largest labor federation, the750,000-member Congress of South African Trade Unions, fromengaging in any political activity, including commemorating days ofimportance to blacks.   In addition, restrictions were imposed on the activities ofindividual black leaders.   ``I regret the further erosion of the rule of law. ... Banningand detentions can never be the solution,'' said the Rev. AllanHendrickse, leader of the mixed-race house of Parliament. Whitesand people of mixed race are represented in Parliament, but not the26 million black majority.   Colin Eglin, leader of the anti-apartheid Progressive FederalParty, said, ``The government was busy turning South Africa into athird-grade banana republic where real power is not with theParliament, the courts or the people but in the hands of arestricted political clique.''   Gavin Relly, chairman of Anglo-American Corp., the nation'sbiggest conglomerate, said, ``The curtailment of civil andpolitical freedoms to the interests of public order should besubject to judicial control. Yesterday's actions are steps awayfrom the rule of law.''   The New Nation, a newspaper for blacks published by the SouthAfrican Catholic Bishops Conference, was among several observerspredicting increased violence because of the regulations, whichVlok said were meant to improve the atmosphere of peace andsecurity.   ``Trade unionists have warned that by banning the commemorationof days of mourning, the government has set the stage for massiveconfrontation,'' The New Nation said. ``The ban is unlikely to stopworkers from observing these days.''   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said the governmentactions were inevitable but added: ``Suppression of radical orrevolutionary movements does not solve the country's problems. Itonly provides the space within which solutions can be found.''   The orders ``violate a number of basic freedoms, moreparticularly the freedoms of association and expression,'' saidRobert Charlton, vice chancellor of the University of theWitwatersrand. He said the clampdown would provoke protest anddisruption on campuses.   The large black political organization Inkatha was not amongthose restricted. But the leadership in the KwaZulu LegislativeAssembly, headed by Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, condemnedthe restriction of black organizations, including those with whichInkatha has been feuding.   ``There would be no need for the state of emergency if blackdemocracy was unshackled and if blacks were free to support theleaders and the parties of their choice,'' the KwaZulu caucus said.</TEXT></DOC>
