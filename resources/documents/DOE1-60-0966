A growing number of vehicles are being converted, in spite of thelow energy density of its major constituent, methane. To overcome thisdrawback and to achieve an acceptable driving range, on-board storageat pressures higher than 14 mega pascals is required. The storage capacitycould be substantially improved at much lower pressures by using activatedcarbon as an adsorbent. However, the success of the adsorption techniqueof methane storage depends on the rate at which the heat of methane adsoptioncan be dissipated. Due to a low value of heat transfer in the methane-carbonsystem a major problem arises when the reservoir must be filled rapidly.In order to optimize the conditions of the adsorbed methane storage,both equilibrium and kinetic aspects of the process must be known. Inthis paper the equilibium data for the methane storage capacity of anadsorbent-filled reservoir are presented as a function of pressure, temperatureand activated carbon poperties. Theoretical evaluation has confirmedthat the rate of methane mass transfer controlled by diffusion is a relativelyfast process. Consequently the rate of heat generation by adsoption isfast and the amount of heat generated depends on the equilibrium. Thus,in the overall process of methane storage in an adsorbent filled reservoir,the limiting factor is the heat transfer. 4 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
