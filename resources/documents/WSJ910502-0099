In return, the story went, the Israeligovernment delivered arms to the Iranians at the behest ofthe new Reagan administration.   Much of the power of Mr. Sick's piece, to which the NewYork Times devoted two-thirds of its op-ed page, derived fromthe fact that the author had only recently, and reluctantly,been forced to give credence to these stories.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Sick's precise words bear quoting: &quot;I first heardthese rumors in 1981 and I dismissed them as fanciful. Iagain heard them during the 1988 election campaign, and Iagain refused to believe them. I had worked in and around theMiddle East long enough to be skeptical of the conspiracytheories that abound in the region.&quot; It was only aftercompiling a massive computerized data base that he began tonotice the &quot;curious pattern&quot; of events that led him to gopublic with his concerns.   But Mr. Sick seems to have forgotten his own thinking.Here is a statement he made, quoted by the Rocky MountainNews on Oct. 30, 1988 -- at the very peak of the 1988presidential campaign -- in which he discussed thepossibility of a hostage deal:   &quot;At first I dismissed this, but not any more. I'mconvinced on the basis of what I heard that there were somemeetings in Paris. I know that the Iranians changed theirpolicy at that time. . . .&quot;   Just over a month before that, on Aug. 26, 1988, Mr. Sicktold the New York Daily News in a telephone interview: &quot;Thereis something here. I just don't know how much. . . . I havealways been puzzled at why the Reagan administration gave acomplete green light to Israel (to deliver arms to Iran)immediately after they took office. These people despised theayatollah, but they let Israel go ahead with deliveries. Iwould certainly have to take account of this stuff if I waswriting my book over again.&quot;   Mr. Sick, the principal Carter aide for Iran during thehostage crisis, author of &quot;All Fall Down,&quot; a highly regardedbook on the hostage crisis, and now an adjunct professor atColumbia, seems to have made a major error on the subjectabout which he is the world expert: his own mind. It could bea simple mistake; but it could also have to do with therecognition that the convert has more impact than he who isto the faith born. Simply put, had Mr. Sick acknowledged ayears-long belief in Republican plotting, his account wouldhave had far less impact.   All of this makes a difference because it is Gary Sick'sstature that moved speculations about a Reagan campaignconspiracy from the fringe to the mainstream. Indeed, thesubcommittee chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs Committeeare scheduled to meet with Mr. Sick today, beginning aprocess that might lead to a full-scale investigation, byCongress or by a special prosecutor, or by both.   But the flaws in Mr. Sick's account of his own thoughtsraise serious doubts about his credibility. Given the vastarray of issues facing Congress, the representatives would dowell to let this one drift back to the fringe where itbelongs.   ---   Mr. Pipes, director of the Foreign Policy ResearchInstitute in Philadelphia, is studying conspiracy theories inthe Middle East. His latest book is &quot;Greater Syria,&quot; out lastyear from Oxford.</TEXT></DOC>
