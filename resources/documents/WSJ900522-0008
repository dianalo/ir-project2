Greenberger   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/22/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><CO>   LATAM</CO><IN>MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)</IN><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)STATE DEPARTMENT (STD)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan congressional group chargesthat 14 of El Salvador's 15 top military officers, includingthe defense minister and the chief of staff, have commandedmilitary units during their careers that committed serioushuman-rights abuses.   In a new report, the congressional Arms Control andForeign Policy Caucus traces how the officers' careersadvanced despite their troops' corruption and crimes againstcivilians. The report comes as the House is set to vote todayon a proposal to withhold 50% of U.S. military aid from ElSalvador. The vote could signal the beginning of a breakdownin bipartisan support for El Salvador, congressional aidessay. Congress has approved virtually every White Houserequest for such funds since 1984.</LP><TEXT>   Although the U.S. has provided El Salvador $1 billion inmilitary aid over the past decade and called regularly forreform, the 39-page report raises serious questions &quot;as towhether the officer corps has either been above the law inallowing repeated abuses of human rights to occur on theirwatch, or, at a minimum, has shown serious problems ofcompetence in failing to halt them.&quot;   The report states that no military officers have beenbrought to trial in nearly 50 cases of human-rights abusesreported by monitoring groups, suggesting that &quot;at a basiclevel, there is little accountability.&quot; The murder lastNovember of six Jesuit priests, reportedly at the hands ofmilitary personnel, has focused Congress's attention again onhuman-rights abuses by El Salvador's military.   One reason for a lack of accountability, the report says,is that most Salvadoran officers' primary loyalty is tomembers of their class at the nation's military academy,rather than to the armed forces as a whole or to civilianauthorities. The report asserts that this is particularlytrue for the class of 1966, whose members currently are insenior positions. The report says members of this class havesuccessfully resisted efforts by the U.S. embassy to forcethe retirement of corrupt officers or those believedresponsible for human-rights abuses.   The leader of that class, Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, is nowmilitary chief of staff. He formerly was deputy director ofthe Treasury Police, which killed 30 civilians during a sweepof the Soyapango district of San Salvador on April 7, 1981,according to the State Department. Similar abuses occurredwhen Gen. Rafael Humberto Larios, currently the defenseminister, commanded the Artillery Brigade in 1986 and 1987,the report says.   Along with the concern about human-rights abuses inSalvador's military, a general decline in U.S. interest inCentral America is undermining congressional support forSalvadoran aid. The end of the Cold War and the electoraldefeat of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas by VioletaChamorro, a staunch U.S. ally, have greatly reduced U.S.concerns about the spread of communism in this hemisphere.The Bush administration now is preoccupied with the sweepingchanges under way in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.   &quot;This is probably the end of the blank check for militaryaid to El Salvador,&quot; says Robert Kurz, a Central Americaexpert at the Brookings Institution.   Under the aid plan that the House is expected to considertoday, the 50% cut in military assistance would be restoredif leftist guerrillas battling Salvador's government launch anew offensive or refuse to negotiate. Alternatively, militaryaid would be completely eliminated if the government doesn'tconduct a thorough investigation of the murder of the Jesuitsor refuses to negotiate with guerrillas, or if there is amilitary coup.</TEXT></DOC>
