California's legislation, signed into law Wednesday by Gov.George Deukmejian, bans the sale of 55 semiautomatic assaultrifles, pistols and shotguns beginning Jan. 1. But they allowpeople who currently own those weapons lawfully to keep them ifthey register with the state.   ``There's no question it's a defeat for gun owners and for us,''Richard Gardiner of the National Rifle Association's Washington,D.C. office, said of the signing. ``But I think the backlash willbe greater than the spread (of similar bills). While it's atactical loss, strategically it's going to be a big help.''   The legislation was prompted by a Jan. 17 attack at a Stocktonelementary school in which a deranged man with an AK-47 assaultrifle killed five children and wounded 30 other people beforetaking his own life.   Deukmejian said he wasn't surprised or worried about gun owners'ensuing threats to recall him for signing the measures, adding thathe also would sign pending legislation requiring a 15-day waitingperiod for all gun sales. There is already a waiting period forpistols.   In Louisiana, gun control proponents said a similar bill'sfailure to gain approval Wednesday was the result of rurallegislators who did not appreciate the problems of violent crime inNew Orleans and other metropolitan areas.   The Louisiana House's Committee on Criminal Justice deferredaction on the bill, which would have required registration ofsemiautomatic assault rifles.   Lawmakers said it was unlikely the ``Sportsman's Paradise''would adopt any gun legislation this year.   Sarah Brady, whose husband, James, was wounded in the 1981assassination attempt on then-President Reagan, praisedDeukmejian's action.   ``We're very pleased with the bill,'' Mrs. Brady, head ofHandgun Control Inc., said during an appearance in Philadelphia.``It's significant because people statewide came together andrealized this issue is becoming less and less political and morenecessary.''   She said believes President Bush eventually will sign apermanent federal ban on the domestic manufacturing and sale ofassault weapons.   Bush recently banned importation of such weapons.   Gardiner scoffed at claims that the California legislation wouldspread across the states, noting that gun-control advocates madesimilar statements in 1981, after the town of Morton Grove, Ill.,passed a handgun ban in the wake of the shootings of singer JohnLennon, Reagan and Pope John Paul VI.   ``They've said it every time they passed a bill, and it's neverhappened,'' Gardiner said. ``After Morton Grove, three littleneighboring cities passed bans. But what was important was that awhole passel of states passed legislation prohibiting cities fromtaking such action.''</TEXT></DOC>
