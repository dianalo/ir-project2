Changes in the fiber weight, density and tensile strengthretention are used to explain the reaction behavior. One goal of thestudy was to determine the potential of a silica layer as an effectiveinterfacial diffusion barrier, which would provide good retention ofmechanical properties to Nicalon ceramic fibers after thermal exposure.23 references.</TEXT></DOC>
