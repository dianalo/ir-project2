The round three instruments were individualized for eachpanel member. The productivity items were rated by the panel members,and descriptive statistics were used to describe the combined order oflistings and weights for determining the relative importance of eachfactor in the consensus model. The nonparametric statistics were usedto examine the degree of consensus between the mean values on the firstinstrument with the ranked values for the second instrument.
