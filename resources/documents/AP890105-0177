(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's first full-scale,government-sponsored hypodermic needle exchange program to combatthe spread of AIDS has been approved by the Tacoma-Pierce CountyBoard of Health.   The panel voted 4-1 Wednesday to spend $43,165 this year on theprogram begun in August by David Purchase, a former drug counselorwho began with a card table and a box of donated syringes.   Purchase estimated Wednesday that he has distributed more than11,000 clean needles in an attempt to reduce the spread of AIDSamong addicts who commonly share syringes while injecting themselveswith drugs. Police and other officials estimate the city has about3,000 intravenous drug users.   ``That's history, that really is history,'' Purchase said afterthe vote.   ``We have the most successful program in the U.S. _ the first andthe most successful,'' said Pierce County Executive Joe Stortini, amember of the board.   ``I'm not convinced that the needle exchange, by itself, has donea thing to stop the spread of AIDS,'' said Greg Mykland, a citycouncilman who is a member of the health board and cast the lonedissenting vote.   ``I've never heard of anything I could have supported less a yearor two ago,'' said County Council member Barbara Skinner, anotherboard member, ``but I've heard that it costs $100,000 to treatsomeone with AIDS and a needle costs 35 cents. That sounds like apretty good deal to me.''   The money was designated for paying Purchase to spend fiveafternoons a week running two mobile clinics that provide needles,AIDS information and drug treatment coupons.   A smaller needle exchange project, modeled partly on Purchase'sexample, was started recently by health officials in New York buthas enrolled only 34 of the city's 250,000 addicts and and isdesigned primarily as a research effort.   A private, non-profit organization in Portland, Ore., announcedThursday that it had hired a nurse to begin a needle distributionprogram there. The program was first announced last June, but wasstalled for months when the clinic was unable to find an insurancecompany to cover the program.   In Boston, Mayor Raymond Flynn backed a needle exchange program,but it was rejected by the City Council.   An organization headquartered in Boston called the AIDS Brigade,which includes Yale graduate students as well as former addicts andconvicts, distributes AIDS education materials, bleach and needlesin New Haven, Conn., New York City, New Jersey and Boston.   ``Tacoma is really leading the way nationally on this,'' said DonDes Jarlais, director of the New York state Division of SubstanceAbuse Services.   One-fifth of the nation's 80,000 reported cases of acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome have been in intravenous drug users, andthe fatal disease is spreading in that population faster than anyother, health officials say.   Studies of European needle exchange programs show no increase indrug use and a sharp decrease in needle-sharing habits, said TerryReid, manager of the the health department's drug abuse and AIDSprograms.</TEXT></DOC>
