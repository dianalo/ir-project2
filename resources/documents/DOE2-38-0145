In order to removethe above defects, this invention proposes an amorphous solar cell consistingof at least one unit cell which has at least a substrate and the firstelectrode layer formed thereon, the first cell element consisting ofthe first p, i and n type semiconductor layers thereon, a transparentintermediate electrode layer which is further formed on the above, inaddition the second cell element consisting of each of the second n,i and p type semiconductor layers formed successively thereon and thesecond electrode layer formed on the foregoing and furthermore the firstelectrode section connecting the above first and second electrode layers,and the second electrode section connected to the above intermediateelectrode layer; and which has the composition of connecting at leasttwo of the above first and second cell elements in parallel.
