Local leaders aregrowing increasingly concerned.   Immigration visa applications are up sharply and businessesreport a rise in the number of professionals resigning to emigratebefore 1997, when this British colony reverts to Chinesesovereignty and rule from Beijing.   ``No one knows quite how extensive the problem is, but it'scertainly a problem,'' said Jimmy D. McGregor, director of the HongKong General Chamber of Commerce. ``As 1997 approaches, thisproblem becomes more acute.''   To a large degree, he added, ``it's the perception of Chinawhich is causing people to make that decision to go.''   Hong Kong, a capitalistic speck on China's southeastern coast,enjoys one of Asia's highest standards of living.   The Communist government in Beijing has promised the territorycan retain its capitalist system for 50 years after 1997 and enjoya ``high degree of autonomy.''   But a high percentage of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people arerefugees from China and many are skeptical about Beijing's promises.   A recent poll by Survey Research Hong Kong, an independentmarket research company, indicated one-fifth of Hong Kong's 1.5million families have at least one member with foreign residencyrights or with the intent to obtain such rights from othercountries.   Many of the people planning to leave are skilled professionalsand business executives; companies are noticing increasedemigration among top-level employees.   ``The problem area is in the executive level,'' said MichaelBroadbent, spokesman for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, thecolony's premier bank. About 8 percent of the bank's 670 locallyhired executives resigned to emigrate last year, compared with 3percent the year before, he said.   ``Yes, we are concerned about it. No, we are not unduly alarmed.Nobody likes to lose qualified people who you've invested a lot oftime and money in training.''   The California-based Bank of America also has noticed asignificant rise in emigration among top-level employees in HongKong, even though it is boosting wages and increasing trainingcosts, said Senior Vice President Stephen B. Hunt. ``The issue ofturnover is becoming a significant issue in our business.''   Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a political analyst at Chinese University ofHong Kong, says that when his friends in their 30s and 40s ``lookaround at their friends they can hardly find any people who aredetermined to stay.''   ``They discover that every friend has already secured apassport, is about to do so, or is in the process of doing so,''said Cheng.   The colonial government does not keep emigration statistics.Although Hong Kong people have a history of resettling overseas,several indicators show the exodus is increasing.   Last year, 53,471 people, or nearly 1 percent of the population,applied for a police document certifying the holder has no criminalrecord, an increase of 50 percent from 1986. The document isrequired by many countries to obtain visas.   Statistics from the Australian, Canadian and U.S. consulatesindicate 1987 visa applications were well above previous yearlevels, in many cases because of expanded immigration programs forpeople with money or professional skills.   The exodus is causing enough concern that local organizationsare offering a seminar in April on ``how to turn the emigrationexodus to your advantage'' and how to ``create the incentive tostay.''   Top government officials have expressed concern about theemigration rates but argue that many people will return to HongKong once they have obtained a foreign passport.   They claim many people seek foreign passports primarily asinsurance for after the Chinese take over and estimate as many as8,000 people returned to Hong Kong in 1986 after obtainingresidency rights in other countries.   But among the well-educated Hong Kong Chinese holding foreignpassports are those who plan to remain in the colony just longenough to make money before the Chinese take over.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs March 9</NOTE></DOC>
