VizzolaTicino (Varese), Italy, filed an application to the FAA Brussel's Officefor U.S. type certification for its Model C22J airplane. They made a newapplication for U.S. type certificate on October 29, 1986. The CaproniModel C22J airplane is a small, two-place, twin-engine jet airplane witha maximum takeoff weight (with tip tanks) of 2,767 pounds. Two MicroturboTRS-18 turbojet engines are installed side-by-side in the fuselage aftof the cockpit. The airplane is fully aerobatic and has a maximum operatingaltitude of 25,000 feet. <ITAG tagnum="84">Type Certification Basis </ITAG>The type certification basis for the Caproni Model C22J airplane is asfollows: Part 21 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), andSection; 21.29;part 23 of the FAR, effective February 1, 1965, including amendments 23-1through 23-33; part 36 of the FAR, effective December 1, 1969, as amendedby amendments 36-1 through the amendment effective on the date of typecertification; SFAR 27 effective February 1, 1974, as amended by amendments27-2 through 27-5; exemptions, if any; and special conditions adopted bythis rulemaking action. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>Special conditions may be issued and amended, as necessary, as part ofthe type certification basis if the Administrator finds that the airworthinessstandards designated in accordance with andSection; 21.17(a)(1) do not containadequate or appropriate safety standards because of novel or unusual designfeatures of an airplane. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issuedin accordance with andSection; 11.49, after public notice as required byandSection;andSection; 11.28 and 11.29(b), effective October 14, 1980, andwill become part of the type certification basis, as provided by andSection;21.17(a)(2). The proposed type design of the Caproni Model C22J airplane contains anumber of novel or unusual design features not envisaged by the applicablepart 23 airworthiness standards. Special conditions are considered necessarybecause the airworthiness standards of part 23 do not contain adequateor appropriate safety standards for the novel or unusual design featuresof the Model C22J airplane. <ITAG tagnum="84">Landing Gear </ITAG>The Model C22J airplane landing gear structure is made of composite material.This material and its assembly is completely different from the typicalmaterial in landing gear structures that have been predominant since theearly 1940's. Composite materials of the type used on the Model C22J airplaneare generally not susceptible to initiation of fatigue cracks by the applicationof repetitive loads, but are susceptible to damage in the form of cracks,breaks, and delaminations from intrinsic and discrete sources growing underapplication of repetitive loads. Because of this and other factors, theFAA has determined that the fatigue requirements of part 23 are inadequateto assure that composite material structure can withstand the repeatedloads of variable magnitude expected in service. The use of composite materials and extensive bonding of these materialsin the landing gear structure is a novel and unusual design feature withrespect to the type of airplane construction envisaged by the existingairworthiness standards of part 23. Because the requirements of part 23do not require the level of substantiation necessary for composite materialstructure, a special condition is being issued to include the necessaryairworthiness standards as a part of the type certification basis for theModel C22J airplane. This special condition is being issued to ensure thata level of safety exists for airplanes made from bonded composite materialsequivalent to those existing part 23 airplanes. This special condition will require composite structural components criticalto safe flight be evaluated by damage tolerance criteria. When damage toleranceis shown to be impractical, this special condition is worded to permitapproval, based on safe-life testing. The damage tolerance considerationapplies to the landing gear structure, since failure of this structurecould have catastrophic results. Metal detail designs may continue to beevaluated to the fatigue requirements of andSection; 23.572. Damage tolerance criteria for composite structure, in combination withthe existing material requirements of part 23, such as andSection;andSection;23.603 and 23.613, will provide a level of safety for the composite materiallanding gear structure used in the Model C22J airplane equivalent to thatrequired by the airworthiness standards of part 23. The lack of adequate service experience with composite material structuresin airplanes type certificated to the airworthiness standards of part 23,the unusual mechanical properties characteristics, and the experience withcomposite material structural bonding, to date, necessitate issuing specialconditions to assure an appropriate level of safety for the Model C22Jlanding gear structure. This special condition is intended to require:(1) Accounting for environmental effects, i.e., temperature and humidityon material mechanical properties in all structural substantiation analysesand tests; (2) limit load residual strength with impact damage from discretesources; (3) ability to carry ultimate load with realistic intrinsic anddiscrete impact damage at the threshold of detectability; and (4) designfeatures to prevent disbonds greater than the disbonds for which limitload capability has been shown. Proof testing of each production componentto limit load and reliance on manufacturing quality control proceduresbetween limit and ultimate load may be used in lieu of design featuresprovided each bonded joint is subjected to its critical design limit loadduring the proof testing. Acceptable non-destructive testing techniquesdo not yet exist in state-of-the-art composite technology to reliably identifyweak bonds. However, proof testing of each production article may be discontinuedif such tests are developed and accepted by the FAA. Because the composite material and bonding may require preventive maintenanceand inspection procedures different from those commonly utilized for existinglanding gear structure, this special condition requires that instructionsfor continued airworthiness be established in addition to those requiredby andSection; 23.1529. <ITAG tagnum="84">Lightning Protection </ITAG>The regulations incorporated by reference include standards for protectionfrom damage to the structure of the airplane by lightning (andSection; 23.867)and from ignition of fuel vapor (andSection; 23.954). These standards donot provide the level of safety for the electronic system that is inherentlyprovided by traditional designs which utilize mechanical means to connectthe engine to the flight deck. The forward fuselage of the Model C22J airplane,though not a primary structure, is made of composite material. Electronicsystems need additional protection when installed in composite airframestructure, which provides less shielding. For airplanes employing the useof composite materials, the lightning produced voltages and currents couldincrease substantially and additional protecting design features shouldbe installed.The Model C22J airplane with the Microturbo TRS-18 turbojet engines isbeing designed with the propulsion systems using only electrical interfacesfor critical functions such as crew inputs to engines. These systems canbe susceptible to disruption to both the command/response signals and theoperational mode as a result of direct lightning strike attachment or electricaland magnetic interference. To ensure that a level of safety is achievedequivalent to that of existing aircraft, a special condition is being issuedwhich requires that these components be designed and installed to precludecomponent damage and interruption of function due to both direct and indirecteffects of lightning. <ITAG tagnum="84">Protection From Unwanted Effect of High Energy Radio Frequency (HERF)</ITAG>Airplane designs which utilize metal skins and mechanical command and controlmeans have traditionally been less susceptible to the effects of RF energyfrom ground-based transmitters. There is a trend toward increased use ofcomposite structures that do not provide the HERF shielding normally providedby metal skins and electrical and electronic command systems to performcritical airplane functions such as engine control. Therefore, the effectivemeasures against the effects of high energy radio frequency fields mustbe provided for by the design and installation of these systems. The primaryfactors that have contributed to this increased concern are: (1) The increasinguse of sensitive electronics that perform critical and essential functions;(2) the reduced electromagnetic shielding afforded airplane systems byadvanced technology airframe materials; (3) the adverse service experienceof military airplanes which use these technologies; and (4) the numberand power of radio frequency emitters increases and expected future increases.In showing compliance with the regulations for protection against hazardscaused by the exposure to high energy radio frequency fields, electricaland electronics systems which perform critical and essential functionsmust be considered. The hazards addressed include those which would resultin a catastrophic failure condition to the airplane. Failures that wouldbe a hazard to the airplane, but not catastrophic, are considered underandSection; 23.1309. To prevent this occurrence, airplane systems which performcritical functions must be designed and installed to ensure that the operationand operational capabilities of these critical functions are not adverselyaffected when the airplane is exposed to high energy radio fields. Airplanesystems which perform essential functions must be protected to ensure thatessential functions can be recovered after the airplane has been exposedto the high energy radio frequency fields. Manual mode reversion is consideredan acceptable method of retaining the essential functions. Reliance onredundancy as a means of protection against the effects of external RFfields is generally insufficient since all elements of a redundant systemare likely to be exposed to the fields concurrently. No universally accepted guidance to define the maximum energy level inwhich civilian airplane system installations must be capable of operatingsafely has been established. At this time, the FAA and other airworthinessauthorities are working to establish an agreed level of RF energy levelrepresentative of that to which the airplane will be exposed in service.This special condition requires that the airplane be evaluated under aninterim standard for the protection of the electronic system and its associatedwiring harness. <ITAG tagnum="84">Electronic Engine Control System </ITAG>The applicable airworthiness requirements for the engine installation donot contain adequate standards by which to determine an acceptable levelof safety for an electronic engine control system installed on a part 23airplane. Therefore, special conditions are required to establish thatthe overall electronic engine control system exhibits an acceptable levelof system integrity and reliability equivalent to a hydromechanical systemmeeting current airworthiness standards. <ITAG tagnum="84">Pressurized Fuel Tanks </ITAG>The applicable airworthiness requirements for the pressurized fuel tanksinstallations do not contain adequate standards by which to determine anacceptable level of safety on a part 23 airplane. Therefore, special conditionsare required which are based on andSection; 25.965(d) pressurized fuel tanksrequirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>Notice of Proposed Special Conditions, Notice No. SC-23-ACE-45, Docket064CE, was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 10, 1989 (54 FR 10160) and the commentperiod closed July 10, 1989.
