The root causes of these rising pricesare the decreasing availability of existing landfill space and the difficultyinvolved with developing new landfills. One of the most popular waysof controlling waste disposal costs is the modular starved air heat recoveryincinerator. On-site heat recovery incineration (HRI) plants are viablefor small (under 60,000 population) municipalities, industrial sites,and institutional facilities who generate non-hazardous municipal solidwastes (MSW) in quantities of between 10 and 200 tons/day, and who canuse the by-product steam or hot water in their daily operations. Foreach ton of waste that is burned, between 4 to 6 MBTU of usable heatenergy is produced.</TEXT></DOC>
