Havel said he was detained Wednesday on his way to a lunch withthe West German ambassador at the nation's embassy in Prague. Itwas the second day in a row that police picked him up; theydetained Havel for about three hours on Tuesday.   ``The police told me that if I'm in Prague they don't like me tomove around and speak with people because I may face the sametroubles again, '' Havel said today in a telephone interview fromPrague.   He said he arrived in Czechoslovakia's capital early this weekfrom his summer cottage in eastern Bohemia.   ``They said they are not interested if I have lunch with anambassador when I'm in Prague but they don't like me to meet with(my countrymen),'' Havel said.   Havel, Czechoslovakia's most prominent human rights campaigner,was jailed for eight months earlier this year but released onparole midway through the sentence after unprecedented protests athome and abroad.   Officials say Havel and some other writers have remained underprohibition because of their refusal to renounce politicalactivities.   Czechoslovak human rights activists are campaigning increasinglyfor an official revision of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion thatcrushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms.   The Aug. 21 anniversary of the invasion is expected to result inrenewed anti-government protests.   Politburo member and Prague party boss Miroslav Stepan saidTuesday that authorities would not tolerate disruptions in August.   Czechoslovak authorities have harshly condemned a currentpetition, known as Several Sentences, that demands more democraticreforms.   More than 11,500 people, including Havel, have signed thepetition, say human rights activists in Prague.</TEXT></DOC>
