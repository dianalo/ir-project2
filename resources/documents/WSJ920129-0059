The council, the research arm of the National Academy ofSciences, submitted the report to the Bush administration inthe hope that it would encourage statistics-collectingagencies to provide policy makers with what the councilconsiders a more balanced and relevant set of trade data.</LP><TEXT>   The study estimated that the U.S. underreports its exportsof goods by $10 billion to $20 billion annually, in partbecause some exporters tend to undervalue their shipments toavoid high shipping costs or import duties. In addition,exporters sometimes fail to report shipments to customsauthorities. &quot;When merchandise arrives in Los Angeles or NewYork from overseas, officials review the paperwork to ensurethat tariffs are paid,&quot; said Robert Baldwin, chairman of theNRC panel that produced the study. &quot;Exports get lessscrutiny.&quot;   The panel urged the government to adopt a &quot;supplemental&quot;measurement of trade performance that tallies transactions bythe nationalities of the majority owners of firms, ratherthan by the countries in which such firms are located. Bythis broader measure, which includes the revenues ofU.S.-owned firms located overseas, the U.S. had only a $64billion trade deficit in 1987, compared with the official$148 billion figure that was based only on the differencebetween U.S. imports and exports.   The broader measurement also would count the domesticsales by U.S. firms to U.S. subsidiaries of foreigncompanies.   The current reporting system doesn't tally economiceffects of the jobs created by foreign investments in theU.S. or those of jobs lost by the transfer of U.S. productioncapacity overseas, the NRC report said.   &quot;Both from a competitiveness point of view and a jobspoint of view, the trade data don't tell business leaders andpolicy makers everything they need to know,&quot; contended Mr.Baldwin, an economics professor at the University ofWisconsin.   Academics and business executives sit on the panel, whichdidn't recommend specific economic or trade policies in itsreport. The thrust of its findings, however, clearly warnedagainst political overreaction to conventional tradereporting. In recent years, such figures have been &quot;wrong,misunderstood or misused,&quot; the report said. In certaininstances, they even have &quot;misinformed policy debates.&quot;   The panel also blamed the severity of the 1987stock-market collapse partly on an exaggerated concern aboutthe effects of the U.S. trade deficit.   The NRC project received funds from three of the federalgovernment's data-collecting agencies -- the U.S. CustomsService and the Commerce Department's Bureau of EconomicAnalysis and the Census Bureau.   The panel also urged the U.S. to cooperate with othercountries in establishing channels for collectingstandardized data on trade, production, employment andinvestments.</TEXT></DOC>
