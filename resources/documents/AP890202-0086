Hekmatyar said arrangements had been made to secure the fall ofmajor cities without large-scale attacks, but he gave no details.   Also today, a senior guerrilla military commander, Abdul Haq,said that while Afghanistan's communist government could not survivelong, there were indications the regime was making efforts to defenditself.   Haq, who commands guerrilla forces of the Yunis Khalis grouparound Kabul, said 5,000 special troops recently returned from theSoviet Union after receiving training in street fighting to defendcities against rebel attacks.   The government was also building up special units to formdefenses against the guerrillas after the withdrawal of Sovietforces, he said.   Haq said the Afghan army, formed largely of recruits forced intothe service, has shown signs of collapse and was of little use inmajor operations. The government forces are increasingly confined tolarge towns and cities while the guerrillas control the surroundingcountryside, he said.   Under a U.N. agreement, the Red Army is to be out of Afghanistanby Feb. 15. It intervened in the country in December 1979 to backthe government in its war with Moslem guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
