As early as April 1986, the officer said, he informed his superiors of his part in a special communications network established by former White House aide, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, to assist the air resupply operation. He said that three months later, he received a cable from headquarters raising only a &quot;soft&quot; warning about his role, and even as he became more active in the Contra-aid operation, he never received further instructions to end his involvement.    &quot;That is fine if you want to cover yourself,&quot; the officer said of the cable he received from CIA headquarters last July. &quot;But please gentlemen . . . that is not (an order to) 'cease and desist.'&quot;    House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair released a declassified transcript of the former station chief's testimony yesterday, which contradicts previous claims by higher-level CIA and State Department officers that they knew little about the Contra-supply operation.    The agency's deputy director for operations, Clair George, testified last October that the CIA had no direct or indirect role in &quot;facilitating&quot; arms shipments to the Contras. But yesterday, the former officer said that he provided information to help the resupply operation complete nine successful missions, in which tons of equipment were carried to insurgents in southern Nicaragua.    The CIA officer described the Contra commanders in Costa Rica as a gang who couldn't shoot straight -- when they shot at all. He told the panels that one prominent leader, Fernando &quot;Negro&quot; Chamorro, made only one armed foray into Nicaragua -- an attack on a border post 30 meters inside the country in 1983. When Sandinista forces counterattacked, the CIA officer said, Mr. Chamorro quickly retreated to Costa Rica, went to a pay telephone, called him at CIA headquarters in Virginia, and asked him to &quot;send mortars.&quot;    &quot;And did you do it?&quot; asked Senate lawyer Paul Barbadoro.    &quot;Of course not,&quot; the officer replied.    Another former top Contra leader, Eden Pastora, who was known as &quot;Commandante Zero&quot; during the Sandinista revolution, could have killed two U.S. senators when he dispatched a light plane to bomb a secret Cuban intelligence facility near Sandino International Airport in Managua, the officer told the committees. Instead the rebel pilot dive bombed a Nicaraguan airliner at the airport, and the blast sent his plane tumbling into the airport control tower as former Sen. Gary Hart (D., Colo.) and Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine) were flying to Managua.    In answer to a question from Sen. Cohen, now a member of the Senate investigating committee, the CIA officer said Mr. Pastora didn't submit his plans to the CIA for approval before ordering the bombing.    &quot;Would it surprise you if I told you that a CIA official informed both Sen. Hart and myself that (the mission) had been approved?&quot; Sen. Cohen asked.    &quot;It would be a surprise to me,&quot; the CIA agent replied.    Separately, an aide to Mr. Pastora claimed CIA officials in El Salvador approved the attack.    While describing the Contras' activities as &quot;shenanigans,&quot; the former CIA station chief became emotional when he told the committees that he fears that public disclosure of his name may be endangering his wife and children. The officer's alias, &quot;Tomas Castillo,&quot; was substituted for his real name in transcripts of his testimony released yesterday. Numerous news organizations, however, have referred to him by his real name in recent weeks. The officer has been recalled from San Jose, and along with a CIA officer from Honduras, has been placed on administrative leave from the agency.    The officer said that as early as the fall of 1985 he discussed a secret Contra-resupply airstrip in Costa Rica with Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams. He said Mr. Abrams indicated that the head of the CIA's Central America Task Force also knew about the project. Mr. Abrams is scheduled to testify today.    When he later became directly involved in the communications network set up by Col. North, the former station chief said he also informed the director of the agency's Latin American division about the operation. As the airdrops accelerated in September 1986, he said he regularly reported to headquarters.    The former official's testimony puts the CIA on the defensive. After first denying any involvement in the Contra resupply effort, CIA officials have fallen back on statements saying that nothing illegal was authorized and that the evidence has yet to show &quot;institutional malfeasance.&quot;    &quot;We had a policy and we stuck to it,&quot; said one official yesterday. But lawmakers of both parties were dubious about the meaning of the instructions given to the former station chief. &quot;That cable is a marvelous example of bureaucratic covering-your-rear-end,&quot; said one committee member.    As a field officer, the station chief had relatively little contact with CIA headquarters officials above the chief of the Latin American division. But he described two incidents when he was questioned by William Casey, the late former CIA director, and Col. North about a Costa Rica landowner, John Hull. Mr. Hull's property on the Nicaraguan border had been used by the rebels.    &quot;North asked me if John Hull was all right, indicating that the president was interested,&quot; the officer testified. &quot;On the next day, Director Casey asked me what was the name of the farmer who lived up in northern Costa Rica (who) was helping the resistance.&quot; Mr. Hull later figured in a gun-smuggling inquiry conducted by the U.S. attorney's office in Miami. He hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh is investigating whether Col. North and Justice Department officials sought to quash the probe, which is continuing.    Apart from Col. North, Rafael Quintero, a former CIA operative, was the station chief's frequent link with the airlift. The officer also testified that he met once in 1986 with retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, who ran the private network. That meeting dealt with the airstrip property in which the network had invested. The officer said Col. North separately had discussed the possibility of the CIA taking over the land and covering costs associated with the airstrip.    Gen. Secord has denied ever planning such a sale, but the issue remains important to investigators tracking the assets in the network and the disposition of profits from U.S. weapon sales to Iran. A Panamanian corporation Gen. Secord controlled through his business partner, Albert Hakim, was a major owner of the network's assets in Central America. Mr. Hakim also is expected to be questioned about certain Liberian-registered companies -- Gulf Marketing Consultants and Hyde Park Square -- he used to mask the finances of the operation. </TEXT></DOC>
