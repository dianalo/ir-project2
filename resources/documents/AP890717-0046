Steger and his five teammates from five countries, who hope tobegin the seven-month, 4,000-mile trek by Aug. 1, gave a last roundof hugs to well-wishers before departing Minneapolis-St. PaulInternational Airport at 9:30 p.m. Sunday with 13,000 pounds of gear.   Earlier Sunday, Soviet technicians repaired a faulty engine onthe four-engine cargo plane, a problem with a fuel flow device thaton Saturday threatened to ground the expedition for two days.   The team's 42 sled dogs were the last cargo to be loaded,sometimes with a struggle.   The group plans several stops in Latin America before beginningtheir trip across the bottom of the world. The team hopes thegrueling journey will rivet attention on international cooperation,as well as the continent's stark fragility.   ``Our mission is hope, hope in the strength and power ofinternational cooperation,'' Steger said at a news conference at theCollege of St. Catherine.   At the afternoon ceremony, Girl Scouts used scissors to sliceapart a painted tarp depicting the crew members' home countries _Britain, Japan, China, France, the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates _ and asked them to reassemble the mural at the end of theirexpedition.   At the same time, Steger, 44, wants to pursue a dream he says haslurked inside him for years: to conquer the world's last untamedfrontier. He calls the Antarctica traverse ``the last of the bigfirsts.''   Others have crossed Antarctica on snowmobiles and giant snowtractors, but this will be the first unmechanized attempt.   The venture has also drawn lots of publicity and money, withcorporations in the United States and France contributing nearly $10million. A $3.5 million aluminum boat will serve as a floatingembassy and communications base.   The team members are Steger, co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne ofFrance, Soviet scientist Victor Boyarsky, Englishman Geoff Somers,Keizo Funatsu of Japan, and Qin Dahe of China.   Oceanographers Mustafa Omar Moammar and Ibrahim Abdulhamid Alamof Saudi Arabia will travel with the team for a week on thecontinent's interior, then will spend the second half of theseven-month journey conducting experiments form the expedition'sship.   The trip south is to include stops in Havana; Lima, Peru; andBuenos Aires, Argentina.   Finally, from the tiny Argentine city of Rio Grande, the crewwill wait for the proper weather to fly to King George Island nearthe tip of the Antarctic peninsula, where the Chinese will behosting the trek's launch at the Great Wall research base. Thearbitrary point of Seal Nunataks was chosen as the trek's launchingpad.</TEXT></DOC>
