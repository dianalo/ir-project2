As he passes a group of 12-to-14-year-olds, many of whomhave their forelocks combed Hitler-like to the side, theyraise the &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; salute. It is their sign of respectfor the local skinheads, whose weeklong siege of twoapartment complexes for foreign workers and asylum seekers(to the applause of local residents) forced officials to busthe foreigners out of town.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We call them the `baby stormers,'&quot; the 19-year-oldneo-Nazi says with a smile. He says they are more numerousand radically right-wing than his &quot;older generation.&quot; He addsthat the two groups &quot;will see to it that the foreigners don'tcome back here.&quot;   The nationally televised siege in mid-September set off awave of attacks throughout Germany. After weeks of criticismfor the slow official response to the growing right-wingthreat, German police yesterday raided 114 homes of neo-Nazisin 32 cities. They seized knives, guns, clubs and hundreds ofpamphlets.   Before yesterday's raids, the Federal Criminal Office hadregistered 1,527 criminal offenses against foreigners for thefirst 10 months this year, mostly since the Hoyerswerdaincident. The toll included more than 275 acts of arson, 135injuries and three deaths.   After months of squabbling, eastern and western Germanshave finally found something to unite them -- the problem ofgrowing right-wing hatred of foreigners. Although only asmall minority have turned violent, most Germans worry thatthe rising numbers of asylum-seekers -- and a potential floodof new refugees from the Soviet Union -- could further drainan economy already burdened by absorbing eastern Germany. Asurprising percentage in polls -- between 25% and 40% --express &quot;understanding&quot; for the right-wing youths.   Some 203,000 foreigners applied for asylum in Germanyduring the first 10 months of this year, more than threetimes as many as in any other European country. But becauseGermany accepted only 7.5%, the government's burden hashardly been overwhelming. About two-thirds of the skinheads'attacks have occurred in western Germany, where economicdislocation has been less serious but where foreigners aremore numerous. (Western Germany has 80% of the asylum-seekersand more than 95% of the guest workers -- foreigners acceptedto make up for German labor shortages.)   The question is whether the problem is merely the ugliestof a unified Germany's temporary growing pains or a sicknessagain haunting a country that still hasn't fully come toterms with its past. One TV network, urging viewers to writeletters against &quot;Auslaenderhass&quot; (hatred of foreigners), madethe following appeal: &quot;We have exiled people from Germanyonce already, and we sent them to the gas chambers, and webellowed `Deutschland, Deutschland ueber alles' because webelieved that those others were strangers and not neighbors.It starts with prejudices, but it can end with manslaughter.Haven't we learned anything from our history?&quot;   As the appeal itself suggests, Germans have learned agreat deal. They note that the right-wing party in France ledby Jean-Marie Le Pen is bigger than any right-wing group inGermany (although right-wing parties are gaining). They addthat their unification was surprisingly free of nationalistbreast-beating. Still, the suddenness with which the problemarose and the clumsy political response underline a troublingfact -- a larger and more influential post-unificationGermany is also more volatile and socially troubled.   Thousands of Germans have taken to the streets todemonstrate against &quot;Auslaenderhass.&quot; The campaign is led bycelebrities. Model Claudia Schiffer, for example, said on agame show that she would visit an asylum home to play withthe children.   Yet the subject troubles many Germans. The game-show hostquickly changed the subject. And Haagen Dazs ice creamoutlets, which are selling pro-foreigner T-shirts and givingthe profits to foreigners who have been attacked, find theshirts sell only in Berlin. Skinheads haven't retaliatedagainst any ice cream shops, but old women in Munich,swinging umbrellas, have loudly assailed the Haagen Dazscampaign.   The political fight has turned nasty. For his efforts tochange Germany's constitution to stem the flow of refugees,Volker Ruehe, general secretary of the ruling ChristianDemocrats, has come under fire. A Social Democratic member ofparliament, Herta Dauebler Gmelin, called him &quot;aSchreibtischtaeter&quot; -- a &quot;writing-desk perpetrator,&quot; theGerman word for behind-the-scenes Nazi masterminds of theHolocaust. She said his statements encouraged neo-Nazis.   &quot;That's nonsense,&quot; Mr. Ruehe says. &quot;The violence hasstarted because there is a problem, and the skinheads andothers have many who sympathize with them. As long as youdon't address the problem, the trouble will become bigger.&quot;He notes that organized rings are bringing refugees toGermany because of its generous social subsidies. He alsocondemns the Social Democrats' proposal, which has beenaccepted, for opening &quot;collection camps&quot; where asylum-seekerswill stay while their applications are processed.   Mr. Ruehe wants automatic rejection of any refugeesrefused asylum by other European Community nations. He wouldalso ban asylum-seekers from newly democratic countries inEastern Europe and ban appeals of rejections. Although theBundestag has thus far spurned any such constitutionalchange, his views are popular with the public and even withsome political opponents.   In Huenxe, a town near the Dutch border, the SocialDemocratic mayor backs Mr. Ruehe's ideas. &quot;We have the samesituation that you {in the U.S.} have with Mexico,&quot; themayor, Rheinhold Peters, says. &quot;You can take measures that wearen't allowed because of our history -- putting up borderposts, busing back illegal immigrants by the thousands. Wemust face the fact that most of these asylum-seekers aren'tpolitically threatened but are here only for economicreasons. . . . We can't take more foreigners than we canintegrate. We don't even have enough housing for our youngpeople.&quot;   On Oct. 3, the first anniversary of reunification, threelocal youths threw a Molotov cocktail through a ground-floorwindow of the Huenxe asylum home. Two Lebanese children werebadly burned. &quot;Nothing like this ever happened to us inBeirut,&quot; says Mohammed Saado, their father.   Many Huenxe citizens are protecting the foreigners. Apastor, Martin Duscha, gave them sanctuary for a few nightsand organized a prayer meeting to promote understanding. Whenthe asylum-seekers returned to their apartments, where 55 ofthem live, local groups organized a guard service. But thecity's strongly traditional Shooting Club wouldn'tparticipate.   &quot;It may seem that we are well-off and haven't anything tofear from the foreigners,&quot; says Juergen Haupt, 56, who worksat a British Petroleum facility nearby. &quot;But we all workedhard and saved -- and we are all in debt. Many of us fearunemployment; my employer has laid off hundreds here. Germansneed to learn to live better with foreigners, but we alsocan't solve the problems of the world by taking them all in.&quot;   The atmosphere has changed radically in the Turkishguest-worker community of Lohberg, not far from Huenxe. TheTurks started coming in the 1960s to work in the nearby mine,and Germans started moving away. Those who remain have puttheir children -- about 30% of the local-school population --in all-German classes because they fear a decline ineducational standards. But the high pay and social-welfareprograms, such as socialized medicine and subsidized housing,made the Turks feel welcome -- until recently.   Now, some Turkish seventh-graders, talking excitedly, tellwild tales of beatings and rapes -- few of them true. &quot;Theconcern is out of proportion to anything that has happened,&quot;says their teacher, Hans Krings. &quot;But the fear is real.&quot;   Yet on a recent weekend, skinheads driving through townstopped to demolish a young Turk's car -- and then a newTurkish gang destroyed and burned the skinheads' car. Germanyouths still cruise by, shouting threats at Turkish girls andscrawling their gangs' names -- and swastikas -- on thesoot-covered apartment buildings.   But the slogan seen most often nowadays is &quot;BravoHoyerswerda.&quot; The city where the xenophobic attacks began nowis linked to TV images of skinheads stoning the housing offoreign workers and asylum-seekers, while neighbors cheeredthem on. Some even brought their children and gave themstones to throw. That support grew, says Friedbert Vogel, thelocal pastor, only after left-wing radicals from Berlinlaunched counter-demonstrations.   When &quot;Scharlie&quot; Schar and another skinhead in green bomberjackets swagger into the social-welfare office here, MarionPraetorius is waiting for them.   She offers them jobs. She also offers help in finding asubsidized apartment, a gift of used furniture and directionson where to get some nearly new clothes free. &quot;And if youhave any friends who need help, give them my phone number,&quot;says Ms. Praetorius, a social worker who thinks the best wayto fight right-wing attacks on foreigners is to befriend theyouths.   The two youths accept the handyman jobs at a day-carecenter warily. They correctly suspect that the city ishelping them because of their frightening success. &quot;No onepaid attention to us before,&quot; Mr. Schar says. &quot;Now peopleknow we are here, and we were surprised ourselves at how manypeople in society support us.&quot;   At a public meeting called by Hoyerswerda's mayor, some 25right-wing youths ridiculed a government that cared moreabout asylum-seekers than its own people. They argued thatGerman culture must be protected and asked for space in alocal building for their club. For security reasons, theysuggested a bomb shelter -- a Hitlerite bunker. Officialspromised to address their problems and help them find aclubhouse -- but not a bomb shelter.   The officials expect right-wing radicalism to fade here asthe economy improves and scapegoats aren't needed. MartinSchmidt, the mayor's deputy for cultural and social affairs,says that under the former East German government &quot;the youngpeople and others here weren't allowed to have opinionsexcept the official ones. Now, they can say whatever theywant, but they haven't had a proper education to formopinions. And they have traveled so little abroad that theyhaven't any real understanding of foreign cultures.&quot;   Mr. Schmidt is planning to open new sports clubs, athleticfacilities and youth theaters. His office is filled withtextbooks for new school courses in ethics and religion. Butfirst he must train the teachers. &quot;Ethics must be taught bypeople with demonstrated integrity,&quot; he says.   Education has a long way to go. &quot;Scharlie&quot; Schar insiststhat the skinheads are misunderstood. &quot;My father was theCommunist Party secretary at the gas plant, and he nevershowed me affection,&quot; he complains. &quot;All he cared about wasthe party and his career. But I am right-wing, and I'll showmy four-week-old son that sort of love I never had.&quot;   Despite the &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; salutes, he says Hitler isn'this model. &quot;He was too close to the capitalists,&quot; says Mr.Schar, who likes the socialist aspects of Nazism. He says theskinheads oppose pimps and prostitutes as well as Jews. Headds that the extermination of the Jews, which he suspectshas been exaggerated, went too far. &quot;They could have deportedthem all,&quot; he says.   Mr. Schmidt's program to help such youths doesn't pleaseeveryone. &quot;The skins say we are trying to neutralize them andget them off the streets, and others charge that we arerewarding their violence,&quot; he says. &quot;It will be a long timebefore we can make many in Hoyerswerda really likeforeigners, but perhaps we can at least remove some of thereasons they use to support that hatred.&quot;   He adds that he is more worried about &quot;the quiet middleclass that you don't catch&quot; with police raids like the onesyesterday. He is concerned about those who agree with theneo-Nazis' goals even though condemning their violence. &quot;Iworry about these people more than our youth because theseare the sorts of people who have elected extremistgovernments in Germany in the past. We're trying to designprograms to change attitudes among the broader public.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
