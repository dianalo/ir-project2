This FMP was developed and amended by theNorth Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and is implemented byNOAA through regulations appearing at 50 CFR part 674. The FMP also implements provisions of the Pacific Salmon Treaty and thePacific Salmon Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 3631 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Article III of the treaty requires that each Party conductits fisheries to prevent overfishing of the salmon stocks subject to thetreaty. The coho stocks being protected by this action are stocks subjectto the treaty (article I (a) and 1988 amendment of annex, IV, chapter 5).The troll fishery in the EEZ off Alaska and in Alaskan outside coastalwaters is the first fishery to intercept the returning coho salmon. Asof August 12, this fishery has harvested 1.1 million coho; a number 222percent above the 1971-1980 average harvest of 345 thousand by this date.In contrast, the harvests by the fisheries in the internal waters of SoutheastAlaska have done less well, with the cumulative gillnet catch being 65%above the average and the Ketchikan and Juneau sport fisheries having cumulativecatch-per-unit of efforts of 33 percent to 42 percent below average. Fewcoho have entered spawning streams at this date. In 1980, the Council amended section 8.3.1.4 of the FMP to provide foran area-wide closure of the entire troll fishery for 10 days to stabilizeor reduce coastal and offshore fishing effort on coho salmon unless anevaluation of the coho runs and harvests indicated a ``well above averagemagnitude and good movement inshore.'' The Council took this action incooperation with the Alaska Board of Fisheries (Board) so that the trollfishery in the EEZ and in State waters would be under consistent management.The Council intended that if the State issued a closure for coho, a similarclosure should be instituted for the EEZ, under the procedures outlinedin section 8.3.1.5. of the FMP and specified at 50 CFR 674.23. Further, regulations implementing the FMP (at 50 CFR 674.23(a)) also providethat the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) may modify the fishing timesand areas based on a determination by the Regional Director that the conditionof any salmon species in any part of the management area is substantiallydifferent from the condition anticipated in the FMP. In making such a determination,he may consider the following factors: (1) The effect of overall fishing effort within any part of the managementarea; (2) The catch per unit of effort and the rate of harvest; (3) The relative abundance of salmon stocks within the management area;(4) The condition of salmon stocks throughout their ranges; (5) Any other factors relevant to the conservation of salmon. Alaska has similar criteria for the fisheries in its waters. In the springof 1989, the Board established the following historical percentages asguidelines for the coho harvest by each type of commercial gear in SoutheastAlaska: Troll (61), purse seine (19), drift gill net (13), set gill net(7). The Board stated that its intention was that these allocation guidelinesbe met as closely as possible over the long term, and authorized the AlaskaDepartment of Fish and Game to adjust fishing times and areas to attemptto achieve these long-term allocation guidelines. Based on the harvests to date by the various commercial and recreationalfisheries, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game is closing the trollfishery in State waters for 10 days beginning at 0001 hours on August 14to ensure adequate migration of coho from coastal waters to internal watersand the spawning streams and to address allocation of coho salmon betweenthe offshore troll fishery and the troll, net, and recreational fisheriesof the internal waters of Alaska. The Regional Director, having reviewed the evidence of the coho harvestsand being aware of Alaska's proposed action, has determined that the effectof overall fishing effort, the catch per unit of effort, and the well-above-averagerate of harvest by the outside troll fleet requires a closure of the trollfishery in the EEZ. On Friday, August 11, 1989, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game andthe NMFS issued a joint announcement that the commercial troll fisherywould close for 10 days, beginning at 0001 hours ADT on August 14, 1989,and the Secretary is implementing the 10-day closure prescribed by thisaction. The closure will become effective after this notice has been filedfor public inspection with the Office of the Federal Register and the closurehas been publicized for 48 hours through procedures of the Alaska Departmentof Fish and Game. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters </ITAG>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that thecoho salmon stocks harvested in Southeastern Alaska will be subject toharm unless this notice takes effect promptly. He finds, therefore, thatit would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to provideadvance notice and a prior opportunity for public comment or to delay for30 days the effective date of this notice under the provisions of 5 U.S.C.553(b) and (d). However, 50 CFR 674.23(b)(3) requires the Secretary toaccept and consider public comments for 30 days after the effective dateof this notice. The aggregated data upon which this closure is based areavailable for public inspection at the address given above. If commentsare received, the Secretary will reconsider the necessity of this actionand will publish another notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> either confirming the notice's continued effect,modifying it, or rescinding it, unless the notice has already expired orbeen rescinded. This action is authorized by 50 CFR part 674 and complies with ExecutiveOrder 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 674 </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, International organizations, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 3631 <T3>et seq.;</T3> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 11, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
