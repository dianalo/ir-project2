BrowningStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/31/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP LABORTRANSPORTATION, TRUCK AND SHIP LINES, RAILROADS (TRA) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Barely two weeks after student strikes forced him to delay his program of economic and social change, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac now faces a fresh challenge to his authority, this time from disgruntled unions.    Striking railway workers yesterday rejected a compromise, ensuring that their crippling stoppage would continue into its 14th day today. At the same time, seamen and miners continued separate strikes, and a key electrical workers' union announced a daylong strike for next Tuesday.    Auto makers, steel companies and retailers warn that unless the rail strike is resolved by the end of the holiday season, they will begin posting significant losses. France's railways are essential to a cross section of the French economy. They deliver, for example, six out of 10 cars and 80% of all Perrier water. With train service cut to about one-fifth to one-third of normal levels, the government has had to use special buses to replace train service for vacation travelers, and mail arrives late.    But the strikes are important for an even broader reason. Mr. Chirac's government was elected this past March on the promise of broad economic change in this traditionally state-dominated country. One part of that change is control of inflation.    Mr. Chirac, who canceled his year-end vacation to deal with the rail strike, has vowed to keep prices from rising much past 2% a year. To do that, he has ordered that all public-sector wage increases be kept below 3%, and has directed the abolition of such labor practices as promotions based on seniority rather than merit.    It is the wage controls and the end of seniority-based promotions that sparked the rail strike, and which threaten to spark further public-service strikes later this year. Based on Mr. Chirac's decision to delay his legislative program in the face of student demonstrations, and later to grant a subsidy of more than the equivalent to $310 million to farmers, unions are betting that he will back down on labor relations as well. But Mr. Chirac realizes that if he is to keep any authority as prime minister, he must appear to handle the strikes firmly.    &quot;It is the entire economic policy of the government that is in question,&quot; said one official close to the prime minister. &quot;We must remain firm.&quot;    Even if some industries and travelers must suffer, officials say, the government is prepared for a long strike rather than make a basic concession in what is widely seen here as a test case.    The government has, however, offered one compromise. On Monday night it named a mediator, and said it would let him decide how much weight should be given to seniority and how much to merit in promotions. Union leaders rejected that offer, demanding that the entire promotion plan be canceled.    Some government officials said privately they hope that by giving ground on promotions, they can make their salary policy stick, which would set a precedent for later negotiations.    Despite the dispute, the unions agreed to meet with the mediator today. They also showed up yesterday for fresh negotiations with railroad management on working conditions. They demanded that those talks also reopen a salary agreement reached with the rail system earlier this year.    One reason that union leaders are taking a hard line now is that the rail strike began spontaneously, outside the unions' control, and spread quickly. Strikers include almost all train engineers and 30% of all rail employees.    Realizing that they had underestimated the depth of feeling among some workers, the unions have hardened their positions. In addition to promotions and salaries, rail workers also want shorter hours, better food and lodging on the nights they must spend away from home, and more say work in schedules that take them out of town. </TEXT></DOC>
