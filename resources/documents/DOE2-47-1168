Althoughfuels alternative to petroleum have been developed since the Oil Crisis,the dependence of automotive fuel on petroleum has been almost unchanged.Synthesis of gasoline from coal has been studied in South Africa andthat from natural gas has been made in New Zealand since 1985. The synthesisof gasoline may be technically a measure to counter the future oil crisis,setting aside the economic question. Although natural gas cars are usedin oil-producing countries, the mileage is short. In West Germany, gasolinecontaining 3% of methanol accounts for 70% of the total sales amount.In Brazil, ethanol produced from sugarcane is blended to gasoline. Thereare problems in the steady production and production cost of methanol,though the technical alternative is promising. Both methanol and naturalgas have environmental advantages. An electric automobile is most superiorin respect to non-pollution, but it has not spread so much. The aim ofworldwide development of new energy is shifting from alternative fuelto petroleum to the environmental measures. (5 figs, 5 tabs, 5 photo,3 refs.)</TEXT></DOC>
