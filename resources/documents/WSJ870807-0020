Just listen to the cacophony of voices emanating from Wall Street in the wake of the Big Three's earnings reports two weeks ago.    Some analysts have turned bullish on General Motors because it had a lousy second quarter, but better than they expected. Some have turned cool toward Ford Motor because it had a record quarter, but didn't exceed expectations. One analyst just downgraded Chrysler, while another just added the company to its &quot;emphasis list.&quot;    In truth, a strong case can be built for buying any of the Big Three stocks right now, even though they dropped yesterday as the companies prepared to launch a costly year-end clearance sale on their cars. But there's such diversity of opinion on all three that the stocks could move erratically, as investors weigh reason (about what the earnings numbers mean), hunches (about the possibility of a strike next month) and rumor (about anything).    Take GM, whose stock declined 7/8 to 87 7/8 yesterday. Last Friday the stock jumped amid rumors that Chairman Roger B. Smith was about to announce early retirement because of a stress-induced, debilitating skin rash. Wall Street has voiced enough doubts about Mr. Smith that some investors wouldn't mind a replacement. But on Wednesday Mr. Smith defused the latest Roger Rumor by appearing fit and relaxed while addressing a University of Michigan auto seminar.    On a more fundamental level, analysts differ widely on GM. &quot;I've upgraded GM from a sell to a buy,&quot; says Ronald A. Glantz, of San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities. He reasons that GM's second-quarter earnings of $2.80 a share, while still below par, were far higher than all analysts expected. He believes the stock will get a boost when an expected accounting change this fall adds around $2.50 a share to earnings, even though it won't bring in an extra dime of cash.    &quot;Unfortunately, investors look at earnings rather than cash flow,&quot; says Mr. Glantz. &quot;Time and again, when companies liberalize their accounting, the stocks have done well.&quot;    The accounting change GM is considering -- but hasn't yet decided on -- is accelerating its depreciation and amortization schedules, which are more conservative than Ford's and Chrysler's. &quot;People who understand this say we should have changed a long time ago,&quot; says a spokesman.    But the prospective change concerns David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert. He figures that accounting changes GM already has made during the past year, including an increase in the residual value of cars leased by General Motors Acceptance Corp., already have added $2.40 a share to annual earnings.    &quot;Some earnings are coming out of the car department, and some out of the accounting department,&quot; says Mr. Healy. &quot;I guess you can make a case for the (accounting) changes, but they all seem to be in one direction.&quot; He's neutral on GM, but recommends Ford and Chrysler.    Nearly every analyst likes Ford, which closed yesterday at 104 3/4, off 1/2. Its price-earnings ratio of 6 is the lowest of the Big Three. And with $9.1 billion of cash, analysts figure, Ford could announce another big share buy-back after it gets a new labor contract.    But Wendy Beale of Smith Barney, Harris Upham reasons that Ford has done so spectacularly well in the past year that it has lost the potential for pleasant surprises. &quot;If you want to own an auto stock,&quot; she says,&quot;you may want to get into another one.&quot;    Her first choice is GM. She notes that only 42% of GM's stock is owned by institutions, compared with about 65% for Chrysler and 62% for Ford. Ms. Beale bets that as institutions move back into GM, the stock will rise.    Opinion is divided on Chrysler, which fell 1/4 yesterday to 39 1/2. &quot;It had the most amazing second quarter,&quot; says Mr. Glantz, who just added Chrysler to the Montgomery Securities emphasis list. Analysts didn't figure on the new stretched minivans and bigger engines being so profitable, he says, and thus underestimated earnings.    But on Tuesday, Kidder Peabody's Jack Kirnan dropped Chrysler to a &quot;hold&quot; rating. Vans and trucks are selling well, he concedes, but Chrysler's car sales &quot;have been very disappointing.&quot; He also figures Chrysler will take longer than expected to straighten out American Motors, which it acquired Wednesday.    Beyond all this, the Big Three face major uncertainties in the next few weeks. The year-end fire sale will hurt earnings at all three -- especially at GM, where some analysts were predicting a third consecutive third-quarter operating loss even before the sale was announced.    GM and Ford face a possible strike by the United Auto Workers when their contracts expire Sept. 14; Chrysler is negotiating only in Canada, but a strike there could shut down the entire company. A short strike wouldn't likely have a lasting effect on auto makers' earnings or stock prices, but a longer walkout could jeopardize car makers' competitive positions. </TEXT></DOC>
