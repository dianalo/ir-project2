They argue that the staggering amounts of debt acquired by manycompanies as a result of these transactions, called leveragedbuyouts or LBOs, will have to be repaid somehow, even if it meansselling profitable assets, cutting payrolls and reducing benefitssuch as health-care insurance.   Some LBO critics argue that the impact would multiply if thenation plunges into a recession, forcing these highly indebtedcompanies to cut more deeply into the core of their businesses inorder to meet debt payments.   These warnings come at a time that many U.S. companies areaggressively cutting costs to survive in an increasingly competitiveworld economy and may not be able to afford added debt burdens.   ``There is a casino society atmosphere in this country, becauseshareholders want to make a killing,'' said Henry Schechter, anAFL-CIO economist in Washington. ``The end result is billions ofdebt. We've already had cases in which thousands of jobs are lost.''   As examples, he said, the $4.2 billion LBO of Safeway Stores Inc.left thousands of workers unemployed in Texas because property therewas sold to pay off debt. A Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. restructuringto thwart a hostile takeover, which saddled the company with $3.6billion in debt, led the company to close factories and lay offhundreds of employees.   The frenzy of company restructurings that have altered the U.S.economic landscape this decade already had raised some of theseissues. Many that have restructured into privately-held companiesemerge as stronger because management is more focused on their corebusinesses and faces fewer pressures for short-term profit.   Retailer R.H. Macy andamp; Co., for example, which went private in a$3.6 billion LBO in 1985, is regarded as one of the best-managedchains in the industry. Seven-Up Co., which languished underconglomerate owner Philip Morris Cos., increased productivity andtrimmed waste after it was sold in an LBO two years ago.   But the speed and size of deals announced just in the past fewweeks, notably a proposed $20 billion LBO of RJR Nabisco Inc., haveraised fears of upheavals in the workforce that had not been widelyenvisioned before.   ``I don't think this is good, frankly,'' said Edith Weiner, apartner in Weiner, Edrich Brown Inc., a New York-based businessconsulting firm that focuses on long-range trends.   ``If one company does this to restructure and solve problems ofnon-productivity, that's one thing, but the evidence is that's notthe case anymore,'' she said. ``It's gotten to the point where we'renot talking about the long-term interests of the economy at all.''   Rising concern about the impact of LBOs also coincides with alabor force increasingly comprised of working couples, who want morejob-related benefits for themselves and their children.   Some economists say these are colliding trends that already havecaused management-labor conflicts and signal a declining standard ofliving for a broad spectrum of American wage-earners.   ``The shift from equity to debt financing is having a majorimpact on workforces,'' said Richard Belous, a senior economist atthe National Planning Association, a Washington-based researchconcern.   ``You have to pay debt. If you have a balance sheet which ishighly leveraged, you've lost financial flexibility,'' he said.``How do you regain it? You march into head of human resources andregain flexibility that way.''   For example, he said, many companies are relying increasingly onpart-time, temporary workers who receive less pay and little or nobenefits. The relatively slow growth of wages in the past few yearsis a partial reflection of this trend, he said.   Richard Miners, partner and chief operating officer at Goodrich andamp;Sherwood, a human resources consulting firm in New York, said manyLBO companies cannot afford to give generous benefits-wage packages.   ``They may offer insurance but employees must contribute,'' hesaid. ``When it comes time to give raises, they'll give less thanthe norm. They'll eliminate a lot of jobs to fine tune the machinethey have.''   Although some companies will benefit with increased productivity,he said, longer-term consequences are unclear. Many employees couldgrow bitter and disloyal, resulting in declining productivity.   ``Some of these companies, all they care about is the service ofthe debt,'' Miners said. ``The pride factor workers may have had inthe past could disappear.''</TEXT></DOC>
