A study by the Environmental Defense Fund said nitrate compoundsfrom the atmosphere _ originating mostly as nitric acid _contribute 25 percent of the total nitrogen input to CheasapeakeBay, compared with 34 percent from fertilizers and 23 percent frommunicipal sewage and industrial discharges.   Nitrates act as fertilizers, encouraging ``blooms'' of algaethat use up oxygen dissolved in the water and making it difficultfor other plants and fish to live.   These airborne compounds also are contributing to problems inDelaware Bay, Albemarle-Pamlico Sound in North Carolina, LongIsland Sound between New York and Connecticut and the New YorkBight in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey, thegroup's scientists said.   ``The problem of enhanced primary productivity from atmosphericnitrogen inputs appears to be widespread along the AtlanticSeaboard,'' the fund's report said.   Release of the report kicked off three days of rallies, pressconferences and other events by environmental groups timed tocoincide with this week's visit to Washington by Canadian PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney.   Canada, supported by U.S. environmentalists, for years has beenunsuccessfully pressing the United States to act against thepollution precursors that form acid rain and flow northward acrossthe border before falling on Canada.   The most-often-mentioned precursor is sulfur dioxide, whichturns into sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. Sulfur dioxide ismostly emitted by coal-burning power plants, but an estimatedone-third of the rainfall acidity in the eastern United Statesactually comes from oxides of nitrogen, which become nitric acid inthe atmosphere.   Nationwide, about one-third of nitrigen oxides originate inpower plant emissions, one-third in motor vehicle exhaust andone-seventh in industrial emnissions.   Today's report was the first to estimate the input to ChesapeakeBay of nitrates originating in the atmosphere not only as directrain and other deposition on the bay itself _ an estimated 9,150tons per year _ but also in runoff from the land of the bay'swatershed _ 29,400 tons per year. The fund estimated that 154,000tons of nitrogen compounds from all sources wind up in the bay.   The total of 154,000 tons was in the range of estimates given bythe joint federal-state Chesapeake Bay pollution control program,92,000 tons to 198,000 tons.   The fund called on the joint program to adopt measures aimed atreducing atmospheric deposition of nitrogen compounds to the bayand its watershed by 40 percent. The program already has adopted agoal of reducing nitrogen and phosphorous discharges to the bay by40 percent.   At the Environmental Protection Agency, spokesman Chris Ricesaid no agency expert had had a chance to study the fund's reportand the EPA therefore was not in a position to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
