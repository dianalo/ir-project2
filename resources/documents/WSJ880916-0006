A Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesman in Salt Lake City said Chicago-based Morton Thiokol turned over documents to the federal panel within the last few weeks but that no witnesses have been called yet. Meanwhile, an official of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said he had been contacted earlier by the FBI in connection with the investigation.    Earlier this week two former employees complained in separate lawsuits filed here that Morton Thiokol officials had wrongfully dismissed them after they raised safety concerns about the rocket motor in 1986 and 1987. Earlier this month a federal judge in Utah dismissed claims for $3 billion by a former senior Morton Thiokol engineer that company officials defamed him after he voiced concerns about the safety of the booster rocket that exploded.    The grand jury activity comes just weeks before the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is scheduled to launch the redesigned space vehicle. The last manned space shuttle launch ended in disaster when the Challenger exploded after liftoff Jan. 28, 1986, killing seven astronauts.    NASA administrator James Fletcher, said the FBI investigation wouldn't affect the forthcoming launch of the space shuttle Discovery. &quot;That (booster) design is in good shape,&quot; he said. He attributed the allegations to &quot;disgruntled employees.&quot; Nevertheless, he said he believed NASA's inspector general would investigate the charges too.    A spokesman for Morton Thiokol said the company doesn't discuss matters &quot;in litigation or with the potential to be litigated.&quot; But he said that if a federal investigation is under way Morton Thiokol would cooperate. The spokesman said Morton Thiokol is confident the redesigned space shuttle is safe and that the company didn't suppress any safety concerns from its employees on the project.    &quot;The redesign effort is the most scrutinized effort that ever went on in the rocket propulsion industry,&quot; the spokesman said.    But several former employees who worked at Morton Thiokol's Brigham City, Utah, plant for a special safety review unit said yesterday that they had trouble getting senior Morton Thiokol officials to pay attention to their concerns.    Ronald Clary, a structural engineer who worked for seven months with the Systems Safety Analysis Unit at the Utah plant, said in an interview yesterday, &quot;There was a lot of suppression of hazards and safety concerns&quot; raised by members of the unit. &quot;Intentionally or for whatever reason, those things never got into the record,&quot; said Mr. Clary.    Rakeh Chopra, another engineer who worked with the unit, said he relayed some of his concern about the safety of the rocket casing to FBI investigators after they were ignored by Morton Thiokol officials. Mr. Chopra, who now lives in Maryland, said one of his recommendations involved additional study of the long-term durability of the casing, which is supposed to be reusable for up to 20 launches. &quot;I believe that was never carried out,&quot; he said. &quot;I think there was a public relations concern&quot; about taking such action.    J.R. Thompson, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said in an interview yesterday he was told a year ago that the FBI was looking into allegations Morton Thiokol had hushed up employees' safety concerns. Mr. Thompson said he met briefly with FBI officials at the time, but has had no contact since. A senior Morton Thiokol official, who declined to be identified, said the company has been providing the FBI with documents for the past year.    Mr. Thompson said NASA has had a team of 25 to 30 engineers and others working in Brigham City for the past two years. &quot;We've got so many people looking at things out there that I'm extremely confident there's no piece of data that somebody suppressed,&quot; he said.    Wayne Tilse, an engineer who now lives in Seattle, said in an interview yesterday that when he worked on the booster rocket safety unit in early 1987 he raised a number of concerns about the durability of the rocket casing. &quot;I couldn't even succeed in getting a draft of my report typed,&quot; he said. Mr. Tilse said he ended up taking a hand-written draft of his report to Morton Thiokol officials. &quot;The initial reaction was, 'Well, this isn't a problem,'&quot; he said.    Many of the concerns raised by the former Thiokol employees were first reported in a lengthy article by the Seattle Times in May. Other than the continuing FBI investigation and grand jury inquiry, however, it isn't clear whether the controversy has had any impact on the continuing effort to prepare the shuttle for the next launch. The employee concerns were raised anew in lawsuits filed here this week by Steven Agee, a former Thiokol engineer, and Anthony W. Laine, a physicist who worked on the shuttle project.    In his lawsuit Mr. Agee said engineers with the safety unit were supposed to make their evaluation directly to NASA but that Morton Thiokol officials quashed most of their reports. Mr. Agee said he personally filed 221 Catastrophic Hazard Analyses related to the booster rocket, none of which made it to NASA. In all, he said the unit's engineers wrote more than 2,000 reports, mostly hazard analyses, and Morton Thiokol forwarded fewer than 50 to NASA.    During part of his five-month tenure with the unit Mr. Agee worked as a paid informant for the FBI, wearing a hidden tape recorder. He also turned over hundreds of project documents to the federal investigators and recruited additional informants before he was fired by Thiokol in March of 1987.    In Utah the FBI spokesman said the federal investigation could last for some time. &quot;We're looking at an even longer investigation than we anticipated,&quot; he said. &quot;Running through all these documents is a laborious process.&quot;    ---   Judith Valente in Chicago and Bob Davis in Washington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
