WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis was jeered Saturdayas he appealed for votes from homosexual political activists, someof whom confronted him for supporting a policy making it difficultfor gay couples to be foster parents.   Dukakis, speaking to several dozen people at a meeting of a gaypolitical action committee, promised, ``You're going to be deeplyinvolved in what we do.''   However, the Massachusetts governor was confronted over a policyin his state giving low priority to homosexual couples as fosterparents. The policy gives higher priority to heterosexual coupleswith children and relatives of the child needing placement.   Dukakis, campaigning for gay support in California's June 7primary, was met with some hisses and occasional shouts of protestas he explained his position on foster care.   Dukakis also pointed to his record of support for spending moneyto combat the deadly AIDS disease, whose chief victims have beenhomosexual men. He also said Massachusetts spends more money perAIDS case than any other state.   He called AIDS ``the most serious public health problem we'vehad in our lifetime.''   Dukakis said he had vetoed legislation as governor that bannedhomosexual couples from providing foster care, but said he backedthe policy in effect that gives first priority to heterosexualcouples with child raising experience, and above that, relatives ofthe child in need of care.   When asked repeatedly why he favored that policy, Dukakis said``because I think it's best, all things being equal, for a child togrow up in a household with a mother and father and otherchildren.''   Dukakis added that his policy does not prohibit gays frombecoming foster parents if they are best for the child, but Dukakisaides acknowledged the Massachusetts policy effectively preventsgays from becoming foster parents in most cases.   A handful of protesters greeted the Massachusetts governoroutside a hotel. Inside, one man shouted, ``bigot,'' and anotheryelled, ``You're anti-gay. Why don't you admit it?''   Dukakis was warmly endorsed by Jean O'Leary, executive directorof a group called National Gay Rights Advocates.   ``We have in Mike Dukakis a candidate who is instinctivelysupportive, who has a good record on gay rights, who wants oursupport and who can win,'' she said. ``Let's stop comparing MichaelDukakis with Jesse Jackson and start comparing him with GeorgeBush.''   Dukakis said he would not support an executive order banningdiscrimination based on sexual orientation, but said he believedsuch discrimination was already prohibited by the U.S. Constitution.   Dukakis aides said they were pleased with the meeting despitethe protests.   ``I thought it was very good, very open. I thought GovernorDukakis dealt with the community's concerns very honestly,'' saidAlice Travis, the campaign's national political coordinator.   At a news conference later in Pasadena, Dukakis responded tocriticism from Vice President George Bush, the expected Republicannominee, who has blasted Dukakis for opposing weapons systems andsaid the Democrat's approach to defense amounted to ``wishfulthinking.''   ``Anybody who sat there and did nothing while we traded arms tothe Ayatollah (Khomeini) had better not be lecturing other peopleabout naivete and wishful thinking,'' Dukakis said, referring toBush's role in the Iran-Contra affair.   Dukakis also faced questions on his opposition to the deathpenalty as he appeared with Californa Attorney General John Van deKamp, who endorsed him.   The Massachusetts governor said he opposed the death penalty,``because I don't believe in killing people. There are other waysof stopping violent crime.''</TEXT></DOC>
