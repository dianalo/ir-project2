With few exceptions, each time one of the government statisticsmills issues a discouraging report on the economy, the stock market takes offtoward a new high. And when politicians talk about tax cuts -- which wouldreduce burdens on producers of wealth -- the market takes a dive.;  Confusing? Sure. Illogical? Not necessarily.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WHY GLUM ECONOMIC NEWS CAN LIFT STOCKS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     In Wall Street's orthodox view, the stock market, reflecting collectiveinvestor opinion about the prospects for corporate profits, looks to thefuture, not to the past or present. And what it sees, with inflation modestand some interest rates at the lowest levels in 14 years, is an economicrecovery ahead that will lift profits and thereby support today's valuations.;  &quot;I think it's an unmistakable recovery sign,&quot; said Lawrence Kudlow, chiefeconomist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., referring to the stock market's ebullience.&quot;There's no doubt in my mind the recession's over.&quot;;   History tends tosupport this conclusion, with the stock market enjoying a reputation as one ofthe better predictors of the economy.;   But there is at least one otherpossible explanation for the elevated stock market. This is that the market isartificially high, benefiting in part from over-optimism about a recovery thatstruggles ahead, &quot;but in the face of a 50-mile-an-hour head wind,&quot; as AlanGreenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week, referring to thereluctance of some banks to lend.;   The Dow Jones industrials are selling at30 times the earnings of their latest 12 months -- more than twice the ratioof a year ago -- though the market has declined modestly in the last threesessions. In addition, the trading volume in over-the-counter stocks hassurpassed that on the New York Stock Exchange for two straight weeks.;   Alsocontributing to the notion that stock prices are too high is evidence thatsavers, confronting drastically reduced returns on certificates of deposit andTreasury bills, are pouring money into equities. Some of this is movingdirectly into stocks, and some is channeled through mutual funds.;   CharlesClough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., is one person onWall Street who has turned cautious about the stock market rally, which hesays may have gotten ahead of itself based on economic fundamentals.;   &quot;Thereis some speculation going on, and that's bothersome,&quot; Clough said. He addedthat while much of the hyperactivity was in one industry, biotechnology, hewas concerned that the market might be overly optimistic about the pace ofeconomic recovery.;   He noted that the Fed has been easing monetary policy,pushing interest rates down, for a year, but still has a negligible rebound toshow for it.;   These days, reports of a weak recovery tend to raise stockprices, since it is assumed that the news increases the likelihood of furthereasing by the Federal Reserve.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911105  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  486  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, November 5, 199100310039,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
