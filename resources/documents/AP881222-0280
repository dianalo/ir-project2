BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of 35 congressmen _ most of them fromtextile states _ has complained to top banking and securityofficials about Farley Inc.'s unsolicited $1.4 billion bid for WestPoint-Pepperell Inc., claiming the proposed deal would weaken thenation's battle against textile imports.   The letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan andSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder includesgeneral worries about leveraged buyouts and also echoes Pepperell'sspecific charges that the bid is too heavily financed by debt.   Among those who signed the letter sent this week are Rep. RichardRay, D-Ga., whose district includes Pepperell's headquarters in WestPoint, Ga., and Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, who will chair theHouse Banking Committee in the new Congress.   Meanwhile, Farley on Thursday again extended its $48-per-shareoffer until Jan. 4. The offer originally was made in October, andhas been extended past several expiration dates.   And Pepperell's board set a special shareholders meeting for Feb.25. At the meeting, Farley will attempt to replace current boardmembers with its own nominees who would be expected to rescindPepperell's anti-takeover defenses.   Leveraged buyouts, in which acquisitions are financed withborrowed money secured by the target's cash flow or assets, ``may besaddling corporations with a dangerous level of debt which willrestrict their ability to modernize and to weather economicdownturns,'' the congressmen's letter said.   The 1934 Securities Exchange Act ``directed the Federal ReserveBoard to issue margin regulations to limit the excessive use ofcredit in securities transactions,'' the letter said. ``Now, morethan ever, Congress expects the Federal Reserve Board and theSecurities and Exchange Commission to assure that those marginregulations are enforced.''   Pepperell has filed suit trying to block Farley's bid, claimingamong other things that the offer violates those regulations, but afederal district judge ruled against the Georgia company. The casehas been appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals whichhas set a Jan. 11 hearing date.   ``By any objective measure, West Point-Pepperell is a growing andhealthy company,'' the letter says, but Farley's plans to break upthe company after a takeover means ``we risk losing one of thestrongest U.S. competitors in the world's textile market.''   Textile manufacturers long have complained about what they see asunfair foreign competition, and the signers of the letter includesome of the leaders in unsuccessful efforts to erect import quotas.   Of the signers, 21 of the congressmen are from North Carolina,South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama _ all of which have aconcentration of the nation's textile industry.   Chicago-based Farley, a privately owned conglomerate thatmanufactures such items as Fruit of the Loom underwear and AcmeBoots, said Thursday it had been tendered or already owns about 58percent of Pepperell's outstanding stock.   Farley also has succeeded in forcing Pepperell to call thespecial shareholders meeting, getting holders of more than 25percent of the outstanding stock to call for the session.   Pepperell, the nation's largest publicly owned textile company,has about 29.4 million outstanding shares. Its products include GoldToe socks, Arrow shirts and Martex towels.</TEXT></DOC>
