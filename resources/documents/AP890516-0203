Teri Lawrence and her baby, William Zachery, were ``doing verywell'' Tuesday night at Northside Hospital in Atlanta, saidspokeswoman Carol King.   Mrs. Lawrence said she woke at 7 a.m. Tuesday to realize thather baby was on its way, Ms. King said. But her husband, Edwin,already had left for work and Mrs. Lawrence couldn't get to thetelephone to call an ambulance.   That's when her daughter Amanda, 7, dialed the operator forhelp, Ms. King said. The operator got the call at 7:32 a.m. andpatched the call through to 911 operators in Cobb County.   The Lawrences live in the northwestern Atlanta suburb ofAcworth, in Bartow County, and the 911 operators told Amanda how tohelp her mother.   ``I think I did a great job, and it was a good idea I helpedlittle Zachery be born,'' Amanda said in a telephone interview fromthe hospital Tuesday night. ``I was shocked, but I knew what wasgoing on, even though he came out a little purplish, purple-blue. Ieven got to hold him.''   Mrs. Lawrence could not be interviewed late Tuesday because shewas asleep.   ``The mother was doing OK as far as the labor was concerned, butAmanda was providing help the mother couldn't give herself,'' Ms.King said. ``She had to give directions to the house, which was onstreets that aren't marked, and get towels for her mom and unlockedthe doors for the ambulance.''   ``We just kept her on the line to monitor the situation while wecalled Bartow to dispatch emergency vehicles,'' said Cobb Countypolice supervisor Julia Kilgore.   Rescue workers arrived at the Acworth home at 7:50 a.m., and theLawrences were on their way to the hospital at 8:09 a.m., officialssaid.   Mrs. Lawrence and her baby are expected to go home Wednesday,she said. Through it all, Amanda remained ``amazingly calm,'' Ms.King said.   ``Her mom says Amanda really hasn't grasped how important a roleshe played,'' Ms. King said. ``Amanda says she just talked on thephone.''   Ms. King said Amanda had attended a childbirthing course severalweeks earlier, when the Lawrences couldn't find a baby sitter forAmanda, so they brought her, too.   ``She had seen the film and heard the discussion, so she wasaware of some of what was happening,'' Ms. King said.   ``I'm just so proud of her,'' Edwin Lawrence said of hisdaughter. ``If she hadn't been there ... she was just about toleave for school when my wife had a severe contraction. Amanda wasfine about it until her mother started carrying on a little fromthe pain, but the operator kept her calm.''</TEXT></DOC>
