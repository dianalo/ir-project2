It's clear that no one is going to get a majority of the delegates to this summer's national convention. But if one candidate got 40% of the delegates -- leaving him more than 400 short of the 2,082 needed to win the presidential nomination -- he clearly would be the front-runner and would be within striking distance of negotiating his way to a majority.    It isn't at all certain, however, that anyone will be able to get even 40% of the delegates by June 7, when the primaries end. The candidate best positioned to achieve that level -- Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis -- stumbled badly in the Illinois primary on Tuesday and now faces a formidable challenge: He must win half the remaining delegates up for grabs just to get 40%, or 1,665 delegates.    &quot;The arithmetic for anyone to win this is very, very difficult,&quot; says Bill Carrick, campaign manager for Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri. &quot;It's a situation unlike anything we've ever faced before.&quot;    The puzzle for the Democrats is that their process doesn't winnow very fast. They began with eight candidates. They still have five.    &quot;The Republicans have it locked up,&quot; says Elaine Kamarck, a student of the nomination process and former deputy manager of the Bruce Babbitt campaign. &quot;We're just staggering around.&quot;    For the GOP, it's all but official: The candidate will be Vice President George Bush. His principal rivals, Sen. Robert Dole and former Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson, were meeting with advisers yesterday to figure out how to bring their campaigns to graceful conclusions.    The Democrats move on.    Kirk O'Donnell, a Democratic strategist, says he can't remember a campaign -- ever -- when candidates managed so many comebacks. He figures it may be Mr. Gephardt's turn March 26, when Michigan Democrats begin choosing delegates at caucuses.    Mr. Dukakis faces a kind of political tag-team match. At every turn, he is forced to wrestle with another candidate. In Illinois, it was the unlikely figure of favorite-son Sen. Paul Simon, who hadn't even competed in the 20 Super Tuesday contests and who will never have enough delegates to be a serious contender.    Now, in the next contest, the Michigan caucuses on March 26, he must tangle with Rep. Gephardt, who many believe doesn't have enough cash to remain a major contender. But, in Michigan, Mr. Gephardt has a message: his get-tough proposals aimed at the nation's foreign trade competitors.    And coasting along, picking up delegates all the way, is the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who may have more than 1,000 of them by the time the deal-makers go to work.    More puzzling is the outlook for Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, who picked up 335 delegates in his Southern bailiwick but seems to have no place to go now. &quot;He's cotton you can't sell in a wool state,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a Republican theoretician. An early Gore move: He's scheduled to fly to Puerto Rico tomorrow in search of 51 delegates to be chosen in a primary Sunday.    &quot;We must all be patient,&quot; says Richard Moe, a senior Gephardt adviser. &quot;This campaign has had a lot of twists and turns, and there are going to be a lot more. The process has to be played out all the way.&quot;    The contest goes almost endlessly from one crucial test to another. With Michigan, and Pennsylvania and New York to follow, the candidates will begin fighting it out among traditional Democratic voters in the big industrial states.    The Democratic candidates still have a lot to prove.    Gov. Dukakis has yet to deliver a compelling message or prove he can win blue-collar votes, a fundamental constituency in these old states. On the other hand, in Florida Mr. Dukakis ran well among Jewish voters, another important constituency, particularly in New York.    For all the smoothness of his campaign this time, Mr. Jackson still has trouble reaching out to white voters or calming their fears about him, according to NBC exit polls. In Illinois, his home state, he attracted only 7% of the white vote. His best showing with white voters so far has been among liberals in the North. In Massachusetts, for example, he carried 19% of the white vote.    Mr. Gephardt is credited with the most-arresting message of any of the candidates -- his proposal to hold out the threat of retaliation against unfair trading partners. It worked in Iowa, but was a disappointment on Super Tuesday. Now it comes into play again in Michigan. If it doesn't work with auto workers, it's hard to believe it will work with anyone.    But beneath the surface, Mr. Dukakis's forces are trying to lure the leadership of the United Auto Workers, an important element of the Gephardt victory in Iowa, away from the Missouri lawmaker. Mr. Gephardt's strategists don't think the Dukakis gambit will work. &quot;There's no union in the country that's more loyal to its allies than the UAW,&quot; says Mr. Carrick, the Gephardt campaign chief.    To the Dukakis campaign, the challenge in the weeks ahead is simple enough: &quot;We have to demonstrate that we're the winner and that we're going to be the nominee,&quot; says Susan Estrich, the campaign manager. &quot;At that point, the delegates will either come to us or we'll go after them.&quot;    Party chairman Paul Kirk already is planning a meeting with all the principals after the June 7 primaries to select the nominee and avoid a wild, disruptive convention.    A key element in the post-primary dynamics will be the 645 so-called super-delegates: 362 members of the Democratic National Committee, 253 members of Congress, 25 Democratic governors and five party luminaries (Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, Thomas O'Neill, Mike Mansfield and Carl Albert).    None is pledged. Only about 100 of the Democratic National Committee members have given some commitment, public orprivate. Many of the 80 lawmakers who have sided with Mr. Gephardt are doing so as a holding action. &quot;The more talk there is about a brokered convention,&quot; says Mark Siegel, a DNC member from the District of Columbia, &quot;the more incentive there is for the super delegates to stay uncommitted.&quot;    ---                        The Road Ahead                                           DEMOCRATIC CONTEST                                    DELEGATES DATE                   STATE                AT STAKE March 26               Michigan                  138 April 5                Wisconsin                  81 April 19               New York                  255 April 26               Pennsylvania              178 May 3                  Ohio                      159                        Washington, D.C.           16                        Indiana                    79 June 7                 California                314                        New Jersey                109 NOTE: Does not include all remaining contests   ---                       Delegate Count Dukakis ....................................... . 465 Jackson ....................................... . 461 Gore ....................................... .... 355 Simon ....................................... ... 171 Gephardt ....................................... 145   Source: Associated Press</TEXT></DOC>
