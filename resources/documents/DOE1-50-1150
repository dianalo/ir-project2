The analysis shows that the highwaysystem can be classified into groups of route based on the level of risks,and that the spatial distribution of risk is highly correlated with populations.Hazardous material was found to be different from hazardous waste interms of hazard class, quantity of shipments, and the spatial patternof movement. The study used a model which sees community preparednessas a system of threat perception resources, social linkages, social climate,and planning. The data were collected through a survey of emergency-relatedpublic officials. The study suggest relevant policy for minimizing thenegative impacts of transporting of hazardous materials.</TEXT></DOC>
