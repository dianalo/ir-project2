BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Presbyterians should become more active inpolitics and should even consider civil disobedience to fight thespread of nuclear weapons, a proposed statement of doctrine for thenation's largest Presbyterian denomination says.   The paper, ``Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age,'' is expectedto be the main topic of discussion this week as the 3 million-memberPresbyterian Church (U.S.A.) starts a year-long bicentennialcelebration with its 200th General Assembly in St. Louis.   In addition to the peace paper, the 630 commissioners, ordelegates, will elect denominational officers and discuss a varietyof other social and church issues. The meeting opens Tuesday withinitial committee reports and an evening communion service, and runsthrough June 15.   ``Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age,'' written last year by atask force of 17 theologians, pastors and lay people, is an attemptto answer conservatives' criticism of an earlier study paper thattook a stronger stand in favor of disobedience, said the Rev. AlbertC. Winn, who co-chaired the task force.   ``This was our response to the charge that the first paper wasproducing warfare in the church and was going to divide thechurch,'' Winn said.   ``We were leaning over backwards to make clear that there is roomin the church'' for disagreement, he said.   The paper paints a picture of a world where children die ofhunger while money goes to build ``more devastating, more accurate,more invulnerable, `smarter' and `cleaner' weapons.''   Dissenters must think carefully before refusing to cooperate withgovernment authority in such things as paying taxes to support themilitary, the paper says. But ``because of the extraordinary andunprecedented nature of the current situation, cooperation with andobedience to duly constituted human authority should not be a matterof course.''   ``The decision to cooperate should be as agonizing and ascarefully undertaken as the decision to resist,'' the paper says. Itcalled on Presbyterians who opt not to resist authority to supportthose who do.   During the General Assembly, a committee will discuss the paperand report back to the full group. The committee's recommendationare tentatively scheduled to be presented June 14, the next-to-lastday of the meeting.   The paper also recommended that the church and its members take amore active role in politics and the ``public media,'' and thatparents refuse to purchase ``war toys'' for children.   Conservatives within the denomination had complained the earlierstudy paper, titled ``Presbyterians and Peacemaking: Are We NowCalled To Resistance?'' advocated tax resistance and civildisobedience to the exclusion of other methods of expression. Andsome say the second report is not much better.   ``The only real change (from the earlier paper) is tactical,''said the Rev. Paul F. Scotchmer, executive director of Presbyteriansfor Democracy and Religious Freedom, a conservative group. ``Insteadof calling outright for all Presbyterians to withhold `war taxes'and engage in other forms of resistance to the U.S. government ...the new document merely asks the entire church to throw its supportbehind those who do.''   The paper condemns the theory of nuclear deterrence _ that theexistence of nuclear weapons helps prevent war because each sideknows such a war would destroy it.   ``The moral case for nuclear deterrence, even as an interimethic, has been undermined by unrelenting arms escalation,'' thepaper says.   ``Having declared nuclear deterrence immoral, we must exerciseour individual corporate influence to effect a change in nationalpolicy as rapidly as possible.''   The denomination was formed in 1983 through a merger of theUnited Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and the Presbyterian Church(U.S.). The two bodies had split during the Civil War.   The church has headquarters in both Atlanta and New York, butwill move its general offices to Louisville, Ky., this summer.</TEXT></DOC>
