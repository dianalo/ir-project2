Meanwhile, British Trade Minister Alan Clark, and, his Soviet counterpart, Konstatin Katushev, said the countries had reached an agreement, valued at as much as #170 million pounds, to manufacture light commercial vehicles in the Soviet Union and to open a photocopy shop in Moscow.    As previously reported, the British bank credit line will be 85% backed by the government's export credits guarantee department. Other banks involved in the credit line include London-based Moscow Narodny Bank Ltd., Barclays Bank PLC, Lloyds Bank PLC, National Westminster Bank PLC, Bank of Scotland and Morgan Grenfell Group PLC.    Mr. Katushev said the British credit line as well as others recently established in West Germany and Italy will be used primarily to help modernize Soviet light industry. The French reportedly are expected to provide a similar credit line. </TEXT></DOC>
