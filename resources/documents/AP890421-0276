MARTINEZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Petroleum prices finished mixed Friday, cappinga frantic week in which a North Sea oil platform explosion sentcrude oil to the highest level in more than three years.   The explosion resulted in a supply shutdown that stopped theshipment of more than 500,000 barrels a day of Brent crude, orabout 30 percent of total North Sea Brent oil production, BritainEnergy Minister Cecil Parkinson said.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, finished4 cents higher at $21.32 a barrel. Contracts for delivery afterJune rose as much as 41 cents.   The $2.04 surge in the May contract on Thursday set a record forthe highest one-day rise since the exchange started trading crudeoil futures in March 1983, said John Santana, NYME statisticalanalyst. The contract closed at $24.65, the highest level sinceJan. 15, 1986, when it reached $25.15.   In the four days before the contract expired on Thursday thecontract rose more than $3, or about 16 percent.   Among refined products traded on the exchange Friday, unleadedgasoline for May delivery fell 0.41 cent to 74.16 cents a gallon,while the June contract was down 0.18 cent to 71.18 cents. Othercontract months finished higher.   May heating oil, meanwhile, rose 1.34 cent to 53.63 cents agallon, with other contract months also registering gains.   There was no word late Friday on when the Brent pipeline systemwould return to normal. Officials of Shell U.K., the unit of theRoyal Dutch-Shell Group that operates the platform and the pipelinesystem, indicated there might be a partial resumption of about100,000 barrels a day starting Monday.   British officials had indicated earlier in the week that theclosure could last up to four weeks.   Analysts said the timing of the North Sea accident on Tuesdaywas the biggest reason for rising prices, coming less than fourweeks after the Alaskan oil tanker spill that temporarily cut theflow of oil to refineries and adding to concerns about tightsupplies of gasoline for the summer.   ``We're heading into the driving season, only a month fromMemorial Day,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker with E.D.andamp; F. ManInternational Futures Inc. ``This is when refiners want to startincreasing production of gasoline. They want to make sure they haveenough crude to run their refineries at full capacity.''   Light North Sea Brent crude is in high demand because it is moreeasily refined into gasoline. Analysts said there is plenty ofcrude in storage to compensate for the shortfall if the North Seashutdown is not prolonged.   ``The stoppage in the North Sea could be serious and for a longtime, but there is enough OPEC and non-OPEC crude to make up thedifference in the short-term,'' said James Steel, energy analystwith Refco Inc.   Steel said the North Sea accident is not likely to boostconsumer prices, barring a prolonged shutdown.   ``Not because of this, but I think gasoline prices will go upfor other reasons,'' Steel said.   Those include the change to higher octane gasoline required bythe Environmental Protection Agency and the reduction in refinerycapacity. The same amount of crude oil makes a smaller amount ofgasoline. Also, demand for gasoline has risen dramatically over thelast year while the refinery capacity has declined as manyantiquated refineries closed down.   U.S. retail gasoline prices have risen more than 10 cents agallon since the Alaskan spill, based on a combination of factors,including expectations of possible short supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
