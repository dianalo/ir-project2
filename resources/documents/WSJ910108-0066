It was the fourthconsecutive year in which domestic motor vehicle sales posteda record.   An association spokesman said that the year's total,falling just short of six million units, was very high forJapan, but he added that motor-vehicle sales may be peaking.   Sales toward the end of last year fell back sharply fromlevels earlier in the year, which the spokesman said is amore realistic reflection of current market conditions. Theassociation said that for December total domestic auto salesfell 2% from the year-earlier month.   The association spokesman pointed out that potentialnegatives for 1991 sales include developments in the MiddleEast crisis and the state of the U.S. economy. Theassociation hasn't yet released a projection for 1991.                                                                                                          CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IN CUBA                                                                                                          A Cuban court has sentenced 41 people, including portofficials and customs officers, to fines and jail terms of upto 15 years for stealing clothes and other goods from eightship containers unloaded at Havana port. The Communist Partydaily Granma said the case was one of the biggest so far in acrackdown against crime, corruption and black marketing. Morethan 500 people have been arrested since the crackdown beganlast November.                                                                                                          BAD NEWS FOR CAMBODIA   Cambodia's rice production fell in 1990 because ofguerrilla conflict, floods and drought, the official mediareported. As a result, food shortages are expected in partsof the country. Preliminary figures show that production was1.7 million tons last year, the SPK news agency said. It saidproduction was 2.09 million tons in 1987 but didn't give morerecent figures.                                                                                                          MCDONALD'S ESPANA SUES                                                                                                          McDonald's Espana, the Spanish unit of the U.S. restaurantchain, is suing a Spanish consumer group that claimsfast-food hamburgers are unhealthy and sometimescontaminated, a company official said. As a result of thecharges, sales fell over the weekend at McDonald's, Wendy'sand Burger King, the three chains cited in the study releasedlast week by the Organization of Consumers and Customers,industry officials said. A McDonald's spokesman said thechain's products exceeded European Community standards anddismissed the consumer group's claims that hamburgersprepared in fast-food chains were &quot;unbalanced, bad andsometimes contaminated.&quot;                                                                                                          MEASURING JAPANESE CHILDREN                                                                                                          Japanese children are taller than they used to be. AnEducation Ministry survey shows the greatest height increasesamong 13-year-old boys, whose average height is now 5 feet2.5 inches -- 6.9 inches taller than in 1950. Eleven-year-oldgirls are now an average height of 4 feet 9.6 inches, up 5.7inches from 1950.                                                                                                          LIBERALIZATION IN PORTUGAL                                                                                                          The Bank of Portugal is removing credit limits oncommercial banks in the latest move toward liberalizing thePortuguese financial sector. Before 1990, the central bankfixed credit ceilings for individual banks based on a complexformula of assets and deposits. Last year, the bank imposed aglobal ruling, restricting credit increases to 2.5% of theprevious year's loans. After ceilings are removed, the banksaid, it will intervene on the short-term money market tocontrol liquidity. Observers said such intervention would beneeded to prevent excess money supply from pushing upPortuguese inflation, which was 14.1% in November.                                                                                                          BRITAIN'S WORSENING RETAIL SCENE                                                                                                          Britain's retail-sales slowdown in November was worse thaninitially estimated, according to figures released yesterday.   The Central Statistical Office reported that retail salesfell 0.8% in November from October and were down 1.1% from ayear earlier. The figures were revised downward fromprovisional estimates suggesting that sales had fallen 0.5%on the month and 0.8% on the year.   If anything, many economists had expected the provisionaldata to be revised upward, suggesting that the slowdownwasn't as sharp as initially thought. &quot;It shows howhorrifically weak things are,&quot; remarked Leo Doyle, aneconomist at Kleinwort Benson andamp; Co.   &quot;There is nothing in these numbers to suggest that therecession will be anything other than long and drawn out,&quot;added Neil Mackinnon, chief economist at YamaichiInternational Bank in London. He predicted that newprovisional sales data for December, due to be released Jan.14, would also show as much as a 0.5% decline despite theChristmas season. &quot;There's no sign of an early recovery,&quot; headded.
