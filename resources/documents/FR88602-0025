Background</ITAG>Today's Notice is in response to increased recent interest regarding infectiouswaste handling, treatment, and disposal. The purpose of this Notice isto make Agency information on the safe management of infectious wastesavailable to the public and to solicit public comment on a number of issuespertaining to infectious waste and the possible need for further governmentalaction. The Agency believes that the proper management of infectious wasteis crucial to ensure that any potential hazards to the public and to individualworkers are avoided.By way of background, on December 18, 1978, the Agency proposed regulationsunder the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-580 (Oct. 21, 1976)), which wouldclassify certain infectious wastes as hazardous waste. These wastes includedinfectious waste generated by certain departments in health care facilitiesand veterinary hospitals, by laboratories handling etiologic agents, andby sewage treatment facilities, unless these wastes were sterilized orincinerated in accordance with specified methods. (December 18, 1978, 43FR 58946, 58956.)The Agency proposed to list these wastes as hazardous because the Agencybelieved at that time that if they were improperly managed, they couldpose a substantial hazard to human health and the environment. It shouldalso be noted that the statutory definition of hazardous waste specificallycited infectiousness as one of the properties that the Agency should considerin its evaluation in defining wastes as hazardous; see section 1004(5),where it states ``the term hazardous waste means a solid waste, or combinationof solid wastes which because of its quality, concentration, or physical,chemical, or infectious characteristics, may . . .''. Significant commentswere received on the proposal; based upon these comments infectious wastewas not identified or listed as a hazardous waste when the regulationswere made final on May 19, 1980. See 45 FR 33087. Instead, the Agency initiatedseveral activities to collect information and assess the problems posedby infectious waste management and disposal. This information was thenused by the Agency to develop a draft guidance document in 1982 (on whichcomment was solicited) on infectious waste management. EPA then broughtin professionals from the health care industry to provide additional informationin preparing a final guidance document which was published in 1986. Thisdocument outlined a prescriptive program for the management of infectiouswaste. See ``EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Management'', described infurther detail in Part II, below. Additional guidance on the managementof infectious waste has also been provided. See ``Hospital Waste CombustionStudy'', also in Part II below, for a more detailed discussion.In addition to publishing guidance in May 1986, the Agency has taken anactive role in training health care professionals regarding the responsiblemanagement of infectious waste. Staff from the Agency have participatedas faculty or professional experts at symposia sponsored by the AmericanHospital Association and the American Society for Hospital Engineering.Furthermore, in November of 1987, as a result of several isolated incidentsof improper management and disposal of infectious wastes and growing publicconcern about the potential threat of infectious waste to human healthand the environment, the Agency called together a panel of experts to discussthe definition of, proper management, and risks posed by infectious wastes(see Part II for further discussion of this meeting).Today's notice of data availability and request for public comment is afurther effort to (1) make available to the public and those persons responsiblefor managing infectious waste the EPA guidance manual, and (2) solicitcomment on issues of concern regarding the proper management of infectiouswaste. The Agency believes that the proper management of infectious wastescan significantly reduce the risks associated with these wastes. The Agency,with this Notice, will reevaluate and assess the problems posed by infectiouswastes to determine if further Federal governmental action is necessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Availability of Data</ITAG>As already indicated, the agency has not promulgated regulations controllingthe management of infectious waste; instead, a number of guidance documentshave been prepared to assist the states and others interested in the managementof infectious waste. These documents are: (1) ``EPA Guide for InfectiousWaste Management'', U.S. EPA, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response,EPA/530-SW-86-014, May, 1986; and (2) ``Hospital Waste Combustion Study,Data Gathering Phase, Final Draft Report'', prepared by Radian Corporation,Research Triangle Park, NC for U.S. EPA, Office of Air Quality Planningand Standards, EPA Contract No. 68-02-4330, October, 1987. Each of thethese documents is included in the RCRA public docket, at the address listedabove. The following is a brief description of each document and includesfurther information on how the public can obtain copies:(1) The ``EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Management'' outlines the EPAperspective on environmentally acceptable techniques for managing infectiouswastes. Topics covered include a definition of infectious waste, the variouscategories of waste included under the definition, and recommended practicesfor packaging, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of thesewastes. In particular, the document discusses various types of treatmentalternatives and describes the suggested treatment methods for each wastecategory. The document is intended to provide guidance to persons responsiblefor infectious waste management. State and local regulatory agencies alsowill find this manual useful as resource material. Copies are availableas publication No. PB86.199130 from the National Technical InformationService (NTIS), Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia (703) 478-4650.This document is also available in the RCRA public docket. (2) The ``Hospital Waste Combustion Study'', October, 1987, summarizesreadily available information on the hospital waste combustion industryincluding waste characterization, industry technology, multipollutant airemissions data, emission control technologies, current regulation and controlstrategies, and hospital waste combustor population characteristics, includingsuggested model plant parameters for use in exposure modeling. The studywas initiated by EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards inresponse to increasing concerns over the potential public health impactsfrom the disposal of hospital wastes, including incineration and othermethods of disposal. This document is available in the RCRA public docket.In addition to the development of these documents, the Agency held a meetinglast November to discuss issues pertaining to infectious waste management.The primary purpose of this meeting was to discuss and evaluate the natureand extent of the risks to human health and the environment posed by wastesthat contain infectious materials. The meeting was held in response togrowing concerns about infectious waste management and to assist EPA indetermining whether the Agency should undertake any additional action underthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Infectious waste issues werediscussed by a group of experts representing health care professionalsand practitioners from government, academia, industry and professionaland trade associations called together by the EPA. The proceedings of thismeeting have been made available to the public. (See ``Report on the Proceedingsof the EPA Infectious Waste Management Meeting, November 12, 1987, EPAHeadquarters, Washington, D.C.'', available in the RCRA public docket).The Agency also has examined a recent survey, entitled, ``State InfectiousWaste Regulatory Programs'', assembled for the Council of State Governments,which summarizes the current status of state infectious waste regulations.This document is available from the Council of State Governments and acopy has been placed in the RCRA public docket for this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Issues Presented for Public Comment</ITAG>Several recent incidents involving infectious waste mismanagement haveresulted in a number of infectious waste issues being presented to theAgency. The Agency is offering today, for public comment, issues concerninginfectious waste. These issues are intended to solicit information whichwill help the Agency to better understand the problems posed by infectiouswaste, to identify additional sources of information, and to determinewhether further guidance or rules should be developed by EPA. Each of theseissues is presented below, introduced by a brief discussion and followedby specific questions for comment.A. Definition of Infectious WasteEPA currently defines infectious waste as waste capable of causing infectiousdisease. This definition requires the consideration of several factorscontributing to the risk of introduction of disease. As described in EPA'sguidance manual, these factors include: (1) Presence of a pathogen of sufficientvirulence; (2) dose of the pathogen; (3) portal of entry; and (4) resistanceof host. For a waste to be infectious, it must contain pathogens with sufficientvirulence and quantity so that exposure to the waste by a susceptible hostcould result in infectious disease. EPA has identified in the GuidanceDocument six infectious waste categories, including: (1) Isolation wastes;(2) cultures and stocks of infectious agents and associated biologicals;(3) human blood and blood products; (4) pathological wastes; (5) contaminatedsharps; and (6) contaminated animal carasses, body parts and bedding.The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health andHuman Services has also issued guidelines on infectious waste. Both EPAand CDC define infectious waste according to both waste characteristicsand waste type. The CDC guidelines differ only slightly from EPA's guidelinesin how they define infectious waste. In particular, both Agencies considermicrobiological waste, pathological waste, blood, and contaminated sharpsas infectious waste. EPA considers communicable disease isolation wastesas infectious, while CDC recommends such waste be treated according tohospital policy. EPA also has identified certain wastes such as surgeryand autopsy wastes, dialysis unit wastes, and contaminated equipment, whichthe Agency lists as optional infectious wastes, and thus may require specialhandling. CDC does not consider these optional wastes infectious. Also,CDC's guidelines only pertain to hospitals while EPA's guidance deals witha wider variety of sources.The state tend to classify infectious waste in one of three ways: (1) Asa hazardous waste; (2) as a special waste; or (3) as a solid waste. Thetrend is to classify infectious wastes as special or solid wastes. Currentstate regulations vary with respect to how they define infectious waste.Approximately two-thirds of the states have definitions in place or arecurrently adding to or amending their definitions of infectious waste.Of the 19 states that have definitions in place which are not undergoingamendment, approximately half include the four common EPA/CDC infectiouswastes in their definitions. While there exists a certain amount of variationamong the States' regulations, there appears to be some general agreementamong the states as to the basic definition of infectious waste.The Agency is requesting comment on the following issues concerning defininginfectious waste: Is EPA's current definition of infectious waste appropriate?If not, how should infectious waste be defined? Should this definitionbe based on waste characteristic, waste type, waste source, or a combinationof these factors? Are there different categories of infectious waste thatwarrant differing degrees of control?B. Nature of the Problem Posed by Infectious WasteInfectious wastes are generally disposed of through incineration, landfilling,or disposal in public sewers. Treatment of these wastes may or may notoccur prior to disposal in landfills or sewers. Such treatment if it occurs,is called pretreatment, and for infectious waste normally involves someform of sterilization of the waste, either through steam, chemical or othermethod or process of sterilization. The goal of pretreatment is to greatlyreduce, if not eliminate, any infectious characteristic. Approximately56 percent of the states require or are considering requiring pretreatmentbefore land disposal. At least twelve states currently allow, under certainconditions, land disposal of infectious waste without pretreatment.Current literature indicates that the risks posed by infectious waste areprimarily occupational, potentially affecting those people who encounterthese wastes from the point of generation to the point of disposal. Twooccupations that regularly encounter infectious waste are hospital employeesand waste disposal workers. The Agency, therefore, is interested in therisks posed to these two groups, as well as any risks posed to the generalpublic.The risks posed to these groups may be specific to certain wastes, suchas contaminated sharps (e.g., scalpels and hypodermic needles), or to certainmanagement practices. The Agency also is interested in how proper packagingof these wastes can curtail occupational risks posed to the groups mentionedabove. Proper packaging of these wastes reduces the potential for exposurewhich is a necessary factor for transmission of these diseases. This pointis recognized in that 15 states currently impose packaging/handling requirementson infectious waste generators, and 16 states are considering imposingsuch requirements.The Agency requests comment on the following issues: What are the risksand problems posed by exposure to infectious waste? To what extent is themismanagement of these wastes a problem? If fully implemented, are thecurrent pretreatment and packaging practices capable of reducing the risksposed by infectious waste or are additional requirements necessary? Shouldspecific disposal requirements be placed on specific wastes (i.e., sharps)?C. EPA's Role in Infectious Waste ManagementAs already discussed, EPA does not regulate infectious wastes as a hazardouswaste. Under RCRA, the Agency has the authority to regulate these wastesas hazardous. As discussed above, the Agency has chosen to issue guidelineson proper infectious waste management. In addition, infectious wastes aresubject to regulation as non-hazardous solid waste under Subtitle D ofthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).Many states have developed or are currently developing legislation andregulations to address infectious wastes. These state initiatives are relativelyrecent efforts, stimulated by the growing concern over infectious wastemanagement. There is considerable variation in the scope and level of stringencyamong the various state efforts. Currently 39 states have some form ofinfectious waste regulation. Five of the states without such regulationsplan on developing them soon. Currently, 88 percent of the states are,or will soon be, regulating infectious waste. This compares with 57 percentof the states that regulated infectious wastes in 1986.It has been suggested that one alternative to Federal regulation of infectiouswaste is the development of a model state program. A model state programis a comprehensive management program designed to provide guidance to stateswhich are developing similar programs. The model programs serve to makethe expertise of the Agency available to states and localities that mayneed assistance in developing comprehensive and effective programs. Suchmodels can provide useful information and guidance to those states developingprograms, but also provide state with the flexibility to tailor the modelto their individual state needs.The Agency is requesting comment on the following issues concerning EPA'srole in infectious waste management: What roles should EPA and/or the statesplay in the management of infectious waste? Should there be a Federal regulatorystructure for infectious waste management or should the Federal role beone of providing technical assistance and guidelines for state infectiouswaste programs? Should EPA's role be in the transfer of information oninfectious waste to states, localities, and the public? Is a model stateprogram for regulation of infectious wastes necessary or helpful? If so,are there particular areas on which such a program should concentrate?D. Tracking System for Infectious WasteSeveral instances of improper disposal of infectious waste have been documented.It has been suggested that a tracking system may alleviate the possibilityof such improper disposal. Tracking a waste can serve to improve the accountabilityof the parties involved in the management and disposal of that waste. Inthis way, tracking has the potential to improve compliance with managementand disposal regulations.Currently, infectious wastes are not subject to any Federal tracking requirements.If these wastes were simply classified as hazardous wastes by Federal regulations,they would be subject to the manifesting requirements of RCRA SubtitleC regulations. The manifest tracking requirement of Subtitle C relies onexception reporting for tracking of waste. Exception reporting requiresgenerators of regulated wastes who do not receive proper copies of themanifest from the disposal facility to report this noncompliance to a designatedauthority.Some tracking of infectious waste is currently being implemented at thestate level. A number of states have or are considering imposing transportationand recordkeeping requirements on infectious waste generators and haulers.In some states the types of shipping papers required are specified. Wheretracking is addressed in these state regulations, the tendency is to requirethe generator to maintain records on site, rather than submit manifeststo the State.The Agency requests comment on the following tracking issues: What typeof tracking system would be most appropriate for infectious wastes? Whichinfectious wastes should be tracked? Should exception reporting be required?E. Exemptions From an Infectious Waste Control ProgramAlthough much of the infectious waste that is generated comes from hospitalsand large laboratories, there are many small generators in the form ofprivate offices, clinics, and smaller labs which may become subject toregulation, if not otherwise exempted. Under current Subtitle C regulations,small quantity generators of hazardous waste are subject to certain conditionalexclusions. Presently, all but six states have or are considering regulationspertaining to infectious waste. The majority of states identify hospitalsas the target generator for regulation of infectious waste. Many of thestates that regulate hospitals also regulate clinics. Approximately halfof the states that regulate hospitals also regulate doctors and dentistsoffices, and animal care facilities. Five states currently exempt smallquantity generators from some or all infectious waste requirements.The Agency requests comments on the following issues concerning exemptionsfrom infectious waste controls: Should any generators of infectious wastebe exempted from management controls? Do small health care operations poseless risk because of the amount of waste they produce? If no generatorsare exempted, how many generators would be subject to infectious wastecontrols?The Agency specifically requests comments on all of the issues includedin today's notice. Comments on additional issues related to infectiouswaste will also be accepted. Once the Agency has reviewed all of the publiccomments, the Agency plans to evaluate the need for additional information,to collect and examine such information; and to ultimately develop an effectiveFederal program addressing infectious waste. Upon evaluating the commentssolicited in today's notice the Agency will also reevaluate the statusof the existing EPA guidance document on infectious waste.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261</ITAG>Hazardous materials, Waste treatment and disposal, Recycling.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 3001 RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.
