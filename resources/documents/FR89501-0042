Regulation is necessary to prevent spread of theMediterranean fruit fly (<T3>Ceratitis capitata </T3>(Wied.)), the melon fly (<T3>Dacus cucurbitae </T3>(Coq.)), and the Oriental fruit fly (<T3>Dacus dorsalis </T3>(Hendel)). These fruit flies, commonly referredto as ``Trifly,'' infest Hawaii but not the rest of the United States.On March 7, 1989, we published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 9453-9455, Docket No. 87-092) a proposalto amend the regulations to allow interstate movement pursuant to certificatesof untreated Sharwil avocados from Hawaii to any destination based on compliancewith certain harvesting and handling provisions.
