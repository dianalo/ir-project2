This revision provides an alternativereasonably available control technology (RACT) determination for controlof volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from twelve fabric coatingstations at Kenyon Industries, Incorporated (formerly Kenyon Piece Dyeworks)in Kenyon, Rhode Island. The revision involves an alternative RACT emissionlimit for the twelve fabric coating stations. Additionally, the revisionrequires the installation of add-on control equipment on the coating stationssubject to the alternative RACT limit. This has been determined to representRACT for Kenyon Industries (Kenyon) by EPA. The intended effect of thisaction is to approve this alternative RACT determination because Kenyonhas demonstrated that it is economically infeasible to control its VOCemissions to the level required in the Rhode Island's federally-approvedSIP for its source category.This action is being taken in accordance with section 110 of the CleanAir Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This action will become effective on April 11,1988, unless notice is received by March 11, 1988, that someone wishesto submit adverse or critical comments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Copies of the documents relevant to this action areavailable for public inspection during normal business hours at the JFKFederal Building, Room 2313, Boston, MA 02203; Public Information ReferenceUnit, EPA Library, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC. 20460; and the Airand Hazardous Materials Division, Department of Environmental Management,75 Davis Street, Cannon Building, Room 204, Providence, RI 02908.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>David B.

The version of the consent agreement proposedfor approval in the NPR was submitted as a revision to Rhode Island's SIPon November 5, 1985 and May 19, 1986. Rhode Island submitted additionalinformation regarding that consent agreement on February 21, 1986. On April15, 1987, the DEM formally submitted a revised version of the consent agreementto EPA for approval as the alternative RACT determination for Kenyon. Thisrevised consent agreement has been determined to be at least as stringentas the original version proposed for approval by EPA. This final rulemakingnotice (FRN) approves the revised version of the consent agreement andincorporates it by reference into the Rhode Island SIP.This consent agreement was issued pursuant to provisions found in RhodeIsland Regulation No. 19, subsection 19.3.3. Rhode Island Regulation No.19, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compounds from Surface Coating Operations,''was approved and incorporated in Rhode Island's SIP on July 6, 1983 (48FR 31026) as part of Rhode Island's Ozone Attainment Plan. This regulationapplies to facilities which emit more than 100 tons per year (TPY) of VOCemissions from either paper, fabric, or vinyl surface coating operations.A source subject to this regulation is required under subsection 19.3.1to apply reasonably available control technology (RACT) to its VOC emittingprocesses. The RACT limitations specified in subsection 19.3.1 are equivalentto those specified in EPA's applicable CTG document (EPA-450/2-77-008).The provisions of subsection 19.3.3 allow the DEM to impose alternativecompliance dates and emission limitations to those set forth in subsection19.3.1, on a case-by-case basis, provided that certain conditions are met.The process is commonly referred to as making an alternative RACT determination.In order to qualify for an alternative RACT determination under subsection19.3.3, a source must document at least 18 months prior to the final compliancedate set forth in subsection 19.3.1 that the applicable emission limitationscannot be met. This documentation involves demonstrating both economicallyand technologically that neither coating reformulation nor the installationof a control system is feasible or even partially feasible.EPA approved the provisions of subsection 19.3.3 for approval for alternativeRACT determinations on July 6, 1983 (48 FR 31026) as part of Rhode Island'sOzone Attainment Plan. It was EPA's intention when approving subsection19.3.3 that all alternative compliance dates and emission limitation relaxationsgranted pursuant to this subsection by the DEM would be submitted to EPAas SIP revisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of the Alternative RACT Determination</ITAG>Kenyon operates fifteen fabric coating stations: thirteen existing stationsand two new stations. At the time this SIP revision was first submitted,the VOC emissions from one of the existing stations were controlled withadd-on control equipment, the twelve other existing stations were uncontrolled,and the two new stations installed in 1981 were controlled to meet theLowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) requirements of Rhode Island's approvednew source review regulations.Kenyon coats fabrics which are used in a variety of products such as clothingand outdoor equipment. Due to the nature of the substrates coated, Kenyon'sexisting coating stations are subject to Rhode Island SIP Regulation No.19, subsection 19.3.1 which requires that the VOC content of each coatingemployed at Kenyon be at or below 2.9 pounds VOC/gallon of coating (minuswater) by July 1, 1985.Pursuant to the provisions of subsection 19.3.3 for alternative RACT determinations,the Rhode Island DEM has submitted a SIP revision which defines RACT forKenyon. The consent agreement requires Kenyon to maintain an emission limitationof 5.4 pounds VOC/gallon of coating (minus water) on its twelve uncontrolledfabric coating lines by June 30, 1985. As an additional RACT requirement,the consent agreement requires Kenyon to install add-on control equipmenton four of its fabric coating stations by December 31, 1986. These fourstations are required to meet the SIP limit of 2.9 pounds VOC/gallon ofcoating (minus water) on a solids-applied basis. EPA's review of extensive economic/financial information submitted by Kenyonhas indicated that it was economically infeasible for Kenyon to controlits VOC emissions by July 1, 1985 to the level set forth in subsection19.3.1 of Rhode Island's fabric coating regulation. Rather, EPA believesthat the emission limit of 5.4 pounds VOC/gallon of coating (minus water)for those twelve uncontrolled stations and the requirement for the applicationof add-on controls by December 31, 1986 on four of those twelve coatingstations subject to the 5.4 pounds VOC/gallon of coating (minus water)emission limitation as specified in the consent agreement constitute theapplication of RACT for Kenyon as expeditiously as possible. As further rationale for this action, it should be noted that Rhode Islandhas demonstrated that it has achieved sufficient VOC reductions necessaryto show attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)for ozone by December 31, 1982 in accordance with its approved plan. (However,the entire State of Rhode Island is still nonattainment due to transportof ozone from upwind sources into Rhode Island). Therefore, this variancefor Kenyon will not interfere with ``reasonable further progress'' (RFP)toward attainment of the ozone standard in Rhode Island as called for inthe approved plan. Additionally, Rhode Island has determined there is anadequate margin for growth, below the level of emissions necessary to showattainment of the NAAQS for ozone, to absorb the increased emissions resultingfrom this alternative RACT. Each year Rhode Island recalculates that growthmargin based on updated emission figures for all existing sources and emissionsfrom new sources. Rhode Island only allows increases in VOC emissions fromits sources based on the availability of emissions in that growth margin.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Provisions of the Consent Agreement </ITAG>The revised consent agreement also contains a schedule which requires Kenyonto install add-on controls on the remaining eight coating stations whichare subject to the emission rate of 5.4 pounds VOC/gallon of coating (minuswater). The schedule is more stringent than the schedule for the installationof add-on controls contained in the original version of the consent agreementproposed for approval and described in the NPR. As such, implementationof the revised consent agreement will result in more rapid reduction ofVOC emissions. This schedule is based on an updated analysis conductedby the DEM of Kenyon's financial records which determined when Kenyon willhave the funds available to make the necessary capital expenditures topurchase and install add-on control equipment. The DEM has renegotiated the schedule to install add-on control equipmentwith Kenyon pursuant to the provisions of subsection 19.3.3(a)(2)c whichrequire any facility that has been granted an alternative RACT to undergoanother RACT review every two years until the final emission limitationof Regulation No. 19 is achieved. The revised consent agreement requires Kenyon to install add-on controlequipment on the eight remaining coating stations which are limited toVOC emissions of 5.4 pounds VOC/gallon of coating (minus water) in twophases. First, Kenyon is required to install add-on controls on four uncontrolledstations (Line KK-4) by December 31, 1987. Secondly, Kenyon is requiredto install add-on control equipment on the remaining four uncontrolledstations (two on Line KK-1, one on Line KK-2, and one on Line KK-3) byJuly 1, 1988. After July 1, 1988, all lines will be controlled to the regulatoryemission limitation of 2.9 pounds VOC/gallon of coating (minus water) andthe alternative RACT will no longer apply. Another difference between the revised consent agreement and the originalconsent agreement proposed for EPA approval is that the order in whichLine KK-5 and Line KK-4 must be controlled has been switched. EPA has determinedthat the control of Line KK-5 first, as required by the revised consentagreement, will result in lower VOC emissions more rapidly than if LineKK-4 has been controlled first, as proposed in the original consent agreement.Because uncontrolled emissions from Line KK-5 are greater than uncontrolledemissions from Line KK-4, control of Line KK-5 to the regulatory emissionlimit will achieve actual reductions more rapidly. EPA has determined that, in all cases, and at all times, the requirementsof the new consent agreement are at least as stringent as the old consentagreement which EPA proposed to approve as alternative RACT determinationfor Kenyon. In addition, it should be emphasized that these additionalprovisions are beyond what EPA has determined RACT is for Kenyon. RACTrequirements for Kenyon were met on December 31, 1986. The State of RhodeIsland has requested that EPA approve these additional provisions of theconsent agreement in order to make them federally enforceable. EPA is approving these provisions. The State of Rhode Island and Kenyonhave agreed that these requirements can be met by the dates specified.Therefore, EPA believes that they reflect the application of RACT as expeditiouslyas practicable. No public comments were received on the NPR. A notice of proposed rulemaking has already been published on this revision.However, because the consent agreement being approved by this final rulemakingwas revised since that notice of proposed rulemaking, we are allowing theopportunity for public comment. The version of the consent agreement weare approving today is more stringent than the proposed version. If noticeis received within thirty days that adverse or critical comments will besubmitted on the differences between the original consent agreement andthe revised consent agreement, I will withdraw this action and publishanother Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action </ITAG>EPA is approving the administrative consent agreement for Kenyon Industriesin Kenyon, Rhode Island submitted as a SIP revision by the DEM on April15, 1987 and an addendum to that submittal dated May 14, 1987. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Under section 307(b) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by April 11, 1988. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements.
