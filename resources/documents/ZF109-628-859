 The first concernswho will control the future development of the PostScript language.andP;  Asreaders know, we believe that when it comes to software standards of anysort, there are considerable commercial advantages to being in the driver'sseat.andP;  Ever since Microsoft and Apple announced their font and PDL alliancelast year, it has been clear that a showdown with Adobe was in the offing.andM;The second issue is how to divided the processing load between theworkstation and the printer.andP;  At one extreme is the old MacintoshPlus/LaserWriter combination: the printer's controller was a smarter computerthan the Mac, and nearly all of the processing involved in printing aPostScript page was handled in the printer.andP;  The argument in favor of thisapproach is that the workstation can send the page out and get on with otherwork.andP;  At the other extreme, Sun and Microsoft favor putting all theprocessing in the workstation and driving a dumb (controllerless) printer.andO;The argument here is that the workstation has computing power to spare, so itmakes sense to save money by doing the rasterizing in the workstation anddriving the cheapest possible print engine.andM;This, it seems to us, is a tactical question rather than a strategic one.andO;The advantage clearly used to be with smart printer controllers because theworkstations of three years ago didn't have much surplus power.andP;  Now, with'040, '486 and Sparc chips, workstations can get a fair amount of backgroundprocessing done without noticeably slowing the foregound application.andP;  Sothere is a solid rationale for dumb printers.andM;We think the pendulum will swing again: embedded controllers will becomecheap and incredibly fast (due to hardware font rasterizer chips and thelike), while applications will be written that need every bit of speed theworkstation can deliver.andP;  (Think of voice- and video-annotated documents,photorealistic ray-traced graphics and other goodies.)andP;  So don't be convertedto one doctrine or the other; it's just an economic decision.andM;The Future of PostScriptandM;Everybody agrees that PostScript is here to stay.andP;  Most observers also agreethat the language is currently far from perfect and that it will have toevolve to meet the needs of the digital world.andP;  The key players in directingthat evolution will clearly include Adobe and Microsoft, though there may beothers.andP;  And, as we shall see, Adobe and Microsoft have very different ideasof the directions in which they want to go.andM;Adobe's directionandM;Level 2.andP;  Adobe announced Level 2 PostScript at its first annual developers'conference last May (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  10).andP;  Level 2 includes some newfeatures: data compression, better color halftoning, device-independent colorspaces, caching of partially rasterized objects on disk, and support fordevice-specific printer operations, and among other things.andP;  It also pullstogether language extensions that had been developed for various specialapplications: Display PostScript, ATM and the composite font technology fornon-Roman languages.andM;Adobe generally leaves product announcements to its OEM customers, but it hassaid that it is developing Level 2 controllers for a number of printermanufacturers and that announcements can be expected in the first half of1991.andM;This does not mean that Level 1 printers will no longer be made.andP;  Adobeexpects that there will be new Level 1 printers announced in 1991 and perhapsbeyond.andP;  Level 2 functions require more ROM and RAM in the controller (andpresumably need a relatively fast CPU for decent performance) and so willonly appear in higher-priced printers at first.andP;  Level 1 will still be thenorm for printers aimed at a budget-conscious audience.andP;  In time, as theprice of computing power continues to fall, Level 2 will take over more andmore market niches.andM;Besides the well-known Atlas controller (based on a 68020 processor), Adobehas developed several other controller designs to fit a range ofprice/performance tradeoffs.andM;* Midget and Scout, both based on the Motorola 68000 CPU.andP;  These are designedto go into an under-$1,000 PostScript printer.andM;* Garnet, based on the Weitek 8200 chip.andM;* Ruby, based on the Intel 960KA (integer math) and 960KB (on-chipfloating-point unit) RISC processors.andM;* Amethyst, based on AMD's 29000 RISC chips.andM;* Emerald, which uses the MIPS R3000 CPU and R3010 math chip (see Vol.andP;  4,No.andP;  9).andM;Agfa, Autologic, Monotype, Scangraphic and Varityper have already shownhigh-resolution imagesetters that use the Emerald controller.andP;  However,several of these vendors have held back shipments until Adobe releases thenew color screening algorithms, expected before the year's end.andP;  OtherRISC-based controllers are expected to be announced over the coming sixmonths.andM;PostScript fax.andP;  Although Group III fax specifiesa 200-dpi resolution, if youprint a page and fax it, the result will look distinctly worse than a 200-dpiprinted page.andP;  The problem is that the facsimile scanning process introducesits own artifacts; the scanner rarely takes its samples in the same placesthat the printer put its dots, and you wind up with scanner jaggies added tothe printer jaggies.andM;One solution, in Adobe's view, it to have the PostScript rasterizer workdirectly at 200 dpi and rather than print the result on paper, pass the bitsto a 9600-bps fax modem.andP;  That way, there is only one set of jaggies tocontend with, and the font hints can be used to minimize them.andP;  Thiscapability is being built into all of the new Next workstations.andM;Even better, if the receiving fax device is also a PostScript printer, youcould simply send the PostScript data at 9600 bps and have the pagerasterized at the other end.andP;  For most documents, the PostScript data is muchmore compact than the raster data that a fax scanner would generate, so thepage would take much less time to send.andP;  Adobe has said to expect anannouncement about this in the first quarter of 1991.andM;A fax receiver (PostScript-equipped or not) must be available 24 hours a day.andO;But an office PostScript printer is often tied up printing jobs sent by thelocal computers.andP;  We imagine, therefore, that the ideal PostScript faxreceiver would include a small hard disk and print-spooling software.andP;  Itwould also have a connection to the office printers (by LocalTalk or aparallel or serial port) so local users could gain the benefits of printerspooling.andP;  In a Unix environment, the spooler might be a task running insomeone's workstation rather than a dedicated piece of hardware.andM;Hardware accelerators.andP;  Last year, Adobe acquired Bluepoint, which haddeveloped a font-rasterizing chip.andP;  It has since been working to adapt theBluepoint technology to hinted Type 1 fonts.andP;  Again, no dates were discussed,but Adobe has said that we can expect rasterizing chips running at1,000-3,000 characters per second to start to appear in high-speed printersand in Kanji printers.andM;Adobe also mentioned that halftone screening is a natural candidate forhardware acceleration.andP;  Linotype already sells its own halftoningacceleration in its RIP 4 and Neptune controllers, and we imagine that otherhigh-end vendors have thought deeply about ways to add such a feature.andM;Truelmage extensions for several GUIsandM;Back in the Dark Ages of computer printing (till about five years ago), eachapplication program used its own specialized imaging model.andP;  There was nochoice, really; microcomputer display hardware varied widely from brand tobrand, and computers were so slow that the program had to optimize its use ofthe display by providing a separate screen driver for each kind of hardware.andO;The same thing was true of printers: they were all different, so the programhad to provide a separate printer driver for each one.andM;The advent of graphical uaser interfaces (GUIs) built into the operatingsystem meant that all applications could, and should, use the system'simaging model.andP;  It now made sense that the operating system, rather than theapplication, should provide one driver for each screen and printer to besupported.andP;  This is the model that the Macintosh, Gem, Windows andPresentation Manager graphic environments follow today in greater or lesserdegrees.andM;In Microsoft's view, if you expect to be operating and printing in a singlegraphic environment, the most sensible solution is to buy a GUI-specificprinter, one that closely follows the imaging model used on the screen.andP;  Themost economical technique, in the era of '386 and '486 processors on everydesktop, is to handle rasterization in the CPU, sending the resulting bitmapto a very dumb (controllerless) and hence very cheap printer.andP;  You can saveeven more money by dispensing with the printer's front-panel display; thecomputer can put up a screen window to show printer status.andM;On the other hand, if you need your printer to work in multiple graphicenvironments--serving, heterogeneous platforms across networks, forexample--then it makes sense to have a separate, generalized printer imagingmodel such as PostScript.andP;  A relatively simple device driver in each computertranslates the internal imaging model to the printer's imaging model.andO;However, as users of current PostScript printers have found, printing thesame document from different computers can cause irritating differences inthe resulting output, particularly when it comes to color printing.andO;Microsoft's proposed alternative is to develop GUI-specific extensions toTrueImage so that the printer imaging model will be as close to eachcomputer's internal model as possible.andM;In other words, we can expect Microsoft to develop complete software RIPs fordumb ink-jet and laser printers, aimed at the low-cost personal-printermarket.andP;  These RIPs will be developed specifically for Windows and forPresentation Manager.andP;  For the shared-printer market, new drawing commandsthat match the screen drawing commands of the Windows GDI and thePresentation Manager GPI will be added to TrueImage.andP;  Microsoft is not in agreat hurry to implement the features that Adobe will be putting into Level 2PostScript.andM;In proposing to offer software RIPs that execute in the PC, Microsoft isdoing exactly what Sun has done in NewsPrint.andP;  Not everyone thinks this is agood idea.andP;  For one thing, a Sparcstation is a bit more powerful than a PC,and Unix handles background tasks more gracefully than does Windows.andP;  A lotof the computers running Windows have only '286 processors and 1-2 MB ofmemory; asking such a machine to serve as a RIP means waiting a long time foryour print job.andP;  In addition, printer controllers aren't all that expensivenow.andP;  Does it really make sense to slow down a $5,000 PC for a task that a$250 embedded controller could do?andM;PostScript clones: the loyal oppositionandM;Bob Downs, of Phoenix Technologies, pointed out that the vendors ofPostScript clones have an important role in the market: that of the &quot;loyalopposition.&quot;andP;  Adobe's competitors, he said, fulfill several importantfunctions:andM;* They address Adobe's unserved markets--system integrators needing thelicense and modify source code, vendors that are too small to make Adobe'sshort list of strategic partners, extremely price-sensitive market segmentsand so on.andM;* They introduce complementary innovations to the market--PostScriptinterpreter cartridges, companion emulations such as PCL 5, novel halftonescreening approaches, multiple font renderers (for example, supporting Speedoor Nimbus Q fonts as well as Type 1 and Type 3).andM;* They press for the evolution of a single open language standard, and forthe resolution of incompatibilities between font systems and between colormatching schemes.andM;In other words, according to Downs, clone-makers are not vultures stealingpieces of the lion's kill; they are more like the pilot fish that swim withthe shark, sharing its meals but also providing valuable service in keepingthe shark healthy.andM;One user's wish listandM;R.R.andP;  Donnelley is the largest printing firm in the U.S.andP;  and probably thelargest PostScript user as well.andP;  Harold Evans, a Seybold Seminars regular,described Donnelley's hopes for future PostScript developments.andP;  In his view,PostScript has been of incalculable benefit to both users and vendors.andP;  Theusers have gotten the benefits of competition among vendors, such as lowerprices and more price/performance points to choose from.andP;  By making desktoppublishing possible, PostScript has allowed users to shorten their productionschedules and to exert more control over the production process.andP;  The vendorshave benefited too: new product categories have been created and new marketshave opened u.andP;  So, says Evans, let's stick with Adobe, which is the devil weknow.andM;Evans would like a truly editable PostScript, one that would allow movingformatted pages across multiple platforms while retaining the ability to editthe pages all along the way.andP;  This capability would also require standardnaming conventions for fonts, allowing accurate substitutions to be made, andnew font licensing practices, allowing fonts to be sent along with thedocuments that use them.andM;He also wants better support for moving PostScript files into color prepresssystems.andP;  The color system vendors' current approach, rasterizing thePostScript file so that it can be imported as if it were a scanned image,amounts to intentionally inflicting damage on a perfected good vector datastructure.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
