An importantaspect for the efficient utilization of converter gas was the developmentor the establishment of a high degree of flexibility in terms of interchangeabilityof the individual fuel gases. The paper also discusses the characteristicparameters of the gas, the frequency distribution of calorific values,the combustion properties as well as the prerequisites for a fully interchangeablefuel gas. At present, the converter gases featuring different compositionsare used directly or as mixed gas for the firing from below of coke ovens,for the heating of ignition furnaces in sintering plants, for hot-blaststove heating, for the heating of pit furnaces, pusher-type furnaces,walking-beam furnaces and heat-treatment furnaces, for ladle heatingplants and mixer firming plants, for the heating of a lime shaft kiln,in power stations and steam boilers for the generation of electricalenergy and production steam, as well as for the generation of long-distanceheat. The effects of converter gas utilization at the users are illustratedby several examples.</TEXT></DOC>
