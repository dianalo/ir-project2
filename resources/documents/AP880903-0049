But Chief U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins, citing mandatorysentencing guidelines, said Friday he had no choice but to setprison terms of 15 years for clan ringleader Addam Swapp and fiveyears for Swapp's mother-in-law Vickie Singer.   Swapp's brother, Jonathan Swapp, and Mrs. Singer's son, JohnTimothy Singer, both 21, each received mandatory 10-year sentencesfor a pair of firearms charges and five years probation on twoother counts.   ``I've heard stronger sentencing comments (from a judge) in adrunk driving case,'' said a livid U.S. Attorney Brent Ward, whosaid he probably would appeal the sentences.   ``Frankly, I was surprised,'' said Addam Swapp's attorney, JohnBucher.   ``It was interesting, but it doesn't matter,'' Swapp said Fridaynight. ``I've got little children who will be married in 15 years.It might as well have been the death penalty to me.''   Prosecutors said Swapp, 27, could have been imprisoned for 75years and Mrs. Singer for 50 for their roles in the Jan. 16 bombingof a Mormon chapel in Marion and a 13-day siege of their farm by100 federal and state officers.   ``I think once again that everyone involved in this wholeprocess continues to wonder why it ever occurred,'' Jenkins toldMrs. Singer, 45, who tearfully begged him to free her.   Jenkins said federal mandatory sentencing laws imposed byCongress ``illustrate a crisis of the whole sentencing process.''   As the defendants appeared before Jenkins in separate hearings,the judge repeatedly stressed that their sentences were not thedecision of the court, but the will of Congress, ``which knowsnothing about this case.''   The criticism of Congress infuriated Ward, who rose to defendthe statutes at the end of the day, then called a news conference.   He said the sentences would be appealed on ground that Jenkinsdeclined to impose penalties on some counts and handed out whatprosecutors believe were less-than-minimum terms on others.   ``There's no case I know of that more clearly shows the wisdomof Congress in imposing minimum sentences,'' Ward said.   If an appeal is filed, it could take as long as a year toresolve the issue, he said.   Such an action would not affect plans to file state murdercharges in the shooting death of state Corrections Lt. Fred House,who was killed in the shootout that ended the siege Jan. 28, saidWard.   The family contended the bombing was ordered by God as a sign ofthe impending collapse of the Mormon Church and all government, andthat it would trigger the return of patriarch John Singer, who wasslain by police nine years before for resisting arrest.   A jury convicted the four clan members in May of 20 of 23 counts.   Jenkins sentenced Swapp to consecutive, mandatory five-yearsentences for two firearms counts and for maliciously damaging thechurch with a bomb. He stayed, pending successful completion of afive-year probation, sentencing for attempted murder of federalagents, forcibly resisting and assaulting agents and bombpossession.   He declined to sentence Swapp on a use-of-a-bomb count, sayingit duplicated the malicious damage count.   Mrs. Singer's mandatory five-year term was for use of a firearm.Jenkins declined to sentence her for bomb use. He stayed afour-year sentence for malicious damage and a pair of two-yearsentences for forcible assault-resistance and bomb possession.Violation of her five-year probation would force imposition of thestayed sentences, a government attorney said.   In addition to their mandatory 10-year terms on the firearmscounts, Jonathan Swapp and John Timothy Singer both received stayedsentences for attempted murder and assaulting and resisting agentspending successful completion of five years probation.</TEXT></DOC>
