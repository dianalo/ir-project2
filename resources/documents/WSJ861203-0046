The sale of 57.5% of its Information Systems group, which was expected, includes an option that calls for a $250 million discount of the assets being transferred into the new multinational concern. Terms of the transaction also would allow Honeywell to sell an additional 22.6% stake by 1988, thus reducing its interest to 19.9%. Analysts were surprised at the discounted price, which seemed to indicate Honeywell's eagerness to substantially reduce its exposure in what has been a frustrating and costly business.    A resulting $250 million asset write-down, plus other restructuring costs, will lead to what is believed to be the first annual loss for the Minneapolis-based electronics concern. Some analysts estimated that the loss could exceed $200 million.    Honeywell will sell most of its Information Systems computer group to a yet-unnamed new company. Both Honeywell and Compagnie des Machines Bull of France would take 42.5% stakes in the venture, with Bull having the option to increase its stake. NEC Corp. of Japan would own 15% of the concern.    The move will allow Honeywell to concentrate on two businesses in which it has dominant positions -- controls, and aerospace and defense.    Both Bull and NEC indicated yesterday that while the new company would give them inexpensive entree to the U.S market, they also had little choice but to join the venture to protect their investments with Honeywell, a longtime partner in computers.    &quot;For a large part of our sales, we depended on the continuation of cooperation with Honeywell, which was under a cloud of uncertainty,&quot; said Francis Lorentz, Bull's managing director.    An NEC spokesman said the Tokyo-based electronics giant &quot;never wanted more than a minor participation&quot; but saw the venture as a way to &quot;create a company that will be far stronger.&quot;    All three concerns already market each other's products, and both Honeywell and Bull rely on NEC for mainframe technology. Bull is the largest of the three in networking capabilities that allow diverse computer models to interact -- an increasingly important business world-wide.    Under terms of the tentative agreement, Bull would pay $120 million to $130 million, and NEC between $40 million and $50 million, for their stakes. A definitive accord must be reached by March 31.    Honeywell would transfer to the new concern about 22,500 employees, or 24% of its world-wide work force, along with all of its manufacturing plants and support facilities. But it would retain its Federal Systems computer business, which last year had revenue of about $250 million. A Honeywell-NEC venture to sell supercomputers in North America also wasn't included in the new company.    Honeywell personnel would continue to operate the business. Honeywell said that neither foreign partner would bring in their managers, although some analysts yesterday expressed doubts that such an arrangement would hold long term. A board headed by Bull would oversee the venture, which would be based in Minneapolis.    The transfer initially would give Honeywell at least $500 million. That would come from payments by the two partners and by recouping $350 million in loans and investments in its computer business. In addition, Honeywell could receive as much as $60 million more under its option to reduce its ownership.    Most analysts applauded the venture, which was inspired by Honeywell, and noted that by remaining a minority player the company has access to technology it needs in the factory-automation and integrated office-systems markets it is emphasizing. But some questioned the low price it agreed to.    &quot;I thought they should get more, a lot more,&quot; said George Podrasky of Duff andamp; Phelps, Chicago. But Gary Blauer, who follows Honeywell for Dain, Bosworth in Minneapolis, said, &quot;It's a company that's struggling, so it's getting a struggling price.&quot;    Honeywell shares closed at $70.125, down $1.375, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.    How the new company will be structured and make decisions &quot;opens a can of worms,&quot; said Rudolf Strobl, a computer analyst with Arthur D. Little andamp; Co. &quot;On the other hand, Honeywell is sending a very clear signal to the marketplace and its customers on what they're going to do. This reduces a lot of ambiguity.&quot;    Once completed, the accord must be approved by Bull shareholders -- the company is now state owned but scheduled to become publicly held -- and by the U.S. Justice Department, which would consider antitrust implications. </TEXT></DOC>
