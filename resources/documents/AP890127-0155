President Bush's nomination of the Washington attorney and formerhousing and urban development secretary now goes to the full Senatefor a vote on confirmation. No date has been set.   Mrs. Hills would succeed Clayton K. Yeutter, who has been tappedby Bush for secretary of agriculture, in the job of top U.S. tradenegotiator.   Before the committee, Mrs. Hills sought to dampen concern thatshe could become vulnerable to conflict-of-interest charges becauseshe and her attorney husband, Roderick Hills, have representedforeign law clients.   ``Let me address the question of potential conflicts of interestright away,'' she said. ``There are none.''   She promised that she and her husband would divest themselves ofany business interests that could present such a conflict and thatshe would keep hands off any cases involving her former clients.Senators seemed satisfied.   ``I think you're going to make a terrific trade representative,''Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., said.   A witness who appeared briefly before the panel, however, AnthonyHarrigan, president of the U.S. Business and Industrial Council,argued that her involvement with foreign clients made it impossiblefor Mrs. Hills to avoid a conflict. Several lawmakers took issuewith him.   Mrs. Hills told the committee that she would prefer to openforeign markets with negotiations and a handshake. But she addedthat she would seek to do so ``with a crowbar if necessary.''   ``Retaliation cannot be the goal of our policy,'' she said. ``Infact, it signals the failure to open foreign markets. But thecredible threat of retaliation provides essential leverage in ourmarket-opening efforts. Thus, actual retaliation will be used,albeit reluctantly, to preserve the credibility of this threat.''   Bush's choice of Mrs. Hills initially brought a statement fromFinance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, that he had hopedfor someone with experience in international markets for the post.   Bentsen had a more enthusiastic response when she appeared Fridaybefore his committee.   ``You have done well and you have answered with more specificsthan I have normally heard from a person being confirmed,'' Bentsensaid. ``They usually fudge their answers more.''   She discussed complex trade issues ranging from plywood exportsto European government subsidies for the Airbus Industrie jetlinermanufacturer.   Supporters of Mrs. Hills have been assuring lawmakers that shehas the toughness to represent America in difficult trade battles.   ``Make no mistake,'' said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., ``this is agentle lady, but this lady has the guts of a lion.''   Her tough-minded style found encouragement among panel members,with Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., saying he found ``a touch ofnaivete'' in Bush's vow to work for ``a kinder and gentler'' America.   ``The world is not necessarily kinder and more gentle when itcomes to international trade,'' Baucus said. ``There's a state ofnear economic war.''</TEXT></DOC>
