It is found that the flexuralrigidity generally increased over time, from less than 10{sup 29} dyne-cmearly in the basin's history, to more than 10{sup 30} dyne-cm late inthe basin's development. They attribute this increase in rigidity tocooling and thickening of the elastic portion of the lithosphere as thebasin was subsiding. Low flexural rigidity early in the basin's historyindicates that the lithosphere was probably rejuvenated prior to basinsubsidence. The rejuvenation process is investigated using a finite-differencethermal model in which a 142-km plate is temporarily heated from below.Taking the depth to the 450{sup 0}C isotherm to be the effective elasticthickness of the lithosphere, rigidity predicted by the thermal modelis consistent with the observed increase in rigidity over time. Theyconclude that the lithosphere in this area was rejuvenated approximately500 million years ago. As the lithosphere cooled, it thickened; it alsocontracted and subsided. Observed rapid subsidence between about 500and 450 million years ago cannot be explained by thermal contraction;in fact, it occurs when the thermal model predicts heating and uplift.This subsidence episode may have been the result of densification processesaccompanying rejuvenation.</TEXT></DOC>
