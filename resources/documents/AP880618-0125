(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two hundred years ago Tuesday, the federalConstitution became the supreme law of the United States when,after months of bickering, New Hampshire cast the ninth anddeciding vote to ratify.   The decision ``laid the top stone to the grand FEDERAL EDIFICE,and happily raised the NINTH pillar,'' rejoiced the New HampshireGazette, based in the Federalist stronghold of Portsmouth. The 13states had decided at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphiathat nine votes were needed to ratify.   At a party the following week, nine candles were lit in eachwindow of the Portsmouth Statehouse and a band played.   ``Language is too poor to describe the universal joy that glowedin every countenance,'' the Gazette reported.   But, if the wealthy traders and military elite of the seacoastcelebrated the establishment of a stronger national government, theless-educated anti-Federalists in the central parts of the stategrudgingly accepted their defeat in the 57-47 ratification vote.   ``It is adopted,'' said Joshua Atherton of Exeter, key spokesmanof the anti-Federalists, who initially commanded a majority. ``Letus try it.''   The vote capped a bitter debate between Federalists, who arguedthat a strong government was needed to provide stability and pullthe country out of a recession, and their opponents, who believedthe Constitution laid the groundwork for the kind of tyrannicalcentral government they fought in the Revolution.   In February 1788, New Hampshire had held a constitutionalconvention in which Atherton had the votes needed to reject thedocument. Had Federalists not scrambled to adjourn the Exetermeeting, New Hampshire might have earned the distinction of beingthe first state to reject the Constitution.   ``With Rhode Island's rejection following, two in a row, it justcould have blunted the whole process,'' said Dartmouth historianJere Daniell.   Atherton, a Harvard-educated lawyer who had been a Britishloyalist in the early years of the war, argued that theConstitution threatened the state power and personal liberties. Healso argued fervently against a federal judiciary.   When he rose to speak, he whipped a cape around him, struckdramatic postures and ``naturally made himself obnoxious tosupporters of the Constitution,'' wrote Charles Bell in ``The Benchand Bar of New Hampshire.''   John Quincy Adams, who came up from Massachusetts for thedebates, found Atherton ``a miserable speaker and a worsereasoner.''   Others found Atherton more compelling, including abolitionistswho later credited him with strong opposition to the section of theConstitution that allowed slavery.   Religion was another potent issue. Some in New Hampshire thoughtfederal law should mirror their state's requirement _ until 1877 _that officeholders provide proof of Protestant affiliation.   The proposed two- and six-year federal legislative terms alsofrightened anti-Federalists who saw the state's one-year terms asmore reasonable.   Thirty-eight delegates arrived at the convention with bindingorders from their towns to reject the Constitution.   But such Federalists as John Langdon, an international traderwho represented the state at the Constitutional Convention; JohnSullivan, a former general and president of New Hampshire, andSamuel Livermore, a Superior Court chief justice, had strongpersonal and political skills.   Newspapers were inundated with Federalist articles, emphasizingthe inefficiency of interstate trade, devastating unemployment andthe inability to defend frontier areas under the Articles ofConfederation.   Several capitalized on Atherton's Tory past, accusing him of``wishing to prevent the adoption of a system only because it willput it out of the power of Britain to subjugate us.''   Federalist politicking was aided by the momentum of eight states_ Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut,Massachusetts, Maryland and South Carolina _ standing behind thedocument.   ``Eight States have already adopted it, and should we but makethe ninth, would it not be much to our credit?'' asked a letter inthe Gazette.   The race to cast the decisive vote was with Virginia, which alsowas meeting in June, in Richmond.   When delegates gathered in Concord's Old North Meeting House onJune 18, 1788, Federalist leaders knew they had the numbers to win.They wanted a speedy vote, but Atherton stalled, arguing that onlywith a 12-item addendum of rights should the Constitution pass.   To ratify it without requiring a bill of rights, he said, was``to surrender our all, and then ask our new Masters if they willbe so gracious as to return to us some, or any part of, our mostimportant rights and privileges.''   The ploy failed, and the convention moved for a vote onaccepting the Constitution unconditionally _ though with arecommendation of future passage of the Bill of Rights.   The final vote on June 21 approved the Constitution by a marginof 10, surprising even the most optimistic pro-Constitutionstrategists.   Convention Secretary John Calfe recorded the time, 1 p.m., incase Virginia disputed it, and a letter was dispatched to Richmond.   Five days later, before the letter arrived, Virginia became the10th state to approve the Constitution. New York followed in July.North Carolina and Rhode Island, recognizing they already wereruled by a document they hadn't approved, ratified in 1789 and 1790.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tues AMs, June 21</NOTE></DOC>
