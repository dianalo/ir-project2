<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-64-0794 </DOCNO><TEXT>A multi-dimensional investigation of the scavenging process in the GM6V53TGeneral Motors diesel engine has been carried out. This six cylindertwo-stroke engine features uniflow scavenging with four exhaust valvesper cylinder, direct fuel injections and turbochanging. The conservationequations of mass, energy, concentration, turbulence kinetic energy andenergy dissipation rate have been written in finite difference form andsolved explicitly in time. The scavenging process has been studied byusing a configuration of two exhaust valves as compared with the actualconfiguration which has four exhaust valves. The computed flow characteristicsand scavenging efficiency are very similar if the exhaust area of thetwo different configurations are equivalent.</TEXT></DOC>
