(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Navajos' suspended chairman has beencharged with taking more than $400,000 in bribes and kickbackswhile leader of the nation's biggest Indian tribe. He promised to``stand up and fight'' the allegations.   The criminal complaints filed Wednesday in Navajo Tribal Courtalso included charges of fraud, conspiracy and elections violationsagainst the suspended chairman, Peter MacDonald, who is underinvestigation by a special U.S. Senate committee.   Special prosecutors hired by the tribal council also filedcharges against MacDonald's son and the tribe's suspended vicechairman.   MacDonald was charged with more than 100 offenses. One complaintcharges him with bribery, fraud, ethics violations and conspiracyin the tribe's purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch in Arizona in1987.   A second complaint alleges violations of the Navajo electionlaw, including charges that MacDonald accepted $115,500 inundocumented cash and services from non-Indians and corporations.   A third charges him with bribery, extortion and other counts inconnection with consulting contracts MacDonald purportedly enteredinto with outside businesses in 1986 through 1989. Prosecutorsallege he pocketed more than $300,000.   MacDonald's son Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr. is charged withconspiracy in the ranch purchase in a fourth complaint andsuspended Vice Chairman Johnny R. Thompson is accused of ethicsviolations in a fifth.   The elder MacDonald said the charges were only a rehash ofallegations that surfaced during last winter's U.S. Senate hearings.   ``Those lazy, good-for-nothing lawyers'' spent thousands ofdollars to come up with nothing more than ``allegations using thetestimony of the Senate hearings,'' he said. The 60-year-oldMacDonald, who was put on paid administrative leave in February,said he had no plans to resign.   ``There's no reason to give up as long as I'm alive and I'mbreathing,'' he said. ``The cause is valid in terms of these people(supporters), and knowing what is happening to Indian nations _what has happened to the Navajo _ it affects my children and mygrandchildren, and I'll continue to stand up and fight.''   Tribal Interim Chairman Leonard Haskie, meanwhile, said he askedthe federal government to speed up its investigation of allegationsthat MacDonald shared in the $7.2 million profit turned by TraceyOil and Gas Co. of Scottsdale, which bought the Big Boquillas fromTenneco West for $26.2 million and sold it to the Navajos less than24 hours later for $33.4 million.   The complaint filed Wednesday alleges that MacDonald used hisposition to talk the council into allocating the money.   The tribe is suing MacDonald and others for $24 million indamages in the ranch purchase.   In January, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs beganan investigation of the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, but becameembroiled in probing corruption of various tribal leaders.   The most prominent target was MacDonald, who was in his fourthterm at the helm of the 225,000-member tribe.   Among witnesses who testified under immunity of MacDonald'staking kickbacks from contractors were Rocky MacDonald, who saidunder-the-table payments were referred to as ``golf balls.''   The elder MacDonald has maintained that taking gifts is aprerogative of Indian leaders.   He repeated his claim that the federal government wants to ousthim and other tribal leaders so it can plunder the naturalresources on reservations.   MacDonald made his comments Wednesday in this north-centralArizona community about 150 miles northwest of the tribal capitaland 250 miles north of Phoenix.   Appearance summonses will be mailed to MacDonald, his son andThompson. They have 14 days to respond, and no attempt will be madeto arrest the defendants until then, officials said.   Special prosecutor Robert Rothstein said in Window Rock that heand his Santa Fe, N.M., law firm investigated up to 100 past orpresent tribal officials and did not focus only on MacDonald.   If convicted on all counts, MacDonald could be sentenced to 15years in prison, fined up to $59,500 and prevented from holdingpublic office on the reservation for 114 years.   ``I'm glad they think I will live that long,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
