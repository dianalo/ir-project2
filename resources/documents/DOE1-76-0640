It comprises the steps of: operating the system in a twocylinder low speed heating mode when the temperature of the served spaceis in the third temperature range, switching from the two cylinder lowspeed heating mode to a two cylinder low speed cooling mode when thetemperature of the served space changes from the third temperature rangeto the second temperature range, activating a predetermined timing periodwhen the temperature of the served space changes from the third temperaturerange to the second temperature range, loading two additional cylindersof the compressor to operate in a four cylinder low speed cooling modein response to either of the following two trigger conditions occurringbefore the temperature of the served space again enters the third temperaturerange; and switching from the four cylinder low speed cooling mode toa six cylinder high speed cooling mode in response to the remaining triggercondition occurring before the temperature of the served space againenters the third temperature range.</TEXT></DOC>
