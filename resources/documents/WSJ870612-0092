Just Start Multiplying---By William M.                                                  </HL><SO>  </SO><IN> COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   COMPANIES PLANNING to cut computing costs by buying PCs should take a word of advice from Kavin Moody.    &quot;That $5,000 PC really costs $30,000 over a three-year period,&quot; explains Mr. Moody, Gillette Co.'s director of management information.    And while the money may be well spent, many buyers of technology don't anticipate the costs when they start out. Some of those costs are visible in department budgets -- software programs, peripheral equipment, communications connections, computer-magazine subscriptions. But others are harder to track: corporate support, time spent in training classes, distraction of the department's computer guru.    &quot;The real costs of computing are hidden costs,&quot; agrees David Ferris, chairman of Ferrin Corp., a San Francisco computer consultant. At Lear Siegler Inc., a Santa Monica, Calif.-based manufacturer, Larry R. DeJarnett, vice president, says, &quot;Our rule of thumb is that the cost of a major installation will be three times the cost of the hardware and software.&quot;    Some consultants have further quantified the hidden costs. Nolan, Norton andamp; Co., Lexington, Mass., recently calculated that a company amortizing a $5,000 computer over three years pays not only $1,667 a year for hardware, but almost $6,000 more a year for software, supplies and support. Ferrin estimates that connecting and using that personal computer on a network could cost an additional $8,000.    One reason such costs are rising is that computers are continually affecting more expensive people. A secretary learning to use a word processor might cost a company $10 an hour. An accountant learning a new auditing program tops $25 an hour in addition to the lost opportunity to be out auditing a client who pays $50 an hour.    Such calculations led Arthur Young andamp; Co. to buy Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computers for its accountants instead of International Business Machines Corp.'s PCs. Dana &quot;Rick&quot; Richardson, director of technology development at the accounting firm, says it takes a computer neophyte just two days to learn how to use a program on a Macintosh -- compared with about two weeks on an IBM PC. &quot;Our business is time,&quot; he says.    In addition, &quot;the real big hidden cost -- and the hardest to quantify -- is the cost of end users doing computer work,&quot; says Thomas F. O'Leary, a data processing executive at N.V. Philips's North American Philips Corp. in New York. &quot;You can identify the cost of a programmer. But what portion of a senior engineer or administrator should be apportioned to data processing?&quot;    Few doubt that automating can improve productivity. In fact, many companies say the biggest danger is delaying automation and losing the opportunity to work better or more productively for a number of months. Nevertheless, says Mr. DeJarnett of Lear Siegler, &quot;if one doesn't accurately look at the hidden costs, you're doing a bad cost analysis.&quot;    Small companies that are beginners with computers often have a particularly difficult time foreseeing the costs involved in automating. Yuri Alfisher, a consultant with DataLab Co. in Brookline, Mass., says, &quot;If you're a small company and sell something, you have to take time out of selling and learn about computers.&quot;    He cites a Massachusetts transportation broker who figured he could be more efficient by computerizing information about clients and freight rates. He bought a powerful personal computer and printer for about $6,000, Mr. Alfisher says.    But when he went looking for a database program to manage the information, he discovered that a programmer would have to design one at a cost of $25,000. Then there would be an additional $15,000 to put the information in and convert the company's manual bookkeeping. The broker dropped the idea and settled for using the computer as a word processor -- something he could have done with less than $4,000 of equipment at the time.    But even managers at large companies can miss potential pitfalls. One data-processing manager tells of scotching an automation plan for an East Coast factory.    A computer company had convinced the plant manager that he could save money by installing a complex of barcode readers in the warehouse to collect data. But information analysts at headquarters discovered that the East Coast managers had ignored the hidden costs of changing from the existing manual system. The installation would have caused weeks of disruption and lost orders or required expensive duplication of effort. Faced with this analysis, the plant manager simplified his procedures and avoided the need for new equipment.    Here are some of the hidden costs that are overlooked most often by small businesses and department heads guessing at computer costs.    --Backup and security: Corporate mainframes sit in locked and guarded facilities, and data-processing managers routinely route copies of important data to distant storehouses for safekeeping. &quot;That may be even more important at the micro level, but until people destroy their files, they don't give any thought to it,&quot; says Mr. O'Leary of North American Philips.    A company concerned about locking up valuable information might discover it costs less to use the central mainframe rather than to provide security for cheaper minicomputers in each department.    --Training: Computers are complex, and teaching about them takes time. Digital Equipment Corp. calculates that it presents more classroom hours yearly than Yale, Harvard and Princeton combined.    But even managers who pay lip service to training often underestimate the need. John Hickey, a former product manager for AMP Corp.'s keyboard division in Burlington, Mass., recalls that when a new computer system was installed, people skipped the training sessions and then didn't know how the system worked.    &quot;The new system wasn't getting used. Finally the vice president in charge said, 'You have to attend training sessions,' which of course took people away from what they should have been doing,&quot; he says.    --Support: Even after training, new questions arise. Companies need to keep an eye on new technology and software. Users may hear of products that would help them do their jobs and need help adding them to their personal computers. In most departments, a few people quickly grasp the technology and become resident experts.    But it may be costly to the company if an experienced salesman spends time helping co-workers instead of working the phones. Mark Tebbe, president of Lante Corp., a Chicago consulting firm, says that on average companies need one support person for every 25 PCs. But he says, &quot;In a sophisticated environment like Motorola, it might be one to 100.&quot; And he jokes, &quot;In an ad agency it ought to be one for four PCs.&quot;    --Communications: Sooner or later most people with personal computers want to use them to send messages and data. Costs then soar. Even small local area networks require a support person one day a week, consultants say. In existing buildings, especially in New York where union work rules affect installations, just putting in cables can cost more than $1,000 for each PC. And if a network breaks, it affects everyone on it.    --Fiddling: Because computers make it so easy to alter graphs and writing, users may become nit-picking perfectionists.    John McCarthy, analyst with Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting company, says, &quot;In our company we brought the graphics in house. Now, just because its easy to change, people figure we have to change it.&quot;    Mr. Richardson of Arthur Young says, &quot;Sometimes that universal word processor made by Sheaffer pens may be a better word processor. One hidden cost is making the wrong decision to automate in the first place.&quot;    ---   Mr. Bulkeley reports on technology from The Wall Street Journal's Boston bureau.    ---                      The Total Cost of a PC    Based on 100 personal computers shared by 300 users                                                 Annual Cost                                                     Per PC    Hardware    ($5,000 system amortized over 3 years)           $1,667    Software                                          1,200    Technical support    (2 people for total of $80,000)                     800    General support    (1 person at $40,000 for every 50 users)          2,400    Diskettes    (100 diskettes per user annually)                   900    Other supplies    (paper, ribbons, etc.)                              180    Maintenance    TOTAL ANNUAL COST PER COMPUTER                   $7,447    ---                     The Price of Networking    Based on annual costs on a 40-computer, local areanetwork, excluding cost of personal computers                                                Annual Cost                                                     Per PC    Hardware and software and installation             $567    Startup planning and analysis                       823    Systems management                                2,708    User training                                     2,812    Unproductive time                                 1,800    TOTAL ANNUAL COST PER COMPUTER                   $8,710    Source: Ferris Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
