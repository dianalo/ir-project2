The mice, developed through genetic engineering, areexpected to provide important clues about the chain ofbiological events that underlies the degenerative nervedisorder affecting four million Americans. Specifically, themice are bred to develop plaque deposits in their brainssimilar to those thought to destroy memory-carrying nervecells in Alzheimer's patients.</LP><TEXT>   Alzheimer's researchers expressed excitement at the news,saying the mice may give them the first animal model toinvestigate the disease and new tools in their search for thefirst medicines to truly slow or even stop the disease'sprogress.   &quot;It's quite an exciting research development because itinvolves an increasingly important question about thedisease,&quot; said Dennis Selkoe, a research neurologist atHarvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston.&quot;This, however, isn't a breakthrough that will mean anythingto patients in the very near future.&quot;   Laboratories around the world have been in a heated raceto develop breeds of mice carrying the human gene. Thewinners are a team of scientists at California BiotechnologyInc., of Mountain View, Calif., and Massachusetts GeneralHospital; a second from Bayer AG of Germany and its MilesResearch Center in West Haven, Conn.; and a third from theUniversity of California, Irvine.   Over the past few years, scientists have uncoveredevidence strongly suggesting that a protein chemical calledamyloid commonly litters the brains of Alzheimer's patients.Researchers can see these amyloid deposits only inpost-mortem brain dissections. Scientists have beenespecially frustrated in studying the deposits because theyhave no way to watch them grow or to measure their impact onbehavior.   The debate raging in Alzheimer's research is whether theamyloid actually kills nerve cells or whether the amyloid isdebris resulting when the nerve cells die from some otherstill unknown cause.   &quot;We hope the animal models will allow us, for the firsttime, to find out if the amyloid {deposits} cause the kindsof problems seen in Alzheimer's disease,&quot; said Dana Wirak, aresearcher at the Miles Research lab.   Mr. Wirak said the mice bred in the Miles lab havedeveloped Alzheimer's-like plaque in their brains. Butdetermining if the plaque causes Alzheimer's-like senilitymust await his group's experiments that begin this fall todetermine if the mice have memory and behavioral problems.   The amyloid theory received an important boost in Februarywhen British researchers found a defect in a gene passedalong in members of two families where the disease appears tobe inherited. All the relatives with the disease had thedefect, he said.   The mutation occurred in a gene that produces a naturalenzyme called amyloid precursor protein. Scientists now thinkthat when the gene is damaged, the enzyme somehow releases apart of itself in the form of amyloid. The amyloid thanattaches itself to nerve cells and kills them.   &quot;There is a growing belief that the amyloid plaque is cutaway from the precursor protein by other enzymes-sort ofmolecular scissors,&quot; said Dr. Selkoe of Harvard. &quot;The hotstrategy at drug companies is to identify these scissors andfigure out ways to block them with drugs.&quot; With the mice inhand, the drug makers will finally be able to test theutility of these drugs.   Eli Lilly andamp; Co., Upjohn Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,Bayer, California Biotech, and several other biotechcompanies are believed to be developing medicines this way.The drugs are thought to be years away from human tests.   There are about 13 medicines for Alzheimer's being testedin people, but none acts against the plaque deposits orundercuts the principal cause of the disease. Earlier thisweek, a panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administrationruled that the first of these medicines to come before theagency for approval, Warner Lambert Co.'s Cognex, also calledTHA, had yet to show it produced much benefit.   The Bayer-Miles research is being reported in the journalScience and simultaneously released with the CaliforniaBiotech team's report in the British journal Nature. TheUniversity of California team's report is expected to bepublished soon.</TEXT></DOC>
