The new Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency has 29countries which formally have accepted membership. Nine of them areindustrial nations, including the United States and Britain, whoseratifications arrived Tuesday. Another 34 governments of bothindustrial and Third World countries have signed the agreement butnot yet ratified it.   So far, Ecuador is the only Latin American government to ratify.Others, including Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, have not signed.Some Latin American countries have a strong tradition againstallowing foreigners any share in settling disputes with theircitizens, as might have to be done under the agreement setting upthe agency.   Conable said the new body's Governing Council will hold itsfirst meeting in Washington on June 8 to adopt bylaws and choose aboard of directors. He said he expects the new agency to be doingbusiness by the end of the year.   He added that after it is in operation it can take up a proposalthat originated with Japanese Financer Minister Kiichi Miyazawa toenable it to guarantee bank loans as well. Such operations wouldgreatly broaden its scope and probably require more capital.   The object of the new agency is to attract more directinvestment into Third World countries, to help them build theindustries they need so they can produce more goods, create jobsand make more payments on their debts. New investments also wouldreduce the need to add to their existing debt, now over $1 trillion.   It will begin with $1.08 billion, but only 10 percent of thatwill be paid in cash by the member governments. Conable will be itspresident as well as heading the bank.   The agency's immediate future was assured when Congress voted$44 million for U.S. participation at the end of last year. TheU.S. contribution will be the largest.   The United States already has its own agency to insure Americaninvestors, the Overseas Private Investment Corp. MIGA's serviceswill be available to investors from all member countries. Citizensof a host country also can be protected if they bring home assetsfrom abroad.   That provision is designed to help solve a major problem inThird World nations, the flight of billions of dollars that theircitizens have sent to the United States and other havens consideredsafer than their own territory.   In addition to protecting investors against war and civildisturbances, the agency's insurance policies will cut a company'slosses if the government of a country where the money is investedrestricts the right to take money out of the country, expropriatesproperty or repudiates a contract.   Other risks also can be covered by a decision of the agency'sboard of directors.</TEXT></DOC>
