This rule making action addresses three broad issues raised for commentin the Commission's ``Second Further Notice of Inquiry and Notice of ProposedRule Making in BC Docket No. 81-742,'' 53 FR 31894 (Aug. 22, 1988) (``SecondFurther Notice''), a comprehensive inquiry on reform of the broadcast licenserenewal process. 4. First, in response to troubling allegations that some parties mightbe using the license renewal process to obtain payments or benefits fromthe renewal applicant unrelated to legitimate public interest aims, theCommission invited public comment on this alleged abuse. Specifically,the Commission asked whether competing applications (applications for constructionpermits for broadcast facilities that are mutually exclusive with renewalapplications filed by incumbent licensees) and petitions to deny were beingfiled against license renewal applicants for the purpose of exacting largesettlement payments for dismissing these challenges, and whether limitationson settlement payments would help curb such abuse. Related to this issuewas whether the limits should extend to citizens' agreements (agreementsbetween broadcasters and citizens' groups generally regarding programmingor employment matters) reached in exchange for dismissing petitions todeny filed in the license renewal context. In response, virtually all commenters,representing both industry and public interest groups, asserted that abuseis a serious problem that warrants immediate Commission action. The clearmajority of commenters supported limitations on settlement payments forthe dismissal of both competing applications and petitions to deny. 5. Second, the Commission sought comment on whether it should modify itspolicy regarding enforcement of program-related promises made in citizens'agreements, ``Agreements Between Broadcast Licensees and the Public,''57 FCC 2d 42 (1975), particularly since it no longer required detailedprogramming proposals in conjunction with renewal applications and no longerapplied a ``promise versus performance'' standard to renewals. Accordingly,the Commission asked whether it should eliminate its policy of regardingprogram-related promises made in citizens' agreements as commitments tothe Commission to be relied upon in its decision making processes. Onlya few parties (five of twenty-nine commenters and reply commenters) addressedthe issue of enforcement of citizens' agreements. The majority of theseurge the Commission to maintain its current enforcement policies. 6. Finally, the Commission sought comment on whether it should eliminatewhat is known as the <T3>Cameron </T3>doctrine, a policy that allowed a competing applicantin a comparative renewal proceeding to presume that the incumbent licensee'stransmitter site would be available to it if it prevailed. <T3>See George E. Cameron Jr. Communications, </T3>71 FCC 2d 460 (1979).The Commission was concerned that the presumption, among other things,facilitated the filing of non <T3>bona fide </T3>applications by permitting renewal challengers merelyto clone technical proposals submitted by the renewal applicants. All ofthe eight commenters that addressed the issue advocated elimination ofthe <T3>Cameron </T3>presumption. 7. The Commission also sought comment on other proposed reforms of thelicense renewal process, but stated they would be resolved separately.First, it sought comment on whether it should modify FCC Form 301 to requirecompeting applicants in the license renewal context to submit additionalinformation as another means of deterring non <T3>bona fide </T3>applicants. The Commission incorporated the record regardingForm 301 into General Docket No. 88-328, which dealt with proposed Form301 amendments for all construction permit applications, including thosein the renewal context. The Commission adopted a ``Report and Order inGen. Docket No. 88-328,'' FCC 89-110, 54 FR 19951 (May 9, 1989), whichamended Form 301 to require all applicants for construction permits toprovide more financial, ownership, and integration information. 8. The Commission also sought comment on proposals for reforming the standardsused in comparative hearings to determine whether an incumbent licenseeor a competing applicant will best serve the public interest, convenience,and necessity. Specifically, the Commission sought comment on proposalsto clarify its standards for awarding a so-called ``renewal expectancy,''a credit awarded to incumbent licensees for ``meritorious'' service thatmeets the needs and interests of its community of license; and on proposalsto eliminate or reduce in weight certain of the criteria used to compareincumbent licensees and competing applicants in a renewal proceeding.For reasons stated in a separate ``Third Further Notice of Inquiry andNotice of Proposed Rule Making in BC Docket No. 81-742,'' FCC 89-109 (adoptedMarch 30, 1989), the Commission decided to seek comment on an additionalproposal for making the Commission's renewal expectancy standard more concreteand less subject to protracted litigation and abuse. It stated that thoseportions of BC Docket No. 81-742 pertaining to the renewal expectancy standard,as well as the other comparative criteria, would therefore be held openpending further comment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Rule and Policy Changes </ITAG>9. <T3>Settlement Limitations. </T3>Based upon a careful review of the record,as well as its own experience in administering the licensing process, theCommission recognized that its existing policies, albeit unintentionally,were providing mechanisms and incentives for abuse of its processes. Asone measure to curb the abuse, the Commission imposed limitations on settlementsof license renewal challenges. With regard to settlements of competingapplications, the Commission banned all payments to competing applicants(other than the incumbent licensee) for withdrawing an application priorto the Initial Decision stage of a comparative hearing, and thereafter,restricted payments to the legitimate and prudent expenses of the withdrawingapplicant. With regard to settlements of petitions to deny license renewalapplications, the Commission's new policies depend on whether the petitionis dismissed in exchange for money or promises to implement some type ofnonfinancial reform. Where a petition is dismissed for money, the Commissionlimited any settlement payments to the legitimate and prudent expensesof the withdrawing petitioner. Where a petition is dismissed for a promiseby the licensee to implement a nonfinancial reform, such a settlement,which is generally referred to as a citizens' agreement, must be reviewedand approved by the Commission under its public interest standard. In reviewingsuch agreements, the Commission stated that it would apply a rebuttablepresumption that any agreement in which the petitioner is paid to performthe promised reform would be regarded as contrary to the public interest.10. The Commission imposed limitations on settlements of competing applicationsto assure that such applications are filed for the purpose of obtaininga broadcast license rather than to settle out for a profit. It stated thatbanning payments for settlements of all pre-Initial Decision applicationsshould also: (1) Increase the likelihood that only serious, <T3>bona fide </T3>applicants (those that are willing to develop a completerecord of the issues) will have the opportunity to settle for expenses;(2) prevent non <T3>bona fide </T3>applicants from exerting undue pressure on incumbentsto settle early in a comparative proceeding; and (3) encourage all applicants(knowing they will only be able to settle for expenses if they survivethe hearing) to evaluate the risks and benefits of their applications beforefiling. Moreover, by permitting post-Initial Decision settlements for expenses,the Commission recognized that settlements, where abuse is not a factor,can be an efficient means to terminate a renewal challenge. 11. The Commission determined that these limitations do not apply to thedismissal of a renewal application by an incumbent licensee. The Commissionfound that it is unlikely that an incumbent has filed a renewal applicationwith the intent of settling out for a profit. Moreover, a licensee thatno longer wishes to be in the broadcast business should be permitted todismiss a renewal application with no restrictions. 12. In imposing limitations on settlements of competing applications, theCommission addressed the issue of whether the particular limitations imposedwere authorized by section 311(d), of the Communications Act. Section 311(d)was amended in 1981 to provide that the Commission shall approve a settlementagreement ``only if it determines that (A) the agreement is consistentwith the public interest, convenience, or necessity; and (B) no party tothe agreement filed its application for the purpose of reaching or carryingout such agreement.'' 13. Upon close scrutiny of the statute, the legislative history, and thecomments submitted regarding the Commission's authority under section 311(d),the Commission determined that nothing in the statute denies the Commissionthe authority to establish reasonable parameters for when and under whatcircumstances payments pursuant to settlement agreements do not serve thepublic interest. First, settlement restrictions are completely consistentwith the plain language of section 311(d). The only constraint on the Commission'sauthority to approve settlements is that they must be consistent with thepublic interest, and the application must not have been filed for the purposeof reaching the settlement. Second, the Conference Report only instructsthat section 311(d) was intended to prevent a person from filing a ``frivolousapplication * * * to harass an incumbent'' or to ``offer[ ] to withdrawthe frivolous applications upon payment of money * * *.'' This is preciselythe intent of the settlement limitations the Commission imposed. Moreover,nothing in the statutory language or the legislative history requires theCommission to proceed on an <T3>ad hoc, </T3>case-by-case basis. Instead, the statute merely makesexplicit the Commission's broad authority to decide what settlement standardwould best serve the public interest. 14. In imposing settlement limitations, the Commission stated that it wouldno longer adhere to its prior reasoning in <T3>Western Connecticut Broadcasting Co., </T3>88 FCC 2d 1492 (1982). In<T3>Western Connecticut, </T3>the Commission eliminated a legitimate andprudent expense limitation that it imposed on settlements of competingapplications prior to the enactment of section 311(d). In so doing, theCommission noted that since settlements would be reviewed in accordancewith the newly amended section 311(d), there was no further need for thesettlement limitations. After careful examination, the Commission statedthat it did not sufficiently consider other factors that bear on settlementsin the renewal context, including the potential for abuse. It decided,therefore, expressly to depart from <T3>Western Connecticut. </T3>15. The Commission also imposed legitimate and prudent expense limitationson monetary settlements of petitions to deny license renewal applicationsto remove the profit motive for filing petitions to deny. The Commissionpermitted recovery of expenses, rather than impose a complete ban on settlementpayments, because it was concerned that banning all settlement paymentsin connection with petitions to deny would seriously impede the monitoringand regulatory function of such petitions. The Commission essentially believedit would be inappropriate to ask the public to incur considerable out-of-pocketexpenses in order to alert it to licensee deficiencies with no possibilityof reimbursement. The Commission decided that the legitimate and prudentexpense limitation would strike the appropriate balance between deterringabuse and not discouraging the filing of petitions to deny.16. The Commission decided that different limitations for competing applicationsand petitions to deny were warranted because, among other things, differentincentives were operative. Unlike petitioners, a competing applicant standsto gain a very valuable broadcast license. The inability to collect attorney'sfees and expenses in settlements of competing applications does not prevent<T3>bona fide </T3>applicants from trying to obtain a license. In contrast,if the Commission were to prohibit petitioners from recovering fees andexpenses, there would be an economic disincentive to file a petition todeny. 17. Finally, the Commission decided that its new policy of reviewing nonfinancialsettlements, or citizens' agreements, on a case-by-case basis appropriatelytakes into account that concessions extracted from a licensee in citizens'agreements can be merely disguised payoffs for dismissing a renewal challenge.The Commission's rebuttable presumption, that any agreements that callfor the petitioner to be paid for carrying out a programming or employmentinitiative are contrary to the public interest, recognizes that such arrangementsare particularly susceptible to abuse. The Commission noted that this policyapplies only to citizens' agreements reached in exchange for dismissinga petition to deny in the license renewal context and, therefore, it didnot reach the question whether such agreements in other contexts providethe potential for abuse of Commission processes. 18. <T3>Enforcement of Citizens' Agreements. </T3>The Commission also determinedthat it would no longer enforce citizens' agreements containing licenseerepresentations related to programming matters. As a result of its deregulatoryinitiatives, the Commission no longer applies a ``promise versus performance''standard to renewal applications. Consequently, it found that promisesregarding programming contained in citizens' agreements were, in general,no longer germane to the Commission's decision making process. The Commissionnoted that this change in policy would not apply to citizens' agreementsregarding EEO or other nonprogram-related aspects of a station's operations.19. <T3>Cameron Policy. </T3>Finally, the Commission eliminated the <T3>Cameron </T3>doctrine, a policy that allowed competing applicants ina comparative renewal proceeding to presume that they could acquire theincumbent licensee's transmitter site if they prevailed. It did so fora number of reasons. First, the <T3>Cameron </T3>presumption was permitting license renewal challengers,who were relying on an incumbent's transmitter in their application, tosimply copy the incumbent's technical proposal. This in turn facilitatedthe filing of non <T3>bonafide </T3>applications, and operated unfairly to neutralize anadvantage in the comparative hearing that an incumbent had earned. Further,the presumption was unrealistic because a site might truly be unavailable.Relying on this presumption potentially disserved the public because itallowed an applicant, that did not have an available site, to be granteda license. As a consequence, competing applicants can not rely upon thisdoctrine but must provide reasonable assurance of site availability. <ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Matters</ITAG>20. The rule and policy changes in this ``Report and Order'' will becomeeffective on June 28, 1989, subject to approval by the Office of Managementand Budget. The policies will apply to all prospective competing applicationsand petitions to deny, as well as those applications and petitions thatare on file with the Commission, but have not been designated for a hearingas of the effective date of the ``Report and Order''. The policies willnot apply to any post-designation applications or petitions, or to anycompeting applications that have been settled and presented to the Commissionfor approval prior to the effective date. The <T3>Cameron </T3>policy change will apply to all prospective and pre-designationapplications as of the effective date. Any pre-designation applicants thathave relied on the <T3>Cameron </T3>presumption will have 30 days from the effective dateof the ``Report and Order'' to supplement their application to show siteavailability. 21. In order to aid with the enforcement of the Commission's new settlementlimitations, the Commission adopted a series of disclosure and certificationrequirements which are contained in andSection;andSection; 73.3523 and 73.3524.These rules are set out in full in the Amendatory Text below. The Commissionintends to enforce its policies and rules using the full panoply of penaltiesavailable against all persons who fail to comply. 22. <T3>Final Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis. </T3>Pursuant to the RegulatoryFlexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605, it is certified that the adoptedrules will not have a significant negative impact on a substantial numberof small entities. The policy and rule changes will affect broadcast licenseeswho are seeking license renewal, applicants for construction permits forbroadcast facilities that are mutually exclusive with facilities subjectto license renewal, and persons or groups filing petitions to deny licenserenewals. The policy and rule changes implemented herein, which are intendedto eliminate or reduce abuse of the Commission's license renewal process,should benefit all licensees, competing applicants and petitioners, includingthe small entities. The Commission has considered that limitations on settlementsof petitions to deny have the potential to discourage citizens' groupsfrom filing petitions. The Commission believes that its legitimate andprudent expense limitation on settlements of petitions strikes the appropriatebalance between the need to discourage abuse of its process without discouragingthe filing of legitimate petitions to deny. 23. <T3>Ordering Clauses. </T3>Authority for the rule changes is containedin Sections 4 (i) and (j), 301, 303, 308 and 309 of the CommunicationsAct of 1934, as amended. 24. Accordingly, <T3>it is ordered, </T3>That the policies and the amendments to the Commission'sRules and Regulations set forth in the Amendatory Text below shall becomeeffective on June 28, 1989, subject to Office of Management and Budgetapproval. 25. <T3>It is further ordered, </T3>That the portions of this proceeding relatedto the renewal expectancy factor and the comparative renewal criteria (PartsIII, IV and V of the ``Second Further Notice'') are held open pending furthercomment on these issues pursuant to a ``Third Further Notice of Inquiryand Notice of Inquiry and Notice of Proposed Rule Making'' in this proceeding.26. <T3>It is further ordered</T3>, that the part of this proceeding relatedto amendments to FCC Form 301 (paragraphs 25-29 of the ``Second FurtherNotice''), the policies related thereto, and the comments and reply commentsreceived in response thereto are incorporated into General Docket No. 88-328.This proceeding has been resolved by a Report and Order adopted March 30,1989. (54 FR 19951, May 9, 1989.)27. <T3>It is further ordered,</T3> that, except as specified in Paragraphs25-26 above, this proceeding is terminated.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 73</ITAG>Radio broadcasting, Television broadcasting.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendatory Text</ITAG>Part 73 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended to readas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 73_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
