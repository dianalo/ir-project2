The law requires the wait between sale and receipt of a handgunto allow police time to check whether the prospective buyer has acriminal record or is mentally incompetent.   Until now, guns could be picked up immediately and police had totrack the buyers down if there were reasons to prevent them frombuying guns. Cincinnati's ordinance is based on an Ohio law thatallows cities to enact local gun control measures.   The National Rifle Association, which lobbied against theordinance, said Cincinnati's law goes farther than measures in othercities because it applies to individuals who sell guns, as well asto commercial gun dealers.   The law requires anyone selling, renting, leasing or transferringownership or possession of a handgun to notify police of thetransaction and fill out an application form. Forms are available atpolice district stations and the city Safety Department offices.   The ordinance does not cover rifles or shotguns.   Violation is a first-degree misdemeanor with a maximum $1,000fine and six months in jail.   Three stores in Cincinnati now sell handguns. Retailers say it istoo soon to tell what impact the ordinance will have on sales.</TEXT></DOC>
