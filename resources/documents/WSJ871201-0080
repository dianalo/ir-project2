Separately, researchers at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital, who are conducting studies with the experimental system, reported that the system promises to improve the diagnosis of heart and liver diseases. At a scientific meeting in Chicago, one of the scientists said the new MRI system can make a &quot;movie-like&quot; sequence of pictures of the beating heart.    MRI scanners use a combination of magnetic fields and radio waves to make pictures of internal organs. During the past five years, the machines have become increasingly popular diagnostic tools in U.S. hospitals because of their ability to make detailed images of tissues without use of X-rays.    Conventional MRI scanners, however, typically require several minutes to make images. That can cause distortions in images of organs that move, such as hearts.    Advanced NMR said its new scanner, which uses a more powerful magnetic field than conventional MRI machines, can make up to 16 &quot;snapshot&quot; images a second, enabling doctors to see heart problems that can't be detected with conventional MRI machines. </TEXT></DOC>
