His goals include expelling foreign workers and people who havesought asylum in West Germany.   ``Right after the banning of the Nationale Sammlung, I formed anew organization with the name Initiative Volkswille (Popular WillInitiative),'' Michael Kuehnen said. ``I want to keep beingpolitically active.''   Kuehnen said he hoped to run candidates in municipal elections inNorth Rhine-Westphalia state this autumn.   In Bonn, Interior Ministry spokesman Michael-Andreas Butz saidThursday's ban of the Nationale Sammlung a was a success and notedthat the order would keep the party out of city elections inFrankfurt and Langen next month. There was no official to Kuehnen'sannouncement that he had formed a new group.   Nationale Sammlung had entered candidates in the Frankfurt andLangen elections. Its platform included renaming a railway stationafter Adolf Hitler.   An appeals court ruled Friday that the radical right-wing GermanNational Democratic Party may hold a two-day rally this weekend atRahden.   Officials in Rahden, about 35 miles south of Bremen, said theyhad forbidden the rally because they feared violence. A court inMinden rejected the ban and the appeals court in Muenster agreed.   More than 1,000 people are expected to attend the annual rally ofthe party, which seeks the expulsion of foreigners to maintain a``national German identity.''   Kuehnen, who has spent more than seven years in prison for hisneo-Nazi activities, spoke to reporters outside a Munich court,where he was fined $490 for holding an illegal rally there in theBavarian capital in May.   He said most members of his new group belonged to NationaleSammlung. and ``We want to do away with the system.''   Police raided homes of Nationale Sammlung members, confiscatingguns, knives, ammunition and Nazi propaganda.   ``The Gruesome Dreams of Neo-Nazi Kuehnen,'' said a headline inthe mass-circulation newspaper Bild.   It quoted Kuehnen as saying Hitler ``is for me the greatestGerman in our history. We're continuing what he wanted.''   The crackdown on Kuehnen's 170-member group came as West Germanswarily eye a possible resurgence of right-wing extremism.   Opposition Social Democrats in the Parliament scheduled a hearingWednesday to discuss the Republican Party, another extremeright-wing group that made a strong showing in West Berlin electionslast month.   The Social Democrats want to question domestic intelligenceexperts about what they know about the party, headed by former NaziWaffen SS soldier Franz Schoenhuber.   Social Democrats have long argued that official governmentfigures fail to take account of all extreme-rightist tendencies. Thenumber of such extremists is now estimated at 28,300 nationwide,with more than 1,500 classified as neo-Nazis.   In founding the Nationale Sammlung last summer, Kuehnen and hisfollowers wrote: ``We must create a national-revolutionary andsocial-revolutionary alternative. We must make protest-voters awareof this alternative.''   The federal government cited that statement to justify itsargument the Nationale Sammlung was attacking West Germany'sdemocratic system and should be banned.</TEXT></DOC>
