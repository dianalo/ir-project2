Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> DENVER  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis stumped the West hitting hard at rival George Bush and invoking for himself every underdog champion from Harry Truman to the World Series Dodgers.    Vice President Bush, meanwhile, took a defensive tack, also appearing here before moving on to California. He lambasted his opponent as &quot;naive&quot; on national security issues and an advocate of failed economic policies and a highly centralized government.    In the closing days of the presidential campaign, both candidates zeroed in on the industrial Midwest, the Pacific Northwest, and the big electoral prize, California, as well as a few other states, such as Colorado, where the race has tightened in recent days.    Drawing energy from enthusiastic crowds here and in Portland, Ore., the underdog Mr. Dukakis repeatedly sounded his new campaign slogan -- &quot;We're on Your Side&quot; -- as a rallying cry for a host of initiatives to promote jobs, health care and education. Though still reserved on the stump, he sought to drive home his economic populism by portraying himself as a fighter, punctuating his remarks with an occasional &quot;hell&quot; or &quot;I'll be damned.&quot;    The Democrat sharply stepped up his criticism of Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, portraying the conservative Indiana senator as someone to be feared. In an interview broadcast Saturday, Mr. Bush had said he might put Mr. Quayle in charge of the &quot;crisis management&quot; team within the National Security Council. &quot;It gives you the chills,&quot; replied Mr. Dukakis. &quot;Think about it. Dan Quayle in charge of the Cuban missile crisis? . . . Dan Quayle isn't a crisis manager. He's a crisis that has to be managed.&quot;    The governor also stepped up his attacks on the credibility of the Bush campaign in an effort to blunt GOP attacks that he is outside the mainstream of American values. &quot;They are engaged in a scorched earth policy against the truth,&quot; the governor said in a paid five-minute television message this weekend. By contrast, Mr. Dukakis portrayed himself as the &quot;clean&quot; candidate, promising to bring &quot;clean air, clean water, a clean environment and clean government&quot; back to Washington.    In the final days of his campaign, Mr. Dukakis appeared upbeat and more relaxed than usual, voicing confidence that he is overtaking Mr. Bush. &quot;He's slipping and sliding, we're rocking and rolling,&quot; he said in Denver before flying to the Pacific Northwest.    Mr. Bush, meanwhile, warned in nearby Colorado Springs and again before a throng in Los Angeles, that this wasn't the time to &quot;risk&quot; the nation's defenses on a &quot;liberal governor&quot; who isn't tested in national security affairs. &quot;A president must have the experience to know when and how to prudently use U.S. power when necessary, and I am the man that understands that,&quot; he said. &quot;We simply cannot risk the potential of world peace on the inexperience of a liberal governor.&quot;    Also in Los Angeles, Mr. Bush hit back at charges that he has run a negative campaign. He said he was &quot;sick and tired&quot; of the &quot;daily whining&quot; and the &quot;crying on the far Left&quot; about his campaign rhetoric. He asserted that the negative tone of the campaign began &quot;at that idiotic Democratic convention.&quot;    Mr. Bush said he was seeking &quot;a mandate from the mainstream of America to hold down the taxes, keep America strong, to stand up for family values, to improve our schools and protect our environment and create opportunity for every single citizen of this great land.&quot;    He added that the campaign presents &quot;a choice between growth and opportunity and hope, or a future of recession, stagnation, highly centralized government and, I will then add, decline.&quot;    In one of his few specific comments on what he would do as president, Mr. Bush said over the weekend that he favors extending the controversial &quot;voluntary restraint program,&quot; which limits steel imports. Steel companies such as USX Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp. are major employers in Pennsylvania, and the state's Republican Sen. John Heinz predicted recently that if Mr. Bush didn't back the import-restraint program, he would lose the state and its 25 electoral votes. Since the beginning of the campaign, Mr. Dukakis has endorsed extending the program.    For both candidates, a big prize remains California, where the Democrats plan rallies today in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The Republicans will have President Reagan and former President Gerald Ford in the state today. Mr. Dukakis also plans appearances in Ohio and Missouri, while Mr. Bush is scheduled to campaign in Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and Texas.    Texas is further out of reach for Mr. Dukakis after a new GOP television barrage. His appearance before loyal Hispanic voters in Hidalgo County late Saturday was poignant. In Spanish and English, he was welcomed by House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. &quot;Kika&quot; de la Garza as &quot;our tender friend&quot; with the &quot;sad look and gentle smile.&quot; Though not admitting defeat, Mr. Dukakis spoke of his candidacy as a consolation in itself for other children of immigrants.    ---   Rick Wartzman in Pittsburgh contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
