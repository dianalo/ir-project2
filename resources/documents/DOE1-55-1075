These procedures were needed by the General ServicesAdministration (GSA) for installation of sprinkler systems in buildingshaving fireproofing containing asbestos. A prototype floor slab havingspray-on friable mineral wool fireproofing was used in laboratory tests.The mineral-wool fireproofing was used as a model system for fireproofingcontaining asbestos. The various combinations of mechanical anchoringprocedures (use of drills or powder-actuated gun) and encapsulation procedurestested limited the fiber release to a range of values of 0.000 to 0.055f/cc (fibers per cubic centimeter) as compared to a range of values of0.26 to 0.82 f/cc for procedures without encapsulation. Encapsulationwas shown to be effective as evidenced by much higher levels of fiberrelease during testing without encapsulation. Because there is no knowncorrelation between the release of mineral-wool fibers and asbestos fibers,it was recommended that the procedures developed be evaluated by GSAin buildings having fireproofing containing asbestos. An air-samplingprotocol was developed for use by GSA in evaluating the procedures inthe field. Subsequently field tests were conducted by GSA. The laboratoryand field studies provided GSA with an effective procedure, measurementmethod, and decision tool for installing sprinkler hanger anchors insteel deck/concrete floor slabs having fireproofing materials.</TEXT></DOC>
