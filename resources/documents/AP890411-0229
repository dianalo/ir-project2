Gold prices edged lower in U.S. trading, reversing course aftermoving up on markets overseas. Republic National Bank of New Yorkquoted a bid of $384.90 for a troy ounce of gold, down fromMonday's late bid of $385.20.   The dollar's increase came despite intervention by the FederalReserve. Dealers in New York said the U.S. central bank solddollars at one point but the dollar ended the day near its highestlevels of the session anyway.   Bob Morrissey, senior trader in the Bank of Boston's New Yorkoffice, said trading was somewhat subdued, probably becausemanagers of corporate currency portfolios and other dealers aretaking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of potentially market-movinggovernment statistics due later this week.   The Commerce Department reports on March retail sales Thursdayand the Labor Department issues the Producer Price Index thefollowing day.   ``It really was a fairly quiet day,'' said Morrissey. ``Thedollar was fairly well bid and closed near its highs of the day.There were really no factors except market sentiment that pushed ithigher.''
