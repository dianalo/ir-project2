The new job cuts, combined with other fresh cost-saving measures, are expected to reduce annual expenses by $95 million when they are fully implemented over the next three years, Pratt said.    Pratt's latest move brings the total salaried positions slated for elimination to 2,650 since June, or 14% of an initial U.S. white-collar work force of 19,000 employees. These cutbacks and other measures will reduce Pratt's annual operating expenses by about $300 million, a spokesman said. The non-personnel related savings involve increased efficiencies in data processing and in the use of fuel and hardware for development engines; and reductions in &quot;premium outside services,&quot; supplies and equipment, and travel.    Pratt, a unit of Hartford-based United Technologies Corp., has lost a large chunk of its engine market share to GE in recent years. A Pratt spokesman said the recent cuts, resulting from a cost-analysis program begun in January, are intended to enable the company to recapture its lost business for jet engines. &quot;I'm proud of this effort, though it was painful to separate so many people,&quot; said Pratt's president, Arthur E. Wegner.    Of the 1,042 positions just targeted, 526 people left the company yesterday and 285 others left through normal attrition since the start of the year, Pratt said. The jobs affected in the latest round of cuts involve manufacturing, overhaul and repair, and manufacturing-related information services.    Employees whose jobs have been cut will receive a two-week notice, one week of severance pay for each year of service, health and insurance coverage for two months, outplacement assistance, and a $3,000 transition payment, Pratt said. </TEXT></DOC>
