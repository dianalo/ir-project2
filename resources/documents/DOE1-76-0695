<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-0695 </DOCNO><TEXT>An internal combustion engine throttle valve control system is describedcomprising driving means for driving a throttle valve so that the openingof the throttle valve assumes a predetermined value in accordance withthe amount of change in the position of an accelerator pedal, enginer.p.m. detecting means for detecting engine r.p.m. and outputting a signalrepresenting the detected engine r.p.m. and control means for controllingthe rate of driving the throttle valve which receive the signal outputfrom the engine r.p.m. detecting means. It produces, in accordance withthe rate of change in the position of the accelerator pedal, a firstsignal to drive the throttle valve at a first rate corresponding to therate of change in the position of the accelerator pedal under a conditionwhere the amount of change in the position of the accelerator pedal isnot larger than a predetermined value and a second signal to drive thethrottle valve at a second rate smaller than the first rate under thecondition where the amount of change in the position of the acceleratorpedal is larger than the predetermined value. The rate of change in theposition of the accelerator pedal is larger than a predetermined valueand the engine r.p.m. is smaller than a predetermined value and controlsthe driving means in accordance with the engine operating condition.</TEXT></DOC>
