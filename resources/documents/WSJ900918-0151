The official explanation of Mr. Masaryk's death wassuicide. But the circumstances surrounding it have fueledspeculation ever since.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Dienstbier suddenly moves toward the ledge. &quot;You seehow easy it would be to fall,&quot; he says. Then he laughs andadds, &quot;Don't worry, I won't jump.&quot;   Mr. Dienstbier isn't about to do anything desperate, buthis dark joke reflects how much Prague's euphoria hasevaporated since Czechoslovakia's velvet revolution toppledthe Communists last November. Like many other East Europeanleaders vaulted from opposition to power, Mr. Dienstbier cameto office believing that his most important task was toconsolidate freedom from the Soviet Union and democracy athome. Now, he finds himself confronted with the practicalproblems of foreign trade and a collapsing economy.   &quot;Dienstbier is like many of the other philosophers runningthis country,&quot; complains Karel Dyba, finance minister for thenew Czech Republic. &quot;He doesn't seem to understand thatunless we act on the economy, nothing else we do will count.&quot;   In his apartment at the 17th-century Cernin Palace, whichserves as Czechoslovakia's Foreign Ministry, a weary Mr.Dienstbier acknowledges that he underestimated the difficultyof economic overhaul. He and his former prisonmate, PresidentVaclav Havel, have now begun to warn their countrymen thatpainful austerity lies ahead. Mr. Dienstbier says he has beenworking until 2 a.m. dealing with crisis after crisis: theabrupt reduction of Soviet oil deliveries, the rupture ofEast German commercial contracts and now the Persian Gulf oilshock.   &quot;It was easier to make a revolution than to write 600 to800 laws to create a market economy,&quot; he sighs.   For Mr. Dienstbier, Mr. Havel and other former dissidents,toppling the old Communist regime was like a fairy tale. Mr.Dienstbier had been fired from his position as a CzechoslovakRadio foreign correspondent for opposing the 1968 Sovietinvasion and was forced to work as a furnace stoker in theconstruction of the city subways. In 1977, he helped foundthe Charter 77 human-rights group, which led to hisimprisonment.   When his role as a spokesman in last fall's revolution wonhim appointment as foreign minister in the new governmentlast December, he joked that he couldn't take the post untilhe found a replacement for his coal-shoveling job.   Since taking office, Mr. Dienstbier has launched a seriesof innovative plans, including a proposed Arab-Israeli peacesettlement and a program to give Western aid to the SovietUnion to be spent on East European goods. Above all, he hasargued for creation of a Pan-European security structure toreplace both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and theWarsaw Pact. The calls to dissolve NATO created a storm ofcriticism in some Western capitals, particularly Washington.&quot;The Americans are furious with Dienstbier,&quot; a Westerndiplomat says.   While Mr. Dienstbier's grand ideas for reshaping Europehave turned Czechoslovakia into a lively, if controversial,diplomatic player, the more mundane and intractable problemsof foreign trade frustrate the foreign minister. He hasembraced German political unity, saying a democratic Germanyrepresents no danger for Europe. But he worries about Germaneconomic unity; East German companies have refused sincemonetary union to take nonconvertible Czech crowns as paymentand have stopped commercial deliveries.   Mr. Dienstbier says West Germany must pay reparations forthe Czech losses. &quot;Many of our companies will go bankruptunless the East Germans keep their contracts,&quot; he says.   Dealing with Moscow is even more complicated. PresidentHavel and Mr. Dienstbier have negotiated the withdrawal ofSoviet troops from Czechoslovakia, and Mr. Dienstbier says hehas no fundamental differences with Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev. But he expresses alarm about the Soviet decisionthis summer to reduce oil deliveries 30%. And he says thelack of strong authority in Moscow makes it difficult tocement agreements.   &quot;You just don't know who is responsible there,&quot; hecomplains. &quot;If you make an agreement with the centralgovernment about oil or anything else, you don't know if theRussian Republic will cancel it the next day.&quot;   Similar difficulties exist in relations with otherneighbors. While a dissident, he forged close links with theleaders of Poland's Solidarity that he hoped would create analliance between the two neighboring Slavic states. Theyhaven't.   Against his earlier wishes, Mr. Dienstbier ended upkeeping tight border controls between Czechoslovakia andPoland after the Ministry of Foreign Trade persuaded him suchcontrols were necessary to prevent a run on inexpensive Czechgoods. &quot;It's terrible,&quot; he says. &quot;The borders go down in theWest and up in the East.&quot;   Another nagging problem concerns his own ministry's heavybureaucracy, inherited from the Communists and filled withscores of incompetent careerists. Since taking office, Mr.Dienstbier has shaken up Czechoslovakia's diplomaticestablishment by naming some old dissident friends toambassadorships. He also has dismissed some secret-policespies.   But critics say he hasn't done enough to get rid of theincompetents or those who oppose democracy. &quot;Dienstbier isjust too nice, he just can't bear to fire people,&quot; says oneclose associate in private. &quot;For every new diplomat like me,there are three from the old regime.&quot;   Sitting in his small apartment in the palace, Mr.Dienstbier doesn't hide the difficulties. &quot;There are timeswhen I feel like a prisoner of this chateau,&quot; he says. &quot;Youcan't change everything overnight.&quot;   He points to his bedroom where three open suitcasesoverflow with dirty clothes. &quot;Sometimes I wish I still was astoker,&quot; he says. &quot;At least then I got some sleep.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
