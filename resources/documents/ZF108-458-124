 The newestversion of Microsoft Corp.'s operating environment finally alleviates the640K-byte memory limitation imposed by DOS, which many developers say haskept them from working together to build data links between applications.andO;(See story, Page S/31.)andM;Under previous versions of Windows, users had barely enough memory to runmore than a couple Windows applications at once, much less worry aboutsharing data and files among applications or linking several applications toperform a single computing task.andP;  Now that Windows 3.0 eliminates thatproblem, developers say they have a fresh incentive.andP;  For the first time,many are looking seriously at providing software with the ability to link toother applications, even competing ones.andM;Microsoft and third-party Windows developers are tackling integration fromseveral directions: enhancing existing standards, such as the dynamic dataexchange (DDE) messaging protocol; creating better accessibility to oldstandards, such as the dynamic link library (DLL) programming method; anddeveloping new standards altogether.andP;  Also under way is a related movement tocreate small, auxiliary programs that users can plug into Windowsapplications for enhanced functionality.andM;&quot;It's terrific to see,&quot; said Mike Conte, a product manager at Microsoft inRedmond, Wash.andP;  &quot;Environments like Windows allow such tight integration.andO;With more [memory] available, you're going to see a movement away fromkitchen-sink applications and toward a Tinkertoy approach where users canplug functions from many applications together.&quot;andM;Products such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word and Precision SoftwareInc.'s Superbase 4 are the first in a new breed of Windows applicationsallowing other vendors to write DLLs that users can transparently plug intoan application's scripting language.andM;Several vendors are already breaking out code from their Windows products andmarketing them as add-ins for Word, Excel, Superbase 4 and other productsthat include scripting languages.andP;  For instance, Pinnacle Publishing Inc.andO;this month began shipping its Graphics Server, a library of charting andgraphing features that users can access from their Word, Excel or Superbase 4applications.andM;Once an auxiliary program is installed and linked to an application, userscan employ Graphics Server's charting capabilities by selecting them fromtheir main application's menu, without ever having to know that the GraphicsServer functions are exterior to their application.andM;&quot;We feel that this is one of the benefits of Windows that few people havegrasped yet -- that users can build entire solutions by adding up bits ofseveral different products,&quot; said John Tramner, president of PrecisionSoftware in Irving, Texas.andM;Basil Maloney, executive director of the Windows/Presentation ManagerAssociation (WPMA) takes Tramner's idea a step further.andP;  &quot;I believe that awhole new industry will evolve around Windows to provide add-in solutions forcustomers, much like what evolved around dBASE a few years ago.&quot;andM;The WPMA, a consortium of Windows and Presentation Manager developers andcorporate users based in Richardson, Texas, is behind much of the effort toget Windows applications to work together better.andP;  The WPMA is currentlycirculating three proposed specifications among developers that should makeit easier for users to transport data among applications.andM;One of those specifications, called the Intelligent Snapshot Driver (ISD)specification, is co-sponsored by two successful Windows developers,Micrografx Inc. of Richardson, Texas and Samna Corp., based in Atlanta.andP;  Oncecomplete, the specification will help Windows graphics developers createlibraries of graphics code that other developers can incorporate into theirproducts.andM;The ISD spec will allow users of Samna's Ami word processor, for example, toimport and render designs created in Micrografx Designer from within Ami.andM;Currently, users must import graphic designs from various products into theirword-processing applications via their clipboards.andP;  That tactic often resultsin a faulty image, because clipboard formats vary among applications andcannot include all the rendering algorithms used by every Windows graphicsdeveloper, said Paul Grayson, chairman of Micrografx.andM;In an industry historically populated by entrepreneurial, lone-wolf softwarefirms, developer cooperation in creating application standards issignificant, Grayson said.andM;&quot;It is scary -- and unprecedented,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Windows developers areentering a phase where they're working together like never before.andP;  But whatwe're doing will result in a fundamental shift in the way people look atcomputers.&quot;andM;The application-level standards are only the beginning, said Viktor Grabner,Microsoft's OS/2 evangelist.andM;Aided by Aldus Corp., Microsoft is working on extensions to DDE that willallow users to establish permanent links between data in applications.andP;  Theextensions will also help users create compound documents encompassing text,graphics and other data, he said.andM;Applications developers will be the first to take advantage of the DDEextensions, which Microsoft will later incorporate into future versions ofWindows and Presentation Manager at a system level, Grabner explained.andP;  Oncedevelopers begin supporting the DDE spec, users will gain a moreobject-oriented approach to applications.andM;For example, a user will be able to create a compound document that includesdata from several applications.andP;  Each type of data will be linked to theapplication that created it, so if a user needs to modify a spreadsheetthat's embedded in a word-processing document, it's no problem.andP;  He or shecan click on the spreadsheet object with a mouse, and the spreadsheetapplication will pop up with the correct file already loaded.andM;This scenario falls short of capabilities already provided by Hewlett-PackardCo.'s NewWave for Windows environment, analysts said, because it does notinclude the idea of a system-based object-management module, a more efficientway of managing data links.andP;  Over the next few years, however, Microsoftplans to add such a facility, Grabner said.andM;&quot;What all this means is that the so-called 'mega app' is dead,&quot; concludedWPMA's Maloney.andP;  &quot;With these new specifications and enhancements, users willsoon be able to snap functions together quickly, using several applicationsor parts of applications.andP;  And that's what's going to differentiate Windowsfrom DOS and the Mac.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
