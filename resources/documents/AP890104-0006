The Red Brigades, a collection of far-left terrorist groups, usedkilling, kidnapping and ``knee-capping'' _ shooting someone in theknee _ to try to destroy confidence in the Italian state during the1970s and early 1980s.   The group has greatly diminished in size in recent years.   The Fighting Communist Party is a military wing of the RedBrigades and, according to the Italian news agency AGI, the New RedBrigades is a faction with about 100 members, most of them veryyoung.   De Luca is assistant director of Rome's Rebibbia prison, whichholds 1,300 people and includes a maximum-security section thatholds terrorists, among others. De Luca is responsible for a sectionwith people accused of common crimes, AGI said.   Employees of the prison in the past have been victims of RedBrigades attacks. De Luca's home was firebombed in 1980, when he wasemployed at the prisons office of the Justice Ministry, the Italiannews agency ANSA said. No one claimed responsibility for the attack.   The last Red Brigades killing was in April, when Sen. RobertoRuffilli was shot near his home in Forli in northern Italy.</TEXT></DOC>
