Energy-savingconcentration method was searched to replace a distillation method asa method of concentrating dilute alcohols, for which a reverse osmosismethod was proposed; experimental results have been reported accordingly.One result is that the osmotic pressure method has a limitation of difficultyto exceed more than 15% concentration. For this, the reverse osmosiswas reviewed and it was found that wider concentration range should beexamined for the area where the reverse osmosis was not experimented.Fils employed were a polyamide film of Nitto Denko Co. and an acrylonitrilefilm of sumitomo Chemical Co.. The result revealed that alcohol couldbe concentrated up to rather high concentration in alcohol-water system;even in a non-aqueous system, separation with high selective permeabilitywas possible by the proper selection of film materials.
