Amidst the many challenges we'll face, there will be risks.   But let me assure you, we'll find more than our share ofopportunities.   We and our allies are strong _ stronger, really, than at anypoint in postwar period, and more capable than ever of supportingthe cause of freedom.   There's an opportunity before us to shape a new world.   What is it that we want to see?   It is a growing community of democracies anchoring internationalpeace and stability, and a dynamic free market system generatingprosperity and progress on a global scale.   The economic foundation of this new era is the proven success ofthe free market, and nurturing that foundation are the valuesrooted in freedom and democracy.   Our country, America, was founded on these values, and they gaveus the confidence that flows from strength.   So let's be clear about one thing.   America looks forward to the challenge of an emerging globalmarket, but these values are not ours alone.   They are now shared by our friends and allies around the globe.   The economic rise of Europe and the nations of the Pacific rimis the growing success of our postwar policy.   This time is a time of tremendous opportunity, and destiny is inour own hands.   To reach the world we want to see, we've got to work, and workhard.   There's a lot of work ahead of us.   We must resolve international trade problems that threaten topit friends and allies against one another.   We must combat misguided notions of economic nationalism thatwill tell us to close off our economies to foreign competition justwhen the global marketplace has become a fact of life.   We must open the door to the nations of Eastern Europe and othersocialist countries that embrace free market reforms.   And finally, for developing nations heavily burdened with debt,we must provide assistance and encourage the market reforms thatwill set those nations on a path towards growth.   If we succeed, the next decade and the century beyond will be anera of unparalleled growth, an era which sees the flourishing offreedom, peace and prosperity around the world.   But this new era cannot unfold in a climate where conflict andturmoil exist, and therefore, our goals must also include securityand stability.   Security for fully _ security and stability.   Security _ this text is going crazy on this machine here _(laughter).   Security for ourselves and our allies and our friends, stabilityin the international arena, and in the end to regional conflicts.   Such goals are constant, but the strategy we employ to reachthem can and must change as the world changes.   Today the need for a dynamic and adaptable strategy isimperative.   We must be strong economically, diplomatically, and as you know,militarily, to take advantage of the opportunities open to us in aworld of rapid change.   And nowhere will the ultimate consequences of change have moresignificance for world security than within the Soviet Union itself.   What we're seeing now in the Soviet Union is indeed dramatic.   The process is still ongoing, unfinished.   But make no mistake, our policy is to seize every _ and I meanevery _ opportunity to build a better, more stable relationshipwith the Soviet Union, just as it is our policy to defend Americaninterests in light of the enduring reality of Soviet military power.   We want to see perestroika succeed, and we want to see thepolicies of glasnost and perestroika _ so far a revolution imposedfrom top down _ institutionalized within the Soviet Union.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
