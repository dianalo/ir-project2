The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the proceduresthat the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute funds obtained fromAmorient Petroleum Company, California. The funds are being held in aninterest-bearing account pending distribution by the DOE. The DOE has tentatively determined to distributre these funds in accordancewith the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning CrudeOil Cases, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Under the Modified Policy, crudeoil overcharges monies are divided among the state, the federal government,and injured purchasers of refined products. Under the plan we are proposing,refunds to the states would be distributed in proportion to each state'sconsumptiopn of petroleum products during the period of price controls.Refunds to eligible purchasers would be based on the number of gallonsof petroleum products which they purchased and the extent to which theycan demonstrate injury. Applications for refund should not be filed at this time. Appropriate publicnotice will be given when the submisson of claims is authorized. Any memberof the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refundprocedures. Commenting parties are requested to provide two copies of theirsubmissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publication ofthis notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and should be sent to the address set forth atthe beginning of this notice. All comments received in this proceedingwill be available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, in the Public ReferenceRoom of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E-234, 1000Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 17, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George B.

These procedures are used to refund monies to those injuredby actual or alleged violations of the DOE price regulations. The ERA has filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Proceduresfor funds obtained from Amorient Petroleum Company, California (Amorient)in the amount of $1,083,442 and remitted to the DOE pursuant to a July8, 1985 Consent Order between the firm and the DOE, Consent Order number940X00168Z. An additional $167,984 in interest has accrued on that amountas of August 31, 1988. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth theOHA's plan to distribute these funds. Comments are solicited. The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implementa plan to distribute refunds are set forth in 10 CFR Part 205, SubpartV. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannotreadily identify the persons who may have been injured as a result of actualor alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of therefund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of SubpartV and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds,see <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>9 DOE andpara;82,508 (1981), and <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>8 DOE andpara;82,597 (1981). We have consideredthe ERA's request to implement Subpart V procedures with respect to themoney received from Amorient and have determined that such procedures areappropriate. The Amorient Consent Order refers to the firm's sales of crude oil andrefined petroleum products during the period from August 19, 1973 throughJanuary 27, 1981. However, after reviewing the ERA audit file concerningAmorient's pricing practices, we find that it is likely that the firm soldonly crude oil during the Consent Order period.\1\<NOTE/> We therefore propose to distribute the Amorient consent orderfunds in accordance with the refund procedures established in other crudeoil proceedings. Before setting forth those procedures, we will first summarizethe background of the DOE crude oil refund process. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\This finding in no way represents a determination on anyof the factual or legal issues involved in the Amorient enforcement proceedingthat was settled by the Consent Order. Rather, it represents our determinationas to the most equitable and efficient method of treating the AmorientConsent Order funds for purposes of this Subpart V proceeding.I. BackgroundOn July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Modified Statement of RestitutionaryPolicy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 Fed. Reg. 27899 (August 4,1986) (``the MSRP''). The MSRP, issued as a result of a court-approvedSettlement Agreement in <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>M.D.L. No. 378 (D. Kan.), provides that crude oil overcharge fundswill be divided among the states, the federal government, and injured purchasersof refined petroleum products. Under the MSRP, up to 20 percent of thesecrude oil overcharge funds will be reserved initially to satisfy validclaims by injured purchasers of petroleum products. Eighty percent of thefunds, and any monies remaining after all valid claims are paid, are tobe disbursed equally to the states and federal government for indirectrestitution. The OHA has been applying the MSRP to all Subpart V proceedings involvingalleged crude oil violations. <T3>See </T3>Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 F.R. 29689 (August 20, 1986).That Order provided a period of 30 days for the filing of any objectionsto the application of the MSRP, and solicited comments concerning the appropriateprocedures to follow in processing refund applications in crude oil refundproceedings. On April 10, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous commentswhich it received in response to the August 1986 Order. 52 F.R. 11737 (theApril 1987 Notice). The Notice set forth generalized procedures and providedguidance to assist claimants that wish to file refund applications forcrude oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. All applicants for refundswould be required to document their purchase volumes of petroleum productsduring the period of Federal crude oil price controls and to prove thatthey were injured by the alleged overcharges. The Notice indicated thatend-users of petroleum products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleumindustry would be presumed to have absorbed the crude oil overcharges,and need not submit any further proof of injury to receive a refund. Finally,we stated that refunds would be calculated on the basis of a per gallonrefund amount derived by dividing crude oil violation amounts by the totalconsumption of petroleum products in the United States during the periodof price controls. The numerator would consist of crude oil overchargemonies that were in the DOE's escrow account at the time of the M.D.L.378, settlement, or were subsequently deposited in the escrow account,and a portion of the funds in the M.D.L. 378 escrow at the time of thesettlement. The DOE has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April1987 Notice, <T3>see, e.g., Shell Oil Co., </T3>17 DOE andpara;85,204 (1988) (<T3>Shell Oil</T3>), and <T3>Ernest A. Allerkamp, </T3>17 DOE andpara;85,079 (1988) (<T3>Allerkamp</T3>), and the procedures have been approved by the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Kansas. Various States had fileda Motion with that Court, claiming that the OHA violated the Stripper WellSettlement Agreement by employing presumptions of injury for end-usersand by improperly calculating the refund amount to be used in those proceedings.On August 17, 1987, the Court issued an Opinion and Order denying the States'Motion in its entirety. The Court concluded that the Settlement Agreement``does not bar OHA from permitting claimants to employ reasonable presumptionsin affirmatively demonstrating injury entitling them to a refund.'' <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>671 F. Supp. 1318, 1323 (D. Kan. 1987). The Court also ruled that,in calculating the per gallon volumetric refund amount, the OHA could utilizea portion of the M.D.L. 378 overcharge monies. The latter ruling was recentlyaffirmed by the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>3 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara;26,604 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1988).II. Proposed Refund Procedures <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Refund Claims </ITAG>We now propose to apply the procedures discussed in the April 1987 Noticeto the crude oil Subpart V proceeding that is the subject of the presentdetermination. As noted above, $1,083,442 in alleged crude oil violationamounts is covered by this Proposed Decision. We have decided to reserveinitially the full 20 percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts,or $216,688 plus interest for direct refunds to claimants, in order toensure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds to injured parties.The amount of the reserve may be adjusted downward later if circumstanceswarrant.   The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on allegedcrude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has usedin Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overchargesinvolving refined products. <T3>See Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,</T3> 14 DOE andpara; 85,475 (1986) (<T3>Mountain Fuel.)</T3> As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will berequired to document their purchase volumes and to prove that they wereinjured as a result of the alleged violations. Applicants who were end-usersor ultimate consumers of petroleum products, whose businesses are unrelatedto the petroleum products, whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleumindustry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are presumedto have absorbed rather than passed on alleged crude oil overcharges. Inorder to receive a refund, end-users need not submit any further evidenceof injury beyond volumes of product purchased during the period of crudeoil price controls. <T3>See A. Tarricone,</T3> 15 DOE andpara; 85,495 at 88,893-96 (1987). Resellerand retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury, and maynot rely on the presumptions of injury utilized in refund cases involvingrefined petroleum products. <T3>Id.</T3> They can, however, use econometric evidence of the type employedin the OHA Report to the District Court in the Stripper Well Litigation,6 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 90,507 (June 19, 1985). Applicants whoexecuted and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows establishedin the Settlement Agreement have waived their rights to apply for crudeoil refunds under Subpart V. <T3>See Boise Cascade Corp.,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,214 at 88,411, <T3>reconsideration denied,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,494 (1987); <T3>Sea-Land Service, Inc.,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,496 at 88,991 n.1 (1987).Refunds to eligible claimants who purchased refined petroleum productswill be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund amount derived bydividing the crude oil violation amount involved in this determination($1,083,442) by the total consumption of petroleum products in the UnitedStates during the period of price controls (2,020,997,335,000 gallons).<T3>See Mountain Fuel,</T3> 14 DOE at 88,868. This approach reflects thefact that crude oil overcharges were spread equally throughout the countryby the Entitlements Program.\2\<NOTE/> This yields a volumetric refund amount of $0.000000536 pergallon for the proceeding involved in this determination. We propose toadopt a deadline of October 31, 1989 for refund applications submittedpursuant to this Decision. <T3>See World Oil Corp.,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,658 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Department of Energy established the EntitlementsProgram to equalize access to the benefits of crude oil price controlsamong all domestic refiners and their downstream customers. To accomplishthis goal, refiners were required to make transfer payments amoung themselvesthrough the purchase and sale of ``entitlements.'' This balancing mechanismhad the effect of evenly disbursing overcharges resulting from crude oilmiscertifications throughout the domestic refining industry. <T3>See Amber Refining Inc.</T3>, 13 DOE andpara; 85,217 at 88,564 (1985).As we stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will berequired to submit only one application for crude oil overcharge funds.<T3>See Allerkamp,</T3> 17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previouslysubmitted a refund application in crude oil refund proceedings need notfile another application. A deadline of June 30, 1988 was established forall first stage crude oil refund proceedings implemented pursuant to theMSRP up to and including <T3>Shell Oil. See A. Tarricone, Inc.,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,681 (1987);<T3>Allerkamp,</T3> 17 DOE at 88,178; <T3>Shell Oil,</T3> 17 DOE at 88,408. Accordingly, any applicant that nowfiles a refund application will be eligible to receive a refund based onlyon the volumetric amounts approved subsequent to that date in the secondstage of disbursements. This volumetric refund amount will be increasedas additional crude oil violation amounts are received in the future. Applicantsmay be required to submit additional information to document their refundclaims for these future amounts. Notice of any additional amounts availablein the future will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Payments to the States and Federal Government </ITAG>Under the terms of the MSRP, we propose that the remaining 80 percent ofthe alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this Proposed Decision,or $866,754 plus interest, be disbursed in equal shares to the states andfederal government for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states willbe in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in each stateduring the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds whicheach state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper WellSettlement Agreement. These funds will be subject to the same limitationsand reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by thestates under the Settlement Agreement. Before taking the actions we have proposed in this Decision, we intendto publicize our proposal and solicit comments on it. Comments regardingthe tentative distribution process set forth in this Proposed Decisionand Order should be filed with the OHA within 30 days of its publicationin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> It is Therefore Ordered That: The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Amorient PetroleumCompany, California pursuant to the Consent Order executed July 8, 1985will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision. <ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-24670 Filed 10-24-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
