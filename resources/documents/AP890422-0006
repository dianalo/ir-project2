A White House source, who declined to be identified, said Fridaythat Bush's decision was ``expected to be some kind of mix of railgarrison MX and Midgetman, but the final mix is to be determined.''   The decision represents a setback for Defense Secretary DickCheney, who reportedly favored deploying only one mobile missile,the 10-warhead MX. Bush was supposed to make a final decision thisweekend and inform Cheney.   Cheney had urged Bush to remove the nation's 50 MX missiles fromtheir concrete silos and put them on railroad cars to be shuttledaround the country _ an option known as the rail garrison MX. Hereportedly wanted to cut off funding for the truck-mobile Midgetman.   The decision on the missiles was one of several that must bemade as Cheney tries to cut $10 billion from the Pentagon budget.   According to congressional and Pentagon sources, both Star Warsand the B-2 stealth bomber face the budget ax when Cheney announceshis choices at a congressional hearing on Tuesday.   Cheney plans to scale back work on the B-2, which at recentestimates of $500 million per plane is the most expensive aircraftin history, while cutting funding for Star Wars.   Details on the proposal for the B-2 were not immediatelyavailable, the sources, who requested anonymity, said Friday.   Star Wars, of the Strategic Defense Initiative, would be cut to$4.8 billion for the Department of Energy in fiscal 1990. FormerPresident Reagan, who made Star Wars his top priority, had askedfor $5.9 billion in fiscal 1990 and $7 billion in 1991, a sharpincrease from the $4.5 billion allocated for the program this year.   The total defense budget stands at $299.2 billion _ $10 billionless than the budget former President Reagan submitted in Januaryand in accordance with the cut agreed upon a week ago by the WhiteHouse and Congress.   The defense secretary discussed the shrinking military budget ata Pentagon meeting with the chairmen and ranking members of theSenate and House Armed Services Committees and the leaders of theHouse Appropriations defense subcommittee.   Cheney's plan calls for the elimination of funding for theMarine Corps' V-22 Osprey troop transport aircraft, retirement ofone of two aging aircraft carriers _ the Coral Sea or the Midway _when the Abraham Lincoln is commissioned in 1990.   Such a retirement would maintain the Navy carrier force at 14instead of the 15 sought by Reagan.   The defense secretary is also planning to shift 24 frigates toreserve status and cancel $1.4 billion procurement of the F-14DTomcat fighter jets. Cheney also retained Reagan's plan toeliminate funding for the last two submarines in the Los Angelesclass, SSN688, in favor of the newer class SSN21.   In addition, Cheney plans to mothball a handful of B-52s; delaythe Millstar program, an Air Force's communications satelliteprogram; and cancel the Army Helicopter Improvement Program. Reaganhad proposed spending $210 million in 1990 for Millstar and $299million for the AHIP.   Buys of the Blackhawk UH-60A would be reduced from 83 to 72 andpurchases of the F-15E would be reduced to zero. That program hadbeen earmarked for $1.7 billion in the fiscal 1990 budget.   Army force structure would be reduced by 5 percent with cuts inthe number of people employed at headquarters and in procurement.   Those attending the meeting with Cheney were Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee; John Warner ofVirginia, ranking Republican on the panel; Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,chairman of the House Armed Services Committee; Rep. Bill Dickinsonof Alabama, ranking Republican on the panel; Rep. John Murtha,D-Pa.; and Rep. Joseph McDade, R-Pa., the chairman and rankingmember of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee.</TEXT></DOC>
