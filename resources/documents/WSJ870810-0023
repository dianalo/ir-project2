KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABOR </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The International Association of Siderographers is probably the only international union in which every member knows every other member's first name.    But, then, there are only 11 members in the union -- seven in the U.S. and four in Canada. The Siderographers (pronounced sidder-OG-ruh-ferz) is the smallest of the 89 international unions in the AFL-CIO. And it is &quot;getting smaller all the time,&quot; says Francis Young, one of the U.S. seven.    Right now, the Lilliputian of labor is struggling to survive in a land of union giants and, at the same time, preserve the skill of siderography. The name comes from the Greek sideros, for iron, and graphy, for writing. &quot;We could be called Ironwriters,&quot; says Douglas Nesbitt, a member of the Washington local. He and other union members take the metal plates carved by engravers for currency, postage stamps, food coupons, stock certificates and the like and turn them into mass-volume printing plates or rolls.    But ironwriters -- and their union -- may soon be obsolete. Already, the union is so small that it could easily be omitted from labor statistics. Rounding off union membership totals to the nearest hundred, the membership &quot;should really be zero, but I plug them in at 100,&quot; says Leo Troy, a Rutgers University economics professor and a top expert on unions' membership.    Two years ago the Siderographers had nine members in the U.S. But then a member of the two-man New York local died, and management refused to negotiate with a one-person local. So the Siderographers gave the survivor to the Engravers Union.    The AFL-CIO pays the union scant attention. Supposedly, within the federation, &quot;I have the same clout as a union president with thousands of members,&quot; says Richard Warburton, the IAS president. But it is clear, he says, that the AFL-CIO regards the Siderographers as a nuisance and would like to merge it into a larger union. In fact, the federation may not even be paying that much attention. While an AFL-CIO official calls the Siderographers &quot;a delightful union,&quot; a federation spokesman says that &quot;merging the Siderographers is not a high priority of ours.&quot;    Technology changes (such as more durable chrome plates, plastic rolls and electrolytic plating), along with a decline in the frequency of currency-design changes, have reduced the need for siderographers. But the union argues that machines aren't any match for its members. Last month, when a missing press part at the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing fouled up printing of a new stamp honoring certified public accountants, four siderographers willingly went on 12-hour shifts to make up lost production. &quot;What would happen if you had a new currency design and no siderographers? You'd be out of luck,&quot; Mr. Warburton says.    Union members also maintain that they are the Treasury Department's first line of defense against counterfeiting. Their skills are hard to learn, they say, and the siderographic process is difficult and costly for counterfeiters to duplicate.    A siderographer takes engravings of the various elements of a bill -- such as the portrait, lettering, denomination numbers, serial number, seal and border -- and makes raised images of the pieces on small steel rolls using a heavy, hand-operated press. The rolls are then used to create an imprint of the entire bill on a blank steel plate. That in turn is used to make 32 plastic dies, which are welded together and used to produce a single large plate with 32 identical engravings.    The process began around 1800, when Jacob Perkins, a Massachusetts engraver and inventor, devised a way to retain delicate line effects while reproducing engravings on steel rolls. He named the process siderography. After May 1809, the Massachusetts legislature required that banks in the state use the process in issuing notes.    The popularity of siderography spread, and in 1899 a dozen workers in the Bureau of Engraving formed the Steel Plate Transferrers Association of America. In 1906 Samuel Gompers, the president of the American Federation of Labor, issued a national charter for the group and its 49 members.    The union was one of the few to start providing unemployment benefits to members before the government created a jobless-pay program, and it was the first international to reach 100% participation in U.S. savings-bond purchases in World War II. Its name was changed to the Siderographers union in 1921, and membership reached a peak of about 65 in the 1950s.    Now &quot;we're so few, we're an elite group,&quot; says Harvey Henderson, the union's secretary-treasurer. In addition to Washington, the U.S. members work in Philadelphia and Chicago, where they are employed by U.S. Bank Note Co. Technically, the three belong to the Washington local, but they negotiate as a separate local with their private employer.    Unlike most other union chiefs, Mr. Warburton, who also heads the Washington local, does union business after work or during his vacations. The union has cut its officer ranks from four to two, and the Siderographer chiefs get no pay for their union work.    Moreover, with very small size comes very small muscle in a current labor dispute. The four-man Washington local has been hit with government pay caps and other provisions that have left its members earning $9.44 an hour, or 28%, less than their colleagues at American Bank Note in New York.    Mr. Warburton contends that under the law, bureau siderographers' pay must be pegged to the American Bank Note scale. He also argues that if you know you are being paid less than your counterparts, &quot;you don't have your heart in your work all the time&quot; no matter how hard you try. &quot;I take pride in my work,&quot; he says, &quot;but I could take a hell of a lot more pride for another $18,000 a year.&quot; (A bureau spokesman says that the bureau has no choice but to follow the wage policy set by its parent, the Treasury Department.)    Federal employees can't strike, so the tiny union has gone to court to try to close the pay gap. But its war chest is more like a tin cup. Mr. Warburton has used his international-presidency mantle to take his local's case to the AFL-CIO, but officials there say they can't do much. Mr. Warburton says that Lane Kirkland, the AFL-CIO's president, told him, &quot;Wait till we get a new president&quot; in the White House.    Despite all its problems, though, the union still has one advantage over other unions. Its entire membership list will fit easily into one paragraph of a newspaper story: Messrs. Warburton, Henderson, Nesbitt and Young in Washington; Paul Gabe and Stephen Micklosh in Philadelphia; William Locher in Chicago; and James Bullis, Anthony St. Dennis, Richard Besserer and Kenneth Martin in Canada. </TEXT></DOC>
