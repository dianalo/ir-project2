DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan signed a multibillion-dollareducation measure expanding services to students Thursday, butexpressed regret that ``current Supreme Court jurisprudence'' ishostile to provisions outlawing pornographic telephone messages.   In a signing ceremony attended by the bill's sponsors andsupporters in Congress, Reagan said the measure ``reauthorizes andimproves a wide variety of federal programs at the elementary andsecondary school level.''   ``At the same time, it recognizes a fundamental truth: that theprimary responsibility for educating these children lies with thelocal communities and the states and not with the federalgovernment,'' he said.   Noting the ban on telephone pornography, the president said, ``Icommend Congress for joining the administration's long-standingeffort to combat hard core obscenity.''   ``I am bound to note, however, as much as it displeases me, thatcurrent Supreme Court jurisprudence is unfriendly to parts of thisbill,'' he said. ``And I hope that the courts and the Congress willwork with the administration to do as much as is permitted by theConstitution to enforce the provisions of this statute.''   The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the ban on telephonepornography, saying that, although born of concern for children, itintrudes on the privacy and free speech rights of American adults.   ``No court has ever upheld a complete ban on non-obscene,so-called `indecent' speech,'' Barry Lynn, legislative counsel tothe ACLU, said after Senate passage of the measure.   The signing ceremony was attended by Rep. Augustus Hawkins,D-Calif., and Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt., the principal sponsorsof the bill, and by Republicans and Democrats in both houses whojoined them in sponsorship.   The act authorizes up to $8.3 billion in spending next year onelementary and secondary school programs, with more than half themoney going to disadvantaged children at risk of failing.   It contains new programs to prevent dropouts and help highschool students with weak skills, and greatly expands drug abuseeducation and magnet schools. New money also was earmarked formath, science and foreign-language programs.   The bill, a compromise between the versions passed by the Houseand Senate, was approved by voice vote in the Senate and by a voteof 397-1 in the House, with Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ind., votingagainst it.   The largest single program in the measure will pay for tutoringand other services to disadvantaged children who are in danger offailing academically. School districts could receive basic grantstotaling up to $4.7 billion in the 12 months beginning Oct. 1, , a$400 million increase over current spending.   Other initiatives in the bill include $50 million for ``EvenStart,'' to jointly educate poor preschool children and theirilliterate parents; $50 million for dropout preventiondemonstration projects; and $200 million to improve basic skills ofhigh school students.   ``From the beginning, we worked with Congress, educators and thepublic to assure legislation that would assure basic education forAmerica's youth,'' Reagan said.</TEXT></DOC>
