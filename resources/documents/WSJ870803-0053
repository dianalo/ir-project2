Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations subcommittee, warned that &quot;every American who trains or fights with weapons supplied by the Department of Defense . . . may be endangered by phony bolts.&quot;    The committee said most of the problem bolts are brought to the U.S. from Japan, Taiwan and other countries by trading firms, some of which may be aware of their counterfeit nature.    There are no federal laws against importing such mismarked fasteners, but Stephen Sims, the panel's chief investigator, warned that any fastener vendor who deliberately cheats on specifications could be guilty of fraud.    Mr. Sims said the quality problem was so serious at Chicago-based FMC Corp.'s California defense unit that FMC &quot;ended up throwing out about $700,000 worth of bolts.&quot; The California unit makes the Bradley fighting vehicle and the M-113 personnel carrier.    FMC acknowledged that it was once stuck with a supply of counterfeit bolts. &quot;We were the first company to take action when we were alerted by the Army,&quot; an FMC spokesman said. &quot;We did find a number of mismarked bolts but we have eliminated the problem since Feb. 1.&quot;    Another Army supplier, BMY Corp., York, Pa., discovered that a third of its supply of Grade 8 bolts, a widely used type of fastener, was of a lower grade with less heat resistance, Mr. Sims reported. BMY makes the M-109 self-propelled howitzer and the M-88 tracked vehicle for the Army. BMY is a unit of Harsco Corp., Camp Hill, Pa. A Harsco official confirmed Mr. Sims's account of the discovery of substandard bolts by BMY. The official also said &quot;the problem has been resolved to the satisfaction of the government and the company.&quot;    The Army Tank Automotive Command, which oversees most of FMC's and BMY's deliveries, acknowledges that the wide distribution of these bolts is a &quot;serious problem.&quot; But it denies that Army soldiers are at risk in the cases cited by the committee.    The committee didn't attach blame to any of the defense contractors it mentioned in its report. &quot;These bolts get mixed up in bins with good ones, so the customer often doesn't know what he's getting,&quot; Mr. Sims said. The committee plans to introduce legislation to prevent further abuses of fastener standards.    The committee also reported that the Defense Industrial Supply Center, the Pentagon's Philadelphia-based purchaser of civilian products, unwittingly passed on counterfeit bolts to an air shuttle project at the Vandenberg air base in California. &quot;Fortunately, the bolts were installed on ground-support equipment, not on the shuttle itself,&quot; Mr. Sims said.    The panel said similar bolt-substitution problems occurred at GTE Corp.'s government systems unit in Mountain View, Calif.; Morton Thiokol Inc.'s Wasatch division in Brigham City, Utah; Emerson Electric Corp.'s electronics and space division in St. Louis, and Oshkosh Truck Corp., an Oshkosh, Wis., firm that makes the heavy-duty trailers that haul the Army's tactical nuclear missiles. </TEXT></DOC>
