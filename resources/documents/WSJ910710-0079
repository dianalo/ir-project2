But the data generated by thecensus not only determines the political clout states have inthe House of Representatives but is used to divvy up $45billion a year in federal spending. Stakes that high have ledsome big-city officials to demand that computer estimates beused to add in to the totals the five million people whocouldn't or didn't want to be counted by census takers.   A settlement of a court challenge to the 1980 censusrequires that Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher decide thisweek whether or not to accept the Census Bureau's head countor accept the use of statistical models to &quot;adjust&quot; thecensus data. The winners would be urban areas andimmigrant-rich states such as California and Arizona. But ifSecretary Mosbacher values the integrity of the census hewon't endanger it by endorsing the use of computerprojections that are subject to error and politicalmanipulation.</LP><TEXT>   While most experts agree on the size of the undercount,there is no consensus about whether it is possible toproperly assign the missing people to each of the fourmillion block units that serve as the basis for any analysisof the census. Any adjustment would be based on a survey of165,000 households the Census Bureau conducted to determinethe size of the undercount. But that survey involved lessthan 1% of the nation's 100 million households. Such a samplesimply isn't large enough for reliable projections for smallgeographical units. And since the survey used many of thesame techniques employed by the actual census, it probablymissed many of the same people who went uncounted in thefirst place.   This means that adjusting the census would be anything buta scientific exercise. Any attempt to massage the data wouldinvolve a number of highly subjective decisions. BernardGrofman, a professor who has served as a redistricting expertfor many Democrats, says he is skeptical about any censustampering because &quot;there are so many different ways to adjustthe numbers.&quot;   Whatever decision Secretary Mosbacher makes will becontested in the courts. The 1980 census spawned 52 lawsuits,some of which were settled only recently. Ironically, itturns out many of the states that sued to force an adjustment-- such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and New York -- will end uplosing if the adjusted data are used. No doubt some of themwould go to court to adjust the adjustment, setting off anever-ending cycle of suits and countersuits.   Every census since the time of George Washington has hadan undercount. The Census Bureau should continue to improveits ability to conduct an accurate count. But the use ofcomputers should be limited to counting actual people, notinventing them for the purpose of placating specialinterests. Playing statistical games with the census mightundermine its credibility to a degree that no computer wouldbe able to quantify.</TEXT></DOC>
