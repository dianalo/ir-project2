The justices said they will study a federal appeals court rulingthat struck down key provisions of the state law.   Even before today's action in the appeal filed by Missouriofficials, the case had become the most-watched battleground in thecontinuing political war over abortion. Justice Department lawyersalso are urging the high court to use the case as a means of undoingits 1973 ruling, called Roe vs. Wade.   But nothing in the brief order issued today suggested that thejustices will reconsider Roe vs. Wade.   The court's eventual decision, expected by July, could resolvethe Missouri controversy without significantly changing the 1973decision or other past rulings on abortion.   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last July 13 struck down,among other aspects of the Missouri abortion law, these fiveprovisions:   _A ban on using public hospitals or other government-runfacilities for abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing orassisting an abortion.   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''women to have abortions.   _A requirement that doctors planning to abort a fetus believed tobe older than 19 weeks test for weight and lung capacity todetermine whether the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb.   _A declaration that ``the life of each human being begins atconception.''   The appeals court upheld a provision in the state law that bansthe use of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion.But it said use of a public facility or the services of a publicemployee cannot be banned if all such costs are reimbursed by apatient.   In the apppeal acted on today, Missouri Attorney General WilliamL. Webster said the 8th Circuit court's ruling ``expands (SupremeCourt) precedents in favor of abortion on demand, further contractsthe state's compelling interest in the life of viable, unbornchildren and disregards this court's holdings that abortion is aprivate matter which government need in no way subsidize.''   The 1973 decision ``should itself be reconsidered'' if it cannotbe squared with the disputed Missouri law, Webster said.   William Bradford Reynolds, then chief of the Justice Department'scivil rights division, wrote to Missouri officials last summerurging them to include a challenge of Roe vs. Wade in the state'sappeal.   ``I felt this was the best case on the horizon to undertakereconsideration of Roe,'' Reynolds told The Wall Street Journal in arecent interview.   In a brief filed two days after the presidential election astNov. 8, Justice Department lawyers supported Missouri's appeal.   That sparked Molly Yard, president of the National Organizationfor Women, to accuse the Justice Department of ``declaring war onthe women of this country.''   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority,said there will be ``no honeymoon on the issue of abortion'' forPresident-elect Bush because of the Justice Department's involvementin the Missouri case.   In its 1973 ruling, the Supreme Court said women have aconstitutional right of abortion, based on the right of privacy. Thecourt most recently reaffirmed that ruling in 1983.   Today's court is viewed as deeply divided on the abortion issue.   Justice Harry A. Blackmun told a law school audience lastSeptember that the 1973 decision he authored could be overturned inthe court's 1988-89 term.   ``The next question is, `Will Roe vs. Wade go down the drain?' Ithink there's a very distinct possibility that it will _ this term.You can count the votes,'' he said.   While Blackmun and Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshalland John Paul Stevens have resisted attempts to reverse or greatlymodify the 1973 decision, anti-abortion forces are hoping some dayto attract five votes for such a result.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. Whitedissented from the 1973 ruling and several subsequent abortiondecisions.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in past decisions has questioned thecourt's reasoning in its 1973 decision.   Justice Antonin Scalia, who has not yet voted in an abortiondecision since being named to the high court by President Reagan in1986, is thought to favor overturning or curtailing Roe vs. Wade.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last Feb. 18,likewise has not voted in an abortion decision. His views onabortion and the Roe vs. Wade decision are not known in anysignificant detail.   In other action today, the court:   _ Agreed to decide whether Congress may outlaw all sexuallyexplicit telephone dial-up message services, dubbed ``dial-a-porn.''   The justices will judge, sometime by July, the validity of a 1988law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messages availablethrough dial-a-porn services.   _ Allowed criminal defendants to exclude potential jurors becauseof their race.   In a case involving a black man's murder by Ku Klux Klan members,rejected arguments by Alabama prosecutors _ supported by lawenforcement officials nationwide _ that defense lawyers unlawfullyare seeking to impanel an all-white jury in the Klan case.   _ Refused to review lawsuits seeking millions of dollars indamages in behalf of children with birth defects allegedly caused bythe anti-nausea drug Bendectin.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by more than 800families who sued Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the maker ofBendectin, in federal court in Ohio.   _ Let stand a contempt citation against a mother jailed sinceAugust 1987 for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of herdaughter, whom she says was sexually abused by the child's father.   The justices, without comment, let stand the contempt citationagainst Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a District of Columbia plastic surgeon.   _ Barred local governments from receiving $180 million in federalrevenue sharing funds withheld by the Reagan administration.   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the moneyproperly was withheld under budget cuts imposed by the so-calledGramm-Rudman Act.   _ Turned away arguments that judges violate free-speech rightswhen keeping secret the names of people selected as grand jurymembers.   The justices, without comment, let stand a Missouri judge'sdecision to bar public inspection of the names of grand jurors in adouble-murder investigation.   The abortion case is Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services,88-605.</TEXT></DOC>
