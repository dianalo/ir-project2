Technological solutionsto crossings with maintained and abandoned lower ripside headings thatuse closed arch and ring supports are described. Usefulness of such supportsreinforced by additional support with roof holding capacity of 700-800kN was confirmed by experience gained in mines of the Vorkutaugol' association.Solutions used in the Primorskugol' and Sakhalinugol' associations (USSR)are outlined. Examples of protective end sections of longwalls and cavernswith individual and powered supports in the Knurow and Szczyglowa minesare presented. Concludes that closed ring support can be used for ripsideheadings in very difficult mining conditions. Crossings can be executedeither with reconstruction of the ripside working in front of a longwallfrom ring support to rectangular support and abandoning it at the cavingline, or by reinforcing the basic support at the crossing, removing sidewallarches and abandoning the ripside workings at the caving line. 9 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
