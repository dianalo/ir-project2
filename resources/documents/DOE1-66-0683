For their part, American allies have laid somewhat more emphasison the political, if not the security, aspects of multilateral arms control.This chapter looks both at the broad global forums, such as those underUN auspices, and at the more restricted multilateral gatherings, suchas the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction (MBFR) talks in Vienna orthe military aspects of the Conference on Security and Cooperation inEurope (CSCE) which have, from time to time at least, been more centralto American foreign policy and to US relations with allies.</TEXT></DOC>
