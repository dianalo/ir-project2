Brimming oil inventories, combined with some slowing in the growth of petroleum demand, are moving many oil-company planners and analysts to cut their near-term price projections. Although few expect a price collapse similar to the 50% drop of early 1986, oil economists and analysts generally expect a slide of as much as $3 by the spring, from the current price of $18 a barrel.    But despite an erosion of discipline in recent months in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, these planners and analysts generally believe that a break in oil prices will galvanize the cartel into reasserting its loosened grip on oil production. If so, the oil-price drop should be short-lived. Indeed, most oil experts project that for all next year, prices should average around the current $18 a barrel if OPEC reduces output, now estimated to total about 18.5 million barrels a day.    &quot;The $18 price is sustainable at OPEC production of 17 million barrels a day or less,&quot; says John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.    Even so, that would postpone by at least a year the $2-a-barrel increase in oil prices that, only a few months ago, had been widely predicted for the beginning of 1988. And none of these assumptions takes into account a world recession, which would, of course, drive prices down even more sharply, and cause them to stay down. Nor, however, do the forecasts take account of a major interruption of oil shipments through the volatile Persian Gulf, which would cause prices to escalate.    Above all, the future course of oil prices depends on the highly unpredictable actions of OPEC, whose members are gathering in Vienna Dec. 9.    Despite weakening petroleum markets, there's still an outside chance that the oil ministers might elect to boost the 1988 OPEC benchmark price by $1 or $2 a barrel to $19 or $20. They might even make it stick if they coupled it with severe production cuts similar to those made by OPEC at the beginning of this year. War-torn Iran, known to be discounting its oil prices at the moment by as much as $2 a barrel to spur sales, is, ironically, leading the faction in OPEC pushing for an oil-price increase.    But few in OPEC have shown the will or even the desire to slash production sufficiently to support such a price increase. And Saudi Arabia refuses to return to its former role of &quot;swing&quot; producer, when it alone reduced output as demand for OPEC oil fell.    As a result, the more likely conclusion of the December meeting will be what Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and some others want: continuing the $18 benchmark through next year and, perhaps, defending that price through strict enforcement of production quotas. Keeping production under control may require OPEC to increase its production ceiling to 17.5 million barrels a day from the current 16.6 million. A higher ceiling could help accommodate Iraq, which refuses to limit output unless it is given the same quota as its war foe, Iran.    But even if OPEC members quit cheating on their quotas and actually reduced production by one million barrels a day, industry officials estimate output still would be much too high in the initial months of 1988, given the deterioration in oil markets. Although the demand for OPEC oil is expected to average between 17.4 million and 18 million barrels a day for the entire year, much less is said to be needed in the first six months.    Although the outlook for the oil markets is similar to that of a year ago, one notable difference is OPEC's behavior. Early this year, OPEC was a model of discipline, adhering to the official price and production ceiling, which totaled 15.8 million barrels a day during the first half of the year. That gave oil companies leeway to work off a big backlog of stored oil without depressing prices.    Now, the inventory &quot;overhang&quot; is back, casting a far longer shadow over prices. Oil companies have built above-ground stocks to near-record levels again, the result of panic buying during the summer, when refiners grew concerned about a potential cutoff of Persian Gulf supplies. At one major oil company, an economist notes that the industry began 1987 with the equivalent of 15 days' supply of stock available for immediate use. Normally, the industry considers operating inventories burdensome if they exceed 10 or 11 days' supply. By the beginning of next year, the economist says, usable inventories will be &quot;even more uncomfortable&quot; -- as much as a 16-day supply.    Energy Security Analysis, a Washington-based firm that tracks world oil inventories, estimates total above-ground stocks of crude oil and petroleum products at 3.6 billion barrels, level with those of a year ago. But that doesn't include the huge amounts of oil believed to be aboard tankers still at sea -- the hangover from the floodgate days of this autumn, when OPEC was pouring out 19 million to 20 million barrels a day. &quot;A lot is afloat,&quot; says Sarah Emerson, Energy Security's market analyst.    Non-OPEC oil production, meanwhile, isn't falling as expected, although it has flattened. Despite the continuing decline in U.S. oil output, total non-OPEC production is expected to show gains for both 1987 and 1988, though at lesser rates of growth than in the past.    Rising world oil demand had been expected to absorb such gains. But in the wake of October's stock market crash, a new round of forecast revisions are under way among many oil economists. A number are reducing by one-half their previous projections for increases in demand this coming year. Some, such as the oil analysts at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., expect oil demand in 1988 actually to decline slightly from the 1987 level. On top of that, a Dean Witter report asserts that a global recession could slash oil demand by one million barrels a day or more.    Even without a recession, Joel Fischer, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. vice president and petroleum economist, looks for petroleum demand world-wide to rise only 300,000 barrels a day next year, or about 0.6%, to 47.6 million barrels a day, after increasing 700,000 barrels a day, or 1.5%, in 1987. Ted Eck, chief economist of Amoco Corp., is more optimistic on the demand outlook and foresees a 2% gain in 1988. Even so, he expects the price of oil to average $18.50 barrel for the year, and he says there's &quot;a good chance there will be another OPEC meeting&quot; in the spring to reduce production.    Some analysts who aren't lowering their demand forecasts for 1988 are, nonetheless, lowering their estimates of petroleum prices. Among them is Paul Mlotok, international oil analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., who now assumes the price for OPEC oil will be flat at $18 a barrel for the year, if the oil exporters hold production under 17 million barrels a day for the first half.    &quot;If they don't cut below that,&quot; he says, &quot;they'll get a quick reminder of what 1986 looked like,&quot; when oil prices collapsed.    ---                    The Need for OPEC Oil                (In millions of barrels a day)                                            DEMAND                     WORLD     NON-OPEC        FOR         YEAR       DEMAND      SUPPLY     OPEC OIL         1980        49.7        22.8       26.6         1981        47.7        23.5       22.4         1982        46.0        25.1       18.6         1983        45.2        26.2       17.2         1984        46.1        27.7       17.1         1985        45.7        28.0       15.9         1986        46.6        28.1       18.0         1987*       47.1        28.4       17.5         1988*       47.6        28.3       17.8   NOTE: World demand figures reflect inventory additions andwithdrawals and consumption of natural-gas liquids producedby OPEC.   *Estimate   Source: Salomon Brothers Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
