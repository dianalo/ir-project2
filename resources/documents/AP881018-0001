The queen, in Spain on a five-day visit, told a joint session ofparliament that Britain and Spain would play important roles in thefuture development of Europe. She praised Spain for 10 years ofdemocracy following nearly four decades under the authoritarianregime of Gen. Francisco Franco.   In her speech, which received a standing ovation, Elizabeth didnot mention the British colony of Gibraltar, the only majorpolitical dispute between the two countries.   On Monday night, both the British monarch and her third cousinand Spanish host, King Juan Carlos, said they believed the twocountries would eventually resolve their differences over thecolony that guards the Atlantic entrance to the Mediterranean Sea.   Spain seeks sovereignty over Gibraltar, which it ceded toBritain by treaty in 1713 after losing the War of SpanishSuccession. Britain has said Gibraltar will remain British unlessits 30,000 inhabitants decide otherwise.   Earlier Tuesday a small but enthusiastic crowd waving Britishand Spanish flags applauded as the queen and her husband, the Dukeof Edinburgh, placed a laurel wreath at a memorial to ``those whogave their lives for Spain.''   Elizabeth then went to City Hall to accept the keys to Madridfrom Mayor Juan Barranco.   The visit brought normally heavy traffic in Madrid to astandstill as police blocked off streets along the motorcade'sroute.   The queen's visit is to include trips to Barcelona, Seville andEl Escorial, a palace built in the foothills of the GuadarramaMountains north of Madrid by King Phillip II.   The royal couple were also to spend two days on a private visitwith Juan Carlos and Sofia on the Mediterranean island of Majorca.</TEXT></DOC>
