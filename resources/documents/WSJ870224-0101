Douglas Syp says he will never again write a memo mentioning crab claws.    Mr. Syp is assistant vice president of Suburban General Hospital in Norristown, Pa., and his Feb. 10 memo to the staff began: &quot;On Wednesday January 27th, twelve (12) crab claws were taken from the Weaver Conference room during the set-up for a luncheon. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE!&quot; To make the point, the last five words were also underlined.    Continuing, Mr. Syp warned that action would be taken against anyone taking food or beverage. &quot;This includes any leftovers!&quot; he admonished.    Mr. Syp was serious, but for hospital employees the fun was just beginning. Notices started dotting bulletin boards.    &quot;Crab claw ransom note,&quot; read one, using the classic ransom-note style of varying cut-out letters. &quot;Please be advised that these critters were not stolen they were taken hostage and are being held in Lebanon.&quot; The instructions: &quot;Don't contact the police or you may never see your crabs alive again. Leave almost $14.62 in mixed coins in the hospital store room.&quot;    The &quot;Save the Crab Claw Foundation&quot; beseeched passersby for a small donation to save the claws. &quot;They ask for so little, yet we owe them sooo much.&quot; Volunteers were sought for a secret mission to try to free the &quot;(12) twelve innocent, non-politically motivated crab claws. We are sure that all twelve (12) are afraid and feel abandoned by this shell shocking event.&quot;    In another notice, all employees were ordered to report &quot;for urine and stool testing for crabmeat.&quot; And a memo purportedly from the FBI warned hospital personnel that &quot;all trash cans are under survelance (sic) for the theft of leftovers.&quot;    Alas, the prank lasted only a few days. &quot;When I first saw them I found them amusing; they were cute, clever,&quot; Mr. Syp explains. &quot;By the middle of the second day I got bored -- maybe irritated is the right word; people lost the point that somebody was stealing something. And the third day I had them all ripped down.&quot;    What really infuriated him, he says, was that the crab claws were stolen just before a luncheon promoting the hospital.    &quot;Luckily we had more crab claws,&quot; says Mr. Syp. Lucky indeed, because otherwise the visitors would have been served regular hospital food. But Mr. Syp says he's heard all those jokes. </TEXT></DOC>
