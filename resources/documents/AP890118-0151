ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lee Atwater, the tough political operator whomanaged George Bush's presidential campaign, was elected RepublicanParty chairman today and he took office with a call for the GOP to``reach into communities where the Republican message has not yetfound a home.''   As Bush's choice to run the party, the 37-year-old SouthCarolinian was elected chairman without opposition for a two-yearterm.   He succeeded Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who served as chairman ofthe Republican National Committee for six years, the longest tenurein this century.   In his speech to the committee, Atwater described the GOPvictories in the last three presidential elections as ``the triumphof an idea. We are heirs to a political movement that offers newhope to millions of Americans.''   The new party chairman said Bush's victory over Democrat MichaelDukakis was ``because we have better ideas and we had the bestcandidate.''   But he also said the party now must strive to control theredistricting process under which legislative districts, at thestate and federal levels, will be redrawn in 1991 to conform topopulation shifts determined by the 1990 census.   Atwater said the Republicans also must work to attractminorities, to ``reach into communities where the Republican messagehas not yet found a home.''   ``We have been fighting with one arm tied behind our back _because the Democrats have succeeded in virtually cornering thevotes of whole segments of American society,'' he said, citingblacks, Hispanics, Asians and the disabled.   ``Our program of low taxes and economic growth, of standards inschools and safer streets, has a great appeal to Americans of allcolors and backgrounds,'' he said.   Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle appeared briefly at aRepublican committee luncheon and the president-elect endorsedAtwater's outreach program.   ``I like the concept that our party needs to have a broader base,a stronger participation,'' he said.   Bush said Atwater ``will be my political eyes and ears. ... I'mhere to say I want to work with the party.''   As he left office, Fahrenkopf also emphasized the need to controlthe redistricting process and pointed out that in the 1988 election,98 percent of House members who sought re-election were victorious.   He asked, ``Why is it that today there is more change in theSupreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. than there is in the American Houseof Representatives?''   Fahrenkopf said according to the State Department, the SupremeSoviet recently returned 96.1 percent of its members.   When Bush designated Atwater as his choice to head the committee,he said, ``He's a friend. I'm proud of his accomplishments.''   Political rivals claim Atwater's accomplishments often aretainted by roughhouse tactics.   ``He's got a tough-guy image,'' said South Carolina GOP chairmanVan Hipp. ``I think Lee enjoys it to be honest with you.''   For most of the 165 Republican committee members, the meeting wasa routine piece of business leading up to the inauguration of Bushon Friday and the round of parties keyed to that event.   In recent interviews, Atwater said a top priority would be tryingto expand the party's appeal to blacks, Hispanics, Asians and thehandicapped.   While getting 53 percent of the overall vote in the 1988 electionand carrying 40 states, Bush received only 12 percent of the blackvote, according to a New York Times-CBS poll. That was marginallybetter than Reagan who attracted the votes of 11 percent of blacksin 1980 and nine percent in 1984.   Among Hispanics, the Bush total was estimated at about 30percent, down from Reagan's totals of 35 percent in 1980 and 37percent in 1984.   Atwater paid tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. recently as ``anAmerican hero.'' The incoming GOP chairman was Bush's representativeat ceremonies marking King's birthday at the Ebenezer Baptist Churchin Atlanta where the late civil rights leader was pastor.   Bush used similar language when he spoke at a prayer breakfastMonday, the national holiday marking King's birth.   The president-elect said King ``lived a hero's life. He dreamed ahero's imagination of a great nation.''   A private panel called the Citizens Commission on Civil Rightsissued a report Tuesday that criticized the Reagan administrationfor ``a complete breakdown'' of endorsement of civil rights laws.   Chairman Arthur Flemming said the group was sending its report toBush ``in the hope that he can turn around the '80s as far as civilrights enforcement is concerned.''</TEXT></DOC>
