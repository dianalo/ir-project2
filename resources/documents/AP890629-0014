(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's 8:30 a.m. at Camp Solidarity and theUnited Mine Workers' version of the snake dance is about to beginalong narrow coal hauling roads in southwestern Virginia.   Several hundred Appalachian and Midwestern miners who left theirjobs in sympathetic wildcat strikes have lined up their cars andtrucks in a daily convoy they use to slow coal traffic.   Most of the miners involved in the walkouts, officiallyunauthorized by the union, stay in tents and campers at a 10-acrecampground leased by the union. Others stay in hotels nearby.   Nearly every working day since June 19, they've driven a fewmiles along a dirt road following the path of the Clinch River toPittston Coal Group's main processing plant in Russell County.There, they link up with miners on strike against Pittston in acontract dispute.   The vehicles slowly parade bumper-to-bumper for a few miles, turnaround, pass the entrance again, meander for another few miles andturn around again. A similar, smaller convoy is run along a roadconnecting Pittston mines with its other processing plant in McClure.   Coal trucks occasionally slip into the convoys and into theprocessing plants, but far fewer than normal.   State police say there is little they can do when drivers do notgo too slow and obey traffic laws. Troopers watch the passing paradeof cars and occassionally issue tickets for impeding traffic.   Strike captain Bill Bise of Lebanon stands at the entrance toPittston's main processing plant and marks down the number of trucksthat make it through the union gauntlet. ``How many loads we got?''``What's the count now?'' miners riding shotgun in convoy carsperiodically ask Bise as they drove slowly by.   At day's end, the wildcat strikers head back to the campgroundfor a hearty buffet.   ``It's a humongous pot luck supper,'' explains Joyce Kiser ofCastlewood, the wife of a retired miner, as she helps dish out fooddonated by area families and businesses supporting the strike.   After the meal, the campers play horseshoes, whittle and talkabout the union or listen to local musicians fill the hollow withbluegrass or gospel tunes.   The next morning, after a breakfast of eggs, bacon and potatoescooked on a huge makeshift grill, the convoy forms again.   People coordinating the activity said the wildcat strikers fromWest Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee andMissouri will be rotated in weekly and bi-weekly shifts indefinitely.   ``We'll stay as long as it takes,'' said Tim Evans, who is onstrike from Belva Coal Co., a Pittston mine near Logan, W.Va.   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Glen Williams tried to put afinancial roadblock in the way of the miners. He fined the union andtwo officers $240,000 for organizing the convoys. And he promised tolevy fines totaling $120,000 for each day the convoys continue.   On Tuesday, a federal judge in West Virginia ruled that thenearly 43,000 coal miners on wildcat strikes in nine states areviolating U.S. labor law and ordered them to return to work.   But the wildcat strikers said they have a permanent stake in whathappens to the 1,900 union members on strike against Pittston.   Pittston broke away from an association of coal companies thatsigned a national contract with the UMW last year, and minersbelieve that if the union loses its dispute with Pittston theircompanies may follow suit and lower their benefits, pensions and jobsecurity.   ``If everybody else does what Pittston is doing, we're all up acreek,'' Evans said.   He sleeps on a plastic sheet on the ground in a tent with a dozenother men. It's been raining almost every day and mud is up to hisankles in some parts of the campground.   But the 28-year-old equipment operator is almost gleeful.   ``If Pittston thinks that this is eventually going to wear usdown, they better think again,'' Evans said. ``When you're from theWest Virginia mountains, you get used to roughing it, staying in thewoods. They've got a saying about it: `A country boy can survive.'We're in our element.''</TEXT></DOC>
