Normally, Democrats go out of their way looking for a fight. Usually, they have managed to find one -- or two, or more. They'll fight over almost anything -- civil rights, the war in Vietnam, and if there's nothing better, an obscure challenge to party rules.    But there haven't been any great battles in Atlanta. No one's credentials were challenged. The rules emerged unscathed. The Rev. Jesse Jackson submitted three minority platform planks, but he pulled one before the vote and he lost gracefully on the other two.    Speaker after speaker steps to the podium and stresses &quot;family values.&quot; The band swings, again and again, into Sousa marches and patriotic airs. A stranger in these parts might be excused for thinking he'd wandered into a Republican convention.    Democrats are not only contentious; lately, in presidential elections, they've been losers. There may be a connection.    Now, at last, they smell victory.    They have a dependable, if not very exciting, ticket; they have a bobtailed platform that says almost nothing controversial; they are rolling in campaign cash.    And, as an opponent, they have George Bush, a gentleman of the old school who seems to send them into gales of helpless laughter. Texas state treasurer Ann Richards, in her keynote speech, said Mr. Bush was born &quot;with a silver foot in his mouth.&quot; That's the kind of jibe that may finally rank with Roosevelt cabinet member Harold Ickes' description of GOP presidential candidate Wendell Willkie as &quot;the barefoot boy from Wall Street.&quot;    Democratic incumbents feel good, for they know that the ticket will be strong enough to keep almost all of them gainfully employed.    Lobbyists feel good, for they know they'll be dealing with the same people in Congress next January. Organized labor feels so good it's hardly visible in Atlanta, figuring its high profile last time may have been counterproductive.    And so, night after night, members of Congress, lobbyists, union officials and delegates jam Flamingo Joe's nightclub, dancing the night away, while corporate America, at $20,000 a pop, picks up the tab on behalf of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.    For big business, sensing something in the air, is here too.    US Sprint threw a Mexican theme party for House Majority Whip Tony Coehlo. Not to be outdone, Pacific Telesis Group tossed a party at a steak house for Mr. Coehlo the next day.    Union Pacific Corp. has rolled two club cars into town to entertain Democrats. The company is headed by Drew Lewis, frequently a troubleshooter for the Republicans. The National Association of Realtors is throwing several parties, and proudly boasts that 89 of its members are delegates or alternates to this convention.    Others lining up to entertain the Democrats: Allied Signal Corp., Grumman Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co., Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp., E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. and Smith, Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    The American Medical Association, which sponsored a filet-mignon luncheon at the sumptuous Ritz-Carlton Hotel, counts more than 30 doctors (or their spouses) as delegates. That's a three-fold increase since the last convention, the AMA points out. </TEXT></DOC>
