The overall objective of this study is to develop cost-effectivemethods of establishing and maintaining a vegetative cover that is inharmony with adjacent undisturbed areas. An initial erosion control coverwas established with introduced grasses and legumes. Container and bareroot conifer seedlings and cuttings of deciduous species were utilizedinitially to establish tress and shrubs in the area. Results indicatethat a significantly higher survival rate was achieved for trees plantedin areas where a grass and legume cover was present as compared to areaswhere no cover was present. Survival rate was higher for container thanfor bare root seedlings. Shrub cuttings rooted prior to planting hadhigher survival and growth rates than direct planted cuttings. Long termresults indicate that trees and shrubs will become established in significantnumbers by natural processes. Direct seeding has also proven to be aviable method for establishment of trees and shrubs in the area. Resultsobtained from the research program to date indicate that there are anumber of methods that exist for the establishment of trees and shrubson mined land. The method or combination of methods utilized is dependentupon end land use desired, time frame allowed and specific site conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
