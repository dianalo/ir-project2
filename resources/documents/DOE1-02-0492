Extensiveleasing and exploration by Phillips and Gulf led to the discovery ofa high-temperature (over 400{sup 0}F) reservoir in 1979. Geothermal DevelopmentAssociates obtained a geothermal resources lease on a 30-acre parceland a 10-year power sales agreement for 5 MW from the local utility,Sierra Pacific Power Company, in late 1983. Drilling commenced in March1985, modular power plant construction began in October, and initialplant startup with power to the grid was accomplished in December 1985.Owing to cooling-water access and treatment costs, air-cooled condensersreplaced the planned cooling towers, and full-time scale continuous productionat rated capacity did not begin until late 1986. Three production wellsand two injection wells, completed in highly fractured Cretaceous granodioriteand Tertiary andesite at depths of less than 1000 ft, produce 340{sup0}F water having a salinity of 2300 ppm. Production well line-shaft pumpsdeliver in excess of 3000 gpm water to seven 1.2 MW-Rankine cycle binarypower plant modules. The heat extracted from the geothermal water vaporizesthe low boiling point N-pentane working fluid that expands to drive theturbines. The geothermal water is injected back into the reservoir. Boththe pentane and the geothermal water are in separate closed-loop systems,which provides for an environmentally clean operation in this sensitive,highly visible site on the periphery of a metropolitan area.</TEXT></DOC>
