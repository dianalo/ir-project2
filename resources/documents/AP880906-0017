The wife of presidential press secretary James Brady said shereminded Reagan in a telephone conversation that John W. HinckleyJr. shot him and Brady in March 1981 with a gun purchased in astate _ Texas _ without a waiting period.   Mrs. Brady said Reagan endorsed the concept of a federal waitingperiod, but not the specific language in a comprehensive anti-drugbill that the House will consider this week _ and likely pass.   ``He recognized the need for federal legislation,'' Mrs. Bradysaid, after she told him that states ``are not doing the job'' instopping drug dealers from obtaining handguns.   Debate on the overall drug bill begins Wednesday, and a finalvote could take place Friday. The Senate will then follow with itsown drug bill and the two versions would eventually be merged intofinal legislation.   The House bill as introduced would carry a $1.5 billion to $2billion annual price tag, money that would be added to the $3.9billion a year the federal government is now spending to fight druguse.   The legislation includes something for everyone involved infighting illegal drugs: more money for education, treatment andrehabilitation; more resources for state and local law enforcementefforts to seize drugs on land, in the air and on the seas.   Strict controls would be placed for the first time on thechemicals used as raw materials in the manufacture of heroin andcocaine.   There will be controversies over Republican-inspired amendmentsfor a federal death penalty against those who kill during a drugcrime; a ``good faith'' exception that would allow use of illegallyseized drug evidence in court, and denial of many federal benefitsfor convicted drug users.   The gun language would require a seven-day wait in the purchaseof a handgun from a licensed dealer.   The dealer must send law enforcement authorities a swornstatement that includes a description of the gun, the serialnumber, the name, address and birth date of the buyer.   Police may, but are not required, to conduct a background check.   Purchasers who would be denied the pistol would be those alreadyineligible under existing federal law: convicted felons, fugitivesfrom justice, illegal aliens, drug addicts, those adjudicatedmentally ill or committed to a mental institution, thosedishonorably discharged from the military and people underindictment for a felony.   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said he will offer an amendment tosubstitute a requirement that the Justice Department establish acomputerized system to identify felons trying to purchase handguns.Access would be provided to local police and firearms dealers.   ``I don't think you should have a waiting period when itabridges the right to buy a gun'' for a law-abiding citizen,McCollum said.   Reagan first weighed in on the subject of waiting periods onJune 21. The former California governor spoke favorably ofCalifornia's 15-day waiting period with a mandatory backgroundcheck, and added, ``Now, I would like to see that generally. Ithink that all states ought to take a look at that system.''   Mrs. Brady, who became a gun-control activist after herhusband's shooting, said she wrote Reagan thanking him for theremarks, and he called her a week later. She brought up the federalwaiting period during the conversation.   ``He wished it could be handled by the states,'' she said, butadded that Reagan was willing to have a federal law ``because ofthe overwhelming problem'' of drug dealers and other criminalsobtaining guns.   ``I told him we were trying to get that attached to the drugbill,'' Mrs. Brady said. ``I told him there is overwhelmingevidence through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms thatguns used in crimes are traced back to states where there is nowaiting period. I indicated Hinckley's gun came from a state,Texas, where there is no waiting period.''   Other key provisions of the drug bill would:   _Require states to automatically ``pass through'' anti-drugmoney to local governments.   _Revise banking laws to allow the government to closely watchinstitutions where drug money might be laundered.   _Require recipients of federal grants or contracts to maintain adrug-free workplace.   _Provide money for drug education, treatment and rehabilitationfor AIDS victims and groups with a high risk of getting the disease.   _Authorize $10 million for a Latin American regional anti-drugforce if one is approved by the Organization of American States.</TEXT></DOC>
