Since many observed failures of buriedpipes are attributable to pullout or crushing at joints and breaks alongthe pipeline itself, the present model is proposed to estimate the maximumrelative joint displacement and the maximum structural strain, undervarious soil conditions and material properties. Outcomes from both thequasi-static approach and dynamic analysis are compared, to examine theeffect of inertia and damping, which are generally neglected in dealingwith such a structure. The effect of excitation frequency, joint stiffness,pipe size, and pipe length on structural response is studied. Numericalresults may serve as a guide for design, as well as for reliability analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
