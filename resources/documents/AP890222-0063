The categories of rap and heavy metal were added to the 76divisions of awards for the CBS-TV show, the 31st edition of theGrammys. The show is hosted by Billy Crystal and produced by PierreCossette.   Folksinger Tracy Chapman and vocal gymnast Bobby McFerrin leadthe nominees. If Miss Chapman sweeps in her six nominatedcategories, she will be the first artist to win six trophies in onenight since Roger Miller did it in 1966 for his single ``King of theRoad.''   Fifteen of the awards are being televised, including the hardrock and heavy metal for which the group Metallica is a nomineealong with Iggy Pop, Jane's Addiction, Jethro Tull and AC@DC.   There will be a rap performance by Kool Moe Dee, but that awardcategory will be called during the usually fast-paced pre-televisedceremony in which most of the awards are given.   Rappers say it's an insult, and at least two nominated duos,Salt-N-Pepa and DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince, plan to boycottthe show.   Among other musicians slated to perform are Whitney Houston, theManhattan Transfer, Luther Vandross, Kool Moe Dee, Sinead O'Connor,Linda Ronstadt, Melissa Etheridge, Toni Childs, Tracy Chapman andItzhak Perlman.   Special tributes also were set for jazz, country and western andgospel music.   Metallica is set to perform their new single ``One,'' from thenominated album ``...And Justice For All.'' The group is popularwith heavy metal fans, but the band's uncompromising lyrics havekept it from the wider radio airplay enjoyed by hard rock groupslike Bon Jovi.   No one was more surprised than Metallica members to learn theyhad been asked to perform, one member said.   ``We've been very stubborn to make sure things would be done ourway and that we wouldn't have to give up creative control,''Metallica member Lars Ulrich told The Associated Press.   ``It's great we have been able to take this attitude all the wayto performing live on the Grammys and to be nominated, knowing it'sall being done on our terms,'' he said.   For the top nominees, Miss Chapman was named in the best song,record and female pop performance categories for ``Fast Car.'' Shealso was nominated for best new artist, and her self-titled albumwas nominated for the year's best LP and best contemporary folkperformance.   McFerrin, already a Grammy veteran with five awards, hadnominations for best song, record and pop male vocal for ``Don'tWorry, Be Happy,'' his No. 1 single. McFerrin, who uses noinstrument except his own voice and body, also was nominated forbest male jazz vocal performance for the song ``Brothers'' and abest album nomination for ``Simple Pleasures.''   Another contender for top awards was singer Anita Baker with fournominations for her one eligible song, ``Giving You The Best That IGot,'' which competed with Miss Chapman and McFerrin in the recordand song categories. The tune also received best female rhythm andblues performance and best overall rhythm and blues song performance.</TEXT></DOC>
