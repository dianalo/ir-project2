In a statement, the panel, which governs takeover activity in Britain, said it made the change to eliminate any uncertainty about its stance in light of the recent stock-market crash.    The panel's existing rule stated only that &quot;when an offer is reasonably in contemplation,&quot; if a potential offerer acquires shares in the target company, any subsequent takeover bid made by the offerer &quot;shall not be on less favorable terms.&quot; The panel said the existing wording could cause uncertainty, especially considering the recent sharp drop in share prices.    The panel will retain the right to apply provisions of the rule to purchases made more than three months before any bid, and in &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; to waive the rule on some purchases made less than three months before a bid. </TEXT></DOC>
