The Union of Communication Workers had promised Wednesday'swalkout would last only 24 hours but said the hiring of temporaryworkers could provoke indefinite strike actions.   Royal Mail, which holds a near-monopoly in mail services, arguedthat such hiring was done every Christmastime to clear backlogs andit would continue to implement contingency measures to plow througha backup of up to 100 million letters and parcels.   ``The vast majority of postal staff are back but we have someproblems around the country,'' said postal spokesman MartinPrestage. ``It's affecting a lot of customers today and tomorrow.   ``As we do at Christmas if we have a backlog of over 50 millionletters we bring in other workers,'' he said. ``A lot of regularstaff are not sympathetic to this.''   Areas affected by the new walkouts included parts of London,Manchester and Liverpool, the union said.   Prestage said the postal service also planned to use privatevehicles to tackle the pile-up, which could reach 100 millionpieces.   Wednesday's 24-hour strike, the first nationwide walkout atRoyal Mail since 1971, paralyzed mail deliveries in many parts ofEngland, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.   About 140,000 union workers involved in sorting and deliverywere called out on strike, and the union claimed nearly totalparticipation. Royal Mail disputed the claims but provided nofigures.   The dispute revolves around bonus payments for new recruits inLondon and southeast England, where Royal Mail has troubleattacting staff because of high living costs.   The union said it wanted bonus payments given either to allworkers or none. It said it feared the practice might lead to theend of national pay bargaining agreements.</TEXT></DOC>
