The pretrial ruling, handed down in a case in federalcourt in Norfolk, Va., permits ocean explorers ininternational waters to establish ownership of water-loggedtreasure by using remote video cameras to produce live images(&quot;tele-presence&quot;) and robots to retrieve objects(&quot;tele-possession&quot;). Previously, courts had ruled explorershad to physically dive to a site to stake a claim.   The wreck in question, the S.S. Central America, sank in8,000 feet of water 160 miles off North Carolina in 1857. Theluxury steamship was bound for New York carrying 428passengers and three tons of gold.   The concept of tele-presence and tele-possession may reachbeyond the sunken ship, however. Before the ruling, onlynations had been found to have deep-ocean salvage rights ininternational waters.   The precedent granting individuals the same rights couldaffect the future exploration and mining of deep-seaminerals, says Richard T. Robol, a maritime expert at Huntonandamp; Williams, a Richmond, Va., law firm; the firm is defendinga group of salvagers over legal claims to the ship's treasurein a lawsuit now in court in Norfolk. Ultimately, the rulingcould extend to outer space in settling claims over therecovery of stray satellites and space debris.   &quot;This is an exciting case for the freedom of individualsto discover, both in the deep ocean and in outer space,&quot; saysMr. Robol.                                                                                                          Some Law Firms Create   A Subspecialty in Art   TASTE IN ART may be subjective, but art sales and exhibitsincreasingly involve legal questions.   As a result, some law firms are cultivating a subspecialtythat combines aspects of business, contract and internationallaw with a solid knowledge of art.   A five-city U.S. tour of Ming and Qing dynasty paintings(1368-1911) from China last year raised intricate contractualproblems as well as a touchy international question. Whencontracting with museums, lawyers for the tour's sponsor hadto specify the exact type of light required to illuminate thedisplays with minimal damage. But first, the lawyers had todetermine whether the works could be seized by Americans whostill have claims pending against China for property lostwhen the Communists took power. (The answer was no.)   &quot;When art becomes more of an investment vehicle than acultural vehicle, a lot of business is involved,&quot; says JackR. Bershad, a Philadelphia corporate lawyer who negotiatedthe Ming and Qing dynasty tour, as well as the $40 millionsale of Andrew Wyeth's &quot;Helga&quot; and &quot;Olson&quot; series.   &quot;Art law is a very specialized commercial practice,&quot; saysCaryn R. Leland, a New York lawyer whose sole practice isrepresenting artists. &quot;You have a lot of contact with artistsand dealers, a lot of publications, a lot of copyright law,museum loans, options to buy art.&quot; The field also includeshelping artists buy homes and negotiate divorces.                                                                                                          Warning: Be Cautious   In Worker-Theft Cases                                                                                                          FIRING AN EMPLOYEE for heft can be trying for everyone,particularly if it leads to a lawsuit.   When a security director at Bloomingdale's in White Flint,Md., found an allegedly stolen calculator in a salesman'sattache case, she detained him in her office, had him sign aconfession and led him through the store in tears. Thesalesman filed a suit against Bloomingdale's alleging falsearrest, defamation and intentional infliction of emotionaldistress. A Bloomingdale's lawyer says the store actedproperly.   Maryland's highest court will soon decide whether the caseshould be thrown out of court. The state's Workers'Compensation Act, as in many states, bars suits againstemployers for accidental job injuries that result in physicaldisability. At issue here is whether the law also bars suitsin cases with no physical injuries.   Employment specialists are warning employers to treaddelicately when investigating suspected theft in theworkplace. At all times, says Earle K. Shawe, an expert atShawe andamp; Rosenthal in Baltimore, employers should be sureemployees feel free to leave the room or building while beingquestioned. Even refusing to allow a phone call or a run tothe bathroom, he adds, can lead to a claim of falseimprisonment.                                                                                                          Rodeo Drive Exclusivity   Doesn't Apply to Labels   IF CINCINNATI is home of &quot;Palm Beach Clothing&quot; and &quot;St.Tropez&quot; clothing is made in L.A., why can't Sidney Fell use&quot;Rodeo Drive&quot; on his label?   Mr. Fell says a group of specialty retailers on the famousBeverly Hills, Calif., shopping street don't like the stores-- Sears, Zayre, J.C. Penney and K mart -- that he sells hischildren's clothing to. Mr. Fell's California Guys 'N Gals ison South Flower Street in downtown Los Angeles.   The Rodeo Drive Committee has done much to promote thestreet's fabled exclusivity. But a federal judge in LosAngeles last September said it went too far in suing Mr. Fellin 1983 for trademark infringement.   The group won an injunction barring Mr. Fell from usingthe name on grounds it created confusion about the source ofthe goods. But that ruling was reversed in February by U.S.District Judge David V. Kenyon, who noted none of the storesmanufactures under &quot;Rodeo Drive.&quot;   Mr. Fell has resumed using the label and is pressing acountersuit against the group for $5 million in damages.Committee members declined to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
