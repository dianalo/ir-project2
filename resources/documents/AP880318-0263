The armed forces said guerrillas killed the mayor of a northerntown on Thursday, and the governing Christian Democratic Partyreported a mayoral candidate was kidnapped.   The warning was issued Wednesday night by the Pedro PabloCastillo Urban Command, a unit of the People's Revolutionary Army,one of five groups battling the U.S.-backed government.   The five groups, united in the Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front, have rejected the legislative and municipalelections. The rebels insist that peace must be achieved before anyelection is held.   They declared a nationwide ban on transportation as of today inan effort to disrupt the voting.   The statement was given to a local television crew that wastaken blindfolded to a guerrilla safe-house. Channel 6 broadcastpart of an interview and provided The Associated Press with atranscript of the rest Thursday.   The broadcast did not show the guerrillas.   The Defense Ministry said this week that about 53,000 of its56,000 troops will be deployed to provide election security.Defense Minister Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova said his men couldguarantee secure voting in 244 of the nation's 262 municipalities.   The guerrilla document advises people ``to avoid gathering atpolling places, because, due to the presence of troops, they ...will be considered military objectives by our units.''   It also called on filling stations to stop selling gasoline andwarned that the ones remaining open ``will be declared militaryobjectives.''   The leader of the urban cell, known as Commander Ester, told theTV crew: ``The urban commando cells are going to take a series ofactions to repudiate the elections and to repudiate U.S.intervention in our country.''   The guerrillas recently began urban units, and it was not clearif the statement covered the one group or the entire guerrillafront.   The United States provided almost $600 million in aid to ElSalvador last year, more than the amount given any other country inthe Western Hemisphere.   At least 65,000 people have died since the guerrillas took uparms in 1979.   The armed forces press office said guerrillas killed MayorSergio Romero of Azacualpa on Thursday. It said in a communiquethat the rebels then went to San Miguel de Mercedes, also innorthern Chalatenango province, and burned the mayor's office andthe post office.   The Christian Democrats said mayoral candidate Faustino Floresof Coatepeque in Santa Ana province was kidnapped Wednesday night.The party said guerrilla leaflets were found at Flores' house.   The guerrilla front says the elections are not legitimatebecause they cannot be free and fair in wartime.   The rebels demand a share of power in return for laying downtheir arms. The government rejects this.</TEXT></DOC>
