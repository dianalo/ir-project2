The five others were convicted oncharges including attempted murder, primarily on the basis ofvideotaped confessions they'd made, which pointed to Lopez asthe most brutal attacker.   In his videotape confession, Wise quoted Lopez as saying,&quot;We will rape her. That's what we'll do, rape her.&quot; ThenLopez &quot;just raped her and punched her in the eye and beather, beat her up.&quot;   &quot;While he was doing her, he got sick of looking at her,&quot;Wise said, so Lopez hit her twice in the head with a brick.Another attacker, Raymond Santana, was asked about Lopezduring his videotaped confession. &quot;After he hit her in thehead with the brick, was she moving?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; In the attack,the jogger lost three-quarters of her blood, an eyeballexploded in the back of her head and she was left for deadbound in her own clothes.   Despite the grotesque evidence, Steven Lopez will not goon trial for attempted murder after all. Nor will he go ontrial for rape or even for assaulting the jogger.   On Wednesday, Steven Lopez was allowed to plea bargain tostealing a radio from another jogger that night in CentralPark.   The reason: Alone among the attackers, Steven Lopezrefused to confess on videotape.   Given the current state of American justice, prosecutorswere probably lucky to strike the deal they did. When Lopezwas arrested the night of the attacks, all he admitted wasthat he'd been in the park. He realized what the others didnot: acting on the Miranda warning greatly reduces thechances of doing serious time. Lawyers for the others triedlater to argue that the confessions were somehow coerced; onedefendant said his grandmother didn't understand the Mirandawarning even though it was given in Spanish, but the judgerefused to suppress the evidence.   The wonder is not that Lopez refused to confess, but thatthe others admitted their crimes. We now have a long line ofSupreme Court cases discouraging defendants from voluntarilyconfessing their crimes. The most recent ruling quashed theconfession of a murderer because his lawyer was not in theroom when he described his crime to police.   Robert Morgenthau, the district attorney in Manhattan,drew the key lesson. &quot;This case is a reminder thatconfessions are crucial to law enforcment,&quot; he told us. &quot;Allthe impediments courts put in the way of confessions make ourjob much harder.&quot; That is especially so, he said, in a caselike this where the crime was so brutal that the jogger'sbrain was left incapable of identifying her attackers.   In other words, confession is good for more than the soul.One study found that before Miranda, 90% of the peoplearrested in Philadelphia made statements to the police. Afterthe justices shielded defendants from voluntary confessions,the percentage fell to 40%. As we've said before, judges havesent the message to police and prosecutors that if they can'tsolve a crime a la Sherlock Holmes, without a confession,then the crime will have to go unpunished.   In his plea bargain, Lopez admitted only to the last ofseveral attacks in the park that night. This was taking aradio from another jogger, a 6-foot-4-inch former Marine whopolice said looked after the attack as if &quot;he had been dippedin a bucket of blood.&quot; (The wilders said they threw the radioaway when they realized it didn't play cassettes.) Lopez willserve one-and-a-half to four years in a youth correctionalcenter, which means with the time he's already served hecould be out and back on the streets in September.   Before prosecutors agreed to the plea bargain, Mr.Morgenthau tried to get some of the other attackers totestify against Lopez. Even the promise of lowered sentenceswas not enough. Other witnesses told prosecutors they wouldrather go to jail on criminal contempt charges than risk thewrath of Lopez and his supporters.   The escape from full justice by this Central Park attackersends a tragic message, most of all to the inner-city parentswho are trying to raise children with some respect for law,or very simply, what is right and wrong. Instead, the messagehere is that our criminal-justice system has been transformedinto a complex game. Right and wrong are irrelevant; all youneed to know are the rules on how to win. Whatever theexclusionary rule was supposed to accomplish, nothing in theConstitution calls for replacing justice with cruel farce.</TEXT></DOC>
