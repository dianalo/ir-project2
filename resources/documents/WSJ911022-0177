But before you toss the plastic and head for the nearesttree, consider this: Some of the nation's mightiest marketerssay they have built a better brush. Procter andamp; Gamble Co., forone, says that its new Crest Complete toothbrush, whichsports long, &quot;rippled&quot; bristles, has the ability to &quot;reachbetween teeth . . . up to 39% farther than leading flatbrushes.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Then there is Johnson andamp; Johnson's new Advanced DesignReach, which has a tapered head, an angled neck and, saysJandamp;J, a &quot;unique non-slip handle.&quot;Pfizer Inc.'s Plax brushboasts a groove for the thumb. SmithKline Beecham's AquafreshFlex, coming on the market this month, has rounded innerbristles and soft outer ones. One of the new models evenglows in the dark (in your choice of yellow or pink).   &quot;It's a modern marketing saga: These guys have taken acommodity product and made it into a very big market,&quot;rhapsodizes Kevin Foley, co-founder of Radius Corp. Mr.Foley's own oval-headed creations, which sell for a whopping$9.95, include a red Glasnost-inspired number with a hammerand sickle on its handle and a black neoprene model thatlooks like a scuba accessory.   The transformation of the once-banal brush business hasbeen striking. Until the late 1970s, most toothbrushes weresold exclusively on the basis of price. But in recent years,marketers have begun churning out scores ofever-so-slightly-varied new products. This year, retailerssay, new-product development has hit an unprecedented high.   A key factor is demographics: In aging baby boomers, thebrush sellers have apparently found a receptive audience.These consumers have grown less worried about developingcavities but increasingly concerned about the health of theirgums. And they are willing to pay a premium for thenewfangled instruments. In part, that's because toothbrushesare typically an impulse purchase, and shoppers often don'thave the foggiest idea of how much they paid for the lastone.   That kind of confusion has been a boon for brushes sold onthe basis of performance rather than price. They now accountfor about 60% of sales, up from 13% just over a decade ago.At more than $2 each, they easily cost twice as much as thebudget rivals and have kept the $350 million toothbrushmarket growing at a 6% to 10% annual rate -- faster thannearly any other personal-care product.   But the brush makers now face an obstacle: Americans maybe willing to experiment with new brushes and even pay apremium for them; but, marketers say, they replace theirtoothbrushes on the average only once every nine months.Fastidious Japanese consumers, by comparison, replace theirsevery three months.   So in addition to whipping up new bristle configurations,marketers are now working overtime to coax consumers intochanging brushes long before the bristles splay. Packages ofsome Johnson andamp; Johnson toothbrushes include the followingadmonishment: &quot;Change your toothbrush at least every threemonths.&quot;   Oral-B Laboratories, a unit of Gillette Co., may have hitupon a better gimmick. Its Indicator brush, which beganarriving on retailers' shelves this summer, has a patch ofblue bristles that fade to white with about four months' use-- a replacement reminder even the least conscientiousbrushers might find difficult to ignore.   The concept caught the attention of Paul H. Crosby, a WallStreet securities trader. Already an Oral-B user, Mr. Crosbynoticed the Indicator in his drug store and decided to giveit a try. He likes it. But even Mr. Crosby allows that hiswillingness to experiment has its limits: &quot;I buy only blue,clear or dark red toothbrushes,&quot; he says. &quot;No yellow for me-- I'm a man.&quot;   Three months may sound like a fleeting life span, but theAmerican Dental Association has long been pushing the conceptof the quickly obsolete brush. That's because frayed or bentbristles cannot properly clean between the teeth and gums,and may actually cause periodontal injuries. But the bad newsfor the brushmongers is that while the ADA recommendssoft-bristle numbers, it believes that all the hightechtoothbrushes are basically created equal. An ADA spokesmanputs it this way: &quot;Does the shape of the head really matter?No]&quot;   In fact, despite marketers' best efforts, there have beenfew milestones in toothbrush design over the past century.The industry was revolutionized in 1938 by Dr. West's MiracleTuft Toothbrush -- the world's first nylon-bristle brush.Prior to that, a breed of Siberian hogs provided the bulk ofbristles. By the late 1940s, Oral-B had begun selling asoft-bristle brush.   The next significant development came in 1961 with thewhine of the Broxodent -- the first electric toothbrush. Butwhile the modern versions are a far cry from their bulkyelectric forbearers, they can be found in only about 6% ofU.S. households, thanks mostly to high prices. To spur salesof its $70 Interplak brush, Bausch andamp; Lomb Inc. is about tolaunch a new print advertising campaign touting the product'sability to combat gum disease. Eventually, the company isbetting 30% of Americans will go for electric gadgets.   As for the manual brush marketers, Johnson andamp; Johnson incoming months is expected to shell out $8 million to $10million to introduce its new Reach brush ($2.29 suggestedretail price), mostly on television ads. Commercialsfeaturing Mr. Reach, an animated, oral-hygiene enthusiastpreoccupied with cleaning his back teeth, will begin airinglater this month.   Johnson andamp; Johnson has plenty of experience in the brushbattles. The company sent shock waves through the industry in1977, when it bought the Reach brand from Du Pont and rolledout the odd-looking product by spending lavishly on consumeradvertising and promotion. Boasts Mitchell Kon, Jandamp;J's groupproduct director for the No.3-ranked Reach brand: &quot;We madethe category and we consider ourselves the innovator.&quot;   So far, though, Gillette's Oral-B is continuing to cleanup with about 35% of the market. It is counting on its newIndicator brush ($2.50 to $3) to stay out in front. Retailersare expecting the company to spend $10 million to sellconsumers on the Indicator's early-replacement warningsystem. New television commercials dramatize the brushes'fading bristles in action and point out that even dentistssometimes forget to replace their brushes every three months.   For its debut in the U.S. toothbrush market, theformidable Procter andamp; Gamble is testing Crest Complete ($2.29to $2.89) in two Texas cities. Television and printadvertising in the test markets began last month. Althoughthe company is keeping its mouth closed about its plans,industry insiders expect the Crest toothbrush will soon besold nationally.   Since most of the &quot;trailblazing&quot; brushes are just reachingretailers' shelves, it is too early to call the winners. Butindustry analysts say Procter's rippled brush is certain tomake waves. &quot;I'd put my money on Crest, because of thepowerful brand and the company's awesome distribution,&quot; saysBonita Austin, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co.&quot;Everybody in the U.S. already knows Crest.&quot;   And retailers have proved receptive to the avalanche ofnew brushes. It's no wonder: At over 30%, retailers' grossmargins on toothbrushes are more than twice as high as fortoothpaste, which is sometimes sold at a loss to bring incustomers.   To accommodate the plethora of new products, massmerchandiser Kmart Corp. has increased the amount of shelfspace it devotes to toothbrushes to an average 7.5 feet fromabout two feet just over two years ago. &quot;I see a new brushevery week,&quot; marvels Tim Findlay, who buys toothbrushes forKmart. &quot;If I wanted to carry everybody's product, I'd need 12feet of space.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
