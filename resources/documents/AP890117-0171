Arafat denied he threatened a Palestinian mayor on the West Bankwho proposed a truce in the Palestinian uprising. He also said thePalestine Liberation Organization is cooperating in a probe to trackdown the bomber of Pan Am Flight 103.   Speaking at a news conference at the end of a two-day visit toFinland, Arafat rejected the notion of elections in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip because the Palestinians had ``very, verybad experiences of elections run by Israel.''   ``The only elections which are acceptable are under the auspicesof the United Nations after the withdrawal of Israel,'' Arafat said.   The last voting in the territories was in municipal elections in1976, when candidates supporting the PLO were swept into office.Many of the elected mayors later were deposed. Two were targets of aJewish underground and were maimed in bomb attacks.   ``One lesson is enough,'' Arafat said.   The Israeli Labor Party proposed an election to chose analternative leadership that could negotiate for the Palestinians,but the Likud Party under Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has beencool to the idea.   Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, which it considers a terroristorganization, and it has dismissed Arafat's declaration last monthrenouncing terrorism and accepting Israel's right to exist as apublic relations ploy.   Arafat denied he threatened Elias Freij, mayor of Bethlehem, whosuggested a truce in the 13-month uprising on condition that Israelrelease Palestinian leaders.   Freij, one of the few elected in 1976 still in office, withdrewthe proposal after a broadcast on Monte Carlo radio quoted Arafat assaying:   ``Any Palestinian leader who proposes an end to the intifadeh(uprising) exposes himself to the bullets of his own people andendangers his life. The PLO will know how to deal with him.''   Asked about the broadcast by a reporter at a reception after thenews conference, Arafat said the radio ``misquoted me. I said if Itried to stop the intifadeh the small boy who is standing beside mewould shoot me.''   The uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territories Israelseized from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war, has leftat least 362 Palestinians and 15 Israelis dead.   Arafat also said the PLO is cooperating to find who sabotaged PanAmerican Flight 103, which blew up over Scotland on Dec. 21, killing270 people.   ``We are doing our best ... because this is an awful crime,'' hesaid, declining to elaborate.   He said 94 countries have officially recognized the state ofPalestine which the Palestine National Council, the PLO'sparliament-in-exile, declared Nov. 15. He said he expected thatnumber to rise to 120 within a few weeks.   On his second day in Finland, Arafat met members of Parliamentand leaders of the political parties. He held talks Monday withPresident Mauno Koivisto, Prime Minister Harri Holkeri, and ForeignMinister Kalevi Sorsa.   The PLO leader left the Finnish capital Tuesday evening for anunknown destination aboard an Iraqi airliner.   In Tunis, Bassam Abu Sharif, chief Arafat spokesman, met the U.S.ambassador to Tunisia briefly Sunday at a dinner given by theBritish Embassy for visiting Foreign Office Minister WilliamWaldegrave, the Tunisian newspaper Assabah reported.   Abu Sharif confirmed the meeting in the Tunisian capital and saidhe discussed the situation in the Israeli-occupied territories withAmbassador Robert Pelletreau.   Pelletreau held his first official meeting Dec. 16 in Tunis witha delegation of high-ranking of the PLO, which is based in Tunis.</TEXT></DOC>
