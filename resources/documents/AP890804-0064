(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lawyers for the state of Vermont saidFriday that they are appealing a federal judge's ruling that a70-year-old state Supreme Court justice cannot be forced to retirebecause of his age.   Lawyers for the state of Vermont on Friday filed a notice inU.S. District Court in Rutland that the case was being appealed tothe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York.   At issue is whether a federal law prohibiting age discriminationapplies to appointed state judges. U.S. District Judge LeeGagliardi ruled last month that it does and struck down a stateorder that Justice Louis Peck retire.   His ruling, in effect, nullified a section of the VermontConstitution that requires all judges to retire at age 70. Peckturned 70 last December, but refused to retire and filed suit whenthe state ordered that he do so.   Lawyer William Gray, representing the state, said he filed anotice in U.S. District Court in Rutland that the state wasappealing to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.   ``The decision by the district court is inconsistent with otherrulings on the question and we feel it appropriate that the issuebe addressed by the 2nd Circuit,'' he said.   Even though Peck won in the first round, he said he welcomed theappeal. ``I think it is fair to say that both sides want this to goas high as it can,'' said the justice, one of five on Vermont'sonly appeals court.   ``The higher it goes, the greater an impact it will have,'' Pecksaid. ``What we really hope is that the U.S. Supreme Court willagree to hear this so that we can finally settle the question onceand for all.''   Gagliardi's ruling within the territory covered by the 2ndCircuit conflicts with rulings by a federal judge in Massachusettsand the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the federallaw prohibiting discrimination does not apply to appointed statejudges.   ``We believe that the confusion coming out of these cases maymake it more attractive for the (U.S. Supreme) court to agree tohear this,'' said Peck.   The disagreement is whether the federal Age Discrimination inEmployment Act supersedes state mandatory retirement provisions forjudges. The law prohibits age discrimination, but excludes certaingroups from the provision.   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which representsPeck, argues that judges don't fall under any of the exceptions.   Gray argues that judges fall under the exception granted forpolicymakers, and that the Constitution requires Congress to stateits intention clearly when it wants to regulate qualifications forsuch important state offices as judges.   ``I expect our brief will address both the interpretation of thestatute and the constitutional implications,'' Gray said.   If the ruling stands under appeal, Peck can remain on theSupreme Court until his term expires in three years. He could alsoseek another six-year term.</TEXT></DOC>
