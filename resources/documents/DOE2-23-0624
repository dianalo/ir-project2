When compared to non-exposed control animals,no significant differences were noted for either of these cytogeneticend points. In addition, there was not a significant difference in sisterchromatid exchange response to a challenge dose of mitomycin C in cellsfrom 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin exposed animals compared tocontrols. The results confirm the lack of genotoxic effects associatedwith 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin exposure.</TEXT></DOC>
