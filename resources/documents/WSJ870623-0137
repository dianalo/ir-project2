I could not agree more, and your readers may be interested in how much more capability the Army has now compared with 1980.    The Army has increased the U.S.'s deterrence by adding combat units, modernizing equipment and improving training through the use of money-saving technology. While maintaining the smallest Army since World War II we have generated 24 new combat battalions by eliminating support jobs, and added 27 more in the Guard and Reserve. We have modernized 25% of our tank battalions with the M-1, called &quot;whispering death&quot; by the Germans, a tank two to three times more lethal than the worn M-60. One-third of our mechanized battalions now are equipped with the high-firepower Bradley Fighting Vehicle. We've also deployed 348 rocket artillery systems, each of which packs more firepower than an entire battery (six tubes) of eight-inch howitzers.    Army Chief of Staff Gen. John A. Wickham Jr. states that the U.S. now has the best Army in his 41 years of service. More than 90% of our soldiers are high-school graduates. Discipline indicators, AWOLs, crimes against property and violence are the lowest in the Army's history. Smarter soldiers are better soldiers.    The last of the services to modernize, the Army is only one-third through the process. As an infantryman and a taxpayer, I have no doubts that our Army is more capable and, by any measure, well worth its cost.    Maj. James L. Fetig   U.S. Army Public Affairs   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
