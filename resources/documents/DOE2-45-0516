In all patients signal decrease inthe involved cavernous sinus was demonstrated in coronal spinecho (SE)imaging. It is attributable to rapid venous flow in the sinus, and this'high velocity signal loss' is a fairly pathognomonic finding in thiscondition. We stress the validity of MR imaging in the primary diagnosisof dural AVMs with ophthalmic symptoms.</TEXT></DOC>
