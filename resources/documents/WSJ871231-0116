DeBartolo Corp.    The definitive agreement caps a year in which Little Rock, Ark.-based Dillard made a number of acquisitions, including the Joske's and Cain-Sloan divisions bought from Allied Stores Corp. for $255 million, as well as a number of single-store purchases in the Midwest and Southwest.    A Dillard spokesman said Dillard would be responsible for the retail operations of the 14-store chain, while DeBartolo would handle the real estate side. DeBartolo is a shopping center development and management concern based in Youngstown, Ohio. The Dillard spokesman said the $165 million price would be split in the 50-50 joint venture.    In a statement prepared for investors, Walter Loeb, a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. analyst, said he expects the purchase of Cleveland-based Higbee to provide a &quot;small increase&quot; in Dillard's 1988 earnings. For the 39 weeks ended Oct. 31, Dillard had net income of $41.5 million, or $1.29 a share, on sales of $1.43 billion.    Dillard said Higbee had sales of $300 million in 1987 and projected that its 1988 sales would be $312 million.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dillard closed at $25.875 a share, down 37.5 cents.    Edward J. DeBartolo Sr., chairman and chief executive officer of closely held DeBartolo Corp., has been interested for some time in acquiring a department store chain but hadn't been successful. In late 1986, his company and Limited Inc. made an unsuccessful hostile takeover offer for Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. of Los Angeles. And earlier that year, he and investor Paul Bilzerian agreed to acquire Allied Stores Corp., but that was thwarted when Campeau Corp. made a takeover bid itself for Allied that was later successful.    The empire of Mr. DeBartolo and his family has included more than 50 major shopping centers, a myriad of other real estate holdings, the San Francisco 49ers football team and other sports concerns, and three major race tracks.    Brierley is a New Zealand-based investment company.    All of Higbee's stores are in northeastern Ohio. Dillard has 138 stores in 11 states. </TEXT></DOC>
