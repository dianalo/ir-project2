The Soviet population climbed 9.3 percent during the past decadeand now stands at 286.7 million, with the largest increases in thecentral Asian regions, according to census figures publishedSaturday.   A top Soviet statistician expressed concern the population hadnot increased faster _ which he said was necessary to ensuregreater economic development _ and that growth rates were low inEuropean regions.   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, devoted an entire page topreliminary results of the nationwide census conducted in January,the country's first since 1979.   The demographic center of the Soviet Union is gradually shiftingfrom the European Slavic heartland _ the Russian federation, theUkraine and Byelorussia _ to Central Asia, according to data fromthe State Committee on Statistics.   Those numbers represent troublesome trends for the Sovietleadership, which has been trying to keep the country's peasantryon the farm and has acknowledged it cannot create jobs fast enoughin Central Asia to keep pace with population growth.   The total number of Soviets grew by 24.3 million in the past 10years and stood at 286.7 million Jan. 12. That represents a growthof 9.3 percent since 1979.   Four traditionally Moslem republics in Soviet Central Asiaregistered the greatest population increases: a 34 percent rise inTadzhikistan, 29 percent in Uzbekistan, 28 percent in Turkmenia and22 percent in Kirghizia.   Azerbaijan, the only predominantly Moslem republic in the SovietCaucasus, had a 17 percent increase in population, and in the fifthCentral Asian republic, Kazakhstan, the number of people rose 13percent.   Population growth in the rest of the country did not exceed 10percent.   ``The scope of the development of the Soviet economy and theneed for additional manpower resources to develop economicallypromising areas call for greater population growth,'' NikolaiBelov, State Statistics Committee deputy chairman, told theofficial Tass news agency. ``This especially concerns some regions,above all in the European part of the country and in the Far East.''   The Russian federation, the largest of the 15 constituent Sovietrepublics, remains the most populated with 147.4 millioninhabitants, but its population grew by only 7 percent.   The Ukraine remains second with 51.7 million people, but theincrease only was 4 percent. In Byelorussia, the population rose 7percent.   In the past decade, the Soviet rural population dropped 38percent, to 34 percent of the total.   However, Tass said, high population growth rates were registeredin Central Asia's rural regions, ``as a result of which thereemerged the problem of the able-bodied population's employment inthe countryside.''   A total of 10.6 million Soviets migrated from villages tocities, and the country's urban population grew by 25.2 million, or15 percent, Tass said in a dispatch summarizing census results.   That would aggravate an already serious housing problem. One ofevery five urban residents in the Soviet Union lives in dormitoriesor in communal apartments with common kitchens, bathrooms and otherfacilities.   As a result of the flight from the countryside to the cities,there are now ``far more men'' aged 18-29 than women living in therural regions of most Soviet republics, Tass said. ``Given such aratio, not all men can marry,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
