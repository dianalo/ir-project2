Officers and employeesmust be sensitive to this public perception when considering future employmentopportunities and avoid any action which would cause loss of public confidencein their performance of official duties.(2) DLA personnel shall not perform any official duties, or otherwise participatein any official matter dealing with any organization with which the DLAemployee is pursuing employment, has any arrangement concerning futureemployment, or has a financial interest. Pursuing employment is not limitedto firm offers of employment; it includes any action which could reasonablybe construed as an indication of interest in future employment, includingsending letters or reandCx.174;1sumeandCx.174;1s, telephone discussions, orthe consideration of unsolicited proposals from a business entity regardingpossible future employment.(3) All DLA personnel who have contact (regardless of who initiated thecontact) regarding possible future employment, or have any arrangementconcerning future employment with any organization that may be affectedby the performance of their official duties shall immediately report thecontact to the Designated Agency Ethics Official or Deputy Ethics Official.So long as the decision on future employment with the organization remainsopen, DLA personnel must disqualify themselves from participating in anymanner in any official action involving that organization. Thus, if a DLAemployee mails resumes to multiple organizations, that may be affectedby the performance of official duties, the DLA employee must report thesending of resumes, disqualify himself/herself from participating in mattersinvolving those organizations until either the organization or the employeespecifically terminates the employment possibilities. Disqualificationprocedures are set forth in andSection; 1293.7(c).(l) <T3>Restrictions on the activities of former officers and employees. </T3>Lawsand regulations impose restrictions on the activities of individuals whohave ceased Federal employment.

Caution</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Employees and former employees are cautioned that the descriptionsof the laws and regulations in this enclosure should not be the only thingrelied upon to make decisions regarding their activities. Although thedescriptions do provide general guidelines, restrictions are dependenton the specific facts in a particular case. Accordingly, employees andformer employees are encouraged to discuss specific cases with the DesignatedAgency Ethics Official or Deputy Ethics Official in their Office of Counsel,or with private counsel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">II. Conflict of Interest Laws</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">A. 18 U.S.C. 203</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Subsection (a) prohibits military officers or civilian employeesfrom directly or indirectly receiving or seeking compensation for servicesrendered or to be rendered before any department or agency in connectionwith any contract, claim, controversy or particular matter in which theUnited States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest. Thestatute does not apply to enlisted military personnel. The purpose of thislaw is to reach any situation where the judgment or efficiency of a Governmentagency might be influenced because of payments or gifts to an officer oremployee regardless of whether there is any intent to give preferentialtreatment in a manner otherwise than provided by law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Subsection (b) makes it unlawful for anyone to offer or to paythe compensation prohibited by subsection (a).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">B. 18 U.S.C. 205</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. This law prohibits military officers or civilian employees fromacting as an agent or attorney for anyone else before a department, agency,or court in connection with any particular matter in which the United Statesis a party or has a direct and substantial interest. The law does not applyto enlisted military personnel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The following exemptions are allowed:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The law does not prohibit military officers or civilian employeesfrom giving testimony under oath; from making statements required to bemade under the penalty of perjury or contempt; or, from representing anotherperson, without compensation, in a personnel matter such as a discriminationcomplaint or disciplinary action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The law also authorizes a limited waiver of its restrictions andthose of section 203 for an officer or employee, including a special Governmentemployee, who represents his or her parents, spouse, or child, or a personor estate he or she serves as a fiduciary. The waiver is available onlyif approved by the official making appointments to the position. However,the waiver does not allow the officer or employee to represent any personin matters in which the officer or employee has participated personallyand substantially or which are the subject of the officer or employee'sofficial responsibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Finally, section 205 gives the head of a department or agency theauthority to allow a special Government employee to represent his or herregular employer or other outside organization in the performance of workunder a Government grant or contract if the department or agency head certifiesand publishes in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> that the national interest requires such representation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">C. 18 U.S.C. 208</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Subsection (a) prohibits military officers and civilian personnelfrom their personal and substantial participation as Government personnelin any particular matter in which they, their spouse, their minor children,their partners, their employers, their prospective employers, or theirorganizations have a financial interest. ``Personal and substantial participation''includes such things as decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation,the rendering of advice, or investigation. A ``particular matter'' maybe less concrete than an actual contract, but is something more specificthan rule making or abstract scientific principles. If the individual canreasonably anticipate that his/her Government action, or the decision inwhich he/she participates or with respect to which he/she advises, willhave a direct and predictable effect upon financial interests, then a ``particularmatter'' is involved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Subsection (b) permits a written exemption from subsection (a)if the outside financial interest is deemed in advance not substantialenough to affect the integrity of Government services. Categories of financialinterests may also be made nondisqualifying by a regulation published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>.

The purpose of the post employment restrictions is to precludethe actual or apparent use of public office for private gain, and to ensurethat the administration of Government is conducted honestly and in an impartialmanner.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The restrictions are divided into five parts; those applicableto all former officers and employees, those applicable to former senioremployees, those applicable to retired military officers, and those applicableto all retired members of the Armed Forces. In addition, the special restrictionsapplicable to personnel who were engaged in ``procurement functions'' areset out. Because of the expansive definition of the term ``procurementfunction,'' all civilian employees whose grade was GS-12, step 7 or higher,and all military personnel in grades O-4 and above should review the definitionof ``procurement function'' set forth in subparagraph H6i below. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.
