(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA's last-ditch effort to fixAtlantis' hydrogen leak on the launch pad failed Wednesday, forcingthe trouble-plagued agency to postpone the space shuttle's flightuntil later this year.   NASA engineers, who had hoped to avoid a long launch delay byquickly repairing the leak on the pad, said the shuttle must bereturned to the hangar for more work. It had been scheduled for asecret military mission this month.   Shuttle Columbia, still under repairs because of a differentsort of hydrogen leak which scrubbed a May launch, will be the nextshuttle to fly. It is scheduled for an astronomy mission in earlySeptember, and NASA says it expects the leak to be fixed in time.   The developments came as a space agency team began probing thecause of NASA's highest-profile problem: the flawed mirror on the$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.   The seven-member team, led by Lew Allen, director of NASA's jetpropulsion laboratory, took testimony in secret Wednesday atHughes-Danbury Optical Systems Inc., the maker of the mirror.   The flaw has halved the effectiveness of the telescope, whichwas put in orbit on an April shuttle mission.   NASA, facing mounting criticism in Congress because of thestring of setbacks, got one piece of good news Wednesday: Athrice-delayed Atlas rocket launch finally went off without a flaw.   The rocket carried a government device designed to studyelectric fields in space and the Van Allen radiation fields.   ``It's good to have something positive happen,'' said NASAspokesman Jim Cast. ``It's a definite boost to NASA morale.''   The Atlas launch had been delayed three times, because of apower problem, bad weather and a helium leak.   On the shuttle, experts had hoped Atlantis' problem could besolved by simple launch pad repairs. But the leak reappeared duringa test Wednesday and, after analyzing the data, engineers concludedthey still didn't fully understand the problem.   ``We were not able to fix it. We have learned more so we willroll back smarter,'' said William Lenoir, head of NASA's spaceflight program.   NASA will try to launch Atlantis on its classified Pentagonflight in November.   The latest leak, detected when liquid hydrogen was pumped intoAtlantis' external fuel tank, was about the size of the leakdetected in two previous tests and was in the same area, a flangein a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen from the tank to the mainengines.   Workers tightened bolts around the flange and checked the welds,even though engineers doubted that would be enough to correct theproblem.   Had the spot been leak-free Wednesday, NASA would have tried tolaunch Atlantis in mid-August and Columbia in September.   Now officials intend to get Columbia ready to move to the launchpad in early August, said shuttle director Robert Crippen.   NASA officials want to get at least one shuttle up beforeDiscovery's October mission with Ulysses, a satellite that willexplore the sun's poles. Discovery has a 19-day ``window'' in whichit must lift off or the mission will be delayed 13 months. Thatwould be the next time Earth is in proper alignment again with thesun and Jupiter.   If NASA hadn't tried to fix Atlantis at the launch pad, ``wewould have forever wondered if we could have gotten two off beforeUlysses,'' Lenoir said.   The delay in launching Atlantis means NASA must bump yet anothermission into next year. The space agency originally had plannednine shuttle flights for 1990, but now is down to seven. So far,only three have been flown.   Columbia had been due to lift off May 30 with the $150 millionAstro observatory for study of ultraviolet light and X-rays emittedby stars and other celestial objects. Columbia's leak was detectedduring fueling, six hours before liftoff.   The space agency has since replaced Columbia's leaky plumbingwith components from the unfinished shuttle Endeavour. Columbia'sleak is believed to be larger than the one plaguing Atlantis and ina different place.   Crippen said it's too soon to say how Atlantis' leaky fuel linewill be repaired. One option is to attach a new external tank.   The discovery of Atlantis' first leak, on June 29, prompted NASAto temporarily ground its three-shuttle fleet. The leak reappearedduring a more elaborate test two weeks later.   The Hubble telescope isn't expected to fulfill its potentialuntil space-walking astronauts make repairs in 1993.   Allen of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said the Hubble probershoped to find what Allen called a ``smoking gun and a fingerprinton the trigger.''   Investigators, who expected to stay through Thursday, alsoplanned to examine reams of data pertaining to the manufacturingand testing of the mirror, and equipment used to test the accuracyof the mirror.   NASA's proposed space station Freedom also is under attack.Studies show the station will require more maintenance than isfeasible unless major design changes are made.</TEXT></DOC>
