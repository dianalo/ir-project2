Lindner.    The transaction is valued at $1.45 billion. The partnership already owns 46.3% of Taft's 9.2 million shares outstanding, and will pay about $780 million for the additional shares.    The agreement, which was expected, ends the turmoil that has surrounded the communications and entertainment concern for almost two years since management and major shareholders sought various measures to reorganize the company.    Besides Mr. Lindner -- chairman of American Financial Corp., which together with Mr. Lindner holds 16.2% of Taft -- the partnership includes former rivals for Taft: Texas investor Robert M. Bass, whose investment group holds a 24.9% stake in the company, and a group led by Taft Vice Chairman Dudley S. Taft. Mr. Taft's group, which holds 5.2% of Taft, proposed in March to take Taft Broadcasting private for $150 a share, but later withdrew the bid to join Mr. Lindner's partnership.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Taft shares closed at $151.75, up $1.25.    Under terms of the agreement, Taft Broadcasting will be acquired by TFBA Limited Partnership. TFBA's general partner is FMI Financial Corp., a holding company that is 72%-owned by Mr. Lindner's American Financial. The Bass and Taft groups would be limited partners.    Although the transaction is structured as a partnership -- an attempt by the investors to reduce taxes on their gains -- Taft Broadcasting will be controlled by Mr. Lindner.    The transaction must be approved by Taft shareholders and the Federal Communications Commission. With such clearance, Messrs. Bass and Taft are expected to exchange their interest in the partnership for certain Taft properties.    As previously reported, the partnership agreement calls for Taft Broadcasting to sell its WGHP-TV station in High Point, N.C., for more than $45 million to a partnership formed by the Taft family. Under certain conditions, the Taft family could purchase the broadcasting company's WBRC-TV station in Birmingham, Ala., for an undisclosed price. The Taft family also would have the right to use the name &quot;Taft&quot; in their future broadcasting venture, indicating that the current Taft Broadcasting will be renamed.    The partnership agreement also makes provisions for the Bass group to acquire Taft Broadcasting's WTVN-TV in Columbus, Ohio, and Taft's interests in two cable-television operations.    Under the agreement, Taft shareholders will receive at their option $157 in cash or $144 in cash and one share of FMI Financial common stock for each share of Taft common.    Taft said that if the transaction closes after Sept. 30, shareholders accepting either option would receive an additional 50 cents a share for each month between Oct. 1 and the closing, but not beyond next March 31. The provision is intended to mollify Taft shareholders in case it takes longer than customary for the transaction to secure the regulatory clearances.    A spokesman for American Financial said the company expects the FCC to &quot;approve the transaction in the normal 60 to 90 day period.&quot; But some industry observers are skeptical.    Mr. Lindner has run into trouble previously with federal regulators. Twice, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged him with violating federal securities laws, allegations he later settled with the agency without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The cases prompted the FCC in 1979 to closely scrutinize Mr. Lindner's then 5% stake in Gannett Co. At the time, the agency suggested it might oppose Mr. Lindner's possible involvement in Gannett management.    An FCC spokeswoman wouldn't comment yesterday on the possibility that Mr. Lindner's bid to acquire Taft would be challenged. However, she said that since 1980 the FCC no longer considers securities-law violations as grounds for denying applications by licensees.    FMI would be gaining control of a much larger company in the transaction. In the year ended March 31, Taft had a net loss of $53.1 million on revenue of $499.8 million. For 1986, FMI had net income of $77.6 million, or $2.77 a share, on revenue of $121 million.    Taft owns seven television and 15 radio stations, an entertainment group that produces animation through Hanna-Barbera Productions, movies such as the recent &quot;Light of Day&quot; starring Michael J. Fox, and television shows. It also distributes reruns of shows such as &quot;Love Boat&quot; and has interests in amusement parks. </TEXT></DOC>
