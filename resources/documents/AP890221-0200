(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Seven gun owners assisted by theNational Rifle Association prepared Tuesday to ask the CaliforniaSupreme Court to rule that state law pre-empts city bans onsemiautomatic rifles in Stockton and Los Angeles.   The two cities enacted ordinances this month after a gunmankilled five children and wounded 30 other people at a Stocktonelementary school on Jan. 17.   The gun owners, including two Stockton residents and two LosAngeles police officers, prepared to file suit directly to the stateSupreme Court because the two cities and other communities that haveenacted similar laws are in different state appellate districts,said Richard Gardiner, assistant general counsel for the NRA.   The case belongs in the high court because it is of significantstatewide importance, Gardiner said.   Four of the plaintiffs told a news conference at a Universal Cityhotel that the city ordinances take away rights and instill fearthat the bans will lead to action against other types of firearms.   Gardiner and the gun owners said that rather than controllingguns, the justice system should deal more strongly with criminalssuch as the Stockton gunman, Patrick Purdy, who killed himself afterthe schoolyard massacre.   ``I'm paying the price that unfortunately the man who committedthe crime in Stockton is not alive to pay,'' said Bill Hilburn, aDepartment of Energy engineer who lives two miles from the Stocktonschool. ``Nobody is more outraged about what happened in myhometown.''   Tony Acevedo, 35, complained that the Stockton City Council'saction makes him a criminal for owning such weapons.   Donald Castillo of Los Angeles, an aerospace electronicsengineer, said he was interested in target shooting with such gunsand he worries the bans will lead to attacks on other civilliberties.   ``I'm here because I'm scared to death,'' Castillo said.   Andre Coulombe, a financial consultant in Los Angeles, said heworks with a youth Explorer group and fears he will no longer beallowed to engage in such activities as firearms instruction, whichhe says teaches discipline.   Gardiner identified the other three plaintiffs as Robert Feeley,a Los Angeles lawyer, and Sgt. Louis Salsedo and Officer GeorgeLuczy, both Los Angeles police officers.   Los Angeles officials said they will delay any attempts toenforce the ban on possessing the weapons until March 1. Severalother proposed gun bans are being considered in various committeesof the Legislature.   The NRA counsel asserted that the city bans are really againstall semiautomatic rifles. He said the mechanism of the so-calledmilitary style assault rifles are the same as other types ofsemiautomatic rifles. The only real difference, he said, is that themilitary-style weapons have certain ``external additions'' likebolts on the barrels or attaching bayonets.   Gardiner preferred to use the term ``self-loading'' rather thansemiautomatic and asserted that semiautomatic weapons that have comeinto question are not assault rifles. He said only the fullyautomatic military versions of those guns, which fire repeatedlyrather than once with each trigger pull, are assault rifles.   ``The whole thing is largely a media creation and needs to betreated as such,'' Gardiner said.</TEXT></DOC>
