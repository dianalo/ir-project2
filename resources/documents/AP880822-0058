STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 400 workers carrying Polish flagsand chanting ``Solidarity'' seized control of the Lenin shipyardtoday, joining a wave of strikes that poses the most seriouschallenge to communist authorities since 1981.   The Lenin shipyard became the 13th enterprise in a week to go onstrike for higher pay and government recognition of Solidarity, thetrade federation that was suppressed under martial law in 1981.   At least 10 coal mines in southern Poland and transit anddockworkers in Szczecin remained on strike on the seventh day ofthe labor unrest, which has idled more than 76,000 workers.   Some Gdansk port workers also were striking as of today,according to reports from Western journalists. A Solidarityspokesman, Jacek Kuron, said 3,000 Gdansk dockworkers were onstrike.   Aside from the shipyard, which employs 10,000 people, no newstrikes were confirmed by authorities today. But there were manyopposition reports of labor unrest nationwide.   Activists in Warsaw reported an attempt to start a strike at the14,000-worker Ursus tractor plant outside the city. A rally at theplant was dispersed by police during the morning shift, resultingin three detentions, said activist Maciej Jankowski. But he saidworkers laid down tools in some departments.   A management spokesman at Ursus who did not give his nameconfirmed an unsuccessful attempt to strike at the plant, but madeno mention of police and said work continued normally.   In southeastern Poland, Solidarity organizer Ewa Kuberna saidworkers rallied at the 18,000-employee Stalowa Wola steel mill andheavy machinery plant, and a strike was launched by 2,000 of theworkers.   Government spokesman Ryszard Straus said people might bestanding around at Stalowa Wola but it did not necessarily mean astrike.   Opposition spokesman Wojciech Maziarski also reported newstrikes or partial strikes at the Cegielski turbine works inPoznan, the Huta Warszawa steel mill in Warsaw and the RailroadConstruction Enterprise of Szczecin.   A spokesman for Huta Warszawa mill, technical director StanislawZalesny, said about 50 people tried to mount a strike but itfailed. Straus said he had no information about any stoppages atCegielski or the Szczecin railroad enterprise.   There was no police interference as workers marched around theGdansk shipyard carrying Polish national flags and took over themain gate at 8:35 a.m. Late this morning, however, riot policecordoned off approaches to the shipyard.   Strikers chanted Solidarity slogans and posted strike banners onthe shipyard fence, helping some supporters who had been locked outto scramble over the gate.   A short time later, Solidarity national chairman Lech Walesaarrived.   ``We must fight for reforms. We must fight for Solidarity. Thereis no other way,'' Walesa exhorted strikers in a 20-minute rally atthe gate.   ``Everything is closed and the whole shipyard is on strike,''Walesa said later by telephone from his Gdansk home.   He said the enthusiasm of the young strikers surprised him.``This youth we have there is just incredible.''   Walesa blamed the strikes on authorities, whom he said haverefused to engage in dialogue with workers.   ``I wanted to avoid strikes,'' he said. ``We shouldn't bestriking. We should be working. But there was no other choice. ...We are still waiting for serious talks.''   None of the shipyard's towering cranes appeared to be operating,and a foreman speaking through a fence stated that all departmentswere shut down.   Workers could be seen strolling, taking naps or perching onfences and walls around the yard. Straus confirmed that thegovernment considered the shipyard on strike.   ``If you work only eight hours a day, you make 40,000 zlotys($89) a month, and that's not enough to make a living,'' said oneman in his mid-20s, asked why he joined the strike.   The shipyard, where Solidarity began eight years ago this month,also was the scene of a strike in May that ended inconclusively. InPoland, striking workers generally go to their plants but do notwork.   Not since the labor unrest that led to the 1981 militarycrackdown on Solidarity have authorities had to confront strikes onsuch a scale. Wages are lagging far behind 60 percent inflation,which is aggravated by average 40 price increases.   The government-controlled media has called the strikes illegaland stressed their rising cost to the economy. Coal is Poland'sleading export and a major source of hard currency to service its$39 billion foreign debt.   The government, which has refused to negotiate with Solidarity,has not stated how it intends to deal with the strikes.   Solidarity, only independent labor federation ever allowed inthe Soviet bloc, was founded in the Gdansk shipyard in 1980 after anationwide strike wave. It was outlawed in October 1982.   Labor unrest stemming in part from government price increaseshave three times toppled governments in communist post-war Poland:in 1956, 1970 and 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
