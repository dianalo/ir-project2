Then we piled Annie inour car, headed back to Kentucky, and left the museum bereftof the breed. Clumbers are not the only thing of which theDog Museum is bereft: the list includes kuvaszok (except forthe one on a pewter key ring in the gift shop), properlabeling and available guides (human, written or audio). Itis, after all, just a pup of a museum, but a pup of superbconfiguration and great promise. Given time and the rightdiet ($), it very likely will develop into a champion.   Devoted to the collection, preservation and exhibition ofworks of art and literature related to &quot;canis familiaris&quot;,the Dog Museum first opened in New York in 1982. In 1987 itmoved into Jarville House, a magnificent Greek Revivalbuilding in Queeny Park, 25 miles west of downtown St. Louis,and invited people and dogs inside for a look. Last fall themuseum opened a grand, well-lighted, air-conditioned,beautifully decorated addition. (Paid for in most part by$1.2 million from county funds -- a government expense thatdid not go unnoticed by editors, writers of letters to theeditor, cartoonists and voters during last fall's countyelection.) The expansion and refurbishment involved newcarpet, which, alas, brought on new rules. Annie could notget past the front door of Jarville House. Four magnificentblack cast -- concrete retrievers and a fantastic carouseldog guard the entry.</LP><TEXT>   This deprivation did not offend Annie, whose perception ofculture extends only inches past her nose. There are about200,000 dogs in St. Louis County, and a good many of themapparently have visited Queeny Park. While Annie sniffedtheir vestiges outside we looked inside.   The largest individual art collection given to the museumso far came from the estate of Marie Moore, a Virginian whomajored in mastiffs. In oil (including Richard Ansdell's &quot;ThePoacher&quot;), watercolor and bronze, as well as on hat pins andearrings, her mastiffs are the cornerstone of the museum'sholdings.   Since Ms. Moore's initial gift, there have been severalother good-sized collections donated, as well as individualgifts, so there is a somewhat diverse representation ofbreeds. The main exhibition room displays schipperkes,pointers, whippets, a bull terrier, coonhounds and othersalong with a collection of figurines by Amory C. Simonsdonated by the American Museum of Natural History.   Those products of the no man's land between art andscience exemplify one of the major goals of this museum: toacquire dog collections before they get dispersed or ditched.   The most spectacular pieces currently on exhibit are apair of pointer paintings by Jean-Baptiste Oudry, an18th-century French artist. My enchantment with Oudry'spointers may have been influenced by the fact that one ofthem looks a lot like a pointer I once knew. I felt the sameattachment to some wonderful bronze coonhounds, but then, mydogs have always been hunters.   The museum's collection is heavy with 19th-century Englishdog art, a reflection of the English Victorians' urge to owndogs and pay painters to immortalize them. Collectors todaymay expect to pay from $2,000 to $70,000 or more for suchpaintings, according to William Secord, who put together theinitial Dog Museum collection when he was curator during itstime in New York. (Mr. Secord now specializes in dog art athis New York gallery, at 52 East 76th St., where he recentlyopened a new exhibit, &quot;British Dog Painting, 1840-1940.&quot;)   A big chunk of the Dog Museum's collection is in storageuntil April while &quot;Snoopy, the Universal Dog&quot; fills thegalleries of the new building. Even non-beagle people tend tothink of Snoopy as MY dog, and his stint at the museum hasgarnered good publicity. A more extensive and diverseexposure of the permanent collection will give the museum achance to expound on the unique place man's best friend hasin art and history. In the meantime, the museum's collectionof dog literature, both antique and current, is available forbrowsing.   The new building includes a tile-floored community roomwhere dogs (well-behaved and with their human in tow) areallowed. Annie joined us there to look at some contemporarydog art, including a poignant photograph of a mutt (a breedscarce in dog art) and works by members of the museum'sregistry of dog artists (who will happily paint, sketch,watercolor, draw or sculpt your dog; the museum does notquote prices).   Later, while Annie snored, we watched an 18-minuteAmerican Kennel Club tape about the clumber spaniel's properconfiguration (Annie lacks a bit in this department -- she'smerely a &quot;pet quality&quot; clumber) and sterling qualities(&quot;dignified&quot; and &quot;enthusiastic&quot; -- no mention of digging orsnoring or shedding). The museum's extensive tape libraryincludes a complete set of AKC breed tapes plus a goodlyselection of how-to's and documentaries.   Each Sunday afternoon the museum sponsors show-and-tell inthe community room, usually focusing on lesser-known breedsor pet care. February's schedule includes the Bedlington andNorwich terriers and the Havanese.   When I told a dog-nut friend of mine who lives in NewJersey that I was going to visit the Dog Museum in St. Louisshe said, &quot;Oh, it's such a pity they put it out there whereno one can see it.&quot; The St. Louis tourist bureau people wouldlike for my friend to know that one-third of this nation'sresidents (who own, presumably, one-third of the nation's54.5 million dogs) live within a day's drive of St. Louis.More and more visit every day, leaving their, er, mark on theplace. Annie may not be able to stand the excitement of asecond trip.   ---   Ms. King is a free-lance writer based in Henderson, Ky.</TEXT></DOC>
