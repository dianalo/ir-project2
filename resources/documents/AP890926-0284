Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.'s 1989 Reserve Disclosures Survey of 244public petroleum companies said the increases are the first suchsignificant moves since 1985.   ``While this is far from a sign that the U.S. oil and gasindustry is about to return to boom times, it does indicate thatmany companies have successfully adapted to today's low priceenvironment,'' said Victor A. Burk, managing director of theaccounting firm's oil and gas industry services.   Burk said capital expenditures to acquire, explore or developoil and gas properties increased in 1988 by 53 percent to $24.6billion. Capital expenditures fell more than 70 percent from 1984through 1987.   In 1988, $5.5 billion of the spending increase _ 65 percent _was related to surveyed companies acquiring Tenneco's oil and gasproperties. With the Tenneco deal, the acquisitions of provedproperties reached the highest levels since 1984.   U.S. gas reserves also increased for the first time since 1984to rise to 103.9 trillion cubic feet (TCF). In 1987, gas reserveshad dropped for the fourth consecutive year, to 103 TCF.   But in 1988, petroleum companies were able to replace more thanhalf their oil and gas production through discoveries of newreserves.   Burk said the findings show an industry making careful decisionsabout its future. ``Management is being very selective in choosingtheir development sites,'' he said.   U.S. exploration and production companies are repositioning byconsolidating operations, stressing technological innovation,improving operating efficiencies, redirecting exploration anddevelopment activities and investments, and buying and sellingreserves, he said.   Burk said companies ``continued to drill their best prospects''and reported the lowest finding cost for new wells of the 1980s at$7.70 per barrel.   ``I think we will continue to see improvements in 1989,'' Burksaid. ``Both oil and gas have continued to show improvements over1988.   Burk said since Arthur Andersen began compiling data for theforecasts 10 years ago, many firms have been acquired or simplygone out of business. In the past five years, he said 36 companieshave dropped from the list of 244 public companies.   ``I think overall, these are good things _ more positives thannegatives,'' Burk said. ``It certainly will have a positive effectin the amount of money people will spend in drilling.''   Meanwhile, Enron Corp. Tuesday released a study that forecast anatural gas market of 19 to 21 TCF by the year 2000. ArthurAndersen showed that the leading public companies produced 9.4 TCFof natural gas in 1988.   Enron officials said more gas-fired power plants are likely tobe built because of the Bush administration's proposedenvironmental incentives for natural gas use.</TEXT></DOC>
