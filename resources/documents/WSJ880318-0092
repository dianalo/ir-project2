Roberts (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MEGA BRRS GPO </CO><IN> TNM TEL PUB </IN><DATELINE> BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The battle for control of Media General Inc. turned nasty, with companies controlled by Burt Sugarman claiming in a countersuit that agents of Media General have been spying on him to help thwart his $1.57 billion takeover offer.    Mr. Sugarman, whose companies own 10.1% of Media General Class A common, also said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that he will launch a proxy fight to win three seats on the nine-member Media General board at its May 20 annual shareholder meeting. The remaining six seats are elected by holders of Media General's powerful Class B stock, which is 70% controlled by the Bryan family. Two of Media General's top officers are members of the Bryan family.    The lawsuit by Mr. Sugarman's Barris Industries Inc. and Giant Group Ltd., filed in federal court in Richmond, Va., claims that the Bryans and other individual defendants &quot;have been spending and are continuing to spend substantial corporate funds on private investigators in at least three states in an effort to harass the plaintiffs and their employees.&quot;    In Richmond, a spokesman for Media General declined to comment on the allegations specifically, but called the suit meritless, and an &quot;obvious reaction&quot; to its own suit filed against Mr. Sugarman in the same court on Monday, alleging violations of securities laws.    In its suit, Media General asked the court to order the sale of Mr. Sugarman's current holdings and bar him from acquiring additional Media General shares and from soliciting proxies. It also asked that he be barred from trying to arrange financing for further Media General stock purchases.    The Sugarman group's suit claims that &quot;private-investigator types,&quot; have conducted &quot;intrusive surveillance&quot; of Mr. Sugarman. Mr. Sugarman declined to elaborate, but Beverly Hills police say that on Feb. 12 they received reports from Giant Group that items in Mr. Sugarman's office were found &quot;disturbed&quot; after what police called a &quot;suspicious individual&quot; was seen at the office last month.    The suit seeks to have the Barris and Giant Group offer considered only by directors representing Media General's Class A stock, and to have all shareholders vote on the offer as a single class. As previously reported, the board of Media General, a publishing and broadcasting concern, has said it wouldn't consider the merger proposal, made late last month, because of the Bryans's opposition.    Mr. Sugarman has asserted that his merger proposal doesn't require a two-thirds Class B approval because of a clause in Media General's charter modifying the existing voting arrangement if Media General is the surviving company in certain proposed mergers. Under the $61.50-a-share offer by Mr. Sugarman's companies, Media General would be the surviving entity.    Meanwhile, Mr. Sugarman, who is a Hollywood producer as well as chairman of Barris and Giant, said he hopes to win a Media General board seat through the proxy solicitation. He listed Dallas investor Harold Simmons, chairman of NL Industries Inc., as a second slate member, and said the third candidate would be identified later.    Representatives of Mr. Sugarman also have had discussions with certain Media General shareholders regarding the value of Media General's assets and potential buyers of those assets. Mr. Sugarman disclosed the discussions, and his planned proxy fight, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    The shareholders contacted include Harvey Sandler and Barry Lewis of Sandler Associates, a New York money manager; and Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American Continental Corp., a Phoenix, Ariz., financial services, hotel management, land development and housing construction concern. Messrs. Sandler and Lewis together control about 313,200 of the Class A shares, and Mr. Keating controls about 1.3 million shares, the filing said.    In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, shares of Media General closed yesterday at $47.125, up $1.125. Shares of Giant, a cement concern traded on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $22.125, down 12.5 cents. Barris, a television game-show concern that produces the &quot;Gong Show&quot; and &quot;Dating Game&quot; programs, closed in national over-the-counter trading at $10.25 a share, up 25 cents.    In its suit, Media General accused Mr. Sugarman and his associates of &quot;predatory conduct&quot; and of making &quot;a blatant attempt to prey on stockholders.&quot; Mr. Sugarman's real intention is to extract so-called greenmail payments for his stake or force Media General into the arms of a &quot;white knight,&quot; the suit said. It called the offer a &quot;bogus effort&quot; and said Mr. Sugarman hadn't disclosed any details about his ability to finance the proposed acquisition.    Moreover, the company charged that Mr. Sugarman had embarked on a program to &quot;artificially inflate and manipulate&quot; Media General's stock price after he incurred &quot;dramatic paper losses&quot; in the stock market crash last October.    Mr. Sugarman declined to comment on the allegations in Media General's suit. </TEXT></DOC>
