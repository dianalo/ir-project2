This information documents the chemical variabilityof the lignite fly ashes by geographic region. There is a different relationshipbetween grains rich in SiO/sub 2/ and Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and in the Na/sub2/O content of the grains in lignite derived fly ashes. There is alsoa direct relationship between grains rich in CaO and the MgO and SO/sub3/ content of the grains in lignite derived fly ashes.</TEXT></DOC>
