US Sprint is a Kansas City, Mo.-based long-distance telecommunications joint venture of GTE Corp., Stamford, Conn., and United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo.    In addition, US Sprint said it will expand its international calling services to include West Germany, the Netherlands, Greece, Switzerland, Belgium, Singapore and Israel.    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. reduced long-distance rates at the start of the year by about 3.5% annually after being ordered to do so by the Federal Communications Commission. The rate cuts reflect an earlier FCC order to local phone companies to reduce connection charges to long-distance companies.    MCI Communications Corp. followed last week, announcing it will trim its interstate long-distance rates an average 3.5%, starting March 1. </TEXT></DOC>
