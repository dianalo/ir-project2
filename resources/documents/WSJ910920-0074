Not since the Chrysler Corp. bailout has Detroit made sucha big push in Congress. The auto industry has poured morethan $10 million into the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, anorganization set up solely to defeat proposed legislationmandating much tougher fuel-efficiency standards.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This legislation is as potentially damaging as any I'veever seen,&quot; says William Noack, communications director forGeneral Motors Corp.   Launched last March, CVC bills itself as a &quot;grass-roots&quot;group with more than 400 members. But there's nothinglow-rent about the organization, which has offices in agleaming building just a few blocks from the White House andpays its president, Diane Steed, $12,000 a month. Ms. Steedwas administrator of the National Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration during the Reagan administration.   While CVC won't disclose much about its budget or funding,Ms. Steed confirms that her organization's chief financialbackers are GM, Chrysler and Ford Motor Co. &quot;We don't thinkthere's anything sinister about an industry-fundedcoalition,&quot; she says.   The legislation CVC is targeting, which was introduced byDemocratic Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada, would order a 40%increase in fuel-economy standards by the year 2001. Thecoalition says the legislation would result in a massivedownsizing of automobiles and a proliferation of smaller,more dangerous cars. The group has been running televisionadvertisements showing a Department of Transportation crashtest in which a 2,300-pound car, which gets 41 miles pergallon, is creamed by a 4,000-pound car getting 23 mpg.   The ads, as well as Ms. Steed's frequent publicappearances around the country, have inflamed supporters ofthe Bryan bill, particularly Joan Claybrook, who headed NHTSAduring the Carter administration. The two dueling formerNHTSA chiefs have accused each other of lying about thesafety consequences of the Bryan measure.   Ms. Claybrook says Ms. Steed is &quot;misleading&quot; the public.&quot;You do not have to make smaller cars to meet theserequirements,&quot; she insists. But Ms. Steed lambasts Ms.Claybrook for &quot;back-pedaling on her past positions,&quot; andeagerly hands out a fact sheet that includes a quote from Ms.Claybrook at a 1980 congressional hearing in which sheexpressed concern about &quot;the increasing numbers of subcompactcars in crashes.&quot;   Ms. Claybrook, now president of Public Citizen, thelobbying arm of Ralph Nader's organization, says Ms. Steed is&quot;trading on her federal office to earn money from the autoindustry. It's very troubling.&quot; When Ms. Steed left thegovernment in 1989, she started her own &quot;automotive safetyand regulatory consulting firm,&quot; as she describes it on herresume. Her consulting has included highly paid appearancesas an expert witness for auto manufacturers inproduct-liability cases.   Ms. Steed defends the propriety of her industry income andsays Ms. Claybrook &quot;has a lot of nerve&quot; to criticize her whenMs. Claybrook herself headed a group that received fundingfrom railroad interests. (Ms. Claybrook was co-chairman ofCitizens for Reliable and Safe Highways, which opposes tripletrailer trucks and received some railroad-industry funding.However, she wasn't paid for her work with the group.) At theend of this month, Ms. Steed and Ms. Claybrook will squareoff in public for the first time, before an audience ofinsurance executives in Washington.   But the Steed-Claybrook feud is only one skirmish in anincreasingly bitter and expensive lobbying war overfuel-economy legislation. Last year, the auto industry drewcriticism for its tactics in defeating a similar measureintroduced by Sen. Bryan as part of clean-air legislation.The Big Three hired an outside lobbying firm in Washington tomount a &quot;grass-roots&quot; lobbying effort in Sen. Bryan's stateto oppose the fuel measure. A few of the groups whose nameswere used by the organization, &quot;Nevadans for Fair FuelEconomy,&quot; complained they were never told that the autoindustry was behind it. Sen. Bryan accused the auto companiesof coming into Nevada under &quot;false colors.&quot;   Clarence Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety, anotherNader group, complains that &quot;CVC is another industry frontorganization, but on a grander scale.&quot; Mr. Ditlow says CVCtried to hide its industry roots and didn't list the BigThree auto manufacturers on its initial membership roster.Ron Defore, CVC's spokesman, says Mr. Ditlow is &quot;way offbase. We are up front about where the funding comes from.&quot;The most recent membership lists distributed by CVC doinclude GM, Ford and Chrysler.   CVC was the brainchild of a Washington lobbying andpublic-relations firm, E. Bruce Harrison andamp; Co., which wasretained for $500,000 by the Motor Vehicle ManufacturersAssociation, the Washington trade association supported bythe Big Three. Mr. Defore, a Harrison executive who workedwith Ms. Steed at NHTSA, began signing up members -- mostlyauto-related companies and groups that depend on heavyvehicles, including the American Farm Bureau Federation andthe Livestock Marketing Association. The CVC coalition hasgrown to include a number of health and safety groups. &quot;It'sdone a good job of illuminating the negative consequences ofthe Bryan bill,&quot; says GM's Mr. Noack.   Bryan supporters also say CVC has been getting its messageout. Nancy Hirsh, director of the Energy ConservationCoalition, a coalition of 20 environmental and consumergroups that support the Bryan bill, is trying to send itsactivists everywhere CVC goes. &quot;We want to show that we'rethe real people power, not auto-company designees,&quot; she says.Recently, the environmental coalition, which includes theSierra Club and Greenpeace, was joined by UAW New Directions,a dissident group of auto workers. (The United Auto Workersunion itself supports the auto industry's position againstthe Bryan bill.)   But the auto-industry forces still outmuscle them. BesidesCVC, the Big Three employ more than 50 staffers inWashington, as well as a huge retinue of pricey outsidelobbyists, including firms headed by such former top WhiteHouse aides as William Timmons, Anne Wexler and KennethDuberstein. Last spring, Chrysler, Ford and GM jointly hosteda delegation of 41 members of Congress in Detroit to discussindustry problems, particularly higher fuel-efficiencystandards. That visit was preceded by a private audience forthe chairmen of the three companies -- Robert Stempel of GM,Harold Poling of Ford and Lee Iacocca of Chrysler -- withPresident Bush, who has threatened to veto the Bryan bill.   Detroit's purse strings have also been loose when it comesto political contributions. The industry and related tradeorganizations have poured more than $20 million into thecampaigns of federal lawmakers since 1984, when thefuel-efficiency issue was first seriously debated. Michigan'stwo Democratic senators, Donald Riegle and Carl Levin, havebeen, predictably, the top beneficiaries, with each manreceiving more than $80,000 in auto-industry largesse. Mr.Riegle led a filibuster against Sen. Bryan's proposal lastyear, and both he and Sen. Levin are likely to be keyopponents again this year.</TEXT></DOC>
