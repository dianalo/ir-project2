Actor Alan Midgette impersonated Mr. Warhol in the 1960s -- at the artist's behest -- touring colleges just to see how long it would take people to recognize him as an impostor. In the past month, Mr. Midgette again has begun dressing up like Mr. Warhol, in jeans, white face powder and an unkempt silver wig. He has been showing up at parties Mr. Warhol might have attended were he alive. Mr. Midgette says Hollywood producers are looking for someone to play Mr. Warhol in a movie, and he wants the part. (He is also hand-copying famous Warhol paintings, which he hopes to sell for as much as $5,000 apiece.)    Don't be shocked, either, if you should see Andy Warhol on television pitching pimple cream or automobiles. Broadway producer Lewis Allen is nearly finished constructing a lifelike, computerized Andy Warhol robot, whose face and hands were taken directly from molds of Mr. Warhol's body (living, not dead). Mr. Allen says the robot could have a highly lucrative career as a commercial spokesman but will first be programmed to speak and answer questions on stage in a production called &quot;Andy Warhol Overexposed: A No-Man Show.&quot;    Overexposed is the word. Brace yourself for Andy-mania, the commercialization of his paintings, movies, household furnishings, memorabilia and detritus. There are to be licensed Andy Warhol watches, Andy Warhol sportswear and Andy Warhol shower curtains, as well as Andy Warhol books, exhibits, collector plates. So get ready for the many people who will be trying to make much money off a dead man giggling down from pop-art heaven.    &quot;Andy loved fame above all,&quot; says Ultra Violet, a longtime Warhol friend who appeared in several of his films and is currently writing her memoirs. &quot;He would love all this because he loved having his name up front.&quot; As for Warhol impostors, says Ultra Violet, &quot;the more the merrier is how Andy would feel, trust me.&quot;    Even before his death last year following gall-bladder surgery, the pale, workaholic son of an immigrant Czechoslovak coal miner was witnessing a reassessment of his career. Through the '70s, he watched the stock of fellow pop artists like Roy Lichtenstein soar, while griping that prices for his own paintings were rising modestly and that museum shows were few and far between. His most famous utterance had been that the electronic age would make everyone a celebrity for 15 minutes, and it was beginning to look as if his own fame was petering out.    But by 1986, he was resurgent. The Larry Gagosian Gallery exhibited &quot;paintings&quot; Mr. Warhol had produced by urinating on canvases painted metallic copper. They were hardly as popular as his Campbell's Soup cans or his Marilyn Monroe silk screens, but they sold out at prices approaching $200,000. Shortly before Mr. Warhol's death, a painting he did of a car crash sold at auction for $660,000, and several of his works reportedly changed hands at $1 million.    The real mania began to build after Mr. Warhol's untimely death in February last year, at the age of 58. It should reach fever pitch at a 10-day auction in New York starting April 23. In his will, Mr. Warhol left most of his estate -- valued at $75 million to $100 million -- to a foundation benefiting the visual arts. The bequest includes real estate, art and Interview magazine. When certain Warhol assets had to be sold, Mr. Warhol's business manager and executor, Fred Hughes, arranged for Sotheby's to auction the artist's enormous and eccentric holdings of furniture, art and kitsch, knick-knacks being one of his passions.    The London-based auction firm normally rejects any item worth less than $1,000, but Sotheby's recognizes a media event when it sees one. To attract reporters and collectors, Sotheby's emphasized the weirdness (everything from Bakelite bracelets to a $500,000 Jasper Johns painting), volume (10,000 items), and price (a Campbell's Soup bowl inscribed &quot;Andy,&quot; worth maybe $50) in the auction.    Thus, the pop artist who made museum art of soup cans ended up getting a prestigious auction house for the first time to sell cookie jars, high-school rings and plastic Flintstones watches. The catalog, a six-volume, eight-pound package priced at $95, is even being sold in bookstores, which is also a first.    And so, even though skeptical observers say that only the art deco furniture, certain contemporary paintings and a few collectibles are worth all the fuss, much of New York may attend at some point, so as not to miss a genuine event. &quot;The whole world is going to the auction,&quot; says Ultra Violet. &quot;The art people, the antique people, the rock'n'roll people, the '60s people. I'll be there every day.&quot;    Many of the collectors competing for a minor memento or for rare sharkskin-covered art deco furniture will be hoping to turn a profit in the end. Antique dealer Vito Giallo, whose tiny shop was part of Mr. Warhol's daily shopping rounds for years, is hoping to buy back &quot;as much as I can&quot; and resell it for more money. Cindy Fanelli, who sells antique timepieces on Madison Avenue, will attend just to see how high prices go for Mr. Warhol's 313 watches. &quot;It's a selling point,&quot; says Ms. Fanelli. &quot;We might be able to say, 'Andy Warhol's watch just like this sold for $5,000 at Sotheby's and I'm selling it for only $2,000.'&quot;    The auction alone is expected to raise between $10 million and $40 million, most of which goes to the foundation, but there are many other Warhol ventures. Just this week, the Andy Warhol watch was introduced by Movado in Basel, Switzerland, for $13,500, many times the auction estimate for any watch actually owned by the artist. The unusual watch, in a limited edition of 250, was designed by Mr. Warhol. It has five rectangular faces linked like a bracelet and decorated with black-and-white Warhol photographs of New York buildings.    Roger Schlaifer, an Atlanta businessman who won exclusive licensing rights to Warhol images, hopes to make Mr. Warhol as pervasive as Cabbage Patch dolls, for which he also held the marketing rights. &quot;This has tremendous possibilities,&quot; says Mr. Schlaifer, who got to know Mr. Warhol in 1985 when he commissioned the artist to make portraits of Cabbage Patch Kids for Schlaifer Nance andamp; Co. headquarters. The licensing arrangement was made with the estate after Mr. Warhol's death.    A Warhol calendar is in the works, but Mr. Schlaifer also envisions Warhol posters, note cards, bathmats, shopping bags, ties, handbags and scarfs. There are talks with Bloomingdale's about a housewares line. Japan and Europe, where Mr. Warhol is immensely popular, are target markets for virtually everything.    &quot;Someone said at Andy's memorial service that he wanted to be reincarnated as a ring on Liz Taylor's finger,&quot; says Mr. Schlaifer. &quot;I hope someday we have Tiffany as a licensee and we can sell a Warhol ring. . . . Without question, he is one of the two most famous artists of the 20th century, along with Picasso. We think the magic $1 billion {in retail sales} is definitely in the ballpark in the next five years.&quot;    Warhol stuff of a literary sort is also in production. Art critic David Bourdon, a longtime friend, is finishing a fat, illustrated book on Mr. Warhol's life and art for highbrow publisher Harry Abrams. Half a dozen other tributes and reminiscences are in the works, including Ultra Violet's and one by former Interview editor Bob Colacello. Next fall, Warner Books is publishing Mr. Warhol's &quot;diaries,&quot; transcripts of conversations from a man who preferred the tape recorder (he called it &quot;my wife&quot;) to the typewriter.    Movie fans will get a chance to see such Warhol classics as &quot;Vinyl&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Cowboys&quot; at a monthlong film retrospective at the Whitney Museum, beginning in late April. They can also buy or rent the newly re-released videos of Warhol movies &quot;Flesh,&quot; &quot;Trash&quot; and &quot;Heat.&quot;    Mr. Warhol's art itself will get plenty of exposure, including many shows in New York galleries. A monumental retrospective is set for the Museum of Modern Art in February and will then travel to Europe.    Scholars and critics are just beginning to evaluate Mr. Warhol in the history of art, says curator Charles Stuckey of Chicago's Art Institute, which will also hold the major retrospective. &quot;I think everybody has this feeling that Mr. Warhol may have been one of the greatest artists ever, but they aren't exactly sure why,&quot; says Mr. Stuckey. &quot;He was such an irritant. He put down every serious theory of art and was flagrantly popular. I think he'll always be controversial.&quot;    So, of course, is the hype. Some worry that it will trivialize the artist and his work, but then how would that be possible? Mr. Warhol himself was media-loving and money-mad. &quot;Good business is the best art,&quot; he once said. </TEXT></DOC>
