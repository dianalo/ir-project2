Nomani   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/13/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><LP>   CHICAGO -- There are horse races, dog races, even turtleraces. But duck races?   Suddenly, they're all the rage. Duck dashes have recentlybeen held on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers and theElizabeth Park Canal outside Detroit. Later this month, anestimated 50,000 ducks are expected to compete here on theChicago River.</LP><TEXT>   But don't expect thousands of sore losers to fly away and,well, befoul the festive event. These duck races, a new typeof charity fund-raiser, use fist-sized, nontoxic,yellow-rubber ducks sporting black sunglasses and painted-onsmiles.   The child-abuse unit of the Illinois Masonic MedicalCenter is sponsoring Chicago's giant birdbath. Organizershere and elsewhere rent the racing ducks from leasingcompanies and then round up sponsors to adopt the birds,usually for $5 a duck. Each duck is numbered on itsunderbelly, and that and other information is fed into acomputer program called Quack Track.   For the Chicago race, the web-footed racers will be dumpedoff the Michigan Avenue bridge and propelled along the riverby fire-department water cannons. Their top speed usually isnine miles an hour. The first duck that pops out of a chuteat the finish line wins. Among the prizes: a paddle boat.   The race &quot;is pretty strange,&quot; concedes George Broustis, anadministrative aide at the Metropolitan Water ReclamationDistrict here. City officials say it's the weirdest riverevent since folks began dyeing the river green each St.Patrick's Day.   Charity groups are all aflutter over the fund-raiser.&quot;It's so warm and fuzzy,&quot; says Susan Harris, a race organizerat Illinois Masonic. Still, the ducks ruffled feathers inSanta Rosa, Calif., when environmentalists opposed a race onthe Russian River. They feared the ducks would float into thePacific Ocean, 13 miles downstream, and end up choking sealions.   Great American Duck Races, a Phoenix, Ariz., company thatleases the ducks, says the number of races it supplies issoaring -- to 38 last year from eight in 1988. This year'stotal should top 100, and 105 are scheduled for next year.   For the Chicago race, the unresolved question is how todump that many ducks into the river all at the same time.Some ideas already nixed: by dump truck, helicopter, laundrychute or cement mixer. &quot;The ducks might get smooshed,&quot;worries Dawn Cielec, a race volunteer from Motorola Inc., acorporate sponsor.</TEXT></DOC>
