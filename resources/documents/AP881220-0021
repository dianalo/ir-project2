The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's3,000 Sandamp;Ls, on Monday sent the broad outlines of the proposal to theTreasury Department, which is formulating the incoming Bushadministration's plans for dealing with hundreds of insolventsavings institutions, agency spokesman Karl Hoyle said.   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, in a speech to a group calledthe National Housing Conference, proposed what he called a``reinsurance agency'' for all federally insured financialinstitutions.   On an unrelated topic, Wall also said the bank board is offeringto make foreclosed properties from failed savings institutionsavailable to house the homeless in a half dozen cities.   The bank board's insurance fund, the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., has been paying for a record number of Sandamp;L rescuesthis year primarily through promissory notes pledging future incomefrom an assessment on still-operating institutions.   Wall has argued previously that the fees paid by Sandamp;Ls to theFSLIC, as well as by banks and credit unions to separate insurancefunds, were meant to cover a ``normal'' level of failures, not the``catastrophic'' level of the current thrift crisis.   Through Monday, regulators said they have resolved the cases of159 insolvent thrifts this year. More than 400 insolvent Sandamp;Ls remainopen and hundreds of others are close to insolvency.   The reinsurance agency would oversee three insurance funds _ forbanks, Sandamp;Ls and credit unions. It could collect premiums from allthree, spending them when one of the funds got in trouble. It alsocould serve as the mechanism for further borrowing to pay for thethrift crisis or as the conduit for any money Congress wanted tospend on the cleanup.   Bank board member Lawrence White, in an interview, said theproposal leaves open who will pay for the Sandamp;L cleanup and whether anew agency's expenditures would be counted toward the budget deficit.   ``I don't think it is intended to be a back door way of gettingthem (banks and credit unions) to pay for the FSLIC's currentproblems,'' White said. ``The concept is both a funding mechanismand a forward looking means of dealing with catastrophic costs'' inthe future.   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported in weekend editions thatthe Reagan administration, in its 1990 budget, will acknowledge forthe first time that some taxpayer money must be spent on the thriftindustry problem.   An administration source, who declined to be named, told TheAssociated Press that the Treasury Department estimates the cost ofrestoring the thrift industry to health at $60 billion to $75billion if interest rates remain unchanged and as high as $105billion if interest rates increase by two percentage points. Thefigures were first reported by The Washington Post.   Regarding the proposal to use Sandamp;L properties for the homeless,Hoyle said the bank board is talking with six or seven cities inTexas and in the North and Midwest. He declined to identify them.   Hoyle said the bank board would lend the properties _ in somecases commercial buildings near soup kitchens _ to municipalgovernments, which in turn would pay to administer them as temporaryshelters.   ``That ball is in their court at this juncture. They have todecide if they have the funds,'' he said. ``We would like to get itdone in the winter when this housing would be most useful to thehomeless.''   Discussions with the cities started several months ago, Hoylesaid. Another effort, to persuade private groups to purchaseforeclosed homes from the bank board and rehabilitate them for poorfamilies, began about a year ago, he said.   Wall disclosed the homeless initiative on the same day thatPresident-elect Bush, in announcing the appointment of Rep. JackKemp, R-N.Y., as secretary of Housing and Urban Development, saidhis administration would seek innovative solutions to the problem ofhomelessness.</TEXT></DOC>
