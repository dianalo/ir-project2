That would ease the tight stockpile situation that has helped fuel a 15% rise in cash prices from last year's levels. The soybean contract for current delivery fell 10.75 cents a bushel, to $6.0625.    Some traders expect further downward pressure on soybean prices today because the Agriculture Department announced after the close of trading that it had slightly raised its estimate of this year's U.S. soybean stockpile. Most traders had expected the government to trim its stockpile estimate in the wake of brisk export sales.    The department, which issues a monthly soybean, corn and wheat stockpile forecast, said it expects soybean stockpiles at the end of this year's harvest to total 315 million bushels instead of the 300 million bushels anticipated by traders. The department's estimate is 10 million bushels higher than its February projection.    &quot;This could be a mild negative for the market,&quot; said Mario Balletto, a soybean analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., New York.    The department didn't change its stockpile estimate of 1.28 billion bushels of wheat and 4.12 billion bushels of corn.    U.S. soybean traders are especially jittery about negative news because Brazil and Argentina are beginning to unleash an unusually large soybean harvest onto world markets, where they are the major competitors of the U.S. Some analysts expect South America to take as much as 20% more business away from the U.S. than it did last year.    Until yesterday, soybean prices had been largely supported by a consensus among traders and analysts that federal-crop programs would dissuade U.S. farmers from planting more than two million additional acres to soybeans to the 57.4 million acres planted last year.    The reasoning was that Midwest farmers, who predominately grow corn and soybeans, wouldn't be interested in giving up corn production, which is heavily subsidized, to plant more soybeans, which aren't subsidized.    Yet some traders and analysts are apparently growing nervous that the rise in cash soybean prices might spur Southeast soybean farmers, who grow little corn, to put more idled acreage under plow.    Analysts said a survey by one major trading firm indicates that as much as 64 million acres might be planted to soybeans this spring. Rumors have another survey pegging 61.5 million acres.    Though most analysts are sticking with their original estimates, speculation about those surveys &quot;watered down at least some of the enthusiasm&quot; in the soybean pits, said Steve Freed, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago.    Prices of wheat and corn futures slipped amid heavy fund selling and a lack of news.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Copper prices staged a bold comeback from the previous day's lows. The May contract finished at 97.25 cents a pound, up 6.25 cents. &quot;It's a bull market until the front-month prices fall even to or below the distant months,&quot; said James Kneafsey, president of Cambridge Commodities Corp., Cambridge, Mass. Normally contracts for distant delivery trade higher than those with a near-term settlement date. Analysts also speculated that a large open interest -- the number of contracts calling for delivery -- in the March contract might be leading to price distortions in that contract's price because of the small supply of deliverable stocks. While the &quot;squeeze&quot; is occurring primarily in London, the effects do get transfered to the U.S., they said. New York's Commodity Exchange has 13,715 short tons of copper on hand for delivery against the March contract, or enough to settle 1,097 contracts. But as of Tuesday's close, the exchange said there were 4,909 contracts calling for delivery. The last trading date for the contract is March 29.    ENERGY: Crude-oil prices were up a bit following an early rally. The market opened higher on the heels of the latest American Petroleum Institute report, which found a drop in gasoline and distillate stocks. The current-delivery crude contract hit a high of $15.65 a barrel, before settling at $15.49 a barrel, up four cents. Crude futures were off the day's highs because there were no new fundamentals to support follow-through buying, analysts said. &quot;Nothing warrants the market breaking out,&quot; said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York. The market also may have reacted to industry reports showing a build up of European crude stocks in February, an analyst said. </TEXT></DOC>
