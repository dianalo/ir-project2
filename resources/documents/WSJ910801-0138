But behind the scenes, ad executives say,such poaching is common -- and becoming more so.   Clients report that their phones are ringing off the hookas agency executives try to convince them that they shoulddump their current agency, or at least listen to a newagency's brilliant ideas. With ad budgets plummeting and noturnaround in sight, the agencies insist they have no choice.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's no more natural growth {in the ad industry}, sothe only way to grow your agency is to make somebody else'ssmaller. It's a share fight,&quot; says John M. Connors Jr., chiefexecutive officer of Boston's Hill, Holliday, Connors,Cosmopulos.   Adds Carl Spielvogel, chairman of Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Co.'sBacker Spielvogel: &quot;There is no question that with adexpenditures flattening out, there is much more hunting.&quot;   Ketchum Advertising several months ago launched what itcalls the &quot;Achilles Heel Program,&quot; in part to pinpointcompetitors' weaknesses so it can woo their clients. Whenpursuing those clients, it doesn't stop at phone calls: Itinvests money in research and comes up with a full-blownpresentation. That go-for-the-jugular approach would havebeen unheard of even a year or two ago. &quot;Some {clients} getoffended and say, `How presumptuous]'&quot; concedes Kevin Allen,a senior vice president. &quot;But many are saying: `Okay, come onin. Let's talk.'&quot;   In some cases, advertisers have created a climate ripe forpoachers by switching agencies without ever announcing aformal review -- among them Reebok, Kraft General Foods'Maxwell House, and Philip Morris's Miller Lite and Benson andamp;Hedges. That sends the signal to agencies that any accountcould be fair game.   And agencies have found that persistence can pay off.Ketchum courted Bank of America for five years before the bigbank even decided to put its account up for review; theagency grabbed that plum assignment from incumbent GreyAdvertising last month. Mr. Spielvogel in recent months wroteletters and made phone calls to top Smith Barney executivespushing his agency, even though the brokerage firm remains anOgilvy andamp; Mather client. Backer was rewarded earlier this weekwhen it was invited to pitch the business.   So desirable is Coca-Cola's account that Mr. Spielvogeladmits to courting Coke for 12 years; his presentation lastweek was the fifth time he and agency co-founder Bill Backermade a formal pitch to the soft drink giant. Other agenciesalso call and write frequently, a Coke spokesman says.   Yet agencies are spending so much time, energy and moneyon wooing other people's clients that they may be neglectingtheir own. Graham Phillips, chairman of WPP Group's Ogilvy andamp;Mather, scoffs at Backer's as-yet fruitless attempts to wooCoke as a &quot;waste of time&quot; and suggests that if Mr. Spielvogel&quot;spent the same time and money on his existing clients, maybe{Backer} wouldn't have gone through the huge business losses&quot;it has suffered in the past year.   The 1990s, he adds, should be &quot;the decade when you payattention to your own clients.&quot;   Mr. Spielvogel counters that he doesn't neglect currentclients a bit, doing most of his prospecting on nights andweekends. &quot;There are people,&quot; he sniffs, &quot;who can walk andchew gum at the same time.&quot;   For clients, though, the barrage of eager agencies can beoverwhelming. Shortly after being tapped to head upadvertising for Northwest Airlines, Christopher Clouser foundhimself wallowing in dozens of letters, tapes and phonemessages from eager ad agencies. There are some 100 agencyreels in his closet. An &quot;agency onslaught&quot; is how hedescribes it. Yet when he did make an agency switch lastweek, he ignored the hordes and chose agencies he alreadyknew and had worked with before.   American Express also has been swamped by calls fromagencies, all hopeful that they can shake a piece of theaccount loose from Ogilvy andamp; Mather. But while AmericanExpress is reviewing the green card account, so far it isonly talking to agencies already on its roster. Everybodyelse is, at least for now, just wasting their time. Says aspokeswoman: &quot;We don't see people unsolicited.&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          TWA ADVERTISING: Despite Trans World Airlines' plan tocede majority ownership to creditors and to make a Chapter 11bankruptcy filing, its ad plans continue as scheduled, saidFrank Ginsberg, president of TWA ad agency Avrett, Free andamp;Ginsberg. Mr. Ginsberg said the agency presented a newcampaign Tuesday that he expects will be approved. He said,though, that TWA's spending will be less than the $45 millionthe account once billed.                                                                                                          SAATCHI STAKE: The State of Wisconsin Investment Boardincreased its stake in Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Co. to 62.2 millionshares, or 4%, making it the fourth-largest shareholder ofthe company. The board had held a similar stake beforeSaatchi's recapitalization earlier this year, but theaccompanying stock dilution reduced its stake to about 0.5%.David Herro, a portfolio manager with the Wisconsin board,said the board raised its stake because it anticipated anupturn in both Saatchi's business and the ad industry ingeneral.
