The local headquarters of the governing party, the NationalLiberation Front, and three of the largest hotels in the city weregutted in the fighting Friday night, the sources said on conditionof anonymity. The Air France office in Oran was wrecked inprotests, the airline said in Paris.   In the capital of Algiers, people returned to work under tightmilitary surveillance after four days of rioting that spurred thegovernment to declare a state of emergency and order troops to fireon demonstrators. The rioting began over sharp price increases inthe government's austerity program.   Rioters raided police commissaries in Algiers and Oran andseized arms. There was no indication that the arms were being usedagainst security forces in Algiers, but in Oran, the country'ssecond-largest city, several of the dead were said to be policemen.   Authorities have acknowledged deaths in the Algiers rioting, butwithout providing details. The diplomatic sources said they did notknow how many people died in the Algiers clashes.   Earlier unconfirmed reports said at least 12 people have died inthe unrest. Medical sources said more than 30 people were admittedto a hospital. The military has reported 900 arrests in theviolence, which began Tuesday.   Algiers, Oran and other major cities were patrolled today by alarge turnout of troops in full battle gear, with bayonets fixed totheir rifles. The army's tanks and armored personnel carriers stoodat most of the major intersections and in front of crucialgovernment offices in Algiers.   Traffic resumed, but much lighter than normal for a Saturday, anormal workday in Moslem Algeria. Algerians massed at bus stops,but so many buses had been burned in the rioting that publictransit was almost nonexistent.   Elementary and high schools remained closed, but universitiesand government offices reopened with no reports of disturbances.   State office workers tried to restore order in governmentministries where files were burned or thrown to the winds this weekin protests that began over the government's austerity program.   Disturbances were reported Friday in several other provincialcenters, including Blida and Constantine.   In the capital, Moslem fundamentalists defied a state ofemergency in a protest march Friday but dispersed withoutconfronting troops brought in to block the path.   Although Algeria's economic woes underlie the protests, themotives of different groups of demonstrators were often difficultto sort out.   The protests included youths chanting the names of theirfavorite soccer clubs, fundamentalists urging transformation ofAlgeria from a secular state into an Iranian-style Islamicrepublic, and vandals causing destruction for no apparent reason.   A military communique Friday warned that troops were ordered touse arms against ``all those who refuse to obey immediately thecall to disperse quietly.'' It expanded the nightly curfew, whichnow runs from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., instead of from midnight.   On Thursday, President Chadli Bendjedid prohibited publicdemonstrations and put police and civil administration undermilitary control.   Algeria's austerity plan is aimed at resolving an economiccrisis made worse by the fall in the price of oil, the nation'smain source of revenue.   Nearly 60 percent of Algerians are less than 20 years old.Straining under a demographic explosion that has pushed thepopulation from 9.4 million in 1954 to 23.5 million today, thecountry is trying to modernize its economy after years of astrictly government-directed economy.</TEXT></DOC>
