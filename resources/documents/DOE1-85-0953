<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-85-0953 </DOCNO><TEXT>A general model of centrifugally driven diffusion is formulated that incorporatesthe effects of the pressure gradient of a radiation belt ion populationand includes a realistic precipitation loss rate of the radiation beltions that takes on a spatially peaked form, leading to a spatially varyingionospheric conductivity. The model is applied specifically to Jupiter.Model solutions for the flux tube content of the radiation belt ion populationare found to compare favorably with reported Voyager 1 observations ofions in the energy range 0.2-30 MeV. Solution profiles for the flux-tubecontent of the cool Iogenic ion population typically favor a gradientnear L = 7.5 of between one-half and one-third of the value originallyreported by Bagenal and Sullivan (1981) and Siscoe et al. (1981). Themodel solutions are characterized by unexpectedly low values of the precipitationparameter. 25 references.</TEXT></DOC>
