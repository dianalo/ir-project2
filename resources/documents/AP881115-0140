The chief U.S. envoy, Max Kampelman, said an 11th round of talks,hoped to ``move the process forward,'' will begin early next yearafter President-elect George Bush assumes office Jan. 20.   ``We are hoping for new progress'' under the Bush administration,Moscow's chief delegate Alexei Obukhov said before a final fullmeeting of both delegations at the Soviet diplomatic mission.   Kampelman said he assured the Soviet delegation of Bush'scommitment to the talks and said the president-elect would maintain``continuity'' in the U.S. position.   ``We continue to move forward and are encouraged by thatmovement,'' Kampelman said after the session. But he added: ``Majordisagreements remain. We understand each other better and weunderstand the issues better.''   ``It is just beginning. It will continue,'' he said of thesuperpowers' effort to reduce their giant atomic arsenals.   The latest round of talks began July 12. Two areas are involved:the draft Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty aimed at cutting U.S. andSoviet long-range nuclear forces by half, and defense and space.   The talks began in March 1985 and have produced the U.S.-Sovietagreement to scrap all intermediate-range missiles.   ``We have significantly reduced both areas where positions arestarkly contrasting,'' U.S. negotiator S. Read Hanmer said of thelatest round.   He said differences were narrowed on air-launched cruisemissiles, where agreed counting rules are being sought, and onmonitoring mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles if they areincluded in the treaty.   A long-standing disagreement remains over the range anair-launched cruise missile must have to be included in the treaty,Hanmer said.   Kampelman indicated no progress was made on sea-launched cruisemissiles, which Moscow wants to limit under the pact. Washington hasresisted including them, saying they cannot be reliably monitored.   Kampelman also said President Reagan's Strategic DefenseInitiative, the program for a space-based missile defense opposed bythe Soviets, remains a ``serious'' objective and is not a bargainingchip at Geneva.   The program, popularly called ``Star Wars,'' has been a stumblingblock since negotiations began.   Kampelman said he was not aware of plans for Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev's fifth and final meeting with Reagan that U.S.officials say has been set for next month in Washington.   The summit would give the two sides another chance to narrow thegap on START.   The Geneva round formally ends Wednesday with a ceremony in whichthe two sides will exchange copies of the START treaty draft.   Kampelman, 68, said it was too early to talk about whether hewill remain chief negotiator in the Bush administration.</TEXT></DOC>
