Dorfman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AGE SLH AXP S MER PA PWJ GE </CO><IN> STK SCR </IN><TEXT>   In a continuing comparison of brokerage firms' stock-picking prowess, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. edged out Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. as the long-term leader.    The study, conducted each quarter by this newspaper and Zacks Investment Research Inc. of Chicago, tracks the performance of stocks recommended by 10 major brokerage houses.    Shearson took the long-run performance crown on the basis of its selections in the 24 months ended June 30. Thomson was the long-term champion in the 21 months through March 31 and the 18 months through Dec. 31 of last year.    A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. was once again the 12-month champ. It and Shearson were the only two firms to show net gains on their recommended stocks for the 12 months ended June 30, a period in which the October 1987 stock market crash figured prominently.    The best showing for this year's second quarter was by Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., whose recommended stocks gained 11.4%, including dividends.    Over the 12-month span, seven of the 10 firms beat the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index. But that's not so wonderful, says John Zbesko, vice president for quantitative research at Zacks, because the 10 brokerage houses typically outperformed the Sandamp;P index during that period only by picking stocks that are more volatile -- and thus riskier -- than average.    When statistical adjustments are made for that added risk, the firms' fundamental stock-picking skill appears to have deteriorated since October, Mr. Zbesko says. He notes that before the crash, brokerage firms showed &quot;some evidence&quot; of ability to pick stocks that outperform the market averages on a risk-adjusted basis. Lately, he adds, most don't show that ability.    Unlike the previous two quarters, which were dominated by strong investment trends -- the crash last fall, small stocks' success in the winter -- the latest quarter was &quot;athematic,&quot; as one brokerage official puts it. No single approach led reliably to either success or failure. Individual stock picking was the whole show.    Here's a rundown on each firm's strategy and results:   A.G. EDWARDS   &quot;We're kind of independent in St. Louis, being away from Wall Street,&quot; says Terry Dessent, director of research at the only non-New York firm in the group. During the past year, many of its picks were relatively small companies, some little known on Wall Street. Its biggest gainer, for example, was Walbro Corp. (up 106% during the 12 months), a small maker of automotive and engine fuel systems based in Cass City, Mich. Only one New York analyst follows it, according to an industry reference guide. Another big gainer, Chicago-based Union Special Machine Corp. (up 66%), apparently isn't followed by any New York analyst.    Though small stocks are often more volatile than large ones, that wasn't the case with Edwards's picks. Zacks measured the &quot;beta,&quot; or relative volatility, of each firm's portfolio over a two-year period. If a firm's stocks rise and fall about as much as the market overall, the beta is 1.00. A beta significantly above 1.00 indicates high volatility; a beta much below indicates low volatility. Edwards's stock picks had a beta of 0.84, far below the 1.12 average of the rest of the field. One reason is that Edwards often picked stocks that pay substantial dividends -- utility stocks, for example -- which tend to be more stable.    After holding up relatively well during the crash, Edwards's stocks zipped ahead in the first quarter, when small stocks were the rage. However, the firm's performance for the 24-month period and the latest quarter was only average.    SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON   Like the old, relentless Ohio State football teams, Shearson has ground ahead with &quot;three yards and a cloud of dust.&quot; The American Express Co. subsidiary heads the long-term category even though it has never led in these rankings for any single quarter or year.    Jack Rivkin, director of research, says he likes capital-goods producers such as Caterpillar Inc. and Deere andamp; Co., and chemical companies such as Dow Chemical Co. Lately, he has begun to favor some international oil concerns, which he calls &quot;almost like chemical companies in disguise,&quot; because their profit margins on petrochemicals improve when oil prices fall. One group Shearson avoids now is retailers. &quot;We believe the economy is beginning to slow down,&quot; Mr. Rivkin says. But he adds that he doesn't believe it will fall into a recession this year or next.    PRUDENTIAL-BACHE   Stocks favored by Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. were the most volatile (beta 1.24), and provided the lowest dividend yield (1.9% as of June), meaning that the company was counting heavily on capital gains. Often enough, it got them.    Pru-Bache was one of only two firms (along with Shearson) that finished in the top half of the rankings for all three time periods. Melissa Brown, director of quantitative research, says that Pru-Bache is emphasizing &quot;basic industry stocks, like the chemicals (and) the papers,&quot; but that unlike some competitors, it &quot;hasn't given up on the consumer.&quot; Its consumer-related stocks include Anheuser-Busch Cos., Campbell Soup Co. and Detroit's Big Three auto producers.    DEAN WITTER   Manny Korman, director of research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., says he's using an &quot;eclectic&quot; approach with &quot;no major concentration in any one sector.&quot; That approach produced a middle-of-the-road showing for the latest quarter and the 12 months. But Dean Witter trailed the field over the full 24 months.    MERRILL LYNCH   Giant Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. had lots of big winners and losers. Of the 10 stocks in the study that showed the largest 12-month gains, four were picked by Merrill. Of the 10 biggest losers, five were Merrill picks.    One reason is that Merrill has no recommended list, and so Zacks ranks it based on the stocks highly recommended by its analysts. That makes for a lengthy list (currently 139 stocks), and lots of stocks means lots of chances for home runs -- or strike-outs.    Beyond that, Zacks's statistics show that Merrill's picks had a &quot;swing for the fences&quot; flavor. Compared with those of most other firms, Merrill's choices included a lot of small stocks that pay skimpy dividends and sport high price-earnings ratios. (The price-earnings ratio is the stock price per share divided by the company's earnings per share.) Often, those are young, fast-growing companies offering above-average potential gains and above-average risk.    SMITH BARNEY   &quot;We've viewed the market as being in a trading range,&quot; where price swings are relatively limited, says D. Larry Smith, director of research. &quot;So we've put our focus on total-return stocks&quot; -- that is, stocks whose dividends make up a fair part of the anticipated return. Indeed, Smith Barney's picks had the highest dividend yield in the group, 3.8%.    Solid gains in such stocks as First Chicago Corp., Motorola Inc. and Smith International Inc. helped Smith Barney, a Primerica Corp. subsidiary, lead the second-quarter rankings. It remained in the middle of the rankings for 12 months, but pulled into third place in 24-month performance.    Mr. Smith expects to continue the total-return approach for a while. The Federal Reserve, he says, is &quot;resisting the economy,&quot; so &quot;it's hard to argue for a big (stock) market upturn.&quot;    PAINEWEBBER   Explaining PaineWebber Inc.'s strong second-quarter showing, Charles Pradilla, vice chairman of the investment-policy committee, says a &quot;value approach has worked very well this year, as opposed to 1987.&quot; One value indicator PaineWebber looks for is a P-E ratio that seems low in light of a company's earnings growth rate.    PaineWebber had more than its share of big winners for the 12-month period, notably Inland Steel Industries Inc. (up 108%), E-II Holdings Inc. (up 82%), Shorewood Packaging Corp. (up 81%), and New Jersey Steel Corp. (up 70%). Despite that, its performance for the 12 months and 24 months was close to the middle of the pack.    DREXEL BURNHAM   Among the laggards in 24-month and 12-month performance, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was in the middle of the standings for the second quarter. Arthur Kirsch, director of research, attributes the improvement to a &quot;bit more active management&quot; of the firm's Priority Selection List, and to the fact that big-company stocks, which dominate Drexel's list, &quot;have performed somewhat better lately.&quot;    THOMSON MCKINNON   Thomson managed a second-quarter return of only 2.8%, the worst among the 10 firms. Harry Zisson, Thomson's director of research, says it is long-term performance that counts, so he's not especially upset with a bad showing in a given quarter.    Perhaps with the recent subpar performance in mind, Mr. Zisson has shaken up the firm's Long-Term Investment list, adding American Cyanamid Co., CPC International Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Ingersoll-Rand Co., Kroger Co., Schlumberger Ltd. and Security Pacific Corp., and removing Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Co., Chubb Corp. and Emerson Electric Co.    KIDDER PEABODY   Last in the 12-month standings, Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., which is 80% owned by General Electric Co., was also the only firm among the bottom three for all three time periods. Edward Steube, vice president for research marketing, explains that Kidder, in line with a &quot;cautious investment posture,&quot; has been emphasizing &quot;financially strong, consistent-earnings-growth companies,&quot; even as cyclical stocks have lately posted the best gains. Now, he says, Kidder has added some &quot;late cycle&quot; stocks (which tend to prosper toward the end of an economic upturn), especially regional banks such as Norwest Corp. and First Union Corp.    ---   How the Big Brokerage Houses' Favorite Stocks Performed   Estimated performance of stocks recommended by major securities firms in periods ended June 30, 1988, ranked on the basis of performance in the most recent 12 months, along with each firm's biggest gainer and loser during the 12 months.   3      12     24 MOS.
