 The evaluationcriteria for the award can also be used as guidelines for creatingan organization that meets total quality management standards.andO;There are seven evaluation guidelines: leadership, information andanalysis, strategic quality planning, human resource utilization,quality assurance of products and services, quality results andcustomer satisfaction.andP;  These guidelines can be transformed intogoals for government agencies to strive for.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Government AgencyQuality ControlMethodsIncentivesPrograms.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Adapting National Quality Award to AgenciesandM;Since Congress created the National Quality Award in 1987, awards have goneonly to the private sector.andP;  Awards program officials have said they want toextend the program to the public sector, but I doubt that will happen in thenear future.andM;However, that does not preclude government agencies from embracing and usingthe National Quality Award program.andP;  In this column I want to describe thequality model used for this program and explain how government managers canuse that model to improve their agencies.andM;The evaluation criteria used for the National Quality Award competition arealso the model for installing and operating a total quality managementsystem.andP;  The model has seven components: leadership, information andanalysis, strategic quality planning, human resource utilization, qualityassurance of products and services, quality results and customersatisfaction.andM;Leadership is the driver for total quality management.andP;  It involvesestablishing the vision and direction, and then having senior managementbecome involved pesonally in realizing the vision.andM;This category examines the senior executives' leadership in creating qualityvalues and building the values into the way the company does business, andhow the executives and the company project the quality values outside thecompany.andM;Participation in activities such as those of national and internationalorganizations may earn extra credit in this category, depending on the typeand resources of the business and the competitive and regulatory environmentsin which it operates.andM;Evaluations are based on the appropriateness, effectiveness and extent of theexecutives' and the company's involvement in relation to the size and type ofbusiness.andM;Whether the company has a quality staff or regulatory affairs staff is notconsidered.andP;  This is true in all the following categories, as well.andM;For example, in evaluating human resources development, the judges do notexamine whether the company has a human resources staff or in-house trainingprograms.andP;  Education and training might be accomplished through schools, bycontractors or with the help of customers.andM;The information and analysis category examines how well the company'sinformation systems support total quality management.andP;  The scope, managementand analysis of data depend on the type of business, its resources, numberand distribution of business units, and other factors.andM;Evaluations are based on the appropriateness and effectiveness of methods formanaging and analyzing information in relation to these business factors.andM;Quality LeadershipandM;The next category, strategic quality planning, examines the company'sapproach to planning to determine its adequacy to achieve or sustain qualityleadership.andP;  Although the planning processes and development of priorities donot depend appreciably on the size and type of business, the scope and typeof benchmark and competitive data may vary.andM;Competitive and benchmark data are essential for planning to achieve qualityleadership because they make possible clear and objective comparisons.andP;  Theprincipal considerations in assessing the effectiveness of competitive andbenchmark data are in relation to the competitive environment and resources.andO;Evaluations of planning are based on the thoroughness and effectiveness ofprocesses.andM;The human resource utilization category examines the appropriateness andeffectiveness of the company's efforts to develop and involve the entire workforce in total quality.andM;The organization of efforts depends on the number of employees, the company'sresources, the geographical distribution of business units and other factors.andM;Another category is quality assurance of products and services.andP;  Thiscategory has a very strong process and systems orientation.andP;  Processes may becarried out entirely by employees, largely by means of technology or througha combination of the two.andM;The degree of formality in systems and processes depends on factors such assize of the business.andP;  Evaluations take into account consistency of executionof quality operations that incorporate a sound prevention basis accompaniedby continuous quality improvement activities.andM;Consistency of execution means defined, suitably recorded processes withclear delineation of responsibilities.andM;The quality results category examines the company's quality improvement andquality levels by themselves and in relation to those of competitors.andO;Included are quality of products and services, internal operations andsuppliers.andP;  The type of measures depends on factors such as the company'ssize, types of products and services, and competitive environment.andM;The last category, customer satsifaction, examines the company's knowledge ofcustomer requirements, service and responsiveness, and satisfaction resultsmeasured through indicators.andP;  The scope of activities to gather information,to serve and to respond to customers depends upon many factors.andM;Evaluations are based on the effectiveness of efforts in relation to thesebusiness factors.andP;  They also take into account whether a company useseverything available to it to meet all the requirements of an excellentcustomer service system.andM;The TQM system is designed to achieve customer satisfaction.andP;  This lastcomponent examines achievement of the goal, the customer's assessment of howwell the organization did.andM;To benefit from this program, a government agency should start by getting acopy of the National quality Award guidelines.andM;A single copy of the guidelines is available at no cost from the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology.andP;  Address your request to Curt Reimann,Director for Quality Programs, National Institute of Standards andTechnology, Gaithersburg, Md.andP;  20899.andM;Once you have the model, evaluate it.andP;  The National Quality Award criteriaare a system for managing an organization.andM;If the National Quality Award model is acceptable, evaluate your agency'smanagement system against it.andM;The starting point is to know where you benchmark against the model.andP;  Theareas of deficiency then becomes opportunities for improvement.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
