In a report, the task force headed by John R. Dunne,assistant attorney general for civil rights, recommended thatCongress approve stiffer fines and stronger enforcementagainst employers who violate the law's anti-discriminationprovisions. It also called for better education of employersand employees on the law's requirements, and simpler formsand procedures for verifying an employee's work eligibility.</LP><TEXT>   The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act was intendedto curb illegal immigration by imposing penalties againstemployers who knowingly hire undocumented workers, andrequires them to check the work-authorization documents ofall employees hired. The federal General Accounting Officefound earlier this year that the sanctions had prompted a&quot;widespread pattern of discrimination&quot; by employers againstjob applicants who appeared foreign-born.   The task force said it was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about thesanctions' discriminatory effects, but did not addresswhether the measures should be repealed because that issueshould be decided by Congress.   Minority and civil rights groups that have been lobbyingfor repeal of sanctions were encouraged by the findings. &quot;Theball is in Congress' court&quot; to repeal sanctions, said CeciliaMunoz, a senior policy analyst with the National Council forLa Raza in Washington, D.C. &quot;And it eliminates any lingeringdoubts that sanctions cause discrimination.&quot;   Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the JudiciarySubcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, said therecommendations weren't enough. &quot;I'm skeptical thatsafeguards such as those proposed by the task force can bedrawn tightly enough to end discrimination,&quot; he said.Instead, he said he would continue to seek repeal of thesanctions &quot;because they are discriminatory against HispanicAmericans, Asian Americans and other ethnic minorities.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
