U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene ruled that the 1984 lawsetting up a commission appointed by the president to write theguidelines violated the constitutional doctrine of separation ofpowers.   The judge found that Congress had unconstitutionally delegatedlegislative power to the seven-member U.S. Sentencing Commission.   ``The system thus departs from the basic principle that thosewho make or administer this nation's laws shall be accountable fortheir actions,'' Greene ruled. He accused lawmakers ofrelinquishing their power ``to insulate Congress from extendeddebate and political complaint.''   ``It also departs from the Constitution's requirement for cleardelineations between and among the three branches of government,''he said of the system.   The judge, however, stayed his order pending Supreme Courtreview of the question. So far, 59 federal judges have struck downthe guidelines as unconstitutional, while 31 have upheld theregulations.   Public Citizen, a Ralph Nader group that is challenging theguidelines on behalf of criminal defendants, and the JusticeDepartment on Thursday petitioned the Supreme Court to review adecision by a federal judge in Kansas City that struck down theguidelines.   The petition seeks high-court review before the decision isappealed to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis.   The guidelines, intended to eliminate wide disparities insentences for the same crimes, provide a complicated formula fordetermining prison terms for defendants convicted of federal crimes.   Greene said he was particularly troubled by the lack ofaccountability for the way sentences are imposed under theguidelines, which took effect last fall for crimes committed afterNov. 1.   ``No one _ criminal defendant, victim, and the public _ can knowwho or what branch of government is responsible for sentences thatare imposed, and there is no one who can legitimately be heldaccountable, politically or otherwise, for sentences that may beregarded as too lenient,'' Greene wrote.   ``The simple and constitutionally tested system of allocatingresponsibility for crafting sentencing policy to Congress and forimposing individual sentences to a particular judge is essentiallygone, replaced by a hodge-podge of contributions to sentencing frompersonnel from several different branches'' of government, he added.   The commission includes three judges who are appointed by thepresident from a list of six federal judges submitted by the U.S.Judicial Conference.   Unlike the delegation of legislative powers to regulatoryagencies, ``the matters being delegated involve not the regulationof economic forces and factors but basic policy decisions of lawenforcement, of criminal control and of punishment,'' Greene said.   The case before Greene involved a defendant convicted last monthof possessing cocaine with intent to distribute. Defense attorneyGreg English said that under the old sentencing rules, clientWilbert S. Brodie would face a minimum imprisonment of five years.   English said the guidelines would require a much longer minimumsentence but that without the probation department's report itwould be impossible to predict what the regulations would prescribe.</TEXT></DOC>
