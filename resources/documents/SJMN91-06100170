The restcomes from groundwater.;    Although the State Water Project has measured therecent rain runoff and already doubled the amount it will offer some citiesoutside the Tri-City area, San Francisco's numbers will not be known untilafter April 23, said Paul Piraino, manager of administration for the AlamedaCounty Water District.;    &quot;We want to wait until we have a plan that is wellstructured and offers flexibility so it can be tailored to our area's needs,&quot;said Piraino.;    Among the measures proposed earlier was a plan to chargesingle-family households that use more than their allotment up to 10 timesmore per gallon than they currently pay. Someone who uses more than 1,000gallons per day would see their bill rise from $72 to more than $460.Single-family residences would be allotted 225 gallons per day, which is theaverage current use, according to district figures.;    Instead, the boardapproved Piraino's recommendation that a water supply emergency be declared inorder to establish regulatory powers needed to enforce a mandatory droughtconservation plan.;    The district board of directors was told in Februarythat it could expect only 10 percent of what it wanted from the State WaterProject and half of its Hetch Hetchy order. On February 28, the board calledfor an increase in voluntary water conservation efforts from 25 percentreductions to 35 percent pending a decision on whether mandatory measureswould be necessary.;    In other matters, the board will meet tonight todiscuss whether to participate in a state water bank, which would sell waterto districts with the greatest need.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Both meetingsof the Alameda County Water District will start at 7 p.m. tonight and Thursdayat district headquarters, 43885 South Grimmer Blvd., Fremont.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  FERNANDO QUINTERO, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910409  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  433  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday April 9, 199100100170,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
