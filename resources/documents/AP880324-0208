George Bush, meanwhile, headed for Connecticutexpecting to pad his huge lead on the GOP side.   Gephardt said he'd made no decision to drop out, declaring, ``Mymother always told me to cross one bridge at a time.'' But thescramble was already on to pick up supporters who would be freed ifhe withdrew.   ``There's no question there are some union leaders who are nowsupporting Dick Gephardt who would find Paul Simon the mostattractive of the alternatives,'' said Illinois Sen. Simon at anappearance in Kalamazoo.   Simon, who is in fourth place in the Democratic delegate count,just ahead of Gephardt, spoke of getting ``back in the ballgame.''   Among the Republicans, former Transportation Secretary ElizabethDole, wife of Bush's main rival, Sen. Bob Dole, said in Oshkosh,Wis., that her husband now has merely a ``long shot'' chance, butshe added, ``He's got the grit and determination needed to keep himin the running.''   She said neither she nor her husband have discussed thepossibility that one of them might be Bush's running mate for thegeneral election. ``I'm really not seeking to be on the ticket. I'mgoing 12 hours a day just trying to carry Bob's message,'' she said.   Vice President Bush, holding a commanding lead in the battle forRepublican convention delegates, was traveling to Connecticut,saying he was taking nothing for granted in the primary there nextTuesday.   However, public opinion polls give him a big lead over Dole inthe state where Bush was born and where his father once served as aU.S. senator.   Gephardt, just a few weeks ago the victor in Iowa's caucuses,now lags behind Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson, Albert Gore Jr. andSimon in delegates to the national convention. He trails Dukakisand Jackson in public opinion polls preceding Saturday's Michigancaucuses.   He said Thursday in Detroit, ``Rather than trying to guess allthe different hypotheticals of what might happen, I just think wehave to be patient, wait to see the outcome and then decide whatother steps should be taken.''   Still, Gephardt's wife Jane told a radio interviewer inMichigan, ``I think Dick has to come in first or a real strongsecond to remain in the race. ... If we don't do well here, we willnot be able to continue.''   The Missouri congressman has only until Tuesday to file forre-election to his House seat, and one aide, commenting only oncondition he not be named, suggested that it was important for thecongressman to retain that office in order to raise money. Hiscampaign has been strapped for cash for weeks.   Money was in the news for several other current and formercandidates on Thursday:   _Gore said in Washington he was willing to release informationon more than $1 million in loans taken out by his presidentialcampaign, but members of his staff who heard the senator's remarkssaid no such decision had been made.   Gore's pledge to release the material came after a report in aNashville, Tenn., newspaper that his campaign had put up theproceeds of future fund-raisers and federal matching funds ascollateral for almost $1.5 million borrowed from banks about twoweeks ago.   _The Federal Election Commission said that Gary Hart, now thathe is no longer a presidential candidate, can use leftover 1988campaign funds toward retiring his lingering debt of about $1million from his 1984 race.   _The FEC agreed to grant federal matching funds to politicalextremist Lyndon LaRouche's presidential campaign, even though heis standing trial on a charge relating to alleged financialirregularity in his 1984 campaign. LaRouche is running as aDemocrat, although the national party has disavowed his candidacy.   The Democrats, including Gephardt, were concentrating onMichigan and on Wisconsin, which has its primary on April 5.   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, who spent the first part of the weektrading charges with Gephardt on foreign-trade policy, a majorissue in a state heavily dependent on U.S. auto sales, was inCalifornia but planned to spend all day Friday in Michigan. TheDetroit Free Press endorsed him on Thursday.   Dole's aides said he had no campaign events scheduled Thursday,and former television evangelist Pat Robertson was to address arally in Falls Church, Va., working to shore up his strength in hishome state.</TEXT></DOC>
