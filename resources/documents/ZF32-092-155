Who else will be using the hardware? How much CPU time do they use?andO;When do they need access? Will they have priority over me?)andM;* Reliability of the hardware.andP;  (How often will I miss my monthly orquarterly close deadline because of computer downtime?)andM;Unless you've been through many selection projects, you're outgunned by thevendor salespeople.andP;  They usually have many years of experience with systemselections, and they're certain they have the product you need.andO;Unfortunately, selection projects usually are conducted under a time crunchwith deadlines, and this is the real hook for the salespeople--they knowyou're looking to buy.andP;  Depending on your circumstances, dealing with a savvysalesperson can be a problem or a challenge.andP;  In rare cases, you can usetheir expertise to your advantage.andM;The successful selection of a financial system often involves a considerableinvestment on the part of the company--a conversion effort, education andretraining of personnel and sometimes a re-engineering of internalprocedures.andP;  Given the size of the investment, the number of people impacted,time constraints, personnel constraints, and the chance that something willgo wrong along the way, these high visibility system selections often impact,for good or ill, the careers of MIS and financial managers.andM;Removing The GuessworkandM;FIRST, YOU MUST RECOGNIZE that system selection is a process and it involvesmany decisions along the way.andP;  It's the process that lays the foundation forall the steps that follow--installation of hardware and software, softwareconfiguration, data conversion, customization, testing, training, and finallytransition to the new system.andP;  A strong foundation improves the likelihoodthat the whole project will succeed, that the goals will be achieved(criteria, schedule and budget), and the company will benefit from thesystem.andM;The system selection process itself is typically conducted in three distinctsubprocesses, requirements definition, request for proposal, and evaluationof proposals and selection.andP;  Each of these subprocesses requires planning andmanagement, and the successful accomplishment of each prepares a manager orselection committee for the next step by providing the necessary informationfor analysis and decision making.andM;The first subprocess is the requirements definition.andP;  The aim of this processis to examine and document what is needed from the system.andP;  If there's morethan one application involved, then the requirements for each should bedefined separately before common requirements (e.g., hardware, softwareinterfaces, disk storage and response times) are listed.andM;The key to a successful requirements definition is involvement of futureusers and supervisors of this system, along with the MIS personnel, in a teameffort.andP;  Together these groups can compile the information necessary tointelligently evaluate alternatives and define performance criteria.andP;  As therequirements are defined, each must be weighed and its importance noted.andP;  Atypical approach is to include a column assessing the need for each featurelisted (e.g., must, desired, wish list) and a weighing of factors on somescale (e.g., 1-10, A-D).andM;In addition to the actual system specifications, there are some basic detailsabout your company you will want to include in your requirements definition.andO;Before you contact a vendor, you should prepare a company profile (backgroundinformation, size, geographic locations, etc.) and an information systemsarchitecture profile (current hardware platforms, current software, futureplans).andM;Taking ApplicationsandM;ONCE THE REQUIREMENTS definition and accompanying profiles are complete, youare ready to contact the vendors and begin the request for proposal (RFP)subprocess.andP;  This may involve several iterations in which you prescreenpotential vendors using the system requirements that you have classified as&quot;musts&quot; to narrow the field.andP;  If a vendor doesn't offer or can't provide thecritical items on your list, there is no use pursuing the process anyfurther.andP;  Chances are there will be several vendors that can offer everythingyou need and more.andM;The goal of the RFP subprocess is to contact appropriate vendors and solicitfinancial system solutions.andP;  Your evaluation process will be more efficientif you can gather substantial information about the vendors and theirproducts in advance.andP;  Management often will review this step to determine ifadequate effort was made to identify the best solution.andP;  They will want tosee that enough vendors were contacted and considered to provide managementwith the available range of alternatives.andP;  In many cases, they also willreview the process to see that an equitable approach was used whenrecommending products for evaluation.andM;People frequently underestimate the time it takes to complete a thorough RFP.andO;It's important to allow adequate time to consider vendors and products inadvance.andP;  This way, the actual evaluation and review process can proceed muchmore quickly.andP;  However, you should also be careful to budget the time youallot to each potential vendor.andP;  If permitted, vendor salespeople willmonopolize your time and your staff with frequent meetings, stacks ofliterature and even fancy lunches.andP;  Consider in advance how many meetingswith each vendor you will have.andP;  Also, determine before the process beginshow many people from your company will be involved in vendor demonstrations.andM;One way to manage your interaction with the vendors is to put together aschedule for the project and present it along with the RFP.andP;  This couldinclude both a timetable for the process and procedural guidelines fordelivery of proposals, arranging information meetings and productdemonstrations and handling questions and answers.andP;  Such a schedule providesand a structure for you and the vendor to follow and measure progressagainst.andM;How does one find the appropriate vendors to solicit proposals from? One wayis to search reference books or services (e.g., DataPro, DataSources) forvendors.andP;  Another way is to review trade publications for relevant articlesand advertisements.andP;  A third way is to use your hardware and software vendorsto do some of this work for you.andM;Vendors usually have experience and access to resources you don't.andP;  They mayhave teamed with other vendors to deliver particular capabilities in thepast, and hardware vendors (HP included) have liaison personnel who can steeryou toward appropriate software vendors for particular applications.andP;  Youwin, of course, have to research for yourself the background of the vendorsand the appropriateness of their solutions.andM;The Bottom LineandM;THE THIRD AND FINAL subprocess is the evaluation of proposals and selectionof a vendor.andP;  This is often a whittling down procedure in which the originalhorde of vendors is reduced to a select few.andP;  Narrowing the field allows youto make a more detailed analysis of particular solutions.andP;  Also, once youhave reduced the number of applications you are considering, you can usuallyafford to involve more people in the product demonstrations.andM;If considerable time has elapsed since the project began--and this isfrequently the case--it's important to review the key factors to make sureyou haven't strayed off course and that the key factors are stillappropriate.andP;  The business world is constantly changing and the pace hasincreased.andP;  In a few short months, conditions may change dramatically enoughto require different selection criteria and a different solution.andM;To pull the process together, you should prepare a comprehensive report onthe viable solutions.andP;  By this stage, only three or four strong, potentialsolutions should remain.andP;  For the evaluation to be effective, thealternatives must be compared in an objective manner.andP;  This can be difficultif you are considering several hardware platforms or if multiple vendors areinvolved in some of the solutions but not in others.andM;Another obstacle to objective analysis can be your own organization.andP;  Theanalysis, evaluation and recommendation data will be most useful if it isreduced to a comprehensible set of information presented in a format peoplecan review and interpret efficiently.andP;  Formats that are used widely andsuccessfully include tables (or spreadsheets) with short summary narrativesprovided as backup.andP;  The executives who make the final decisions rarely havethe time required to study a lengthy or disorganized report.andM;What's In Your Future?andM;YOUR GOAL MUST BE to make sure the financial system you select meets both thepresent and future needs of your company.andP;  It must be compatible with yourcompany's overall business goals and information systems plan.andP;  To ascertainwhether a particular system is a good investment, you need to consider whatthe future growth of your company is likely to be.andP;  A good system win provideyou with the capability to address new business needs as they arise.andM;To stay abreast of tomorrow's business market, you may need to add financialservices, such as currency translation, or you may need to adapt to a newcomputing environment.andP;  Ask yourself whether the system will accomodate thechanges you are presently planning and those that are just in the back ofyour mind.andP;  For example, does it allow you to add electronic data interchange(EDI) capabilities or interface an imaging system?andM;It's crucial that your investment adequately meets the company's needs forthe next several years.andP;  In the future, a poorly chosen financial system mayimpede your company's growth or hinder a strategic change.andP;  Likewise,choosing the wrong hardware or software platform can create problems for yourinformation systems policy in the future.andP;  How well this financial systemwill integrate with other corporate systems now and in the future should be aprimary concern.andP;  Without a forward-looking information strategy, selecting afinancial system or other software application could become considerably moreexpensive in the long term.andM;Another issue you should consider is how your financial operation differsfrom standard financial procedures.andP;  Some financial concerns result from theindustry your firm is in (e.g., the need to handle partial payments, trackfactors, handle multiple companies, track internal project costs, etc.).andO;Most financial system vendors have been around long enough to developincremental modules that can be added to their systems to handle specializedindustry features.andP;  Therefore, the final differentiating factor frequentlyamounts to the systems' capability to provide certain specialized,non-standard or esoteric types of functionality.andM;In selecting your system, it is always best to avoid bargain hunting.andO;Software purchased at bargain-basement prices often turns out to be worthexactly what you pay for it.andP;  An inexpensive package could lack criticalfeatures, require the purchase of additional modules or offer weak customerand implementation support.andP;  Read the fine print when considering specialdeals and promotional offers.andP;  If the vendor is reliable and the packagemeets your needs as specified in the requirements definition process, then byafl means take advantage of a good deal.andP;  But remember that a promotionaloffer could be part of an effort to clear inventory before a replacementproduct (computer, disk drive, software release) is introduced.andP;  You don'twant to get left out in the cold for the sake of short-term savings.andM;One of the most valuable and often overlooked information gathering tools isthe reference check.andP;  When you're faced with several financial systems thataU offer the basic services you need, the vendor's background can be a keydetermining factor.andP;  The number of years the vendor has been in the financialsoftware business, the size of the vendor company, the number of sites whereits product is installed--these are aU important concerns, and most of thisinformation is easy to come by.andM;But vendors also provide conversion and implementation services, and theirtrack record for implementing systems and providing ongoing support should beof interest to you.andP;  Use the references from the vendor as a starting pointfor gathering this information.andP;  Also, investigate whether there's a softwareusers group, find out how frequently updates to the system are released andask users how their implementation went.andM;In The Final Analysis...andM;THERE ARE MANY USEFUL methods and tips for a successful system selection andimplementation.andP;  However, without the backing of the decision-makers in yourcompany, good project management skills and the right personnel, all themethods, procedures, and tips are useless.andP;  Good people can make a less thanoptimal system work; and poor management teamed with weak personnel can turnthe best system into an unworkable mess.andM;Put the right people on the project, provide strong management and align thesystem selection with your company's goals, and you will guarantee success.andO;The future of the company will in part depend on the future capabilities ofthe system you buy.andP;  A well-planned purchasing process will help ensure thatyou buy a system not only for what it does now, but for what it will do andallow for in the future.--Mitchell Klieman is principal of MNK Consulting,San Rafael, CA.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
