As a result of carbonization, thetotal radiation loss decreased down to one fifth of the RF power, whichresulted in an increase in electrons and total stored energy comparedwith these conditions before carbonization. The thickness of the carbonlayer was 300-900 A, and its toroidal uniformity was within a factorof 3, although only one anode and one gas-inlet were used. A thin carbidelayer is formed between the C-film and the stainless steel substratewith carbonization at room temperature. The hydrogen concentration is40-50 at.% in the carbon layer. Deposition of carbon was observed onwindow materials. The deposition rate was relatively less on electricalinsulators compared to the deposition rate on metals.</TEXT></DOC>
