 The Macoffers greater flexibility when showing a production, but VCRs aremore common in conference rooms.andP;  An ideal multimedia system usesdigital technology for both input and output.andP;  Transferringmultimedia to video requires converting images and audio signalsinto analog format.andP;

 Is it foryou?andP;  There are important issues to consider.andP;  Some technology is stillwaiting in the wings, yet workable options are available now.andP;  The problemsand possibilities are discussed here, and two real-life projects arehighlighted.andM;OK, you think it's a great idea to have a Macintosh-based multimediapresentation -- images, motion and sound -- for a trade show or a board-roompresentation.andP;  What's next?andM;Really, your first question should be whether the project deserves thattreatment, said John deLormier Jr.andP;  of Inkman andamp; Associates, a multimediaproducer in Novato, Calif.andP;  &quot;These projects are so big, they're like making amovie.andP;  They take a lot of money.&quot;andM;Most producers say it's difficult to talk price without discussing thespecific project.andP;  But Jim Edlin, a senior partner in The HyperMedia Group ofEmeryville, Calif., said a full-fledged production generally costs in thetens of thousands of dollars.andP;  Simpler projects can run less, and ado-it-yourself approach to simple projects can bring costs down to barelymore than time and materials.andP;  However, Edlin maintained that substantialcosts can be justified for high-level corporate presentations or projectswith large audiences.andP;  (See sidebar, Page XX.)andM;The next decision to make is whether the project will be displayed on theMacintosh or on a VCR or videodisc player.andM;Showing a production on a Mac is more flexible, said Marney Morris, presidentof Animatrix, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based design and media production firm.andO;It's easier to make changes, and the result can be more interactive.andP;  On theother hand, playing a tape can be easier; just about every businessconference room has a VCR, but not all have a Mac.andM;If you're aiming for a high-end board-room production, you can target an8-Mbyte Mac IIci with a graphics accelerator and a large-screen monitor or avideo projector, a system that costs between $12,000 and $30,000.andP;  For ademonstration packed with a software package, you may have to work with theMac common denominator: a small screen, black and white, and no extrahardware.andP;  &quot;In the real world, you work with what you have,&quot; Morris said.andM;Furthermore, she pointed out, if the result is going to end up on video, allthe digital elements created on the Mac will have to be turned into analogsignals for output, while an on-the-Mac approach requires digitizing anypre-existing graphics or sounds.andM;&quot;Ideally,&quot; she said, &quot;everything should be digital.&quot;andM;What's 24 bits worth?andP;  The trade-off between the practical and the ideal alsoplays a large role in determining whether color presentations should useeight-bit color rather than Apple's recently introduced 32-bit colorQuickDraw (24 bits of color plus eight bits of control).andP;  The 32-bit approachrequires special video hardware and programs, but it produces more-realisticimages.andM;For some multimedia producers, full 24- and 32-bit color is a necessity evenif it takes more hardware support.andM;&quot;What broke it open for us was [the arrival of] 32-bit color,&quot; said KurtWiley, technical director of Allied Visual Artists Inc. of Los Angeles.andP;  Thecompany, which Wiley described as specializing in &quot;computer-aided classic and3-D animation,&quot; does a lot of work for well-known animators using acombination of hand work and Macs.andP;  Because their goal is to produce imageson the Mac equal in resolution to what they get on film, they need the fullcolor spectrum afforded by 32-bit color.andM;Using 32-bit color can mean trading color quality for ease of use and slowerproduction and playback, said Eve Elberg, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based free-lancemultimedia producer who teaches at the Pratt Institute, also in Brooklyn.andO;Programs such as PixelPaint Professional from SuperMac Technology Inc. ofSunnyvale, Calif., are slow in 24-bit color mode, she said, and not all thebugs are out of 32-bit support from essential tools such as the MacroMindAccelerator (from Macro-Mind Inc. of San Francisco) needed to play backMacroMind Director animations at full-motion speeds.andM;Overall, Elberg said, attempting full productions in 24 or 32 bits requires alot of work-arounds.andM;For those with the budget for extra hardware, however, help is starting toappear.andP;  Graphics accelerator cards, such as SuperMac's Spectrum/24 II, canboost the speed of a 24-bit display to about the same speed as unacceleratedone-bit displays, said Jim Armstrong, former Apple multimedia and HyperCardevangelist and now a multimedia developer.andP;  Without that kind of hardwaresupport, a Mac with 24-bit software runs more slowly than with eight-bitsoftware, even in eight-bit color mode.andM;However, not every project must have full 24- or 32-bit color, said BrianLoube, an animation director at R/Greenberg Associates in New York.andP;  For ananimated penguin sequence in a commercial for N'ice cough drops, heexplained, R/Greenberg wanted penguins to talk.andP;  Loube turned to MacroMindDirector with eight-bit animation to do the talking penguin beaks, he said,because it was more important to produce reasonable results quickly than toaim for maximum realism.andM;Similarly, The HyperMedia Group's Edlin reported that eight-bit images werefine for catalogs with digitized color photos.andM;Storing the bits.andP;  Whatever resolution you choose, producers agreed, creatingor importing the images rapidly leads to the next big decision: how to workwith, store and play back the resulting files.andP;  Multimedia storagerequirements can be staggering.andM;&quot;We work with files of more than 12 Mbytes for a single image,&quot; Allied'sWiley noted.andP;  With available Mac configurations supporting only a maximum of8 Mbytes of RAM under the Macintosh operating system, multimedia artists haveto rely on techniques that put parts of images on disk.andP;  Wiley, for example,said his staff uses Virtual -- a program that simulates extra RAM memoryusing storage space on a hard disk -- from Connectix of Menlo Park, Calif.,andO;but he said he's hoping that Apple will soon solve the issue with its ownvirtual memory scheme and bigger available memory space in the forthcomingSystem 7.andM;Furthermore, the problem isn't just with single images.andP;  An animationsequence needs multiple images, which all have to be stored as well asedited.andM;For this type of production, Wiley said, users need an effective compressiontechnique for packing more image information into less storage space and forspeeding the transfer of images from storage to memory.andP;  TIFF and otherordinary formats used for most scanned documents aren't efficient enough.andO;Forthcoming video compression techniques range from the Digital VideoInteractive (DVI) approach shown by Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp. and IBMCorp. to some of the experimental methods demonstrated by Apple.andM;However, productions that don't use digitized images or a large number of32-bit pictures can be much smaller.andP;  According to Armstrong, most workadaymultimedia presentations fit on a 44-Mbyte removable hard drive.andM;Sound bytes.andP;  Handling sound and music brings up another set of decisions.andO;As with images, sound can be digitally produced from start through recordingand up to the final stages of playback, or it can be captured from the analogreal world, then stored and edited in digital form.andM;The Mac has sound output capability, and later models have sound chips, saidproducer deLormier.andP;  But right now the full capability of the Mac is oftenneeded to handle either images or sound.andP;  And since sound is played out ofRAM, you can't have much CD-quality sound without using a third-partyproduct.andM;Projects distributed on CD-ROMs, in which the total data rate (the amount ofsound you can get from a certain amount of storage) is limited, require agreat deal of forethought to arrange the sound and image transitions so theywon't get in each other's way.andM;Compression is also needed for captured analog sound, said freelancer Elberg.andO;Even the basic-quality sound captured with what seems to have become thestandard tool, Sound Recorder from Farallon Computing Inc. of Berkeley,Calif., quickly fills many megabytes in just a few minutes of recording.andO;And, said Elberg, for some projects she really wants CD-audio fidelity orbetter, higher-quality sound than Sound Recorder delivers.andM;Synchronization of sound and picture can also be a challenge with currentSystem software and hardware, said Armstrong.andP;  The Mac, he said, wasoriginally designed for static documents, so sound support is still limited.andO;While some new synchronization facilities had been planned for System 7,Apple said this feature is one of several that won't be included in theinitial System 7.0 release.andM;So for some presentations, an add-on sound board such as the new $1,000Audiomedia card from Digidesign of Menlo Park, Calif., may be the way to go.andO;The board includes a digital signal processor chip for manipulating analogwave forms.andP;  This approach allows the board to create complex sound usingvery low data rates from the Macintosh.andM;Putting it all together.andP;  While entire multimedia productions can be createdwith single programs, most developers said they prefer using more-specializedtools to create the different elements of a production and then integratingthe results.andP;  SuperCard from Silicon Beach Software Inc. of San Diego,HyperCard and MacroMind Director are the most frequently cited integrationtools.andM;&quot;If you're talking base platform, broadest possible distribution, chances areyou're talking HyperCard,&quot; said Edlin.andP;  &quot;But if you're talking color andmultiple windows, you're not.&quot;andM;Integration platforms can also be mixed, said Dr.andP;  Robert Markison, a SanFrancisco-based hand surgeon who makes extensive use of multimedia inteaching and presentations.andP;  He uses HyperCard, MacroMind Director andVideoWorks II, sometimes in combination with slides and overheads.andP;  The righttool, he said, &quot;depends on the project and the audience.&quot; Without a range ofchoices to work with, he cautioned, even a flashy presentation can getboring.andM;Lastly, said several developers, improvements are coming.andP;  Multimediacontinues to capture users' interest, even among those who may scoff at it,so developers seem eager to continue making the technology more seamless andeasier to use.andP;  According to a few developers in the know, MacroMind'sforthcoming Director Interactive, a new version of HyperCard and an upgradeof SuperCard, all scheduled for release this year, should provide a fullerrange of tools and faster operation.andP;  That should help keep production costsin line and make producing multimedia on the Macintosh more accessible.andM;It's true you do get what you pay for, but you don't always have to pay themost to get the best.andP;  Personal style and budget are important considerationswhen choosing your multimedia system.andM;Producer John B. deLorimier Jr.andP;  sits down to work at a Mac II with 8 Mbytesof RAM ($8,867) with an Apple video card ($648) and 13-inch Apple monitor($999).andP;  &quot;Big screens are nice,&quot; he said, &quot;but they're slower.&quot; To this basicconfiguration he has added an Apple scanner ($1,799), AppleCD SC CD-ROM drive($1,199), Farallon Computing's Mac-Recorder ($249) and a Mass Microsys-tems45-Mbyte removable cartridge drive ($1,799.95 to $4,799.95).andP;  Local outputcomes from an ImageWriter ($595) and a set of stereo speakers.andM;DeLorimier's usual software tools include Adobe Illustrator ($495), AdobeType Manager ($99), Electronic Arts' Studio/8 ($495.95), Farallon'sSoundEdit, Letraset's ImageStudio ($495), Macro-Mind Director ($695),Paracomp's Swivel 3D ($495), and Apple's HyperCard and HyperScan software.andM;Joe Lin, art director for Animatrix, said a typical workstation there has aMac IIcx with 8 Mbytes of RAM ($8,667), a 13-inch Apple monitor and a 19-inchSuperMac Technology monitor ($4,200) for the big picture.andP;  Dual SuperMac harddrives ($3,499 to $6,999) plus a Mass Microsystems 45-Mbyte removablecartridge drive provide storage.andM;Animatrix also might plug in one of its AppleCD SC CD-ROM drives, an Apple orHowtek scanner ($6,995 to $8,195), Farallon's MacRecorder, or a TruevisionNuVista card ($2,995 to $6,495).andM;For software, Lin said, Animatrix also tends to favor HyperCard, Director andVideoWorks Interactive, Studio/8, Swivel 3D and SoundEdit.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
