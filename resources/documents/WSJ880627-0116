Small businessmen who compete with these commercial ventures claim they can't meet the prices the charities charge because taxes boost their costs.    To date, however, Congress has ignored what is by far the biggest and possibly the most damaging business activity by tax-exempt institutions: securities and futures trading. Chairman Thomas Dittmer of Refco, the largest futures and options broker, and in his time one of the most active players in the Chicago pits, says that unfair competition by these tax-exempt traders was the reason he abandoned trading for his own account.    The rule against tax exemption for &quot;unrelated business activites&quot; of charitable enterprise goes back to a claim by New York University in the 1940s that Mueller's Macaroni went off the government's tax rolls when a grateful alumnus left the company to the university in his will. The Supreme Court agreed, and Congress sensibly revised the law.    Tax-exempt institutions own more than one-quarter of the value of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and do about half the trading. Long-term investing by such institutions is a form of contract savings, and augments the depth and breadth of the market, benefiting industry and other investors. The tax exemption for dividends and long-term profits earned by such funds clearly serves public purposes.    Trading in and out of the market, however, is at least as much of a business as pasta making -- and a zero-sum game against other market participants, to boot. In such a game, tax exemption gives the pension funds and endowments a big edge. &quot;The pension funds have to be the only players left in the world,&quot; said Mr. Dittmer of Refco. &quot;Because they don't pay taxes, they have to wind up with all the money.&quot;    The huge baskets of stocks these funds try to move quickly are the greatest single source of the new and extreme volatility during the trading day. So-called &quot;index funds,&quot; which own almost all the stocks in one of the indexes traded in futures and options markets, have done particularly grave damage. Because these funds are valued daily at the closing price of the stocks in the index, they put in large orders to be executed &quot;at the close,&quot; which give the giant brokerage firms and the middlemen who work with them endless opportunities to create sure-thing trades for themselves in and between markets. (This is what Donald Regan meant when he said the markets were &quot;rigged.&quot;)    Pension funds are the source of most of the &quot;index arbitrage&quot; that bedevils the stock market. For reasons related to the costs of buying stocks and operating even an &quot;informationless&quot; investment company, such funds would underperform the market they are supposed to duplicate if they could not capitalize on the discounts or premiums that open up between the trading in derivative instruments (futures and options) and the trading in actual stocks. The market then jumps about because speculators who in the past leaned against the wind, following the old stock-market rule that the public overreacts to news, now seek to run ahead of it, following the commodities market rule that the trend is your friend.    There is also a serious if rarely considered theoretical objection to large-scale trading by funds that buy or sell &quot;the market&quot; rather than individual stocks. The economic purpose of a stock market, after all, is to guide investors and lenders to the industries and companies that a wide variety of moneyed mankind considers the most likely to prosper in the years ahead. Companies that do well in the market can raise new money for expansion or modernization more easily and more cheaply than companies that do badly in the market.    But if prices of individual securities are affected less by a company's success or failure than by movements of &quot;the market&quot; as a whole, which began to happen in 1987, then investors will cease gathering the information that permits them to measure the prospects of one company and industry against another. The director of equities research for one of the largest investment houses said recently it had been three years since anyone came to his shop out of a graduate program and said there was an industry he wanted to study.    In the U.S. stock markets over the past year, someone who bought at the top of a day's range and sold six months later at the bottom of that day's range would probably have been a loser even if the average price of his stock during the day he sold was up at a 10% or 12% annual rate from its price on the day he bought it. Under these circumstances, not only the duffers but the experienced people whose opinions the market needs will withdraw. At the end of the day, the legitimacy of the market as a guide to investments will be called into question, and the most powerful of capitalist tools will lose its cutting edge.    The government cannot and should not forbid the construction or trading of funds that seek to boost their income by trading -- but surely there is no reason to subsidize them. As the Anchor Group of 15 medium-size regional brokerage houses recently argued in a submission to Congress, competition between tax-exempt and taxable entities not only offends the instinct of fairness but harms private investors and public perception of the markets.    By defining trading as a business not related to providing pensions for General Motors employees or grants to beneficiaries of the Rockefeller Foundation, Congress or the IRS could take a big step toward restoring real liquidity and meaningful rather than merely theoretical efficiency to our stock markets.    ---   Mr. Mayer's most recent book is &quot;Markets&quot; (W.W. Norton 1988). </TEXT></DOC>
