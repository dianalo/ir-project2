Alberto Romulo.   Romulo made the statement during a public hearing on last week'sreport given by Sen. Ernesto Herrera alleging that at least 17military officials are protecting drug syndicates.   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,admitted during the hearing that there are military men involved indrug rings, but he said officials are doing their best to weed themout.   At least 40 officers have been ousted since Herrera's report andassigned to combat units fighting communist guerrillas in thecountryside, Montano added.   He said the drug problem has grown swiftly in the last fewyears. Most drug syndicates operating in Asia's so-called ``GoldenTriangle'' of Burma, Laos and Thailand use the Philippines as arelay point to Australia, the United States, Italy, Iran and someAsian countries, he said.   A total of 2,543 people were arrested for various drug-relatedoffenses last year, and 1,884 were arrested from January toSeptember this year, Montano said.   But Sen. Romulo said most of those arrested and convicted weresmall-time pushers, and none of the three major local drug groups'leaders or their top managers has been arrested.   Col. Virgilio David, chief of the Constabulary's NarcoticsCommand, said he plans to change men under his command as often aspossible to prevent them from fraternizing with drug ring members.   ``The temptation is just too great for soldiers whose averagesalary is about 80 pesos ($3.60) a day,'' David said.   During the hearing, Herrera played the first of at least 15tapes of interviews with drug pushers, military and police officerswho gave names of officers involved in corruption involving thedrug trade.</TEXT></DOC>
