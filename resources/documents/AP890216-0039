Sakharov says he ispulling out of the race for a territorial seat in the new nationallegislature because he believes he should represent the SovietAcademy of Sciences.   The prestigious academy's governing body last month rejectedSakharov's candidacy, a move that critics of the new electoralsystem said showed entrenched Communist Party bureaucrats' advantagein the nominating process.   ``I feel that I am inseparably linked with the academy, of whichI have been a member 35 years,'' Sakharov said in a letter publishedWednesday in the Moscow News.   The 67-year-old physicist, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace prize,has been nominated to represent a Moscow district in the new2,250-seat Congress of People's Deputies.   But hundreds of his colleagues at the academy want him torepresent them.   ``I have come to the conclusion that I should be a candidatenamely of the academy in the new elections or not be one at all,''Sakharov wrote in the letter to the weekly newspaper.   ``Therefore, I am taking the decision not to run anywhere exceptthe Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., withdrawing my consent torun from all territorial and national-territorial districts whichfielded my candidacy.''   The new congress, announced in December by Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev, will meet annually and choose the Sovietpresident and members of a new, smaller and more active sittingparliament, or Supreme Soviet.   A third of the deputies are to be chosen from among candidatesnominated not on the traditional basis of geographic districts butfrom the party, unions, professional organizations and otherofficially recognized groups.   Candidates may not espouse views contrary to the constitution,which enshrines the Communist Party as the leading force in society,and there has been considerable controversy over how some of thecandidates have been chosen.   The territorial deputies will be chosen by voters on March 26.Deputies from public organizations will be elected at meetings ofthose groups in the weeks preceding the territorial balloting.   On Feb. 2, more than 1,000 Academy of Sciences workers rallied toprotest the organization's rejection of the candidacies of Sakharovand several other prominent intellectuals.   They said the academy leadership had failed to listen to thepopular will.   In a letter accompanying Sakharov's Wednesday in Moscow News,space scientist Roald Sagdeyev said he supported his colleague'sdecision to pull out of the race and hoped the academy leadershipwould reverse its decision and ``find a way'' to nominate Sakharov.   Sagdeyev also was passed over as an academy nominee.   Sakharov, who is currently visiting Canada, was freed frominternal exile in Gorky in December 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
