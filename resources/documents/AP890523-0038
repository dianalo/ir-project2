A federal court on Monday convicted lobbyist Lewis Dischner andconsultant Carl Mathisen in Alaska's longest criminal trial.   The advisers to former Borough Mayor Eugene Brower used theirpositions to pocket millions in kickbacks and steer constructioncontracts to companies they secretly owned, the trial showed.   Prosecutors said payments to Dischner and Mathisen added $73million to the cost of the massive contruction program in the early1980s aimed at providing 20th Century comforts for the nation'snorthernmost communities.   The North Slope borough is the Eskimo-led government of the vastnorthern region of Alaska.   Dischner, 71, was convicted on 21 charges, ranging fromracketeering to extortion to wire and mail fraud. Mathisen, 56, wasconvicted on 22 similar charges. The jury acquitted Dischner onfour income tax counts.   ``We're obviously pleased,'' said U.S. Attorney Michael Spaan.``We hope that it will change the way that business is done inAlaska.''   The complex trial lasted more than seven months. The verdictcame in the fourth week of deliberations by an 11-member jury. Onejuror was dismissed after being hurt in a horseback-riding accident.   Prosecutors said Dischner and Mathisen socked away $21 millionduring Brower's administration from 1981 to 1984 _ $3 million insalaries; $9 million from contracts and $9 million from a 10percent fee assessed all companies doing business with the borough.   The government claimed Dischner and Mathisen manipulated Brower,an inexperienced leader whom they had helped elect. Browertestified for the government as part of plea-bargain that includeda 30-day sentence and a $5,000 fine for tax evasion.   Defense lawyers attributed the inflated cost of the borough'scapital construction to harsh arctic conditions, a rush to finishthe work and the Brower administration's desire to create jobs.   Federal racketeering statutes under which Dischner and Mathisenwere prosecuted allow the government to seek forfeiture of moneyand property obtained illegally.   Lawyers for the pair said they will appeal.   Sentencing was scheduled for August or September. Dischner andMathisen will remain free on personal recognizance until then, saidU.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland.</TEXT></DOC>
