First, it passed H.R. 1, the clean-water bill. Cost: $20 billion, including $18 billion to pay sewage-treatment-plant construction workers all across the land. The president said he was willing to sign a bill committing $12 billion (a k a, $12,000,000,000) for sewage treatment. Criticizing the $8 billion difference, the president vetoed the clean-water bill. Congress overrode the veto.    Next, the highway bill. Congress voted $88 billion to help pay construction workers and contractors to repair the highway system. About $18 billion of that, however, will subsidize further construction of some extremely questionable mass-transit projects. For good measure, Congress tossed in $900 million for more than 150 highway &quot;demonstration projects.&quot; Saying he would have been happy to spend $70 billion on all this infrastructure, the president vetoed H.R. 2. Congress overrode the veto.    After failing these first two tests of fiscal resolve, Congress next turns to the housing bill. Cost: $38 billion. The Senate approved the bill and sent it to the House last week. It authorizes $450 million over two years for the Urban Development Action Grants program, some $20 million for the Farmers Home Administration rural-housing program, and a new homeowner assistance program providing interest-free loans up to $15,000 for middle-income home buyers.    There is no justification for the current UDAG program. It hands out federal tax dollars to big developers, who build hotels, office complexes, condominiums and shopping malls. To receive a UDAG, municipalities are supposed to prove that a project wouldn't be undertaken without the federal subsidy. A 1982 HUD study indicated that up to half of UDAG projects would have happened without the money. (The program's original reason for being, to encourage development in economically distressed areas, got lost at the trough.) The rural-housing program and no-interest mortgage subsidies are similarly flawed -- both would primarily benefit middle-class people.    These three bills reveal the perversity of the current budget process. Certain line items orginally intended to be temporary -- sewage treatment plant construction grants, highway demonstration projects, urban-development grants -- evolve into permanent programs. Congress embeds these items in the political culture by distributing the pork to as many states and districts as possible. Marginal boondoggles become subsidized entitlements. Lobbies emerge in Washington to wail in public that these programs are now sacred.    The House and Senate are now moving their full budget resolutions, each incorporating some $18 billion of undefined new taxes. The votes on the budgets, like the votes on the three large bills described above, will be represented to the public as little more than tests of Ronald Reagan's personal political authority. But they are more than that.    Each of these three bills mandates outlays by a significant margin beyond what the president was willing to spend. Moreover, the impulse to vote pork and patronage obviously knows no ideology; Republicans are participating in this process, content to belong to a party that represents nothing coherent. Congress, in short, is 535 separate incumbents servicing a huge galaxy of constituencies.    Against this array of pleadings, the president is elected to represent the nation as a single interest. It's in that capacity that a president proposes to spend $70 billion on highways, not $88 billion. The battle will be renewed, with more vetoes and more bipartisan efforts to override, when Congress returns. We'll learn through this year whether federal spending in the U.S. functions under a balance of powers, or whether a theoretically two-party Congress has become the only spending power that matters. </TEXT></DOC>
