The original rule,which was promulgated on November 25, 1983, covered employees exposed tohazardous chemicals in the manufacturing sector of industry. The modifiedrule expanded coverage to all employees exposed to hazardous chemicals,thus providing protection for those in non-manufacturing employments aswell as manufacturing.The HCS requires employers to establish hazard communication programs totransmit information on the hazards of chemicals to their employees bymeans of labels on containers, material safety data sheets, and trainingprograms. Implementation of these hazard communication programs will reducethe incidence of chemically-related occupational illnesses and injuries.An advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) on expansion of the scopehad been published on November 27, 1985 (50 FR 48794). OSHA was subsequentlydirected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to issue afinal standard to expand the scope of industries covered by the rule withinsixty days of its decision issued on May 29, 1987, <T3>United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC </T3>v. <T3>Pendergrass, </T3>819 F.2d 1263 (3d Cir. 1987), unless the Agency coulddemonstrate that such an expansion would not be feasible. The August finalrule was OSHA's response to the Court's direction. However, the Agencyrecognized that had the standard been developed through a more completerulemaking process, additional information regarding the feasibility orpracticality of the provisions may have been included in the record. OSHAtherefore established a sixty-day comment period on the final rule to permitinterested parties to provide data or evidence regarding the feasibilityor practicality of the provisions of the rule.This NPRM proposes modifications to the final rule based upon informationsubmitted to the rulemaking record, including a determination made by theOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Actregarding the information collection requirements of the final rule. OSHAis inviting comment for sixty (60) days following publication of this NPRM,and is scheduling a public hearing to provide an opportunity for additionalinput.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments concerning the proposed standard and notices ofintention to appear at the public hearing must be received on or beforeOctober 7, 1988.

History of OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard </ITAG>The development of OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) was initiatedin 1974. The process has been lengthy and is discussed in detail in thepreambles to both the original and revised final rules (<T3>see </T3>48 FR 53280-81 and 52 FR 31852-54). This discussion will focuson the sequence of events which have occurred since the original finalrule was filed at the Federal Register in 1983.Petitions for judicial review of the rule were filed in the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the Third Circuit (hereinafter referred to as the ``theCourt'' or ``the Third Circuit'') on November 22, 1983, by the United Steelworkersof America, AFL-CIO-CLC, and by Public Citizen, Inc., representing itselfand a number of labor groups. Motions to intervene in these cases werereceived from the Chemical Manufacturers Association, the American PetroleumInstitute, the National Paint and Coatings Association, and the Statesof New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In addition, petitions for reviewof the standard were filed by the State of Massachusetts in the First Circuit;the State of New York in the Second Circuit; the State of Illinois in theSeventh Circuit; the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers' Association in theFourth Circuit; and the Fragrance Materials Association in the Districtof Columbia Circuit. These cases were subsequently transferred to the ThirdCircuit and consolidated into one proceeding. The cases brought by theFlavor and Extract Manufacturers' Association and the Fragrance MaterialsAssociation were withdrawn prior to filing briefs. The Court issued its initial decision on the challenges to the rule onMay 24, 1985 (<T3>United Steelworkers of America </T3>v. <T3>Auchter, </T3>763 F.2d 728 (3d Cir. 1985)). (<T3>See </T3>Ex. 4-21.) The standard was upheld in most respects, but threeissues were remanded to the Agency for reconsideration. The decision wasnot appealed.First, the Court concluded that the definition of trade secrets incorporatedby OSHA included chemical identity information that was readily discoverablethrough reverse engineering and, therefore, was ``broader than the protectionafforded trade secrets by state law.'' The Court directed the Secretaryof Labor to reconsider a trade secret definition which would not includechemical identity information that is readily discoverable through reverseengineering. Secondly, the Court held the trade secret access rule in thestandard invalid insofar as it limited access to health professionals,but found the access rule otherwise valid. The Secretary was directed toadopt a rule permitting access by employees and their collective bargainingrepresentatives to trade secret chemical identities. OSHA complied withthe Court orders regarding the two trade secret issues in a separate rule,published in final form on September 30, 1986 (51 FR 34590). The revisedtrade secret provisions were incorporated into the test of the final rulepublished on August 24, 1987.The third issue remanded to OSHA involved the scope of industries coveredby the standard. The original HCS applied to employers and employees inthe manufacturing sector. The Court directed the Secretary of Labor toreconsider the standard's application to employees in other industry sectors,and ``to order its application in those sectors unless he can state reasonswhy such application would not be feasible.'' 763 F.2d at 739, 743.OSHA subsequently published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR)to collect comments and information on the expansion of the scope to coverthese additional sectors (50 FR 48795; November 27, 1985). In particular,the Agency sought information on the extent employers in non-manufacturingindustries have already implemented various aspects of a hazard communicationprogram. In addition, OSHA wanted to obtain data regarding the applicabilityof the provisions as written in the original rule to these other sectors.A total of 226 responses were received. (<T3>See </T3>Ex. 2.) OSHA also commissioned a study of the economic impactof extending the HCS to the fifty major non-manufacturing industry groupswithin its jurisdiction. (<T3>See </T3>Exs. 4-1 and 4-2.) Based on this newly acquired evidence,as well as the previous rulemaking record, OSHA was in the process of draftinga proposed rule.On January 27, 1987, however, the United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLCand Public Citizen, Inc., petitioners in the 1985 challenge, filed a MotionFor An Order Enforcing the Court's Judgment and Holding Respondent in CivilContempt. Petitioners claimed that the Court's 1985 order had not authorizedOSHA to embark on further fact gathering, and that OSHA should have madea feasibility determination based upon the 1985 rulemaking record. Petitionersalso argued that even if further fact gathering had been allowed by theCourt's order, OSHA's pace was unduly slow.In response, OSHA noted that the Court's 1985 order did not specify thatOSHA should act on the then-existing record. OSHA believed that seekingfurther evidence on feasibility in non-manufacturing was appropriate inlight of its statutory obligation to issue rules that are well groundedin a factual record. OSHA also asserted that, consistent with Supreme Courtprecedent, the Agency should be permitted to exercise its discretion indetermining the appropriate rulemaking procedures for complying with theCourt's remand order. Lastly, the Agency argued that its schedule to completethe rulemaking was reasonable and did not constitute undue delay.On May 29, 1987, the Court issued a decision holding that the Court's 1985remand order required consideration of the feasibility of an expanded standardwithout further rulemaking. <T3>United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC </T3>v.<T3> Pendergrass.</T3> 819 F.2d 1263 (3d Cir. 1987). (<T3>See </T3>Ex. 4-20.) The Court declared that adequate notice had beenprovided to non-manufacturers during the original rulemaking that theymight be covered by the HCS, <T3>id</T3>. at 1265-1266, 1269, that the answers to the remaining questionsOSHA may have had regarding feasibility were ``self-evident'' or ``readilyascertainable'' from the original record, <T3>id</T3>. at 1268-69, and that further fact finding was ``unnecessary'',<T3>id</T3>. at 1268. The Court ordered the Agency to issue, within 60days of its order, ``a hazard communication standard applicable to allworkers covered by the OSHA Act, including those which have not been coveredin the hazard communication standard as presently written, or a statementof reasons why, on the basis of the present administrative record, a hazardcommunication standard is not feasible.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 1270.OSHA subsequently re-evaluated the evidence in the record and determinedthat a modified final rule covering all employers subject to the Act (<T3>i.e.</T3>, both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing) was both necessaryand feasible. The Agency therefore issued the final rule on Hazard Communicationwhich was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 24, 1987.The only modifications OSHA made to the original rule in the August revisionwere those that were related to expansion of the scope. If the Agency hadbeen able to publish a NPRM at that point, it had planned to propose othermodifications based upon the ANPR comments as well as OSHA's considerableexperience in implementing the original rule, and the experiences of OSHA-approvedState Plan States in implementing the HCS in the non-manufacturing sector.Publication of a final rule precluded any actions other than those specificallyrequired by the expansion, particularly since the Court determined thatthe record it reviewed (exhibits collected through November 1983) was asufficient basis for the final rule. Thus evidence collected subsequentto that time was merely cited as additional substantiation for the expansion.The revised final rule expanded the scope of industries covered from justthe manufacturing sector to all industries where employees are exposedto hazardous chemicals. As OSHA stated at the time, the Agency has evidenceto indicate that there is chemical exposure in every type of industry andthus employees in all industries must have protection under the rule. (<T3>See</T3> 52 FR 31858.)As noted earlier, although the standard was issued as a final rule, OSHAinvited interested parties to submit information, data or evidence regardingthe feasibility or practicality of the provisions as written when appliedto the non-manufacturing sector, as well as any recommendations for furthermodification. A 60 day period was established for such comments, and itended on October 23, 1987. A total of 136 comments were received (39 ofthem were received after the deadline), and entered into Docket H-022D.A variety of opinions were expressed in the comments regarding a numberof issues, however, most of the comments did not contain data or evidenceconcerning either feasibility or practicality. Many of the comments werequestions or requests for classification of the provisions.OSHA is proposing some modifications it believes are appropriate to addressconcerns raised and clarify the requirements. The Agency is also providingclarification regarding other issues in this preamble discussion. The Agencyis, of course, always prepared to respond to any specific questions fromthe regulated community regarding compliance. To this end, OSHA has appointeda Hazard Communication Coordinator in each Regional Office to whom suchquestions should be directed. Instructions to OSHA's compliance staff regardingenforcement of the HCS also include interpretations and many employershave found these documents to be useful to them in complying with the rule.These instructions are included in the docket as Ex. 4-24, and copies maybe obtained from OSHA's Publication Officer, (202) 523-9667. A bookletsummarizing the rule's provisions is also available and may be used byemployers in training workers regarding the requirements of the rule (thepublication number is OSHA 3084 Revised).In addition to the comments submitted to OSHA, the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) convened a public meeting under the Paperwork ReductionAct (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) to address the information collection requirementsof the expanded rule. The transcript of the OMB public meeting (which washeld on October 16, 1987) is entered in the docket as comment 5-76, andother relevant documents (<T3>e.g.</T3>, copies of statements, etc.) are entered in Exhibit 6. (Inaddition, the transcript of an April 2, 1987, public meeting on the informationcollection requirements for the manufacturing sector is Ex. 4-3.) The majorityof the participants in OMB's October 16 meeting submitted written commentsto OSHA as well, so there is considerable duplication in Exhibit 6 of opinionsthat had already been expressed by the same parties in other parts of therulemaking record.In a letter sent to the Department of Labor on October 28, 1987, and subsequentlypublished by OSHA in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 4, 1987 (52 FR 46075) (Ex. 4-67),OMB, under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>), disapproved certain information collection requirementsin the expanded scope rule, as of the rule's effective date (May 23, 1988),based upon the record of the October 16 public meeting and the previousmeeting on April 2, 1987 regarding the information collection requirementsfor the manufacturing sector, as well as OSHA's preamble to its August24 rule and its justification submitted formally under the Paperwork ReductionAct. The October 28 letter stated that OMB disapproved: (1) The requirementthat material safety data sheets be provided on multi-employer worksites;(2) coverage of any consumer product that falls within the ``consumer products''exemption included in section 311(e)(3) of the Superfnd Amendments andReauthorization Act of 1986; and (3) coverage of any drugs regulated bythe Food and Drug Administration in the non-manufacturing sector. In addition,OMB determined that OSHA should reopen the rulemaking on the HCS to consideralternatives to the definition of ``article'' which was included in boththe original and revised final rules. Lastly, OMB conditioned paperworkapproval upon OSHA's consulting with the U.S. Small Business Administrationand the Department of Commerce in order to develop a plan for a Federaladministrative effort that will provide assistance to the regulated industriesto alleviate paperwork burdens and costs. For a complete description ofOMB's rationale for these determinations, <T3>see</T3> the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of December 4, 1987 (52 FR 46075). Thisdocument will only summarize the positions taken by OMB.On April 13, 1988, OMB extended its approval of all information collectionrequirements in the HCS through April 1991, except that OMB continued todisapprove the three provisions previously disapproved, 53 FR 15033. OMB'sapproval of the existing definition of ``article'' was limited to the clarificationincluded in a January 14, 1988, letter from Assistant Secretary for OccupationalSafety and Health John Pendergrass to OMB, which stated that ``absent evidencethat releases of such very small quantities could present a health hazardto employees, the article exception to the rule's requirements would apply.''In response to commenters who requested that OMB not extend approval toany requirements in the non-manufacturing sector, OMB also stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The concerns of these commenters are largely based on the possibilitythat the standard and OMB's decision under the PRA will change dramaticallyas a result of the rulemaking. Although change is always possible, anysuch change would be fully considered during the rulemaking process. Ofcourse, in order for OMB to grant PRA approvals, any changes must offersufficient practical utility to justify any incremental paperwork burdenthey impose, including the burden of revising already-developed writtenprograms. Moreover, as stated above, we are continuing to disapprove thepreviously-disapproved provisions; the rulemaking should of course conformthe rule to these disapprovals.</ITAG>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act and the implementing regulationsfor that Act (5 CFR 1320.13(g) and 1320.14 (f) and (g)), OSHA is reopeningthe rule on all of the issues raised by OMB in its letter in order to havean opportunity to fully discuss the complete current record on each item,as well as to collect additional data from the public. The issues and alternativesfor dealing with them are described further below. OSHA is also proposingcertain minor modifications, described below, and invites comment on themas well.Regarding OMB's requirement that OSHA develop a plan to assist the regulatedcommunity with the paperwork associated with the HCS, the Agency is inthe process of developing compliance assistance materials. These includeOSHA 3084, a booklet explaining the provisions of the rule, and a compliancekit designed to help employers come into compliance. The compliance kitwill be made available through the Government Printing Office within afew months. A press release will provide information about obtaining acopy at such time as it becomes available. For further information, pleasecontact OSHA's Office of Information and Consumer Affairs, (202) 523-8151.The revised final rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appealsby the Associated Builders and Contractors, National Grain and Feed Association,Associated General Contractors of Virginia, Associated General Contractorsof America, and United Technologies Corporation. A number of interestedparties have intervened in these cases as well. The challenges are in thepreliminary stages of adjudication at this point, and generally involvethe appropriateness of OSHA's publishing a final rule in response to theThird Circuit's order.Although these cases were originally consolidated in the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, they were transferred tothe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on May 20, 1988. The caseswere transferred to the Third Circuit because the ``revised [HCS] was promulgatedin response to orders by the Third Circuit * * * and petitioners have raisedissues similar to those already considered by that court.''On June 24, 1988, the Third Circuit granted a stay of the standard as itapplies to the construction industry (29 CFR 1926.59) pending the outcomeof the litigation challenging the rule. The rule is in effect for all otheremployers in both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors. OSHApublished a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 22, 1988 (53 FR 27679) to provide affectedemployers further information regarding the applicability of the stay andenforcement of the rule.In addition to these challenges of the revised HCS, the United Steelworkersof America, AFL-CIO-CLC, and Public Citizen have filed a motion with theThird Circuit requesting the court to order that OSHA enforce all of therevised HCS including the three requirements OMB disapproved under authorityof the Paperwork Reduction Act. OSHA will continue to abide by the OMBdecision and will not enforce the disapproved requirements unless otherwiseordered by the Court.<T3>Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH). </T3>Asdiscussed in the preamble to the August 1987 final rule (52 FR 31858-59),the ACCSH reviewed a draft notice of proposed rulemaking to expand thescope of the HCS to construction on June 23, 1987. The ACCSH went throughthe NPRM line-by-line, making recommendations to adapt it to the constructionindustry, <T3>i.e., </T3>the document with the recommended changes constituted anACCSH recommended standard for hazard communication. A number of the recommendationswere adopted (<T3>e.g., </T3>the definition of workplace was modified to include jobsites or projects; the written hazard communication program requirementswere amended to clearly state that the programs are to be maintained atthe site).As this NPRM addresses issues that affect construction, OSHA transmitteda draft of it to the ACCSH for review and comment. In a meeting on March30, 1988, the ACCSH did not provide specific recommendations on the NPRM.The ACCSH reiterated its desire to have a separate standard for construction,and appointed a subcommittee to make further recommendations to the AssistantSecretary. However, the ACCSH also reaffirmed that the standard as writtenshould be implemented as scheduled on May 23, 1988.The three primary issues in this NPRM that affect construction_the definitionof ``article,'' the coverage of consumer products, and the maintenanceof material safety data sheets on multi-employer worksites_were all previouslyconsidered by the ACCSH on June 23, 1987.With regard to the definition of ``article,'' the ACCSH recommended thatthe definition state that vapors, mists, gases, and fumes are not to beconsidered articles (Tr. 97-8). As OSHA explained during the meeting, thosetypes of materials do not meet the definition in any event, and would notbe considered articles. Thus there is no need for that particular modification.There were no further comments on the definition or its application tothe construction industry during that meeting.The ACCSH also reviewed OSHA's proposed exemption for consumer products,<T3>i.e., </T3>that consumer products be exempt where the employer candemonstrate it is used in the workplace in the same manner as normal consumeruse, and which use results in a duration and frequency of exposure whichis not greater than exposures experienced by consumers. A motion was initiallymade to modify the exemption to allow consumer products used ``as approvedfor consumer use, and which will not result in any duration or frequencyof exposure which is greater than applicable threshold limit values forany hour of use.'' Tr. 81. After further discussion regarding the lackof a mechanism for ``approval'' for consumer use that would apply in thissituation, and the lack of threshold limit values for the majority of chemicalsin the workplace, the ACCSH voted to approve an amended exemption whichreads ``where the employer can demonstrate it is used in the workplacein the same manner as recommended for consumer use, and which will notresult in any duration and frequency of exposure, which is greater thanexposures experienced by consumers.'' Tr. 90.The ACCSH also reviewed the requirement for maintenance of material safetydata sheets on multi-employer worksites, and did not object to such a provisionor indicate that it would be infeasible or unnecessary to have such a requirement.In fact, the committee further recommended that it be made explicit thatwritten programs be maintained at the worksite, a recommendation that OSHAadopted.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Summary and Explanation of the Issues and the Provisions of theNotice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>The regulatory text presented in this document only addresses the proposedmodifications, rather than reprinting the entire standard and incorporatingthe proposed changes. Since the HCS is lengthy and complicated, OSHA believesthat this will make it easier for interested parties to identify the proposedmodifications and provide appropriate comment. When the final rule is promulgated,OSHA will reprint the entire text including the modified provisions.The discussion which follows is also limited primarily to the proposedchanges and related issues. It does not provide a complete summary andexplanation of all of the provisions of the rule_for such information interestedparties should refer to the preambles of the original (48 FR 53334-40)and revised (52 FR 31860-67) final rules. There are also discussions ofalternatives to the proposed modifications which have been suggested toOSHA. OSHA is inviting comment on these as well as the regulatory textitself. While the purpose of this rulemaking is principally to resolvethe issues presented by the proposed and alternative provisions, OSHA isalso interested in receiving comment on other issues that may be relatedto the proposal. In order to assist OSHA in its development of the finalHCS in the nonmanufacturing sector, comment will also be accepted and consideredconcerning the entire rule's application to the nonmanufacturing sector.As most interested parties are aware, the rulemaking record on this standardis quite extensive, and all of the material submitted to date will be consideredin development of the new final rule. It is therefore not necessary, ordesirable, to repeat comments previously provided unless there is new data,evidence or other information available concerning the arguments made.In reopening the record, OSHA recognizes that it is not operating ``ona clean slate.'' In developing the existing standard, OSHA had the benefitof an extensive evidentiary record. In addition, the Agency's experiencegained under the original standard, as well as under State standards, someof which already applied to the nonmanufacturing sector, further supportedOSHA's current standard. As explained in detail below, OSHA continues tobelieve that the record substantially justified the Agency's regulatorychoices, and the information presented to OSHA after the standard was issuedhas, by and large, not convinced OSHA that significant changes are warrantedto comply with the OSH Act.In this rulemaking, OSHA is seeking additional information on whether theseregulatory choices also meet the criteria of the Paperwork Reduction Act.If information collected in the course of this rulemaking responds to theconcerns raised by OMB on these issues in its October 28, 1987, letter,OSHA will request that OMB reconsider its paperwork decision on these issues.OSHA will also consider requesting paperwork approval for other optionssubstantially supported by the record, as well as conforming the finalrule to OMB's paperwork decisions.OMB has published implementing regulations at 5 CFR 1320.4(b) which statethat, to obtain OMB approval of a collection of information, an agencyshall demonstrate that it has taken every reasonable step to ensure that:(1) The collection of information is the least burdensome for the properperformance of the agency's functions to comply with legal requirementsand achieve program objectives;(2) The collection of information is not duplicative of information otherwiseaccessible to the agency; and,(3) The collection of information has practical utility. Commenters tothe record should focus on these criteria in this rulemaking.OSHA will fully comply with the Paperwork Reduction Act, which prohibitsagencies from ``conducting or sponsoring'' a collection of informationwithout OMB approval. Hence, the provisions disapproved by OMB will beneither effective nor enforceable until OSHA completes this rulemaking.It should be noted, however, that OSHA retains ``almost unlimited discretionto devise means to achieve the Congressionally mandated goal.'' <T3>United Steelworkers of America </T3>v. <T3>Marshall. </T3>647 F.2d 1189, 1230 (D.C. Cir. 1980), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>453 U.S. 913 (1981). <T3>Accord, Building and Construction Trades Dept., ALF-CIO </T3>v. <T3>Brock, </T3>838 F.2d 1258, 1271 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The expectationsof the manufacturing sector, which has been subject to the HCS since 1985,are settled, as are those of the nonmanufacturing sector, which has beenpreparing to comply with the present standard since August 1987, and withthe paperwork requirements as approved by OMB since October 1987. Therefore,OSHA does not expect the standard to further change significantly unlessthe Agency is presented with substantial evidence that a regulatory modificationis clearly necessary, either because the present standard is demonstrablyinfeasible in a specific respect, or because the proposed alternative wouldsignificantly increase the standard's intended safety and health benefitor significantly improve its cost-effectiveness. Employers must plan accordinglyto fulfill their compliance obligations under the standard as it is currentlyapproved and should not anticipate undue delay in its enforcement.Comments submitted should clearly identify the provisions being addressed,the rationale for the position taken, and data or evidence in support ofthat rationale.The discussion which follows is organized by paragraph of the standardfor ease of reference. It is suggested that comments submitted be presentedin the same fashion.Scope and Application<T3>Scope of industries covered. </T3>As OSHA described in the preambleto the revised final rule (52 FR 31855-59), expansion of the protectionsafforded by the HCS to all nonmanufacturing industries is supported bythe rulemaking record. Evidence collected by OSHA indicates that thereis chemical exposure occurring in every type of industry covered (althoughevery employee may not be exposed). The Agency's position is that all suchemployees are entitled to information regarding the chemical hazards theyare exposed to in the workplace, and that a uniform Federal hazard communicationstandard is the best method to ensure that information is provided. Thisposition is consistent with the mandate of the Act (protecting all employeesto the extent feasible), as well as with the Court's decision upon reviewof the rule.Despite this explicit determination by OSHA, as well as by the Third Circuit,there were a number of comments submitted which suggested that certainindustrial sectors should be exempted from the rule, or only covered bylimited provisions.For example, the National Cosmetology Association, Inc. (Ex. 5-54) submittedcomments reiterating the position it had submitted in response to the ANPRthat all small businesses should be exempt from the requirements, and thatin particular, small cosmetology salons should be exempted. The argumentpresented was that cosmetologists are highly trained professionals andthat cosmetics are safe because they are regulated by the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA).While cosmetologists and other such skilled workers are trained to executetheir professional duties, it is not clear that they receive any trainingregarding the safe use of chemicals. To the extent that they do receivesuch training, the individual employer's duty to train will be minimized.Existence of prior training is certainly not a valid rationale for notpromulgating a requirement for training for any particular group of workers.Furthermore, the contention that products used in cosmetology salons aresafe due to regulation by the FDA is also not supported by the record.The FDA regulates products primarily for the protection of consumers, notfor the protection of professionals who are generally exposed more frequentlyand to greater levels of the hazardous chemicals involved. For furtherdiscussion of the need for hazard communication in such facilities <T3>see </T3>Exs. 2-49 and 4-50.With regard to the exemption of small businesses in general, OSHA doesnot consider it to be appropriate to determine the extent of protectionafforded an employee by the size of business he/she is employed in. Althoughthe Agency does have enforcement policies that take into considerationthe size of the business, as well as free consultation services that areprimarily intended for small employers without on-staff safety and healthcapability (<T3>see </T3>Exs. 4-38 and 4-39), such small businesses must still complywith regulations and ensure that their employees are protected to the sameextent as employees of larger businesses.Other employer representatives indicated that the degree of risk in theirparticular industry warranted either an exemption or limited coverage.(<T3>See, e.g., </T3>Ex. 5-5, eating and drinking places; Ex. 5-19, educationalinstitutions; and Ex. 5-44, agriculture.) The degree of ``risk'' encounteredoverall by employees in a given industry is also not a viable argumentfor exempting all such employees totally from coverage under the HCS. Thestandard already includes a number of exemptions and limitations of coveragethat are indirectly related to the issue of risk, <T3>e.g., </T3>limited coverage for employees who only handle chemicalsin sealed containers. The rationale for this limited coverage is basedupon the limited potential for exposure in these types of work operations.Under the HCS, the primary concern is the risk of being exposed to chemicalswithout knowing what the hazards of those chemicals are, and thus not beingsure of the proper handling procedures. The purpose of the standard isto convey those hazards, which are intrinsic properties of the chemicals,along with the appropriate handling procedures. Although risk should beaddressed in training programs where employers would be discussing extentof exposure and protective measures being implemented to reduce exposure,the extent of risk involved is not a determining factor with regard toa decision as to whether or not the information must be conveyed. Employeeshave the right-to-know that they are being exposed to a potential hazard_aslong as the potential for exposure exists in the work operation and thechemical has been demonstrated to be hazardous, the rule applies.There were also a number of comments from representatives of the constructionindustry which indicated that the protections of the rule are not necessaryin that industry because exposures to hazardous chemicals are minimal,and therefore risks are low (<T3>see</T3>. <T3>e.g.</T3>, Exs. 5-17, 5-27, 5-58 (Klug and Smith Company: ``We do nothave constant exposures to numerous hazardous chemicals and because ofthis we have a low rate of occupational illnesses * * *.''), 5-86, and5-108). Conversely, there were other construction representatives whichwere concerned that the requirements would be too burdensome because ofthe large number of hazardous chemicals on each construction site (<T3>see</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, Ex. 5-83 (American Subcontractors Association: ``In themore chemically hazardous specialty trades, such as painting, roofing andinsulation work, there could indeed be hundreds or thousands of chemicalsubstances and compounds which would require MSDSs in accordance with theprovisions of the expanded HSC''), and Ex. 5-76 (the National Associationof Home Builders): ``I have this vision of a truck pulling up to the siteand behind it is the trailer and on the trailer is the file cabinet ofMSD sheets.'' Other commenters suggested smaller numbers: Ex. 2-108, (``** * 25 typical hazardous substances found on most construction sites ** *''); Ex. 2-199 (``* * * [F]irst, no painting job will use more than30 to 60 coating materials. Many jobs required only four to eight materials* * *.'').OSHA believes that it is fair to assume that the number of chemicals oneach site will vary based upon the type and complexity of the constructioninvolved. However, in our experience, the likelihood of there being hundredsor thousands of chemicals on a particular site is very small. In conversationswith State Plan States which have already implemented the expanded scoperule, as well as with construction contractor in these states, our experienceshave been confirmed.In any event, the number of hazardous chemicals on a site, whether smallor large, is not the determining factor in terms of whether employees shouldbe provided information regarding the hazards of those chemicals. (It shouldalso be noted that very few non-manufacturing facilities would have asmany chemicals on-site as many manufacturing firms do. For example, motorvehicle manufacturing plants typically have thousands of hazardous chemicalproducts in each facility (<T3>see</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, H-022, Tr. 3678, 3691). Yet these types of employers werestrong supporters of the HCS, and in particular, the MSDS requirements.Furthermore, many already had programs to obtain MSDSs and make them availableto exposed workers. <T3>See</T3>, <T3>E.g.</T3>, Tr. 3784.) Where there are few chemicals, employers' dutieswill be minimal. Thus it would not be appropriate to exempt the constructionindustry based upon this rationale. It is interesting to note that in aBureau of Labor Statistics' survey of construction workers injured on thejob, only 23% indicated that they had received any training regarding hazardouschemicals (Ex. 2-221).There were other industry representatives who suggested that OSHA has noauthority to regulate them because their industries are covered under therequirements of other Federal agencies. For example, the American Associationof Railroads (Ex. 5-47) argued that the Department of Transportation (DOT)requirements prempt OSHA from regulating railroad employees with regardto hazard communication. DOT's applicable requirements would be under theFederal Railroad Administration (FRA).Under section 4(b)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 653(b)(1), Congress statedthat nothing in the Act would apply to ``working conditions of employeeswith respect to which other Federal agencies * * * exercise statutory authorityto prescribe or enforce standards or regulations affecting occupationalsafety or health * * *.'' The operative language in this provision is ``exercisestatutory authority.'' As a matter of policy, these issues are generallynot addressed in the regulatory language of a standard but rather are workedout between the agencies involved if a potential conflict or duplicationof effort arises, or are resolved in litigation. The situation is not staticsince the extent of preemption would change if the extent of regulationchanges. Therefore, it is not appropriate to delineate respective authoritieson a given issue in the text of a standard itself.However, to assist employers attempting to comply with the rules of morethan one Agency in this area, OSHA has decided to include in this preamblea discussion of jurisdictions in two industries, transportation and pesticides.This discussion is obviously not a definitive finding of jurisdiction,but merely restates the Agency's position regarding the areas it believesare regulated under the HCS. The primary concern to OSHA is that the protectionsafforded by hazard communication are provided to all employees, and ifthat is being done under the regulations of another Federal agency, thensection 4(b)(1) of the Act would apply and OSHA's standard would not beapplicable. If such protection is not being provided to any group of employees,then the OSHA standard would apply.In the railroad industry, OSHA standards would generally apply to thoseemployee hazards which are not related to the operation of railroads. TheFRA's program for occupational safety and health of employees addressesthree major fields of railroad operations: (1) Tracks, road beds, and associatedstructures, <T3>e.g.</T3>, bridges and signals; (2) equipment, <T3>e.g.</T3>, rolling equipment and safety appliances such as brakes andcoupling devices; and, (3) human factors, <T3>e.g.</T3>, hours of services.The American Trucking Association (Ex. 5-82) recommended that a Memorandumof Understanding be adopted by OSHA and DOT to clarify coverage. This isan option that may be pursued at a later date. The Bureau of Motor CarrierSafety (BMCS) of DOT exercises statutory authority for the operation ofcommercial motor vehicles engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. BCMSoccupational safety and health programs include equipment safety, noiseabatement, transport of hazardous materials over the nation's highways,and operators' hours of service. OSHA retains statutory authority for thoseworking conditions not covered by BMCS requirements.Another area of potential conflict raised in the comments (<T3>see</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, Exs, 5-6, 5-44, 5-50, and 5-66), involves employees exposedto pesticides. Commenters maintain that OSHA cannot cover pesticide exposuresoutside the manufacturing sector as these are regulated under the FederalInsecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136 <T3>et seq</T3>.) administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).EPA requires pesticides to be labeled, approves the specific label language,and requires the pesticides to be applied in accordance with the labelinginstructions.As OSHA sees the situation, there are jurisdictional questions regardingthree groups of workers exposed to pesticides. First, there are applicatorsof restricted use pesticides. These workers are certified and receive trainingregarding proper application. It appears to OSHA that for these workers,EPA has clearly exercised statutory authority for protecting them in thearea of hazard communication.The second group of workers are those applying non-restricted use pesticides.For these workers, protection requires that they read and act on the labelsapproved by EPA. There is some evidence to indicate this may not occur(Ex. 4-32), and that additional information sources are required to ensureappropriate protection. It certainly can be argued that material safetydata sheets and training would provide more complete, effective informationtransmittal. However, the issue of whether EPA's promulgation of a labelrequirement for a non-restricted use pesticide might prohibit OSHA fromrequiring the other provisions of the HCS_MSDSs and training_to be appliedto employees using these hazardous chemicals is a difficult one, and OSHAinvites comments and arguments to assist the Agency.The third group in question are those workers who are incidentally exposeddownstream to the pesticide residues after application, <T3>e.g.</T3>, farmworkers, grain elevator workers, and workers in furnituremanfuacturing facilities handling preserved wood. In these situations,the workers are often located at a different site from where the applicationtook place, and do not have access to label information at all. It appearsthat these workers clearly come under OSHA's jurisdiction and hazard communicationwould apply.OSHA will, however, continue to have discussions with the other Agenciesinvolved to more clearly delineate the scope of the respective regulatoryrequirements in these areas.Representatives of the agriculture industry (Exs. 5-6, 5-50) were alsoconcerned that the revised final rule did not mention the Congressionalappropriations rider under which OSHA is prohitibed from promulgating orenforcing standards on farms with 10 or fewer employees unless the farmhas a temporary labor camp. As long as this rider appears in OSHA's appropriationsbill, the protections of the HCS will not apply on those farms. However,farms with 11 or more employees, as well as those with temporary laborcamps, are covered by the rule.<T3>Labeling exemptions.</T3> The original HCS included a number of exemptionsfrom the requirements for labels on shipped containers for those hazardouschemicals that are already labeled in accordance with the requirementsof another Federal agency. In the revised final rule, OSHA added an exemptionfor medical and veterinary devices labeled in accordance with the requirementsof the Food and Drug Administration. Medical and veterinary devices hadbeen inadvertently omitted from the exemptions in the original rule (52FR 31862).The Department of Agriculture (Ex. 5-28) and the Animal Health Institute(Ex. 5-37) have requested that a specific exemption be included for labelingof veterinary biological products as well. Although these materials areconsidered to be drugs, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA),21 U.S.C. 392(b) ``defers'' regulation of some veterinary biologics tothe Department of Agriculture when the biologics are subject to the Virus-Serum-ToxinAct of 1913, 21 U.S.C. 151-58.To the extent that the hazards of these materials are biological hazards,the HCS would not apply in any event. However, there are apparently somechemicals used in the materials that would potentially be covered by theHCS (in particular, formaldehyde). OSHA is adding an exemption for labelingof these items when they are subject to the labeling requirements of eitherthe Food and Drug Administration or the Department of Agriculture. It shouldbe noted, however, that this exemption is just for labeling, and to theextent chemical hazards are present in these materials, the other provisionsof the HCS would apply in terms of employee protection.<T3>Articles</T3>. The NPRM published in March of 1982 did not includean exemption for articles. Since the rule's provisions were only intendedto apply to those substances to which employees are potentially exposed_andsubstances inextricably bound in a manufactured item do not present a potentialfor exposure_OSHA did not believe that an article exemption was necessary.However, the Agency did receive a few comments from affected manufacturersthat requested such an exemption (<T3>see </T3>H-022 Exs. 19-47, 19-73, 19-76, 19-166, 19-209, and 19-220).For example, the Standard Oil Company (Ex. 19-47) stated: ``Considerationshould be given to the possibility of exempting hazardous substances containedin articles, such as electrolyte in a battery. One might conclude thatthese are not `chemicals present in the workplace in such manner that employeesmay be exposed under normal conditions of use.' However, a definitive statementin the regulations would be preferable.'' Similarly, the National Associationof Manufacturers (Ex. 19-209) suggested that the definition of containersto be labeled not include ``articles posing no unreasonable risk'' in theworkplace: ``For example, brass billets in a storage box need no labels.However, when the billet is melted and may fume, the operating instructionsto the employee should include this hazard.'' And INCO Limited (Ex. 19-166):``The definition of `chemical' should therefore exclude manufactured itemssuch as metals, alloys, ceramics, plastic, cloth, etc. These materialsgenerally exist in such a state that they may be handled and transportedwithout creating hazards not readily recognized by all * * *.'' It wasalso suggested that OSHA might look to the definition of article used byEPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. 2601, when craftingan appropriate exemption (Ex. 19-73). Otherwise, no specific definitionswere suggested by commenters.Although inclusion of an exemption for ``articles'' was certainly not amajor issue for the manufacturers of such items during the rulemaking,OSHA decided that the addition would serve to clarify the rule's intent.Therefore an article exemption was included in both the original and revisedfinal rules. The HCS does not apply to articles in any respect. The definitionof ``article'' is ``a manufacturer item: (i) Which is formed to a specificshape or design during manufacture; (ii) which has end use function(s)dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use;and (iii) which does not release, or otherwise result in exposure to, ahazardous chemical under normal conditions of use.'' ``The purpose of thisexemption is to ensure that items which may contain hazardous chemicals,but in such a manner that employees won't be exposed to them, not be includedin the hazard communication programs.'' 48 FR 53293.OSHA's article definition was based, to a large extent, on the ``article''definition used by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under theToxic Substances Control Act (TSCA):<ITAG tagnum="21">``Article'' means a manufactured item (1) which is formed to a specificshape or design during manufacture, (2) which has end use function(s) dependentin whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use, and (3) whichhas either no change of chemical composition during its end use or onlythose changes of composition which have no commercial purpose separatefrom that of the article, and that result from a chemical reaction thatoccurs upon end use of other chemical substances, mixtures, or articles;except that fluids and particles are not considered articles regardlessof shape or design.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>See </T3>40 CFR 704.3.The first two parts of OSHA's article definition are identical to EPA'sdefinition. However, OSHA was concerned that the third part of EPA's definitionwas too broad, and if adopted, would exempt manufactured items which resultin exposure of workers to hazardous chemicals during their use in the workplace.An example of this potential deficiency in coverage was described duringthe rulemaking using formaldehyde emissions from fabrics handled in garmentmanufacturing facilities_downstream employees are exposed to formaldehydealthough the fabric would probably be considered an article under EPA'sTSCA regulations. 48 FR 53293. OSHA modified EPA's definition to ensurethat manufactured items that release, or otherwise expose workers to hazardouschemicals during normal conditions of their use in the workplace, are coveredby the HCS. This modification was necessary to adapt the definition toaddress the concerns in the workplace, which are different than EPA's purposeunder TSCA. In particular, as OSHA described in the preamble to the revisedfinal rule (52 FR 31865), it is important in terms of workplace protectionto emphasize the total exemption generally applies to items which are atthe point of ``end'' use. Normal conditions of ``use'' in the workplacemight involve exposures prior to the ultimate use of the product. The articleexemption was specifically drafted in the manner promulgated to ensurethat employers and employees have information to protect workers involvedin these intermediate workplace uses. ``Use'' under the definitions ofthe rule means to package, handle, react, or transfer. Certainly an employeeinstalling an item in such a way that an exposure results would be ``handling''the item and thus entitled to information under the rule. ``Use'' of theitem in terms of the exemption must be specifically related to the workplaceexposure of employees, not the intended purpose of the item once it isin place. It makes a considerable difference in work practices and protectivemeasures when, for example, an employer knows that the tiles his employeesare sanding all day when installing them contain lead that is becomingairborne as a result of that operation rather than just generating nuisancedust. Once the tie is installed, it is an article because there is no exposure.These intermediate ``uses'' of an article are often of concern in the constructionindustry. The Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH)reviewed the definiton of ``article'' at a meeting on June 23, 1987 (Ex.4-6): ``We believe that fundamentally the definition is pretty good, withone possible exception. And I would move that in the first line of thedefinition following the word ``fluid'' that we add the words vapor, mist,gas, fume * * *.'' This motion was accepted by the Committee. OSHA agreesthat vapors, mists, gases, and fumes are not ``articles,'' but believesthat it is quite clear than they are not covered under the current definitionso this modification is not being made.For practicality and feasibility reasons, OSHA has determined that repairof manufactured items at some point after installation is generally notconsidered to be a ``normal condition of use.'' Although employees involvedin these types of operations would certainly benefit from specific informationregarding the materials they are dealing with (as in the example of thetiles containing lead which was just described), OSHA recognizes that thetime lapse between installation and possible repair is such that it isnot reasonable to assume that written information can be maintained andmade available on that possibility. 52 FR 31865. Employers involved insuch activities must provide the best information available to them. Sincerepair may involve installation of a replacement part, having informationfor installation will somewhat alleviate the problem of not having substance-specificinformation for articles being repaired.During implementation of the original rule, OSHA received a number of questionsregarding the application of the article definition and exemption, particularlywith regard to metal casting. The responses to these questions were generallyquite clear in terms of determining whether an item was covered or not.In its instructions to compliance officers regarding enforcement of therule, OSHA provided the following guidance (Ex. 4-24):<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * The key to the definition of ``article,'' and thus the exemption,is the term ``under normal conditions of use.'' For example, an item maymeet the definition of ``article,'' but produces a hazardous byproductif burned. If burnng is not considered as part of its normal conditionsof use, the item would be an ``article'' under the standard, and thus exempted.The following items are examples of articles: Stainless steel table; Vinylupholstery; Tires. The following items are examples of products which wouldNOT be considered ``articles'' under the standard, and would thus not beexempted from the requirements: Metal ingots that will be melted undernormal conditions of use. Fabric treated with formaldehyde where downstreamgarment manufacturing employees will be exposed when making clothing. Switcheswith mercury in them when a certain percentage break under normal conditionsof use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It should be noted that the only information that has to be reportedin these situations is that which concerns the hazard of the release. Thehazardous chemicals which are still bound in the article would still beexempted under the ``article'' exemption.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These examples were based upon actual questions OSHA had receivedfrom interested parties. Despite the fact that the responses to these questionswere generally clear, OSHA determined that it would be helpful to ensurethat all interested parties were familiar with the definition and exemptionand clearly understood them. Therefore, OSHA decided to raise the issuefor comment when the ANPR was published in 1985.The vast majority of the comments received dealt with metal castings. Anumber of these simply stated that metal castings should always be consideredarticles, do not result in hazardous exposures (or if they do everyonealready knows what the hazards are), and should not be covered. <T3>(See, e.g,</T3> Exs. 2-2, 2-16, 2-20, 2-25, 2-32, 2-50, 2-65, 2-170,2-209, and 2-215.) These comments were specific to the metal castings industry,and did not address the definition of article <T3>per se</T3> except to state that it should explicitly eliminate coverageof metal castings.OSHA believes that many castings, if not most, would be articles and thusexempted from the rule (<T3>e.g.,</T3> manhole covers; frying pans; wrought iron gates). However,when a metal casting is not in finished form, and is being re-worked bya downstream employer in such a way that a hazardous chemical is released,it is not an exempted ``article.'' If the re-working is done in such away that no hazardous chemicals are released, it is an article. Under thehazard determination requirements of the rule, the firm producing the castingmust determine its normal conditions of use downstream, and whether itis exempted as an article. This requirement applies to manufacturers ofall types of products, and metal casting producers are not excepted fromthis approach.For those commenters who specified a tye of casting which they contendis an article, <T3>e.g., </T3>iron (Exs. 2-3, 2-6, 2-24, 2-27, 2-47, 2-74, and 2-136)and aluminum (Ex. 2-29)), the decision in the first instance is the manufacturer's.OSHA has made no across-the-board determination that iron or aluminum castingsare or are not articles. If, during an inspection, OSHA finds such castingsin a work situation where hazardous chemicals are being released from thecasting under normal conditons of use, we will expect the manufacturerof the casting to have provided chemical hazard information to the downstreamemployer. This also applies to other types of products which commenterssuggested should be specifically exempted as articles, <T3>e.g.,</T3> textiles (Exs. 2-40 and 2-103); rubber-like polymer (Ex.2-18); and scrap metal (Ex. 2-107).In response to OSHA's request for comments or for suggestions to modifyor clarify the definition of article, a number of commenters respondedthat the definition is workable as it is, and allows employers to applylogic and reason in their determinations (Exs. 2-59, 2-79, 2-96, 2-101,2-112, 2-154, and 2-187).For example, Daniel Construction Company (Ex. 2-59), a construction firmwhich voluntarily implemented hazard communication in its facilities priorto promulgation of the OSHA rule, stated the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">We have no problem with the current definition and exemption. It allowsfor reason and logic to be applied to the work situation. Any more detaileddefinition and exemption would cause more problems. A common material thatwe often work with, galvanized steel, illustrates how well the definitionand exemption work. When sawed, drilled, bent or bolted together, thereare only mechanical hazards involved; when heated to high temperatures,cut with a torch, or welded upon, inhalation of the resulting fume causesthe toxic response called fume fever. It would be extremely difficult towrite a more specific definition and exclusion that would cover the workwith galvanized steel and would then be applicable to a significant numberof other situations. We recommend that you leave the definition and exclusionas it is.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Daniel Construction's comment is an excellent example of the applicationof the article definition and exemption, and the need for such a delineationof use in determining the need for information about the product.The State of New Mexico, an OSHA-approved State Plan State which used thedefinition of ``article'' in its State rule, stated that ``[t]he currentdefinition of `article' is sufficient and does provide enough informationto determine what should be defined as an `article.' '' Ex. 2-79. It shouldbe noted that all of the State Plan States, as well as the non-State PlanStates with their own right-to-know laws, have adopted an identical orcomparable definition for ``article'' as the one in the OSHA standard,so it is, and has been for some years, the criterion used nationally fordetermining what manufactured items are exempted from right-to-know requirements.The current OSHA definition is also being used internationally as the Canadiangovernment, which is in the process of implementing and system to communicateinformation about hazardous materials in the workplace, has also adoptedit (Ex. 4-72).In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently promulgateda final rule entitled ``Toxic Chemical Release Reporting; Community Right-to-Know''which also incorporates the OSHA article definition. EPA had originallyproposed to use the TSCA definition. However, based on information submittedto the rulemaking record, EPA determined in the final rule that it was``more appropriate'' to use the OSHA definition since it related more specificallyto the issue of chemical releases. ``The TSCA article definition is wordedprimarily to distinguish `chemical substances' and `mixtures' from thosemanufactured items that contain chemical substances and mixtures. The OSHAHCS definition was adapted from the TSCA regulatory definition, for thepurpose of exempting certain items from the MSDS preparation requirements;the supposition being that the item's normal end use would not releaseor cause exposure to a `hazardous chemical' in the article.'' 53 FR 4507.Furthermore, Aluminum Company of America (Ex. 2-96), a manufacturer whichwould be applying the definition to its products, indicated: ``Alcoa doesnot favor further clarification of the article definition. As currentlystated, the definition provides sufficient flexibility to enable manufacturersto determine its applicability in a given circumstance. We believe suchflexibility for manufacturers is critical to maintain and, therefore, recommendthat the article definition not be modified.'' Similarly, Kaiser Aluminum,another manufacturer involved in application of the definition, concluded(Ex. 2-187): ``We believe the current definition of `article' is adequateas written. It provides the flexibility we believe is needed to determinewhether certain aluminum products are covered by the definition. We donot believe a `cut and dried' definition to be workable. Certainly considerationof foreseeable further processing as well as the products' chemical andphysical properties should determine applicability of the Standard in agiven circumstance.'' Another manufacturing representative, the Manufactured Housing Institute,similarly endorsed the existing definition (Ex. 2-101): ``* * * MHI doesnot believe that the exemption has resulted in confusion. MHI feels thatthe exemption is appropriate and should be continued.''A comment from the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU)(Ex. 2-154A), discussed the types of additional protection afforded workersin garment manufacturing facilities as a result of the article definitionas promulgated:<ITAG tagnum="21">ACTWU has experienced positive employee responses to the HCS. Employeesof downstream garment manufacturers directly benefit from the non-exemptionrequirement under the ``articles'' provision. Workers are alerted to thehazards associated with the off-gassing of hazardous chemicals from fabrics.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A recent survey conducted at a uniform manufacturing plant revealedthat some employees are experiencing symptoms associated with formaldehydeexposure. Their exposure is formaldehyde off-gassing from fabric treatedwith permanent press resins. Caution labels supplied by fabric manufacturersalerted these workers to the possible cause of their health effects * **.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The ACTWU concluded that the ``article'' definition as written, provides``a unique means through which workers are alerted to the hazards associatedwith certain end-use products and an irreplaceable mechanism of requestingadditional information.''There were several comments which suggested that the definition neededto be clarified, but no specific problems were indicated and no suggestionswere made (Exs. 2-34, 2-52, 2-56, 2-83, and 2-93). There was also a seriesof comments which either suggested adopting the entire EPA definition,or provided an alternative to the definition (<T3>see</T3>, <T3>e.g., </T3>Exs. 2-84, 2-103, 2-104, 2-106, 2-124, 2-140, 2-142, 2-145,2-147, 2-188, 2-200, and 2-211). As stated above, OSHA believes the EPAarticle definition is inappropriate for the HCS because it would exemptfrom the rule manufactured items that contain hazardous chemicals and releasethem in such a way as to expose workers under normal conditions of use.Furthermore, EPA's purpose in exempting these items because of their commercialstatus is quite different than OSHA's purpose to provide information toexposed workers, and thus a different approach is necessary. All of these alternative suggestions were in comments submitted and coordinatedby representatives of formaldehyde-related industries, such as producersof textiles and wood products which contain formaldehyde resins. Thesesame comments were submitted to the formaldehyde docket, and were consideredin the formulation of the final rule on formaldehyde. <T3>See </T3>52 FR 46168. Since formaldehyde is a specific, unique hazardouschemical used in manufactured articles, <T3>i.e.,</T3> a gas which is released from solid products, and is fairlyubiquitous in both its uses and its presence in the environment, OSHA believesit is appropriate to deal with the problems raised on a substance-specificbasis, rather than modifying a generic rule to address one situation.One alternative that was suggested by these coordinated comments recommendedmodifying the third part of the definition to exclude manufactured itemswhich are formed into a specific shape or design for a particular end-usefunction and which ``consist[ ] of substances which have been thermoset,chemically reacted, or bound by molecular forces, or a combination of theseor similar chemical/physical factors.'' (<T3>See, e.g., </T3> Ex.2-84.) OSHA does not find that this alternative provides sufficient protectionto employees since it does not result in information being provided ifa hazardous chemical is released despite the bonding, etc. described. Theprocess used to produce the material is irrelevant to hazard communication_theonly concern is what employees are being exposed to in the workplace.Another alternative suggested by the formaldehyde industry commenters isthe OSHA exempt <T3>de minimis</T3> releases so that a manufactured item which releases``small'' amounts of a hazardous chemical during normal conditions of useis still considered an article and not covered by the HCS. In particular,the following has been suggested (<T3>e.g., </T3>Ex. 2-84):<ITAG tagnum="21">An amount shall be considered <T3>de minimis</T3> if (a) the concentration of the hazardous chemicalin the article is less than 1% by weight, or 0.1% if the chemical is acarcinogen; or (b) the manufacturer has reason to believe that releaseof the chemical from the article under expected conditions of use willnot exceed an established OSHA PEL or ACGIH TLV.</ITAG>This alternative also does not provide sufficient protection for employees,and does not address the true issue of concern_the exposure of employees.The weight or volume of a gas present in a solid material is totally unrelatedto what is released_in the situation of the formaldehyde-contaminated products(which are the only examples provided in the record to substantiate a ``need''for a <T3>de minimis</T3> exemption in the definition), the gas is 100% of therelease even though the relative weight or volume would be far less thanthe percentages indicated. In fact, OSHA does not consider the exposuresresulting from some of the products of concern to the formaldehyde industry,and which would be exempted if their recommendations are adopted, to be<T3>de minimis</T3> in the sense that they are exposures that result inno hazard to employees and are thus insignificant. Hazard determinationsare to be performed under the rule on those chemicals to which employeesare actually or potentially exposed. In the case of solid items, this meansthat the hazard determination must be done only on the release, not onthose materials still bound in the article. The hazard determination provisions,including the percentage cut-off, would apply to the released materialwhile the bound materials in the solid remain totally exempted. Chromium,for example, is a hazardous chemical, but the fact that it is present inconcentrations of greater than 1% of the weight of a solid metal item,such as a bolt, which does not change in form or release chromium intothe workplace air is irrelevant to the employees' protection, and thereforeneed not be considerd in an evaluation of the hazards.Determination of the point at which a gas in a solid becomes hazardousunder the rule is unlike liquid or gas mixtures where OSHA has used a percentagecut-off (paragraph (d)(5)). Commenters have used the existence of thiscut-off for liquid or gas mixtures to support the claim that a similarapproach should be used for articles. Although the percentages are notideal, it is a reasonable conclusion that in a liquid mixture the amountof material released in generally related to the amount of that materialin the mixture. Differences in vapor pressures will have some effect onthat, but the general rule does apply. Furthermore, OSHA has adopted aprovision that will protect employees in the situations where the percentagecut-off will not be protective enough, and stated that if the employerhas information to indicate that the material will present a health hazardto employees when present in smaller concentrations, or could exceed anestablished exposure limit, it is still covered regardless of the factthat the amount of material present in the mixture is small. It shouldalso be noted that where there is a hazardous chemical present in a liquidmixture which presents no potential for exposure, <T3>i.e., </T3>it is chemically bound in such a way that it will not bereleased, the presence of that chemical does not have to be indicated andit is not considered in the hazard determination process. For example,if silica is present in a liquid mixture which remains a liquid, and thesilica cannot become airborne under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeableemergency, the percentage of it in the mixture is irrelevant and it isnot considered in the hazard evaluation. In other words, there is not potentialfor exposure, therefore it is not subject to the rule.Similarly, a solid item may contain large concentrations of a hazardouschemical, but the chemicals are bound in such a manner that employees willnot be exposed to them when they are being used (<T3>e.g.,</T3> lead nuts and bolts). The percentage of these materialsin the solid is irrelevant to employee exposure and thus not to be consideredin the hazard determination process, just as the silica in the liquid mixturedescribed above is not to be considered. Other manufactured items may containonly small amounts of hazardous chemicals by weight in the product as awhole, yet clearly pose potential hazards to employees because these chemicalsare released into the workplace under normal conditions of use (<T3>e.g.,</T3> the formaldehyde-treated fabric described previously) andemployees are exposed.Furthermore, requiring information disclosure solely in situations wherethe released chemical might exceed an OSHA PEL or ACGIH TLV is not consistentwith the purpose of the rule. ``The purpose of hazard communication isto ensure the disclosure of information about the possible hazards of chemicalsin the workplace before the worker is exposed to them, and thus is at riskof experiencing adverse health effects.'' 49 FR 53296. Providing chemicalhazard information only if established air contaminant limits might beexceeded would clearly conflict with this purpose. Also, exposure limitshave been established for only a limited number of hazardous chemicalsand would not address the vast majority of hazardous chemicals encounteredin the workplace. Moreover, since the HCS defines employee exposure asincluding ingestion, skin contact and absorption, in addition to inhalation,the air contaminant limits might be unrelated to the total exposure experiencedby workers to the chemical released from the product. If a hazardous chemicalis released from an item, employees should be informed.However, the Agency does recognize the practical considerations in applyingthe definition is some situations (<T3>e.g., </T3>whether molecular level releases are covered). In the preambleto the revised final rule, the Agency explicitly reiterated its positionon this issue (52 FR 31865):<ITAG tagnum="21">Releases of very small quantities of chemicals are not consideredto be covered by the rule. So if a few molecules or a trace amount arereleased, the item is still an article and therefore exempted * * *.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In practice, application of the definition in these situations hasnot been a problem. OSHA believes that potential coverage of these verysmall releases have been raised as a theoretical problem, rather than anactual problem of application. Examples of items which may release verysmall quantities of materials, but which the Agency considers to be exempted,have been provided in both the compliance directive for the rule (Ex. 4-24),and the revised final rule discussion on articles (52 FR 31865). Thesewould include such items as pens or pencils; emissions from tires whenin use; vinyl upholstery; emissions from newly varnished furniture; andadhesive tapes. It should be noted that these very small releases are farbelow the types of releases that would be exempted if the percentage cut-off<T3>de minimis</T3> approach is taken. Although these nearly imperceptiblereleases are cited as reasons for having a <T3>de minimis</T3> cut-off, these types of releases have always clearlynot been covered by the rule. The proponents of the specific cut-off for<T3>de minimis</T3> releases are, in fact, attempting to exempt other productswhich are clearly covered by the rule, and are intended to be covered dueto the type of exposure and hazard involved.Comments repeating the arguments regarding the <T3>de minimis</T3> issue were again submitted by the formaldehyde-relatedindustries in the comments submitted in response to the final rule (<T3>see</T3> Exs. 5-1, 5-99, and 5-101), as well as in comments submittedto OMB (Ex. 6). No new arguments were presented. Several other commenterssupported use of the EPA TSCA definition (Exs. 5-72, 5-84, 5-93, and 5-94)or the need for a <T3>de minimis</T3> exemption (Exs. 5-83, 5-89, 5-86, and 5-107), but hadno substantive discussions regarding the current definition or difficultyin applying it. Furthermore, these comments were from representatives ofthe non-manufacturing sector which are not in industries involved in hazardevaluation and thus do not have to apply the definition. The only possibleimpact on them is that they will potentially receive information aboutmore products which they use than they will if the definition is changed.OSHA concludes that, first of all, the definition of ``article'' and applicationof the exemption is an issue in the manufacturing sector where such itemsare produced, not in non-manufacturing. The decisions regarding the applicationof the rule to such items has already had to be made by the manufacturingsector, and information on non-exempted materials is already being providedto other manufacturers, and non-manufacturers in those States which havealready extended the rule. For non-manufacturers, the difference in thedefinition only affects them in terms of what information they receiveabout the items they use in their workplaces. Secondly, the rulemakingrecord does not indicate there is a pervasive problem with the definitionas written, and in fact, as discussed previously, a number of commentersspecifically supported the definition. (If manufacturers in general havea significant problem with the article definition, it would have been expectedto be a major issue at the April 2, 1987 OMB public meeting on the informationcollection requirements of the rule affecting manufacturing (Ex. 4-3).However, the ``need'' for a <T3>de minimis</T3> exception in the article definition was only raisedduring that meeting by The Formaldehyde Institute.) Those commenters whodidn't support the definition were generally objecting to their productsbeing covered, not to the definition <T3>per se</T3>. In fact, it is interesting to note that although the formaldehyde-relatedindustries repeatedly urged that OSHA adopt a <T3>de minimis</T3> exemption for its products, when the Agency took suchaction representatives of the industries filed a petition for an administrativestay of the hazard communication provisions of the formaldehyde rule (Ex.4-68):<ITAG tagnum="21">Petitioners seek to stay a single requirement of the formaldehydestandard: a cancer label is apparently required for formaldehyde gas, mixtures,and solutions composed of greater than 0.1% formaldehyde, and materials``capable of releasing into the air under any normal conditions of useat concentrations reaching or exceeding 0.1 ppm.'' This requirement is,on the one hand, unnecessary for worker protection and, on the other hand,devastating to the business of various industries which manufacture andsell products emitting minimal amounts of formaldehyde.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Thus the request for a <T3>de minimis</T3> exception was apparently not merely to clarify therequirements_the ultimate aim was to exempt specific types of productsfrom coverage that would otherwise be covered under the current rule, aswell as the formaldehyde standard, even though they pose a potential hazardto workers.OSHA further concludes that there is no appropriate, protective, generic<T3>de minimis</T3> exemption that has been suggested for the HCS. Theonly commenters that repeatedly suggested a <T3>de minimis</T3> approach were those involved in formaldehyde industries.The final formaldehyde standard includes a <T3>de minimis</T3> exemption for such products, and thus the Agency hasaddressed the specific concerns in a substance-specific standard basedon the rulemaking record developed for formaldehyde. OSHA believes thatit is more appropriate to deal with the issues involving formaldehyde exposuresin the substance-specific standard.On February 2, 1988, OMB disapproved the information collection requirementsof the formaldehyde standard for any labeling and MSDS requirements that``go beyond those already approved in the Hazard Communication Standard(HCS).'' Ex. 4-101. In OSHA's view, there are no labeling or MSDS requirementsin the formaldehyde standard that go beyond those in the HCS.Chemical manufacturers, importers, and distributors have been requiredto provide labels and material safety data sheets for formaldehyde andformaldehyde-containing products since the HCS became effective on November25, 1985. To be considered in compliance with the HCS, an adequately preparedlabel and MSDS would have had to include all of the information currentlyspecified in the formaldehyde standard under its specific hazard communicationrequirements.The formaldehyde standard is less stringent than the HCS insofar as thereis a specific cut-off of 0.1 ppm to determine whether or not an item wouldbe considered an article under that rule. Fewer formaldehyde-containingproducts would be subject to the hazard communication requirements underthe formaldehyde standard than would be subject to the HCS itself. Thusthe establishment of the specific cut-off was de-regulatory. OSHA willbe resubmitting the labeling and MSDS requirements of the formaldehydestandard to OMB for further review in the near future. Until further notice,OSHA will be enforcing the HCS labeling and MSDS requirements for formaldehydeand formaldehyde-containing products. Chemical manufacturers, importers,and distributors may use the applicable provisions in the formaldehydestandard as additional guidance for determining what constitutes an appropriatehazard warning. Furthermore, OSHA's enforcement policy will use the 0.1ppm cut-off for determining when a health hazard is present, rather thanthe lower threshold (<T3>i.e.,</T3> very small quantities) used under the HCS.The Agency has decided to propose modifications to the article definitionin several respects to accommodate legitimate concerns about the rule'sapplication. First, consistent with EPA's approach, fluids and particleshave been specifically excluded from being considered articles. This isnot a change in interpretation, but has merely been added to clarify coverage.Secondly, the definition specifically exempts releases of very small quantities(<T3>e.g.,</T3> minute or trace amounts) of hazardous chemicals as longas they do not pose a health risk to employees. A reference to the hazarddetermination provisions of paragraph (d) has also been added to help clarifythat a hazard determination, including the mixture percentage cut-offs,is to be done on the released material, not on those materials still boundin solid form.Therefore, if there is evidence that under normal conditions of use a singlechemical, determined to be hazardous under paragraph (d), is released froma manufactured item, the HCS provisions would apply for that released chemicalunless the release was of minute or trace quantities and did not pose ahealth risk to employees. If a mixture of chemicals is released in minuteor trace quantities, it would not be covered unless it posed a health riskto employees. If it is released in more than such quantities, then themixture rule in paragraph (d)(5) would apply.Thus, if a hazardous chemical component of the released chemical mixturecomprises less than 1% (or if a carcinogen, less than 0.1%), and thereis no evidence that this hazardous chemical component could exceed an establishedOSHA permissible exposure limit or American Conference of GovernmentalIndustrial Hygienists' Threshold Limit Value, or could present a physicalhazard or health risk to employees in the concentrations released, theemployer need not comply with the HCS information transmittal requirementsfor this truly minute release of hazardous chemical. The rule requirescompliance with the HCS when workers are exposed to hazardous chemicalsknown to be released from manufactured items under normal conditions ofuse, but clarifies by reference to paragraph (d) that the percentage cut-offsin the current rule's mixture provisions exempt employers from the HCSwhere there are very small quantities of hazardous chemicals released fromthese items and which do not pose a health risk to employees.Other alternatives have been considered by OSHA but rejected for variousreasons. For example, establishing a percentage of the permissible exposurelimit (PEL) as a cut-off has been discussed. The problems foreseen forthis approach include, foremost, the lack of PELs for many substances,and additionally, the difficulty in accurately predicting specific exposuresdownstream (<T3>i.e.,</T3> a percentage of the PEL being exceeded), and the difficultyin standardizing methods of measuring such releases (an issue that hasalso been raised in the petition for administrative stay of the formaldehyderule, Ex. 4-68). Although OSHA has set specific coverage cut-offs in anumber of particular standards requiring chemical manufacturers to estimatedownstream exposures, these cut-offs were based on administrative recordsdeveloped specifically for these regulated chemicals. OSHA believes itis inappropriate to set a single exposure cut-off for the hundreds of thousandsof chemical products covered by the HCS.Determining coverage by the level of detectability for each released materialhas also been suggested. Since the limits of detectability vary by chemical,this does not appear to be a viable approach. Furthermore, sometimes themethod of detection for a chemical is so refined that this would resultin more items being considered to be covered under the rule than underthe current approach. OSHA invites comment on these suggestions and theproposed modifications to the definition and exemption, as well as solicitingother approaches for dealing with or clarifying the issue.<T3>OMB Determination on Articles.</T3> According to the letter preparedby OMB regarding the information collection requirements of the rule (Ex.4-67), the record examined by OMB in making its determination ``supportsthe need for an article exemption'' but ``does not support the existingdefinition of `article,' particularly with regard to the lack of a <T3>de minimis</T3> exemption and the agency's interpretation of `normalconditions of use'.'' OMB further concludes that ``the evidence is convincingthat the current definition of `article' would indeed result in the inclusionof many items that present trivial risks, and that OSHA's preamble discussionof the issue is insufficient to exclude those items.'' An approach thatOMB would consider to be more consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act``would exclude <T3>de minimis</T3> exposures expressly, and define such exposures in thesame terms used in the exclusion for trace components of mixtures.''OMB also believes that ``the record suggests that the detailed substance-specificinformation provided on the MSDS can be useful in a controlled work environment,such as a manufacturing facility, in which the employer knows what hazardsare present and where. Detailed substance-specific information does not,however, seem to offer much practical benefit in uncontrolled environments,such as that faced on a construction site or by a repairman, where theemployer knows generally but not specifically what hazards the employeewill face, or when, or where. In uncontrolled situations, generic hazardtraining seems much more relevant to protecting workers from the arrayof hazards they may face and the materials handling decisions that theymust make throughout the workday.''OMB uses this argument to object to OSHA's determination that the exemptionfor an article is based upon its ultimate use, and it is not exempted ifit releases material while workers are using it in the course of theiremployment in operations such as installation. ``Outside the manufacturingsector, there is likely to be little practical utility to a requirementthat MSDSs and labels accompany solid objects that would be `articles'under normal conditions of use.''OMB therefore required OSHA ``to consider, at least, alternatives to thedefinition of `article,' including a <T3>de minimis</T3> exemption and clarification of the concept of `normalconditions of use,'' and shall conform the requirements on the manufacturingsector with the requirements on the non-manufacturing sector in light ofthis decision.''OSHA has reconsidered the definition, as described above, and is proposinga modification consistent with existing interpretations of the rule andadequate protection of workers. Comment on the OMB determination is invitedas well as comments on the discussion above and the proposed modifications.<T3>Food, drugs, cosmetics, and alcoholic beverages.</T3> In the revisedfinal rule, OSHA included an exemption for food, drugs, cosmetics, or alcoholicbeverages in a retail establishment which are packaged for sale to consumers(paragraph (b)(6)(v)). This exemption recognized that even where thesechemicals are hazardous chemicals (and many are not, particularly in thearea of food items), they present little or no hazard to employees whenthey are in final packaged form for sale to consumers. This exemption effectivelylimited coverage of many retail establishments which only have hazardouschemicals in this form, <T3>i.e.,</T3> packaged for sale to consumers. But it did not exempt theseproducts when they are being used in a retail establishment and thus exposingemployees_such as beauty products being used in a salon.OSHA has received comments and questions about the application of thisexemption from both businesses distributing to retail food establishments(<T3>see,</T3> Ex. 5-97) and the retail establishments themselves (<T3>see,</T3> Ex. 5-5). As stated in the preamble to the revised finalrule, if a product is exempted downstream, a distributor has no responsibilityfor providing a MSDS on that product to the retail distributor. ``In addition,since these products are exempted, employers which package them for retailsale would not have to furnish material safety data sheets to distributorsreceiving the products.'' 52 FR 31862.OSHA is proposing a further modification to this exemption which both clarifiesand extends it to other food and alcoholic beverage products in retailestablishments which are being prepared for consumption by consumers. Thusfood which is used for cooking meals to be sold to customers would be exempt,as would alcoholic beverages which are sold by the glass and thus preparedfor consumption rather than ``packaged'' for consumer use. Although OSHAbelieves that most such products in terms of food items would not be hazardousunder the rule in any event, it appears that some manufacturers are neverthelessproviding material safety data sheets for such items as aflatoxin in peanutbutter used in a restaurant. To ensure such interpretations are not made,and that material safety data sheets are not unnecessarily being providedfor such items, OSHA is proposing this modification to the exemption andinviting comment on the proposed language.<T3>Consumer products. </T3>One of the principles upon which the HCS isbuilt is that employees are entitled to information regarding any chemicalwhich is hazardous and to which they are potentially exposed. The typeof use this product is intended for is irrelevant_the risk being addressedis exposure to a chemical without knowing what the hazards and appropriateprotective measures are. That being the case, the 1982 NPRM contained noexemptions for any ``types'' of chemicals. The exemptions which were inthe original final rule were based upon comments submitted to the rulemakingrecord after that proposal. OSHA limited the exemptions to situations whereother regulatory programs adequately addressed the problems involved (<T3>e.g., </T3>labeling exemptions for those products labeled in accordancewith another Federal agency's requirements), or where the hazards did notresult from workplace exposure.In the area of consumer products, the original final rule included an exemptionfor additional labels on such products when they are labeled in accordancewith the requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).CPSC's requirements for labeling of hazardous substances are for the purposeof protecting consumers when such products are used in the home, the school,and recreational facilities (15 U.S.C. 2052(a)(1)). The Federal HazardousSubstances Act, 15 U.S.C. 1261 <T3>et seq., </T3>and regulations issued under that Act by CPSC are notdesigned to protect workers. <T3>See American Petroleum Institute v. OSHA, </T3>581 F.2d 493, 510 (5thCir. 1978), <T3>aff'd on other grounds sub. nom. Industrial Union Dep't. v. AmericanPetroleum Institute, </T3>448 U.S. 607 (1980).Consumer products generally do not include the type of specific hazardinformation OSHA would require on the labels of containers of hazardouschemicals which are shipped. Although some consideration is given to chronichazards, the basic emphasis is on acute effects. In addition, the labelsfocus on precautionary statements and routes of exposure rather than informingthe user of the specific hazards. For example, a label for lead solderpurchased in a hardware store indicates that it is ``fatal if swallowed''and ``causes severe burns,'' but gives no indication of the fact that leadcauses not only acute lead poisoning but also has severe effects on a numberof body systems, including damage to blood-forming, nervous, and reproductivesystems (<T3>see, </T3>OSHA's lead standard, 29 CFR 1910.1025). Furthermore, theprimary route of entry for occupational exposure to lead would normallybe inhalation_the consumer label does not indicate that inhalation of fumesgenerated when soldering are of concern. (Ex. 4-71). Conversely, a properlyprepared MSDS for the same material will indicate the full range of healtheffects, the appropriate protective measures, the fact that there is anOSHA standard for the material with a permissible exposure limit, and otheruseful information for both the employer and the employee being exposed.OSHA nevertheless decided to permit the CPSC labels to suffice so as notto disrupt the extensive labeling conducted in accordance with those rules.OSHA believed that this could be justified on the basis that some informationis provided on the labels that would be useful to workers, and that therequirement for MSDSs would provide what information is necessary to supplementthe labels. 48 FR 53289. This additional information is critical to ensuringthat training can be properly conducted, and that adequate protective measuresare used in the workplace.OSHA is not preempted from modifying the labeling requirements for thoseproducts covered by CPSC that may also be found in the workplace. 15 U.S.C.2080. Where products are used in both industry and the home ``there maybe dual, or overlapping jurisdiction between the Secretary of Labor underOSHA and the Commission under the Consumer Product Safety Act.'' W. Kimble,<T3>Federal Consumer Product Safety Act, </T3>337 (1975). ``Different standardsmay * * * be applied to eliminate or reduce a hazard to the consumer thanare applied to eliminate or reduce the same hazard as it confronts the* * * workman * * * <T3>Id. </T3>As the Fifth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals found whenconsidering labeling requirements for benzene, ``[A]lthough an existingrequirement for labeling under another act may affect the reasonable necessityfor an OSHA requirement'' section 4(b)(1) of the OSHA Act does not prohibitOSHA from requiring containers of hazardous chemicals to bear the warninglabels authorized by section 6(b)(7) when the CPSC requires labels on thesame products. <T3>API v. OSHA, </T3>581 F.2d at 510. Therefore, OSHA is free to imposerequirements determined to be necessary to protect employees from the hazardsof products that may also be considered consumer products regulated underthe requirements of the CPSC.Upon considering what information is necessary for the protection of workersexosed to those so-called consumer products in the workplace, OSHA decidedthat protection of workers would be served by allowing the CPSC labelsto suffice, but requiring MSDSs and training as for any other hazardouschemicals. There appears to be some misconception that by virtue of beingpermitted to be marketed to consumers, consumer products are inherentlysafe and don't require any additional information be given to workers usingthem. This certainly is not the case.The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), in its National ElectronicInjury Surveillance System (NEISS), compiles estimates of product-associatedinjuries based on a statistically significant sample of incidents reportedto institutions with emergency treatment department. Information regardingwork-related injuries treated in emergency rooms has subsequently beenprovided by CPSC to the National Institute for Occupational Safety andHealth (NIOSH). <T3>See </T3>Ex. 4-77.These work-related data are total numbers of chemical injuries, and arenot collected in such a way that the consumer product injuries in the workplacecan be separated from other chemical product injuries. The CPSC versionof the data is reported by type of product, while the NIOSH work-relateddata is grouped by source of injury. Nevertheless, much information regardingreported injuries can be derived from the data as presented, and give someindication of the numbers of serious injuries related to the use of chemicals.Since these data only deal with injuries which require emergency room treatment,it can be assumed that they are a small subset of the total number of injurieswhich occur.According to the CPSC, the national estimate for emergency room treatmentsof injuries related to paints, varnishes, and shellacs is 10,712, and 75%of these injuries occur in adults from ages 15 through 64, an age rangewhich would encompass adults who work. At least 5% of these injuries resultin hospitalization. National estimates for other types of chemical productswhich would also be found in the workplace include: 7530 injuries relatedto adhesives (51% of them in the adult working age categories); 3186 injuriesrelated to lubricants (71% in the adult working age categories); 2977 relatedto drain cleaners (63% working age adults); 1882 related to automotivechemicals (69% working age adults); and 5584 related to laundry soaps ordetergents (52% working age adults). There are many other products forwhich injuries are reported and which would be expected to be found inthe workplace. These numbers indicate that adults of working age are beinginjured through the use of consumer products, whether in the home or inthe workplace. In workplaces where these products are being used more frequentlyor for longer periods of time, the risk of injury increases. Appropriatecommunication of hazards and protective measures decreases that risk ofinjury.The NIOSH data indicate that a total of 136,212 work-related chemical injurieswere estimated to have been treated in emergency rooms in 1986. The sourcesof injuries included in this total were chemicals and chemical compounds(solids, liquids, gases): 102,428; coal and petroleum products: 23,532;and soaps, detergents, cleaning compounds not classified elsewhere: 10,252.There were other categories of sources of injuries that had chemical productexposures in them, but these three were expected to be the ones of costsignificance. As mentioned above, it is not possible to determine whichof these work-related injuries result solely from consumer products. However,in categories such as soaps, detergents, and cleaning compounds, it canreasonably be assumed that a number of them were consumer products.Many products used industrially are also sold and used as consumer products.Thus, exempting such products is in essence exempting them because of themethod of distribution for them, <T3>i.e., </T3>that they are generally sold in retail establishments, ratherthan through wholesale distribution systems. This is not an appropriaterationale for such an exemption since it does not consider either exposureor hazardous nature. Of particular concern is that the CPSC label is designedto protect consumers under normal conditions of consumer use, or reasonablyforeseen misuse, and is frequently directed towards protection of childrenunintentionally exposed in the home, rather than being directed towardsprotection of workers exposed repeatedly, and to potentially larger concentrationsof the material. In fact, a number of consumer product labels recognizethis difference in exposure and note on the label either that the productis not intended to be used in the workplace (Ex. 4-64), or that a materialsafety data sheet should be acquired if it is used in the workplace (Ex.4-71).It is also important to note that the record overwhelmingly supports theneed for a comprehensive hazard communication program, comprised of labels,material safety data sheets, and training. In 1981, OSHA published andlater withdrew a NPRM which was a labeling standard_it had no provisionsfor development of material safety data sheets or for training. One ofthe primary reasons for the withdrawal was the lack of support for a rulewhich relied only on label information. In fact, only one commenter onthe 1982 NPRM believed that the MSDS should not be the primary source ofinformation on the chemical (H-022 Ex. 19-49), whereas numerous respondentsendorsed the MSDS provisions and role in hazard communication as beingimportant and necessary (<T3>se, e.g., </T3>H-022 Exs. 19-11, 19-62, 19-75, 19-91, 19-119, 19-156,19-177, and 19-207). For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Association(Ex. 19-91) stated that: ``[T]he proposed standard appropriately makesthe MSDS, rather than the actual container in the workplace, the sourcefrom which employees and their representatives may obtain detailed informationregarding potentially hazardous substances used in the workplace.'' Similarly,the American Petroleum Institute (Ex. 19-111) stated that ``labels maynot always be the most effective means for communicating the potentialhazards of a work area * * *'' and that ``MSDSs constitute a vital meansof communicating safety and health hazards presented by particular chemicalsand mixtures to <T3>employer/users</T3> * * *.'' And American Cyanamid Company also agreedthat ``the use of the MSDS as the primary source of data for propertiesof commercial chemicals is a worthy part of the proposed regulation * **.'' (Ex. 19-119.)OSHA thus did not exempt consumer products from any provisions of the originalfinal rule other than labeling. This was an explicit recognition by theAgency of the greater potential for exposure in the workplace, and thelack of complete information on consumer product labels to address suchsituations (48 FR 53289):<ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA recognizes, however, that there may be situations where workerexposure is significantly greater than that of consumers, and that underthese circumstances substances which are safe for contemplated consumeruse may pose unique hazards in the workplace. For this reason, the standard'sexclusion is limited to labeling. It does not exempt employers from thematerial safety data sheet and training requirements of the standard withrespect to any of these substances, provided of course that the substanceotherwise meets the standard's definition of hazardous chemical. Moreover,it should be stressed that these labeling exclusions are for the enumeratedsubstances only. To the extent that any employer uses other chemicals,such as in the manufacture or processing of these substances, they arefully subject to the requirements of this standard.</ITAG>During the implementation of the original final rule, OSHA determined thatits enforcement policy regarding consumer products would focus on the typeand extent of usage (<T3>see, </T3>OSHA's instructions to compliance officers for enforcementof the HCS, Ex. 4-24):<ITAG tagnum="21">A common sense approach must be employed whenever a product is usedin a manner similar to which it could be used by a consumer, thus resultingin levels of exposure comparable to consumer exposure. The frequency andduration of use should be considered. For example, it may not be necessaryto have a data sheet for a can of cleanser used to clean the sink in anemployee restroom. However, if such cleanser is used in large quantitiesto clean process equipment, it should be addressed in the Hazard CommunicationProgram.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This appeared to OSHA to be a reasonable accommodation for employerswho really do use consumer products in the manner intended, and with thesame frequency and duration of exposure as would be experienced as consumers.OSHA has had no problems in implementing this enforcement policy, and ithas been our experience that covered employers understand it and are ableto comply. Therefore, although it is a policy which decreases the amountof information available to some employees covered under the rule, OSHAfelt it could be justified based on the fact that under the same circumstancesin the home the same type of information would be available to that individualfor protection. Many employers have told OSHA that consumer products areincluded in their hazard communication programs regardless of the enforcementpolicy of the Agency because they believe that all hazardous chemicalsshould be included in an appropriate hazardous materials management program.OSHA recognized that many more non-manufacturers would use consumer productsthan would be found in manufacturing facilities, and that the method ofobtaining them might more likely be from retail distributors than wholesale.Thus the ANPR included questions regarding the use of such products, andthe means of obtaining them. Relatively few responses were received. However,the responses did confirm that in many cases the use of consumer productsresults in significant exposures that warrant more information being availablethan that which appears on a consumer product label. For example, DanielConstruction Company responded to the questions as follows (Ex. 2-59):<ITAG tagnum="21">The most common ``consumer products'' used in the construction industryare wood and wood products, caulking, and aerosol cans of spray paints,cleaners, lubricants, and solvents. These products are not typically useddifferently than consumers do. That does not mean that employees cannotbe overexposed to the ingredients. For example, a 16-ounce spray can ofpaint used in a 10andmin172;x10andmin172;x10andmin172; room can produce a concentrationof solvent that is more than ten times the acceptable exposure limit.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Of course a consumer product label would not normally indicate thatthere is a permissible exposure limit for a solvent present in the paintsince this information is unrelated to consumer use and exposure. However,a MSDS for the product would be required to include such information whichwill enable the employer to ensure that employees are properly protectedin a situation as that described by Daniel Construction Company. In fact,the CPSC has recommended the use of MSDSs for products they cover in schoollaboratories (Ex. 4-56), recognizing that additional information is desirablein these types of exposure situations. ``Material safety data sheets shouldbe obtained on each chemical delineating particular hazards or handlingprocedures.'' ``Have a material safety data sheet on hand before usinga chemical.''Similarly, the American Gas Association (Ex. 2-83) indicated that use ofconsumer products could result in different exposure levels than thoseencountered during consumer use:<ITAG tagnum="21">It could occur_not because of different use, but because the use byemployees is for prolonged periods of time. An average consumer may usea cleanser several times a week to clean the kitchen or bathroom floor,whereas a gas company employee may use the same cleanser every day to cleana gas facility.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (Ex. 2-120) also indicatedthat their employees are exposed to consumer products in greater amountsthan consumers would be, including paint and thinners used by the painters,printing fluids used by the graphic arts services, cleaning and polishingchemicals used by the custodians, lawn and garden chemicals used by thegrounds maintenance crew, and lubricating sprays and other maintenanceproducts used by mechanics/electricians. MIT obtains MSDSs from vendorsto ensure employees are properly protected from these materials. MountainBell (Ex. 2-164) also confirms that consumer product exposures may be greaterin its industry, particularly ``* * * where products are used on an extensivebasis such as in automotive operations, janitorial operations, and copyingoperations * * *.''A few respondents felt that the consumer product label should be enoughinformation (Exs. 2-75, 2-79, 2-99, 2-107, and 2-116). Others, however,noted that employees are not getting enough information regarding theseproducts and that MSDSs should be made available. For example, EconomicsLaboratory, Inc., a manufacturer of consumer products for cleaning andsanitizing, suggested (Ex. 2-67):<ITAG tagnum="21">In the use of cleaning and sanitizing products, a principal pointof worker exposure is during the transfer of concentrate from the originalcontainer to prepare a use solution. We supply products labeled as perANSI and/or FHSA, but we have seen instances of deficient labeling on theproducts of some other manufacturers. We now send to all customers in thesesectors an MSDS for every product they purchase. Many of our customersnow use the labels, MSDS and other aids to train employees, but a formalrequirement would increase that number throughout the industry.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Adhesive and Sealant Council, a trade association which representsmanufacturers of materials that may be marketed as consumer products, alsoaddressed this issue (Ex. 2-109): <ITAG tagnum="21">*** The Council is concerned that in certain cases hazard informationmay not reach employees of manufacturers and non-manufacturers. ASC membersare aware of cases in which consumer products are purchased from retailersor distributors in consumer quantities but are used in the workplace. Undersuch circumstances the original manufacturer is not made aware of the useof its consumer products in the workplace. Thus, some workers may lackneeded hazard information unless they or their employer affirmatively andvoluntarily make an effort to obtain and promulgate the information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are, of course, safety requirements applicable to consumer productsunder the Consumer Product Safety Act, and other federal laws, but thesedo not contain broad workplace safety requirements beyond standards andlabeling, such as material safety data sheets. The present OSHA dockethas not been opened as to this issue. However, ASC believes the problemcould be greater with regard to non-manufacturer distribution than withdirect manufacturer distribution *** </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">One further comment submitted by an employee representative summedup the situation by stating that when a product is used by a professionalin the workplace, it is no longer a ``consumer'' product regardless ofthe fact that a consumer can purchase the same product (Ex. 2-199). OSHA decided to incorporate into the revised final rule its existing enforcementpolicy which is tied to type and extent of exposure (52 FR 31878; paragraph(b)(6)(vii)): <ITAG tagnum="21">Any consumer product or hazardous substance, as those terms are definedin the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051 <T3>et seq.</T3>) respectively, where the employer can demonstrate it isused in the workplace in the same manner as normal consumer use, and whichuse results in a duration and frequency of exposure which is not greaterthan exposures experienced by consumers ***. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA further stated that this exemption ``strikes a balance betweenthe practical considerations of acquiring and maintaining material safetydata sheets on CPSC regulated products which employees are exposed to athome as well as at work, and the worker's need for more hazard informationthan a CPSC label when exposures are greater or more frequent than typicalpublic use of the chemical would generate.'' 52 FR 31863. OSHA had alsoexamined the existing State rules in the area of right-to-know, and foundthat many had consumer product exemptions that were related to the typeand extent of usage. (<T3>See, e.g., </T3>Illinois, 48 Ill. Rev. Stat. s1401 (consumer goodsexempted ``provided that employee exposure to such consumer goods is notsignificantly greater than consumer exposure occurring during the principalconsumer uses of the consumer goods''); Maine, 26 M.R.S.A. s1709-1725 asamended (exempts consumer products and foodstuffs ``to which, in the employer'sknowledge, employee exposure is not significantly different from that ofthe general public during foreseeable use of the substance''); Massachusetts,Chapter 111F of Massachusetts General Laws (exempts consumer goods whichare not carcinogens, mutagens, teratogens, neurotoxins, or ``extraordinarilyhazardous'' substances and which are ``used in the workplace in such amanner that employee exposure is equivalent to exposures resulting fromconsumer usage''). Other State rules are consistent with the original FederalHCS and have no exemptions for consumer products (<T3>see, e.g., </T3>Arizona, Kentucky, South Carolina). There were some comments submitted on the coverage of consumer productsfollowing the publication of the revised final rule. A number of them feltthat they could not define what exposures in the workplace would be comparableto consumer exposure, and that the rule should exempt such exposures unlessthey are ``significantly'' greater than consumer exposure or that suchproducts should be completely exempted (Exs. 5-53, 5-72, 5-88, 5-93, 5-94,and 5-97). As we have stated earlier, a common sense approach is requiredin making these determinations, and most employers we have dealt with clearlyknow whether the use of such products is unusual or frequent. However,we are inviting further comment on the issue of adding the word ``significantly''to the consumer product exemption to modify ``greater.'' Another suggestion submitted (Exs. 5-84, 5-93) was to use the same consumerproduct exemption used by Congress in the community right-to-know provisionsof the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986, Pub.L. 99-499 (Ex. 4-16), which is being implemented by the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA). The exemption would then be for ``any substance to the extentthat it is used for personal, family, or household purposes, or is presentin the same form and concentration as a product packaged for distributionand use by the general public.'' As this exemption is also not relatedto the extent of employee exposure_which is the concern of OSHA in theHCS_it is not appropriate for this rule. The legislative history for SARA does not discuss the household or consumerproduct exemption. OSHA's rule preceded the SARA legislation, and it canbe argued that the exemptions in SARA were intended by Congress to addressthe different needs of community right-to-know versus worker right-to-know.Community right-to-know under SARA entails informing the general publicand emergency response facilities about chemicals in their neighborhoodsthat could cause hazardous conditions during emergency situations. TheHCS involves informing employees about the chemicals they are potentiallyexposed to on a day-to-day basis as a result of their work. Exemption ofconsumer products under SARA was not a determination by Congress that suchcoverage is unnecessary in the workplace. The National Paint and Coatings Association (NPCA) suggested that it istoo costly to provide MSDSs to paint contractors and retail establishmentsand that they therefore should not be required for consumer product paints(Ex. 2-75). Alternatively, NPCA suggested containers of one gallon or lessshould be exempted. As has already been described, OSHA believes that theonly appropriate criteria for determining whether a chemical is coveredis the existence of a hazard and the potential for exposure. Both of thesecriteria are met for many paint products. As was described above, use ofeven a 16 ounce spray can of paint can result in employee exposures often times the permissible exposure limit, so the size of the containeris not the determining factor. The NPCA indicated that it would be difficult to comply due to the largenumbers of products involved and the multiplicity of distributors. However,there are already a number of States which require MSDSs for such products,and it is our understanding that many employers in construction have beenable to obtain MSDSs for consumer product paints from their vendors. Furthermore,there is evidence in the record that paint producers customarily distributedocuments referred to as ``technical data sheets'' which prescribe methodsof application and other use-related information, including, in some situations,brief indications of hazards (Ex. 4-60). These technical data sheets areapparently supplied to distributors to provide information regarding theproducts that does not appear on the product labels. It appears to OSHAthat if these sheets can efficiently be distributed for paint products,then MSDSs can as well. Alternatively, the information required on a MSDScould merely be added to the technical data sheets. It certainly cannotbe argued that labels alone provide the same type of information that aMSDS would. An issue that is related to the coverage of consumer products, and is undoubtedlythe genesis of some of the recommendations to eliminate such products fromcoverage, is the distribution of consumer products in commerce. It is importantto point out that the vast majority of consumer products are not coveredby this rule. Only those which are hazardous are potentially covered, andwithin that group, only those which are used in the workplace. Producersof the materials which, while marketed to consumers, are likely to be soldto employers and used in the workplace are well aware of that potentialmarket. (<T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g.,</T3> Ex. 2-148.) Thus manufacturers of materials used in construction,graphic arts, and clearning operations, are aware that their products haveindustrial applications even when sold as consumer products. MSDSs havealready been prepared and distributed for many, if not most, of these products.Manufacturers are required to have MSDSs for their own workers, and havealready been required to distribute such MSDSs to non-manufacturing customersin a significant number of states with right-to-know rules. Furthermore,most manufacturers have and make available MSDSs because of product liabilityconcerns separate and apart from any regulatory requirements. This wascertainly demonstrated in the record by the large number of manufacturersthat produced MSDSs in the absence of such requirements prior to promulgationof the original HCS. The sealed container provision also eliminates manyconsumer products from coverage in workplaces which may handle such materials,but do not open the containers to use them.  The record for the original final rule strongly supported the need forautomatic transmittal of MSDSs from producers to users through the supplychain. The cost analyses of the rule demonstrated that a system that relieson users requesting a copy of a MSDS will be more costly, and less protective(48 FR 53327). However, in the revised final rule, OSHA determined thatwhere retail distributors are involved in the distribution chain it wasnecessary to slightly revise this position. Therefore, the revised finalrule stated (52 FR 31882, paragraph (g)(7)):<ITAG tagnum="21">Retail distributors which sell hazardous chemicals to commercial customersshall provide a material safety data sheet upon request, and shall posta sign or otherwise inform them that a material safety data sheet is available.Chemical manufacturers, importers, and distributors need not provide materialsafety data sheets to retail distributors which have informed them thatthe retail distributor does not sell the product to commercial customersor open the sealed container to use it in their own workplaces.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA provided the following rationale for this departure from theautomatic provision approach found to be necessary in the original finalrule (52 FR 31866):<ITAG tagnum="21">Retail distributors, however, often sell to businesses and the generalpublic and frequently have no way of knowing who a particular purchaseris. Under the current rule, retail distributors might have to give materialsafety data sheets to each customer to ensure that commercial customersget the information they need under the HCS. A specific statement regardingretail distributors is, therefore, included in paragraph (g)(7) to addressthis practical problem. Those retail distributors who sell hazardous chemicalsto employers must provide a material safety data sheet upon request, andmust post a sign or otherwise inform the employers that an MSDS is available.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA recognizes that although it is possible for an employer to incidentallypurchase a hazardous chemical from any type of retail establishment, itis not reasonable to expect every retail store that happens to carry suchmaterials to keep a file of MSDSs in case an employer decides to make arandom purchase at the store. We further recognize that such random purchaseswould normally be of small amounts that would generally be used as a consumeruses them, and thus would be exempt under the rule anyway. However, evenin those cases where they are used in greater quantities, it appears morereasonable to place the burden on the user in that situation to obtainthe MSDS than to have every retail establishment keep large numbers ofthem on file. This provision also limits the number of establishments towhich distributors of such products have to transmit MSDSs.  The National Retail Merchants Association (NRMA) (Ex. 5-74) indicated thatthe final rule ``* * * has struck a good balance between the obvious problemof requiring retailers to train all employees about every product whichmay appear on retailers' shelves, and the real need for employee trainingfor emergency spillage of packaged products.'' They did think, however,that the definition of ``consumer product'' as stated by CPSC might beconfusing to retailers, particularly small businesses, since ``retailerswould have to go through the process of examining all goods sold in theirstores to determine if they are or are not consumer products.'' In fact,if retailers are selling the products they are considered to be ``consumer''products_there is no determination to be made by the retailer in this respect,it's a determination made by the producer in developing the appropriatelabel for the material based upon its intended use.  With regard to the issue of making MSDSs available at the retail distributionlevel, NRMA suggested that OSHA define the term ``commercial account''to ensure it is being properly interpreted and applied. They further suggestedthat this definition be related to selling items in large quantities andbelow the regular retail price. ``Such accounts can be identified, andit would be less burdensome to notify such customers that MSDSs are availableupon request. In fact, many retail firms have already done this under manystate right-to-know laws.'' (Ex. 5-74).  The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (UBCJA) similarlynoted that with regard to MSDSs being available from retail distibutors(Ex. 2-105):<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * [T]hose contractors who do purchase materials from retail outletsgenerally buy them from a building-supply house that sells such materialsin larger quantities, and may give them a volume discount. These storeswould have no problem supplying MSDSs to customers * * * </ITAG>OSHA agrees with the NRMA that adding such a definition will clarify thatmany retail distributors have no need to maintain MSDSs because they donot generally supply hazardous chemicals to commercial customers (<T3>e.g.</T3>, grocery stores, clothing stores). Therefore, we are proposinga definition for the term ``commercial account'' based upon NRMA's recommendedcriteria, and are inviting comment on the appropriateness of this approach.In addition, we are proposing to further modify the language in paragraph(g)(7) to indicate that when an employer purchases a consumer product froma retail establishment which does not have commercial accounts, and thatemployer needs to obtain a material safety data sheet, the retail distributor'sduty is limited to providing, upon request, the name, address, and telephonenumber of the chemical manufacturer, importer, or distributor from whicha MSDS can be obtained. We believe these modifications should clarify theduties of distributors of consumer products through retail distribution.In summary, OSHA is not proposing to modify the consumer product exemption<T3>per se, </T3>although it is inviting comment on certain issues. TheAgency continues to maintain that the mode of distribution of a product(<T3>i.e., </T3>through retail distribution rather than wholesale) is nota criterion that is related to employee exposure or the need for informationand therefore is not relevant to whether consumer products should be coveredby this rule. The modifications proposed to the provisions regarding retaildistribution should clarify them to ensure the regulated community is awarewhat needs to be done to comply with the revised final rule. OSHA invitescomments on these issues as well.   <T3>OMB Determination. </T3>OMB has disapproved the information collectionrequirements for any consumer products that are exempted from the EPA requirementsfor community right-to-know (Ex. 4-67). OMB maintains that such an exemptionwould make the OSHA and EPA right-to-know requirements, which are closelylinked, mutually consistent. Using the same exemption in both rules avoidsthe situation in which employers must separate the paperwork for their``consumer products'' into two groups: An OSHA ``consumer product'' andan EPA ``consumer product.'' Furthermore, OMB believes this exemption ``establishesobjective criteria that enable upstream and downstream employers to determinewhat is exempted and what is included. Upstream suppliers would not beforced to speculate as to the identity of the final user (consumer or employer?)in determining whether the product is subject to the HCS. The flow of MSDSsand labels would be restricted to unpackaged substances or substances packagedfor industrial or commercial use, for which detailed hazard informationwould be expected to have practical utility.'' OSHA invites comments onthese conclusions as well.   <T3>Drugs. </T3>The original HCS covered the manufacture and formulationof drugs in the manufacturing sector. The rule included a labeling exemptionfor such products when they were labeled in accordance with the regulationsof the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but all other aspects of theprogram were applicable to the drug products as well as those chemicalsused to make them. In preparing the revised final rule, OSHA determinedthat it is not necessary to cover such drugs in the non-manufacturing sectorwhen they are in a form that is not likely to result in exposure to employees.Thus the rule totally exempted drugs when they are in a retail establishment(<T3>i.e., </T3>a drug store of a pharmacy) and packaged for sale to a consumer(paragraph (b)(60(v)). Therefore all over-the-counter drugs were exemptedfrom the point of packaging, and many prescription drugs were exemptedas well since they are packaged prior to reaching the retail establishment.In addition, OSHA included an exemption for drugs in solid, final formfor administration to a patient. As mentioned previously, this was basedon the Agency's determination that the potential for exposure is minimalfor these drugs.   However, in recognition of the fact that there are various types of workerswho may be exposed to drugs in hospitals or pharmacies (<T3>e.g., </T3>nurses, nurses' aides, pharmacy aides, or technicians),OSHA did not exempt those drugs that are not solid or are not pre-packagedfor sale to consumers (a pharmacy in a hospital would be considered tobe a retail sale establishment for purposes of the exemption as written).Thus nurses required to mix anti-neoplastic drugs, for example, would beentitled to a material safety data sheet and training under the revisedfinal rule. There was little discussion of the drug issue in the recordprior to the revised final rule (<T3>see, e.g., </T3>Ex. 2-176). However, since drugs are designed to bebiologically active, OSHA wants to ensure that employees will be properlyprotected. As an example of potential problems, a recent report in theAmerican Industrial Hygiene Association (Ex. 4-59) described one hospital'sexperience with a drug that is generated as an aerosol in a tent for administrationto children. Nurses, respiratory therapists, doctors, and other employeesare directly exposed when they enter the tent to care for the patients.Information on the drug indicates that such occupational exposure may resultin carcinogenesis, fertility impairment, and fetotoxicity. In addition,however, employees who were exposed also complained of experiencing acuteeffects such as headaches, burning and dryness of the eyes, coughing anddryness of the upper respiratory tract. The hospital eventually deviseda protective program for exposed employees based upon its experiences.A MSDS with recommendations for protective measures may have helped themresolve the situation prior to employees being exposed.   In response to the approach taken in the revised final rule, the NationalWholesale Druggists' Association (NWDA) (Ex. 5-85) recommended that OSHArecognize package inserts approved under FDA regulations as an acceptablealternative to material safety data sheets required under the rule. Additionally,the NWDA suggested that the <T3>Physicians' Desk Reference, </T3>a privately developed reference regardingdrugs, also be considered to be an alternative to requiring MSDSs for drugsapproved by FDA. Other commenters recommended that all prescription drugsbe exempted since they are adequately covered by FDA labels, other availableresources, and the medical training of persons handling or supervisinghandling of the drugs (Exs. 5-77 and 5-102).   Although the purpose of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act administeredby the FDA is to protect consumers of such products and the general public(<T3>see, e.g</T3>., <T3>Pharmaceutical Mfrs v. FDA, </T3>484 F. Supp. 1179, 1183 (D.Del 1980)),the product data inserts that accompany pharmaceuticals do contain someinformation that is analogous to that found on MSDSs and would providesome protection for employees. In particular, at 21 CFR 201.100(d)(1)(asparaphrased below), FDA requires that inserts for prescription drugs forhuman use must contain the following information: Adequate informationfor such use, including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods,and frequency and duration of administration and any <T3>relevant warnings, hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions,under which practitioners, side effects, and precautions, </T3>under whichpractitioners licensed by law to administer the drug can use the drug safelyand for the purposes for which it is intended * * * [in] the same [ ] languageand emphasis as labeling approved or permitted * * *. (Italics added).This would be useful chemical hazard information for employees involvedin administering the products even though employee protection is not theprimary purpose of the information presented.In addition to publication of such information in the package inserts themselves,the FDA regulations also state that (21 CFR 202.1(1)(2), as paraphrasedbelow): [R]eferences published (<T3>for example,</T3> the ``<T3>Physicians' Desk Reference</T3>'') for use by medical practitioners,pharmacists, or nurses, containing drug information supplied by the manufacturer,packer, or distributor of the drug and which are disseminated by or onbehalf of its manufacturer, packer, or distributor <T3>are hereby determined to be labeling</T3> as defined [by] the Act.''(Italics added.) According to the <T3>Physician's Desk Reference</T3> (PDR) in its <T3>Forward</T3> (40th ed. 1986), ``drug information'' in the PDR is ``preparedby manufacturers, edited and approved by their medical department and/ormedical consultant.'' PDR publishes the information verbatim. <T3>Id.</T3>OSHA is proposing to modify the definition of ``material safety data sheet''under the rule to indicate that a package insert approved by FDA, or anentry in the PDR prepared in accordance with FDA's requirements, be consideredin compliance with the HCS requirements for a MSDS for these products.In addition, the exemption regarding solid drugs is being corrected toread ``<T3>e.g.</T3>, tablets or pills'' rather than ``<T3>i.e.</T3>'' as is currently indicated in the revised final rule (<T3>see, e.g.</T3>, Exs. 5-77, 5-85, and 5-102).The Agency is inviting comment on this issue, particularly from employeeswho would be affected by this modification to ensure that they agree thatthis information is adequate for their protection. The existing exemptionfor labeling would remain in effect, employers would still have to havehazard communication programs where covered, and training would have tobe given to those employees who have not previously been trained regardingthe hazards and protective measures.Although hospitals and health care institutions have not participated inthe rulemaking to date, it appears to OSHA that another issue of concernin these institutions would be labeling of drugs dispensed by a pharmacistto a nurse who gives it to the patient. It is our understanding that thesedispensed drugs may not be marked in any way, and since the nurse doesn'ttransfer the material from the labeled container, the portable containerexemption for labeling would not apply. OSHA invites comment on suggestionsfor dealing with this issue for non-solid drugs.<T3>OMB Determination.</T3> OMB has disapproved ``coverage of any FDA-regulateddrug'' in the non-manufacturing sector because such coverage ``would resultin duplicative paperwork and is unlikely to provide additional informationof any practical utility.'' (Ex. 4-67) Comment is also invited on thisalternative of totally exempting all drugs from any coverage under therule in terms of the non-manufacturing sector workplaces.<T3>Nuisance dust.</T3> Another issue that was raised for comment on theANPR is the coverage of nuisance particulates. Under the HCS, all chemicalsfor which OSHA has a standard, or which are listed in the latest editionof the American Conference on Governmental Industrial Hygienists' (ACGIH)<T3>Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices</T3> annualpublication, are to be considered hazardous in all situations (paragraph(d)(3) (i) and (ii)). OSHA has a generic permissible exposure limit forall nuisance dust. There are also a number of substances listed in thethreshold limit value (TLV) publication which are specifically identifiedas nuisance particulates. These substances are listed by name in the maintable of the TLVs and in Appendix D, entitled ``Some Nuisance Particulates.''The HCS covers any chemicals listed in the TLV publication, so these nuisanceparticulates are in fact part of the ``floor'' of chemicals covered bythe HCS.However, since any dust or particulate can potentially be a ``nuisance.''OSHA decided as a matter of interpretation to limit coverage of this partof the rule to those nuisance particulates specifically listed in AppendixD of the TLV booklet. OSHA further determined that if a substance listedin Appendix D was found not to be included in an employer's hazard communicationprogram, a <T3>de minimis</T3> citation would be issued as long as the substance didnot pose a covered physicial or health hazard other than its nuisance characteristics.A <T3>de minimis</T3> citation has no penalties associated with it, and theemployer has no duty to abate the condition.The majority of those commenting in response to the 1985 ANPR stated thatnuisance dust should not be covered (<T3>see, e.g.</T3>, Exs. 2-12, 2-23, 2-64, 2-77, 2-90, 2-107, 2-128, 2-144,2-167, 2-193, 2-211). Additional comments recommending exclusion of nuisancedusts were received after the final rule as well (Exs. 5-84, 5-86, and5-93). Edison Electric Institute's argument is an example of the commentsreceived (Ex. 2-107):<ITAG tagnum="21">The purposes of the standard can be well-served even with the omissionof nuisance dusts. Any solid (powder, flake, granules) can produce nuisancedusts. Requiring MSDSs on nuisance dusts would be impractical in some cases(<T3>e.g.,</T3> floor sweeping dusts), and of little use in others becausethose do not present a significant health hazard.</ITAG>OSHA proposes in this document to exempt nuisance particulates from coverageof the rule if, when evaluated in accordance with the hazard determinationprovisions in paragraph (d), no evidence is found to indicate that theparticulate presents any physical or health hazards other than possiblybeing a nuisance in the workplace. Comment is invited on this modification.There were a few comments which supported continued coverage of nuisancedust (Exs. 2-30, 2-59, 2-88, and 2-105), and others which addressed specificdusts such as flour (particularly with regard to baker's asthma) (Exs.2-88, 2-153, and 2-166), and grain (Exs. 2-97, 2-125, and 2-160). Withregard to the coverage of flour dust, information concerning the healthor physical hazards of flour dust would have to be evaluated in accordancewith the requirements of the rule to determine if the scientific literatureindicates flour dust presents a health or physical hazard. Eliminationof the coverage of nusiance particulates <T3>per se</T3> does not negate the requirement for performing a hazardevaluation, nor does it automatically delete such substances as flour asa result of deleting the specific coverage of nuisance dusts.<T3>Grain dust.</T3> As mentioned above, a few comments were received inresponse to the ANPR which addressed the coverage of grain dust (Exs. 2-97,2-125, and 2-160). Industry representatives contended that grain dust isa nuisance particulate and should not be covered by the HCS. There weremany more comments submitted following promulgation of the revised finalrule (<T3>see, e.g.</T3>, Exs. 5-2, 5-16, 5-21, 5-32, 5-43, 5-57, 5-104, and5-124). The vast majority of these comments simply objected to grain dustbeing considered a hazardous chemical under the rule, and to OSHA ``adopting''the ACGIH TLV for grain dust.Under the provisions of the original final rule, as well as the revisedfinal, OSHA established a ``floor'' of chemicals which are always consideredto be hazardous under the rule. These include chemicals which OSHA regulates,and chemicals which appear in the latest edition of <T3>Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agentsin the Work Environment,</T3> an annual publication of the American Conferenceof Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) (now entitled <T3>Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices</T3>) (paragraph(d)(3)). ACGIH is a professional society which is widely recognized asan authority in evaluation of the hazards of materials in the workplace,and establishment of recommended permissible exposure levels for thosematerials. During the rulemaking on the original rule, participants confirmedthat if ACGIH finds a material to be hazardous, and thus establishes apermissible level for it, this is important information to be consideredin the hazard determination process. (<T3>See, e.g.</T3>, 48 FR 53298-99.) Therefore, OSHA included this conclusionin the hazard determination process by stating that if the material appearson the ACGIH list, it is, by definition under the rule, a hazardous chemical.Chemicals listed by ACGIH (or regulated by OSHA), however, are not theonly substances covered under the scope of the rule. If there is evidenceto indicate a material presents a physical hazard in the workplace (<T3>e.g.</T3>, flammability or combustibility) or if there is one statisticallysignificant study that indicates a potential adverse health effect mayoccur upon exposure, the chemical is covered by the rule (paragraph (d)(2)).OSHA has not ``adopted'' the threshold limit value (TLV) for any of thesubstances on the TLV list. It has simply stated that the fact that thisrecognized authority has found a substance to be hazardous is importantinformation for exposed employees and users of a product to be aware of,as well as being aware of the level of exposure that authority has recommended.Where OSHA has specific exposure levels, this information must also beindicated on a MSDS, and if the producer has a recommended level_as manylarger manufacturers do_this information must also appear. Thus the downstreamemployers will have the benefit of knowing that such recommendations andrequirements exist, and this will help them design appropriate protectivemeasures for their employees.Whether these materials appeared on the TLV list or not is somewhat immaterialin terms of whether they are covered by the rule since, if they are notlisted, an evaluation still has to be made of the available hazard datato determine if they meet the definition of ``hazardous chemical'' underthe standard. For grain dust, there is evidence that it presents both aphysical hazard (potential for explosion) and a health hazard (there isevidence that respiratory effects result from exposure). (<T3>See, e.g.</T3>, OSHA Final Rule for Grain Handling Facilities, 52 FR49542; Ex. 4-29 (MSDS for grain); Ex. 4-30 (ACGIH documentation for theTLV for grain dust); Ex. 4-43 (OSHA Grain Elevator Industry Hazard Alert,1/5/78); and Ex. 4-49 (U.S. General Accounting Office report on grain fumigation,1981). Thus grain dust would be covered by the rule regardless of whetherthe TLV list is referenced or not. The additional TLV reference merelyensures that the downstream employers are provided the necessary informationabout available recommendations for control of the exposures to the material.OSHA does not agree that it has ``delegated'' its authority to ACGIH underthe rule, and the Agency certainly has not ``adopted'' the TLV under thisrulemaking process. The HCS requires employers to disclose complete andcurrent information on hazardous materials employees are potentially exposedto, and employees are entitled to receive available information on graindust. It is not necessary for the Agency to make individual judgments aboutthe hazards of each chemical under the HCS to determine if it is covered_theHCS is a generic rule which establishes criteria by which these judgmentscan be made by producers of substances, subject to review by OSHA throughits enforcement procedures.OSHA is aware that information such as material safety data sheets on graindust, compliance manuals, and training aids have been developed and arecurrently available in the grain industry (<T3>see, e.g.</T3>, Exs. 4-29, 4-30, 4-43, 4-47, and 4-52).<T3>Radiation and biological hazards.</T3> Although OSHA has never consideredeither radioactivity or biological hazards to be covered by the HCS, wedo periodically receive inquiries regarding such coverage. Therefore, weare taking this opportunity to specifically indicate that these types ofhazards are not covered by the rule. If a radioactive chemical presentsother types of chemical hazards that are not the result of the radioactivityof the chemical, it will be covered for those hazards. Otherwise, the hazardof radioactivity itself is covered under the rules of other Federal agenciesor under OSHA's radiation rules.Definitions <T3>Article. </T3>The issues involving the article definition and exemptionhave already been described in detail in the preceding section. The modifieddefinition for ``article'' being proposed is ``a manufactured item, otherthan a fluid or particle: (i) Which is formed to a specific shape or designduring manufacture; (ii) which has end use function(s) dependent in wholeor in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (iii) which undernormal conditions of use does not release more than very small quantities(<T3>e.g., </T3>minute or trace amounts) of a hazardous chemical (as determinedunder paragraph (d) of this section) and does not pose a physical hazardor a health risk to employees.'' <T3>Commercial account. </T3>As discussed in the preceding discussion onconsumer products. OSHA is proposing a definition for ``commercial account''to help clarify which retail distributors need to maintain MSDSs for theircustomers. The definition proposed is ``commercial account'' means ``anarrangement whereby a retail distributor sells hazardous chemicals to anemployer, generally in large quantities over time and at costs that arebelow the regular retail price.'' <T3>Hazard warning. </T3>Both the original and revised final rules includea definition for ``hazard warning'' which states that it means ``any words,pictures, symbols, or combination thereof which convey the hazard(s) ofthe chemical(s) in the container(s).'' ``Appropriate hazard warnings''are to be put on container labels. Since the rule covers ``physical'' and``health'' <T3>hazards, </T3>specific information regarding these would be requiredon a label to comply. OSHA provided clarification regarding the Agency'sinterpretations of these requirements in the preamble to the revised finalrule (<T3>see, </T3>52 FR 31864). However, since the issue was not related tothe expansion of the scope, no modifications for purposes of clarificationwere proposed at that time. The Agency is taking this opportunity to repeatthe discussion and to propose changes consistent with these interpretationsto clarify the language in the rule itself. Many labels at the time the HCS was promulgated included only precautionarystatements, rather than providing necessary information about the specifichazards of the chemicals. Thus employees encountered statements such as``avoid inhalation'' on virtually every chemical container, but were notprovided with statements regarding what type or severity of effect inhalationcould be expected to produce. OSHA's intent in devising the labeling requirements for the rule was tokeep the required information to a minimum. Although employers could chooseto provide additional statements, OSHA's requirements were to be limitedto the minimal amount necessary to convey the hazards to the workers. Underthe OSHA scheme, other data regarding protective measures, first aid, etc.,are to be included on the material safety data sheet or in training, ratherthan appearing on the label itself. This approach is in keeping with theAgency's evaluation of available data on effectiveness of labels whichindicates that the more detail there is on a label, the less likely itis that employees will read and act on the information. The purpose ofthe label is to serve as an immediate visual warning of the chemical hazardsin the workplace. (<T3>See generally, </T3>48 FR 53300-03). There have been misinterpretations of the requirements made based on statementsin the preamble to the rule concerning various labeling systems (<T3>see </T3>48 FR 53301). This preamble discussion involves format oflabels, and is not an unqualified endorsement of any particular labelingsystem. It simply states that any format may be used, as long as the labelincludes the minimal information required by the standard. It should benoted that it can be expected that some labels prepared in accordance withany of the available labeling systems might be found to be deficient. Again,the preamble discussion cited merely reemphasized that employers are notconstrained to use any particular format or wording, but are constrainedby the necessity to comply with the requirements of the rule concerningthe information to be provided_the identity, the hazards, and for containersleaving the workplace, the name and address of the responsible party.To address questions raised regarding the definition, OSHA has added ``physicaland health'' to modify the term ``hazards'' in the definition. The terms``physical'' and ``health'' hazards are already defined in the rule, andthese are the specific hazards that are to be ``conveyed'' in an ``appropriate''hazard warning. In addition, the phrase ``including target organ effects''is being added to clarify what OSHA considers to be ``health hazards.''It will not necessarily be ``appropriate'' to warn on the label about everyhazard listed in the MSDS. The data sheet is to address essentially everythingthat is known about the chemical. The selection of hazards to be highlightedon the label will involve some assessment of the weight of the evidenceregarding each hazard reported on the data sheet. This does not mean, however,that only acute hazards are to be covered on the label, or that well-substantiatedhazards can be omitted from the label because they appear on the data sheet.It also does not mean that employers preparing labels can eliminate hazardsfrom the labels based on their assessment of the potential risks associatedwith exposure (and, implicitly, their estimates of the exposure levelsin downstream workplaces). A ``hazard'' is an intrinsic property of a chemical,and where there is potential for exposure to that chemical, there is alwaysa potential risk of experiencing adverse health effects. The purpose ofthe HCS is to provide early warning of such effects, thus resulting inavoidance of exposure and subsequently a reduction in risk. The only timea well-substantiated hazard can be omitted from a label is if the chemicalis in a physical state that does not allow exposure to occur (<T3>e.g., </T3>physically bound). It may be ``appropriate'' to provide less detailed information on the chemicalhazards in an in-plant labeling system, where MSDSs and training are readilyavailable, than on a label placed on a container leaving the workplace,where it may provide the only hazard information in certain situationsand where there is no guarantee that the downstream employers handlingor using the chemical will fully understand the less detailed label. Thisdifference in appropriateness allows employers to establish standardizedin-plant labeling systems, as long as training regarding the use of thesesystems is conducted, and MSDSs provide the required, detailed information.OSHA is proposing to modify the labeling provisions in paragraph (f) toclarify the differences in what is required for labels on shipped containersversus what is permitted for labels on in-plant containers. These modificationsare discussed in the section on labels which follows. <T3>ANSI Standard for Precautionary Labeling. </T3>OSHA is aware that theAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI) is in the process of revisingits standard for precautionary labeling (Z129.1-1982) to include, amongother things, guidance for target organ effect labeling. A copy of thelatest version of this document is available in the record (Ex. 4-69).OSHA is inviting comment on whether the Agency should consider statingspecifically (either in the final rule or in a compliance directive) thatthe draft ANSI standard, when finalized, and if acceptable to OSHA, providesemployers with sufficient guidance to produce an acceptable label for compliancewith the HCS. In other words, if the employer follows the guidance providedby ANSI, that would be one way to comply with the requirements of the HCS.Employers would still be free to use other labeling systems or approachesto labeling, where appropriate, as long as they meet the requirements ofthe HCS. But those employers who wish to have more specific guidance tofollow would be able to use the ANSI standard to assist them in complying.OSHA is particularly interested in comments about the extent of targetorgan information that would be on a label under the ANSI scheme, and whetherthis would provide enough information to comply with the HCS. <T3>Material safety data sheet. </T3>As described in the earlier discussionon coverage of drugs, OSHA is proposing to modify the definition of ``materialsafety data sheet'' to mean ``written or printed material concerning ahazardous chemical which is prepared in accordance with paragraph (g) ofthis section. For hazardous chemicals which are drugs regulated by theFood and Drug Administration under the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct (21 U.S.C. 301 <T3>et seq.</T3>), an approved package insert or drug information in the<T3>Physicians' Desk Reference </T3>will be considered a material safetydata sheet for purposes of compliance with this rule in the nonmanufacturingsector.'' Hazard Determination <T3>Mixtures. </T3>OSHA is making one minor correction to the mixture provisions.In paragraph (d)(5)(iv), OSHA requires that hazardous chemical componentsof a mixture in concentrations less than one percent (or in the case ofcarcinogens, less than 0.1 pecent) are covered by the HCS if they can bereleased in concentrations which may exceed an OSHA exposure limit or ACGIHThreshold Limit Value, or could present a health ``hazard'' to employeesin the concentrations released. OSHA incorrectly used the term ``hazard''in this provision. A hazard is an inherent property of the chemical, andwould exist no matter what quantity was present. OSHA intended to referto the presence of a health risk to employees exposed to the chemical.The risk is a function of the inherent hazard and the amount of exposure.Therefore, in accordance with these scientific principles, OSHA is correctingparagraph (d)(5)(iv) to state that such quantities of hazardous chemicalsare always covered by the HCS when they present a health risk to employeesin concentrations below the cut-offs. Written Hazard Communication Program <T3>Mobile worksites. </T3>Under the revised final rule, OSHA includedwhat is termed a mobile worksite provision which permitted employers ofemployees who travel between workplaces during a work shift to maintainMSDSs at the central workplace as long as the information is availableto employees immediately in the event of an emergency (paragraph (g)(9)).Such employees would also have access at the central location prior todeparting for the other sites, and when they return to the central location.This appeared to OSHA to be a reasonable accommodation for such a workoperation, that still provides employees with immediate access to necessaryinformation in an emegency and daily access to all information as a referencesource.Several commenters requested that OSHA clarify that in this situation thewritten hazard communication programs may also be maintained at the centralworkplace (Exs. 5-46, 5-67, 5-79, and 5-110). (<T3>See also,</T3> Ex. L-5-100 which suggests that the mobile worksiteprovision should apply when workers are at a remote site for several days.)Therefore OSHA is proposing to add the following paragraph to the writtenhazard communication program requirements (paragraph (e)(5)):<ITAG tagnum="21">Where employees must travel between workplaces during a workshift,<T3>i.e.,</T3> their work is carried out at more than one geographicallocation, the written hazard communication program may be kept at a centrallocation at the primary workplace facility.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">It should be noted that as in the situation with MSDSs, this exceptionis limited to work operations where employees travel during each day, thusmaking it somewhat impractical to either carry a written program with them,or to have a duplicate copy at each site serviced (such as oil wells).Comment is invited on this exception and its application.<T3>Multi-employer worksite provision.</T3> When OSHA promulgated the originalfinal HCS, there was a requirement in the written hazard communicationprogram that employers include in the plan and implement ``the methodsthe employer will use to inform any contractor employers with employeesworking in the employer's workplace of the hazardous chemicals their employeesmay be exposed to while performing their work, and any suggestions forappropriate protective measures.'' 48 FR 53343, paragraph (e)(1)(iii).This provision was included in the rule to ensure that contractor employershad enough information to protect their employees when performing workon manufacturing sites. Contractors are often used in this context to performsuch tasks as servicing and cleaning out reactor vessels, and their employeesmay be exposed to significant quantities of hazardous chemicals under thosecircumstances.The rule did not address the opposite situation, <T3>i.e.,</T3> where a contractor brings a hazardous chemical to the manufacturingfacility and exposes the manufacturing employer's employees. OSHA receivedmany inquiries from manufacturers concerning this issue. It is apparentlya pervasive problem, and these manufacturers wanted to be able to use someprovision in the rule to compel contractors to provide such information.After a number of informal discussions with interested parties concerninghow manufacturers might resolve this problem, OSHA included a recommendationin its compliance directive (Ex. 4-24) that employers consider includingarrangements for an exchange of hazard information in their contracts.We had been told that this practice was being used successfully by a numberof manufacturers.OSHA believes that this problem of multiple employers using hazardous chemicalson the same site becomes even more pressing when the standard covers thenon-manufacturing sector, particularly in the construction industry. Infact, representatives of the construction industry have long supportedrequirements to ensure information is available to them on such sites.As noted in the preamble to the expanded rule (<T3>see</T3> 52 FR 31858-59), the Advisory Committee on Construction Safetyand Health (ACCSH) made recommendations for signs, labels, MSDSs, and trainingon construction sites as early as 1980 (Ex. 4-4, <T3>Report on Occupational Health Standards for the Construction Industry</T3>(5/16/80)). At that time the Committee felt ``that the construction employerwas not in a position to easily acquire information on the hazards associatedwith the many products and materials used in the industry, but that suchinformation was fundamental to the preparation of warning signs, labels,training programs, and other important job safety and health activities.''52 FR 31859. The HCS did not exist at the time of the report, and the Committeethus recommended that a solution to the problem of lack of informationwould be to modify and extend the existing OSHA standard for material safetydata sheets which at the time applied only to ship repairing, shipbuilding,and ship breaking (29 CFR 1915, 1917, and 1918):<ITAG tagnum="21">The modified standard would require manufacturers or formulators ofharmful materials or agents to supply material safety data sheets alongwith their products in such a fashion that they reach construction employers* * * Under the standard, these data sheets would then be available atthe construction worksite for use by employers and employees.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Furthermore, ACCSH indicated in the same report that worker trainingshould include the ``exact identification of the material or process thatis hazardous,'' ``health effects of the material,'' and ``location andavailability of chemical identification lists and substance data sheets.''ACCSH clearly believed that substance-specific information is necessaryand appropriate on construction sites.This issue was also addressed in a number of comments submitted in responseto the ANPR. For example, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)(Ex. 2-223) addressed the issue of multiple subcontractors:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is crucial that OSHA recognize that any of these subcontractorsmay bring ``hazardous'' materials onto the jobsite, but exposure to thesematerials will not necessarily be limited to employees of that subcontractor.Thus, an electrician may be exposed to paint fumes, and a plumber may beexposed to muriatic acid. Obviously, some system of conveying informationto workers must be developed which accounts for this diverse workforceon the site.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Similarly, the National Erectors Association (Ex. 2-226) suggested:<ITAG tagnum="21">The customer and the general or prime contractor(s) should jointlydevelop and agree on a hazard communication program for that site. Thegeneral or prime contractor should in turn discuss and develop an appropriatehazard communication program with each of the subcontractors which he hascontrol over. MSDS information should be discussed and updated at the weeklytool box safety meetings and the contractor progress meetings.</ITAG>The National Constructors Association (NCA) (Ex. 2-108) also indicatedthat:<ITAG tagnum="21">Another major problem exists in that owner/clients do not automaticallyfurnish their MSDS's to contractors working on the owner/client property,that are or could be, exposed to owner/client controlled hazardous substances.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In a later comment, NCA recommended that language be included in theexpanded scope rule as follows (Ex. 2-225):<ITAG tagnum="21">Contractor employers using hazardous chemicals which may create ahazard to employees of other employers at a multi-employer workplace duringnormal conditions of use, or during a foreseeable emergency shall:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">* * * Inform the other employers of the storage and work locationsof the hazardous chemicals;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">* * * Supply a copy of the material safety data sheet to each employerwho requests a copy;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">* * * Review the material safety data sheet with other employers whosework will be directly affected by the use of the hazardous chemicals.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In addition, NCA included a provision in their recommended standardthat addressed employee access to MSDSs at the worksite: ``The contractoremployer shall maintain copies of the material safety data sheets for eachhazardous chemical used by the contractor employer, or furnished by anotheremployer in the workplace, and shall make them readily accessible duringeach work shift to employees when they are in their work area(s).''The American Road andamp; Transportation Builders Association (Ex. 2-81)also addressed the issue: ``Coordination of responsibility for MSDS access,labeling, and training, again, is necessary * * *. A possible compromisewould be to make the information available where notices are generallyposted, at a central location, where workers often report for work.''The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (Ex. 2-105)reported that contractors are already making MSDSs available on constructionsites:<ITAG tagnum="21">Many contractors now keep a loose-leaf book of MSDSs in their traileron site for each access. Some contractor associations have produced loose-leafbinders that review the chemicals commonly used at worksites, their hazards,and the HCS requirements. There are also numerous private services availableto provide data sheets on microfiche and on-line by computers * * *. Microfichetakes up little space (one loose-leaf binder) * * *. Any contractor witha personal computer could tie into an MSDS data base by purchasing a modem.</ITAG>The International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades (IBPAT) indicatedthat, as a general rule, MSDSs have not been provided automatically tocontractors. However, paint manufacturers have usually provided them whenrequested. Given the short duration of some construction jobs, however,receipt upon request from the manufacturer is too late_the job is completed.``Failure to have the MSDS available ahead of time does not allow a contractorample opportunity to take into consideration the kind of equipment thatmay be necessary to do a job safely * * *.'' (Ex. 2-199). The IBPAT confirmsthat MSDSs are necessary to properly protect painters, regardless of whetherthe paints are industrial coatings or consumer products: ``If the paintmanufacturer has any reason to believe that a product sold will be usedby a professional, then the product should be provided with ways sufficientfor the employer and the user to assure that the employer will receivethe proper MSDS for the product * * *. In general, products purchased byprofessional paint or allied product applicators are used at quicker ratesfor longer periods of time thus the same product will often pose greaterrisk to professionals than consumers. The types of products so purchasedare also extremely varied, ranging from rather benign to extremely hazardous* * *''.In preparing the revised final rule, OSHA took these comments into considerationand included a multi-employer worksite provision in the written hazardcommunication program requirements (52 FR 31880; paragraph (e)(2), as summarizedbelow):<ITAG tagnum="21">Employers who produce, use, or store hazardous chemicals at a workplacein such a way that the employees of other employer(s) may be exposed (forexample, employees of a construction contractor working on-site) shalladditionally ensure that the hazard communication programs developed andimplemented under this paragraph (e) include the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">* * * The methods the employer will use to provide the other employer(s)with a copy of the material safety data sheet, or to make it availableat a central location in the workplace, for each hazardous chemical theother employer(s)' employees may be exposed to while working;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">* * * The methods the employer will use to inform the other employer(s)of any precautionary measures that need to be taken to protect employeesduring the workplace's normal operating conditions and in foreseeable emergencies;and,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">* * * The methods the employer will use to inform the other employer(s)of the labeling system used in the workplace.</ITAG>As described in the preamble to the final rule (52 FR 31865), this typeof provision is necessary to ensure that all employees have sufficientinformation to protect themselves in the workplace, regardless of whichemployer uses the hazardous chemical. It also ensures that employers havethe necessary information to adequately conduct training, and to selectappropriate protective measures for the work operation. Several OSHA-approvedState Plan States have incorporated similar provisions in their expandedscope rules, and have successfully implemented them.ACCSH reviewed the multi-employer worksite provision at its meeting onJune 23, 1987, and did not raise objections to the items addressed, includingthe provision for MSDSs to be made available on multi-employer worksites(Ex. 4-6). ACCSH recommended that provisions regarding material safetydata sheets be amended to preclude use of a chemical on-site prior to receiptof an MSDS (Ex. 4-6, Tr. 218, 222), and that employees who travel betweenworkplaces must have a copy of an MSDS in their vehicles for each chemicalthey will be using (Tr. 243).One member cited an incident which occurred on a construction site involvinga potentially carcinogenic material. The label indicated the potentialcarcinogenic effects, but did not provide suggested protective measures.This is consistent with the HCS since protective measures are only requiredto be included on the MSDS. The job was stopped for three days until thecompany could obtain the MSDS and ascertain from it the protective measuresthey needed to implement to protect the workers. ``This unfortunately iswhat is happening with a lot of labels that are being used today. The labelsare not specific enough, and as a result, the control measures that arenecessary to use that material are not readily available until they geta material safety data sheet and read the details on it.'' Tr. 188.Another member suggested that obtaining and maintaining MSDS informationon a worksite is analogous to obtaining and maintaining instructions forassembling or installing equipment and similar tasks that are commonlyperformed in construction. The paperwork necessary to provide instructionsis routinely provided prior to use as the job would have to be stoppedif it was not received from suppliers at that time. ``If the same urgencywas placed on the MSDS in getting it to the job as it was [on] gettinginstructions on how to put * * * together a piece of equipment on the job,it would arrive there.'' Tr. 190.OSHA decided that the provisions as written adequately addressed the problemsraised, <T3>i.e.,</T3> the standard already requires suppliers to provide the MSDSs,and employers to have MSDSs for each hazardous chemical in the workplace.However. OSHA believes that the ACCSH's discussion of the issues and therecommendations made regarding MSDSs clearly indicate that the Committeedid not envision hazard communication requirements for construction thatdo not include on-site availability of MSDSs.The Committee also suggested that OSHA clarify the language of the ruleto ensure that the written programs are maintained at each worksite, andOSHA adopted that recommendation in the revised final rule. Furthermore,on November 3, 1987, after reviewing the OMB letter regarding the informationcollection requirements of the rule, ACCSH unanimously reaffirmed its positionthat while a separate standard would be preferred for the constructionindustry, ``the Committee does not feel it would be appropriate to exemptor remove protections existing now'' under the HCS, and that the rule continueto apply in construction (Ex. 4-74).As discussed above regarding consumer products, without MSDSs the hazardcommunication program will not be effective. The consensus of the participantsin the rulemaking on the original final rule was that labels can only providelimited information_the detailed source of information must be the MSDS.Furthermore, adequate training cannot be conducted if the information isnot available on the substances involved. As the National Paint and CoatingsAssociation (H-022 Ex. 19-62) stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">NPCA concurs with the Agency's assessment of the function and utilityof the MSDS as the primary component of a Hazard Communications Program***. The label is limited in the amount and detail of hazard informationwhich it can contain and still effectively communicate. The MSDS servesas the source document and amplification of the information presented onthe label ***. NPCA has had a long-standing policy of recommending thatMSDS's be provided to customer/employers even though not as yet requiredby law. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA agrees with NPCA's assessment of the importance of MSDSs, althoughtheir more recent comments do not appear to be consistent with this approachsince they have suggested that MSDSs are not necessary for paint contractors(Ex. 5-75). OSHA believes the need for such information is just as criticalin the non-manufacturing sector where employees are exposed to the samehazardous chemicals as in the manufacturing sector. Many other manufacturersand their representatives concurred with OSHA's conclusion that a programcannot be effective without all of the major components included in theOSHA rule_including MSDSs being available to employees and employers atthe job site (<T3>see, e.g., </T3>H-022 Exs. 19-62, 19-91, 19-124, 19-156, 19-185, and19-199.) The comments received following publication of the final rule are mixedon this issue. One commenter (Ex. 5-108) posed a question that we believedwas answered by the multi-employer worksite provision: ``Although the lawfor training and maintaining MSDS will put the responsibility for theiremployees on the subcontractor, how about the exposure of two or more subcontractors'employees to each other, our exposure to products subcontractors' employeesare using and their employees' exposure to products we are using? Theseare not everyday problems in manufacturing, therefore, here is anothercomplex area that should be considered if the standard is to be expanded.''We agree, and hence addressed it in the written program requirements. Several commenters believed that the provisions would not work becauseof the number of contractors on the site and the potential number of chemicals(Exs. 5-83, 5-84, and 5-89). One suggested alternative, however, was toallow contractors to deposit copies of their MSDSs in a central locationon-site or make them available on some reasonable basis such as in theirtruck. This is already explicitly permitted under the rule. Similarly,the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) testified during the OMBpaperwork meeting (Ex. 5-76, Tr. 53) on the issue of keeping MSDSs on amulti-employer worksite. When questioned as to the feasibility of keepingthem at a central location on the site, NAHB indicated that the preambleto the revised final rule appeared to allow such an option, but the standarddid not. ``Now if OSHA's honest opinion is that a central MSD depositoryon the site will take care of multi-employer worksites, let's see it inthe rule ***.'' <T3>See </T3>paragraph (e)(2)(i) stating that the written program shallinclude methods the employer will use to either ``provide the other employer(s)with a copy of the material safety data sheet or make it available at acentral location in the workplace.'' 52 FR 31880. This is in the rule itself,and appears, therefore, to address NAHB's statement. Some commenters have clearly misinterpreted the requirements of the rulefor multi-employer worksites. For example, the Alliance of the TextileCare Associations (ACTA) (Ex. 6, Tr. 190-198) argued that they would haveto maintain in their facilities MSDSs for all chemicals at their customers'sites. ``An industrial laundry would be required to maintain material safetydata sheets and other information from between 1,000 and 5,000 businesses.If one assumes only very conservatively 10 material safety data sheetsper account, this would mean that an industrial launderer would be confrontedwith between 10,000 and 50,000 material safety data sheets organized byservice route ***.'' The HCS does not require any such collection. First of all, there is no requirement to maintain MSDSs for products atother sites so the launderer would not be required to maintain in its facilitiesany MSDSs from the facilities on its routes. MSDSs are only required forthe chemicals used at the facility of concern. Secondly, service employeeswho are simply picking up and dropping off materials such as describedin this testimony (10 minutes in the facility) are not generally ``working''on that site in the sense of the multi-employer worksite provision, andare probably not ``exposed'' to the chemicals in the facility. The ACTAindicates that the HCS requires training on each and every chemical_thisis not true. The HCS requires training on hazards, and this can be presentedeither by chemical or by categories of hazard (<T3>e.g., </T3>flammability). In most situations, it is more practicaland effective to train by hazard categories. Furthermore, the trainingteaches employees to use substance-specific information available to themon labels and material safety data sheets. The delivery people should receivesuch training, be advised to read lables, and trained to request materialsafety data sheets if they are ``exposed'' in the conduct of their dutiesat the customer's site and need more information. Availability of the MSDSsat the customer's site satisfies the requirements of the rule. Although some of these commenters mentioned the large number of chemicalson-site as being a potential problem, others argued that construction siteshave few hazardous chemicals, and therefore do not need right-to-know programs(<T3>see, e.g., </T3>5-17, 5-58, 5-81, 5-86, 5-108, and 5-117.) However,it was interesting to OSHA to note that the alternative recommended bythese commenters to the rule as written was to require the following (Exs.5-10, 5-65, and 5-117): <ITAG tagnum="21">Post a list of hazardous chemicals at the job site with a copy ofthe MSDS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each contractor is responsible for posting only MSDS for substancesthey are using. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Make available to all employees a list of hazardous substances beingused at site. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Require proper labeling for all hazardous substances prior to purchase.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Require contractors to provide personal protective equipment for theiremployees. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">It appears that if these construction employers are recommending thatMSDSs be maintained at the worksite, they must consider it to be feasibleand appropriate. This worksite accessibility appears to be feasible ateven the smallest sites (IBPAT, Ex. 2-199): <ITAG tagnum="21">The painting contractor usually has an office, a trailer, a hotelroom, a car, a shoe box_somewhere_from which business is conducted andwhere are found documents pertaining to the job, such as bid specs, purchaseorders, employment rosters, coating technical data sheets and so on. Allof these are materials which from time to time during the course of a jobthe employer will be required to make available or use at the job site.MSDS's would be treated similarly. </ITAG>OSHA still believes that the multi-employer worksite provision is criticalto the proper functioning of the rule, and that MSDSs are necessary toensure that proper information is available to both employers and employees.We are inviting further comment on this provision. <T3>OMB Determination. </T3>OMB has stated that the ``practical utilityfor the requirement to bring MSDSs on-site at multi-employer workplaces''has not been demonstrated. According to OMB, an acceptable option wouldbe to ``require employers at multi-employer worksites to keep labels intacton any containers they bring onto the worksite; to train their employeesin the hazards with which they work directly, in recognition of and responseto the general hazards that are likely to be introduced by other employers,and in the need to observe hazard labels on the worksite and request MSDSswhen further information is needed; and to provide MSDSs to other employersupon request.'' OMB has disapproved the ``requirement to bring MSDSs ontomulti-employer worksites.'' OMB's suggested approach ``relies on labelsand general hazard training to protect workers from substances broughtonsite by other employers.'' OSHA invites comment on this approach as well.Labels and Other Forms of WarningAs mentioned previously, OSHA proposes to modify the language in paragraph(f)(5) to clarify what types of hazard warnings are permitted on labelsof in-house chemical containers. OSHA is modifying the rule (paragraph(f)(5)(ii), to clarify that employers may, as an alternative to specifichazard warnings, provide more general hazard information on the labelsas long as the specific physical and health hazards of the chemicals areconveyed through implementation of the other aspects of the hazard communicationprogram (<T3>i.e., </T3>provision of data sheets and training). For example, somelabeling systems indicate the presence of a ``health'' hazard and ratethe severity of that hazard using a number system. The specific healthhazard is not on the label under this system, but is available on the MSDS.Employers using this type of hazard rating system must ensure that theworker has the required ready access to the data sheet, and understandsthe labeling system used and how to obtain and use the information provided.The training program must address these aspects of the employer's hazardcommunication program. Precautionary statements alone are not consideredto be general hazard information under this provision.In the revised final rule, OSHA made a change to the labeling requirementsfor shipments of solid metal. Solid metal is often considered to be an``article'' under the rule, and thus exempt. Where the metal is not an``article'' since its downstream use results in hazardous chemical exposureto employees working with it, a provision was added which allows shippersof this type of material to send the label information once, similar tomaterial safety data sheet transmittal, as long as the material is thesame and it is being shipped to the same customer. In these situations,there should be no hazard to anyone handling the metal from the time itis produced in solid form, until the time someone works on it in a waythat releases a chemical hazard. Since the label information transmittedwould only reflect the chemical hazards released when it is later workedon, the label would not provide any hazard information that is needed bythose handling the material in transit. The label information does servea different purpose than the MSDS as the label is an immediate visual warning,a ``snapshot picture'' of the hazards, whereas the MSDS provides detailedhazard information. It was emphasized that this exception is only for thesolid metal itself_any hazardous chemicals present in conjunction withthe metal in such a form that employees may be exposed when handling thematerial (e.g., cutting fluids, lubricants, and greases), would requirelabels with each shipment.OSHA is proposing to further modify this exception to include wood, plastic,and whole grain. We believe the situation involving wood and plastic isanalogous to solid metal in that the hazard potential is in the downstreamuse and does not involve employees involved in transit. For whole grain,we recognize that some dust may be generated during the transportationprocess, but believe that the repetitive nature of the shipments and therelatively small amount of dust generated due to the handling at this stagemakes such an exemption appropriate. (<T3>See, e.g., </T3>Ex. 5-13, 5-15, 5-21, 5-52, and 5-92.) The Agency invitescomment on this extended exception.Material Safety Data SheetsAs described in more detail above, OSHA is proposing to modify paragraph(g)(7) dealing with the distribution of hazardous chemicals to clarifythe duties of the retail distributor in particular, but also distributorsin general. First of all, the language regarding the general duty for distributorsto provide MSDSs has been modified to track the language in paragraph (g)(6)immediately preceding it regarding the duty of chemical manufacturers andimporters to transmit such information with their initial shipment andwith the first shipment after a material safety data sheet is updated.Previously, the rule simply stated that ``distributors shall ensure thatmaterial safety data sheets, and updated information, are provided to otherdistributors and employers.'' This slight modification clarifies that distributorsare required to provide MSDSs in the same manner that chemical manufacturersand importers do.The paragraph further indicates that retail distributors only need to provideMSDSs if they have commercial accounts for employers purchasing hazardouschemicals. If an employer incidentally purchases a hazardous chemical fromthem, and they are not required to have one available since they don'tuse the chemical or have commercial accounts, then the retail distributor'sduty is limited to providing that employer with the name, address, andtelephone number of the supplier from which the MSDS can be obtained.Employee Information and TrainingOSHA is not proposing to modify the training requirements. However, a numberof comments were received regarding training in construction and the Agencywould like to respond generally to some of the issues raised.Several commenters noted that construction standards already require training,and clarification of the construction training standards is all that isnecessary (Exs. 5-58, 5-86, and 5-108). OSHA agrees that the constructionindustry is unique among the non-manufacturing industries because thereare long-standing requirements for regular training regarding hazardouschemicals (the following are summaries of the relevant subparagraphs of29 CFR 1926.21):<ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The employer shall instruct each employee in the recognition andavoidance of unsafe conditions and the regulations applicable to this workenvironment to control or eliminate any hazards or other exposure to illnessor injury.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Employees required to handle or use poisons, caustics, and otherharmful substances shall be instructed regarding the safe handling anduse, and be made aware of the potential hazards, personal hygiene, andpersonal protective measures required * * * .</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Employees required to handle or use flammable liquids, gases,or toxic materials shall be instructed in the safe handling and use ofthese materials and made aware of the specific requirements contained inSubparts D, F, and other applicable subparts of this part.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Employers who are in compliance with these provisions as requiredwill largely be in compliance with the HCS training provisions as well.The HCS will simply require that construction employers supplement thesealready established training programs with the additional information requiredby the HCS, such as the existence of the rule and the use and availabilityof labels and MSDSs.Coverage of construction employers under the HCS will enable them to providemore effective training under the construction rules because the HCS willensure they are provided with necessary substance-specific informationupon which to base an appropriate training program. It will also enablethem to select more appropriate protective measures for the hazardous chemicalson their sites. As has been previously cited, the Advisory Committee onConstruction Safety and Health has long recognized the construction employers'decreased ability to properly transmit hazard information and design appropriateprotective measures without the labels and MSDSs for the specific products(Ex. 4-4).With regard to suggestions that more guidance be provided for training,OSHA promulgated voluntary training guidelines for employers in 1984. Thesehave recently been reprinted along with all OSHA training requirementsin ``Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines,''OSHA 2254 (revised) (Ex. 4-58). Copies may be obtained from OSHA's publicationoffice at (202) 523-9667.<T3>Addition of Appendix E. </T3>OSHA has included a new nonmandatory appendixin this proposal to provide additional guidance to employers complyingwith the HCS. This appendix suggests the steps an employer should followto achieve compliance, and provides some information regarding how OSHAwill be enforcing the requirements of the HCS. This should assist employersin designing and implementing effective programs.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Analyses of Regulatory Impact, Regulatory Flexibility, and EnvironmentalImpact</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13197, Feb. 19, 1981) requires that a regulatoryanalysis be conducted for any rule having major economic consequences onthe national economy, individual industries, geographical regions, or levelsof government. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) similarly requires the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) to consider the impact of a regulation on small entities.Consistent with these requirements, the Office of Regulatory Analysis (ORA)prepared a preliminary Regulatory Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysisfor the NPRM OSHA expected to publish to expand the Hazard CommunicationStandard (HCS) to the non-manufacturing sector. The preliminary analysisdescribes the industries affected by the standard, some of the potentialbenefits that will accrue to employees exposed to hazardous chemicals attheir places of work, the costs of compliance with the standard, and thetechnological and economic feasibility of the provisions. It was completedJuly 1, 1987, and was submitted to the OSHA Docket (Ex. 4-1) on August14, 1987. As has been described more fully above, OSHA was ordered by theThird Circuit to expand the rule based on the record developed by the Agencyat the time of the 1983 rule. The impact analyses prepared after that timeperiod were summarized in the preamble to the final rule and made availablein the docket because they provided supplemental evidence of the economicand technological feasibility of the expansion of the scope. The currentNPRM is merely a revision of the already promulgated expansion of the scope,and any further analyses are related solely to that revision. The analysesperformed prior to publication of the final rule are not being revised.However, OSHA is taking this opportunity to discuss some issues that havebeen raised related to those analyses. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>U.S. Small Business Administration, Exs. 4-88 and 5-93.To ensure that the Agency had all available information regarding the economicfeasibility of extending the HCS to nonmanufacturing industries, OSHA invitedthe public to submit additional data and evidence pertaining to feasibilityat the time of the publication of the final rule.A number of comments were received. Many of these comments provided nospecific data or evidence regarding either the costs or the analysis, butrather simply indicated that the costs would be larger than estimated.OSHA maintained that the economic methodology used in the analysis is appropriate,and the costs are based on reasonable assumptions. In general, three specific criticisms were made regarding the approachto the analysis: (a) The data used by ORA from the National Institute forOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) National Occupational Hazard Survey(NOHS) and the National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES) to estimatethe number of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) which a given establishmentwould be required to maintain are inappropriate and have resulted in lowcost estimates for maintaining MSDSs; (b) the estimate of two hours ofprofessional time required for providing a written program is too low;and (c) the cost estimates related to the Superfund Amendment and ReauthorizationAct (SARA), Title III, Sections 311 and 312, are too low. The Office of Regulatory Analysis used the same approach to estimatingcosts associated with the Hazard Communication Standard for nonmanufacturingthat it did for manufacturing. This methodology was successfully used todetermine the potential costs of the Hazard Communication Standard formanufacturing, and use of the same approach ensured comparability of theanalyses. In the 1983 analysis, OSHA relied on exposure data from the NIOSHNational Occupational Hazard Survey conducted between 1972 and 1974 toestimate the extent of exposure to hazardous chemicals, and thus the numbersof MSDSs that would be required. Few comments were received on this approach,although some manufacturers argued that these data had been collected tenyears prior to use in the OSHA analysis, and that the industries' characteristicshad changed (Docket H-022, Exs. 19-44, 19-76, 19-91, 19-147). However,the NOHS was the only data source available to OSHA to obtain these typesof estimates and it was used in the final impact analysis for the 1983rule. OSHA considered this concern in preparation of the analysis for the rule'sexpansion to the nonmanufacturing sector, and subsequently utilized unpublisheddata from the National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES), conducted between1981 and 1983, to estimate the average number of MSDSs that would haveto be maintained by nonmanufacturing firms under the extended HCS. The NOES and NOHS surveys were conducted by NIOSH to gather informationconcerning the number of physical, chemical, and biological hazards towhich a worker is potentially exposed in the workplace. The NOHS surveywas conducted from 1972-1974 and consisted of samples from 5,200 facilitiesin 67 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas and included establishmentsof all sizes in assorted industries. The NOES survey was conducted from1981-1983 and consisted of samples from 4,490 establishments in 98 geographicareas and was also representative of facilities of all sizes in many industries.In order to estimate the number of products for which a firm must maintainan MSDS, the NOES survey data was used wherever possible because it wasmore recent than the NOHS data and it collected information on trade nameproducts. While the principal objective of the survey was to assess thenumber of chemical (as well as physical and biological) agents to whicha worker is potentially exposed, when NOES surveyors observed productsbeing used which were known only by trade name, they wrote down manufacturinginformation about the products and researched the chemical ingredientswhen the field work of the survey was complete. In this way NIOSH couldeventually determine which chemical agents workers are exposed to whileusing a product. OSHA requested the unpublished NOES data from NIOSH after the field workwas completed, but before the trade name products were broken down intotheir constituent chemicals. Consequently, the NOES data used by ORA isa count of actual products containing hazardous chemicals to which a workeris potentially exposed and is therefore representative of the number ofMSDSs an employer will be required to maintain under the Hazard CommunicationStandard. The product orientation of the 1982 NOES survey was consistentwith OSHA's needs in assessing the MSDS requirements of HCS. The HCS requiresa MSDS for a mixture or product, not for each chemical constituent of thatmixture. Although some employers have chosen to maintain the MSDSs foreach component when mixture-specific information does not exist_and OSHApermits that approach_it is not required and a product MSDS is always preferable.When NOES product data were unavailable, earlier NOHS chemical specificdata were used after they were adjusted downward to make the numbers comparableto the newer, product-oriented NOES data. Some criticisms of the appropriatenessof the NIOSH data evidently arose from the belief that OSHA should estimatethe number of chemicals handled rather than the total number of products.This approach would not be consistent with the requirements of the rule.It is also interesting to note that another concern expressed by the manufacturingindustries about the NOHS data was that it overcounted the number of potentialhazards. The Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) submitted materialto the docket (H-022, Ex. 19-76) which discussed the NOHS data base. CMA'sfear was that OSHA's reliance on the NOHS data may ``overstate the existinghazards presented by chemicals in the workplace,'' and that the resultsof an exhaustive review of the NOHS report by the Franklin Research Centerconcluded that ``occupational exposure to potential carcinogens has beengreatly overestimated.'' However, NIOSH's testimony confirmed the validityof using the NOHS data for estimation of hazardous chemical exposures,and certainly the NOHS and NOES data are the best information availablethat is based upon a large sampling of industry types and sizes. (<T3>See </T3>48 FR 53282).The data used by ORA from the NOES are averages. OSHA expects that someestablishments in the nonmanufacturing industries will maintain more MSDSsthan the average, just as some establishments will maintain fewer. Consequently,examples of firms with more than the average number of chemicals do notinvalidate the survey (<T3>see</T3> 5-93). Furthermore, it should be noted that OSHA's estimatesare for the number of hazardous chemical products at a facility or site,not for an inventory of all the chemicals a firm may have at multiple sites.The HCS also only requires that a firm maintain one MSDS for a particularchemical_where multiple suppliers are used, the chemical is only countedonce.  Another issue raised in the record was the appropriateness of reducingthe number of hours required for preparing a written program for non-manufacturingfacilities from the estimate used in the analysis for the manufacturingsector (Ex. 5-93; Ex. 6). In considering a standard for nonmanufacturing,OSHA carefully considered the differences between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing,as well as its experience in implementing the rule in the manufacturingsector. There are generally fewer hazardous chemicals and chemical hazardexposures in nonmanufacturing industries (this was addressed by the Court,<T3>see</T3> 52 FR 31853), and OSHA took this into account in estimatingthe average of eight hours of professional time required annually to developand administer a training program in nonmanufacturing (as opposed to theaverage 16 hours estimated for a typical firm in manufacturing). Also,the average of two hours allowed to develop a written plan was seen asreasonable for a typical firm in nonmanufacturing, as opposed to the averageof eight hours estimated for a typical firm in manufacturing.  OSHA assumed that a substantial savings of compliance effort would resultas trade associations, other organizations (such as professional societies),and private sector service providers offer pre-packaged outlines to non-manufacturerscomplying with the Hazard Communication Standard for a minimal fee. OSHA,Supporting Statement for Information Collection Requirements of the HazardCommunication Standard, at II-4 (September 1987). Public and private organizationshad provided such guidance to manufacturers covered by the original HCSand to employers covered by state laws. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Exs. 4-24 (OSHA inspection procedures for the HCS,29 CFR 1910.1200); 4-26 (U.S. Department of Agriculture, <T3>Hazard Communication: A Program Guide for Federal Agencies</T3> (August1987)); 4-35 (Right to Know Compliance Kit from Academic Products) (availablein bulk quantities for $12 per kit); 4-41 (sample written programs fromthe Refractories Institute and the State of Oregon); 4-65 (Associationof Graphic Arts's written program) (free to members).  OMB, however, has determined under authority of the Paperwork ReductionAct that OSHA cannot take into account at this point the savings generatedby compliance guides developed to date, or assumed to be developed in thenear future, when calculating the information collection burdens of therule. OMB believes that an additional administrative effort by OSHA, however,``could substantially reduce the start-up paperwork burden and costs ofthe HCS, particularly those of small businesses.'' OSHA is pursuing severalmethods of providing continued guidance to employers attempting to complywith the performance-oriented HCS, and notes that compliance aids havebeen produced by other public and private organizations as anticipated.<T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g</T3>., Exs. 4-47 (news clipping from Farm and Dairy, Salem, Ohio,noting Grain Elevator and Processing Society's development of HCS compliancematerials); 4-83 (materials developed by the AFL-CIO regarding right-to-know);4-90 (sample written program and guidelines for compliance published inthe journal <T3>Professional Safety</T3>); 4-105 (``Countdown to Compliance'') (pamphletprepared by 28 construction trade associations); 4-112 (Maryland OccupationalSafety and Health Division's model training program for construction);4-113 (materials developed by the National Solid Waste Management Association);4-114 (<T3>PIA Hazard Communication Manual: A Suggested Model Program for PrintingPlants</T3>); and 4-115 (Food Marketing Institute's <T3>Guidelines for Complying with OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard</T3>). The third concern expressed by industry was ORA's cost estimate of TitleIII of SARA, sections 311 and 312. Several comparisons have been made betweenOSHA's analysis and an alternative analysis prepared by EPA (<T3>see</T3> Exs. L-5-129 and 5-93). EPA used in its analysis several ofthe assumptions it made when estimating the costs of Title III to the manufacturingsector. Many of these assumptions are considered by OSHA to be inappropriatefor firms in the nonmanufacturing sector. For example, EPA calculated thatover five hours of technical time, over five hours of managerial time,and forty minutes of secretarial time would be needed to set up a filingand recordkeeping system for Tier I forms once they are filled out. ORAbelieves this estimate seriously overstates the time it will take a clericalemployee to establish a filing and recordkeeping system for the typicalnonmanufacturing firm. EPA based its estimate of the number of affectedestablishments for specific reporting thresholds on an average of manufacturingdata from New Jersey and Michigan, and nonmanufacturing data from Michigan,and made no allowance for the fact that establishments in different SIC'sand of different sizes will be affected differently by EPA's establishmentof threshold reporting quantities (<T3>i.e., </T3>the amount of a chemical that must be present to triggerthe reporting requirements). In preparing its estimates ORA consideredeach type of industry, as categorized by the Standard Industrial Classification(SIC) codes, and the likelihood of chemicals being used in the quantitiesestablished by EPA for reporting, to assess how each industry would beaffected for each different size of establishment. Clearly, industriessuch as banking or real estate are not represented by data based on a surveyof manufacturing facilities. Thus OSHA believes its analysis is more appropriatethan a straight percentage based on two unrepresentative data sources.The documentation submitted to the OSHA docket after the current rule waspublished does not provide sufficient evidence for OSHA to conclude thatthe Hazard Communication Standard is infeasible in any industry. Althoughthere are claims from the construction industry that costs are underestimatedby OSHA and it is therefore infeasible for this industry to comply (<T3>see e.g., </T3>Exs. 5-65, 5-83, and 5-86), many firms in the constructionindustry have been subject to state hazard communication laws for the lastseveral years. The construction industry has also been subject for manyyears to the requirements of 29 CFR 1926.21, which establishes the obligationto train construction workers in the recognition and the safe handlingof hazardous substances. In this regard the Hazard Communication Standardhas added very few additional training responsibilities. OSHA's cost estimatesfocus only on new duties, not on the burdens of pre-existing standards.If OSHA were to rely on some or all of the assertions in the record regardingestimates of the time involved in complying with the Standard, and estimatesof the number of MSDSs which would be generated by the imposition of theStandard, the Standard would still be feasible in every SIC. Consequently,OSHA finds that claims of infeasible costs are not substantiated by anyanalysis or evidence, and that nothing in the record supports a conclusionof infeasibility in any SIC.As has already been detailed in this preamble, the NPRM is proposing somemodifications to the provisions of the revised final rule and clarifyingother provisions. OSHA expects that these limited modifications will noteliminate protections of the rule, but will make the standard more cost-effective.OSHA does not consider this NPRM to be either a major or significant rule.In addition, the changes are too subtle for the economic model to be ableto reflect the decreases in the costs. However, it is expected that ifthe proposed changes are implemented the costs will be somewhat reduced.Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>the Assistant Secretary certifies that the proposalscontained in this document will not, if promulgated, have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This NPRM proposesfew substantive changes to the HCS promulgated on August 24, 1987. Thelimited substantive changes would not eliminate protections already providedby the rule, but would make the standard more cost-effective. As notedin the discussion above regarding the regulatory impact analysis, the proposedchanges are too subtle to be quantified by the economic model used to calculatecompliance costs of the HCS. It is expected, however, that if the proposedchanges are implemented, the compliance costs would be somewhat reducedfor small businesses.A regulatory impact and regulatory flexibility analysis was prepared byOSHA for the August 1987 revised HCS (Ex. 4-1 <T2>XX</T2>. <T3>See also </T3>52 FR 31867-76 (summary of analyses). OSHA analyzed theimpact of expanding the coverage of the HCS from the manufacturing sectorto all employers within OSHA's jurisdiction. Economic impacts were analyzedfor each provision of the rule; for each of fifty business classificationsas indicated by their two-digit Standard Industrial Classification Codes;and for four employment size classes (1-19; 20-99; 100-249; and greaterthan 250). The majority of non-manufacturers are small businesses withfewer than 20 employees, and the effects of the HCS on small businesseswere analyzed. <T3>Id. </T3>at 31869, 75-76 (tables 9 and 10). It should be noted, however,that although a particular workplace may be considered a small businessbased upon the number of employees at that site, many of these businessesare actually part of large corporations with significant safety and healthresources (<T3>e.g., </T3>fast food franchises, retail store chains). OSHA's analysesindicated that the HCS's compliance costs would be a negligible percentage(less than one-half of one percent) of the typical small business' averageannual revenue. <T3>Id. </T3>at 31869, 75 (table 9). In addition, no disproportionate impactwas foreseen for small businesses when compared to large businesses. <T3>Id. </T3>at 31870, 75-76 (table 10).OSHA believes that it has minimized the economic impact of the HCS on smallentities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, while accomplishingthe objectives of the OSH Act. The HCS is a performance-oriented rule whichbenefits small employers by allowing them to choose compliance methodsbest suited for their individual workplaces. The HCS is also tailored forsome work operations found in small businesses to ensure that the standardis practical and cost-effective in communicating hazards to workers. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(3). (laboratories); (b)(4), (handlingof sealed containers); (b)(5), (container labeling exemptions); (b)(6),(products totally exempted). <T3>See also </T3>52 FR 31858. In addition, OSHA-developed compliance guidelines,such as proposed Appendix E, will directly benefit small businesses byclarifying and simplifying compliance efforts.The U.S. Small Business Administration has submitted a number of commentsconcerning the impact of the standard on small businesses (<T3>see, e.g., </T3>Exs. 4-88 and 5-93). These comments have been consideredby OSHA, and those involving specific provisions have been addressed inthe discussions of the issues raised in this proposed rule.As noted in the August 24, 1987, <T4>Federal Register </T4>publication, OSHA's analysis (Ex. 4-1) is availablefor public inspection and copying in OSHA's Docket Office, Room N3670,200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210; telephone (202) 523-7894.OSHA invites the public to comment on the effects the proposed changesto the HCS will have on small entities, and to suggest alternatives tothe proposed changes which would minimize any significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities while accomplishing the objectivesof the HCS and the OSH Act.Environmental Assessment_Finding of No Significant ImpactIn accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321<T3>et seq.</T3>), the Council on Environmental Quality guidelines (40CFR Part 1500), and the Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 11),the Assistant Secretary for OSHA has determined that this proposed rulewill not have a significant environmental impact. As concluded previously,the current standard will not significantly affect the quality of the humanenvironment outside the workplace. 52 FR 31870; 48 FR 53333-34. Labelingof containers will not have a direct or significant impact on air or waterquality, land or energy use, or solid waste disposal outside of the workplace.Similarly, the requirements for preparation of a written compliance plan,provision and maintenance of MSDSs, and provision of information and trainingshould not have an adverse environmental impact. Accordingly, this document'sproposed modifications to the HCS also will not have a significant impacton the environment outside the workplace.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Clearance of Information Collection Requirements</ITAG>The information collection requirements of the 1987 revised final standardwere reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the authorityof the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). OSHA subsequently published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>the approval numbers for the rule (1218-0072),and OMB's letter regarding its disapproval of several items (December 4,1987, 52 FR 46075; Ex. 4-67). As discussed above, OMB disapproved: (1)The requirement that material safety data sheets be provided on multi-employerworksites; (2) coverage of any consumer product that falls within the ``consumerproducts'' exemption included in section 311(e)(3) of the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986; and (3) coverage of any drugs regulatedby the Food and Drug Administration in the non-manufacturing sector. Inaddition, OMB determined that OSHA should reopen the rulemaking on theHCS to consider alternatives to the definition of ``article'' which wasincluded in both the original and revised final rules. Lastly, OMB conditionedpaperwork approval upon OSHA's consulting with the U.S. Small BusinessAdministration and the Department of Commerce in order to develop a planfor a Federal administrative effort that will provide assistance to theregulated industries to alleviate the paperwork burdens and costs. On April13, 1988, OMB extended until April 1991 the approval of all provisionsexcept the three that were previously disapproved.In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act and its implementing regulationsissued by OMB (5 CFR Part 1320), OSHA certifies that it has submitted theinformation collection requirements contained in this proposed revisionto its current standards to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of thatAct. Comments on these information collection requirements may be submittedby interested parties to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairsof OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration, 726 Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC 20503. OSHA requeststhat copies of such comments also be submitted to the OSHA Docket Officeas part of the record for this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

State Plan Applicability</ITAG>The 25 States with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and healthplans must adopt a comparable standard within six months of the publicationdate of a final standard. These States include: Alaska, Arizona, California(operating only in the public sector), Connecticut (for State and localgovernment employees only), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland,Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York (for State and localgovernment employees only), North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, SouthCarolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington,and Wyoming. Until such time as a State standard is promulgated, FederalOSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate.Although a State HCS becomes effective in accordance with State promulgationprovisions, and is enforceable upon promulgation, OSHA must also reviewand approve the standard to assure that it is ``at least as effective''as the Federal standard. OSHA intends to closely scrutinize State standardssubmitted under current or future State plans to assure not only equalor greater effectiveness, but also that any additional requirements donot conflict with, or adversely affect, the effectiveness of the nationalapplication of OSHA's standard. Because the HCS is ``applicable to products''in that it permits the distribution and use of hazardous chemicals in commerceonly if they are in labeled containers accompanied by material safety datasheets, OSHA must determine in its review whether any State plan standardprovisions which differ from the Federal are ``required by compelling localconditions and do not unduly burden interstate commerce.''

They also need to knowwhat protective measures are available to prevent adverse effects fromoccurring. The HCS is designed to provide employees with the informationthey need. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Knowledge acquired under the HCS will help employers provide saferworkplaces for their employees. When employers have information about thechemicals being used, they can take steps to reduce exposures, substituteless hazardous materials, and establish proper work practices. These effortswill help prevent the occurrence of work-related illnesses and injuriescaused by chemicals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The HCS addresses the issues of evaluating and communicating hazardsto workers. Evaluation of chemical hazards involves a number of technicalconcepts, and is a process that requires the professional judgment of experiencedexperts. That's why the HCS is designed so that employers who simply usechemicals, rather than produce or import them, are not required to evaluatethe hazards of those chemicals. Hazard determination is the responsibilityof the producers and importers of the materials. Producers and importersof chemicals are then required to provide the hazard information to employersthat purchase their products. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Employers that don't produce or import chemicals need only focus onthose parts of the rule that deal with establishing a workplace programand communicating information to their workers. This appendix is a generalguide for such employers to help them determine what's required under therule. It does not supplant or substitute for the regulatory provisions,but rather provides a simplified outline of the steps an average employerwould follow to meet those requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">1. Becoming Familiar With the Rule </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA has provided a simple summary of the HCS in a pamphlet entitled``Chemical Hazard Communication,'' OSHA Publication Number 3084. Some employersprefer to begin to become familiar with the rule's requirements by readingthis pamphlet. A copy may be obtained from your local OSHA Area Office,or by contacting the OSHA Publications Office at (202) 523-9667.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The standard is long, and some parts of it are technical, but thebasic concepts are simple. In fact, the requirements reflect what manyemployers have been doing for years. You may find that you are alreadylargely in compliance with many of the provisions, and will simply haveto modify your existing programs somewhat. It you are operating in an OSHA-approvedState Plan State, you must comply with the State's requirements, whichmay be different than those of the Federal rule. Many of the State PlanStates had hazard communication or ``right-to-know'' laws prior to promulgationof the Federal rule. Employers in State Plan States should contact theirState OSHA offices for more information regarding applicable requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The HCS requires information to be prepared and transmitted regardingall hazardous chemicals. The HCS covers both physical hazards (such asflammability), and health hazards (such as irritation, lung damage, andcancer). Most chemicals used in the workplace have some hazard potential,and this will be covered by the rule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One difference between this rule and many others adopted by OSHA isthat this one is performance-oriented. That means that you have the flexibilityto adapt the rule to the needs of your workplace, rather than having tofollow specific, rigid requirements. It also means that you have to exercisemore judgment to implement an appropriate and effective program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The standard's design is simple. Chemical manufacturers and importersmust evaluate the hazards of the chemicals they produce or import. Usingthat information, they must then prepare labels for containers, and moredetailed technical bulletins called material safety data sheets (MSDS).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Chemical manufacturers, importers, and distributors of hazardous chemicalsare all required to provide the appropriate labels and material safetydata sheets to the employers to which they ship the chemicals. The informationis to be provided automatically. Every container of hazardous chemicalsyou receive must be labeled, tagged, or marked with the required information.Your supplier must also send you a properly completed material safety datasheet (MSDS) at the time of the first shipment of the chemical, and withthe next shipment after the MSDS is updated with new and significant informationabout the hazards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">You can rely on the information received from your supplier. You haveno independent duty to analyze the chemical or evauate the hazards or it.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Employers that ``use'' hazardous chemicals must have a program toensure the information is provided to exposed employees. ``Use'' meansto package, handle, react, or transfer. This is an intentionally broadscope, and includes any situation where a chemical is present in such away that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or ina foreseeable emergency. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The requirements of the rule that deal specifically with the hazardcommunication program are found in the standard in paragraphs (e), writtenhazard communication program (f), labels and other forms of warning; (g),material safety data sheets; and (h), employee information and training.The requirements of these paragraphs should be the focus on your attention.Concentrate on becoming familiar with them, using paragraph (b), scopeand application, and (c), definitions, as references when needed to helpexplain the provisions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are two types of work operations where the coverage of the ruleis limited. These are laboratories and operations where chemicals are onlyhandled in sealed containers (<T3>e.g.,</T3> a warehouse). The limited provisions for these workplacescan be found in paragraph (b), scope and application. Basically, employershaving these types of work operations need only keep labels on containersas they are received; maintain material safety data sheets that are received,and give employees access to them; and provide information and trainingfor employees. Employers do not have to have written hazard communicationprograms and lists of chemicals for these types of operations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The limited coverage of laboratories and sealed container operationsaddresses the obligation of an employer to the workers in the operationsinvolved, and does not affect the employer's duties as a distributor ofchemicals. For example, a distributor may have warehouse operations whereemployees would be protected under the limited sealed container provisions.In this situation, requirements for obtaining and maintaining MSDSs arelimited to providing access to those received with containers while thesubstance is in the workplace, and requesting MSDSs when employees requestaccess for those not received with the containers. However, as a distributorof hazardous chemicals, that employer will still have responsibilitiesfor providing MSDSs to downstream customers at the time of the first shipmentand when the MSDS is updated. Therefore, although they may not be requiredfor the employees in the work operation, the distributor may, nevertheless,have to have MSDSs to satisfy other requirements of the rule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">2. Identify Responsible Staff</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Hazard communication is going to be a continuing program in your facility.Compliance with the HCS is not a ``one shot deal.'' In order to have asuccessful program, it will be necessary to assign responsibility for boththe initial and ongoing activities that have to be undertaken to complywith the rule. In some cases, these activities may already be part of currentjob assignments. For example, site supervisors are frequently responsiblefor on-the-job training sessions. Early identification of the responsibleemployees, and involvement of them in the development of your plan of action,will result in a more effective program design. Evaluation of the effectivenessof your program will also be enhanced by involvement of affected employees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For any safety and health program, success depends on commitment atevery level of the organization. This is particularly true for hazard communication,where success requires a change in behavior. This will only occur if employersunderstand the program, and are committed to its success, and if employeesare motivated by the people presenting the information to them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">3. Identify Hazardous Chemicals in the Workplace</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The standard requires a list of hazardous chemicals in the workplaceas part of the written hazard communication program. The list will eventuallyserve as an inventory of everything for which an MSDS must be maintained.At this point, however, preparing the list will help you complete the restof the program since it will give you some idea of the scope of the programrequired for compliance in your facility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The best way to prepare a comprehensive list is to survey the workplace,Purchasing records may also help, and certainly employers should establishprocedures to ensure that in the future purchasing procedures result inMSDSs being received before a material is used in the workplace.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The broadest possible perspective should be taken when doing the survey.Sometimes people think of ``chemicals'' as being only liquids in containers.The HCS covers chemicals in all physical forms_liquids, solids, gases,vapors, fumes, and mists_whether they are ``contained'' or not. The hazardousnature of the chemical and the potential for exposure are the factors whichdetermine whether a chemical is covered. If it's not hazardous, it's notcovered. If there is no potential for exposure (<T3>e.g.</T3>, the chemical is inextricably bound and cannot be released),the rule does not cover the chemical.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Look around. Identify chemicals in containers, including pipes, butalso think about chemicals generated in the work operations. For example,welding fumes, dusts, and exhaust fumes are all sources of chemical exposures.Read labels provided by suppliers for hazard information. Make a list ofall chemicals in the workplace that are potentially hazardous. For yourown information and planning, you may also want to note on the list thelocation(s) of the products within the workplace, and an indication ofthe hazards as found on the label. This will help you as you prepare therest of your program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Paragraph (b), scope and application, includes exemptions for variouschemicals or workplace situations. After compiling the complete list ofchemicals, you should review paragraph (b) to determine if any of the itemscan be eliminated from the list because they are exempted materials. Forexample, food, drugs, and cosmetics brought into the workplace for employeeconsumption are exempt. So rubbing alcohol in the first aid kit would notbe covered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Once you have compiled as complete a list as possible of the potentiallyhazardous chemicals in the workplace, the next step is to determine ifyou have received material safety data sheets for all of them. Check yourfiles against the inventory you have just compiled. If any are missing,contact your supplier and request one. It is a good idea to document theserequests, either by copy of a letter or a note regarding telephone conversations.If you have MSDSs for chemicals that are not on your list, figure out why.Maybe you don't use the chemical anymore. Or maybe you missed it in yoursurvey. Some suppliers do provide MSDSs for products that are not hazardous.These do not have to be maintained by you.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">You should not allow employees to use any chemicals for which youhave not received an MSDS. The MSDS provides information you need to ensureproper protective measures are implemented <T3>prior </T3>to exposure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">4. Preparing and Implementing a Hazard Communication Program</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All workplaces where employees are exposed to hazardous chemicalsmust have a written plan which describes how the standard will be implementedin that facility. Preparation of a plan is not just a paper exercise_allof the elements must be implemented in the workplace in order to be incompliance with the rule. <T3>See </T3>paragraph (e) of the standard for the specific requirementsregarding written hazard communication programs. The only work operationswhich do not have to comply with the written plan requirements are laboratoriesand work operations where employees only handle chemicals in sealed containers.<T3>See</T3> paragraph (b), scope and application, for the specific requirementsfor these two types of workplaces.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The plan does not have to be lengthy or complicated. It is intendedto be a blueprint for implementation of your program_an assurance thatall aspects of the requirements have been addressed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many trade associations and other professional groups have providedsample programs and other assistance materials to affected employers. Thesehave been very helpful to many employers since they tend to be tailoredto the particular industry involved. You may wish to investigate whetheryour industry trade groups have developed such materials.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although such general guidance may be helpful, you must remember thatthe written program has to reflect what you are doing in your workplace.Therefore, if you use a generic program it must be adapted to address thefacility it covers. For example, the written plan must list the chemicalspresent at the site, indicate who is to be responsible for the variousaspects of the program in your facility, and indicate where written materialswill be made available to employees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If OSHA inspects your workplace for compliance with the HCS, the OSHAcompliance officer will ask to see your written plan at the outset of theinspection. In general, the following items will be considered in evaluatingyour program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The written program must describe how the requirements for labelsand other forms of warning, material safety data sheets, and employee informationand training, are going to be met in your facility. The following discussionprovides the type of information compliance officers will be looking forto decide whether these elements of the hazard communication program havebeen properly addressed:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">A. Labels and Other Forms of Warning</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In-plant containers of hazardous chemicals must be labeled, tagged,or marked with the identity of the material and appropriate hazard warnings.Chemical manufacturers, importers, and distributors are required to ensurethat every container of hazardous chemicals they ship is appropriatelylabeled with such information and with the name and address of the produceror other responsible party. Employers purchasing chemicals can rely onthe labels provided by their suppliers. If the material is subsequentlytransferred by the employer from a labeled container to another container,the employer will have to label that container unless it is subject tothe portable container exemption. <T3>See </T3>paragraph (f) for specific labeling requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The primary information to be obtained from an OSHA-required labelis an identity for the material, and appropriate hazard warnings. The identityis any term which appears on the label, the MSDS, and the list of chemicals,and thus links these three sources of information. The identity used bythe supplier may be a common or trade name (``Black Magic Formula''), ora chemical name (1,1,1,-trichloroethane). The hazard warning is a briefstatement of the hazardous effects of the chemical (``flammable,'' ``causeslung damage''). Labels frequently contain other information, such as precautionarymeasures (``do not use near open flame''), but this information is providedvoluntarily and is not required by the rule. Labels must be legible, andprominently displayed. There are no specific requirements for size or color,or any specified text.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With these requirements in mind, the compliance officer will be lookingfor the following types of information to ensure that labeling will beproperly implemented in your facility:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Designation of person(s) responsible for ensuring labeling of in-plantcontainers;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Designation of person(s) responsible for ensuring labeling of anyshipped containers;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Description of labeling system(s) used;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Description of written alternatives to labeling of in-plant containers(if used); and,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Procedures to review and update label information when necessary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Employers that are purchasing and using hazardous chemicals_ratherthan producing or distributing them_will primarily be concerned with ensuringthat every purchased container is labeled. If materials are transferredinto other containers, the employer must ensure that these are labeledas well, unless they fall under the portable container exemption (paragraph(f)(7)). In terms of labeling systems, you can simply choose to use thelabels provided by your suppliers on the containers. These will generallybe verbal text labels, and do not usually include numerical rating systemsor symbols that require special training. The most important thing to rememberis that this is a continuing duty_all in-plant containers of hazardouschemicals must always be labeled. Therefore, it is important to designatesomeone to be responsible for ensuring that the labels are maintained asrequired on the containers in your facility, and that newly purchased materialsare checked for labels prior to use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">B. Material Safety Data Sheets</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Chemical manufacturers and importers are required to obtain or developa material safety data sheet for each hazardous chemical they produce orimport. Distributors are responsible for ensuring that their customersare provided a copy of these MSDSs. Employers must have an MSDS for eachhazardous chemical which they use. Employers may rely on the informationreceived from their suppliers. The specific requirements for material safetydata sheets are in paragraph (g) of the standard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is no specified format for the MSDS under the rule, althoughthere are specific information requirements. OSHA has developed a non-mandatoryformat, OSHA Form 174, which may be used by chemical manufacturers andimporters to comply with the rule. The MSDS must be in English. You areentitled to receive from your supplier a data sheet which includes allof the information required under the rule. If you do not receive one automatically,you should request one. If you receive one that is obviously inadequate,with, for example, blank spaces that are not completed, you should requestan appropriately completed one. If your request for a data sheet or fora corrected data sheet does not produce the information needed, you shouldcontact your local OSHA Area Office for assistance in obtaining the MSDS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The role of MSDSs under the rule is to provide detailed informationon each hazardous chemical, including its potential hazardous effects,its physical and chemical characteristics, and recommendations for appropriateprotective measures. This information should be useful to you as the employerresponsible for designing protective programs, as well as to the workers.If you are not familiar with material safety data sheets and with chemicalterminology, you may need to learn to use them yourself. A glossary ofMSDS terms may be helpful in this regard. Generally speaking, most employersusing hazardous chemicals will primarily be concerned with MSDS informationregarding hazardous effects and recommended protective measures. Focuson the sections of the MSDS that are applicable to your situation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">MSDSs must be readily accessible to employees when they are in theirwork areas during their workshifts. This may be accomplished in many differentways. You must decide what is appropriate for your particular workplace.Some employers keep the MSDSs in a binder in a central location (<T3>e.g., </T3>in the pick-up truck on a construction site). Others, particularlyin workplaces with large numbers of chemicals, computerize the informationand provide access through terminals. As long as employees can get theinformation when they need it, any approach may be used. The employeesmust have access to the MSDSs themselves_simply having a system where theinformation can be read to them over the phone is only permitted underthe mobile worksite provision, paragraph (g)(9), when employees must travelbetween workplaces during the shift. In this situation, they have accessto the MSDSs prior to leaving the primary worksite, and when they return,so the telephone system is simply an emergency arrangement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to ensure that you have a current MSDS for each chemicalin the plant as required, and that employee access is provided, the complianceofficers will be looking for the following types of information in yourwritten program:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Designation of person(s) responsible for obtaining and maintainingthe MSDSs;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. How such sheets are to be maintained in the workplace (<T3>e.g., </T3>in notebooks in the work area(s) or in a computer with terminalaccess), and how employees can obtain access to them when they are in theirwork area during the work shift;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Procedures to follow when the MSDS is not received at the timeof the first shipment;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. For producers, procedures to update the MSDS when new and significanthealth information is found; and,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Description of alternatives to actual data sheets in the workplace,if used.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For employers using hazardous chemicals, the most important aspectof the written program in terms of MSDSs is to ensure that someone is responsiblefor obtaining and maintaining the MSDSs for every hazardous chemical inthe workplace. The list of hazardous chemicals required to be maintainedas part of the written program will serve as an inventory. As new chemicalsare purchased, the list should be updated. Many companies have found itconvenient to include on their purchase orders the name and address ofthe person designated in their company to receive MSDSs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">C. Employee Information and Training</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each employee who may be ``exposed'' to hazardous chemicals when workingmust be provided information and trained prior to initial assignment towork with a hazardous chemical, and whenever the hazard changes. ``Exposure''or ``exposed'' under the rule means that ``an employee is subjected toa hazardous chemical in the course of employment through any route of entry(inhalation, ingestion, skin contact or absorption, etc.) and includespotential (<T3>e.g., </T3>accidental or possible) exposure.'' <T3>See </T3>paragraph (h) of the standard for specific requirements. Informationand training may be done either by individual chemical, or by categoriesof hazards (such as flammability or carcinogenicity). If there are onlya few chemicals in the workplace, then you may want to discuss each oneindividually. Where there are large numbers of chemicals, or the chemicalschange frequently, you will probably want to train generally based on thehazard categories (<T3>e.g., </T3>flammable liquids, corrosive materials, carcinogens). Employeeswill have access to the substance-specific information on the labels andMSDSs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Information and training is a critical part of the hazard communicationprogram. Information regarding hazards and protective measures are providedto workers through written labels and material safety data sheets. However,through effective information and training, workers will learn to readand understand such information, determine how it can be obtained and usedin their own workplaces, and understand the risks of exposure to the chemicalsin their workplaces as well as the ways to protect themselves. A properlyconducted training program will ensure comprehension and understanding.It is not sufficient to either just read material to the workers, or simplyhand them material to read. You want to create a climate where workersfeel free to ask questions. This will help you to ensure that the informationis understood. You must always remember that the underlying purpose ofthe HCS is to reduce the incidence of chemical source illnesses and injuries.This will be accomplished by modifying behavior through the provision ofhazard information and information about protective measures. If your programworks, you and your workers will better understand the chemical hazardswithin the workplace. The procedures you establish regarding, for example,purchasing, storage, and handling of these chemicals will improve, andthereby reduce the risks posed to employees exposed to the chemical hazardsinvolved. Furthermore, your workers' comprehension will also be increased,and proper work practices will be followed in your workplace.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If you are going to do the training yourself, you will have to understandthe material and be prepared to motivate the workers to learn. This isnot always an easy task, but the benefits are worth the effort. More informationregarding appropriate training can be found in OSHA Publication No. 2254which contains voluntary training guidelines prepared by OSHA's TrainingInstitute. A copy of this document is available from OSHA's PublicationsOffice at (202) 523-9667.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In reviewing your written program with regard to information and training,the following items need to be considered:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Designation of person(s) responsible for conducting training;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Format of the program to be used (audiovisuals, classroom instruction,etc.);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Elements of the training program (should be consistent with theelements in paragraph (h) of the HCS); and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Procedure to train new employees at the time of their initial assignmentto work with a hazardous chemical, and to train employees when a new hazardis introduced into the workplace.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The written program should provide enough details about the employer'splans in this area to assess whether or not a good faith effort is beingmade to train employees. OSHA does not expect that every worker will beable to recite all of the information about each chemical in the workplace.In general, the most important aspects of training under the HCS are toensure that employees are aware that they are exposed to hazardous chemicals,that they know how to read and use labels and material safety data sheets,and that, as a consequence of learning this information, they are followingthe appropriate protective measures established by the employer. OSHA complianceofficers will be talking to employees to determine if they have receivedtraining, if they know they are exposed to hazardous chemicals, and ifthey know where to obtain substance-specific information on labels andMSDSs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The rule does not require employers to maintain records of employeetraining, but many employers choose to do so. This may help you monitoryour own program to ensure that all employees are appropriately trained.If you already have a training program, you may simply have to supplementit with whatever additional information is required under the HCS. Forexample, construction employers that are already in compliance with theconstruction training standard (29 CFR 1926.21) will have little extratraining to do.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An employer can provide employees information and training throughwhatever means found appropriate and protective. Although there would alwayshave to be some training on-site (such as informing employees of the locationand availability of the written program and MSDSs), employee training maybe satisfied in part by general training about the requirements of theHCS and about chemical hazards on the job which is provided by, for example,trade associations, unions, colleges, and professional schools. In addition,previous training, education and experience of a worker may relieve theemployer of some of the burdens of informing and training that worker.Regardless of the method relied upon, however, the employer is always ultimatelyresponsible for ensuring that employees are adequately trained. If thecompliance officer finds that the training is deficient, the employer willbe cited for the deficiency regardless of who actually provided the trainingon behalf of the employer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">D. Other Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to these specific items, compliance officers will alsobe asking the following questions in assessing the adequacy of the program:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Does a list of the hazardous chemicals exist in each work area orat a central location?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Are methods the employer will use to inform employees of the hazardsof non-routine tasks outlined?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Are employees informed of the hazards associated with chemicals containedin unlabeled pipes in their work areas?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On multi-employer worksites, has the employer provided other employerswith information about labeling systems and precautionary measures wherethe other employers have employees exposed to the initial employer's chemicals?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Is the written program made available to employees and their designatedrepresentatives?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If your program adequately addresses the means of communicating informationto employees in your workplace, and provides answers to the basic questionsoutlined above, it will be found to be in compliance with the rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">5. Checklist for Compliance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The following checklist will help to ensure you are in compliancewith the rule:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,4</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Obtained a copy of the rule<D/><T2>XX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Read and understood the requirements<D/><T2>XX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Assigned responsibility for tasks<D/><T2>XX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Prepared an inventory of chemicals<D/><T2>XX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ensured containers are labeled<D/><T2>XX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Obtained MSDS for each chemical<D/><T2>XX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Prepared written program<D/><T2>XX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Made MSDSs available to workers<D/><T2>XX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Conducted training of workers<D/><T2>XX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Established procedures to maintain current program<D/><T2>XX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Established procedures to evaluate effectiveness<D/><T2>XX</T2></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">6. Further Assistance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If you have a question regarding compliance with the HCS, you shouldcontact your local OSHA Area Office for assistance. In addition, each OSHARegional Office has a Hazard Communication Coordinator who can answer yourquestions. Free consultation services are also available to assist employers,and information regarding these services can be obtained through the Areaand Regional offices as well.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The telephone number for the OSHA office closest to you should belisted in your local telephone directory.
