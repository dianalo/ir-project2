<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-89-0822 </DOCNO><TEXT>In Finland the price ratios of electricity and fossil fuels, especiallyelectricity and light fuel oil, showed up to the end of 1985 very promisingprospects for thermal energy production for larger buildings and industrialprocesses by 'bivalent heating techniques'. The deep price drop in crudeoil at the beginning of 1986 changed the situation quite drastically,but the grounds have remained the same. That means that occasionallythe marginal electricity production costs are substantially lower thanthe oil price. Primary reasons for this are the facts that, on one hand,50-55% of the total electricity demand is generated with hydro and nuclearpower, which have low operating costs, and, on the other hand, by largeseasonal and daily consumption fluctuations. In order to study the energyeconomical significance of different forms of bivalent use of electricityand fuels, a computing method has been developed in the state-owned powercompany Imatran Voima Oy. In practice, an optimization procedure is implementedinto a capacity planning model named Kapas 6, which is ultimately usedin the calculation of the production costs in the Finnish power generationsystem.</TEXT></DOC>
