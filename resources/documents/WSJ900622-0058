Roy E. Disney and the principals of his private investmentvehicle, Shamrock Holdings Inc., are hoping to do just thatwith a $450 million partnership, Trefoil Capital InvestorsL.P. (Trefoil is French for shamrock).</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Disney, vice chairman of Walt Disney Co. and Walt'snephew, joins the growing ranks of so-called &quot;white squires&quot;trying to profit from rescuing companies whose appetite fordebt in the 1980s is devouring them in the '90s. The venture,which stopped soliciting new funds and closed the partnershiplast month, has already attempted bail-out deals withSouthland Corp. and Ames Department Stores Inc., people closeto those talks say. Those transactions didn't materialize.   The partnership intends to do &quot;two or three deals,&quot; saysStanley P. Gold, Shamrock's president and chief executiveofficer and its chief strategist. The transactions would markthe first major deals for the Shamrock principals since theirfailed run at Polaroid Corp. two years ago.   Mr. Gold says Trefoil has &quot;a couple of candidates underthe microscope&quot; and should complete a deal by the end of theyear. Although he declines to identify candidates, he saysTrefoil would be looking at industries where Shamrock alreadyhas experience, particularly &quot;retailing, one area hard-hit bythe overleveraged situation.&quot; Shamrock owns the 71-storeMusic Plus chain of music and video stores in SouthernCalifornia and the 140-store Sound Warehouse chain in Dallas.It also owns 15 radio and three television stations, holdsabout a 15% stake in oil field equipment maker Enterra Corp.,and has various real estate holdings.   Shamrock quietly started bringing in partners for Trefoillast fall, calling on investors from its prior ventures andsoliciting new money as well. Mr. Gold won't identify any ofthe investors, except to say they include both biginstitutions and private individuals, &quot;but no pension funds.&quot;The Shamrock principals take a 1% fee for managing thepartnership.   Though the amount raised for Trefoil is shy of the $500million that Shamrock was seeking, &quot;given the environmentthat's out there, we feel very good to have been able toraise $450 million,&quot; says R. Rudolph Reinfrank, a Shamrockexecutive vice president who spearheaded the fund-raisingefforts.   The Shamrock partnership is entering an increasinglycrowded field of fund operators who specialize in offeringcash to companies in need. The new funds have taken a varietyof forms: Some, like the $1.6 billion Corporate Partnersorganized by Lazard Freres andamp; Co., buy into healthy companiesfacing a particular cash need. Ironically, Corporate Partnersbought new Polaroid securities that helped the company eludeShamrock's hostile overtures.   Other partnerships are raising money with the aim ofinvesting in distressed and even bankrupt companies. Theserestructuring funds include one with a minimum goal of $500million being organized by Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. and anotherfor $750 million headed by Chicago investors Sam Zell andDavid Shulte.   While overleveraged companies could provide manyinvestment opportunities in the 1990s, Shamrock has an edgein that it has already secured financing amid what couldbecome a glut of proposed funds. Plans for a few white squirefunds, including one by LBO specialist Theodore Forstmann,have been scrapped, and raising money for several other fundsis proving harder than expected.   Shamrock executives concede that they were drawn to theidea of establishing their own white squire fund because itmakes a kitty readily available to them when they spot atarget. &quot;It removes from us the need on a deal-by-deal basisto focus on funding,&quot; says Robert Moskowitz, a Shamrockexecutive vice president and corporate counsel.   The exact form Trefoil's investments will take will bedetermined case by case, but most will be in the $50 millionto $100 million range, for deals ranging up to $1 billion ormore in size. Trefoil might acquire companies outright, orinject capital in exchange for large stakes.   &quot;We prefer going into a situation where there's strongexisting management, and we insert new equity into thecompany,&quot; Mr. Gold says. &quot;But there's no cookie-cutterapproach.&quot; The partnership has broad powers to pursue varioustransactions, including leveraged buy-outs if the buy-outmarket rebounds. The fund can also be used for hostiletakeovers, although Mr. Gold says he doesn't plan any.   One thing Trefoil won't be is a passive investor. &quot;Wethink we have some management talent to add to theenterprise,&quot; Mr. Gold says.   Earlier this year, Trefoil had an agreement to invest&quot;several hundred million dollars&quot; in Southland, theDallas-based operator of the 7-Eleven chain, people close tothat deal say. But Southland instead opted to sell a 75%controlling interest for $400 million to the Japaneseoperators of its stores in Japan, Seven-Eleven Japan Co. andIto Yokado Co. Trefoil received a breakup fee from Southland.   Trefoil also approached Ames just prior to that retailer'sbankruptcy filing in late April, people close to Ames said.Trefoil was to have provided debtor-in-possession financingin exchange for an equity position in the company.   Mark Siegel, who heads Shamrock's media and communicationsbusinesses, says that Trefoil is unlike other squire funds inthat &quot;a lot of those investment partnerships feel a strongneed to do a certain number of transactions&quot; because of thefees generated. &quot;We want to make a good investment. If we do,everyone will profit.&quot;   Shamrock is generally credited with having a good trackrecord for investing. Mr. Disney formed the company in 1978as an investment vehicle for himself and his wife, Patty,bringing on Mr. Gold as the financial mastermind. In 1979,they bought Staar Broadcasting Group Inc. and used it as abase for Shamrock's extensive broadcasting operations. In1985, Shamrock bought Central Soya Co., turned aroundoperations and sold the company two years later at a profitof about $125 million. Though Shamrock failed to acquirePolaroid, it earned a $40 million to $50 million profit onits stock in the instant-camera maker, Mr. Gold says.   Mr. Gold and Mr. Disney also engineered the 1984 ouster offormer management at Walt Disney Co. and appointment of thecurrent team of Michael Eisner and Frank Wells, who havebrought the entertainment company quarter after quarter ofrecord earnings and allowed Mr. Disney to profit handsomelyon his stock holdings.   ---   James A.
