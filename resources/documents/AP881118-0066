(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal grand jury is investigatingallegations that a Cornell University graduate student created a``virus'' that jammed a nationwide network of university andmilitary computers, a prosecutor said.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Baxter on Thursday declined to saywhen the panel began hearing evidence or whether anyone has beensubpoenaed to testify.   ``I can say this is the only district in which a grand juryinvestigation is pending. Some evidence has been presented to thegrand jury,'' Baxter said.   Cornell student Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, is suspected ofunleashing the virus earlier this month, disrupting 6,000 computersnationwide.   Morris has told friends he didn't intend any harm.   The FBI is conducting a criminal investigation to determinewhether statutes on wire fraud, malicious mischief or unlawfulaccess to stored communications may have been broken. No chargeshave been filed.   The FBI has subpoenaed computer tapes and other records atCornell's computer science department.   Baxter declined to say whether anyone other than Morris is thetarget of the grand jury investigation in Syracuse.   A computer virus works by duplicating itself, infecting onecomputer after another as users share floppy disks or link up overtelephone lines.   The virus this month did its damage by rapidly duplicatingitself, thereby slowing computers' processing speed and taking upmemory space.</TEXT></DOC>
