MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After months of controversy and hours ofdebate, an angry congressional argument over federal art subsidiescould boil down to 30 seconds _ the standard length of a campaignad on television.   ``We live in fear of how someone could portray our vote in a30-second political ad,'' said Sen. Herbert H. Kohl, D-Wis., whononetheless voted against sweeping restrictions proposed by Sen.Jesse Helms, R-N.C., on the use of funds by the National Endowmentfor the Arts. But for the threat of election-year reprisals, Kohlsaid, Helms' proposal wouldn't have been treated as seriousbusiness.   Helms said the issue was whether taxpayers should be forced tohelp pay for dirty pictures advertised as art. His opponents saidit was censorship versus artistic freedom.   As is customary, both sides overstated the case, at great length.   ``The definition of art is an issue for the academy, not thelegislature,'' Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., had said when the issuearose last summer. The legislature proved that point. Coatssupported the Helms restrictions, saying the question was one ofcontrolling the use of tax dollars, not deciding what is or isn'tart.   But Congress did take a role in that determination 25 years ago,when the art subsidy system was created, although it delegated thejob of defining art to panels of experts in the hope it would beinsulated against politics. The arts endowment has made about85,000 grants, and only about 20 had been called into questionbefore.   The insulation broke down four months ago over a $30,000 NEAsubsidy to help finance a showing of 150 photographs by RobertMapplethorpe, among them pictures of homosexual acts and of nakedchildren. The exhibit was assembled by a Philadelphia arts groupafter Mapplethorpe died of AIDS early this year. A secondcontroversy arose over a $15,000 grant to another photographerwhose works included a picture of a crucifix in a jar of urine.   With those incitements, some congressional punishment wasinevitable. Congress voted to cut a symbolic $45,000 out of the$171 million NEA budget for next year. They set up a commission tostudy changes in the way the arts agency decides who should getsubsidies. And they voted a ban on federal aid to art that isobscene.   The latter provision will make it more difficult for thereligious right to proceed with its threat to tell voters thatmembers who voted against the sweeping Helms amendment are onrecord in support of subsidized pornography.   Helms complained last week that the system has the governmentsupport artists whose work the taxpayers won't support in themarketplace.   That's exactly what the system does. Advocates say that is whyit is needed. But this argument is not about support for starvingartists, it is over government aid to exhibits, in this casephotographs, most voters would consider at least vulgar, possiblyobscene, in any case offensive.   Nobody in Congress defended the photographs that stirred thedispute. Defenders of the NEA system called support for those worksmistakes in an operation that generally works well.   ``We fully recognize that no government can call artisticexcellence into existence,'' President Lyndon B. Johnson said whenthe agency was created. ``It must flow from the quality of thesociety and the good fortune of the nation. Nor should anygovernment seek to restrict the freedom of the artist to pursue hiscalling in his own way.''   The measure was designed to put the artistic decisions in thehands of outside experts, not government. But Sen. Claiborne Pell,D-R.I., one of the sponsors of the original act, said Johnson meantfreedom, not license.   The line between the two always has been hard to find.   Helms wanted Congress to ban arts aid to anything denigratingreligion _ or even ``nonreligion'' _ and to works deemed indecentor obscene. Those are difficult words to define, but Helms is amaster at reducing complex issues to black and white test votes.When his amendment was adopted on July 26, without a recorded vote,Helms said that any senator who wanted the government fundingpornography should vote against him.   When it was scrapped in negotiations with the House, Helmsrevived the issue last Thursday night and forced it to a roll call.``All I wanted was for the senators to look at the pictures andthen vote as they please and then answer to the folks back home,''he said.   ``... Some day, if you vote against this amendment,'' said Sen.Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., who did, ``... somebody is going to runthat 30-second ad and say `Senator So-and-so supports pornography,Senator So-and-so wants your tax dollars spent on pornography...''   Helms' amendment was defeated 62 to 35, and a morning-afterversion was revised into the obscenity ban.   That leaves an issue and sends a message. From now on, thepanels that decide who gets federal arts subsidies are likely to dotheir erring on the side of caution.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
