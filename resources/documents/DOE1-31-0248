Impurityintroduction is simulated by changing the atomic radius of the impurityin comparison with the atomic radius, R/sub 0/, of the matrix. It isshown that with the impurity radius more than 1.18 R/sub 0/ the impurity-divacancycomplex transforms into the splitting configuration, in which the impurityatom is in the middle between two vacancies. This complex can becomean effective centre of point defect recombination, when possessing lightmobility and a large radius of capture.</TEXT></DOC>
