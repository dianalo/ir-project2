Police said otherinsurgents moved deeper into the territory.   Nine U.N. assembly points were set up Tuesday in an effort tomove guerrillas who had infiltrated into Namibia back toneighboring Angola. They had used bases in Angola while trying tooust South Africa from the territory. The latest fighting broke outApril 1, the first day of a year-long process to make Namibiaindependent.   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the guerrillas on Wednesdayattacked South Africa with words, accusing it and the United Statesof hiding advance knowledge of the infiltration in a bid to justifyan attack on the insurgents.   ``This was a premeditated and orchestrated ambush, for SouthAfrica to find the pretext to jump out of the commitment'' tocooperate with the U.N. independence plan, said Theo-Ben Gurirab,foreign secretary of the South West Africa People's Organization,known as SWAPO.   Gurirab said South Africa had advance knowledge of theinfiltration through U.S. aerial reconnaissance photographs. Hesaid the South Africans contrived the situation to persuade BritishPrime MInister Margaret Thatcher, who was visiting Namibia on April1, that SWAPO had broken the cease-fire agreement.   U.S. and South African officials had no immediate response.   Gurirab said SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma had ordered the guerrillasinto Namibia to surrender to U.N. officials and move into camps.However, no U.N. military observers were in northern Namibia at thetime.   South Africa says about 1,900 guerrillas infiltrated intonorthern Namibia starting April 1. U.N. investigators agree theguerrillas violated a peace accord requiring they stay in Angolanbases at least until May 15, when they could enter the country asunarmed refugees.   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I. Last December,it agreed to begin a transition to independence in exchange forCuba withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.   No major skirmishes have been reported in Namibia, also known asSouth-West Africa, since the weekend. Police say 263 guerrillas and27 security force members were killed during the recent fighting.   The four guerrillas arrived Wednesday at a U.N. checkpoint at aLutheran church in the northern town of Oniipa, according to anAssociated Press photographer at the scene. Two had arm wounds.   U.N. personnel were called in and took the men to a U.N. camp 38miles away at Oshikango border. U.N. soldiers helped the woundedguerrillas from the truck at Oshikango and placed them in a tentwhile plans were made to send them across the border to their basesin Angola.   Nujoma last weekend called on his guerrillas to withdraw fromNamibia, and the United Nations and the security forces agreed toarrange assembly points and provide safe passage to Angola.   Officials in the security forces said they saw tracks of someSWAPO guerrillas heading into Angola, but there were no reports ofguerrillas arriving at the U.N. checkpoints until the four onWednesday.   Security force members and SWAPO supporters have predicted thatfew guerrillas will report to the U.N. checkpoints because of thedeployment of security forces there, the proximity of militarybases, and poor communication between guerrilla commanders andtheir forces.   Police said some guerrillas might try to cross back into Angolawithout reporting to the checkpoints and others might hide theirweapons, don civilian clothes and try to stay in Namibia.   A police spokesman, Chief Inspector Derrick Brune, said somegroups of insurgents were seen Wednesday moving south away from theAngola border.   So far, only 1,721 of 4,650 U.N. peacekeepers have reached theterritory.</TEXT></DOC>
