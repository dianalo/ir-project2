With a partner, and a loan from his brother, a truck-stopoperator in St. Louis, Mr. Manning co-founded Zoom in 1977.The hand-held &quot;Demon Dialer&quot; was unveiled in 1981, and annualsales shot to $6 million by 1984. &quot;We were euphoric,&quot; Mr.Manning says.</LP><TEXT>   But within a year, Zoom was on the ropes. Regulatorschanged the way long-distance telephone customers reachedcarriers like MCI and Sprint, eliminating the need to dial along string of digits before a call. Zoom's lucrative specialniche quickly disappeared -- along with nearly three-quartersof its sales volume.   Now Zoom is flying high again. Its comeback shows howsmall companies in narrow markets must be prepared toreinvent themselves -- sometimes more than once. While bigcompanies commonly have a range of products, small concernsare often vulnerable because their fortunes ride on a singleproduct line. Zoom is thriving in a new market, but it isalready preparing for the day when it must find somethingelse.   &quot;With all we've been through, we don't take anything forgranted anymore,&quot; Mr. Manning says. He says that smallcompanies, especially those in fast-changing technologymarkets, &quot;have to be able to see new openings, and dashthrough them before they close.&quot;   After overcoming Zoom's earlier problems, he adds, &quot;ourmanagement team isn't just well seasoned, it's charbroiled.&quot;   Zoom switched to producing modems, which convert computerdata to sound for transmission over phone lines. Yesterday,Zoom said first-quarter profit jumped 50%, continuing astring of strong quarters. The quarter's net was $427,615, oreight cents a share, on sales of $4 million, compared withyear-earlier results of $284,500, or five cents a share, onsales of $2.7 million. Mr. Manning predicts that 1991 saleswill hit $20 million.   Despite its drastic change of product line, the companyhas stuck to many of its basic methods and its focus onholding down costs. Chastened by its near-collapse in 1985,Zoom has kept its payroll small and still operates from a fewcramped floors of an old brick building in downtown Boston,above an art gallery and rib joint. A sweet hickory smokepermeates the company's offices as young, casually dressedworkers hustle to fill orders or design new products. Mr.Manning, the president, still shares his small office withhis vice president and co-founder. It is ankle-deep in pastmarketing campaigns, electrical design debris and oldsneakers.   Zoom's 50 employees -- the same number the company had atthe peak of its first boom -- generate three times the annualsales of that period.   At its nadir, Zoom got help from a state venture-capitalfund, the Massachusetts Technology Development Corp., whichinvested $200,000 in Zoom in 1985 -- and another $100,000 in1987 when Zoom's planned public offering was delayed by themarket crash. &quot;They saved us,&quot; Mr. Manning says. And theymade money in the process: the state-backed fund, which stillowns some shares, says it expects to get a $1 million returnon its investment. &quot;This was a winner for us,&quot; says Robert J.Crowley, the fund's executive director. Mr. Manning &quot;is therare entrepreneur who can see the emerging markets and beready to jump in at just the right time,&quot; Mr. Crowley says.   Zoom says it now has between 8% to 10% of shipments in thedial-up personal computer modem market, where more than 20companies compete for business.   &quot;It's a real snake pit of competition,&quot; says M. RonaldOpel, an analyst with Fechtor Detwiler andamp; Co. in Boston. Heapplauds Zoom's strategy of pricing well below the umbrellaset by market leader Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. andbuilding in such popular features as fax capability. He alsosays Zoom has managed to keep its assembly costs low withoutgoing outside the U.S. Zoom keeps its inventory tight, runs alean operation and contracts out some work.   Zoom got another boost last month when PC Magazine awardeda new product its &quot;Editor's Choice&quot; award. The magazine citedZoom's 9600-bps modem for its &quot;speed, features and flawlessperformance.&quot;   Mr. Manning is convinced modems will provide growingrevenues for years to come, as buyers demand new features andfaster speeds.   But others aren't so sure. International Data Corp. seesZoom's largest current market segment beginning to shrink in1992. While Zoom is already moving into more powerful modems,it must constantly boost the power and performance of itsproducts just to keep pace. At the same time, the long-termoutlook is uncertain: if telephone transmission lines becomefully digital, as planned, modems will go out of style asfast as the Demon Dialer disappeared years ago. (Computersprocess data as digital information, so digital transmissionlines wouldn't require the signal translation provided by amodem.)   Other threats to Zoom's niche are more immediate. Somecomputer makers are beginning to install modems into theirmachines at the factory, as International Business MachinesCorp. did recently with its PS/1 home computer, drainingsales from independents like Zoom.   So, Zoom is hedging its bets. It is building a voicesynthesizer circuit board, designed for use with personalcomputers and inside corporate voice-mail systems. And it isdesigning an interface device, called an ISDN adapter, forthe day when personal computers don't need modems to send andreceive data over the phone.   &quot;If we woke up tomorrow and discovered that the world hasgone digital, there'd still be 160 million phone jacks thatneed to have new circuits installed to connect to computers,&quot;Mr. Manning says.   &quot;We'll be happy to supply them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
