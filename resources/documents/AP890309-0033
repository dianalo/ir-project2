But the guerrillas, in a communique, said they may resumediscussions with political leaders after the vote and that theyfavor participation in the election by the leftist political frontwith which they maintain links.   The rebel announcement Wednesday put at least a temporary end tothe peace process they initiated Jan. 24 by offering to take part inthe vote and respect its outcome if it were postponed to Septemberand their security and anti-fraud concerns addressed.   The Christian Democratic government of President Jose NapoleonDuarte had failed to arrange talks with the rebel Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front to consider the plan.   The opposition rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance, whichcontrols the legislature and is favored to win the presidency,vigorously objected to any election delay.   Noting that the government took more than a month to respond tothe proposal, the rebel communique said that time had run out.   ``In these conditions of so much delay and deceit ... theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front declares that it maintainsits offer of peace and will continue to struggle for it. But itconsiders that holding a meeting now with the government .. . wouldbe to lend ourselves to further deceit of our people and of worldopinion,'' the communique said.   ``Only after the election, which will be fraudulent, could therebe another attempt to negotiate peace among the (rebels), thegovernment, the Legislative Assembly and the political parties,''said the communique, which was called in to a local radio station.   ``The (front) calls on the masses to combatively repudiate thisfraudulent election,'' it said. The guerrillas have repudiated thefive previous national elections held this decade.   The rebel communique approved participation in the election bythe Democratic Convergence, the political front that maintains linkswith the guerrillas. It said guerrilla combatants ``consider thatthe Convergence's participation in the elections, at a disadvantageand against fraud, is intended to help clear the path toward peace.''   An estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have died inthe 9-year-old civil war between the Marxist-led guerrillas and theU.S.-supported government.</TEXT></DOC>
