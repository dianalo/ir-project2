Second-quarter poultry prices soared an annualized 30%, government data say. That's about a 7% hike from the first quarter. Fish, until recently the pricier entree, stabilized, gaining only 1.1%. &quot;Demand is very high for chicken, and some of the effects of higher feed prices are still carrying over,&quot; says Frank Pankyo of the Food Institute. (About 70% of the cost of chicken is feed.) Fast-food firms' major push into chicken items swells demand, he adds.    But McDonald's says don't blame the McChicken sandwich. The chain's poultry costs haven't changed since March, thanks to &quot;vertically integrated suppliers.&quot; Translating from McSpeak: McDonald's eyes its future needs and orders poultry (a lot) well in advance so suppliers can better control their costs. But not every user can create its own supply and demand. Prudential-Bache analyst Leslie Steppel says the average Kentucky Fried unit sees a 4% to 5% sales drop after raising prices at a time when the non-chicken competition is discounting menus.    But Tom Thumb supermarkets and others say shoppers don't squawk at higher poultry and egg prices.    THE PLAY'S THE THING, but just try getting it read, much less produced.    Playwriting competitions draw more interest, although production is still elusive. Theatre Communications Group, publisher of Dramatists Sourcebook (the contest bible), raised the printing on the 1989-90 edition to 5,200 copies after last year's run of 4,200 books sold out. Two contests that pay off partly in production are big draws: the Eugene O'Neill Center's National Playwrights Conference (1,200 entries) and the Young Playwrights Festival (800 entrants aged eight to 18). Some specify themes, such as life in Hawaii or the South.    The Dramatists Guild notes that the very act of writing a play copyrights the work. But if a fight arises, &quot;you can't sue under federal copyright laws unless you have a registration number&quot; from the U.S. Copyright Office, says the guild's Dana Singer. David Johnson, editor of Show Business, notes that many authors gravitate toward film and TV. &quot;But everyone who is a writer has a dream of having a play produced.&quot;    Sandamp;L SALVAGE gets murkier for those seeking takeovers, workouts, investments.    Investment banks initially zoomed in on the troubled thrifts, often bunching them for resale in partnerships. But the enthusiasm may cool since the bailout act calls for bank holding companies to indemnify the FDIC from failures by sister banks. Salomon Brothers analyst Bruce Harting calls much of the buying of thrift stocks &quot;indiscriminate.&quot; And banks -- strapped for cash themselves -- are likely to offer securities instead of dollars in the takeovers. Initial public offerings by mutual thrifts (and secondary issues of public ones) are expected to be rare.    Healthy Sandamp;Ls mull switching to state from federal charters to avoid losing dividends from their stock in the 10 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Under the bailout, the federal government gobbles up the payouts. But a state-chartered thrift could sell the stock. &quot;We don't want to have to pay the price to bail out a bankrupt system,&quot; says Jack Morgan, chairman of American Savings Bank, which is switching charters.    Paine Webber and Essex Financial confirm plans for a fund to buy healthy Southeast Sandamp;Ls. Goal: $75 million.    COMMA COPS say slow down: Fewer are probably better. Grammar Group, a Chicago firm that picks up where your third-grade teacher left off, says the misplaced comma is the most common error in business writing. For $5,000 a course, it instructs on commas and other fine points. Pupils include Ford, Chrysler, GM, Harris Bank.    SMOKING MAY BE HAZARDOUS to your job prospects. A survey by Robert Half International finds that one in four smokers will be rejected when competing with an equally qualified non-smoker for a post.    THE FIFTH ONE'S FREE at DePauw University. It offers outstanding graduates a tuition-free year to broaden their liberal arts background. The first recipient: Joseph Webster Jr., a Phi Beta Kappa chemistry grad who plans to take courses this fall in art, religion, music and political science.    DISTRUST COSTS minority suppliers and their mainstream customers.    Goods from minority vendors are more expensive partly because they have to prove themselves more, do their own costly research, and process bundles of red tape, says a report from Indiana University's School of Business and purchasing groups. The study lists &quot;atmosphere&quot; as one of the major problems cited by both vendors and buyers. &quot;That's a euphemism for cultural or racial 'uncomfortableness,'&quot; says the school's Marc J. Dollinger, study creator.    The report says minority suppliers often feel a &quot;sense of powerlessness&quot; -- possibly from &quot;dealing with an apparently hostile environment.&quot; And buyers sometimes blame poor supplier practices on race rather than on the haphazard way many small businesses sometimes operate. But some minority vendors add to the mistrust by keeping mum about temporary problems.    Minority vendors who strike out on their own after working at a corporation find the most success, the groups say.    BRIEFS: The Old Homestead in New York plans to serve Japanese Kobe beef at $75 per steak. . . . The pharmacist may be at lunch, but the computer never noshes: Care/Quest and Columbia School of Public Health will offer drugstores computers that can answer common health questions. </TEXT></DOC>
