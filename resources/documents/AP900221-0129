(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA today delayed the launch of thespace shuttle Atlantis' secret military mission for at least 24hours because of the commander's health and weather conditions.   A brief statement said the commander, Navy Capt. John O.Creighton, had ``developed an upper respiratory tract infection. Inaddition, the launch weather is not predicted to be favorable.''   NASA said it would decide Thursday whether to try the launch atthe Kennedy Space Center on Friday.   The space agency said a cold front was expected to move throughthe area tonight, bringing with it clouds, rain and high winds atthe expected early Thursday launch time.   The weather forecast had improved during the day, with the oddsfor launch increasing from 30 to 50 percent. But that was notacceptable, and shuttle managers decided to call off the flight inearly afternoon before technicians began pumping half a milliongallons of propellant into Atlantis' fuel tank.   Officials had been anxious to launch Atlantis on Thursdaybecause long-range forecasts call for even worse conditions Fridayand Saturday.   Early today, a service structure which provides workers accessto the space shuttle as it sits on the launch pad was rotated awayfrom Atlantis and parked to one side.   ``They wouldn't do that if they had a problem,'' said NASAspokesman Bruce Buckingham.   Atlantis astronauts took advantage of a slight break in theweather today to fly practice landings in the space shuttletraining craft. They spent the rest of he morning in briefings andwent to bed at noon.   The early bedtime for the five-member shuttle crew is designedto shift their sleep cycle to the rest schedule they'll follow inorbit.   In addition to Creighton, Atlantis' crew includes the pilot, AirForce Col. John H. Casper and mission specialists Marine Lt. Col.David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Lt.Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.   Because of Atlantis' classified military cargo, NASA officialsdid not announce the precise launch time, saying only that it wouldcome between midnight and 4 a.m. Thursday.   The mission is the sixth of 34 shuttle flights to be dedicatedto a classified, military cargo.   Once Atlantis is in orbit, communications to the space shuttlewill be blacked out to the public until just an hour before thecraft returns to Earth. The flight is expected to last four days.   According to sources, Atlantis' payload is a 37,300-pound, $500million spy satellite known by the code name AFP-731.   The device is said to be able to take high-resolutionreconnaissance photos and to listen in on military and diplomaticcommunications around the world.   Placed into a high inclination orbit, the spy satellite willpass over most of the Soviet Union, including northern areas notpreviously probed by shuttle-launched satellites. This orbit may beimportant in verifying Soviet compliance with disarmamentagreements now being negotiated between the U.S. and the SovietUnion.   The Soviets have spy satellites of their own to assure U.S.compliance.</TEXT></DOC>
