The two administration defeats came on the opening day ofvotes on amendments to a Treasury plan to rewrite bankinglaws. But both setbacks were tempered by circumstancessomewhat favorable to the Treasury. The administration'sproposal to limit deposit insurance on multiple bank accountsheld by one person fell by only a one-vote margin, meaningthat the administration may be able to collect enough votesto win at a later stage.</LP><TEXT>   And the House Financial Institutions Subcommittee did voteto limit the issuance of federally insured &quot;brokereddeposits&quot; to only the strongest banks. Still, the vote was abig victory for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and the SecuritiesIndustry Association, which had worked hard to defeat theadministration's proposal. Merrill Lynch is a majorparticipant in the $80-billion brokered deposit market.   The initial votes were on Treasury proposals to shrink thefederal deposit insurance safety net, not by reducing the$100,000 ceiling on insured deposits but by limiting thenumber of accounts that qualify for insurance. TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady went to Capitol Hill to rallyRepublican support for the Treasury proposals, but theadministration couldn't hold enough GOP votes to prevail ontwo of the three major issues the panel took up.   The subcommittee did adopt Treasury proposals to stop&quot;pass-through insurance&quot; of professionally managed pensionfunds held for individuals by banks. A victory for theinsurance industry, the change, if it survives the longlegislative process, would make it more difficult for banksto compete with insurance companies for pension planbusiness.   The committee voted to end insurance coverage of bankinvestment contracts, which are giant certificates of depositthat banks sell to pension plans. These so-called BICsqualify for insurance because they are pro rated in units of$100,000 or less for each pension plan participant. Theycompete directly with guaranteed investment contracts, orGICs, which are uninsured, fixed-return products sold byinsurance companies. BICs have been one of the bankingindustry's fastest growing products, rising to about $20billion today from $300 million in 1987 during a period inwhich some insurance companies have had difficulties withGICs.   The most contested issue before the panel was theTreasury's proposal to limit the number of insured accountsto two per bank per person. Rep. Carroll Hubbard (D., Ky.)introduced an amendment to maintain the status quo, whichallows an individual to hold several insured accounts in abank. His amendment passed on an 18-17 vote, with five of thepanel's 14 Republicans voting against the Treasury.   &quot;If this amendment fails, it will create confusion andanxiety among depositors&quot; at a time when many are worriedabout the soundness of the banking system, Mr. Hubbardargued. He had strong support from the Independent BankersAssociation, which represents community banks around thecountry. Many community bankers had warned members ofCongress that the Treasury proposal would cause largedepositors to move their funds from small banks to banksassumed to be so large that the government won't let themfail.   A broad coalition, including the American BankersAssociation, the American Association of Retired Persons, theNational Association of Homebuilders and the National FarmersUnion, also opposed the Treasury proposal.   Only about 2% of the nation's depositors have multipleaccounts in one bank, but their accounts hold 28% of thenation's bank deposits. Many subcommittee members, Democratsas well as Republicans, argued that deposit insurance hadbeen stretched too far to protect the wealthy.   A similar argument prevailed when the panel voted to stoppass-through insurance of pension funds in banks. Severalmembers contended that covering professionally managed fundsdistorts an insurance program designed to protect individualsavers. Banks, joined by labor, are sure to fight to restorepass-through protection. Currently, about $88 billion ofpension fund assets, including some $20 billion of BICs, areheld in insured bank accounts.   Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.) won support for an amendmentthat would continue to provide insurance for individualcontributions made to so-called Section 427 pension plans byemployees of state and local governments and non-profitorganizations.   The decision to continue insurance coverage for brokereddeposits up to $100,000 was a compromise that built on a 1989law that prevents weak financial institutions from fundingtheir lending operations with money raised by selling CDsthrough brokers. As adopted by the subcommittee, onlywell-capitalized banks will be able to sell insured CDsthrough brokers like Merrill Lynch. Because well-capitalizedbanks aren't likely to fail, the compromise lowers the riskto the deposit insurance fund.   When the subcomittee reconvenes tomorrow it will face sometwo dozen amendments relating to deposit insurance. Then itwill start work on an even more controversial part of theTreasury's bill: proposals to allow banks to affiliate withsecurities and insurance firms, and to be owned by industrialcompanies. Yesterday the Independent Insurance Agents ofAmerica and the Financial Services Council, which representscompanies with interests in banking, securities, insuranceand industry, were putting the finishing touches on acompromise designed to prevent a confrontation betweeninsurance agents and the Treasury.</TEXT></DOC>
