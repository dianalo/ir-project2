This petition is filed on behalfof the U.S. industry producing limousines. In compliance with the filingrequirements of section 355.12 of the Commerce Regulations (19 CFR 355.12),the petition alleges that producers and exporters of limousines in Canadareceive subsidies within the meaning of section 701 of the Tariff Act of1930, as amended (the Act).Since Canada is a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning ofsection 701(b) of the Act, title VII of the Act applies to this investigation,and the ITC is required to determine whether imports of the subject merchandisefrom Canada materially injure, or threaten material injury to, the U.S.industry.Petitioner has alleged that it has standing to file the petition. Specifically,petitioner has alleged that it is an interested party as defined undersection 771(9)(C) of the Act and that it has filed the petition on behalfof the U.S. industry producing the products that are subject to this investigation.If any interested party as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or(F) of section 771(9) of the Act wishes to register support of or oppositionto this petition, please file written notification with the Commerce officialscited in the <T2>``For Further Information Contact'' </T2>section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initiation of Investigation</ITAG>Under section 702(c) of the Act, we must make the determination on whetherto initiate a countervailing duty proceeding within 20 days after a petitionis filed. Section 702(b) of the Act requires the Department to initiatea countervailing duty proceeding whenever an interested party files a petition,on behalf of an industry, that (1) alleges the elements necessary for theimposition of a duty under section 701(a), and (2) is accompanied by informationreasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations. We haveexamined the petition on limousines from Canada and have found that mostof the programs alleged in the petition meet these requirements. Therefore,we are initiating a countervailing duty investigation to determine whetherCanadian producers or exporters of limousines, as described in the ``Scopeof Investigation'' section of this notice, receive subsidies. However,we are not initiating an investigation for certain programs because thepetition failed to allege the elements necessary for the imposition ofa duty or in some instances failed to provide the necessary supportinginformation. If our investigation proceeds normally, we will make our preliminarydetermination on or before October 17, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the HarmonizedTariff Schedule (HTS), as provided for in section 1201 <T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption onor after this date will be classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s). The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience andU.S. Customs Service purposes. The written description remains dispositive.The product covered by this investigation is limousines, which are definedas extended wheelbase and expanded seating capacity motor vehicles principallydesigned for the transport of persons, of a cylinder capacity exceeding1,500 cubic centimeters, and having spark-ignition internal combustionreciprocating piston engines of six or more cylinders (gasoline-enginepowered). The vehicles are built on Lincoln Town Car, Mercury Grand Marquis,Cadillac Brougham or any other six or eight cylinder gasoline engine poweredchassis. The vehicle is cut in half and the wheelbase is extended, therebyproviding additional rear seating capacity, area and comforts. The sheetmetal work is formed to complement the original design of the base car.The vehicles are used by private individuals, corporations and limousineservices. Limousines are currently provided for under the following HTSsubheadings: 8703.23.00.75, 8703.24.00.75 and 9802.00.50.40. Prior to January1, 1989, limousines were classifiable under items 806.2040, 692.1015 and692.1030 of the <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA).</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Allegations of Subsidies</ITAG>Petitioner lists a number of practices by the Government of Canada andthe provincial governments of Ontario and Quebec which allegedly confersubsidies on producers or exporters of limousines. We are initiating aninvestigation of the following programs:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) over and above the basic rateof seven percent</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Regional Development Incentive Program (RDIP) and Industrialand Regional Development Program IRDP)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Loans under the Enterprise Development Program (EDP)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Promotional Projects Program (PPP)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Program for Export Market Development (PEMD)</ITAG>We are not initiating an investigation of the programs listed below. Section702(b) of the Act requires the Department to initiate a countervailingduty proceeding whenever an interested party files a petition on behalfof an industry that (1) alleges the elements necessary for the impositionof a duty under section 701(a), and (2) is accompanied by information reasonablyavailable to the petitioner supporting the allegations. All the programslisted below were alleged to confer domestic subsidies. The elements whichmust be alleged for a domestic subsidy program are (1) specificity (<T3>i.e., </T3>the program is limited to a specific enterprise or industryor group of enterprises or industries), and (2) provision of a countervailablebenefit (<T3>i.e., </T3>a subsidy paid or bestowed directly or indirectly on themanufacturer, producer or exporter of any class or kind of merchandise).For upstream subsidies, the initiation threshold is higher. Under section701(e) of the Act, the Department must have reasonable grounds to believeor suspect that an upstream subsidy, as defined in section 771A of theAct, is being paid or bestowed upon merchandise under investigation. Forthe programs listed below, the requirements of section 702(b) or 701(e)of the Act were not fulfilled in the petition.1. Provision of Subsidized Electric Energy by Hydro-QuebecPetitioner alleges that a countervailable benefit is conferred on CanadianLimousine Manufacturers in the form of low-cost electric energy. Specifically,petitioner alleges that Hydro-Quebec, a provincially-owned power company,is being subsidized and that the subsidy passes through the limousine manufacturer'ssupplier of electricity, Ontario Hydro, to limousine manufacturers. Undersection 701(e) of the Act, whenever the Department has reasonable groundsto believe or suspect that an upsteam subsidy is being paid or bestowed,the Department must investigate whether an upstream subsidy has in factbeen paid or bestowed. The provisions of section 771A(a) of the Act definean upstream subsidy as:<ITAG tagnum="71">Any subsidy described in section 771(5)(B)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv)by the government of a country that_(1) is paid or bestowed by that governmentwith respect to a product (hereinafter referred to as an ``input product'')that is used in the manufacture or production in that country of merchandisewhich is the subject of a countervailing duty proceeding; (2) in the judgmentof the administering authority bestows a competitive benefit on the merchandise;and (3) has a significant effect on the cost of manufacturing or producingthe merchandise.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Because pettioner has not made a formal upstream subsidy allegationcovering each of the elements listed above, we are not initiating on thisprogram.2. Other Investment Tax CreditsPetitioner alleges that a variety of investment tax credits provide a benefitto producers or exporters of limousines in Canada. As noted above, we areinitiating an investigation on additional tax credits over and above thebasic rate of seven percent, which are tied to certain regions of Canada.However, we are not initiating an investigation on the basic rate for investmentin ``qualified property,'' ``certified property,'' and transportation andconstruction equipment. Petitioner argues that we must make a determinationof whether the basic rate is limited to specific industries on a <T3>de facto </T3>basis. In <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain FreshAtlantic Groundfish from Canada </T3>(51 FR 10041, March 24, 1986) (<T3>Groundfish</T3>), we determined that the basic rate of seven percentis not countervailable because it is not limited to a specific enterpriseor industry or group of enterprises or industries. Absent the provisionof new evidence, or an allegation of changed circumstances, we have nobasis upon which to re-initiate an investigation of this type of investmenttax credit.3. EDP Loan Guarantees and GrantsAvailability of loan guarantees and grants through the Enterprise DevelopmentProgram was investigated in Groundfish. We determined that the provisionof loan guarantees and grants under this program was not limited to a specificenterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries. Absent theprovision of new evidence, or an allegation of changed circumstances, wehave no basis upon which to re-initiate an investigation of the provisionof loan guarantees and grants under this program.4. Federal Expansion and Development/Northern Ontario (FEDNOR)FEDNOR is a federal economic development program which provides grantscovering up to 35 percent of eligible capital costs. The program is targetedto promote the economy of northern Ontario. Petitioner provided no evidenceto show that potential respondents are located in northern Ontario. Therefore,we are not initiating an investigation of this program.The petitioner has alleged certain other subsidies. However, these allegationswere not submitted in proper form. If allegations in proper form are submittedin the future, we will consider whether or not to include them in our investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Allegation of Critical Circumstances</ITAG>Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to importsof limousines from Canada. Petitioner claims that the products concernedbenefit from export subsidies that are inconsistent with the Agreementon Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI, and XXIII of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and that imports have been massiveover a relatively short period. We will determine whether critical circumstancesexist with respect to these imports in our preliminary and final determinations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notification of ITC</ITAG>Section 702(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of this actionand to provide it with the information we used to arrive at this determination.We will notify the ITC and make available to it all non-privileged andnon-proprietary information. We will also allow the ITC access to all privilegedand business proprietary information in our files, provided it comfirmsthat it will not disclose such information, either publicly or under administrativeprotective order without the written consent of the Assistant Secretaryfor Import Administration.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Determination by ITC</ITAG>The ITC will determine by September 7, 1989, whether there is a reasonableindication that imports of limousines materially injure, or threaten materialinjury to, a U.S. industry. If its determination is negative, this investigationwill terminate; otherwise, this investigation will continue according tothe statutory procedures. This notice is published pursuant to section702(c)(2) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lisa B.
