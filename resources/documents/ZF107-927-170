 As aresult, you can use many spreadsheet techniques and functions to analyzeinformation stored in database format.andP;  This article describes how to createa database report by using database statistical functions and one-way andtwo-way data tables.andP;  In Symphony, data tables are known as what-if tables.andO;Throughout this article, however, we'll use the terms one-way and two-waydata tables.andP;  The advantages of these approaches are speed and simplicity.andO;The playoff is more powerful analysis.andM;Figure 1 shows a typical arrangement of sales data in a spreadsheet.andP;  Eachrow contains information about an individual sale, including the order IDnumber, the sale date, the dollar amount, the region in which the sale tookplace, and the person responsible for the sale.andP;  Each column contains aspecific type of information common to each sale.andP;  For example, column Acollects order ID numbers, column B has sale dates, and column D has saleamounts.andM;Simple statistical formulas located below the sales data calculate aggregatevalues.andP;  For example, an @SUM formula in cell D14 returns the total amount ofsales for the third quarter.andP;  An @AVG formula in cell D15 returns the averageamount of a third-quarter sale.andM;These formulas return a lot of useful information.andP;  But what if you want toperform a more detailed analysis of this sales data?andP;  For example, how mightyou analyze sales figures by region, by sales representative, by month, or bysales amount?andP;  You can perform these and many other types of analysis byusing a variety of spreadsheet functions.andP;  In essence, you can link databaseconcepts with spreadsheet operations to create informative and analyticalprinted reports.andM;Such a report appears in figure 2.andP;  It is a third-quarter sales report thatincorporates database statistical functions and data tables.andP;  It requiresthat your data be arranged in 1-2-3's or Symphony's database format.andP;  Inorder to select specific records, some of the calculations rely on Criterionranges.andP;  If you need to review or become familiar with the basics ofarranging data or using Criterion ranges, see &quot;When Your 1-2-3 Database GoesHaywire&quot; in the December 1988 issue of LOTUS.andM;Arrange Data for AnalysisandM;When you organize data in a spreadsheet, consider adding columns ofinformation that will make subsequent analysis easier.andP;  For example, sincethe sample report in figure 2 includes an analysis of sales by month, acolumn titled Month is included in the spreadsheet in figure 1.andP;  Column Ccontains the @MONTH(date) formulas, which return a number between 1 and 12,based on the month in which a sale took place.andM;It is also useful to assign a name to the range that contains the data.andP;  Thisrange name serves two purposes.andP;  You can use it in various formulas to referto the database.andP;  And you can use it in conjunction with the GOTO key to movequickly to the database from anywhere in the worksheet.andP;  In the examply, thename input is assigned to range A1..F12.andP;  Note that this range includes thefield names in row 1.andP;  If you append rows or columns to the database, youmust expand the dimensions of the named range to include the additional rowsand columns.andP;  1-2-3 and Symphony ignore records outside the named data range.andM;1.andP;  Analyze DataandM;with @D FunctionsandM;You may already have used simple statistical functions such as @SUM or @AVG.andO;With these functions, you usually specify a range as the argument.andP;  Forexample, the formula @SUM(D2..D12) uses as an argument the range of values inthe Amount column in figure 1.andP;  A variation on this theme occurs when youneed to calculate total sales for a region, for a sales representative, orfor a month.andP;  To perform these types of calculations, you use databasestatistical functions or, as they're more commonly known, the @D functions.andM;Each of the @D functions, except for @DQUERY in 1-2-3 Release 3, takes threearguments: database, offset, and criterion.andP;  The first argument, database, isthe range that contains the data and field names.andM;The second argument, offset, is a value that indicates the field or column inthe Database range that contains the data you want.andP;  To determine the offsetvalue, you count from the leftmost column in the database to the columncontaining the values needed in the calculation.andP;  The database's leftmostcolumn is numbered 0; the column immediately to its right is numbered 1; thenext column to the right is 2; and so on.andM;An @D function's third argument, criterion, is the Criterion range.andP;  Thisargument specifies how the @D function determines which records to use in itscalculation.andM;In the report in figure 2, cell D26 contains the formula@DSUM(input,3,crit1), which calculates the total sales for the northeasternregion.andP;  The range named input encompasses cells A1..F12.andP;  The offset valueis 3 because we want the @DSUM formula to examine the values in column DM theAmount field, which is three columns to the right.andP;  The Criterion range isthe range named crit1.andP;  It occupies cells H26..H27, and it looks like thisscreen.andM;To use range names in an @D formula, you must first assign the range name toa cell or a range.andP;  In this example, you would press slash (in symphony,press MENU) and select Range Name Create, enter the name crit1, and specifyrange H26..H27.andM;1-2-3 and Symphony calculate the result of the @DSUM formula by using thecriterion in cell H27 to select records from the range named input.andP;  In thiscase, the programs select only the records for the northeastern region, sinceNortheast is the criterion supplied in the Critireon range.andP;  As each recordis selected, the values in the column specified by the offset, column D, areadded together.andP;  The result is the total sales amount for the northeasternregion.andM;The database statistical formula in cell D27 is similar to the one in cellD26.andP;  This formula, however, determines the number of sales that occurred inthe third quarter in the northeastern region.andP;  The formula looks like this:@DCOUNT(input,1,crit1).andP;  Since the @DCOUNT function merely counts the recordsthat match the criteria, it doesn't matter which field you specify as theoffset value.andP;  You are merely interested in counting records.andM;The Criterion range, crit1, is the same one used by the @DSUM formula in cellD26.andP;  When possible, it's a good practice to use the same Criterion range indifferent formulas.andP;  Doing so saves you the work of entering a new Criterionrange and keeps the worksheet smaller so that it uses less memory.andP;  When youbase several formulas on the same Criterion range, be careful not to makechanges in criteria that may affect the results of other formulas.andM;2.andP;  Use Data TablesandM;The preceding examples showed you how to find the total amount and totalnumber of sales for the northeastern region.andP;  But suppose you want tocalculate these values for every region or, as in the following example, forevery sales representative.andP;  To calculate these results quickly, you cancreate a one-way data table like the one in range B33..D37.andP;  It presents eachsales representative's total number and total amount of sales.andM;To set up this data table, you enter the names of sales representatives inrange B34..B37, the first column of the table.andP;  You must leave the upper-leftcell in the Table range blank.andP;  In the example, that is cell B33.andM;Next you must set up a Criterion range.andP;  Since you want to examine all therecords in the database, you need to set up a Criterion range that does notcontain any limiting criteria.andP;  This enables all the records to be selectedand tallied.andP;  This Criterion range, named crit2, looks like the followingscreen.andM;The best way to create field names for a Criterion range is to copy them fromthe database.andP;  This eliminates mismatches that are caused by typing errors.andO;And since this example has six field names, copying is also quicker.andP;  Inorder to create this Criterion range, you copy range A1..F1 to cell H32.andO;Then use the Range Name Create command to assign the name crit2 to rangeH32..M33.andM;Once you've created the Criterion range, you enter in the first row of thetable one @D function for each type of calculation you want.andP;  In this examplewe calculate the number of entries in the range and the sum of those entries.andO;In cell C33 we enter the formula @DCOUNT (input,1,crit2), and in cell D33 weenter the formula @DSUM(input,3,crit2).andP;  The results of these formulas do notappear in the figure because the Hidden format is assigned to cells C33 andD33.andP;  This prevents the formulas from cluttering the appearance of thereport.andM;To calculate the values in the table, use the Data Table 1 (in Symphony, MENURange What-If 1-Way) command.andP;  Specify range B33..D37 as the Table range.andO;Note that you do not include in the Table range the labels in row 32.andP;  Theyare provided for clarity.andP;  The program does not use them in calculations.andM;Next, 1-2-3 and Symphony prompt you for the input cell, which is the cellinto which the program sequentially copies each sales representative's namewhen it generates the table.andP;  Since the table is organized according to thenames of the sales representatives, the input cell is the cell in theCriterion range under the field heading Sales_Rep.andP;  This is cell M33.andM;Once you specify the input cell, the program copies Rogers, the first name inthe list, into the input cell.andP;  It then calculates the values of @DCOUNT and@DSUM for this name and places the results in cells C34 and D34.andP;  The programcontinues to calculate the results of the @D formulas for each salesrepresentative, and places the results in the table.andP;  While the calculationsare being made, the screen display is not updated.andP;  Once 1-2-3 and Symphonyfinish calculating all the values in the table, they display the results.andM;If you change, add, or delete records in the Database range, you mustrecalculate the table.andP;  It is not updated automatically.andP;  If you add recordsto the Database range, be sure to expand the range to include the additionalrecords.andM;Symphony users must select the Range What-If 1-Way command to update thetable.andP;  1-2-3 users can reissue the Data Table 1 command or press the TABLEkey and the data table will recalculate instantly.andM;3.andP;  Use a Table for Two-Way AnalysisandM;As you might guess, you can set up a two-way data table to analyze dataaccording to two data fields.andP;  For example, a two-way data table in rangeB43..E47 analyzes third-quarter sales by region and by month.andM;To set up this table, you enter the names of regions in the first column ofthe table, leaving the cell in the upper-left corner of the table blank.andO;Next you enter the month numbers in the first row of the table, leaving theleftmost cell in this row blank.andP;  In the report, we've entered month names inrow 42.andP;  They are not part of the table but are supplied for clarity.andM;In the example, the month number corresponding to July, 7, is entered in cellC43, 8 in cell D43, and 9 in cell E43.andP;  These cells are then assigned theHidden format to keep their contents from appearing in the report.andM;Now enter the formula @DSUM(input,3,crit2) in cell B43, which is in theupper-left corner of the table.andP;  In the example this cell is also assignedthe Hidden format.andP;  As in the one-way data table, the Criterion range in thisexample should not contain any criteria, since you want all records to beselected for the report.andM;To calculate the values in the table, select /Data Table 2 (in Symphony, MENURange What-If 2-Way).andP;  Specify cells B43..E47 as the Table range, cell L33 asthe first input cell, and cell J33 as the second input cell.andM;The program copies each label listed in the first column of the table intothe first input cell.andP;  That's why you specify cell L33, which is in theCriterion range under the field name Region.andP;  The second input cell is wherethe program copies each month number listed in the first row of the table.andO;This is cell J33, the cell in the Criterion range under the field name Month.andM;Once you enter the second input cell, the program starts calculating thetable values.andP;  It copies the label Northeast and the month number 7 to thetwo input cells.andP;  Using these criteria, it calculates the first @DSUM formulaand places the result in cell C44.andP;  The rest of the formulas are calculatedin a similar manner until the table is complete.andM;As in the one-way table, if you change information in the database or addrecords to it, you must recalculate the table.andP;  In 1-2-3 press the TABLE keyor reissue the Data Table 2 command.andP;  In Symphony reissue the Range What-If2-Way command to update the table values.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
