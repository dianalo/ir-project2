The regulations, proposed Tuesday by the Labor Department, wereapplauded by two unions that represent health-care employees andother workers who would be affected, although one of the unionssuggested some minor changes.   ``We sincerely hope that the department lives up to itscommitment to finalize the standard at the very latest by the endof the year,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the ServiceEmployees International Union.   In addition to 4.7 million health-care workers, the governmentsaid the regulations would protect 600,000 people working in lawenforcement, fire and rescue squads, corrections facilities,research laboratories, blood banks and the funeral industry.   The regulations would require employers to study any procedureswhich could expose workers to blood or other potentially infectiousmaterials, identify workers who perform such tasks, and takeappropriate steps to reduce the risk of exposure, including awritten infection control plan and use of protective clothing.   The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administrationestimated that the regulations would prevent about 10,000infections and 200 deaths a year among health-care workers. Theywould replace general OSHA safety requirements for handling anddisposal of potentially contaminated items with measures designedto deal specifically with AIDS, hepatitis and other diseasescarried by blood and bodily fluids.   Preliminary OSHA estimates put the average annual cost ofcomplying with the regulations at $1,373 apiece for theapproximately 600,000 workplaces affected, ranging from $32,875 fora hospital to $141 for funeral service establishments.   A hospital industry group, the American Hospital Association,said its staff was reviewing the proposal and had no immediatecomment.   If unchanged after a period of public comment, the regulationswould require:   _That all blood and certain bodily fluids be handled as if theywere infected with the AIDS-producing human immunodeficiency virus,or HIV, the hepatitis B virus and other blood-borne viruses.   _A number of controls for disposal of potentially infectiousmaterials, including leak-proof, puncture-resistant and clearlylabeled containers for the disposal of needles and otherpotentially infectious materials.   _Clear labeling and signs in areas where potentially infectiousmaterials are handled or stored.   _Employers to offer free hepatitis B vaccines to workers who onaverage are exposed to potentially infectious fluids once or more amonth. That represents a shift from the Reagan administration,which during early consideration of the regulations opposed forcingemployers to pay for the costly vaccine.   _Employers to provide, and employees subjected to possibleexposure to infectious materials to wear, protective clothing.   One of labor's complaints was language allowing that provisionto be ignored if donning protective clothing ``would interfere withthe proper delivery of health care of public safety situations.''   Jordan Barab, occupational safety and health director for theAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, saidlabor supported allowing workers to decide to proceed withoutprotective clothing in life-threatening situations. But Barab saidthe language in the proposed regulations was too vague and did notspecify whether such a decision should rest with an employee oremployer.   Labor's second concern was that the regulations did not containlanguage, often found in new OSHA regulations, requiring employersto make engineering improvements to reduce potential hazards. Suchimprovements, which often include development of new machines andtechniques of handling potentially hazardous marterials, areconsidered more foolproof than requiring protective clothing.   A draft of the regulations released in January required improvedengineering controls where possible.   ``The proposal has been seriously weakened,'' said AFSCMEPresident Gerald McEntee.   OSHA estimated workplace exposure results in 6,000 to 7,400hepatitis B infections each year in the United States, causing upto 400 hospitalizations and between 130 and 165 deaths. The agencysaid it did not have such estimates for HIV exposure, but saidfewer workers were exposed to the AIDS-producing virus than wereexposed to hepatitis.</TEXT></DOC>
