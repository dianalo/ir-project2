Sony, Matsushita and NEC -- which have collectivelyspent billions of yen exploring every facet of multimedia software design --have yet to hire a single phenomenologist. But just wait a year or two.;  Increasingly, the most exciting areas in software research -- virtual reality,artificial life and artificial intelligence -- are being shaped as much bymetaphysics as by silicon physics. Seminal papers are now populated withreferences to philosophers ranging from Wittgenstein to Derrida. The design ofa computer-constructed &quot;virtual reality&quot; is just as likely to draw inspirationfrom the philosophical musings of an Umberto Eco or a Jean Braudillard as anytechnical breakthroughs.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TECHNOLOGY WILL BE SHAPED BY PHILOSOPHY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Innovation; Michael Schrage writes about technology's impact on our lives forthe Los Angeles Times.

Philosophers such as the University of California's John Searleand Rand Corp.'s Hubert Dreyfus were like theater critics panning theperformances of computer programs purporting to emulate &quot;thought&quot; and &quot;themind.&quot; Both sides delighted at sniping at the intellectual pretensions of theother.;   But over the past decade, both the technology and the discourseincreased in sophistication. As a result, technological design andphilosophical inquiry are no longer on parallel paths. They've converged.Indeed, the more complexity, choice and opportunity a technology creates, themore it draws upon genuine philosophical inquiry as a design resource. Thereal future of software design will lie more in philosophy than inengineering.;   &quot;I'm worried that some people might think these are fadsrather than genuine attempts to go for the root of things,&quot; says John SeelyBrown, who runs Xerox's influential Palo Alto Research Center, one of theworld's pioneering computer laboratories. &quot;But you know, you can't build alearning organization with a brain-dead theory of knowledge.&quot;;   Brown, aphysicist who also gives seminars with titles such as &quot;Postmodernism andOrganizational Architecture,&quot; argues that the technology is now reaching thestage where his technologists have to start asking the questions philosopherswould ask, and that philosophers now have a medium to test some of the ideasthey've been expounding.;   &quot;There is a shift in the science,&quot; agrees DannyHillis, the brilliant computer architect who designed the Connection Machine,a computer that literally links tens of thousands of processors, like neurons,into a giant, high-speed computational network. &quot;The (traditional) sequentialcomputer fooled people into thinking that there was the linear, causal pathand that the world could be constructed out of logical axioms. It turned outthat biology and consciousness never fit into that model. Today, parallelcomputers offer a much more complex model . . . a tool that lets us answerquestions and bring them out of the domain of philosophy.&quot;;   That's not tosay that reading German philosopher Martin Heidegger makes one a betterprogrammer, cautions Hillis, but there's little question that philosophers andthe designers of virtual realities and artificial life forms are nowconfronting the same questions.;   In fact, computer software is already beingtransformed by such epistemological entrepreneurs. Stanford Universitycomputer science Professor Terry Winograd, once an early champion oftraditional artificial intelligence research, began exploring Heidegger'sapproach to the role of language in making commitments and contracts.Ultimately, his work grew into The Co-ordinator, a very successful, albeitcontroversial, computer network software package that enabled people tocoordinate their work schedules and activities. The Co-ordinator wasn't justdesigned to manage information, it was designed to manage the language ofwork.;   There's no dominant design philosophy shaping the virtual realitiesand artificial lives and minds of tomorrow. There may just be a constantturmoil of competing philosophies. But the emerging reality is that, forbetter or worse, the future of technology is going to be the future ofphilosophy.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Michael Schrage column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911104  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  694  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, November 4, 199100309153,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
