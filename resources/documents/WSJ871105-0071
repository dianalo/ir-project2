Myers</HL><DD> 11/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTEXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><TEXT>   The past 20 years have witnessed an explosive increase in the number of programs under which the national government transfers money to state governments. In return for these federal grants, the states have &quot;voluntarily&quot; agreed to wide-ranging conditions and requirements only loosely related to the expressed purposes of the grants.    In essence, the states have been repeatedly &quot;bribed&quot; with federal tax dollars to relinquish their legitimate authority. The &quot;bribes&quot; have taken the form of conditional federal grants. A new executive order on federalism signed by President Reagan promises to put a welcome check on this.    The conditions imposed on grants to the states are now limited only by the overactive imaginations of federal officials:    --In return for highway-construction grants, states have been required to raise the drinking age, comply with a speed limit of 55 miles an hour, regulate billboard ads, hide junkyards, and limit the political activities of state employees.    --To qualify for mass-transit funds, states have been forced to accept various collective-bargaining requirements.    --To receive education grants, states have been required to implement affirmative-action programs.    Sometimes these requirements are the work of federal regulators, other times they are enacted by a willing Congress at the prompting of administration officials, and often they are the work of Congress alone. All in all, the federal Office of Management and Budget has identified at least 68 such regulatory requirements currently in effect -- requirements that undermine state authority and impose huge administrative burdens and costs on the states.    Some states have resisted these bribes, but only with great difficulty and at great cost. To do so, the states must deny residents the benefits of their federal tax dollars, and often ask them for higher state taxes as an alternative. As a result, conditional grants are virtually irresistible.    Of course, conditional grants are not the federal government's only weapon against state sovereignty. Other threats are posed by direct government regulations that preempt state law. Our active federal bureaucracy is even now considering whether the regulation of mud and water resulting from oil exploration and production is of sufficient national import to warrant federal pre-emption of state laws. While this issue may well be suitable for regulation, it is not a problem of national scope. The standards already set by the oil-producing states protect human health and the environment as well as federal regulations would. Legislatures in many of these states have passed resolutions urging the federal government to continue to defer to the states.    The question is not whether junkyards should be hidden, whether affirmative action should exist, or whether mud should be regulated. The question is whether these decisions should be made by federal officials in Washington or by state legislators who are responsive to the needs of their particular constituents.    Happily, the president's executive order answers this question in favor of the states. The order requires that &quot;in the absence of clear constitutional or statutory authority, the presumption of sovereignty should rest with the individual States&quot; with uncertainties &quot;resolved against regulation at the national level.&quot;    While the order does not affect all existing regulations, conditions and requirements, administration officials will be prevented from proposing legislation to Congress that would &quot;attach to Federal grants conditions that are not directly related to the purpose of the grant.&quot; Administration officials would also be required, &quot;to the maximum extent possible,&quot; to &quot;defer to the States to establish standards&quot; for programs. This may well create an institutional discipline within the executive branch inclined away from federal action and toward state autonomy.    Of course, the executive order will not halt Congress's usurpation of state authority; nor will it restore to the federal judiciary a healthy respect for legitimate state sovereignty guaranteed in the 10th Amendment. The executive order will not even constrain future presidents who may lack Mr. Reagan's commitment to federalism, since they could overturn this order by simply issuing one of their own.    However, for the time being, President Reagan's Executive Order on Federalism promises to give substance to the theory of federalism and to check some of the most disturbing recent developments in intergovernmental relations. As a result, it offers at least temporary hope to America's state legislators that, once again, the national government will exercise restraint and permit &quot;We the People&quot; to participate more fully in our own governance.    ---   Mr. Myers is an official of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group of state legislators. </TEXT></DOC>
