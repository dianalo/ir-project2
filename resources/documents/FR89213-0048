Harristo develop and test his invention, ``Extended Range Tankless Water Heater.''<T3>Scope: </T3>This Grant will aid in providing funding for a comprehensivewell-integrated plan as follows: (1) Fabrication of the ten productionprototype tankless heaters incorporating the new features of the design,variable flame matched with variable heat transfer surface and microprocessorcontrol system; (2) operational testing to evaluate, modify and finalizethe design will be performed on an engineering prototype prior to the productionprototype design; and (3) certification by the American Gas Association(AGA) which will permit sales and manufacturing to begin.The purpose of this project will be the operation of prototypes of an ExtendedRange Tankless Water Heater, a new design that will provide hot water overa wide range of flow rates without the need for a storage tank. The anticipatedobjective is to eliminate the storage tank which reduces hot water heatingenergy requirements, for an average family of four, by an estimated 19percent.<T3>Eligibility: </T3>Based on receipt of an unsolicited application, eligibilityof this award is being limited to Dr. James A. Harris, A Registered ProfessionalEngineer and Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Wichita StateUniversity. Dr. Harris is the inventor of the Extended Range Tankless WaterHeater and he has applied for a patent on the design. Dr. Harris has madearrangements for laboratory space, fabrication, testing services, and computeravailability for microprocessor software development. It has been determinedthat this project has high technical merit, representing an innovativeand novel idea which has a strong possibility of allowing for future reductionsin the nations energy consumption.The term of this grant shall be two years from the effective date of award.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> U.S. Department of Energy, Officeof Procurement Operations, Attn: Lisa Tillman, MA-453.2, 100 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.<ITAG tagnum="6">Scott Sheffield,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Director, Contract Operations Division ``B'', Office of ProcurementOperations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-3358 Filed 2-10-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
