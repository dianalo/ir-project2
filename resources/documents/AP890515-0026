With results from 56,548 of 75,358 ballot boxes nationwide,Menem tallied 5,913,943 votes, or 46.8 percent, the InteriorMinistry reported five hours after polls closed.   In second place, Eduardo Angeloz of the ruling Radical CivicUnion got 4,737,246 votes, or 37.3 percent, it said.   ``I've defeated an adversary, but I've regained a friend,'' saidMenem, who is governor of La Rioja Province. Menem, 58, andAngeloz, 57, were law school classmates at the University ofCordoba in the 1950s.   Angeloz called Menem to concede defeat and congratulate him.Angeloz, who is governor of Cordoba Province, told reporters he``will continue working in my province, and later I'll see what Ican do on the national level.''   Menem immediately tried to heal wounds from the long, bittercampaign. He told reporters in La Rioja, ``I'm going to ask him towork with me, and we'll go together toward a proposal of nationalunity.''   The vote count was to continue until 3 a.m. (2 a.m. EDT).   It was not a direct election. Instead the voters cast ballotsfor 600 presidential electors. Menem needs 301 to avoid a contestwithin the Electoral College that will meet Aug. 10.   The Interior Ministry did not release projections on electors,but Peronist spokesman Cesar Arias said party calculations indicateMenem will receive the votes of up to 350 electors.   Several thousand people gathered late Sunday outside thePeronists' campaign headquarters in a downtown Buenos Aires hotel.They sang the party's anthem and chanted, ``The Radicaldictatorship is going to fall.''   Turnout among the electorate of 20 million was projected at arecord 85 percent. Voting was calm and orderly across this SouthAmerican nation of 31 million.   The two main contenders were trailed by nine other candidates.   Pre-election polls had indicated the center-left Peronists wouldwin and Menem would replace President Raul Alfonsin of the centristCivic Union when his six-year term ends.   The principal campaign issue in Argentina, once one of theworld's wealthiest nations, was the economy, which has beendeclining since the mid-1940s and took a steep dip in recent months.   ``Today, we put our prejudices aside. The issues have divided usfor months, but now we put them on the back burner, and we're allconcentrating on one thing: Today we are changing history,'' saidMedine Ruilio, a 53-year-old painter.   Alfonsin's inauguration in December 1983 ended nearly eightyears of military dictatorships. The constitution bars Alfonsinfrom seeking re-election. The new president will be inauguratedDec. 10.   Argentines also are electing a vice president, half the Chamberof Deputies, one national senator, legislatures in 14 of thenation's 22 provinces, and several thousand municipal officials.   Menem and Angeloz offered different visions of how Argentinamight overcome a chronic budget deficit, triple-digit inflation,rising unemployment and a $59 billion foreign debt.   In the 1930s, beef and grain exports to Europe placed thecountry among the world's 10 wealthiest nations.   Menem, the candidate of labor unions and the working poor,pledged to dramatically improve wages and hinted he might notcontinue payments on the foreign debt.   He has spoken vaguely of a ``productive revolution'' and``social pact'' to spur employment, slash the budget deficit, raisethe value of the national currency and curtail inflation.   Angeloz, the candidate of the middle class, pledged to sellinefficient state industries, maintain a free exchange rate, spurexports and diminish the power of the 4 million-strong GeneralLabor Confederation union, the cornerstone of the Peronist Party.   The biggest of the approximately 300 companies controlled by thegovernment were nationalized by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron when he wasin power between 1946 and 1955, the year he was ousted by amilitary coup. Currently, about 2 million Argentines of a workforce of about 11 million are employed by the state.   Despite some acrimony, campaigns were lackluster in comparisonwith 1983, when the mood was jubilant, hopes were higher, crowdswere larger, and the main issue _ democracy _ clear-cut.   The election marked the first time an elected civilian replacedanother since 1928, when Hipolito Yrigoyen succeeded Marcelo T. deAlvear. Yrigoyen was overthrown by a military coup in 1930.   The Peronist Party claims 4 million members and has been thecountry's biggest since it was put together by Peron and he waselected in 1946. Following his overthrow in September 1955, theparty was banned and many of its leaders jailed or exiled until1973, when Peron returned from Spain and was elected more by anoverwhelming margin.   Following Peron's death July 1, 1974, his wife, Isabel, tookover as president. She was deposed by a coup in March 1976 and themilitary rulers jailed Menem.</TEXT></DOC>
