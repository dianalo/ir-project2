The set-up realized can take measurements downto 50/sup 0/C, and 30/sup 0/C in a next future. The sensor signal ispre-amplified and then processed by a lock-in amplifier. An IR referenceinternal source is used to deliver a known constant level to the sensorand allows absolute temperature measurements. The present measurementaccuracy obtained with a blackbody at 200/sup 0/C is +- 0.5/sup 0/C.We are about to use such a device for monitoring irradiated fuel rodstemperature in the Superphenix 1 breeder power plant. 8 figs., 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
