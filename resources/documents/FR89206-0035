The regulation establishes requirements for the finaluse and disposal of sewage sludge when the sewage sludge is applied tothe land, distributed and marketed, placed in monofills (sludge-only landfills)or on surface disposal sites, or incinerated. The standards for each enduse and disposal method consist of either limits on the pollutant concentrationsin sewage sludge or equations for calculating these pollutant limits; managementpractices; and other requirements that prescribe the level of managementcontrol that treatment works, users, and disposers must exercise over sewagesludge. EPA also is proposing monitoring, record keeping, and reportingrequirements.Today's standards apply to publicly and privately owned treatment worksthat generate or treat domestic sewage sludge, as well as to any personwho uses or disposes of sewage sludge from such treatment works. Consistentwith the statute, the proposed rule requires compliance within 12 monthsof the date the rule is promulgated, or within 24 months if the regulationrequires construction of new pollution control facilities. Qualified publiclyowned treatment works (POTWs) that comply with the requirements in 40 CFRPart 403 may be eligible to revise categorical pretreatment standards applicableto industrial users in order to allow additional discharges into POTWsof the pollutants included in this rule.The proposed standards do not apply to sewage sludge treatment processesthat precede final use or disposal or to domestic sewage that is treatedalong with industrial waste and wastewater by privately owned industrialfacilities. In addition, standards are not established in this Part forsewage sludge that is determined to be hazardous using the procedures in40 CFR Part 261, Appendix II, or to sewage sludge found to contain greaterthan 50 parts per million (ppm) of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Requirementsin 40 CFR Parts 261-268 apply to sewage sludge determined to be hazardous,and requirements in 40 CFR Part 761 apply to sewage sludge containing greaterthan 50 ppm of PCBs. Compliance with these requirements will constitutecompliance with section 405 of the CWA.Included in this Notice are conforming amendments to 40 CFR Part 257. Theconforming amendments remove the applicability of Part 257 for sewage sludgedisposed of by those practices for which EPA is proposing standards today.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>EPA will accept public comments on this proposed rule untilAugust 7, 1989.EPA will conduct two 2-day workshops to discuss the technical bases ofproposed rule and will hold several public hearings to take oral commentson the proposal.

Treatment produces an effluent that is discharged and sewagesludge. The sewage sludge usually contains more than 90 percent water,in addition to solids and dissolved substances. The chemical and biologicalconstituents of the sludge depend upon the composition of the wastewaterentering the treatment facility and the subsequent treatment processes.Typically, these constituents may include the following: volatile organicsolids; nutrients; disease-causing pathogenic organisms (e.g., bacteria,viruses, etc.); heavy metals and inorganic ions; and toxic organic chemicalsfrom industrial wastes, household chemicals, and pesticides.The CWA of 1977 amended section 405 by adding subsection (d), which directedEPA to develop regulations containing guidelines for the utilization anddisposal of sewage sludge. The regulations were to identify uses for sewagesludge, including disposal, and identify factors to be taken into accountin the use or disposal of sewage sludge. In addition, the regulations wereto specify concentrations of pollutants which would interfere with sewagesludge use or disposal. The Water Quality Act of 1987 amended section 405(d)by adding a formal requirement that, on the basis of available information,EPA identify the toxic pollutants in sewage sludge that may adversely affectpublic health or the environment and, in regulations, specify managementpractices and establish numerical limits for each of the pollutants. TheAct requires that the standards be adequate to protect public health andthe environment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effects of thepollutants.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Determinations</ITAG>Except for establishing a schedule for promulgation of the regulations,Congress provided little other guidance for the Agency to carry out itsbroad mandate to protect public health and the environment. Unlike thetechnology-based requirements of other provisions of the CWA under whichthe Agency determines appropriate pollutant discharge standards based onthe pollutant reduction capabilities of equipment, the directive of section405(d) requires the Agency to address a much broader range of issues. Todevelop standards that adequately protect public health and the environment,the Agency must examine and integrate a substantial volume of informationand make determinations in a number of different areas. Today's proposalreflects the Agency's determinations on the following issues.<T3>Scope of the Regulation.</T3> Different types of sewage sludge aregenerated and there are different ways of using or disposing of it. Giventhe different types of sludge that are generated, which types should theAgency regulate? Of the methods used by communities to dispose of theirsewage sludge, which types and methods should the Agency regulate?<T3>Pollutant Coverage.</T3> On what basis should the Agency select thepollutants (metals, pesticides, organic contaminants, pathogenic organisms)which are regulated in today's proposal?<T3>Pathways of Exposure.</T3> What media (air, water, soil) transportthe pollutants in sewage sludge into and through the environment?<T3>Target Organisms. </T3>What individuals or groups of individuals, plants,or animals are most likely to be affected by the pollutants in sewage sludge?<T3>Models.</T3> How will the Agency simulate the movement of the pollutantsin sewage sludge into and through the various environmental media to thetarget organisms?<T3>Type of Risks.</T3> What are the potential human health and environmentalrisks posed by the use or disposal of sewage sludge (e.g., breathing airaround a sewage sludge incinerator, drinking water from a well near a monofill,eating food grown on soil to which sludge has been applied, plants growingon sludge-enriched soil, etc.) that the Agency should examine?<T3>Effect Levels.</T3> At what concentration does a pollutant adverselyaffect human health and the environment?<T3>Effects.</T3> What are the effects the standards should be designedto prevent (e.g., increased risk of developing cancer or hypertension,phytotoxicity, animal toxicity, etc.)?<T3>Background Pollutant Levels.</T3> What are the sources of pollutantexposure other than sludge (e.g., lead from gasoline or from water supplypipes, etc.)?<T3>Acceptable Level Of Risk.</T3> What level of risk adequately protectshuman health and the environment?<T3>Uncertainties.</T3> How should the Agency measure and account for theunavoidable uncertainties in its analyses (e.g., use conservative assumptions,add a margin of safety)?<T3>Type Of Effects To Be Evaluated.</T3> Should the Agency evaluate thehuman health and environmental effects on the most exposed target organisms(individual, plant, or animal) or should the Agency also examine the incidenceof adverse effects on the total population associated with sewage sludgeuse or disposal?<T3>Pollutant Limits.</T3> Should a single pollutant limit be establishedfor all use or disposal practices or should a separate pollutant limitbe established for each use or disposal method?<T3>Form Of The Pollutant Limits.</T3> How should the pollutant limitsbe expressed (e.g., a limitation on pollutant concentrations in sewagesludge, a limitation on pollutant loading rates to the land, a limitationon pollutant emission rates, etc.)?<T3>Regulatory Responsibility.</T3> Who should be responsible for meetingthe requirements in the rule (end user, treatment work)?<T3>Impacts.</T3> Who is affected by the rule? What are the benefits andcosts of the proposal?Since 1984, the Agency has been conducting an extensive information-gatheringand analytical program to support the development of today's proposal.Subsequent to the 1987 amendments to the CWA, the Agency redoubled itsefforts. This preamble, the technical support documents, and related analysesof the proposal's impact are the product of that effort and explain thebasis for the determinations the Agency has made in establishing thesestandards.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fundamental Regulatory Principles</ITAG>The fundamental assumptions underlying today's proposal are discussed below.Expand the Standards LaterThe scope of the Part 503 standards is necessarily constrained by the adequacyof information on sewage sludge pollutants and means of use or disposal.However, rather than wait for more complete information in order to proposeall-inclusive regulations, the Agency is proposing standards for thosepollutants and use or disposal methods for which there was sufficient information.The Agency will expand and refine these standards in future rulemakings.Section 405 specifically contemplates that the Agency will issue thesestandards in stages and revise them periodically.To remedy existing information gaps, the Agency is conducting a NationalSewage Sludge Survey which will gather, among other things, additionalinformation on the pollutants in sewage sludge. Furthermore, in cooperationwith other Agency offices, EPA is gathering data on the movement of certainpollutants into and through the environment (e.g., dioxins and pathogenicorganisms), refining and expanding its modeling capability for specificpollutants or disposal methods (e.g., pathogenic organisms, sewage sludgesurface disposal sites), supplementing its information on disposal methods(e.g., sewage sludge incinerators, municipal solid waste incinerators co-firingsewage sludge, sewage sludge surface disposal sites), and identifying thecharcteristics of industrial sludge with a domestic sewage component.In addition during the comment period, EPA will have experts form bothinside and outside the Agency review the scientific and technical basesof the proposal. This review may include the Agency's Science AdvisoryBoard, the Cooperative State Research Service, Regional Research TechnicalCommittee (sometimes called the W-17C Committee), representatives of academia,and/or other scientific/technical bodies with expertise in the areas coveredby this proposed rule. With the additional data and the scientific andtechnical review of the proposal, the Agency should be able to expand andrefine the standards.Coordinate With Other ProgramsThe use and disposal of sewage sludge affect air, soil, and water. In preparingthis proposal, the Agency carefully examined the requirements of othermedia programs and media-specific statutes. Where possible, for consistency,the Agency used the tools and standards developed under these other programs.For example, the air models used in developing the limits for the incinerationof sewage sludge are the models used under EPA's air program. Thus, thepollutant limits for the incineration of beryllium and mercury are basedon the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Pollutants (NESHAPs).The limit for the incineration of lead is based on the National AmbientAir Quality Standard (NAAQS) for lead. This principle is followed throughoutthe proposal. Therefore, when the pollutant limits are designed to protectground water, the Agency used the drinking water standards (maximum contaminantlevels_MCLS), where available. When protecting surface water, the Agencyused the water quality criterion developed for individual pollutants.In some cases, regulatory standards are undergoing revision. If the Agencyhas proposed an alternative standard, as in the case of the drinking waterstandard for lead, the preamble describes and shows the effect of the newstandard on the pollutant limit for a use or disposal practice. If theAgency's analyses have not reached a point at which a regulatory optionhas been selected, the preamble notes that when a new standard is promulgated,the numerical limit for a disposal practice will be revised.Control Sewage Sludge QualitySection 405(d) of the CWA directs the Agency to control the quality ofsewage sludge by establishing pollutant limits for a use or disposal method.Preventing the contamination of sewage sludge before it is used or disposedof is more equitable than requiring others to contain the contaminatedsludge or to deal with the consequences. Only when it is not feasible forthe Agency to set pollutant limits does section 405(d)(3) authorize managementpractices to contain the pollutants_the approach taken by the Agency inthe criteria it has proposed for solid waste disposal in municipal solidwaste landfills (MSWLFs) (53 FR 33314, August 30, 1988).By setting limits on sludge quality, the regulation creates incentivesfor treatment works to generate clean sludge. Treatment works with sewagesludge that does not meet the standards must clean up the influent (e.g.,strengthen their pretreatment programs), improve their treatment of sewagesludge (e.g., reduce the densities of pathogenic organisms), or selectanother use or disposal method.Emphasize Waste Reduction and the Beneficial Reuse of Sewage SludgeAchievement of desired national levels of environmental quality dependon the reduction and elimination of the substantial volumes of waste andwastewater generated at home and at work. Without a significant reductionin these volumes (e.g., by home composting food scraps rather than puttingthem down a garbage disposal), and a corresponding reduction in the residualfrom treatment (sludge) which must then be either used or disposed of,attainment of these goals is severely hampered.Closely linked to the Agency's objective of reducing the volume of wastegenerated, is EPA's policy of strongly supporting the beneficial reuseof sewage sludge. Improving the productivity of our land with the soilconditioning properties and nutrient content of sewage sludge has humanhealth and environmental advantages beyond those that are directly associatedwith applying sewage sludge to the land. Secondary or related benefitsof reusing sewage sludge result from a reduction in the adverse human healtheffects of incineration, a decreased dependence on chemical fertilizers,a reduction in the emissions associated with incineration that contributeto the ``greenhouse effect'' and a reduction in fuel or energy costs associatedwith incineration. Prior to finalizing the rule, the Agency will carefullyconsider, and place heavy emphasis on, those comments and approaches thatsupport the Agency's policy of beneficial reuse.Preserve a Local Community's Choice of a Disposal MethodAlthough the Agency's preference is for local communities to beneficiallyuse their sewage sludge, EPA's responsibility is to set standards, foreach method, that are adequate to protect public health and the environment.While the choice of a use or disposal method is reserved by section 405(e)of the CWA to local communities, protection of public health and the environment,where risks are significant, dictate stringent pollutant limits. EPA believescommunities, in certain cases, will be unlikely to meet the limits theAgency has proposed. For example, communities are unlikely to meet thelimits that would allow them to place sewage sludge in a monofill overClass I ground water (i.e., an irreplaceable source of drinking water).Base the Rule on Minimizing Risks to Individuals and to the Populationas a WholeThe Agency evaluated the effect of a pollutant on the most exposed individual,plant, or animal (MEI) and on the population as a whole. Regulatory optionswere examined that would have resulted in a rule based on aggregate incidenceanalyses only (the effect on the whole population), on MEI analyses only,and a rule based on a combination of aggregate and MEI analyses. Today'sproposal uses a combination of aggregate and MEI analyses.For use or disposal methods that do not result in high levels of pollutantexposure to the MEI and that do not result in significant incidence ofdisease (e.g., applying sewage sludge to non-agricultural lands, placingsewage sludge in surface disposal sites), the pollutant limits are basedon current sludge quality (i.e., the 98th-percentile pollutant concentrationshown in ``Fate of Priority Pollutants in Publicly Owned Treatment Works''_the``40 City Study''_Reference number 36). However, where current sludge qualityand disposal methods result in high levels of pollutant exposure to anindividual or to the population as a whole, or where there are significantscientific uncertainties as to the effect of a pollutant in a use or disposalpractice, pollutant limits are based on models designed to protect theMEI.Propose Reasonable StandardsSection 405(d)(2)(D) of the CWA requires the Agency to establish standardsthat are adequate to protect human health and the environment from anyreasonably anticipated adverse effects of each pollutant. The Agency examinedthe effect of long-term pollutant exposure and circumstances that could:(1) Increase the toxicity and potency of a pollutant in the environment;(2) speed the movement of a pollutant into and through the environment;and (3) intensify the adverse effect that the pollutant may have on humanhealth or the environment.This approach is used throughout the rule to take account of potentialdata inadequacies, but does not protect against every conceivable combinationof adverse conditions. In taking such an approach, the Agency recognizesthat some risks may not have been fully evaluated and that some risks mayremain after regulation. For example, the Agency used the average backgroundvalue of metals in agricultural soils for applying sewage sludge to agriculturallands and assumed that users of sewage sludge would follow simple labelinstructions. EPA expects that few, if any, individuals will receive higherdoses of a pollutant than the doses used to establish the standards. Therefore,the Agency has made the determination that the proposal meets the statutorydirective that the standards protect against reasonably anticipated adverseeffects of the pollutants.Propose an Implementable RuleThe proposal balances the flexibility associated with site-specific analysesagainst the simplicity of national numerical limits. A rule that allowsexceptions for every conceivable contingency would prove difficult to understand.Moreover, implementation of such a rule would require an unwarranted commitmentof the Agency's limited resources. Therefore, exceptions to national pollutantlimits are few, based on a minimum number of site-specific conditions thatwould make a significant difference in the pollutant limits.Section 405(e) of the CWA requires treatment works generating or treatingsewage sludge, as well as persons using or disposing of sewage sludge,to comply with the technical standards. Realistically, the Agency can notissue permits to every user of sewage sludge. Therefore, primary responsibilityis placed on treatment works for ensuring that sewage sludge meets therequirements of the rule. Greater flexibility is provided in the standardsif the treatment works control the use or disposal practice or when, throughagreements or other contractual mechanisms, the treatment works can effectivelycontrol the disposal. When this is impractical (e.g., when sewage sludgeproducts are sold or given away to the general public), sewage sludge mustmeet higher standards of quality. However, the limits were not designedto protect against every conceivable misuse of the product that is distributedand marketed. Rather, the rule assumes that simple instructions on theproper use of the product will be followed.Solicit Comment on a Wide Range of IssuesIn addition to explaining the proposal, the preamble discusses alternativeapproaches that have been used by other programs at the Agency regulatingpollutants in the various media and that were considered during the developmentof the rule. The Agency is soliciting public comment on the fundamentalprinciples of the rule, the carcinogenic risk levels proposed, other humanhealth and environmental criteria that could be used in establishing thenumerical limits, changes that may occur because of other Agency actions(e.g., changes in the MCL and air standards for lead), the models, theMEI and aggregate risk analyses, the anticipated benefits and costs ofthe rule, and the data deficiencies. A separate part of the preamble integratesand summarizes the issues and questions raised throughout the preamble.Some have characterized the preamble as an Advanced Notice of ProposedRule Making (ANPRM). While the preamble has characteristics similar toan ANPRM, the Notice is a fully developed proposal. Unlike an ANPRM, thisNotice solicits comment on specific numerical limits and provisions ofthe rule. EPA prepared the broadest possible notice to solicit wide publicparticipation on a comprehensive range of issues in the decision-makingprocess and to identify areas in the proposal where the Agency should makechanges or repropose, if warranted, based on public comment and the datagathering initiatives underway.Summary of the Proposed RuleToday's proposal includes standards for the final use or disposal of sewagesludge when the sewage sludge is applied to agricultural and non-agriculturalland, distributed and marketed, placed in monofills or surface disposalsites, or incinerated. Standards are not proposed for sewage sludge thatis disposed with solid waste in MSWLFs. The disposal of sewage sludge inMSWLFs will be regulated under 40 CFR Part 258 (see 53 FR 33314, August30, 1988). In addition, the rule does not cover sewage sludge that is incineratedwith solid waste or disposed of in deepwell wet air oxidation systems.The rule applies to sewage sludge that is generated or treated by publiclyowned and privately owned treatment works treating domestic sewage andmunicipal wastewater. The rule does not apply to domestic sewage that istreated along with industrial wastewater by privately owned facilities.Sewage sludge that is determined to be hazardous under procedures in AppendixII of 40 CFR Part 261 is not included in this proposal, but must be disposedof in compliance with the hazardous waste regulations in 40 CFR Parts 261through 268. Compliance with those regulations will constitute compliancewith Section 405. Also, sewage sludge that is found to contain 50 ppm ormore of PCBs is excluded from this proposal. Sewage sludge with 50 ppmof PCBs must be disposed of in accordance with the requirements establishedin 40 CFR Part 761.Finally, the rule does not cover the ocean disposal of sewage sludge whichis regulated by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA).The Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-688, amended MPRSA to prohibitany person from dumping sewage sludge into ocean waters after December31, 1991. In addition, Congress limited ocean dumping during the interimperiod to those who were authorized as of September 1, 1988, to dump eitherunder an MPRSA permit or a court order. Further, Congress prohibited dumpingafter August 15, 1989, unless an MPRSA permit has been obtained by thattime. EPA is moving forward to issue permits under 40 CFR Parts 220 through228 for the limited universe of POTWs eligible to continue dumping.Today's proposal includes specific numerical limits or equations for calculatingthese limits for 28 pollutants in one or more use or disposal methods.Not every pollutant is regulated under each method.Today's proposal raises many precedential scientific, technical and policyissues. Therefore, the numerical limits included in today's proposal maychange, based on the Agency's data gathering initiatives and public comments.It would not be advisable for permit writers to use these proposed numericallimits before the Agency revises ``Guidance For Writing Case-By-Case PermitsFor Municipal Sewage Sludge'' scheduled for later this year.When sewage sludge is applied to agricultural lands, distributed and marketed,placed in monofills, or incinerated, numerical limits are established usingexposure assessment models designed to protect the MEI. The models areused for these practices because the MEI and the population as a wholeare likely to receive a high level of pollutant exposure or because thereare significant uncertainties about the effect of a pollutant in a useor disposal practice.The numerical limits derived from the exposure assessment models are basedon human health or environmental criteria already published or promulgatedby the Agency, on human health criteria developed by the Agency, or onplant and animal toxicity values published in the scientific literature.When sewage sludge is incinerated, the numerical limits for beryllium andmercury are based on the NESHAPs for these pollutants, and the numericallimit for lead is based on the NAAQS for lead. When the objective is toprotect sources of drinking water, pollutant limits were developed whichwould ensure the MCLs are not violated. When the objective is to protectsurface water, Water Quality Criteria are used.If the Agency has not published or promulgated criteria for specific pollutants,EPA is proposing to use reference doses listed in the Agency's computerizedIntegrated Risk Information System (IRIS) and risk specific doses correspondingto an incremental carcinogenic risk level of 1andmultiply;10^4, except whensewage sludge is incinerated. For the incineration of sewage sludge, numericallimits are established to ensure pollutant levels do not exceed a riskspecific concentration corresponding to an incremental carcinogenic risklevel of 1andmultiply;10-5. Terrestrial criteria designed to protect plantsor animals are based on toxicity values determined from the appropriatescientific literature. For sewage sludge that is disposed of in monofills or is incinerated, treatmentworks may submit site-specific datas for a limited number of physical parametersrelated to the site. The permitting authority will use the treatment works'site-specific data to re-calculate a numerical limit using EPA-approvedexposure assessment models. Because these re-calculated numerical limitsare based on the same human health and environmental criteria as the nationalnumerical limits, the re-calculated limits will adequately protect humanhealth and the environment. If practices do not result in high levels of pollutant exposure to theMEI and the aggregate analyses do not show significant human health effectson the population as a whole, the pollutant limits are based on existingsewage sludge quality. Numerical limits based on existing sewage sludgequality are derived from the 98th-percentile concentrations of the ``40City Study.'' These pollutant concentrations are used to establish numericallimits for pollutants in sewage sludge that is applied to nonagriculturallands or disposed of on surface disposal sites. The rule also lists pollutants for which removal credits may be authorized.In addition to the pollutants for which numerical limits are established,removal credits may be available for pollutants that EPA examined withoutestablishing numerical limits. No limits are established for this lattergroup of pollutants because either the Agency determined that at the concentrationsfound in sewage sludge, these pollutants do not interfere with the particulardisposal practice or, for the incineration of sewage sludge, the Agencyis proposing to establish numerical limits for total hydrocarbons ratherthan for individual organic pollutants. The rule establishes limits for pathogenic organisms or indicator organisms(fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci/enterococci) for sewage sludgethat is applied to land, distributed and marketed, or disposed of in monofillsor on surface disposal sites. The proposal also includes requirements forreducing the attraction of vectors to sewage sludge. Supplementing the numerical limits are management practices and other generalrequirements to reduce levels of pathogenic organisms and to prevent grossabuse of the environment. For the distribution and marketing of sewagesludge, the rule requires the distributor to label the product or to includeinformation sheets with the product. The labels or information sheets areto identify the contents of the product and to provide instructions onthe proper use of the product. The rule also proposes monitoring, record keeping, and reporting requirements.The frequency with which sewage sludge is to be monitored depends on thesize of the treatment work. The pollutants for which treatment works mustmonitor their sewage sludge depend on their use or disposal method. Therecord keeping and reporting requirements are also specific to a particularmethod of use or disposal. The proposed rule is expected to cover approximately 5,300 of the approximately15,300 POTWs that use one or more of the methods included in the proposal.These 5,300 facilities generate or treat approximately 55 percent of thesewage sludge. Of the remaining POTWs, an estimated 6,700 dispose of theirsewage sludge (41 percent of the total sludge generated) in MSWLFs thatare to be regulated under the proposed 40 CFR Part 258 (53 FR 33314, August30, 1988). The remaining 3,300 POTWs use other disposal practices not coveredin either this proposal or the MSWLF proposal. The Regulatory Impact Analysis estimates that current use or disposal practicescontribute 12.3 cancer cases annually, based on a life time cancer riskranging from 5andmultiply;10-2 for incineration to 2andmultiply;10-8 for theland application to non-agricultural land. The other health effects areprimarily associated with lead exposure and result in 5,998 cases of hypertension,diminished learning capacity in children, or prenatal birth effects. TheAgency estimates the benefits of the proposal to be a reduction of 9.5cancer cases and a reduction of 5,266 lead cases. The Agency estimates that the use or disposal of sewage sludge costs POTWsapproximately $844,000,000 annually. For the purpose of the regulatoryimpact analysis, the Agency estimated that approximately 509 POTWs mayhave sewage sludge which does not meet the proposed numerical limits. Thisestimate does not take into consideration the possibility that some POTWsmay come into compliance by using site-specific data to calculate new numericallimits and by imposing more stringent pretreatment requirements on theirindustrial dischargers. The Agency estimates annual compliance costs of$157.7 million (in 1987 dollars) or an increase of $5 annually for eachhousehold served by the POTWs. The total annual incremental compliancecosts include costs for sludge monitoring, management practices, and, insome cases, incremental costs of changing a practice for POTWs that failto meet the numerical limits. The technical support documents, aggregate human health risk analyses,the regulatory impact analyses, and the preamble discuss the factors thatEPA considered, the data it evaluated, and the determinations that it madein developing today's proposal. The preamble summarizes this informationin 15 parts. Part I briefly describes the generation, volume, and constituents of sewagesludge and the factors that communities must consider in using or disposingof the sewage sludge that results from the treatment of domestic sewageand municipal wastewater. Part I also identifies the ways in which communitiescommonly use or dispose of their sewage sludge, the benefits of reusingsewage sludge, and the risks associated with its disposal. Part II lists existing Federal and State requirements for the use and disposalof sewage sludge including the relationship of the existing requirementsto today's proposal. In Part III, the preamble begins to describe how the Agency developed theproposed rule. Initially, the Agency selected pollutants most likely tointerfere with the safe use or disposal of sewage sludge and then refinedthe list of pollutants based on the availability of information on thetoxic effects of the pollutants. In refining the intial list of pollutants, the Agency simulated the movementof pollutants into and through the environment with a series of exposureassessment models to determine the concentrations of pollutants reachingan individual, plant, or animal. Part IV describes these models, the assumptionsused in the models, and the questions and uncertainties about the models.Parts V and VI discuss the human health and environmental criteria thatthe Agency considered and used in determinning the concentration at whicha pollutant would cause an adverse human health or environmental effect.Prior to selecting its approach for establishing standards for a particularuse or disposal method, the Agency examined the aggregate human healtheffects on the nation from the use and disposal of sewage sludge. The methodsused to conduct these analyses and the results are described in Part VII.Part VIII discusses the four regulatory options considered by the Agencyfor establishing numerical limits and management practices. Included inthe discussion are the factors on which the Agency based its selectionof a regulatory approach that would adequately protect public health andthe environment. Part IX describes, in separate subparts, the requirements that apply tothe use and disposal of sewage sludge and explains how and why they wereselected. Examples illustrate how the pollutant limits are calculated and,where applicable, how the numerical limits may be recalculated based onsite-specific data. The Agency discusses alternatives that were consideredand invites public comment. In addition, separate subparts of Part IX describethe pathogen and vector attraction reduction requirements; the pollutantseligible for removal credits; and the monitoring, record keeping, and reportingrequirements. Part X briefly discusses the implementation of the rule through Federaland State permit programs. Under a separate rulemaking, the Agency proposedState program management requirements and changes in the National PollutantDischarge Elimination System permitting requirements (see 53 FR 7642, March9, 1988). The benefits, costs, and regulatory impact of the proposed rule are discribedin Part XI. This part also discusses the data limitations and assumptionsand determinations that the Agency made in fulfilling its responsibilitiesunder Executive Order 12291. Throughout the preamble, issues are raised and alternatives are discussed.Public comment is invited on these issues and alternatives. Where dataare missing, the Agency identifies the information needed to complete itsdevelopment of the proposal. The issues, alternatives, and data on whichthe agency is inviting public comment are delineated in PART XII. Part XIII provides information on where interested persons may obtain copiesof the proposed rule, the technical support documents, the models usedin establishing the numerical limits, the aggregate effects assessment,and the regulatory impact analysis. Included in this part is the list ofreferences cited throughout the preamble. Part XIV describes the proposed changes in 40 CFR Part 257. These changesare limited to removing from coverage in Part 257 sewage sludge disposalmethods which will be subject to the new standard the Agency is proposingin 40 CFR Part 503. Finally, Part XV lists the subjects in 40 CFR Parts 257 and 503.<ITAG tagnum="84">PART I: GENERATION, USE, AND DISPOSAL OF SEWAGE SLUDGE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Generation of Sewage Sludge </ITAG>The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires municipalities to clean their wastewaterprior to discharging it. Wastewater treatment generates sludge which inturn must either be disposed of or used. Sludge management begins withsludge generation and continues through sludge processing and ultimatedisposal (see Figure I-1). <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 33 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG>Domestic wastewater contains material flushed into household drains throughtoilets, sinks, and tubs. Components of domestic sewage include soaps,shampoos, human excrement and tissue, food stuffs, detergents, pesticides,household hazardous waste, and oil and grease. Typically a family of fourdischarges 300 to 400 gallons of wastewater per day.Domestic wastewater is treated at its source in septic tanks, cesspools,portable toilets, or in publicly or privately owned wastewater treatmentworks. These treatment works may treat domestic wastewater alone, or acombination of domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater.Municipal wastewater treatment works may use one or more levels of treatment(i.e., primary, secondary, or tertiary) to clean this wastewater. Eachlevel of treatment provides both greater wastewater clean-up and greateramounts of sludge.Primary treatment processes remove the solids that settle out of the wastewaterby gravity. This generates 2,500 to 3,500 liters of sludge per millionliters of wastewater treated. Primary sludge contains three to seven percentsolids, 60 to 80 percent of which is organic matter. The water contentof primary sludge can easily be reduced by thickening or by removing water.Secondary treatment produces a sludge generated by biological treatmentprocesses. Biological treatment processes (e.g., activated sludge systems,trickling filters, and other attached growth systems) utilize microbesto break down and convert the organic substances in the wastewater to microbialresidue. These processes remove up to 90 percent of the organic matterin the wastewater and produce a sludge that typically contains from one-halfto two percent solids. These solids are generally more difficult to de-waterthan primary sludges. The organic content of the solids ranges from 50to 60 percent. Secondary treatment processes increase the volume of sludgegenerated over primary treatment by 15,000 to 20,000 liters of sludge permillion liters of wastewater treated.Advanced wastewater treatment processes, such as chemical precipitationand filtration, produce an advanced or tertiary sludge. Chemical precipitationuses chemicals to remove organics and nutrients and to separate the solidsfrom the wastewater. Characteristics of these sludges vary depending uponthe type of advanced treatment process used and the type of wastewaterentering the treatment process. Because these sludges typically containconsiderable amounts of added chemicals, the solids content will vary from0.2 to 1.5 percent, while the organic content of the solids will be inthe 35 to 50 percent range. Tertiary treatment increases the volume ofsludge generated over secondary treatment by another 10,000 liters of sludgeper million liters of wastewater treated.Sewage sludge contains from 93 to 99.5 percent water, as well as the solidsand dissolved substances that were present in the wastewater or that wereadded or cultured by the wastewater treatment process. While virtuallyall sewage sludge contains nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) and significantnumbers of pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and eggs of parasiticworms), some sludges also contain more than trace amounts of organic chemicals(e.g., chloroform) and inorganic chemicals (e.g., iron). These pollutantscome from domestic wastewater, from the discharge of industrial wastewaterto municipal sewers, and from the runoff from parking lots and lawns andfields where fertilizers and pesticides were incorrectly applied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sludge Processing</ITAG>Prior to reusing or disposing of sewage sludge, treatment works generallythicken, stabilize, and dewater the sludge. Sludge thickening is the removalof water from sludge to achieve a volume reduction. The reduction in sludgevolume decreases the capital and operating costs of subsequent sludge processingand disposal operations. For example, lowering the volume of sewage sludgereduces transportation costs. EPA estimates that the cost of transportingsewage sludge with a 22 percent solids content over a 20 mile trip is aboutone-half the cost of transportating sewage sludge with a six percent solidscontent over the same distance.Treatment works frequently digest or compost their sewage sludge to reducethe level of pathogens and odors. The degree to which a sludge is processedis very important when applying sewage sludge to land, when distributingand marketing it, and when placing sewage sludge in monofills or on surfacedisposal sites in order to eliminate the spread of pathogenic diseases.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amount of Sewage Sludge Generated</ITAG>Approximately 15,300 publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) generate 7.7million dry metric tons of sludge annually (see Table I-1), or 64 poundsof sewage sludge (dry weight basis) for every individual in the UnitedStates. This volume is expected to double by the year 2000 due to populationgrowth, stricter wastewater treatment requirements, and a greater numberof better-operated POTWs. The sewage sludge generated each year would fill185,950 railroad cars, which, if connected, would span half the country.Unless the volume of sludge is reduced, the nation cannot achieve its environmentalquality objectives. Treatment alone is not the answer. Communities shouldconsider the following measures: Implementation of waste separation andwater conservation programs; encouragement of the recycling of garbagein compost piles; separation of household hazardous waste prior to collectionand handling; and separation of storm water from wastewater sewer systems.These measures have proved successful in reducing the volume of wastewatergenerated and in improving the quality of the sewage sludge that is ultimatelyused or disposed of.<ITAG tagnum="84">Use and Disposal Methods</ITAG>The following are common methods of using or disposing of sewage sludge:application to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; distribution andmarketing of sewage sludge for use in home gardens; disposal in landfills,monofills, and on surface disposal sites; incineration; and ocean disposal.Table I-1 shows the amount of sludge that is generated based on the sizeof a facility and on the amount of sewage sludge that is disposed of bya use or disposal practice. Table I-2 shows the number of facilities usinga particular method of use or disposal.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>TABLE </T4>1-1._<T4>Amount of Sewage Sludge Generated by Size of POTW and Disposed of bya Use/Disposal Practice*</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Thousands of dry metric tons per year]</ITAG><H1>Use/disposal practice</H1><H1>Size of POTW</H1><H2>0andless;0.2 MGD</H2><H2>0.2andless;1 MGD</H2><H2>1andless;10 MGD</H2><H2>10andgreater;60 MGD</H2><H2>andgreater;60 MGD</H2><H2>Total</H2><H1>Use/disposal practice as percent of total</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Land application<D>23.1</D><D>103.0</D><D>438.3</D><D>321.5</D><D>316.2</D><D>1,202.2</D><D>15.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Distribution and marketing<D>0.1</D><D>4.0</D><D>36.3</D><D>97.5</D><D>567.5</D><D>705.5</D><D>9.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Municipal landfills<D>56.5</D><D>278.6</D><D>1,043.1</D><D>899.5</D><D>884.7</D><D>3,162.3</D><D>41.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Monofills<D>0.1</D><D>2.8</D><D>25.5</D><D>44.5</D><D>28.5</D><D>101.4</D><D>1.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Surface disposal<D>27.6</D><D>33.5</D><D>40.9</D><D>79.9</D><D>15.5</D><D>197.5</D><D>2.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Incineration<D>0</D><D>0.6</D><D>94.1</D><D>383.6</D><D>1,173.1</D><D>1,651.4</D><D>21.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ocean disposal<D>0</D><D>0.3</D><D>1.2</D><D>35.4</D><D>387.4</D><D>424.4</D><D>5.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other <D>37.8 </D><D>45.8</D><D>56.0</D><D>109.3</D><D>21.1</D><D>270.0</D><D>3.5</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>145.3 </D><D>468.6</D><D>1,735.5</D><D>1,971.2</D><D>3,394.0</D><D>7,713.6</D><D/><R>n,d,d,d,d,d,d,n</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Size class as percent of total<D>1.9</D><D>6.1</D><D>22.5</D><D>25.5</D><D>44.0</D><D>100</D><F>*Assumptions are that the amount of sewage sludge generated is identicalto the amount of sewage sludge disposed of and that a facility uses a singlepractice to dispose of its sludge.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>TABLE </T4>1-2._<T4>The Number of POTWS Using a Use/Disposal Practice and the Sewage SludgeGenerated by POTWS Using the Practice</T4><H1>Use/Disposal practice</H1><H1>POTWS using a practice number</H1><H1>Percent of POTWS</H1><H1>Volume generated (1000's of dry MT/year) volume</H1><H1>Percent of sewage sludge</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Land application<D>2,623</D><D>17.1</D><D>1,202.2</D><D>15.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Distribution and marketing<D>106</D><D>0.7</D><D>705.5</D><D>9.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Municipal landfills<D>6,664</D><D>43.5</D><D>3,162.3</D><D>41.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Surface disposal<D>2,395</D><D>15.6</D><D>196.4</D><D>2.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Monofills<D>49</D><D>0.3</D><D>101.4</D><D>1.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Incineration<D>169</D><D>1.1</D><D>1,651.4</D><D>21.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ocean disposal<D>25</D><D>0.2</D><D>424.4</D><D>5.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other<D>3,274</D><D>21.4</D><D>270.0</D><D>3.5</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>15,305</D><D>100.0</D><D>7,713.6</D><D>100.0</D><F>Source: Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Proposed Regulationfor Sewage Sludge Use and Disposal, November 1988.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Benefits of Reusing Sewage Sludge</ITAG>The organic and nutrient content of sewage sludge makes it a valuable resourceto use both in improving marginal lands and as a supplement to fertilizers.Although not a high grade fertilizer, the organic content in sewage sludgecontains $30 to $60 per dry ton worth of organic nitrogen and phosphorus.A study of sewage sludge and effluent use on selected agricultural cropsin one area of Oregon found that the return per acre of sludge applicationranged from a loss of $6 to an increase of $15 per acre, compared to traditionalfertilizer sources, depending on the crop rotation involved, previous soilmanagement practices, soil type, and level of sludge application. Thesewere net savings in the cost of fertilizers, taking into account the factthat the sludge was available at no cost to the farmer (Reference number7).The beneficial uses of sludge are not limited to the production of agriculturalcommodities. Sludge is used in silviculture to increase forest productivityand to re-vegetate and stabilize harvested forest land and forest landdevastated by fires, land slides, or other natural disasters. The applicationof sewage sludge to forest land shortens wood production cycles by acceleratingtree growth, especially on marginally productive soils. Studies at theUniversity of Washington on the use of sludge as a fertilizer in silvicultureshow height increases of up to 1,190 percent and diameter increases ofup to 1,250 percent compared to controls in certain tree species. Universityof Washington research has also shown that trees grow twice as fast onsludge-amended soil. This means that a tree which would typically be cutafter 60 years could be cut after only 30 years to supply lumber for avariety of purposes.Sludge is productively used to stabilize and revegetate areas destroyedby mining, dredging, and construction activities. Air-dried sludge thatlooks like compost is frequently used to fertilize highway median strips,clover leaf exchanges, and for covering expired landfills. Historically,land reclamation has been very successful and comparable in cost to othercommercial methods. In a strip-mined area in Fulton County, Illinois, reclamationusing municipal sewage sludge cost $3,660 an acre, as compared with a rangeof $3,395 to $6,290 an acre using commercial methods (Reference number86). Pennsylvania has used the sludge Philadelphia generates to reclaimover 3,000 acres of devastated lands. Sludge, in combination with fly ash,is currently used in the re-vegetation of soils that have become highlycontaminated from the operation of a zinc smelter in Palmerton, Pennsylvaniaover the past 90 years (Reference number 31).Our analyses show that current use practices, land application, and distributionand marketing pose less carcinogenic risk than disposal practices. On aper ton basis, carcinogenic risks from reusing sewage sludge range from2x10^8 to 9.9x10^7, while those from incinerating and disposing of sewagesludge in monofills range from 3x10^3 to 5x10^2.Studies using Philadelphia sludge have shown that the microbial communitiesin reclaimed mined soils revert to those of normal soils within 2 to 3years. It may take as long as 10 to 15 years, or even longer, with conventionalreclamation (Reference number 31).Forest soils have been found to be well suited to sludge application becausethey have high rates of infiltration (which reduce run-off and ponding),large amounts of organic material (which immobilize metals from the sludge),and perennial root systems (which allow year-round application in mildclimates). Although forest soils are frequently quite acidic, researchat the University of Washington has found no problems with metal leachingfollowing sludge application (Reference number 37). In addition, studiesof animals living on sludge treated sites have found that the animals arehealthier than those on control sites because of the increased availabilityof vegetative matter.The sale of sewage sludge products can be used to defray the costs of de-wateringand composting the sewage sludge, but there is no similar mechanism todefray the costs of de-watering sewage sludge placed in landfills or incinerated.Further, the labor, capital, and operating and maintenance costs of incineratingsewage sludge are substantial.The Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle (METRO), which treats wastewaterin the Seattle-King County region, began using sludge to improve soil inseveral Seattle area parks, restore land disturbed during strip mining,restore a gravel pit used for Interstate 90 construction, and enhance grassgrowth at the King County International Airport at Boeing Field. In October1983, the METRO Council adopted a Sludge Management Plan that outlinedits goal to use at least eight alternative sludge recycling or disposalmethods through the year 2000. METRO reports that its plants produced 65,000tons of sludge in 1985 and more than 91,000 tons in 1987. Sludge productionis expected to increase dramatically in the next decade after METRO's PugetSound plants are upgraded from primary to secondary treatment. The Agencysays that by creating a demand for sludge and developing a variety of recyclingoptions, it reduced program expenses from $227 per ton of sludge solidsin 1983 to $148 in 1987.The benefits of using sewage sludge to improve land productivity are substantial.However, if sewage sludge containing high levels of pathogenic organisms(e.g., viruses, bacteria) or high concentrations of pollutants is improperlyhandled, the sludge could contaminate the soil, water, crops, livestock,fish, and shellfish. The major human health, environmental, and aestheticfactors of concern in the land application of sewage sludge are relatedto pathogens, metals and persistent organic chemicals content, and odors.The standards proposed today would prevent the contamination of soil andcrops by pathogens, as well as the contamination of food and animal feedcrops by methods and organic pollutants when sewage sludge is applied tolands used in the production of agricultural crops or to lands that maybe converted to residential use. In spite of the benefits of reusing sludge, only 25 percent of the sewagesludge generated in the United States is effectively reused by applyingit to the land or by distributing and marketing it for use in home gardens(see Table I-2). In comparison, the 12 countries in the European EconomicCommunity apply 35 percent of their sewage sludge to the land. Japan uses42 percent of its sewage sludge for coastal reclamation and home gardenor farming uses. The United Kingdom applies 51 percent of its sewage sludgeto the land (Reference number 3). While the CWA reserves the choice of use and disposal practices to localcommunities, EPA's preference is for local communities to reuse this resourcein beneficial ways. On June 12, 1984, the EPA published its policy on themanagement of sewage sludge stating that the Agency will actively promotethose municipal sludge management practices that provide for the beneficialuse of sludge while maintaining or improving environmental quality andprotecting public health (see 49 FR 24358). When the quality of the sewage sludge appears to be a limiting factor foran otherwise desirable use, POTWs can require their industrial users topretreat contaminated industrial wastewater before discharging the wastewaterto the POTW for cleansing. Controlling the quality of industrial wastewaterdischarged into municipal sewers is an important element in managing thequality of sewage sludge. POTWs designed to accommodate flows of more than 5 million gallons perday and smaller POTWs with significant industrial discharges are requiredto establish local pretreatment programs. Approximately 1,500 of the nation's15,300 POTWs have local pretreatment programs. The local program must enforceall categorical pretreatment standards and may impose more stringent dischargerequirements (i.e., local limits) where necessary to prevent pollutantsfrom interfering with or passing through the POTW wastewater treatmentprocesses. In addition to wastewater reduction and the separation of contaminatedwaste from uncontaminated wastes, pretreatment of industrial wastewateris another key step in managing the quality of sewage sludge. If pretreatmentdoes not reduce the pollutant levels sufficiently, communities may haveto dispose of rather than use their sludge and, depending on the disposalmethod, add pollution controls and thereby increase the cost of sludgedisposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">Reuse Practices </ITAG>Land Application to Agricultural LandsSeventy-seven percent of the sludge applied to land (approximately 926,000dry metric tons) is used to improve the condition and nutrient contentof soil for agricultural crops, including row and feed crops and pastures.The method of applying sludge to agricultural land depends on the physicalcharacteristics of the sludge and soil and on the crops grown. Liquid sludgemay be applied with tractors, tank wagons, irrigation systems, or specialapplication vehicles. Liquid sludge may also be injected under the surfacelayer of the soil. De-watered sludge, on the other hand, is typically appliedto cropland by equipment similar to that used for applying limestone, animalmanures, or commercial chemical fertilizers. Generally, the de-wateredsludge is applied to the land surface and then incorporated by plowingor disking. When applied to pasture land, sludge is usually not incorporatedinto the soil.Land Application to Non-Agricultural LandsSludge application to forest land has been undertaken, at least on an experimentalfield-scale level, in 10 or more States. The most extensive experiencewith this practice is in the Pacific Northwest. Sludge is most often sprayedfrom mobile equipment into established forest stands as a partially de-watered,but still liquid, material. When sewage sludge is used to stabilize and revegetate land, typicallylarge amounts of sludge (usually 112 metric tons per hectare) are appliedon a one-time basis. This large amount is necessary to ensure that sufficientorganic matter and nutrients are introduced into the soil to support vegetationuntil a self-sustaining ecosystem is established.Distribution and Marketing Nine percent of the sewage sludge generated is distributed and marketed.As a method of managing sewage sludge, distribution and marketing is ahighly beneficial practice and one the Agency encourages. Usually, sewage sludge that is distributed and marketed is composted. Incomposting sewage sludge, the sludge is de-watered; mixed with a bulkingagent, such as wood chips, bark, rice hulls, straw, or previously compostedsludge; and allowed to decompose aerobically for a period of time. In thisform, the sewage sludge is dry and easier to distribute. It is also easierfor the user to handle. Sewage sludge that is distributed and marketedis used as a substitute for topsoil and peat on lawns, golf courses, parks,and in ornamental and vegetable gardens. Yield improvements have been valuedat $35 to $50 per dry ton over other potting media. Risks of Disposal MethodsCommunities should consider alternatives other than burying or burningtheir sludge. These are wasteful practices that pose risks and incur costs.Some methods of sewage sludge disposal, such as incineration and uncoveredlandfills, may contribute to global warming (i.e., the ``greenhouse effect'')by releasing carbon dioxide and methane.Sewage sludge with high concentrations of organic and metal pollutantscould pose human health problems, when disposed of in monofills or on surfacedisposal sites, if the pollutants leach out of the unit into the groundwater. Therefore, the concentration of the pollutants must be limited,or other measures must be taken, to ensure that ground water is not contaminated.For the incineration of sewage sludge, municipalities must take sufficientmeasures to control the emissions from sewage sludge incinerators. Otherwise,particulates, sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, heavy metals, toxic organiccompounds, and hydrocarbons will add to a community's air pollution problems.Ocean dumping of sludge, which Congress banned after 1991, may result inthe destruction of biota that influence the balance between oxygen andcarbon dioxide. In ocean disposal, there is a potential for the bioaccumulationof certain pollutants often associated with municipal sludge, includingmercury, cadmium, and polychlorinated biphenyls. High levels of these pollutantsmay interfere with the reproductive systems of certain marine organisms,may produce toxic effects in aquatic life, or may present public healthproblems if contaminated fish and shellfish are eaten. <ITAG tagnum="84">Disposal Methods</ITAG>Land Application to Dedicated SitesSludge is often disposed of at sites specifically set aside for sewagesludge disposal. Relatively large quantities of sludge (220 to 900 metrictons per hectare) are applied to sites for many years. No attempt is madeto use the nutrient and soil conditioning properties of the sewage sludge.The objective of this practice is to employ the land as a treatment systemby using soil to bind metals and by using soil microorganisms, sunlight,and oxidation to destroy the organic matter in the sludge. These sitesare generally owned by, or are under long-term leases to, a treatment work.Frequently, the dedicated land disposal site has a non-food chain vegetativecover crop (e.g., sod, pulpwood) to reduce the potential for runoff orleaching of the pollutants to surface or ground water.Landfilling Landfilling is a sludge disposal practice in which sludge is depositedin a dedicated area, alone or with solid waste, and buried beneath a soilcover. Landfilling is another disposal method that does not attempt torecover the nutrient content of the sludge for beneficial uses. However,the decomposition of organic matter in sewage sludge that is landfilledproduces methane gas. The methane gas can be recovered and yields an energyvalue more than half as great as that of natural gas. Forty-one percent of the sewage sludge disposed of by POTWs is landfilledwith municipal solid waste. In co-disposal, the absorption characteristicsof the solid waste and soil conditioning characteristics of the sludgecomplement each other. The solid waste absorbs excess moisture from sludgeand reduces leachate migration. Sewage sludge usually makes up five percentor less of the material in a solid waste landfill. Slightly more than one percent of the sewage sludge generated is disposedof in monofills (landfills only accepting sewage sludge). EPA has identified49 POTWs that dispose of their sewage sludge in monofills. Most monofillsconsist of a series of trenches, dug into the ground, into which de-wateredsludge is deposited and then covered with soil. Other monofill designs,in which the sludge is deposited on the ground surface (area fill mounds,area fill layers, and disked containment) do exist, but these are not commonlyused.Surface DisposalSewage sludge surface disposal, like land application to dedicated non-agriculturalland and disposal in monofills, is a disposal practice. The majority ofsurface disposal sites are smaller than one acre and receive less than50 gallons per day of waste.The Agency is collecting additional data on the characteristics of surfacedisposal sites, as compared to monofills or to dedicated non-agriculturalland-application sites. Generally, surface disposal sites do not have avegetative or soil over. Depending on the State in which they are located,surface disposal sites may be regulated in a manner similar to monofillsor landfills. In other cases, surface disposal sites are areas of landwhere sewage sludge has been placed for many years with little or no considerationgiven to its ultimate disposal.IncinerationIncineration is a disposal practice that destroys the organic pollutantsand reduces the volume of sewage sludge. Incineration takes place in aclosed device using a controlled flame. EPA estimates that approximately1.7 million dry metric tons of sewage sludge are incinerated each year,accounting for more than 20 percent of the sewage sludge disposed of byPOTWs.If the sewage sludge contains 20 percent solids, incinerators reduce thevolume of sewage sludge by about 90 percent, on a wet weight basis. Whilethis reduces the amount of material that must be landfilled, owners oroperators must control the concentration of the pollutants in the incineratoremissions to prevent exacerbation of a community's air pollution controlproblems. They must also allocate sufficient funds to pay for the labor,capital, operating, and maintenance costs of sewage sludge incinerators.Currently, 169 POTWs use 282 incinerators to dispose of their sewage sludge.Most of the incinerators (232) were built prior to 1973, when the New SourcePerformance Standards for Sewage Sludge Incinerators were published (40CFR Part 60, Subpart O). Multiple hearth incinerators are the most commonlyused sewage sludge incinerators. There are 231 multiple hearth incinerators(82 percent of the incinerators firing sewage sludge), 37 fluidized bedincinerators (13 percent of the total), and five electric incinerators.The remaining incinerators fire sewage sludge with solid waste in municipalwaste combusters. A description of these incinerators is included in the``Technical Support Document for Incineration'' (Reference number 56).Ocean DisposalOcean disposal of sewae sludge involves the transport of sludge on ocean-goingbarges to a specially designated site. Under the authority of the MarineProtection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) of 1972, EPA has approvedonly one site for the ocean disposal of sewage sludge, the 106-Mile OceanWaste Disposal Site. That site is located 106 nautical miles southeastof the Ambrose light and approximately 120 nautical miles southeast ofCape May, New Jersey. On November 18, 1988, the President signed the OceanDumping Ban Act of 1988, which prohibits the dumping of sewage sludge afterDecember 31, 1991. Until the ban goes into effect, permits will be issuedunder MPRSA to those municipalities that were authorized as of September1, 1988 to dump sewage sludge at the 106-Mile Site. In issuing permitsduring the interim period, the Agency will ensure that the rate of dumpingwill not attain a rate that would adversely affect aquatic life.<ITAG tagnum="84">PART II: FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS</ITAG>The use or disposal of sewage sludge is currently subject to some Federalregulation. Existing Federal regulations are authorized under several legislativemandates and have been developed independently along media-specified concerns.State regulations generally are keyed to Federal regulatory requirements,primarily those in 40 CFR Part 257, covering the land application and landfillingof sewage sludge, and those in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart O, covering sewagesludge incinerators.This part starts with a discussion of the requirements of the Clean WaterAir (CWA), followed by a description and summary of other Federal and Stateregulatory requirements and how they will relate to today's proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Clean Water Act Statutory Requirements</ITAG>Sewage sludge has been an important concern of the Agency since 1972, whenEPA, through the Federal Water Pollution Control Act construction grantsprogram began assisting in the financing of wastewater treatment facilities.The Clean Water Act of 1977 amended Section 405, mandating that EPA developguidelines for the use and disposal of sewage sludge. Under Section 405(d),EPA was required to issue regulations that:(1) Identify uses for sludge, including disposal;(2) Specify factors to be taken into account in determining the measuresand practices applicable to each such use or disposal (including publicationof information on costs); and(3) Identify concentrations of pollutants which interfere with each suchuse or disposal.Responding to this mandate, in 1979, EPA adopted criteria which providedguidelines for sludge utilization and disposal when sludge was appliedto land or disposed of in landfills. These criteria were included in regulationsco-promulgated under Subtitle D of RCRA and section 405(d) of the CWA andare found in 40 CFR Part 257. These regulations contain a number of specificrequirements for the management of sludge. To protect the ground water,the regulations prohibit any use or disposal of sludge that causes theconcentration of ten heavy metals and six organic chemicals in an undergrounddrinking water source to exceed maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) specifiedin the criteria. The criteria also included management standards applicableto sludge use or disposal methods to protect surface waters, flood plains,and endangered species. The criteria contain limitations on the concentrationof two pollutants (cadmium and polychlorinated biphenyls_PCBs) in sludgewhen the sludge is applied to the surface of land used for the productionof animal feed or food-chain crops. In addition, the requirements in Part257 restrict sewage sludge disposal except in compliance with certain measuresto control pathogens and disease-carrying rodents, insects, and birds.The regulation provided for different levels of pathogen reduction, dependingon whether crops for direct human consumption were grown or animals forhuman consumption were allowed to graze on the sludge-amended soil. Themethods for reducing the levels of pathogens include aerobic and anaerobicdigestion, composting, lime stabilization, and heat treatment and drying.As part of its sludge regulatory program, EPA has prepared a number ofdocuments which provide guidance and direction to local publicly ownedtreatment works (POTWs) on the proper management and handling of sludge.EPA has actively encouraged and assisted in the development and implementationof various practices and processes leading to the beneficial use of sludge.In addition to supporting long-term research and demonstration projects,the Agency has also assisted in the development of detailed design guidancefor various beneficial methods of disposal and such technologies as digestion,composting, and lime stabilization. The Agency has also supported developmentof improved de-watering systems, pyrolysis, and other technologies to improveenergy recovery from thermal conversion systems, methane recovery fromanaerobic digestion systems, and the recovery of various potentially marketableby-products from sludge.A lack of action in developing the comprehensive sewage sludge regulationspromised in the preamble to the 40 CFR Part 257 rule (44 FR 53439, September13, 1979) led to the creation of an Intra-Agency Sludge Task Force in 1982.The Task Force was assigned the following tasks: (1) Conducting a multimediaexamination of sludge management, focusing on sludge generated by POTWs;and (2) developing a cohesive Agency policy on sewage sludge management,designed to guide implementation of the Agency's sewage sludge regulatoryand management programs. Numerous Agency offices and <T3>ad hoc </T3>groups had wrestled with sewage sludge management, butnone of these groups had been able to decide how to equitably regulate,on a national level, a complex and variable waste in an environmentallyprotective and cost-effective manner. Sewage sludge use or disposal involveda myriad of site-specific circumstances, could result in multimedia effects,and depended on proper planning and decision-making at the local level.The Agency lacked experience in developing performance standards for solidwaste that would attenuate multimedia environmental effects. Furthermore,at that time, Congress had not provided a compliance mechanism for theregulations.The Task Force, which included representatives from all parts of the Agency,recommended that the Agency develop an integrated, comprehensive regulatorystructure for sludge use or disposal using the combined authorities ofsection 405 of the CWA and other laws. This structure would also incorporateexisting regulations and, where appropriate, new regulations to completeregulatory coverage where important gaps remained.While the Agency was working on a regulatory approach consistent with therecommendations of the Task Force, the Natural Resources Defense Councilsued the Agency over EPA's pretreatment regulation (40 CFR Part 403). Inthat suit, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (<T3>Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA</T3>, 790 F.2d 289, 3rd Cir.,1986) ruled that the pretreatment regulation was invalid in four respects.Most relevant here is the Court's fourth holding:<ITAG tagnum="21">We hold that, despite EPA's contention that sludge regulations arein place, EPA's device of incorporating other regulations does not meetthe statute's command for a comprehensive framework to regulate the disposaland utilization of sludge and that EPA cannot, in the absence of Section405(d) regulations authorize the issuance of removal credits under Section307(b)(1).</ITAG>Throughout its lengthy consideration of the amendments to the CWA, somemembers of Congress expressed concern that, without sewage sludge regulations,industry would continue to discharge toxic pollutants into wastewater forPOTWs to treat, making it more difficult for a city to find sludge managementalternatives. They believed sludge criteria would stimulate effective pretreatmentprograms and would encourage recycling and reuse of toxic pollutants byindustry. In the Water Quality Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-4, February 4,1987), Congress reaffirmed its directive that EPA develop comprehensivesewage sludge regulations and set forth a schedule for the agency to doso. The Water Quality Act amended section 405(d) to include requirementsthat:(1) By November 30, 1986, EPA propose regulations establishing numericallimits and acceptable management practices for toxic pollutants that EPAidentified as present in sewage sludge in concentrations which, on thebasis of information available on their toxicity, persistence, concentration,mobility, or potential for exposure, may adversely affect public healthor the environment; (2) By August 31, 1987, EPA promulgate regulations specifying acceptablemanagement practices and establishing numerical limits for these pollutantsthat ``shall be adequate to protect public and health and the environmentfrom any reasonable anticipated adverse effects of each pollutant;'' (3) By July 31, 1987, EPA identify and propose regulations for those toxicpollutants not identified in the regulations promulgated August 31, 1987,and promulgate regulations for those toxic pollutants by June 15, 1988;and (4) From time to time, but no less often than every two years, EPA reviewthe regulations for the purpose of identifying additional toxic pollutantsand promulgating regulations. The amendments specify that compliance with the requirements of the regulationsmust occur not later than 1 year after publication of the regulations,unless the regulations require the construction of new pollution controlfacilities. In this latter case, compliance must occur no later than 2years from the date of the regulations' publication. Section 405(d)(5) also provides that nothing in the section is intendedto waive more stringent requirements in the CWA or in any other law. Thismeans that States and local communities remain free to impose more stringentrequirements than those included in today's proposal. In addition, as describedlater in the preamble, where EPA has established requirements applicableto sewage sludge under other statutes, those requirements are includedin the proposed Part 503 requirements. <ITAG tagnum="21">Section 405(e) was further amended to read as follows: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The determination of the manner of disposal for use of sludge is alocal determination, except that it shall be unlawful for any person todispose of sludge from a publicly-owned treatment works or any other treatmentworks treating domestic sewage for any use for which regulations have beenestablished pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, except in accordancewith such regulations. </ITAG>The implications of this section are presented later in the preamble. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Federal Requirements </ITAG>Traditionally, the Agency has used the standards, definitions, and approachesdeveloped under other Federal public health and environmental programswhen they are consistent with the goals and objectives of the CWA. Theuse of other Federal standards in responding to the broad mandate of section405(d) is desirable in order to minimize duplicate, overlapping, and conflictingpolicies and programs. Further, as discussed above, section 405(d)(5) providesthat nothing in section 405(d) is intended to waive more stringent requirementsestablished under other statutes. Therefore, as previously indicated, oneprinciple followed in developing today's proposal was to base pollutantlimits on human health or environmental criteria established under otherstatutory authorities. Under section 304(b) of the CWA, the Agency publishes Water Quality Criteria.For the purposes of Part 503, these criteria are used in making the determinationthat a pollutant limit for a particular method of use or disposal wouldnot exceed a fresh-water quality criterion, should the pollutant reachthe surface water. When the concern is to protect the drinking water supplies,the basis of the pollutant limits is the MCLs promulgated under authorityof the Safe Drinking Water Act. The National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for lead, promulgatedunder authority of section 109 of the Clean Air Act, and the National EmissionStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for beryllium and mercury,promulgated under authority of section 112 of the Clean Air Act, were usedin developing the pollutant limits for these pollutants when sewage sludgeis incinerated. Other applicable regulatory requirements for the incinerationof sewage include the New Source Performance Standards for Sewage SludgeIncinerators promulgated under section 111 of the Clean Air Act and foundat 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart O. Owners or operators of sewage sludge incineratorsalso must ensure that their operations, including the location of new incinerators,conform to State Implementation Plans approved under the regulations authorizedby section 110 of the Clean Air Act and found at 40 CFR Parts 50 through51. <ITAG tagnum="84">State Requirements </ITAG>The information on existing State requirements summarized below was gatheredas part of EPA's effort in developing guidance for writing sewage sludgeinterim permits. Further information may be found in ``Guidance For WritingCase-By-Case Permit Requirements For Municipal Sewage Sludge'' (Referencenumber 52). After promulgation of the Part 503 standards, under section510 of the CWA, States and local entities will retain the authority toimpose more stringent standards than provided in this part. At present, 42 States have regulations or guidelines covering the landapplication of sewage sludge which set either a maximum allowable concentrationor maximum pollutant loading rate for at least one pollutant. Parallelingthe requirements in 40 CFR Part 257, 41 States have set restrictions onthe growing of crops on soil to which sludge has been applied (e.g., humanfood chain crops cannot be grown on sludge-amended soil until 18 monthsafter the application of the sewage sludge). In addition, 41 States haveestablished management practices for the land application of sewage sludge.When States regulate the giveaway or sale of composted sludge, it is regulatedunder State land application requirements. Eleven States have set numericallimits on the concentration of pollutants in sewage sludge that is distributedand marketed and 22 States have established management practices governingthe distribution and marketing of sewage sludge.Many States enforce landfilling restrictions for non-hazardous sludge thatfollow the requirements in 40 CFR Part 257. While States have not set maximumpollutant concentrations for sewage sludge that is landfilled, 31 Statesdo have some site restrictions or other management practices governinglandfills.Many States regulate the ambient emissions of sewage sludge incinerators.State implementation plans under the Clean Air Act limit emissions of variouspollutants subject to NAAQS or NESHAPs. Twenty States have establishedopacity limits as well as emission limits for beryllium, mercury, particulates,sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. No State has established a limitationon lead emissions from sewage sludge incinerators. Twenty-nine States haveregulations or guidelines governing operation of incinerators, includingdisposal of the ash.In one State, the development and enforcement of controls on all methodsof sewage sludge use and disposal are delegated entirely to local agencies,as is the issuance of permits. In other States, local as well as Statecontrols are imposed on the disposal of sewage sludge.<ITAG tagnum="84">PART III: SELECTION OF POLLUTANTS FOR REGULATION</ITAG>This part describes how the Agency selected the initial list of pollutantsfor which it is proposing numerical limits and the data bases used to collectinformation about the pollutants. Additional information may be found in``The Record of Proceedings on the OWRS Municipal Sewage Sludge Committees''and ``Summary of the Environmental Profiles'' (Reference numbers 80 and41).<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial List of Pollutants</ITAG>In the Spring of 1984, EPA enlisted the assistance of Federal, State, academic,and private sector experts to determine which pollutants, likely to befound in sewage sludge, should be examined closely as possible candidatesfor special numerical limits. These experts screened a list of approximately200 pollutants in sludge that, if disposed of improperly, could cause adversehuman health or environmental effects. The experts were requested to revisethe list, adding or deleting pollutants. The test for inclusion or exclusionwas the potential risk to human health and the environment when sewagesludge containing a particular pollutant was applied to the land, placedin a landfill, or incinerated. The Agency also requested that the expertsidentify the most likely route through which a pollutant could reach targetorganisms, whether human, plant, or wild or domestic animals. The expertsattending the meetings recommended that the Agency gather additional environmentalinformation on approximately 50 pollutants. These pollutants are listedin Table III-1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table III-</T4>1._<T4>Pollutants Selected for Environmental Profiles/Hazards Indices</T4><H1>Pollutants</H1><H1>Land application</H1><H1>Landfill</H1><H1>Incineration</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Aldrin/Dieldrin<D>X</D><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene<D/><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzidine<D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzo(a) anthracene<D>X</D><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzo(a) pyrene<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Beryllium<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbon tetrachloride<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlordane<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlorinated dibenzodioxins<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlorinated dibenzofurans<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloroform<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cobalt<D>X</D><D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanide<D>X</D><D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">DDT/DDD/DDE<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,3andmin172;-Dichlorobenzidine<D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-Dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid<D/><D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dimethylnitrosamine<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fluoride<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Heptachlor<D>X</D><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorobenzene<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorobutadiene<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Iron<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lindane<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Malathion<D/><D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene bis (2-chloroaniline)<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene chloride<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methylethyl ketone<D/><D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Molybdenum<D>X</D><D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">PCBs<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol<D>X</D><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene<D/><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenol<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachloroethylene<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toxaphene<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trichloroethylene<D>X</D><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trichlorophenol<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tricresol phosphate<D>X</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vinyl chloride<D/><D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc<D>X</D><D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Profiles</ITAG>During 1984 and 1985, the Agency collected data and information from publishedscientific reports on the toxicity, persistence, means of transport, andenvironmental fate of these 50 pollutants. EPA also developed informationon their occurrence and concentration in sewage sludge by analyzing thesludge of 43 to 45 publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) (depending onthe pollutant) in 40 cities (``Fate of Priority Pollutants in PubliclyOwned Treatment Works''_the ``40 City Study''_Reference number 36). Thesludge data from the ``40 City Study'' consist of concentrations of 40pollutants (12 metals, six base neutral organic compounds, six volatileorganic compounds, nine pesticides, and seven polychlorinated biphenyls_PCBs)in sludge analyzed from the target POTWs.   Using this information on the occurrence and concentration of pollutantsin sewage sludge, their toxicity and persistence, the pathways by whichthe pollutants travel through the environment to a receptor organism (plant,animal, or human), the mechanisms that transport or bind the pollutantsin the pathway, and the effects of the pollutants on the target organism,EPA made a preliminary assessment of the likelihood that each pollutantwould adversely affect human health or the environment. For this analysis,EPA relied on simple screening models and calculations to predict the concentrationof a pollutant that would occur in surface or ground water, soil, air,or food. EPA then compared the predicted concentration with an Agency humanhealth criterion, such as a drinking water standard promulgated under theSafe Drinking Water Act, to determine whether the pollutant could be expectedto have an adverse effect on human health. For purposes of this initialscreening, EPA assumed conditions that would maximize the pollutant exposureof an individual, animal, or a plant, as well as the worst possible pollutant-relatedeffects.   Based on the factors previously listed (concentration, toxicity, persistence,etc.), EPA ``scored'' each pollutant and ranked them for more rigorousanalysis. EPA excluded two categories of pollutants for further evaluation.First, EPA excluded pollutants which, then compared to a simple index,presented no risk to human health or the environment at the highest concentrationthat the Agency found in the ``40 City Study'' or in other available databases. Second, EPA deferred consideration of pollutants for which therewere no EPA human health criteria or there were insufficient data.    Information on each pollutant, the simple screening models an calculationsused to describe the pollutant's path through the environment, and theindices used to evaluate the pollutants are compiled in an ``environmentalprofile'' for each pollutant. The summary of the environmental profilesis listed as Reference number 41 in Part XIII of the preamble. Table III-2 shows the pollutants EPA did not analyze further because thepollutant did not exceed an EPA human health or environmental criterionat the highest concentrations shown. The Agency invites commenters to submitany municipal sewage sludge data, that shows higher concentrations of thepollutant than those shown in the Table III-2. In addition, the Agencywould like any documented evidence which would contradict the Agency'sconclusion that, at the concentrations shown in Table III-2, these pollutantswould not cause adverse human health or environmental effects. The pollutantslisted in Table III-2 are included in the list of pollutants for whicheligible POTWs, complying with the requirements in Part 503, may, under40 CFR Part 403, apply for authorization to grant removal credits to theirindustrial dischargers (see Table 12 in andSection; 503.72).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>III-2._<T4>Pollutants That Were Evaluated and Found Not To Interfere With SewageSludge Use or Disposal</T4><H1>Pollutants</H1><H1>Disposal practice (concentration)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlordane<D>Monofill over Class II, III ground water (12 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium<D>Monofill over Class II, III ground water (1,499.7 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper<D>Incineration (1,427 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanide \1\<D>Land Application, Distribution and Marketing, Monofill (2,686.6 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dimethyl nitrosamine \1\<D>Distribution and Marketing (2.55 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-Dichlorophenoxy-acetic acid<D>Monofill (7.16 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fluoride \1\<D>Land Application, Distribution and Marketing (738.7 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Heptachlor<D>Incineration (0.09 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Iron \1\<D>Land Application, Distribution and Marketing (8,700 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Malathion<D>Monofill (0.63 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Molybdenum<D>Monofill (40 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>Monofill over Class II, III ground water (662.7 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol <D>Land Application, Distribution and Marketing (30.43 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenol<D>Monofill (82.06 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium <D>Monofill, Incineration (4.85 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachloroethylene \1\<D>Distribution and Marketing (13.07 mg/kg).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc <D>Monofill, Incineration (4,580 mg/kg).</D><F>\1\ Exposure assessment models were used in making the determinationthat these pollutants, at the concentrations shown, do not interfere wtihthe disposal of sewage sludge.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Table III-3 shows the pollutants for which a lack of data precludes theAgency from proposing numerical limits at this time.

Therefore, these two pollutants are likely to beincluded on a list of pollutants to be considered for future rulemakingproceedings.When EPA initiated these pollutant assessments in 1984, the Agency didnot include dioxin as a pollutant which it evaluated for this rule. Atthat time, EPA lacked the data required to assess numerical limitationsfor dioxin in sludge. Adequate data were not available on the levels ofdioxin or its pervasiveness in sewage sludge.The Agency did not analyze sludge for dioxins as part of the ``40 CityStudy'' because, at the time the samples were collected (1979-1980), methodologiesdid not exist for analyzing trace quantities (parts per trillion) of dioxinsin sewage sludge. Because better analytical methods now exist, the Agencyis collecting sewage sludge samples for dioxins analyses as part of theNational Sewage Sludge Survey (see discussion later in this part of thepreamble). When the analyses of the sewage sludge samples are complete, EPA will usethe National Sewage Sludge Survey data and recent scientific studies topropose numerical limits for dioxins. In the interim, as explained laterin the preamble, the Agency is limiting the emission of dioxins from sewagesludge incinerators by proposing a limit on total hydrocarbons. Table III-4 lists the 28 pollutants for which the Agency is proposing numericallimits when a particular method of use or disposal is employed. The pollutantsin Table III-4 will be eligible for removal credits. In addition to thepollutants listed in Table III-2 and Table III-4, all organic pollutantsfor which categorical standards have been promulgated by the Agency andfor which the Agency has developed numerical limits will also be eligiblefor removal credits if the sewage sludge is disposed of by incineration.The rationale for this approach is discussed in connection with SubpartH of the rule (andSection;andSection; 503.70 through 503.72) in Part IX ofthe preamble. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 80-81</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Use Of The ``40 City Study'' Data Base</ITAG>As discussed earlier in this part, the Agency relied on the ``40 City Study''data as the primary source of information on the pollutant concentrationsin municipal sewage sludge. At this time, the ``40 City Study'' providesthe most comprehensive and best documented nationwide data on the concentrationof pollutants in sewage sludge.EPA recognizes several deficiencies in using the ``40 City Study'' data.Key among them is the fact that data on final processed sewage sludge isgenerally not available from the ``40 City Study.'' The Study was designednot to assess the quality of the sewage sludge leaving a POTW, but to determinethe fate of section 307(a)(1) priority toxic pollutants entering the POTW.Moreover, some sludge samples were taken at points within the POTW priorto final sewage sludge processing. However, the Study did include informationthat enabled the Agency to estimate the final dry weight of pollutantsin the sewage sludge leaving the POTW.Another deficiency of the ``40 City Study'' is that the data were collectedin 1979 and in 1980. At that time, analytical methods for measuring organicpollutant concentrations in materials with high suspended solids contentwere in their infancy. Today, the analytical methods are far more preciseand analyses of materials with high suspended solids content are conductedroutinely by many laboratories.A third deficiency in using the ``40 City Study'' data is that the datamay not reflect the current sludge quality. The data were collected priorto the implementation of many pretreatment programs. In cities where pretreatmentprograms have been implemented, particularly for metals, the concentrationsof metals in sewage sludge may be lower than those shown in the ``40 CityStudy''. On the other hand, treatment works may find that their sewagesludge contains higher concentrations of organic pollutants because moreorganic wastes are discharged into municipal sewers as limits are imposedon the disposal of liquid hazardous wastes.Although other data sources of sewage sludge quality are available, theseother data sources are also deficient. EPA has been unable to use thesefor a number of reasons. Some data were drawn from too narrow a geographicarea or were drawn from POTWs of a particular size. Frequently, these datawere not collected systematically and different sampling and analyticalprotocols were used in the same survey. In addition, many of these otherdata were collected prior to the ``40 City Study'' data.EPA believes that based on currently available information, the ``40 CityStudy'' data are the appropriate data on which to base its proposal. Althoughthese data were obtained nearly ten years ago, analyses of recent datasubmitted by the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies suggestthat the ``40 City Study'' data, particularly for metals, provide a reasonablebasis for developing a proposal (see Reference number 36). However, EPAbelieves that the ``40 City Study'' data need to be supplemented to supportthe final regulation. Therefore, EPA is conducting a National Sewage SludgeSurvey to provide a current and a reliable data base that will be usedto set pollutant limits for a limited number of practices, to better assessthe risks of sewage sludge disposal practices, and to evaluate the impactof the rule. The data base will also be used in developing a list of pollutantsfrom which the Agency will select additional pollutants for further analysesand potential regulation under section 405(d) of the CWA.The results from the National Sewage Sludge Survey are necessary for anumber of essential analyses required before promulgation of the finalregulation. In establishing numerical limits, the Agency needs the pollutantconcentration data from the National Sewage Sludge Survey to determinethe level of risk posed by current sludge quality and current use or disposalmethods. EPA must also have the data from the Survey to test the reasonablenessof its analyses and regulatory approach. Some areas of concern includethe accuracy of anticipated risks and analyzed characteristics of increasedincidence of disease in proximity to particular use or disposal methods.This information will assist the Agency in further evaluating today's regulatoryapproach.In addition, as will be explained later in the preamble, the Agency isproposing to use current sludge quality as the basis of the numerical limitswhen sewage sludge is applied to non-agricultural land and when sewagesludge is disposed of on surface disposal sites because insignificant adversehealth impacts are anticipated from these use and disposal methods. TheNational Sewage Sludge Survey may show that other use or disposal methodshave a similar insignificant impact. In that case, the Agency may concludethat the numerical limits for other use of disposal methods should be basedon current sludge quality.The results of the Survey will also be used to assess the potential shiftsamong the various use or disposal methods as a result of today's proposal.The effect of today's proposal is an important element in determining howto implement the regulation. For instance, if there is likely to be onlya slight impact from a particular numerical limitation, immediate implementationmay be appropriate. If, on the other hand, wide shifts in current methodsof use or disposal are anticipated from the numerical limits, it mightbe appropriate to assist the POTWs in the development of more stringentpretreatment limits for their industrial dischargers or in the adoptionof alternative use or disposal methods.In collecting data for the survey, EPA is sending a questionnaire to arandom, stratified sample of 479 POTWs employing secondary or advancedwastewater treatment processes and is sampling the sludge from a subsetof the 479 POTWs receiving a questionnaire. The statistical sample is designedto produce a statistically unbiased national estimate of the volume ofPOTW-generated sewage sludge, the frequency with which particular pollutantsoccur in sewage sludge, and the concentrations of the pollutants foundin the sewage sludge analyzed. The sample is also constructed to allowseparate analysis by four POTW size groups as measured by wastewater flow(less than 1 million gallons per day_mgd, between 1 and 10 mgd, between10 and 100 mgd, and over 100 mgd) and by five use or disposal practices(land application, distribution and marketing, monofills, incineration,and others, primarily municipal landfills).An EPA representative is taking the sample and contract laboratories areanalyzing each sample. The sampling protocol is based on the proceduresin EPA's protocols for sampling and analysis (see Reference numbers 51and 55). The protocol includes procedures for selecting and documentingthe sampling point, handling and preservation, labeling, transmitting thesample to the laboratory, and chain-of-custody.The suite of 400 pollutants to be analyzed include those pollutants onthe CWA section 307(a) list of pollutants, those toxic compounds highlightedin the Domestic Sewage Study, and those Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct Appendix VIII compounds for which analytical methods have been developed.The chemical analysis of the sludge samples will be performed using standardEPA methods for conventional and organic pollutants and Method 8290 fordioxin developed by EPA's Las Vegas, Nevada Environmental Monitoring SystemsLaboratory. These protocols specify sewage sludge matrix clean up by gelpermeation chromatography followed by the use of gas chromatography-massspectrometry (GC/MS) together with isotope dilution. These methods providebetter performance in terms of detection, precision, and accuracy thanother GC/MS procedures. Further information on the National Sewage SludgeSurvey, including the sampling protocols and the questionnaire may be foundin the supporting statement for the survey (see Reference number 81).When completed, all survey reports and other analyses based on survey datawill be placed in the Regulatory Record in a masked form to protect anyinformation claimed to be confidential. EPA will notice the availabilityof the data and make it available to the public. Depending on the resultsof the analyses, the Agency may re-open the comment period on today's proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Coverage of the Proposal</ITAG>Today's proposal covers those pollutants and practices for which sufficientinformation is available for the Agency to establish numerical limits,management practices, and other requirements that will protect public healthand the environment from reasonably anticipated adverse affects of eachpollutant. The Agency recognizes that today's proposal is not comprehensive.The rule does not establish numerical limits for all pollutants or forradioactive sludge that may interfere with the use or disposal of sewagesludge.Section 405(d) of the CWA specifically contemplates a phase approach toestablishing numerical limits for sludge pollutants. Moreover, section405(d)(2)(D) of the CWA also provides that ``[F]rom time to time, but notless often than every 2 years, the Administrator shall review the regulation* * * for the purpose of identifying additional toxic pollutants and promulgatingregulations for such pollutants * * *'' The National Sewage Sludge Surveywill be used by the Agency to identify additional pollutants in sewagesludge that may interfere with the safe use or disposal of the sludge.From this list of pollutants, the Agency will initiate rulemaking processesto increase the coverage of this Part 503 rule. EPA is today proposingthe regulation called for by section 405(d)(2)(A). Additional pollutantsnot identified at this time will be regulated in the second phase requiredby section 405(d)(2)(B).The first step in the process is to determine if there is an EPA-derivedhuman health criterion for the pollutant. For those pollutants that havehuman health criteria, the Agency will gather sufficient data to evaluatethe pollutants using exposure assessment models and analytical techniquesEPA has developed for assessing the aggregate effects. The analytical techniquesare discussed in the next two parts of the preamble. If sufficient dataare available on a pollutant, the Agency will use the exposure assessmentmodels to make a determination as to whether the pollutant may interferewith the safe use and disposal of sewage sludge at the concentrations shownin the National Sewage Sludge Survey. If the pollutant does not pose anunreasonable human health or environmental risk, the Agency would proposethat the pollutant be added to the list of pollutants eligible for removalcredits. If, based on the exposure assessment models, the pollutant presentsan unreasonable human health or environmental risk, the Agency would proposenumerical limits for the pollutant appropriate to a particular method ofuse or disposal. Where the Agency has not developed a human health criterionfor a pollutant, EPA would begin to develop the data and information necessaryto establish a human health criterion for the pollutant, consistent withthe need for and priority of other pollutants. The process is time-consumingparticularly if the Agency also must develop a human health criterion.The Agency is soliciting public comment on the way in which it will expandthe coverage of pollutants included in the Part 503 rule. If there arepollutants that are not covered in this rule that should receive immediateattention in future rulemakings, such as dioxins and asbestos, the Agencywill consider any suggestions that are offered.<ITAG tagnum="84">PART IV: EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT MODELS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Introduction </ITAG>EPA adapted existing models and developed new models to determine the concentrationof sludge-borne pollutants that may be applied to the land, placed in sludge-onlylandfills (monofills), or incinerated without exceeding human health orenvironmental criteria (Reference numbers 48, 56, and 66). The models simulatethe movement of pollutants into and through the environment with a seriesof mathematical equations or algorithms. These equations or algorithmslink the pollutant disposal or release rates to the concentration of thepollutant that moves into the air, water, or terrestrial medium and, subsequently,reaches a target organism (i.e., plants, animals, and humans). Each algorithmin a model represents one exposure pathway through which sludge-borne pollutantsenter and pass through or effect an environmental medium. The target organism is a most exposed individual, plant, or animal (MEI)that remains for an extended period of time at or adjacent to the sitewhere the maximum exposure occurs. The models calculate individual pollutantexposure, relying on certain fixed assumptions about the exposure route.For example, the models assume inhalation of 20 cubic meters of air perday and an average individual diet and two liters of drinking water perday. Other assumptions included in the models are the location of the MEIrelative to the site where the sludge is placed and the source of foodin the diet of the MEI. The same duration of exposure is used as that assumedin developing the applicable human health or environmental toxicologicalcriteria (allowable doses). For example, where cancer risks are evaluated,the MEI is assumed to be continuously exposed for 70 years. The Agency's Science Advisory Board (SAB) reviewed the models but not thespecific values included in the model algorithms or the way in which themodels were used to calculate the proposed numerical limits. The majorcomments of the Board are discussed in conjunction with each of the modelsbelow. The complete report of the SAB is listed in Part XIII of the preamble.The Agency selected the appropriate numerical values for the parametersin the algorithms of each model, translated the models into computer programs,and, where appropriate, used the models to calculate the numerical limitsin today's proposals. The following sections discuss the models that theAgency used to assess the concentrations of the pollutants reaching theMEI when sewage sludge is (1) applied to the land used in the productionof agricultural commodities, (2) distributed and marketed, (3) landfilledin monofills, and (4) incinerated. In addition, the Agency is developing an exposure assessment model to beused in determining the fate of pathogenic organisms in the environmentand in determining the concentration of pollutants that may reach targetorganisms when sewage sludge surface disposal site is the method of disposal.When the models are completed, the Agency will make them available forpublic review and comment. The following discussion provides an overview of the concepts EPA usedin developing the models. In this discussion and in other parts of thepreamble, EPA points out particular areas of uncertainty on which the Agencywould like the public to focus its attention and comments. Full descriptionsof the models are presented in the Technical Support Documents preparedin conjunction with today's proposal (Reference numbers 56, 57, and 58).During the comment period, EPA will solicit the assistance of experts inthe review of the scientific and technical bases of the proposal. The expertsmay include the Agency's Science Advisory Board, the W-170 Committee, representativesof academia, and/or scientific/technical bodies with expertise in the areascovered by this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Application Of Sewage Sludge To Agricultural Lands </ITAG>To determine the concentration of a pollutant reaching a target organismwhen sewage sludge is used in the production of agricultural commodities,the mathematical models consider the likely exposure to the target organismfrom soil, food, air, surface water, and ground water. The pathways includedin the model are identified in Table IV-1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table IV-</T4>1._<T4>Pathways Modeled for the Land Application of Sewage Sludge</T4><H1>Pathways</H1><H1>Description</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1: Sludge-soil-plant-human<D>Consumers in regions heavily affected by landspreading of sludge.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1F: Sludge-soil-plant-human<D>Farnland converted to residential home garden use in 5 years.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2F: Sludge-soil-human<D>Farmland converted to residential use in 5 years with children ingestingsoil.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3: Sludge-soil-plant-animals-human<D>Farm households producing a major portion of their dietary consumptionof animal products on sludge-amended soil.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4: Sludge-soil-animal<D>Farm households consuming livestock that ingests soil while grazing.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5: Sludge-soil-plant-animal<D>Livestock ingesting food or feed crops.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6: Sludge-soil-animal<D>Grazing livestock ingesting soil.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7: Sludge-soil-plant<D>Crops grown on sludge-amended soil.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8: Sludge-soil-soil biota<D>Soil biota living in sludge-amended soil.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9: Sludge-soil-soil biota-predator<D>Animals eating soil biota.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10: Sludge-soil-airborne dust-human<D>Tractor operator exposed to dust.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">11: Sludge-soil-surface water<D>Water Quality Criteria for the receiving water.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12A: Sludge-soil-air-human<D>Farm households breathing fumes from any volatile pollutants in sludge.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12W: Sludge-soil-ground water-human<D>Farm households drinking water from wells.</D></ITAG></ITAG>In assessing the amount of pollutant exposure that an individual receivesfrom food, the Agency assumed that the MEI obtains a substantial portionof his diet from agricultural crops that are grown or from animals thatare raised on sludge-amended soils. Approximately 2.5 percent, on an average,of the MEI's vegetables, grains, and animal products is assumed to be raisedon sludge-amended soils depending on the pathway. This compares to the0.025 percent for an average American consumer. In assessing the amountof pollutant exposure from inhalation and from ingestion of water or soil,the Agency assumed the MEI resides on the property receiving the sludge.All pathways were evaluated for at least some of the pollutants in TableIII-4. Limitations in available data prevented the Agency from evaluatingeach pollutant in every pathway. ``The Technical Support Document for LandApplication'' (Reference Number 57) includes a matrix that shows the pollutantloading rates for each pathway. That pathway for a pollutant which resultsin the most stringent numerical limits is the pathway selected by the Agencyfor assessing the exposure to the MEI and for establishing the proposednumerical limits. That pathway is referred to as the ``critical pathway''.All pathways, except those involving ground water and air (Pathways 12Wand 12A), assume the mixing of sludge with 15 centimeters (i.e., 6-inchplow depth) of the surface soil layer (having a mass of 2 million kilogramsper hectare). This allows conversions between pollutant concentrationsin soil (in mass of contaminant per unit mass of soil) and pollutant loadingsrate (in mass of contaminant per hectare of land).After first determining the pollutant concentration in the soil that wouldbe allowed (i.e., the maximum pollutant concentration in the soil that,when taken up by a plant and eaten, does not produce undue risk) for aparticular pathway, the model determines the allowable pollutant loadinglimit in one of two ways. For metals, the model determines the cumulativepollutant loading limit, the total quantity of metal consistent with noundue risk. This equals the allowable pollutants concentration in the soilmultiplied by the mass of the soil in the top 15 centimeters of a hectareof land. The Agency assumed that metals remain in the sludge-soil matrixand that, over time, metals do not become more biologically available toplants.For organics, the model determines an annual pollutant loading limit (inkilograms per hectare per year) by considering the rate of loss or decay.The model assumes that the quantity of an organic pollutant lost per yearis directly proportional to the quantity present. With steady annual applications,the concentration of a pollutant gradually approaches a plateau at whichthe quantity lost each year equals the quantity applied. The annual pollutantloading rate is determined such that the concentration levels off at theallowable soil concentration when sewage sludge is applied over a longperiod of time.For the plant toxicity and soil biota pathways (Pathways 7 and 8), theAgency specified an allowable pollutant concentration in the soil, whichis the concentration that will not cause plant and soil biota toxicity.This value was derived from scientific data relating plant and soil biotatoxicity to soil contaminant levels. Thus, the allowable pollutant loadfor these pathways is that load which, after dilution with 15 centimetersof soil, does not exceed the threshold value.For the pathways intended to protect livestock from toxicity (Pathways5 and 6), the Agency evaluated livestock toxicity data to estimate themaximum allowable pollutant concentration in the feed or sludge-soil mixturethat would not be toxic to an animal. Livestock includes all herbivoresfound in the agricultural or forest setting, including domesticated grazinganimals, birds, rodents, etc. The Agency assumed that the livestock onlyconsumed feed grown on sludge-amended pastures. In the pathway involvingthe uptake of a pollutant from the soil into the feed crop (Pathway 5),the allowable pollutant concentration in the soil is the quotient of theallowable pollutant concentration in the feed and the estimated plant uptakefactor (partition coefficient).In the pathway involving direct ingestion of the contaminated soil by ananimal (Pathway 6), eight percent of the animal's diet is assumed to besludge-amended soil that is incidentaly ingested by livestock while grazing.Here, the allowable pollutant concentration in the soil is the allowablefeed concentration divided by the fraction of the diet that is soil.For the pathway involving predators of soil biota (Pathway 9), the Agencyevaluated toxicity data to estimate a pollutant concentration in soil biotathat would not be toxic to birds. For this pathway, the predator's dietis assumed to be composed entirely of soil biota from the sludge-amendedsoil. The allowable pollutant concentration in the soil is the quotientof the allowable pollutant concentration in soil biota and an estimatedsoil biota uptake factor (or partition coefficient).The surface run-off pathway (Pathway 11) is intended to protect beneficialuse of surface waters by determining the pollutant concentration in thesoil that would not exceed a Water Quality Criterion for a pollutant ifthe soil enters a relatively small stream. The rate at which the soil entersthe stream is based on the Universal Soil Loss Equation and a sedimentdelivery ratio. Water Quality Criteria are designed to protect human health,assuming exposure through consumption or drinking water and resident fish,and to protect aquatic life. The pathway was not a critical pathway andtherefore was not used as a basis of the numerical limits for any of thepollutants.In contrast to the pathways described above, the majority of the pathwaysare intended to protect only human health. These include Pathways 1F, 2F,3, 4, 10, 12A, and 12W, which are discussed below in ascending order ofcomplexity.Pathway 10 evaluates the potential for adverse effects from dust inhalationby a tractor driver during tillage operations. The pollutant concentrationin the soil is not permitted to exceed the National Institute of OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH) workplace air quality criteria if significantquantities of soil become airborne. Using the assumption that the totalairborne dust does not exceed the NIOSH criterion, this pathway is nota limiting pathway for any pollutant.The dust inhalation pathway is the only pathway that uses NIOSH criteria.For all other human exposure pathways, the maximum allowable intake isbased on the following EPA health effects criteria: a reference does (RfD)for non-carcinogens; a risk specific dose for carcinogens; a daily dietaryintake derived from the drinking water standard; or a drinking water standard(maximum contaminant level_MCL).The Agency evaluated the inadvertent ingestion of soil by children in Pathway2F. It is assumed that children would come into contact with the sludge-amendedsoil when the land was converted to residential use 5 years after the finalapplication of sludge. It is also assumed that a sludge-soil mixture isingested at a rate of 0.1 gram per day for 5 years. The allowable pollutantconcentration in the soil is the quotient rate of pollutant ingestion thatwill not adversely affect a child and the rate of soil ingestion.The Agency evaluated human exposure from the consumption of plants grownon sludged-amended soil in Pathways 1 and 1F. Both pathways determine anallowable pollutant concentration in the soil based on (1) the allowableintake; (2) an individual's typical daily consumption of several classesof sludge-grown vegetables, legumes, and grains; (3) the fraction of differentcrops assumed to be grown on sludge-amended soil; and (4) the uptake ofa pollutant by each class of crop (uptake coefficient). Pathway 1 is intendedto correspond to the exposure of a consumer in a region where sludge isused widely in the production of agricultural crops. It assumes that 2.5percent of a consumer's intake of grains, vegetables, potatoes, legumes,and garden fruits comes from sludge-amended soil. Pathway 1F involves ahome garden scenario, with as much as 60 percent of a consumer's intakecoming from grains, vegetables, and potatoes grown on sludge-amended soil.It is assumed that the agricultural land is converted to residential homegarden use 5 years after the final application of sludge. Essentially thesame partitioning of a pollutant between soil and crop is used for bothpathways. The numerical results of modeling these pathways indicate thatthe home garden pathway (1F) results in more stringent numerical limitsthan the regional consumer pathway (1) for all pollutants evaluated.The Agency evaluated human exposure from the consumption of animal productsin Pathways 3 and 4. Both assume that approximately 40 percent of the meat,dairy products, and eggs consumed by a farm household is produced on sludge-amendedsoil.The first animal product pathway (Pathway 3) assumes that the pollutantreaches the animal through feed crops. The allowable pollutant concentrationin the soil is the quotient of the allowable pollutant concentration inthe feed crop and a crop uptake factor (partition coefficient). The allowablepollutant concentration in the feed crop is determined from (1) the humanintake that can be allowed without causing undue risk, (2) typical consumptionrates of various classes of animal products, (3) the percentage of eachclass of animal product assumed to be raised on sludge-amended soil, and(4) a set of uptake factors relating the pollutant concentration in eachanimal product to the pollutant concentration in the feed consumed by theanimal.The other animal product pathway (Pathway 4) only involves animals thatgraze. This pathway assumes that eight percent of the grazing animal'sdiet consists of a sludge-soil mixture. The allowable pollutant concentrationin the soil is the allowable feed concentration divided by the fractionof the animal's diet that is sludge-amended soil. The allowable feed concentrationis determined as in Pathway 3, with some differences in the fraction ofeach food class assumed to be grown on sludge-amended soil.In model Pathway 12A, the Agency evaluated the exposure of a farm householdinhaling vapors of any volatile pollutants that may be in the sludge whenit is applied to the land. This pathway is considered for six chemicals:benzo(a)pyrene, bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, chlordane, DDT, dimethylnitrosamine,and polychlorinated biphenyls. The Agency did not apply the vapor pathwayto benzene, lindane, trichloroethylene, or toxaphene because these chemicalswould volatilize in wastewater treatment processes before sludge disposal_eitherduring wastewater aeration or during sludge processing and de-watering.In addition, the vapor pathway was not applied to relatively non-volatilemetals.The vapor pathway assumes that the total amount of chemical spread in eachyear would vaporize during that year. Thus, the allowable annual pollutantloading rate is equal to the flux (mass of chemical per unit area per unittime) that may be allowed to enter the atmosphere without exceeding theallowable pollutant concentration in the air. This concentration correspondsto the RfD, risk specific dose, or an MCL. A plume model is used to relatethe flux to the resulting pollutant concentration in the air. The allowableflux is determined by (1) the allowable pollutant concentration in theair, (2) the size of the sludge application site, (3) the assumed distanceof an individual from the site where the air concentration must be attained,(4) the wind speed, and (5) the degree of atmospheric mixing. The winddirection is assumed never to change, so that the MEI always remains inthe center line of the plume.In model Pathway 12W, the Agency evaluated the exposure of individualswho would obtain their drinking water from ground water located directlybelow a field to which sludge had been applied. The leachate concentrationformed in the sludge-amended soil layer is related by a partition coefficientto the pollutant concentration in the soil. In moving down through theunsaturated zone, the peak leachate concentration is reduced by the modeledprocesses of vertical dispersion (primarily caused by detention of sorbedpollutant), chemical degradation, and metal precipitation. The unsaturatedzone transport model, CHAIN, and (for metals) the geochemical model, MINTEQ,are used here. These models are described more fully in the section onmonofill models.The allowable pollutant loading rate is thus determined from the MCL (thatmust be met at the ground water interface with no allowance for dilution),the rate of decay of a pollutant, and other factors that affect eitherthe time period for decay or the dispersive smoothing of the peak concentration.These other factors include the recharge or infiltration rate, hydrauliccharacteristics of the soil, depth to ground water, and the chemical partitioncoefficient. For some metals, the net ground water electromotive potential(Eh) and ground water pH influence precipitation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Distribution and Marketing</ITAG>The Agency derived the numerical limits for the distribution and marketing(Dandamp;M) of sewage sludge in a manner analogous to land application. Fewerpathways were considered, however, because the Agency assumed that animalswould not be raised on the sludge-amended soil and that the sludge-amendedarea would not be large enough to affect ground water or the air abovethe site. The pathways evaluated are shown in Table IV-2, and were describedin the previous section.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table IV-</T4>2._<T4>Pathways Modeled for D</T4>andamp;<T4>M</T4><H1>Pathway</H1><H1>Description</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1: Sludge-soil-plant-human <D>Residential home garden.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2: Sludge-soil-human <D>Child's indigestion of soil.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7: Sludge-soil-plant <D>Phytotoxicity.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8: Sludge-soil-soil biota <D>Soil biota toxicity.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9: Sludge-soil-soil biota-predator <D>Animals eating soil biota.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">11: Sludge-soil-surface water <D>Water quality criteria for the receiving water.</D></ITAG></ITAG>For metals, the Dandamp;M pollutant loading limits are identical to the landapplication rates for the human exposure pathways involving home gardencrops and soil consumption (i.e., Dandamp;M Pathways 1 and 2 are identicalto previously described land application Pathways 1F and 2F, respectively).For organics, the limits for these pathways are slightly more stringentin Dandamp;M than in land application because Dandamp;M assumes immediate residentialuse whereas in land application there is a 5-year period between the finalsludge application and residential use, allowing for the decay of organicpollutants.The Dandamp;M model pathways evaluating plant toxicity, soil biota, and avianpredators (Pathways 7, 8, and 9, respectively) are identical to the correspondingland application pathways for all pollutants. The Dandamp;M model algorithmfor surface runoff (Pathway 11) produced slightly less stringent limitsthan land application because of minor differences in assumptions aboutthe size of the affected area.<ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Uncertainties and Issues in the Exposure Assessment Modelsfor Land Application and Dandamp;M</ITAG>The models used in assessing the risks and in developing the proposed limitsfor the land application of sludge involve a number of uncertainties andtechnical issues. The land application model is a complex model made upof a large number of pathways and parameters. This section identifies thekey technical points, parameters, and assumptions on which the Agency isparticularly interested in receiving comment. The ``Technical Support Documenton Land Application'' (Reference number 57) contains a detailed discussionof the derivation of the model assumptions and parameter values. A moredetailed discussion of many uncertainties in the modeling framework canbe found in the comments of the SAB. Table IV-3 indicates the land applicationand Dandamp;M model parameters and assumptions that the Agency believes aremost important and therefore most worthy of public review and comment.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table IV-</T4>3<T4> Key Parameters And Assumptions for Agricultural Land Application AndD andamp; M Pathways</T4><H1>Pathway \1\</H1><H1>Pollutants of greatest concern \1\</H1><H1>Key parameters and assumptions</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1 Sludge-Soil-Plant-Human<D>None</D><D>None.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1F Sludge-Soil-Plant-Human<D>Cd \1\; possibly HCB, Pb</D><D>Plant uptake; assume metal bioavailability unchanging over time; organicpollutant's decay rate and time period for decay; percentage of diet affected;toxicity to humans.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2F Sludge-Soil-Human<D>None</D><D>Soil ingestion rates.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 Sludge-Soil-Plant-Animal-Human<D>HCB \1\; possibly DDT \1\, PCB \1\, Toxaphene</D><D>Plant uptake; organic pollutant's rate; percentage of diet affected;toxicity to humans.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4 Sludge-Soil-Animal-Human<D>None</D><D>Mixing with 15 cm soil.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5 Sludge-Soil-Plant-Animal<D>Se \1\, Mo \1\, Cd, Zn</D><D>Plant uptake; assume metal bioavailability unchanging over time; background(Mo) concentration in feed; toxicity to livestock.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6 Sludge-Soil-Animal<D>None</D><D>Mixing with 15 cm soil.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7 Sludge-Soil-Plant<D>Cu \1\, Zn \1\, Ni \1\</D><D>Background soil concentration assumes metal bioavailability unchangingover time; toxicity to plants.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8 Sludge-Soil-Soil Biota<D>Cu</D><D>Toxicity to soil invertebrates.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9 Sludge-Soil-Soil Biota-Predator<D>Pb \1\, Zn; possibly Aldrin/Dieldrin \1\</D><D>Uptake rate in soil invertebrates; assume metal bioavailability unchangingover time; toxicity to birds.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10 Sludge-Soil-Airborne Dust-Human<D>None</D><D>None.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">11 Sludge-Soil-Surface Water<D>None</D><D>None.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12A Sludge-Soil-Air-Human<D>Possibly BaP \1\, BEHP \1\, Diethylnitrosamine \1\</D><D>Assume volatilization more rapid than decay or leaching; wind speedand atmospheric mixing; assume wind direction unchanging; toxicity to humans.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12W Sludge-Soil Ground Water-Human<D>Cd, TCE \1\; possibly Toxaphene \1\</D><D>Partition coefficient; organic pollutant's decay rate; soil type; depthto ground water; ground water; ground water Eh, pH; toxicity to humans.</D><F>\1\ Indicates critical pathway for that pollutant.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Reasonable Worst-Case Assumptions And Parameter ValuesAs discussed elsewhere in the preamble, the numerical limits are intendedto protect individuals, plants, and animals from ``reasonably anticipatedadverse effects of each pollutant''. In some cases, the value for a parameteris based on a worst or a near-worst combination of values (e.g., the toxicityvalues for plants and animals). In other cases, the value is an averageor median value (e.g., the assumed background level of metals in the soil).Stringing together a long series of worst-case parameters and assumptionsis not appropriate because there is no reasonable expectation that allworst-case conditions would occur simultaneously in any real situation.It is likewise inappropriate to use only average values since a significantportion of real situations are likely to be worse. Although EPA believesthat the proposed models build in an appropriate degree of protection,the Agency is particularly interested in receiving comments on the parametervalues used for land application and Dandamp;M, especially the plant andanimal toxicity values. These values have not been peer reviewed for usein the model. In addition, the Agency is soliciting comments on its assumptionsabout the rate at which crops absorb a pollutant, soil pH, and backgroundmetal concentration.Soil IncorporationThe Agency assumed that the sludge is incorporated into the top 15 centimetersof the soil. For pathways involving plant absorption of a pollutant, theactual depth of soil incorporation should make relatively little difference,since the mean concentration in the root zone is likely to be more importantthan the distribution of the pollutant within the root zone. However, forpathways involving direct ingestion of soil, the assumed depth of incorporationhas greater importance, as discussed later.Background Metals In SoilFor metals, the Agency used an estimated nationwide median concentrationfor agricultural lands as the background level of metals in soil. In somecases, the background concentration of a metal is a significant fractionof the maximum allowable soil concentration.The ability of plants to absorb metals in the soil was assumed to be thesame as their ability to absorb metals in sewage sludge. If higher backgroundconcentrations of metals were assumed, those numerical limits based onplant toxicity would be more stringent for copper, zinc, and nickel. However,in some cases, the higher background concentrations of metals would exceedthe allowable pollutant concentration in the soil. The Agency is solicitingadditional data and information on the background concentration of metalsassociated with agricultural soils.Behavior of Metals For the terrestrial Pathways 1-9, the Agency assumed that once the metalis applied, it remains on the land indefinitely. No accounting is madefor removal by (1) soil erosion, (2) leaching, (3) volatilization, or (4)absorption of the plant and removal of the harvested portion of the plant.The half-life of the upper 15 centimeters of soil is generally on the orderof a century. Most metals are expected to leach out of the top 15 centimetersof soil more slowly than they erode from the site. However, the Agencyhas not evaluated whether this would also be true in the case of seleniumand molybdenum. The Agency has not evaluated the losses of metals throughvolatilization or through crop harvesting. Thus, EPA is uncertain if itsassumption that metals remain on the land would make a significant differencein the numerical limits included in today's proposal. The Agency is muchmore concerned, however, about the potential error in its assumption thatthe biological availability of metals does not change over time. Whilethe Agency believes that bioavailability may decrease over time, the Agencydid not consider its data adequate to determine the extent of such a decreaseand, consequently, did not include this as a modeled factor.Behavior of Organic Contaminants For organic pollutants, the model calculates an annual pollutant loadingrate (in kilograms per hectare, per year_kg/ha/yr). The allowable annualpollutant loading rate is the loading rate that just balances the decayrate of the pollutant (in kg/ha/yr) when the concentration of a pollutantin the soil reaches the allowable pollutant concentration in the soil forthe pollutant. Once this balance is achieved, land application may be carriedout indefinitely without exceeding the allowable pollutant concentrationin the soil. Therefore, the decay rate coefficient for an organic pollutantis a key parameter in determining the allowable annual loading rate forthat pollutant. The effect of decay is to reduce the overall amount ofthe pollutant in the soil. If a high decay rate is assumed, the allowableannual pollutant loading rate is higher than if a low decay rate is assumed.The time period over which sludge is applied to the land is usually notimportant to the allowable pollutant loading rate, particularly if sludgeis applied for more than 10 to 15 years. However, when the Agency estimatesa zero decay rate, as it did for DDT, the assumed time period (which variesby pathway) is important in severely limiting the allowable pollutant loadingrate.Uptake by Plants In calculating the numerical limits, the Agency assumed that the pollutantconcentration in crops is linearly related to the pollutant concentrationin soil. There is some evidence that pollutant concentrations in cropsmay tend to level off with repeated sludge applications. EPA's theoreticalframework for modeling plant uptake included equations for both linearand non-linear uptake. Although non-linear uptake is considered more realistic,EPA only used linear uptake factors because the Agency lacks sufficientdata to generate nonlinear uptake curves. The Agency is soliciting datathat could be used in determining the appropriate shape of plant uptakecurves.Ingestion of Soil by Animals Ingestion of soil by animals is considered in Pathways 4 and 6, for landapplication. EPA assumed that a relatively large amount of soil would beingested by grazing animals (around eight percent of the diet), althoughhigher values have sometimes been reported. The Agency is uncertain ifthe value used is appropriate for long-term exposure and is, thus, seekingcomment. The Agency is also seeking comment on the assumed dilution of sludge with15 centimeters of soil when the sludge is applied to pastures. Since thesludge applied to pastures is not incorporated into the soil (as it isfor row crops), our assumption relies on climatic conditions and biologicalfactors to assure mixing to the 15-centimeter depth. When grazing, animalsoften pull up shallow roots with the foliage. If the sludge has not beenmixed thoroughly with the soil, grazing animals may ingest greater concentrationsof a pollutant than those assumed in the model. Consequently, the Agencyis considering depths of less than 15 centimeters in the model for pasturesand seeks public comment on the appropriate depth that the Agency shoulduse in calculating pollutant limits.Ingestion of Soil by Humans Ingestion of soil by young children is evaluated in Pathway 2 for bothland application and Dandamp;M. The Agency assumed the quantity of soil ingestedby children to be 0.1 gram per day. The Agency considers this to be a goodestimate of the mean value (Reference number 22). Because all studies ofsoil ingestion by children are short-term measurements, there is no wayto estimate (long-term) time-average soil ingestion by a child either withPICA behavior or who inadvertently ingests soil. The observed variabilitybetween children overstates the true variability of long-term exposure.While the use of an average soil ingestion rate, rather than the use ofan ingestion rate associated with a PICA child (0.5-5.0 grams per day)might be construed as under-protective, other factors suggest that theAgency's analysis may be over-protective. First, the entire 0.1 gram ofsoil ingested per day was assumed to be composed of sludge-amended soil.In real situations, only a portion of the 0.1 gram per day is likely tobe from sludge-amended soil. Second, it is unlikely that a child wouldingest 0.1 gram of a sludge-soil mixture every day. Third, and possiblymost important, the biological availability of sludge-soil-bound pollutantswas assumed to be equal to that of the pollutants in food and drinkingwater. There is evidence that desorption from the soil particles is a veryslow process, generally requiring more time than available to materialthat is traversing the alimentary canal. Such desorption would have totake place before the contaminant could cross the membranes into the bloodstream.The modeling assumes dilution of the sludge with 15 centimeters soil. EPAhas not specifically evaluated the long-term ingestion of pure sludge becausethe Agency believes that the sludge and soil will be mixed together bynatural weathering processes. Therefore, long-term ingestion of 0.1 gramof pure sludge per day is not a reasonable expectation.Animal Uptake From Feed and Forage CropsThe Agency considered the uptake of pollutants by herbivorous animals fromfeed or forage (grown on sludge-amended soil) in Pathways 3 and 5 for landapplication only. The Agency assumed that the pollutant concentration inanimal tissues is a linear function of the concentration in the feed, thatthe animals feed solely on crops or forage grown on sludge-amended soil,and that the bioavailability of the pollutant in the feed is the same asthe pure pollutant. EPA is requesting comment on the appropriateness ofthe values used for the uptake of pollutants by herbivores.Human Exposure From DietThe quantity of each of eight food groups in the human diet assumed inthe analysis is taken from the Pennington data base for the age and gendergroup with the highest daily consumption (Reference number 28). While theassumed diet contains an average mix of meat, fruits, legumes, grains,dairy products, etc., the consumption rates are higher than would be expectedfor a single individual over a lifetime.Assumptions about diet composition affect pathways differently. A moreherbivorous diet would produce greater adverse effects for Pathway 1 (exposurethrough plants), but less stringent effects in Pathways 3 and 4 (exposurethrough meat and animal products). A more carnivorous diet would producethe opposite effect.For today's proposal, the Agency has used the Pennington data base ratherthan the Tolerance Assessment System (TAS) data base used in pesticideregistration actions for calculating the percentage of different food groupsin the average adult's diet. The data used to support today's proposalresult in slightly more stringent numerical limits than would the TAS diet.The Agency is considering use of the TAS system data base in calculatingthe numerical limits in any re-evaluation of today's proposal and in futurerulemakings.More important than the diet composition, however, is the assumption aboutthe percentage of diet from sludge-amended soil. Pathway 1F for land applicationand Pathway 1 of Dandamp;M involve home garden scenarios. They assume thatnearly 60 percent of an individual's lifetime consumption of grains, potatoes,and vegetables is grown on sludge-amended soil. The Agency has some datato support the amount of potatoes and vegetables grown in home gardens,but has little data to support the amount of grain grown in home gardens.The Agency is requesting comment on the percentage of home grown food inan MEI's diet.Land application Pathways 3 and 4 involve scenarios of farm householdsconsuming, over a long period of time, 40 percent of their own meat andanimal products raised on sludge-amended soil. The Agency is requestingcomment on the appropriateness of this assumption.Plant and Animal ToxicityThe toxicity of pollutants (particularly metals) to plants and animals,based on Pathways 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, plays a key role in setting numericallimits. The derivation of the toxicity thresholds for these pathways arediscussed in Part VIII of the preamble. Comments on these thresholds wouldbe particularly valuable.Exposure to Contaminant VaporsPathway 12 contains two pathways, ground water ingestion and vapor inhalation.The sum of exposures to the MEI from both routes is not permitted to exceedan exposure equivalent to a MCL, a RfD, or a risk-specific dose.The vapor pathway assumes that the entire quantity of pollutant appliedto the land is vaporized during the ensuing year. This assumption simplifiesthe analyses and avoids the need to predict the vaporization rate, a processlikely to be controlled by the rate of pollutant diffusion through thesoil. The Agency has no evidence to support the assumption that certainpollutants are vaporized within a year. Indeed, its suspects that the truerate would be significantly lower. The Agency is requesting comment onthe assumed rate of vaporization, particularly for benzo(a)pyrene, bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate,and dimethylnitrosamine. The Agency is also soliciting comment on its decisionnot to evaluate the vaporization of benzene, lindane, toxaphene, and trichloroethylene.Once vaporized, the downwind pollutant concentrations are predicted witha plume model. The MEI is assumed always to remain at the centerline ofthe plume. Parameter values for wind speed and atmospheric mixing are thosefor the worst combination of circumstances. Consequently, the Agency isuncertain if the construct of the model or the parameter values used inthe model are appropriate for assessing long-term exposure.Ground WaterThe ground water model was operated to determine the cumulative load ofeach pollutant that could be applied to the land without causing the leachateto exceed the MCL (or allowable drinking water concentration) at the interfacewith the saturated zone or water table. As long as the metal's cumulativelimit is not exceeded, the leachate at the ground water interface willnot exceed the MCL, whether the entire load is applied at once or spreadout over many years. Theoretically, the calculated cumulative limit forthis pathway should be valid for a few decades (for the more soluble metals)and up to several centuries (for the less soluble metals). Beyond thistime period, however, the cumulative limit could be exceeded without causingthe leachate to exceed the MCL, if the pollutant were applied at extremelylow rates.The modeled scenario couples a permeable, sandy loam soil, low in naturalorganic matter, with a high water table that is one meter below the surface.The Agency is uncertain whether such a scenario is reasonable.For both metals and organics, one of the key chemical parameters is thepartition coefficient (the metal concentration in soil solids divided bythe metal concentration in the liquid at equilibrium). The partition coefficientsfor the metals were rather low compared to other partition coefficientsthat have been used previously (Reference numbers 10 and 18). Despite theselow partition coefficients, however, metal limits for this pathway do notrestrict the land application of sludge.For organics, the other key chemical parameter is the decay rate coefficient.The Agency estimated the decay coefficient for trichloroethylene to bezero. Although trichloroethylene is expected to decay, there is evidencethat a major product would be stable vinyl chloride. Vinyl chloride hasthe same risk as trichloroethylene.<ITAG tagnum="84">Monofills</ITAG>EPA evaluated two exposure pathways for sludge monofills: (1) Pollutantinfiltration to ground water and subsequent ingestion from drinking water,and (2) vaporization from the fill material and subsequent inhalation.The analysis considers the long-term exposure that an MEI would receivefrom drinking two liters of ground water per day and from inhaling 20 cubicmeters of air per day at the property boundary of the monofill. The Agencycalculated the combined water and air exposure to the MEI and comparedthe combined exposure to a MCL, RfD, or risk specific dose. As describedbelow, the analytical framework for the ground water model has four components:(1) A calculation of contaminated leachate pulse duration, (2) a modelof pollutant behavior and movement in the unsaturated zone, (3) an evaluationof metal solubility in ground water, and (4) a model of pollutant behaviorand movement in the saturated zone.The analysis begins with assumptions on the monofill size and fill thickness,the pollutant concentrations in the sludge, the pollutant concentrationsin the leachate, and the net recharge (infiltration) rate. The durationof time, T (years), over which the fill releases a metal pollutant to unsaturatedzone (leachate pulse duration) is then calculated from the following factors:the metal concentration in sludge, CS (milligrams per kilogram); the sludgesolids content, SS (kilograms per liter); the fill thickness, D (meters);the assumed leachate concentration, CL (milligrams per liter); the ground-waterrecharge rate, R (meters per year); and the excess liquid in the originalsludge volume, EL (liters per liter). The result is:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L0,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,s10</C> <H1>T = ((CS andmultiply; SS/CL) ^ EL andmultiply; D/R</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>The EL term merely adjusts the recharge water budget for excess water inthe sludge. For degradable organic pollutants, the above calculation ismodified to account for the rate of decay within the fill, as describedin the support documents (Reference numbers 58 and 66).The above calculation of the leachate pulse duration assumes that CL remainsconstant over time until the sludge is completely depleted of the pollutant,thereby modeling the leachate pulse as a mathematical square wave. Forany particular organic pollutant, the leachate concentration is determinedby a solid/liquid partition coefficient and the concentration CS, in thesludge.The leachate pulse is then used in the unsaturated zone model, CHAIN (Referencenumber 61). CHAIN assumes a steady rate of percolation through the unsaturatedzone and calculates the concentrations in the leachate as affected by sorptionto the underlying soil and decay (of organic pollutants). The effect ofsorption is to retard the movement of the pollutant through the soil profileand to elongate and flatten out the leachate pulse, thereby reducing thepeak concentration. For both metals and organics, sorption to soil is determinedby a solid/liquid partition coefficient. The effect of decay is to reducethe overall amount of pollutant in the leachate. For organic compounds,decay includes the processes of hydrolysis and anaerobic biodegradation.In evaluating exposure to the MEI, the depth to ground water is assumedto be zero over Class I ground water and one meter over Class II and ClassIII ground water. The definitions of Class I, Class II, and Class III groundwater are explained in Part IX of the preamble. CHAIN is bypassed in assessingexposure to an MEI for monofills located over Class I ground water, butis used for assessing exposure to an MEI when a monofill is located overClass II or Class III ground water. At the bottom of the unsaturated zone, the peak concentrations of metalsin the leachate pulse, attenuated as calculated by CHAIN (where applicable),are then adjusted for solubility constraints, based on the calculationsof MINTEQ (Reference number 13). The model does not actually operate theMINTEQ code, but rather incorporates the results of previous runs of MINTEQat various conditions of pH and Eh. The MINTEQ solubility adjustments areapplied only to the six metals (arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury,and nickel). At the low pH and high Eh used in the exposure assessmentanalysis, MINTEQ predicts that copper would be the only metal to precipitatein amounts that would reduce greatly the ground-water concentration. The flux of pollutants entering the aquifer in the area beneath the monofillis then input (as a square wave at the peak concentration) to the saturatedzone fate and transport model, AT123D (Reference number 65). This modelcalculates the behavior and movement of the contaminant plume, as affectedby advection (ground water flow), diffusion and dispersion (mixing), sorption,decay, and distance from the sewage sludge unit to the property boundaryof the monofill or 150 meters (whichever is less). For Class II and ClassIII ground water, the MCL must be met at the property boundary of the monofillor 150 meters, whichever is less. The effect of diffusion and dispersionis to spread the contaminant plume vertically and horizontally, therebyfurther reducing the peak concentration. AT123D is only operated for ClassII and Class III aquifers. In Class I aquifers, the leachate must meetthe MCL upon entry to the aquifer. The components of the model (leachate pulse_CHAIN_MINTEQ_AT123D) are operatedin an iterative trial and error mode to determine the sludge concentrationthat produces a peak concentration equal to the MCL at the point of compliance.The Agency evaluated exposure to pollutant vapors even though de-wateredmunicipal sludge is unlikely to contain significant quantities of highlyvolatile material. Most volatile pollutants would vaporize before sludgedisposal, particularly during wastewater aeration or during sludge dewatering.The model used here (Reference number 67) has two components: (1) Calculationof the flux of volatile pollutants into the atmosphere, and (2) determinationof the peak air concentration at the property boundary. The model is formulated so that the vaporization flux depends on the initialconcentration of a pollutant in the sludge and on the monofill's covermaterial. During the time the wastes are assumed to be uncovered, the rateof vaporization is controlled by the rate of diffusion into the air (asopposed to diffusion up through the sludge). The flux is thus formulatedto depend primarily on the wind speed and Henry's Law constant (concentrationof the pollutant in air divided by the concentration of the pollutant inwater, at equilibrium). During the time that the fill is temporarily or permanently covered, therate of vaporization is formulated to depend on the rate of diffusion upthrough air-filled pores in the cover material. The rate thus depends primarilyon the cover material's porosity and thickness and on the Henry's Law constant.The mean flux from the monofill is determined by considering the areasof the monofill expected to be uncovered and temporarily or permanentlycovered at any time, as described in the ``Technical Support Document forLandfills'' (Reference number 58). The concentration at the centerline of a plume downwind of the monofilldepends on the size of the monofill, the distance to the point of complianceat the property boundary, the wind speed, and the degree of atmosphericmixing. The wind direction is assumed never to change, so that the MEIalways remains in the centerline of the plume. The predicted vapor exposure is combined with the predicted drinking waterexposure and then compared to the exposure allowed by the MCL, RfD, orrisk specific dose. Technical Uncertainties and Issues in the Analysis of MonofillsThere are a number of uncertainties and issues in modeling the exposureof an MEI to the pollutants in sewage sludge that is placed in a monofill.The modeling involved is relatively complicated, and the validity of someof the model's assumptions and parameter values is uncertain. For the twopathways that the Agency has modeled, Table IV-4 presents the most significantassumptions and parameters.The Agency's SAB has questioned several aspects of the modeling frameworkand suggested it may result in unrealistic over-estimates of exposure andmore stringent numerical limitations than necessary. The Agency is solicitingcomment on the modeling framework and the parameter values used in themodel.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,r50,r200</C><T4>Table </T4>IV-4._<T4>Key Parameters and Assumptions for Monofilling</T4><H1>Pollutants of pathway</H1><H1>Greatest concern</H1><H1>Key parameters and assumptions for pollutants of concern</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Ground water<D>As, Cd, Pb, Benzene, BEHP, TCE</D><D>Assume all pollutants are leachable.</D><P>Assume metal's leachate concentration independent of sludge concentration.</P><P>Partition coefficient.</P><P>Organic pollutant's decay rate.</P><P>Soil type.</P><P>Depth to ground water.</P><P>Assume square wave input to ground water.</P><P>Ground water Eh, pH.</P><P>Distance to fenceline.</P><P>Drinking water MCL.</P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vapor<D>Diethyl nitrosamine, BEHP</D><D>Assume vaporization controlled by atmospheric diffusion for unburiedfill and by pore diffusion for buried fill.</D><P>Assume vaporization unimpeded by sorption or decay.</P><P>Henry's Law constant.</P><P>Wind speed and atmospheric mixing.</P><P>Assume wind direction unchanging.</P><P>Allowable air concentration.</P></ITAG></ITAG>Pathways ConsideredFour pathways of exposure to the MEI from monofilled pollutants were originallyconsidered: (1) Drinking of ground water containing pollutants that leachedfrom the monofill, (2) inhalation of vapors, (3) inhalation of particlessuspended from the open face (unburied portion) of the fill, and (4) run-offto streams. After some preliminary analysis, the Agency found that thethird and fourth pathways were unlikely to be important.The SAB, however, suggested the movement of contaminated ground water intosurface waters as a fifth pathway. While the Agency doubts that the risksfrom such a pathway would exceed those from drinking the ground water directly,it is considering some future evaluation of the pathway.<ITAG tagnum="81">Leachate Strength Upon Exiting the Fill</ITAG>The total dry weight concentration of any pollutant in sludge (in mg/kg)can be related to the concentration of the pollutant sorbed to sludge solids,the concentration of a pollutant dissolved in the sludge liquid, and thepercent liquid contained in the whole sludge. As water percolates fromthe land surface into the sludge fill, the liquid in the sludge fill isdisplaced downward into the underlying soil as leachate. The new liquidpercolating into the fill then reaches equilibrium with the sludge solids.The Agency assumed here that all sludge pollutants will eventually be solubilizedif they are not first degraded. All sorption is thus considered to be readilyreversible. The Agency suspects, however, that the analysis may over-estimatethe mobility of pollutants in sludge and thereby over-estimate the amountof exposure.The leachate pulse leaving the fill is modeled as a square wave. Over time,the leachate flux (leaving the sludge and entering the soil) is assumedto maintain a constant value until the pollutant is depleted from the sludge,at which time the leachate flux would be zero. If the pollutant were reversiblysorbed to solids, it could be expected that, over time, the leachate concentrationflux would gradually die off to zero. Nevertheless, based on numericalsimulations, the Agency believes that a square wave flux and a graduallydying-off flux produce similar results once the leachate has traveled aboutone meter into the unsaturated zone.In calculating numerical limits, the dissolved concentration in the sludgeand in the leachate from the sludge is related to the sorbed concentrationin the sludge by a chemical partition coefficient. The Agency was not alwaysconsistent in its modeling of sorption and it intends to re-evaluate thepartition coefficients applied, particularly for metals. The Agency mayhave under-estimated the sorption of several metals to sludge and slightlyover-estimated the sorption of source organics to sludge. A more completediscussion is provided in the ``Technical Support Document For Landfills''(Reference number 58). The Class I ground water limits are most affectedby the Agency's assumptions about sorption to solids.<ITAG tagnum="81">Effect of Monofill Liners</ITAG>The Agency did not explicitly intend for the analysis to account for theeffect of liners in restricting the movement of pollutants out of the fill.The SAB recommended that the analysis consider liners, although the Agencybelieves that liners are generally not used in sewage sludge monofills.The Agency did not specifically act upon the SAB recommendation on liners.Nevetheless, the rule does allow for numerical limits to be calculatedusing site-specific values for soil type and recharge rate. The Agencyis requesting comment on whether or not this is a satisfactory means ofaccounting for the effects of liners when calculating site-specific numericallimits.<ITAG tagnum="81">Use of CHAIN</ITAG>CHAIN assumes a steady rate of water percolating down through the unsaturatedzone. This allows a relatively efficient iterative analytical solution.However, the assumption of steady flow tends to under-estimate the traveltime (and thus the amount of decay) and to over-predict the pollutant concentration.The SAB recommended the use of the unsteady flow model, PRZM, because ofits better resolution of transient events. The Agency, however, is notsure whether better resolution of transient events (although importantfor short-term analyses) has much value in the analyses of long-term exposureused in this proposal, or whether the inaccuracy introduced by CHAIN (relativeto PRZM) is significant compared to other uncertainties and inaccuraciesin the models.<ITAG tagnum="81">MINTEQ</ITAG>The model does not actually operate the MINTEQ computer code, but ratherincorporates the results from running the model at several pollutant concentrationsfor six different combinations of pH and Eh for arsenic, cadmium, copper,lead, mercury, and nickel. Other pollutants are not simulated by MINTEQ.In the six combinations of pH and Eh considered, pH has the value of either6 or 7, and Eh has the value of either ^200, +150, or +500 millivolts.The national numerical limits are based on a pH of 6 and Eh of +500. Forcase-by-case applications of the model, the Agency is uncertain if theabove ranges of pH and Eh cover the range of ground water conditions likelyto be encountered.<ITAG tagnum="81">Input to AT123D</ITAG>The concentration at the bottom of the unsaturated zone (output from CHAIN),when plotted over time, has a Gaussian-like shape (i.e., a rounded centralpeak tapering off to long tails). For input to AT123D, this smooth curveis converted to a square wave, having a concentration equal to the CHAINoutput peak concentration.The duration of this square wave is formulated to be the duration fromthat point when the concentration output from CHAIN first reaches one percentof the peak concentration, through the period of elevated concentration,until the concentration drops back to one percent of the peak. The Agencychecked this assumption and found that it injected some 2.5 times morecontaminant into ground water than the amount reaching the bottom of theunsaturated zone. For non-degrading chemicals, this also means that 2.5fold more chemical is input to ground water than was disposed of in thelandfill.The Agency believes that, to track the mass of pollutant, it may be moreaccurate for the duration of the square wave to be equal to the time betweenthe moment when the Gaussian curve first attains 10 percent of the peakand the time when it drops back to 10 percent of the peak (when convertinga Gaussian curve into a square wave having the peak concentration). TheAgency may change this aspect of the model and is soliciting comment onappropriateness of this change.<ITAG tagnum="81">Output From AT123D</ITAG>Users of this model have sometimes found anomalous results. Rather thansteadily decreasing with distance, the peak concentration predicted atvarious distances from a landfill may first increase and then decreasewith distance. The Agency is uncertain of either the reason for this anomalyor its overall significance. The Agency is requesting comment on the sourceand significance of this problem.<ITAG tagnum="81">Orientation of the Monofill With Respect to the Ground Water Flow</ITAG>For case-by-case application of the model, the Agency intends to fix theorientation of the monofill as a square monofill at the edge of the aquifer,regardless of the actual site characteristics. If the monofill area werea highly elongated shape, the orientation of the fill with respect to theground water flow would increase or decrease the ground water concentration.The Agency is soliciting comment on whether it should consider the actualorientation of the monofill in case-by-case determinations of pollutantlimits.<ITAG tagnum="81">Time-Variable Exposure</ITAG>The predicted concentrations vary over time, whether at the bottom of thesaturated zone (i.e., the compliance point for Class I ground water) orat the property boundary (or 150 meters from the sludge disposal unit_thecompliance point for Class II and Class III ground water).Since the peak concentration of a pollutant is not permitted to exceedthe allowable concentration, the model calculates a concentration thatwill not exceed an MCL at any time. For carcinogens with no MCL, the numericallimits are calculated so that the peak concentration does not exceed the70-year mean concentration corresponding to a risk specific dose. The degreeto which the peak concentration exceeds the 70-year mean concentrationdepends on how rapidly the concentration varies through time, which, inturn, depends primarily on the chemical partition coefficient and the distanceinvolved. Therefore, public comment is requested on whether the Agencyshould determine the numerical limits for carcinogens using the 70-yearmean concentration rather than the peak concentration.<ITAG tagnum="81">Vaporization Flux</ITAG>The flux of a pollutant from the monofill into the air depends on the coverover the fill. For uncovered fill, the Agency assumed that the rate limitingprocess is the diffusion rate of a pollutant from the air-sluge interfaceinto the bulk volume of the air. The Agency is uncertain that the ratelimiting process has been correctly identified. The principles set forthin some of the Agency's technical guidance (Reference numbers 10 and 21)indicate that diffusion of a volatile pollutant from within the sludgeout to the air-sludge interface should be expected to be the rate limitingprocess. If the rate limiting process were not correctly identified, thevaporization flux would be over-estimated. The Agency is requesting commenton the vaporization formulation and is particularly seeking alternativeformulations for consideration.For covered fill, the rate is formulated assuming that the rate limitingprocess is the movement of pollutant up through air-filled voids in thecover material. While the Agency believes that this is reasonable, theSAB has criticized the approach for not considering the retarding effectsof sorption and degradation. The Agency is seeking comment and will considerany alternative formulations suggested.The model does not keep a mass balance account of the total quantity ofpollutant vaporized. The model is capable of vaporizing more pollutantthan was originally placed in the monofill. In addition, the quantitiesleached to ground water include the quantities vaporized, thus resultingin some double counting of exposure. The Agency is considering modifyingthe model to correct these problems.<ITAG tagnum="81">Atmospheric Plume Modeling</ITAG>The atmospheric plume model calculates the peak concentration at the centerlineof the plume. The MEI is assumed always to remain in the centerline ofthe plume. The Agency is requested comment on the appropriateness of thisassumption and suggestions for other assumptions.The wind speed (1 meter per second) and atmospheric stability parameters(as described in Reference number 66) are intended to represent the worstcombination of conditions. While they may be appropriate for an event,the Agency is uncertain whether they are reasonable for representing long-termconditions. The Agency is soliciting recommendations for appropriate valuesfor the long-term atmospheric conditions.<ITAG tagnum="81">Model Validation</ITAG>The Agency has applied modeling approaches that it generally believes arereasonable. The Agency cautions, however, that the ability of the modelsto accurately simulate actual field situations accurately has not beenverified. As noted above, questions remain about the adequacy of some aspectsof the model framework and the appropriateness of some of the parametervalues. Thus, the Agency is soliciting comment on all aspects of the modelused to calculate the numerical limits for the disposal of sludge in monofills.<ITAG tagnum="81">Incineration</ITAG>The Agency used a single exposure pathway, inhalation of the incineratoremissions, in analyzing exposure to the MEI. The Agency considers the disposalof incinerator ash to be adequately regulated under 40 CFR Parts 257, 258,and 261 through 68. The disposal of scrubber water is subject to NationalPollutant Discharge Elimination System requirements. Generally scrubberwater is recycled into the Publically Owned Treatment Work influent. Oneremaining pathway, exposure to emitted contaminants that may settle onland to water, will be evaluated in the future, as the Agency acquiresmore data and further develops evaluative models.In developing today's proposal, the Agency evaluated the inhalation ofsludge incinerator emissions of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel,and total hydrocarbons. Total hydrocarbons are used as a surrogate forall organic pollutants and will be discussed in Part IX of the preamble.The Agency performed air quality modeling to determine the emission rates(mass per unit time) that can be allowed without imposing undue risks toan MEI in the vicinity of the incinerator. For total hydrocarbons, theallowable emission rate determined by modeling is the numerical limit.For metals, an allowable sludge concentration is derived from the allowableemission rate.The Agency previously evaluated the inhalation of beryllium and mercuryduring development of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants(NESHAPs), which specify allowable emission rates. For this rule the Agencyis taking the NESHAPs values to be the allowable emission rates of berylliumand mercury for sludge incinerators. The analysis of the inhalation of incinerator emissions employs atmosphericdispersion modeling to relate emission rates to ground level exposure concentrations.As discussed below, the allowable emission rate is determined from (1)the allowable ambient air quality concentration at ground level (the riskspecific concentration), (2) the stack height and other physical characteristicsof the site, and (3) the meteorological conditions of the site. The allowablesludge quality is then determined by the above allowable emission rate,the rate of sludge incineration, and emission control efficiency.The allowable ambient air concentration is set to correspond to a riskspecific dose for carcinogenic metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, andnickel), assuming that the MEI inhales 20 cubic meters of air per day andthat indoor and outdoor air concentrations are essentially equal. Leadis set at 25 percent of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Therationale for this value is discussed later in the preamble.The allowable ambient air concentration for total hydrocarbons is basedon (1) statistical relationships between the concentration of total hydrocarbonsand the concentrations of specific organic pollutants emitted by the foursludge incinerators that were tested and (2) the assumed cancer potencyof the specific organic pollutants, as discussed later in the preamble.Three models are used in today's proposal for incineration: ISCLT, LONGZ,and COMPLEX I (Reference number 44). ISCLT is intended for urban or ruralsituations where the terrain elevations do not exceed the stack height.It takes account of the aerodynamic effect of building downwash, whichis likely to be significant for many sludge incinerators with short stacks.The other two models do not evaluate building downwash, but are more appropriatein situations where terrain elevations exceed the stack height. Such terrainis termed complex terrain. LONGZ is intended for complex urban terrain,while COMPLEX I is intended for complex rural terrain.All three models require data on the incinerator, the surrounding terrain,and the meteorology of the site where the incinerator is located. Incineratordata include stack height, stack exit diameter, gas flow, and gas temperature.Meteorological data include joint frequency distributions of wind direction,wind speed, and atmospheric stability. The location of the MEI is not specifiedbeforehand, but is set at the location predicted by the model to have thehighest long-term average concentration.In assessing the exposure to the MEI, ISCLT was used because of its abilityto simulate building downwash. Since the MEI location for facilities withsignificant downwash tends to be close to the incinerator, inability tosimulate complex terrain accurately was not considered a serious shortcoming.Side-by-side comparisons of the three models indicated that ISCLT predictshigher concentrations than LONGZ or COMPLEX I, even in complex terrain.Evaluation of the effect of model parameters on the results indicated thatstack height was a key parameter. Consequently, the dispersion factor (maximumlong-term exposure concentration per unit rate of emission) varies withstack height. To generate a regression relationship between dispersionfactor and stack height, a number of facilities having various stack heightswere modeled. Although the stack diameter and gas velocity also variedamong these facilities, these parameters were not important and had littleeffect on the regression relationship. Other parameters were held constantand were applied to all facilities: wind characteristics of Atlanta, Georgia(which had the worst combination of parameters in any U.S. city examined);flat terrain; gas temperature (38 degrees Celsius); building height (5.5meters); and building effective diameter (39.5 meters) (Reference number27).The metals emission control efficiencies assumed in assessing the exposureto the MEI correspond to the worst 10 percent of EPA's data on sewage sludgeincinerators. These control efficiencies are as follows: arsenic, 96 percent;cadmium, 65 percent; chromium, 96 percent; lead, 67 percent; and nickel,95 percent. Control efficiencies are not assumed for organic compounds.Instead, total unburned hydrocarbons are to be used to control organicemissions.<T3>Technical Uncertainties And Issues In The Analysis Of Incineration.</T3>The risk analysis for incineration employs a commonly used air modelingapproach, coupled with readily measurable input data. Nevertheless, thereremain a few technical issues, which are described below.<T3>Worst-Case Conditions.</T3> In determining the relationship betweenMEI exposure and stack height, the Agency used the meteorology of Atlanta,Georgia, the worst case of 18 sites evaluated. Emission control efficienciesfor metals correspond to the worst 10 percent of EPA's data on sludge incinerators.Other less important parameters were based on the typical values.The MEI is assumed to remain at the location of maximum concentration for70 years. The emissions are assumed to be 100 percent respirable and absorbedby the MEI. Indoor air quality was assumed to be no better than outdoorair quality.<T3>Deposition Of Particulate Pollutants. </T3>The current analysis assumesthat all emissions remain airborne, thus maximizing their potential forinhalation by the MEI. The SAB, however, recommended that the analysisaccount for human and ecosystem exposure to incinerator emissions depositedon the ground.EPA is developing a methodology to perform such an analysis, and will considerit for future application. The methodology involves predicting depositiononto soil and vegetation, further movement of settled pollutants throughenvironmental media, bioaccumulation, human exposure, and ecological effects.<T3>Short Term Variations. </T3>The methodology used in this proposal predictslong-term exposure for the average operating conditions at an incinerator.The SAB has suggested that the analysis also consider short-term fluctuations.The Agency considers it unlikely that potential short-term effects couldbe of greater concern than the potential chronic or long-term health effectsconsidered here. However, if adequate data become available to supportan analysis of short-term fluctuations, they will be evaluated.The Agency continues to investigate the effect of regularly occurring start-upand shut-down events on the long-term average emission control efficiency.The Agency's initial investigations of this suggest that the effect maynot be particularly important.<ITAG tagnum="84">PART V: HUMAN HEALTH CRITERIA </ITAG>Over the years, the Agency has proposed, and either promulgated or publishedas guidance, criteria to protect public health and the environment fromthe adverse effects of specific pollutants. Where such criteria are available,these criteria are used in the exposure assessment models to derive numericallimits. EPA is seeking public comment on the manner in which the Agencyis proposing to use the criteria in today's proposal. As previously explained, the human health criteria that were used in establishingnumerical limits for monofills are the maximum contaminant levels (MCLs)for drinking water. Where MCLs have not yet been promulgated in final form,proposed MCLs have been used to establish health-based limits for ground-watercontamination. When MCLs are revised, the new drinking water standardswill be adopted for this purpose. In the incineration equation, EPA usedthe National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for mercuryand beryllium, and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for lead.Water Quality Criteria were used in the appropriate pathways of exposurein the land application model. <ITAG tagnum="85">Criteria for Non-carcinogens </ITAG>Where the Agency has not published human health criteria for a non-carcinogenicpollutant, the Agency is proposing to use a reference dose (RfD) listedin the Agency's computerized Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS).Information on access to the data in IRIS is listed in Part XIII of thepreamble. An RfD is a threshold below which adverse human health effects are unlikelyto occur. The RfD is directly analogous to a previously used EPA-term ``acceptabledaily intake'' (ADI). The Agency prefers the term RfD rather than ADI toavoid the implication that doses below the threshold are always acceptable,while doses above the threshold are always unacceptable. The RfDs listed in IRIS are based on an intra-Agency review of the latestscientific information used in the Agency's risk assessments. EPA derivesthe RfD threshold by evaluating toxicity data for humans (where available)or animals. If multiple studies with different animal species are available,the most sensitive species is often selected. From such data a ``no observedadverse effect level'' (NOAEL) is identified for the critical toxicologicaleffect or end point. The NOAEL is the highest dose of a chemical at whichthere is not a statistically or biologically significant increase in frequencyor severity of an adverse effect when individuals in an exposed group arecompared to individuals in a control group. The RfD typically is set 100-1000fold below a NOAEL, depending on the quality of the data available. The Agency recognizes that the actual threshold value at which adversehuman health effects may occur could be an order of magnitude higher orlower than the value listed in IRIS. While exposure above the RfD increasesthe probability of adverse effects, it does not produce a certainty ofadverse effects. Similarly, while exposure at or below the RfD reducesthe probability, it does not guarantee the absence of adverse effects.The procedure used to establish the RfD does not permit the Agency to estimatewhat fraction of the population would exhibit effects for exposure above,at, or below the RfD.RfDs were used to derive an acceptable daily dietary intake (DDI) for theland application and distribution and marketing equations. To derive theacceptable DDI of a pollutant from food and animal products raised on sludge-amendedsoils, the Agency subtracted the background intake from the RfD. The backgroundvalues were average values listed in the literature for toddlers and adultsand include intake from drinking water, food other than food grown or raisedon sludge-amended soils, air, and, in the case of lead, household dust.Because the Agency has not established an RfD for arsenic, the MCL forarsenic was used to derive an acceptable DDI.<ITAG tagnum="85">Derivation of Lead Limitations for Land Application</ITAG>EPA is concerned about the health implications of exposure to lead. Itis the Agency's objective to minimize lead exposure, particularly for susceptiblesubpopulations. When sewage sludge is applied to agricultural land, individualsare exposed to lead from food or food products grown on sludge-amendedsoil. In land application, the human health pathway is not the most stringentone for the control of lead. An ecological pathway is the most stringentone. Nonetheless, due to the paramount concern about the human health impactsof lead, the following discussion describes in detail how the Agency derivedthe lead limits based on human impacts. Not only will this promote publicdiscussion and informed comment, it will also demonstrate how the Agency'smethodology works for a given pollutant. By 1990, EPA estimates that the average daily total intake of lead willbe approximately 30 micrograms (mg) for children and adults in the UnitedStates. Although food is the source of 50 to 75 percent of the overalllead intake for the average adult and of 30 to 45 percent for the averagechild, only 0.02 percent of this food is grown on sludge-amended soil.Therefore, the portion of overall lead intake attributable to food fromsludge amended soil is negligible (30 mg x. .75 x .002 = 0.0045 mg) evenbefore Federal regulation of lead in sewage sludge. For comparison purposes,the proposed drinking water MCL if 5 mg/per liter which allows an individualto intake 10 mg/per day (assuming an average individual drinks 2 litersof water per day). This level is 2,000 times higher then the average exposurefrom lead in sludge applied to agricultural land. EPA believes the concentration of lead in sewage sludge applied to agriculturalland should be limited. Despite its small contribution to daily lead intake,further reduction will promote EPA's policy of lowering blood lead levels.The Aggregate Risk Analysis estimates that at a baseline there are 920women, children, and white men (the Aggregate Risk Analysis explains whyonly white men were tabulated) who would be at risk of adverse effectsas a result of the application of sewage sludge to agricultural land withcurrent concentrations of lead. The overwhelming majority of these aremen with hypertension. The same analysis estimates there could be 38 casesof adverse health effects related to this sludge exposure (see Table VIII-1in Part VIII of the preamble). These demonstrate the potential for reductionsin human health impacts through control of lead levels in sewage sludgeapplied to agricultural land. The adverse health impacts could also increaseif there is an increase in land application of sewage sludge consistentwith EPA's Policy on Beneficial Reuse. Consistent with the statutory directive that the Agency protect against``reasonably anticipated adverse effects'' (see section 405(d)(3) of theCWA), EPA conducted, here as elsewhere, an analysis using a combinationof reasonable worst-case assumptions to calculate the lead limit. Thisinvolved modeling how lead travels from sludge applied to land, throughthe food-chain, to a human endpoint. The additive effect of this combination of reasonable worst-case parametersproduces a lead limitation that is sufficiently protective of the mostexposed individual (MEI) while also accounting for potential data inadequacies.These lead limitations will protect the general population by loweringthe total exposure to lead from food grown on sludge-amended soils. However,the method does not drive the limits to levels necessary for protectionin every conceivable worst possible circumstance. The actual methodology involves a number of steps. Since EPA has not establishedan RfD for lead, it examined the health effects from lead that are generallycorrelated with blood lead levels to select the human endpoint most sensitiveto lead exposure from sewage sludge. Lead exposure across a broad rangeof blood lead levels is associated with a continuum of pathophysiologicaleffects, including interference with heme synthesis necessary for formationof red blood cells, anemia, kidney damage, impaired reproductive function,interference with vitamin D metabolism, impaired cognitive performance,delayed neurological and physical development in newborns and elevationsin blood pressure among adults. There are several options available for this sensitivity parameter. Whitemiddle-aged men (40-59), young children (0-2), and pregnant women (as exposuresurrogates for the fetus) are all subpopulations especially sensitive tothe toxic effects of lead. Relative to pregnant women, delays in earlymental and physical development of fetuses and infants have been associatedwith maternal blood lead levels. Because the biokinetics of lead duringpregnancy have not been well elucidated, the available data are inadequateto quantitatively predict fetal lead exposure under various exposure scenarios.In young children, lead impacts include impairment of mental and physicaldevelopment, including loss of hearing and reduced attention span in school.For white, middle-aged men, several studies have found a small, but consistent,relationship between blood lead levels and blood pressure. The blood pressureincreases may be associated with some increased risk for more serious cardiovasculardisease events, such as strokes and heart attacks, especially if bloodlead levels are chronically elevated (Reference number 45).Although children absorb more lead from food, they are not maximally exposedto lead in sewage sludge. Children do not typically consume food grownon sludge-amended soils to the extent that adults do. Since adult malesconsume more food than women and children, they are more exposed to, andmay be most affected by, changes in lead concentrations in sludge thatis applied to agricultural lands. Therefore, for this parameter, EPA selectedmiddle-aged men as the human endpoint most sensitive to lead effects. Step two in the process is to select a blood lead level of concern. Inrecent rulemakings, the Agency has selected a level of 10 andCx.18;g of leadper deciliter of blood as a level of concern for health effects which warrantavoidance in infants and children. Research on white males 40 to 59 yearsold (Reference number 30) found significant associations between bloodlead levels and blood pressure after accounting for the other known factorspreviously associated with elevated blood pressure. This research showedthat, with little change in the coefficient, the relationship also heldwhen tested against every dietary and serological variable measured inNHANES II data, a data base on health and nutrition in the U.S. population(Reference number 30). There remains considerable uncertainty as to thelocation of a blood lead threshold, if any, for a blood pressure changeand the mechanisms by which these changes occur. Therefore, the Agencyhas not yet determined an appropriate blood lead level to serve as a targetfor the protection of adult men from elevated blood pressure associatedwith exposure to lead. However, for purposes of this analysis only, EPAassessed the potential effects of this proposed regulation on adult menbased on a blood lead level of 10 andCx.18;g/dl. If the Agency determinesthat the level of concern is lower than 10 andCx.18;g/dl, we will re-evaluatethe impacts of this proposal and may choose a different limit on lead insludge which better reflects the appropriate blood lead level of concern.The third step in the process is to choose a baseline lead exposure levelfrom all sources other than food grown on sludge-amended soils. The August1988 Draft Report, ``Review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standardsfor Lead: Exposure Analysis Methodology and Validation'' (Reference number82), included estimates of average lead exposure levels under various airlead concentrations. The report projected a 1990 baseline average bloodlead level for white middle-aged men of 3.9 to 4.9 andCx.18;g/dl. These levelsresult from exposure to all media including air, drinking water, food otherthan food grown or raised on sludge-amended soils, dust, and dirt.It must be noted that these calculations are for an average exposed individualin a large population. Baseline exposure to lead results in blood leadlevels that are lognormally distributed. To more completely characterizerisk, we must examine blood lead distribution around the average baseline.Given a mean baseline lead in middle-aged men of 4.4 andCx.18;g/dl and ageometric standard derivation of 1.37 (from NHANES II), approximately 10percent of the population would be over 6.7 andCx.18;g/dl and 1.0 percentwould be over 9.2 andCx.18;g/dl. Because of the Agency's concern for thoseindividuals who are exposed to above average lead levels at the baseline(individuals most exposed to lead), EPA selected 8.0 andCx.18;g/dl as thebaseline blood lead exposure level. This corresponds approximately to the95th-percentile of the distribution.Step four is to determine the allowable daily intake of lead for sludgethat is still protective of the blood lead level of concern. To derivethe ADI, the Agency subtracted the baseline blood level exposure level(8 andCx.18;g/dl) from the blood lead level of concern (10 andCx.18;g/dl).The Agency then calculated what amount of lead intake from food grown onsludge-amended soils would translate into 2 andCx.18;g/dl.Not all of the lead in food that is eaten is absorbed by the body. A methodto convert dietary lead intake to blood lead level is described in theDraft Exposure Report and is based on experimental studies, in which dietarysupplements were administered to volunteers, and duplicate diet studies.Two studies are identified as most useful in estimated a dietary lead/bloodlead relationship (see Reference numbers 83 and 84). For middle-aged men,the coefficient of increase of blood lead level and lead intake attributableto consumption of lead in food is 0.032. Dividing 0.032 into 2 yields of62.5 andCx.18;g of lead per day allowable intake due to consumption of leadin foods raised on sludge-amended soils. To be conservative, the Agencychose to limit the allowable intake of lead from sludge to 20 andCx.18;gper day rather than 62.5 andCx.18;g.Step five requires the selection of an individual who is most exposed tosludge (MEI). Approximately 0.02 percent of national agricultural landis treated with sludge each year. With an assumption of complete nationalmixing of food, an average individual's diet of fruits, vegetables, andmeat products contains no more than 0.02 percent of foods grown on sludge-amendedlands. To be protective, we assume to MEI receives over 100 times moreof his food supply from sludge-amended soils than the average individual.The model attributes 2.5 percent of the MEI's diet to food from sludgetreated soils due to potentially high consumption from roadside stands.Step six is to establish, for each step in the pathway of exposure throughthe environment, an allowable concentration of lead in the soil and inthe plant. The concentrations are based on reasonable worst-case assumptionsthat speed the transport of lead through the environment and that magnifythe bioaccumulative effects of lead in plants and animals. The approachand values used are detailed in Part IV of the preamble and in the ``TechnicalSupport Document: Land Application and Distribution and Marketing of SewageSludge'' (Reference number 57).Step seven is to establish a lead limitation that would not exceed theallowable DDI. In this case, the model calculated, for the human healthpathway, a cumulative pollutant loading rate for lead of 176 kilogramsper hectare (kg/ha). However, the model calculated a non-human health cumulativepollutant loading rate of 77 kg/ha. Therefore, the human health pathwaywas not the most stringent for this pollutant. Because the environmentalor non-human health limitation is more stringent, the limit for lead willbe even more protective of human health.It is important to note the relationship between the proposed limitationand current requirements. Thirty-two States now limit the application oflead to soil. The rates range from 200 kilograms of lead per hectare to2520 kilograms of lead per hectare. The median value is 530 kilograms oflead per hectare. Current EPA guidance suggests that lead should not beapplied at a cumulative pollutant loading rate in excess of 500-2000 kg/ha.The proposed lead limit of 125 kg/ha will result in very significant reductions,more than 80 percent.The Aggregate Risk Analysis projects the number of people exceeding bloodthresholds would drop from 920 to 249 after regulation for a benefit of671. Likewise, the lead cases due to land application would drop from 38to 10.Because of the reasonable worst-case conservative nature of this methodology,EPA believes the proposed regulation is very protective of human healthimpacts from lead. However, we invite comment on the methodology and ourselection of parameters. The Agency is interested in whether the publicbelieves EPA has been sufficiently protective or whether EPA should havebeen more conservative. For example, comment is sought on the advisabilityof selecting 15 mg per day instead of 20, as the allowable daily intakeof lead from sludge, in Step 4. Conversely, the Agency also seeks to knowif the public feels it has been too conservative (e.g., in Step 4, EPAcould have used the 62.5 andCx.18;g per day of lead produced by our analysisas the allowable daily intake.As described above, this human pathway analysis is based on evaluatingmiddle-aged men as the human endpoint most sensitive to lead exposure fromsludge. The limitation derived from this methodology will not only protectthat MEI but, of course, will also protect the general population and othersensitive subpopulations. Of the 920 people estimated at the baseline tobe at risk of adverse health effects resulting from lead in sewage sludgeapplied to agricultural land, less than 30 are women or children. The proposedregulation will reduce that number to less than 10. Nonetheless, we invitecomment on whether the proposed limitations are sufficiently protectivefor the specific subpopulations of children 0 to 2 and pregnant women.As mentioned earlier, there is the potential for an increase in the applicationof sewage sludge to agricultural land. Such an increase could increaseexposure to lead from sewage sludge. In fact, our impact analysis projectsthere will be a 10-percent decrease in agricultural land.EPA is also interested in comments on the impact of these limitations onthe beneficial reuse of sludge and on the potential inter-media transferof lead risks. Some municipalities have suggested that our analysis understatesthe impact and will preclude land application of sludge in most cases.If this is the result, increased amounts of sludge will be incinerated.This could reduce a greater lead exposure and increased numbers of individualsadversely affected by land. On the other hand, reduction of lead in gasolinemay have resulted in lower amounts of lead in sludge (at treatment plantswith combined sewers). Therefore, tight limits on lead in sludge may notpreclude or reduce land application or increase incineration of sewagesludge. EPA is particularly interested in data on these matters that commenterscould provide.<ITAG tagnum="85">Criteria For Carcinogens</ITAG>As discussed in the ``Final Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment''(51 FR 33992, September 24, 1986), the Agency classifies a pollutant'spotential for exhibiting carcinogenic hazards by considering the weightof evidence indicating that a pollutant is a carcinogen. The classes ofcarcinogens are:andbullet; Group A_human carcinogen based on sufficient epidemiological data;andbullet; Group B1_probable human carcinogen based on sufficient animaldata with suggestive human data;andbullet; Group B2_probable human carcinogen based generally on sufficientanimal data without suggestive human data;andbullet; Group C_possible human carcinogen based on more limited animaldata;andbullet; Group D_not classifiable as a carcinogen due to insufficient data;andandbullet; Group E_evidence of non-carcinogenicity.Twenty-one of the pollutants for which the Agency is proposing standardshave been classified as carcinogens.

A pollutant's potency is a measure of itsability to increase the risk of contracting cancer over a life time, expressedper unit of daily dose. For Group A pollutants, the cancer potency wasbased on epidemiological data. For all others, potency was estimated fromanimal test data. The Agency's upper-bound potency estimates are shownin Table V-1. Estimates of cancer risks resulting from given levels of exposure are subjectto great uncertainty. Extrapolation of carcinogenicity from animals tohumans involves uncertainties due to differences in physiology and metabolism.Extrapolation from high doses generating a detectable cancer response tolow doses corresponding to environmental contamination involves uncertaintiesin the shape assumed for the dose-response curve. For the Table V-1 pollutants, the Agency has extrapolated the responseat high doses to the predicted response at low doses assuming the linearizedmulti-stage model. Compared to other available extrapolation models, theAgency's model generally produces higher estimates of cancer potency andrisk. The proposed numerical limits would be higher, possibly by one ortwo orders of magnitude, if a different extrapolation model had been used.The uncertainties are most pronounced for pollutants showing indicationsof cancer-promoting action but not cancer-initiating action. Such pollutantsinclude DDT. Of the available cancer dose-response models, none is recognized as producingthe most accurate results. EPA does not believe that procedures yet existfor making ``most likely'' or ``best'' estimates of risk. Rather, the Agencybelieves that its procedures produce a plausible upper limit for risk.Such an estimate, however, does not necessarily give a realistic predictionof risk. The true risk may be as low as zero. In determining the appropriate dose to use in the exposure assessment modelsfor carcinogenic pollutants, EPA uses the quotient of an incremental riskand the potency value, Q<T2>1</T2>*. The incremental risk is defined as the probability of an individualcontracting cancer following a lifetime of exposure to the maximum modeledlong-term ambient concentration. Estimates of maximum individual lifetimecancer risk are usually expressed as the probability represented as a negativeexponent of 10. For example, one additional cancer case in an exposed populationof ten thousand is written as 1andmultiply;10^4, in an exposed populationof one in one hundred thousand is written as 1andmultiply;10^5, and in anexposed population of one in one million is written as 1andmultiply;10^6.The incremental risk cannot be construed as an absolute measure of therisk to the exposed population because of the uncertainties described above.Furthermore, a case does not indicate the severity of the outcome. An additionalcancer case does not necessarily mean a terminal illness. Therefore, suchestimates are best viewed as relative estimates of the likelihood of cancer.The Agency usually evaluates risk targets ranging from 1andmultiply;10^6to 1andmultiply;10^4 in making regulatory decisions. Risk levels of 1andmultiply;10^6to 1andmultiply;10^4 are generally considered acceptable depending on (1)the pollutants involved, (2) the weight of evidence that the pollutantsare human carcinogens, (3) the uncertainties in the analyses, (4) the certaintyand severity of the risk posed by the pollutants or activities, (5) thereversibility of the health effects, (6) the number of people exposed tothe pollutant, (7) the advantages of the activity, (8) the risks and advantagesof any alternatives, and (9) the requirements of the statute under whichthe pollutants or activities are to be regulated. Risks of less than 1andmultiply;10^6(i.e., 1andmultiply;10^7) are very small and these lower estimates increasein uncertainty. Because of the uncertainties of the models and analyses,EPA may build in margins of safety through either the parameters it usesin the models or the risk target it selects as a basis for its regulatorydecisions.<ITAG tagnum="85">PART VI: ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA</ITAG>Section 405(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) requires standards that protecthuman health and the environment. To ensure that the numerical limits protectnot only human health, but also the environment, the Agency examined thepathways through which plants and animals would be exposed to a pollutantwhen sewage sludge is applied to agricultural and non-agricultural landor distributed and marketed. The Water Quality Criteria published underauthority of section 304(a)(1) of the CWA were used as the end point fordetermining a pollutant concentration that would generally ensure waterquality adequate to support fresh water organisms. The guidelines thatthe Agency uses to develop criteria for aquatic organisms are publishedin 45 FR 79341, November 30, 1980.Similar criteria have not been developed for the terrestrial target organisms.EPA could not follow the Water Quality Criteria guidelines in developingcriteria for terrestrial organisms because studies have not been conductedon a sufficient variety of species for the Agency to follow the guidelines.Data are generally available for only domestic or commercially valuablespcies, not for wild plants and animals. Therefore, in selecting an environmentalcriterion for terrestrial organisms, the Agency used the threshold pollutantvalues, reported in the scientific literature, that were identified withreductions in growth, reproductive health, lifespan, and other symptomaticmanifestations of toxicity. The species most sensitive to a pollutant wereselected. Where sufficient data were available, the Agency set the allowableexposure at the geometric mean of (1) the lowest observed level of exposurethat causes an adverse effect in a species (LOAEL) and (2) the highestobserved level that did not cause an adverse effect in that species (NOAEL).Where it was not possible to bracket the LOAEL and NOAEL, the maximum safedose for a species was used instead.The Agency identified pollutant concentrations that would not exceed avalue toxic to herbivorous animals exposed to pollutants by ingesting thesludge when grazing or by eating feed crops grown on sludge-amended soils.Toxicity values for cattle or sheep were used as the basis of the numericalvalue for the grazing animal. Toxicity values for swine, cattle, sheep,or chickens, depending on the pollutant, were used for animals eating feedcrops. These values were in turn inserted into the model to develop a numericallimit for the particular pathway of exposure to ensure that grazing andnon-grazing herbivorous animals would be protected.To protect soil biota, the Agency used toxicity thresholds for earthwormsand grubs, although earthworms are generally the most sensitive speciesand the species for which the most data are available. However, data wereevaluated for a broad range of soil biota, including microorganisms andsmall invertebrates living in or on the soil.In selecting a toxic threshold for insectivorous mammals or birds consumingsoil biota as a large portion of their diet, EPA used the predator of thesoil biota having the highest bioconcentration factor for a particularpollutant to develop the lowest dietary concentration causing an adverseeffect on a predator. Generally the most sensitive species were birds,although data for insectivorous mammals, such as moles, were also evaluated.The Agency is making the assumption that by using the highest availablepollutant uptake slope in soil biota and the lowest available dietary thresholdin domestic birds, the numerical limits will protect untested wild speciesas well.In developing the threshold values for phytotoxicity, the Agency attemptedto use the highest quality data available. Over the years, research onsludge used in the production of agricultural commodities demonstrateda hierarchy in data quality to predict field or ``real world'' conditionsof pollutant uptake in plants and phytotoxicity. Generally, experimentsconducted in fields using sewage sludge that already contains the heavymetals for study produce the most relevant data. Next in the hierarchyare experiments in which plants are grown in pots using sludge that alreadycontain the heavy metals for study. A third level of data are derived fromexperiments in which salt solutions of the metals that are being studiedare spiked into sludge which is then used to grow plants in pots. Responsecurves for plant uptake from such studies result in concentrations of traceelements and impacts on plant growth that are much higher and more severethan the use of data from the more representative field study.The Agency selected data from the first category, if available. If datain this category were not available, data from the second category wereselected. Only if data in the first two categories were not available,did the Agency select sludge-salt data. The proposed numerical limits fornickel and zinc are based on the phytotoxicity pathway and are derivedfrom sludge-salt data. The Agency invites comment on the use of sludge-saltdata when sludge field data are not available.In developing threshold values for phytotoxicity, the Agency derived thevalues on the basis of the geometric mean of the LOAEL and the NOAEL inthe species most sensitive to a pollutant. Depending on the pollutant,the most sensitive species were generally leafy green vegetables, rootcrops, or legumes. The studies from which data were taken were generallythose in which the soil pH was 6 or greater because this is the usual conditionthat maximizes crop productivity.The numerical limits included in today's proposal are based on the mostlimiting pathway of exposure. The phytotoxicity pathway was the limitingpathway for chromium, copper, nickel, and zinc for both land application(agriculture) and distribution and marketing. Toxicity to predators (ducks)eating soil biota (worms) was the limiting pathway for lead in both landapplication (agriculture) and distribution and marketing. Toxicity to farmanimals eating harvested feed grown on sludge-amended soils was the limitingpathway for molybdenum and selenium. For all other pollutants in land application(agriculture) and distribution and marketing, the limiting pathways ofexposure were those affecting humans.The ``Technical Support Document for Land Application of Sewage Sludge''(Reference number 57) lists the values selected and the rationale usedin selecting those values. The Agency invites the public to review thevalues listed in the Technical Support Document and to recommend othervalues where appropriate. The Agency is particularly interested in receivingdata and information on toxicity values for wild plants and animals tosupplement the data on which the environmental criteria were established.<ITAG tagnum="85">PART VII: AGGREGATE EFFECTS ASSESSMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Introduction</ITAG>EPA assessed the nationwide incidences of disease that could be identifiedand attributed to the use or disposal of sewage sludge. These aggregateeffects were used in evaluating the overall risk of current practices andthe benefits of four regulatory alternatives discussed in Part VIII ofthe preamble.In assessing the adverse human health effects of exposure to sewage sludge-bornepollutants, the Agency developed estimates of the following: (1) Maximumupper-bound individual carcinogenic risk posed by a practice; (2) incidence(i.e., cases per year) of cancer; and (3) number of people exposed to concentrationsof non-carcinogenic pollutants that exceed the reference dose (RfD) orother Agency established health effects-based threshold levels. The Agencyalso employed an innovative methodology to calculate the potential numberof people exposed to lead and cadmium above the health-based thresholds.Estimated aggregate human health effects are provided for sewage sludgethat is applied to agricultural lands, applied to non-agricultural lands,distributed and marketed, placed in monofills, and incinerated. The Agencyused the same exposure methodologies in estimating the aggregate effectson the population as a whole that it used in assessing exposure the mostexposed individual, plant, or animal (MEI).To estimate the aggregate effects of sewage sludge use or disposal, theAgency applied the exposure assessment models somewhat differently fromthe way they were used to assess exposure to the MEI. In assessing exposureto the MEI, the Agency used a reasonable combination of worst-case exposureassumptions with upper-bound toxicity estimates. In the aggregate assessment,the Agency evaluated a range of parameters and often focused on averageor typical assumptions for the exposure models. However, because the Agencyused upper-bound estimates of carcinogenicity, the resulting aggregatecancer cases are upper-bound estimates.<ITAG tagnum="85">Sewage Sludge Quality</ITAG>To estimate human health impacts from sewage sludge use or disposal practices,data are needed on the distribution of pollutant concentrations in sludgeamong all publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). However, since thereare, at present, no data on sludge quality for individual POTWs, the Agencyrelied on data from EPA's ``40 City Study''. The Agency developed threeseparate sludge quantities (50th-, 90th-, and 98th-percentile concentrations)using a logarithmic regression procedure based on the assumption that thePOTW pollutant means are lognormally distributed across POTWs. This procedureis based on fitting a regression line to the data that expresses the relationshipbetween the logarithms of the plant means and the percentile of distribution.The estimated sludge concentrations were assigned to the actual inventoryof POTWs according to the relative contribution of the industrial componentof the wastewater flow, as reported by the POTW.The uncertainties in sludge quality for organic pollutants affect the predictedhuman health effects. Because the Agency's analysis of the human healtheffects of organic pollutants relied on the ``40 City Study'' data, theanalysis may underestimate the effects. With improved sampling and analysisprotocols, the Agency may observe increased levels of the organic pollutantsfor which numerical limits are proposed, as well as additional organicpollutants in sewage sludge, thereby increasing the estimates of potentialhuman health effects.As previously explained, the Agency is gathering additional data on theconcentration of organic pollutants in sewage sludge as part of the NationalSewage Sludge Survey. When the data from this survey become available,EPA will re-evaluate the aggregate effects of organic pollutants. The Agencywill publish the results of the survey in the <T4>``Federal Register'' </T4>and will invite the public to comment onthe data and analyses.<ITAG tagnum="84">Cancer Cases</ITAG>Aggregate cancer cases are derived assuming a linear non-threshold relationshipbetween dose and risk. Annual cancer incidence attributed to a pollutantof a given carcinogenic potency is directly related to two factors. Theseare the size of the population considered and the average exposure withinthe affected population. The predicted incidence of cancer is an upper-boundprediction of the number of new cancer cases per year in the U.S. populationthat are attributable to sludge use and disposal. The actual incidencemay be substantially less than predicted here and, in fact, may be zero.The incidence estimates are not, and should not be construed as, a predicteddeath rate.<ITAG tagnum="85">Non-Cancer Health Effects</ITAG>Aggregate non-cancer risks are expressed in terms of the number of peoplewho are chronically exposed to a concentration of a pollutant that exceedsa fixed reference value. Exceeding the RfD implies a risk of an adversehealth effect, but does not predict the occurrence of such an effect. Forland application, distribution and marketing, monofilling, and incineration,the Agency compared the predicted time-averaged exposure to an RfD or otherhealth effect-based threshold value.The number of people exposed to a given reference value depends not onlyon the population size and mean exposure, but also on the variability ofchronic exposure within the population (coefficient of variation). Forpollutants other than lead and cadmium, the exposure predicted from sludgeuse or disposal was simply added to a mean or typical background exposureand then compared to the RfD. The variability (i.e., coefficient of variation)of background exposure and human response within the population was notconsidered because it could not be estimated reliably. As previously discussed,exposure to concentrations that exceed an RfD implies increased risk butdoes not imply that an adverse health effect will occur. Because the Agencydoes not have the data to use a dose-response curve in generating RfD thresholdsother than for lead, it cannot predict the incidence of a specific noncancerhealth effect. The Agency expects the incidence of such health effectsto be less than the number of people who exceed an RfD threshold.<ITAG tagnum="85">Cadmium And Lead Predicted Exposures  </ITAG>The Agency used a different approach for predicting adverse health effectsfrom cadmium and lead from that used for other non-cancerous pollutants.For these two pollutants, sufficient data are available to support improvedmethods. Estimating health effects from cadmium or lead involves predictingthe concentration of the pollutants in body tissue of exposed individuals.In turn, this ``body burden'' is affected by levels of environmental exposure.For cadmium, body burden is measured as the concentration (micrograms)of cadmium accumulated in a gram of kidney tissue (andCx.18;g/g). For lead,it is measured as the concentration (micrograms) of lead in a deciliterof blood (andCx.18;g/dl). For both metals, data are available to describebackground levels of tissue concentrations in the U.S. population, to linklevels of environmental exposure to expected increments in these tissueconcentrations, and to link tissue concentrations to possible or expectedhealth consequences. Separate health effects and background blood leaddistribution data (population means and coefficients of variation) areavailable for men, women, and children. Adverse fetal effects from leadhave been detected statistically for women with blood lead as low as 10andCx.18;g/dl. Neurological and developmental effects have been detectedin children with blood lead between 10 and 15 andCx.18;g/dl. For white menof age 40-59, blood level increases (even for levels as low as 7 andCx.18;g/dl)have been found to be associated with increased blood pressure. Therefore,``threshold'' values of 7, 10, and 10 to 15 andCx.18;g/dl were selected torepresent blood lead levels above which adverse effects might be anticipatedfor men, women, and children, respectively.  Similarly, data are available describing cadmium concentrations (populationmeans and coefficients of variation) in kidneys separately for smokersand non-smokers in the U.S. Adverse health effects from cadmium have beenobserved in adults with kidney cadmium levels exceeding 200 andCx.18;g/g.Therefore, a ``threshold'' value of 200 andCx.18;g/g was used in estimatingpotential health effects from cadmium. From these data, the Agency calculated the number of people with cadmiumand lead levels exceeding the threshold values because of background exposuresfrom sources other than sewage sludge. The Agency then predicted the incrementalincrease in the levels of cadmium and lead in the kidney or blood thatcould be attributed to sewage sludge use and disposal practices. The numberof people exceeding the thresholds was again calculated as a function ofthe predicted population mean, assuming the same coefficient of variation.This latter calculation includes both the number of people who originallyhad levels of lead or cadmium exceeding the thresholds and the number ofpeople whose blood or kidney levels would exceed the thresholds as a resultof sludge use or disposal. To determine the number of people who exceeded the thresholds for cadmiumand lead because of sewage sludge use and disposal, the Agency subtractedthe original number of people whose levels actually exceeded the thresholdsfrom the number of people whose blood levels were predicted to exceed thethresholds after sewage sludge use and disposal. The key parameters inthis analysis are background mean tissue concentrations, coefficients ofvariation, incremental increase in body burdens of cadmium and lead causedby sewage sludge use and disposal practices, and the cadmium or lead levelsthat may cause a health effect. The ``threshold'' approaches described above were used to predict the numberof exposed individuals potentially vulnerable to adverse health effectsfrom sludge-related exposure to cadmium or lead. Not all of the individualswith cadmium or lead levels above the selected thresholds, however, wouldbe expected to experience actual health impacts. In assessing health risks from lead, the Agency used additional techniquesto estimate the number of individuals likely to suffer the effects underconsideration. For example, the relationship between mean blood lead levelin the white male population and expected blood pressure increases (diastolicpressure greater than 90 mm Hg) in that same population was determinedusing results from semi-log regressions of diastolic blood pressure versusblood lead and from a logistic regression of high blood pressure versusblood lead. As expected, the number of individuals whose blood pressureactually increases as a result of lead exposure from sludge is smallerthan the number of individuals whose blood lead levels exceed 7 andCx.18;g/dlas a result of sewage sludge use and disposal. Similar methods were usedto estimate other health effects from lead exposure and the results wereused to supplement those from the ``threshold'' approaches.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Risks </ITAG>The aggregate effects analysis does not address exposure from pathogenicorganisms or from pathways that were not examined in the exposure assessmentmodels (e.g., the effects of ingesting plants on which incinerator emissionshave fallen). As discussed earlier in the preamble, the Agency is developingexposure assessment models for pathogens and for indirect pathways of exposurefrom sewage sludge incinerators. When these models are complete, EPA willexpand its aggregate assessment analysis to evaluate the effects of theseother risks. The assessment does not quantify ecological effects or farm economic lossescaused by plant or animal toxicity, even though some numerical limits intoday's proposal are based on plant and animal toxicity values. Methodologiesand data are not yet available to accurately estimate the ecological impactsfrom the use and disposal of sewage sludge.  The remaining portion of this discussion briefly describes the factorsthat are considered and the key assumptions that are made in the aggregateeffects (i.e., incidence) analysis for each end use and disposal method.Generally, only a few pollutants contribute to the total adverse humanhealth effects predicted for each method. These pollutants are identifiedand the incidence of human health effects from current use and disposalmethods are projected.<ITAG tagnum="85">Agricultural Land Application  </ITAG>Available data indicate that approximately 16 percent (i.e., 1.2 milliondry metric tons) of all sludge is applied to agricultural and non-agriculturalland. The Agency estimates that about three-fourths of this is used onagricultural land, with substantially more being used on pastures and feedcrops than on crops intended for human consumption. Based on Agency estimates,there are 2,623 POTWs that apply sewage sludge, or distribute sewage sludgefor application, to the land. Of these, 2,020 apply sewage sludge, or distributesewage sludge for application, to agricultural lands. In estimating the aggregate effects from the consumption of food grownon sludge-amended soil, the Agency evaluated the following pathways:  andbullet; Sludge-Soil-Plant-Human andbullet; Sludge-Soil-Plant-Animal-Human andbullet; Sludge-Soil-Animal (direct ingestion)-Human andbullet; Sludge-Soil-Surface Water-Humanandbullet; Sludge-Soil-Ground Water-Human In projecting the aggregate human health effects from applying sewage sludgeto agricultural lands, risks associated with pathways of exposure involvingair were not examined because the exposure assessment models did not showthat these pathways would be significant sources of exposure. The Agency has no data on how harvested crops and food products from differentareas of the country are mixed into the national market place and distributedthroughout the United States. Consequently, the Agency assumed completenational mixing of food products grown on sludge-amended soil, thus equallyexposing the entire U.S. population. The complete mixing assumption hasno effect on predicted cancer incidence because cancer incidence is determinedby the average dose within the population. The complete mixing assumptiontends to underestimate the number of persons who may exceed non-cancerRfDs because an average dose across the population is much less than anRfD. However, where a few individuals are exposed to a larger than averagedose, this larger dose may be sufficient to cause an increase in the bodyburden to a level that exceeds the RfD, depending on the existing bodyburden of the individual. Assuming that sludge is spread on land or ordinary productivity at a rateof 11 metric tons per year, the Agency estimates that, overall, 0.02 percentassumed for the average U.S. consumer's diet is food grown on sludge-amendedsoils, which is substantially less than the 2.5 percent assumed for theMEI's diet. Another difference between the aggregate analyses and exposure assessmentanalyses is that the Agency assumed a national average diet using the ToleranceAssessment System (TAS) in the aggregate analyses. As discussed earlier,the Agency is considering the use of the TAS diet for the exposure assessmentmodel. For the two exposure pathways involving plant uptake of pollutants fromsoil, the coefficients used to estimate the pollutant concentration invarious types of crops per unit concentration in soil represent a key setof parameters. For the exposure pathways involving animal uptake from plantsand directly from soil, the coefficients used to estimate the pollutantconcentration in various animal products per unit concentration in thefeed or soil are key parameters. In both cases, the Agency used the samevalues in the aggregate assessment that were used in the exposure assessmentmodels. However the coefficients, particularly for metals, may overestimatethe effect because the total metal in the soil was used, rather than thesoluble or bioavailable fraction (i.e., portion of the metal that is absorbedby the plant). One important limitation of the assessment of exposure through food isthat projected effects are estimated only for sewage sludge applied ina single year. Multi-year applications were not evaluated. Thus, the effectswould be underestimated for pollutants that remain in the soil for longperiods of time without decomposing, especially the heavy metals. Aggregate exposure through surface water contamination was estimated byapplying the pollutant runoff modeling approach used in the MEI exposureassessment models. To obtain the aggregate pollutant runoff, the runoffper hectare predicted for typical sludge application was multiplied bythe number of estimated sludge-amended hectares in each State. This aggregaterunoff was assumed to be diluted into the estimated total surface waterflow for each State. Aggregate human exposure was estimated assuming 2liters per day intake by surface water users and 10.6 grams per day intakeof fish from State waters. The degree of averaging used in this approachhas no effect on the predicted cancer incidence, but does tend to reducethe predicted maximum risks and the predicted incidence of exceeding anRfD. Aggregate exposure through ground-water contamination was estimated byapplying the previously discussed CHAINMINTEQ-AT123D approach. The areaaffected by each site was taken to be a 90 degree wide slice radiating3 kilometers outward from the sludge-amended site. The ground-water concentrationwithin this entire area was taken to be the maximum concentration predicted(over time) to occur at the centerline of the plume at a distance of 1.5kilometers from the site. The population within this area was estimatedassuming an average density of 0.13 ground water users per hectare (119million ground water users distributed over the area of the United States).Using the methods described above, the Agency projected that applicationof sludge to agricultural lands could result in maximum individual carcinogenicrisks, summed across the 25 pollutants regulated under this practice, of9x10^5 and in an upper-bound cancer incidence of less than one case peryear (0.17). The Agency projects that 921 people would exceed an RfD, andthat all but one case is due to lead. The number of adverse lead effectcases resulting from this exposure is estimated to be 38. <ITAG tagnum="85">Non-Agricultural Land Application </ITAG>The Agency estimates that 276,000 dry tons of all sludge is applied tothe land in non-agricultural uses. Such land may be set aside for disposal,forest, or devastated land undergoing reclamation. The Agency estimated aggregate effects from human exposure to the pollutantsthrough the following pathways: andbullet; Sludge-Soil-Surface water-Human andbullet; Sludge-Soil-Ground water-Human For both pathways the Agency used the same approach as described for agriculturalland application. By this means, the Agency estimated that applicationof sludge to non-agricultural land could result in maximum individual cancerrisks, summed across the 25 pollutants regulated in this practice, of 2andmultiply;10<T3>^</T3>\8\ and an upper-bound cancer incidence of less than one caseper year (0.1). The Agency projects that 60 people will exceed a RfD becauseof lead. The number of cases resulting in adverse effects from this exposureis expected to be 3.5.<ITAG tagnum="84">Distribution and Marketing</ITAG>The Agency estimates that about nine percent (i.e., 705,000 dry metrictons) of all sludge generated is distributed or marketed by approximately106 facilities. About 25 percent of this is used in residential settings_halfwas assumed to be applied to home vegetable gardens and half to ornamentalshurbs, flowers, and lawns.The Agency estimated aggregate risks from human exposure to the pollutantsthrough the following pathways:andbullet; Sludge-Soil-Plant-Human (home gardening)andbullet; Sludge-Soil-Human (children ingesting sludge-amended soil)For home gardens, the Agency assumed an application rate of 11 metric tonsper hectare. The exposed population was estimated to be 2.7 million individualswho garden and consume their own produce. For this exposed population,the following percentages of diet were assumed to consist of food grownon the sludge-amended soil: 27.0 percent of root and leafy vegetables,non-dried legumes, garden fruits, and corn; 15.0 percent of potatoes; and7.0 percent of dried legumes. The soil-to-plant coefficients used in theaggregate assessment were identical to those used in the exposure assessmentmodels for a home gardener. In evaluating children's sludge ingestion,the Agency assumed that a home gardener would mix the sludge into the soilto a depth of 15 centimeters. Children were assumed to ingest a sludge-soilmixture at a rate of 0.1 grams per day over a 5-year period.Using the above methodology, the Agency projected that exposure throughfood grown in home gardens amended with sewage sludge products could resultin maximum individual carcinogenic risks, summed across the 22 pollutantsregulated in this practice, of 9andmultiply;10<T3>^</T3>\5\ and in virtually no cancer cases (0.02 cases per year). Againlead was the primary pollutant causing 1552 persons to exceed the RfD.Most of this exposure (1,546 out of 1,552) results from food and most directlyaffects white adult males (1,463 of the 1,546), increasing their risk ofelevated blood pressure. The number of cases resulting from 1,552 personsexceeding the RfD for lead is 95.<ITAG tagnum="84">Monofills</ITAG>Data available to the Agency indicate that 49 POTWs dispose of a totalof 101,000 dry metric tons of sludge per year in monofills (approximatelytwo percent of all sludge generated). To predict potential effects fromthese monofills, the Agency used the same fate and transport model forthe aggregate assessment that it used for MEI exposure. The computer modelused for the ground-water pathway was SLUDGEMAN, which consists of an unsaturatedzone model, CHAIN, the geochemical model, MINTEQ, and the saturated zonemodel, AT123D. The model for landfill vapor loss was based on a methodologyadopted by EPA in 1987. It considers the landfill operating period withuncovered wastes, with shallow temperature cover, and with permanent cover.The Agency did not model all 49 facilities because there were insufficientsite-specific data. Rather, the Agency used a number of generic scenariosto account for the 49 facilities. The modeled scenarios included the followingparameters: five POTW sizes (0 to 0.2 million gallons per day (mgd), 0.2to 1.0 mgd, 1.0 to 10 mgd, 10 to 60 mgd, and 60 plus mgd), sludge pollutantconcentrations that corresponded to the 50th-, 90th-, and 98th-percentilesfrom the ``40 City Study'' and nine hydrological and geological variablesestimated (using the guidelines of the National Water Works Association,1985, Reference number 25) to correspond to site-specific characteristics,where possible. Each facility was assigned to one of the modeled scenariosbased on its size, percent industrial flow, and location.The populations affected by each of the 49 facilities were estimated asfollows. For the volatilization pathway, the Graphic Exposure ModellingSystem was used to obtain 1980 Census data and derive populations in 11ring distances up to 10 kilometers from each landfill site. These populationswere then scaled down to reflect only the downwind populations (i.e., thosewith potential for vapor exposure).For the ground-water pathway, the Agency identified the locations of drinkingwater wells within 4 kilometers of each monofill and determined the numberof persons serviced by those wells. For monofills in Utah and New Hampshire,the Federal Reporting Data System was used. For the remaining sites, Stateor regional authorities supplied the data. To account for the unidirectionalflow of ground water, only those populations within the quadrant of directionalground-water flow were assumed to be at risk of exposure.By this means, the Agency projected that exposure to the 18 pollutantsevaluated for sludge disposal in monofills could result in a maximum individualcarcinogenic risk, summed across all pollutants, of 3andmultiply;10^3 andvirtually no cancer cases (0.02 cases per year). The Agency projects thattwo people would exceed the RfD for cadmium and that 390 people would exceedthe RfD for lead as a result of drinking water from wells in close proximityto monofills. The number of adverse lead effect cases from those with bloodlead levels exceeding the RfD is estimated to be 26. The Agency believesthat it may have applied the models in a manner that substantially over-estimatesthe mobility of some pollutants, particularly lead, out of monofills andinto ground water, thereby over-estimating the risks. The Agency intendsto re-evaluate its modeling assumptions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Incineration</ITAG>Approximately 21 percent (i.e., 1.65 million metric tons) of all sludgeis estimated to be incinerated by 169 POTWs that operate 282 incinerators.Each POTW was assigned to one of 10 model incinerators. The model incineratorsrepresent several characteristics of the facility (such as stack heightand sludge feed rate). One facility in each of the 10 groups of incineratorswas modeled to determine its air dispersion characteristics by using thecomputer model, ISCLT, and supplemented, where appropriate, by LONGZ andCOMPLEX I to account for terrain effects in urban and rural settings, respectively(see Reference number 46). This produced predicted dispersion factors in24 concentric rings from 0.1 to 50 kilometers for each of the 10 modeledincinerators. These dispersion factors indicate the exposure concentrationper unit rate of emission. Additionally, there are 25 POTWs, generating 0.4 million dry tons of sewagesludge, that are currently using ocean disposal. Because of recently enactedlegislation banning all ocean disposal of sewage sludge, these POTWs willhave to shift to alternative methods. Incineration appears to be one ofthe likeliest disposal methods to be chosen by these 25 POTWs. It is byno means certain that all these POTWs will choose to incinerate their sludge;however, the ocean ban legislation is so recent that many POTWs do noteven have preliminary plans in place. For analytical purposes, therefore,it has been assumed that all 25 POTWs will incinerate their sludge. Thisscenario is considered as the baseline practice for these POTWs. As such,the risk of incinerating the sludge generated by the 25 POTWs have beenincluded in the baseline risk of incineration. The Agency projects that if the 25 POTWs incinerate their sewage sludge,the POTWs would operate an additional 34 incinerators. The 25 POTWs werealso assigned to model facilities based on the most likely type of facilitythat they would construct. Metal control efficiencies varied significantly across the tested facilities.For an ``average,'' the Agency used the 25th-percentile control efficiencyof the four tested facilities as the expected efficiency. For assessingthe exposure to the MEI, the Agency used the 10th-percentile of all sewagesludge incinerator test data (see Reference number 56). For organic constituents, EPA took a different approach. Rather than startingwith a sludge concentration and emission control efficiency, the analysisfor organics begins with an emission rate. EPA started with an emissionrate for organics because some of the organic compounds in the emissionsare formed during the sludge combustion process. These products of incompletecombustion may account for a majority of the constituents in the emissionsof an incinerator and for the risk from incinerator emissions. The Agency analyzed data from four sewage sludge incinerators (three multiplehearth incinerators and one fluidized bed incinerator) that were recentlytested to derive organic emission rates. The mean organic emission ratefrom the three multiple hearth incinerators was used as the organic emissionrate of all the multiple hearth and electric arc incinerators in the UnitedStates. The actual organic emission rate from the one fluidized bed incineratortested was used as the organic emission rate of all the fluidized bed incineratorsin the United States. For each of the 316 incinerators, the Human Exposure Model was used toestimate the populations residing within the 0.1 to 50 km concentric rings.The population was assumed to be exposed to the maximum concentration ineach ring when the incinerators are operating under normal conditions.Thus, each of the 316 incinerators was assigned an air dispersion factorderived from a similar facility and the population surrounding the facility.From these data, population exposure and risks could be estimated in eachconcentric ring around each facility. Total population exposure and theeffects of exposure at each facility and at all facilities combined werethen determined. In this way, the Agency projected that exposure to seven metals and totalhydrocarbon emissions from sewage sludge incinerators could result in amaximum individual carcinogenic risk, summed across all pollutants, of5andmultiply;10^2 and an upper-bound estimate of 12 cancer cases per year.The Agency projects that incineration of sewage sludge would cause 794people to have blood levels exceeding the RfD for cadmium and 129,835 tohave blood levels exceeding the RfD for lead. The projected number of peopleadversely affected from exposure to levels of lead above the RfD is 5,976.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary</ITAG>Table VII-1 summarizes the results of the aggregate effects assessmentsconducted for sewage sludge that is applied to land, distributed or marketed,monofilled, and incinerated. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>VII-1._<T4>Aggregate Human Health Effects From Current Sewage Sludge Use and Disposal</T4><H1>  </H1><H1>LA-AG </H1><H1>LA-NON-AG </H1><H1>Dandamp;M </H1><H1>Monofills </H1><H1>INC. </H1><H1>Totals</H1>Facilities/sludge:<ITAG tagnum="3">Number of POTWs</ITAG><D>2,020</D><D>603</D><D>106</D><D>49</D><D>194</D><D>\1\ 2,972</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Volume of sludge (100s dry metric tons)</ITAG><D>926</D><D>276</D><D>705</D><D>101</D><D>1,651</D><D>\2\ 4,083</D>Analysis:<ITAG tagnum="3">Pollutants</ITAG><D>25</D><D>25</D><D>22</D><D>18</D><D>8</D><D>31</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Environmental pathways examined</ITAG><D>14</D><D>2</D><D>6</D><D>2</D><D>1</D><D/>Baseline Aggregate Effects:<ITAG tagnum="3">Cancer cases</ITAG><D>0.17</D><D>0.01</D><D>0.02</D><D>0.02</D><D>12</D><D>12.3</D><ITAG tagnum="13">Exceeding threshold:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="5">Lead</ITAG><D>920</D><D>60</D><D>1,552</D><D>390</D><D>129,835</D><D>132,751</D><ITAG tagnum="5">Cadmium</ITAG><D>1</D><D>0</D><D>1</D><D>2</D><D>794</D><D>798</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Lead cases</ITAG><D>38</D><D>3.5</D><D>95</D><D>26</D><D>5,976</D><D>6,138.5</D><ITAG tagnum="3">MEI risk</ITAG><D>9x10</D>^5<D>2x10</D>^8<D>9x10</D>^5<D>9x10</D>^3<D>5x10</D>^2<D/><F>\1\ Does not include the estimated 2400 POTWs that dispose of theirsewage sludge on the surface of the land.</F><F>\2\ Does not include the estimated 200 dry metric tons of sewage sludgethat POTWs dispose of on the surface disposal sites.</F></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">PART VIII: ALTERNATIVE REGULATORY APPROACHES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Introduction </ITAG>This part of the preamble discusses the alternatives that the Agency consideredin developing today's proposal. EPA is soliciting public comments on theseapproaches and welcomes suggestions for other appropriate approaches thatthe Agency should consider in establishing standards for the use and disposalof sewage sludge. Over the years, EPA has developed different regulatory approaches dependingon the legal requirements of a particular statute, surrounding issues,uncertainties, and information bases. Other EPA statutes covering the samepollutants or activities have very different legal requirements from section405(d) of the CWA. The following discussion examines how different statutesmandate the way in which EPA is to establish regulatory requirements. The U.S. Court of Appeals in the <T3>Vinyl Chloride Decision </T3>(<T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA,</T3> 824 F.2d 1146,D.C. Cir., 1987) ruled that under Section 112 of the CAA, the Agency mustuse a two-step process in making regulatory decisions for National EmissionStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs). The court ruled thatthe first step is to define an acceptable risk based only on health factorsand then to define a regulatory limit. In defining a regulatory limit,the Agency may consider cost, technological feasibility, and other relevantfactors in providing an ample margin of safety, as long as the regulatorylimit does not exceed the acceptable level of risk. As indicated in theBenzene Notice (53 FR 28496, July 28, 1988), depending on the policy approachselected by the Agency, EPA would set carcinogenic risk levels for NESHAPsbetween 1andmultiply;10^6 and 1andmultiply;10^4. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the Agency first defines a goalto limit the concentration of the pollutant in drinking water (for carcinogens,the concentration goal is zero). After setting a goal, the Agency setsan enforceable standard (maximum contaminant level_MCL) based on feasibility.Under the SDWA, the enforceable standard may not necessarily achieve thegoal set for the pollutant, but is established at a level that is safefor human health. The carcinogenic risk levels for drinking water MCLsgenerally range from 1andmultiply;10^6 to 1andmultiply;10^4. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and theToxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) explicitly provide for balancing healthand costs in decision making. The risk levels established under FIFRA rangefrom 1andmultiply;10^6 to 1andmultiply;10^4, depending on the type of exposureinvolved. Applicator exposure is generally in the range of 1andmultiply;10^4and dietary exposure is generally in the range of 1andmultiply;10^6. Theregulatory limits under TSCA are driven by a balancing of economic analysesand exposure analyses, with the exposure analyses taking into considerationadverse health effects other than carcinogenicity. Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Subtitle D (non-hazardouswastes), the Agency sets standards to protect human health and the environmentbased on the reasonable probability that municipal solid waste landfills(MSWLFs) will cause adverse effects. The standards are established takinginto consideration the ``practical capability'' of the facilities. TheAgency is proposing that States establish ground-water protection standardremedies for carcinogens in the range of 1andmultiply;10^7 to 1andmultiply;10^4(see 53 FR 33314, August 30, 1988). However, under Subtitle C of RCRA (hazardous wastes), there is no provisionfor the consideration of costs or the practical capability of a facilityto meet the standards. The standards developed by the Agency under RCRASubtitle C are those that are necessary to protect human health and theenvironment. The Agency will soon propose standards that prohibit hazardouswaste incinerator emissions for metals from exceeding a summed carcinogenicrisk level of 1andmultiply;10^5. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act(CERCLA) directs the Agency to set standards for cleanup by taking intoconsideration the relative degree of risk to human health and the environment.Under CERCLA, the Agency has set standards based on carcinogenic risk levelsof 1andmultiply;10^7 to 1andmultiply;10^4, with 1andmultiply;10^6 as the pointof departure for the analysis. As shown, each statute is unique. Therefore, the regulatory approach andlimits developed under one statute may not be appropriate for those developedunder another statute. Before comparing regulatory requirements, the legalrequirements of the authorizing statute must be examined. In developing a regulatory approach, one of the principles guiding EPAwas to propose reasonable standards. Section 405(d)(2)(D) of the CWA requiresthe Agency to establish management practices and numerical limits thatare ``adequate to protect public health and the environment from any reasonablyanticipated adverse effects of each pollutant.'' The Agency examined theeffect of long-term pollutant exposure when sewage sludge is used or disposedof under conditions that could: (1) Increase the toxicity and potency ofa pollutant in the environment; (2) speed the movement of a pollutant intoand through the environment; or (3) intensify the adverse effect the pollutantmay have on human health or the environment.  This approach accounts for potential data inadequacies, but does not protectagainst every conceivable worst-case situation. For example, we assumethat a monofill may be located in sandy soil rather than in heavy claysoil because pollutants move faster through sandy soils than through claysoils. We also assume that 2.5 percent of the diet of the most exposedindividual (MEI) comes from food grown on sludge-amended soil. By comparison,an average individual's diet contains only 0.025 percent of food grownor raised on sludge-amended soil. In applying sewage sludge products tothe home garden, we assume that the homeowner mixes the product into thesoil or that climatic forces, particularly rain, filters the sludge productinto the soil profile. This assumption means that in evaluating the effectof a child inadvertently ingesting dirt when playing in a garden, EPA analyzedthe effect of a child eating a sludge-soil mixture rather than pure sludge.The Agency analyses also assumed that a child, from the ages of one throughfive, inadvertently ingests 0.1 gram per day of a sludge-soil mixture ratherthan the 0.5 to 5.0 grams per day for a child exhibiting PICA behavior.EPA believes that the combination assumptions protects individuals fromevents that are likely to occur and meets the statutory provision to protectpublic health and the environment from ``reasonably anticipated adverseeffects of a pollutant''. In taking such an approach, the Agency recognizesthat some risks may not have been fully evaluated or may remain after regulation.Individuals who do not follow label instructions (e.g., prevent children,particularly those exhibiting PICA behavior, from mouthing sewage sludge),or those who illegally grow or take all of their food stuffs from landwhere the growing or taking of food is prohibited (e.g., forests wheresludge has been applied), may receive higher doses of a pollutant thanthe level used in developing the numerical limits for the proposed rule.However, we expect that few, if any, individuals will receive higher dosesof a pollutant than the doses used to establish the standards. <ITAG tagnum="84">Alternative Approaches for Establishing Numerical Pollutant Limits</ITAG>In developing a regulatory approach for establishing the management practicesand numerical limits (standards) that would safeguard public health andthe environment, the Agency examined the use or disposal methods and theprobability that individuals would be exposed to pollutants from thesemethods. EPA identified the type of the risks involved, (e.g., breathingair with higher levels of pollutants, drinking water with pollutant levelsexceeding the MCLs for drinking water, etc.) and also examined the possibilityof special populations at greater risk (e.g., small children playing ingardens where sewage sludge products had been applied, the effect of leadon adult males). The Agency also examined whether individuals voluntarilyincurred the risks. For example, risks associated with breathing more contaminatedair by individuals living in close proximity to an incinerator are involuntarily-incurredand, therefore, more unacceptable than risks associated with using a properlylabeled sewage sludge product in a garden. Finally, before developing alternativeapproaches, EPA used exposure assessment models to project the effect onan individual receiving a maximum dose throughout an average lifespan of70 years. Aggregate effects analyses were used to project the incidenceof adverse health effects from sewage sludge use or disposal on the populationas a whole (i.e., the resulting number of cancer cases, carcinogenic risk,number of lead cases, and the number of people exposed to concentrationsof non-carcinogenic pollutants above a reference dose_RfD). In considering a regulatory approach, EPA primarily focused on two typesof risks_risks to individuals receiving the maximum dose and risks to thepopulation as a whole. Using the models and methodology discussed in PartsIV and VII of the preamble, EPA projected that the incremental individualcarcinogenic risks from the five disposal practices range from 2andmultiply;10^8for land application to non-agricultural land to 5andmultiply;10^2 for incineration(see Table VIII-1). The analyses show that, based on incremental carcinogenicrisk, the five use or disposal methods employed by 5,367 facilities maycontribute 12.3 cancer cases annually. However, the Agency could not projectthe type and severity of these cases. EPA also projected that out of 132,751people whose blood lead levels exceeds the RfD, 6,138.5 would exhibit adverselead effects, primarily due to elevated blood pressure in adult males.Most of this exposure is attributed to the incineration of sewage sludge.These analyses show that, depending on how sewage sludge is used or wheresewage sludge is disposed of, individual exposure may be high, particularlyin the case of lead. The Agency developed four regulatory approaches for the use and disposalof sewage sludge. Each of the approaches places greater emphasis on reducingan individual's or other organism's exposure to a pollutant. However, theAgency examined both the individual and aggregate effect of each alternativeto balance the uncertainties in the analyses. Because of the data available,greater emphasis was placed on the human health rather than the environmentaleffects. However, where environmental effects could be identified, evenqualitatively, they were considered.There are differences of opinion concerning the emphasis that should beplaced on individual or aggregate risk. Some take the view that individualcancer risk is the most, or the only, important measure. Arguments thatfavor addressing individual risk maintain that no individual should beat high risk and that consideration of the number of people at risk leadsto acceptance of higher individual risk when few people are exposed. Furthermore,the latter approach leads to the inequity of having the acceptable riskto an individual depend on the number of people similarly exposed. Thelimitation of using maximum individual risk alone is that the measure doesnot indicate how many people may be affected. It only relates the carcinogenicrisk to the MEI.Arguments in favor of examining the aggregate risk are that incidence isan appropriate measure of total public health impact. Therefore, incidenceis a good indicator of whether an approach adequately protects public health.For a rule, such as today's proposal, that covers both carcinogenic andnon-carcinogenic pollutants, there is another disadvantage of using onlyan MEI or an aggregate analysis as a single measure of whether an approachadequately protects public health and the environment. As discussed earlier,methodologies and data do not yet exist, except for lead, to correlatediffering levels of exposure to non-carcinogenic pollutants with incidencesof an effect. The only measure is the number of people exposed to a levelabove a Rfd. This may have little meaning for individual risk. While anyexposure to carcinogens is considered a case, the same assumption can notbe made for non-carcinogens.In addition, the Agency typically weighs the aggregate effects estimatesalong with maximum individual or average cancer risk estimates when evaluatinga particular category of like risks (i.e., the number of individuals exposedto a particular pollutant from a particular type of facility). Some observersquestion the relevance of adding risks, in a rule such as today's proposal,when risks from different types of pollutants present different types ofrisks (i.e., inhalation, ingestion, etc.) from different types of sources(i.e., incineration, land application for agricultural purposes, etc.).Table VIII-1 and the following discussion describe the factors consideredin developing the standards for today's proposal. The first two approachesaccept the aggregate effects of current sludge quality. Approach III isdirected solely to protecting the MEI and Approach IV uses a combinationof MEI exposure and aggregate effects of current sludge quality.Although the combination of approaches in Option IV is the Agency's selectionfor purposes of the proposal, it is not the only possible combination.Commenters should review the proposal keeping in mind that there is flexibilityto choose among the different regulatory strategies (the aggregate riskapproach and the MEI risk approach) depending on such factors as evaluationof new information and the reassessment of incremental risk of sewage sludgeuse and disposal methods. For example, an alternative option might be totake an MEI risk approach for incineration and select an aggregate riskapproach for all other use or disposal methods. The Agency specificallyinvites comment on this possible approach in addition to those discussedin more detail.For the purpose of today's proposal, the aggregate risk approach is basedon ``existing sludge quality''_defined as the 98th percentile pollutantconcentration shown in the ``40 City Study.'' The 98th-percentile pollutantconcentrations are calculated from a regression analysis of the valuesof each pollutant in the ``40 City Study.'' The Agency selected the 98th-percentileconcentration to prevent potential deviations from the pollutant concentrationsin the ``40 City Study'' and to prevent increases in any risks associatedwith current methods of sewage sludge use and disposal. This will ensurethat sludge quality does not get worse and therefore assure the continuingvalidity of the risk assumptions underlying the Agency's regulatory controldecisions. There could, of course, be alternative ways to define the ``existingsludge quality'' basis of the aggregate risk approach. One would be touse a different data base, such as the National Sewage Sludge Survey currentlyunderway. A second would be to select a different pollutant concentrationlevel as one determined to be adequately protective (i.e., the 95th, 99th,or 100th-percentile pollutant concentrations). Are there other data basesor percentile concentrations that the Agency should consider?The Agency is soliciting comments on the suitability of using these approachesas the basis of setting standards for the use or disposal of sewage sludge.The benefits and costs of each option are discussed in detail in the RegulatoryImpact Analysis. Note that the numbering of options 3 and 4 in the RegulatoryImpact Analysis is different from those in the discussion below and inTable VIII-1. To avoid confusion the reader should focus on the contentof each option's requirements when comparing this discussion with thatin the Regulatory Impact Analysis.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table VIII-</T4>1._<T4>Approaches Considered for Setting Standards</T4><H1>Number of facilities affected</H1><H1>Volume of sludge affected in dry metric tons</H1><H1>Number of people exposed</H1><H1>Risk</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Land application: 2623 <P>Distribution andamp;

In establishingnumerical limits for sewage sludge that is incinerated, the Agency woulduse the NESHAPs for mercury and beryllium in 40 CFR Part 61, Subparts Cand E, respectively, 25 percent of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards(NAAQS) for lead, and the particulate limitations and monitoring requirementsin 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart O. In addition, the Agency would have also usednumerical limits for cadmium and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and thepathogen reduction process requirements in 40 CFR Part 257 when sewagesludge is applied to the land. Under this approach, if existing regulationsdo not address a particular pollutant, EPA would have used the toxicitycharacteristic pollutant concentrations in 40 CFR Part 261 to determineif a sludge was hazardous. Therefore, standards for sewage sludge withhazardous concentrations of pollutants would not be established in Part503. All approaches considered by the Agency similarly exclude sewage sludgewith hazardous concentrations of pollutants from the Part 503 standards.As discussed later in Part IX of the preamble, for purposes of Section405, EPA is regulating hazardous sludge under the requirements in 40 CFRParts 261 through 268 and sludge with 50 ppm or more PCBs under the requirementsin 40 CFR Part 761. The first approach was rejected immediately by the Agency because it wouldmisuse the toxicity characteristic concentrations. The toxicity characteristicconcentrations were developed to identify chemical concentrations in wastesthat, if placed in improperly managed MSWLFs have the potential of causingan unacceptably high level of ground-water contamination. The regulatorythresholds do not purport to define a concentration that would be safeif used for growing food or feed crops. The toxicity characteristic concentrations,if used in the exposure assessment models, would result in concentrationsexceeding the human health criteria for the disposal practice. Therefore,if existing pollutant concentrations in sewage sludge were to increaseto levels near the toxicity concentrations, the projected risks posed bythe current use or disposal methods (except for incineration) would increase.Limiting emission levels of sewage sludge incinerators to 25 percent ofthe NAAQS for lead would require incinerators to install wet electrostaticprecipitators (ESPs). At present, States are not controlling lead emissionsfrom sewage sludge incinerators. Therefore, the controls for incineratorswould reduce lead exposure cases by 5,155 and other carcinogenic casesdue to metals by 2.8.Approach II: Use The 98th Percentile Pollutant Concentration (AggregateApproach)The second approach considered by the Agency was to use existing regulations,as in the first approach. However, if existing regulations do not establishnumerical limits, numerical limits corresponding to the 98th-percentilepollutant concentration in the ``40 City Study'' would be established.The 98th-percentile pollutant concentrations would be calculated from aregression analysis of the values of each pollutant in the ``40 City Study''and would be used as a cap on allowable pollutant concentrations. Thiswould preclude potential deviations from the pollutant concentrations shownin the ``40 City Study'' and prevent increases in any risks associatedwith current methods of use and disposal. In addition to management practicesspecified in existing regulations, such as pathogen reduction processesfor the land application of sewage sludge in 40 CFR Part 257, the Agencywould require that labels or information sheets accompany sewage sludgeproducts that are distributed and marketed. These would inform users aboutthe proper use of the product.One advantage of such an approach would be few, if any, disruptions inthe use or disposal of sewage sludge. For example, the Agency projectsthat only three percent of the sludge applied to agricultural lands wouldbe disposed of in MSWLFs. Further significant lead reductions are not projectedbecause the requirement limiting incinerator emissions to 25 percent ofthe NAAQS for lead is included in the first approach and carried forwardin all approaches. A few more incinerators that fire sewage sludge withpollutant concentrations at the 98th-percentile concentration would haveto be fitted with wet ESPs to come into compliance with the numerical limits.The Agency projects a total reduction of 2.9 cancer cases and 5,160 leadcases.However, this approach does nothing to control the rate at which sewagesludge could be applied to agricultural crops. High rates of sewage sludgeapplied to land use for growing food-chain crops could result in residuesthat exceed the Food and Drug Administration's Action Levels and subjectsuch crops to seizure. Furthermore, some of the pollutants at the 98th-percentilepollutant concentrations shown in the ``40 City Study'', if disposed ofin monofills, would exceed the pollutant's MCL for drinking water. In addition,this approach does not significantly reduce the projected carcinogenicrisk to an individual from sewage sludge disposed of in monofills (3andmultiply;10^3)or from incineration (5andmultiply;10^2).Approach III: Use the Exposure Assessment Models for all Practices (MEIApproach)The third approach that the Agency considered was to use the exposure assessmentmodels in establishing numerical limits for all use or disposal methods.The exposure assessment models allow the Agency to limit not only the concentrationof a pollutant in sewage sludge, but also the annual and cumulative loadingrates for pollutants when sewage sludge is applied to land used for growingfood-chain crops or distributed and marketed. This approach reduces themaximum individual exposure to carcinogens by one order of magnitude ormore if the carcinogenic risk levels are within the range usually set bythe Agency (i.e., 1andmultiply;10^6 to 1andmultiply;10^4). There would notbe significant decreases in cancer or lead cases because the Agency projectsthat more treatment works will incinerate their sewage sludge if they canno longer use their current use or disposal method. Incineration posesgreater risks because (1) some of the products of incomplete combustionin the emissions are very carcinogenic; (2) metals are carcinogenic throughinhalation, but not through ingestion; and (3) more individuals are exposedto higher levels of lead.There would be more reductions in the number of cancer and lead cases ifthe Agency had assumed that the sewage sludge failing the numerical limitswould be disposed of in MSWLFs in compliance with the proposed requirementsin 40 CFR Part 258 (see 53 FR 33313, August 30, 1988) rather than incinerated.The Agency did not assume that all of the sewage sludge failing to meetthe numerical limits would be disposed of in MSWLFs because, in some areasof the country, there is insufficient landfill capacity.The disadvantage of using the exposure assessment models for all use ordisposal methods is that such an approach significantly disrupts the wayin which sewage sludge is used or disposed of; 2,829 of the 5,300 POTWswould fail to meet the numerical limits. The Agency projects that all ofthe sewage sludge applied to agricultural land would have to be incinerated,placed in NSWLFs, or composted. Similarly, all sewage sludge distributedand marketed or placed in monofills would need to be incineration.   Another disadvantage of this approach is that some methods would be over-regulatedby protecting individuals from highly improbable risks. For example, itis unlikely that an individual would ever obtain all of his or her foodfrom forests to which sewage sludge had been applied.   Approach IV: Use the Exposure Assessment Models and the 98th-PercentilePollutant Concentration (Combined Aggregate and MEI Approach)  The final approach that the Agency considered, and the one on which theAgency is basing today's proposal, uses a combination of aggregate andMEI analyses (i.e., the second and third approaches). The Agency is proposingto use existing regulations, the NESHAPs for mercury and beryllium and25 percent of the NAAQS for lead when sewage sludge is incinerated. EPAis also proposing to use the exposure assessment models to establish numericallimits, as in the third approach, when individuals are likely to be exposedto high levels of pollutants in sewage sludge or when there are significantscientific uncertainties about the effect of a particular sewage sludgedisposal practice. As discussed in the next section of this part of thepreamble, standards would be based on a higher carcinogenic risk (i.e.,1andmultiply;10^4 and 1andmultiply;10^5) and 1andmultiply;10^6.   When individuals are unlikely to be exposed to the pollutants in sewagesludge, the Agency is proposing to set numerical limits that correspondto the 98th-percentile pollutant concentration in the ``40 City Study''.As in the second approach, the 98th-percentile concentration is a cap onthe allowable concentration of a pollutant in sewage sludge that precludessignificant deviations from the concentrations shown in the ``40 City Study''to avoid increased risk from the disposal of sewage sludge.   The 98th-percentile pollutant concentration would apply to the applicationof sewage sludge to land uses for non-agricultural purposes (i.e., forests,reclaiming lands, etc.), a practice on which human dietary impacts arenegligible. The 98th-percentile pollutant concentration would also applyto the disposal of sewage sludge on surface disposal sites, which are generallysmall, are located away from population centers, and are usually locatedon property owned by the treatment work. The Agency believes that therewould be little, if any, likelihood of exposure to the pollutants fromthese two use and disposal methods.   The advantage of using the exposure assessment models along with the 98th-percentilepollutant concentrations is that the approach targets those methods ofuse or disposal that pose the most risk for reduction in risks. This significantlyreduces the cancer and lead adverse health effects resulting from the disposalof sewage sludge. By implementing this approach, the Agency projects areduction of 9.5 cancer cases and 5,266 lead cases.   As shown in Tables VIII-1 and more fully discussed in the Regulatory ImpactAnalysis, the proposed regulatory approach results in the greatest reductionin cancer and lead cases. There are more benefits in Option 4 than in Option3 even though the carcinogenic risks are established at a less protectivelevel in Option 4 (i.e., 1andmultiply;10^4 and 1andmultiply;10^5) than in Option3 (i.e., 1andmultiply;10^5 and 1andmultiply;10^6) because, under Option 3,more POTWs that cannot meet the numerical limits with their current useor disposal methods switch to incineration. In Option 3, all 2,623 POTWsthat land apply sewage sludge fail the criteria and 260 of these POTWsare expected to shift to incineration as a compliance strategy. Distributionand marketing shifts reduce the net benefits in Option 3 as compared toOption 4. Under Option 3, 35 POTWs that distribute and market sewage sludgeare expected to incinerate their sludge, while under Option 4 only 10 POTWsare expected to do so. Although the controls placed on incineration greatlyreduced the adverse health effects of incinerating sewage sludge, fewerbenefits are realized because of the assumption that more sewage sludgewill be incinerated.   As indicated above, our aggregate effects assessment identified greaterrisks from incineration even though the incinerators meet the numericallimits. The increase in the number of adverse health effect cases fromincineration is due to several factors. First, the aggregate effects analysisin incineration accounted for a greater number of carcinogens that maybe in the form of products of incomplete combustion in the emissions ofan incinerator. Second, the metal pollutants (i.e., arsenic, cadmium, chromiumand nickel) are carcinogenic through inhalation but are not carcinogenicthrough ingestion. Finally, more people have greater levels of exposureto lead near incinerators, thereby increasing the number of people whowould exceed the threshold values.   The Agency anticipates that 509 out of 5,300 facilities will have to findalternative use or disposal methods. About 22 percent of sewage sludgeapplied to agricultural lands would have to be applied to non-agriculturallands or placed in MSWLFs. Similarly, the Agency estimated that approximately30 percent of the sewage sludge distributed and marketed would be incineratedor placed in MSWLFs. All of the sewage sludge placed in monofills wouldhave to be incinerated or placed in MSWLFs. Another disadvantage of the proposed approach is that it focuses almostexclusively on human health effects, leaving the potential for toxicityvalues of non-agricultural plants and animals to be exceeded. Our analysesshow that if 50 metric tons of sewage sludge (on a dry weight basis) wereapplied to a hectare of non-agricultural land and if the sewage sludgeincluded concentrations of copper, zinc, and lead at their 98th-percentilevalue, the pollutant loadings of copper and zinc would exceed the assumedphytotoxicity value for plants (lettuce).However, the Agency does not believe that the 98th-percentile pollutantconcentrations will cause significant or widespread adverse environmentalimpacts in actual practice. Metal concentrations are likely to be lessthan those in the ``40 City Study'' because those data were collected priorto the implementation of pretreatment programs.In addition, field studies in Michigan, Washington, Pennsylvania, Ohio,Illinois, West Virginia, Virginia, and Alabama strongly suggest that theapplication of sewage sludge to non-agricultural land will not cause significantor widespread adverse environment effects. These field studies indicatedthat when sewage sludge is used to stimulate tree growth in forests orto establish a vegetative cover on lands ravaged by strip mining or constructionactivities, most of the pollutants are bound or immobilized in the soileven when high rates of sludge (30 to 300 metric ton per hectare) are applied.Even in acidic forest soils, research at the University of Washington hasfound no problems with metals following sludge application (see Referencenumber 37). Studies have found that the pollutants do not leach below thesoil profile into the ground water (see Reference numbers 9 and 33) orsubstantially elevate pollutant levels in plants or animals (see Referencenumber 2). The increased forage for wildlife in forests seems to outweighany increase in the animals' trace metal body burden.In addition, by establishing vegetative cover on drastically disturbedlands, the vegetative cover significantly reduces the heavy metals in runofffrom previous mining activities (see Reference numbers 33 and 31). Thevegetative cover also holds the soil on these marginal lands, thereby reducinghigh erosion rates and surface water quality impacts (see Reference number33).Concerns have been raised about the conversion of lands receiving sludgewith the 98th-percentile pollutant concentrations to more sensitive useswith greater potential for human food-chain impacts, such as agriculturaloperations or residential uses. Before much experimental data were available,researchers hypothesized that, over time, after sludge was no longer applied,soil bacteria would break down the organic matrix of the organically-boundsludge and free metal ions. Then, supposedly, the free metal ions wouldbecome available and plants would absorb high levels of these metal ions(see Reference numbers 7, 17, and 6).This hypothesis, however, has not been demonstrated in field studies doneon crops grown on sludge-amended soils. Long-term observations show thatthe availability of metallic pollutants for absorption by the plant remainedthe same or decreased over time after sludge applications had ceased (seeReference numbers 34 and 66).A sludge field study in Illinois, where annual applications were made forthree consecutive years at agronomic rates, showed that when sludge applicationhad stopped, the metal concentrations in a variety of crop tissues decreasedrapidly with each successive crop (see Reference numbers 64, 70, 20, and8). Based on these results, there is no reason to believe that metals derivedfrom sewage sludge will become more available to a plant after applicationhas ended.Further, the Agency does not believe organic pollutants will pose significantproblems. Most of the non-persistent trace organics readily volatilizeand degrade in the presence of sunlight and soil microorganisms. The fateof non-persistent organic chemicals, applied to soil has been extensivelystudied, but usually as pure compounds and not in a sludge matrix. Traceamounts of these chemicals are strongly bound to soils, especially if organicmatter is also present. Therefore, these organic chemicals are unlikelyto leach to ground or surface waters or be taken up by plants (see Referencenumbers 15, 6, and 1).Samples of sludge-amended and control site soils have also been analyzedfor persistent organic compounds. These studies indicate that sludge applicationdid not significantly increase the levels of persistent organic pollutantsover the background or control site levels (see Reference numbers 32 and4).Based on the aggregate effects analyses, the Agency believes the 98th-percentilepollutant concentration adequately protects public health and the environment,if the sewage sludge is used or disposed of in accordance with the requirementsin the proposal. However, the Agency is soliciting comment on the approach.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternative Carcinogenic Risk Levels Considered</ITAG>The Agency did not examine alternative RfDs for non-cancerous pollutants.For non-cancerous pollutants, the Agency establishes a threshold value(such as a blood lead level) above which some adverse health effects mayoccur. Available statistical information for most non-cancerous pollutantsis not sufficient to determine the chance that one threshold value or anotherwill produce a specific adverse human health effect. Alternative thresholdvalues, RfDs, are examined when the Agency sets the threshold values. Forthis rule, EPA used the RfD listed in the Agency's Integrated Risk InformationSystem (IRIS). Part XIII of the preamble describes how to access IRIS andobtain the studies used to establish an RfD for a pollutant.However, the Agency did examine alternative carcinogenic risk levels inestablishing numerical limits for the use or disposal of sewage sludge.Since any exposure to a carcinogenic pollutant poses some risk of developingcancer, numerical limits are established on the basis of an acceptablerisk such as one chance in 10,000 (1andmultiply;10^4) of developing cancer.Rather than set a uniform carcinogenic risk target for the use and disposalmethods covered by today's proposal, the Agency evaluated each method individually.This approach allowed the Agency to consider and isolate the risks posedby a particular method.EPA has selected an incremental carcinogenic risk target of 1andmultiply;10^4for sewage sludge used in the production of agricultural crops, the distributionand marketing of sewage sludge products, and the disposal of sewage sludgein monofills. This target was selected because the analyses do not indicatesignificant carcinogenic risk (i.e., 0.22 cancer cases per year from thesemethods combined).The Agency's analyses indicated that incineration poses more carcinogenicrisk than do other use or disposal methods. Incineration may expose 51million people to varying levels of carcinogenic risk resulting in 12 cancercases. To reduce this carcinogenic risk and to compensate for examiningonly one pathway of potential exposure (i.e., the inhalation pathway_seediscussion in Part IV on the indirect pathways of exposure), the Agencyis proposing to regulate the incineration of sewage sludge such that thecarcinogens in the emissions do not exceed an incremental unit risk of1andmultiply;10^5. The unit risk estimate of 1andmultiply;10^5 is comparableto the Agency's hazardous waste incinerator programs.If incineration were regulated at a unit risk of 1andmultiply;10^4 therewould be 165 more lead cases and 6.6 more cancer cases. The Agency estimatesthat compliance costs would be reduced by approximately $62 million. TheAgency specifically invites comments on the merits of selecting a 1andmultiply;10^4incremental carcinogenic risk target for incineration.The Agency considered an incremental carcinogenic risk level of 1andmultiply;10^6.The option was rejected because, as explained above, our analyses indicatethat such an approach would lead to the incineration of greater volumesof sewage sludge with a reduction in the health benefits. Furthermore,there is considerable uncertainty in projecting the number of cancer cases.When that number is already small (for other than incineration), thereis increased uncertainty in projecting further reductions.Carcinogenic risk targets are applied pollutant-by-pollutant in all useor disposal practices, except for the organic pollutants in the emissionsof sewage sludge incinerators. As discussed in Part IX of the preamble,the Agency is setting a limit on the total hydrocarbon emissions from asewage sludge incinerator rather than on each individual organic pollutant.Therefore, the Agency developed the weighted average risk specific concentrationfor the carcinogenic organic compounds listed in IRIS. This is comparableto setting a pollutant-by-pollutant risk specific concentration for themetals in incinerator emissions.In setting carcinogenic risk targets pollutant-by-pollutant, rather thanrequiring the mixture of pollutants in sewage sludge to meet a specificrisk target, there is potential for the summed risks of all the regulatedpollutants to exceed the proposed risk targets of 1andmultiply;10^4 and 1andmultiply;10^5.In examining the potential for the summed risk to significantly exceedthe proposed risk levels, the Agency found it to be highly unlikely.The Agency analyzed a total of 30 facilities using the ``Descriptive Statisticson Contaminants in Municipal Sludge Based on the EPA 40-POTW Study'' (Referencenumber 69) to determine the ratio of the total cancer risk of the pollutantmixture to the cancer risk from the worst or highest risk pollutant foreach use or disposal practice. In most of the 30 sludge disposal situationsconsidered, one pollutant dominated the risk. Only in three of the 30 situationsdid the worst pollutant account for less than half of the total risk. Onthe average, the risk from the mixture was 1.4 fold greater than the riskof the worst pollutant. This ratio varies case by case as shown in TableVIII-2. It has a range of 1.0-3.2, and a median value of 1.1. Thus, ifthe worst pollutant is regulated to a risk of 1andmultiply;10^4, the expectedvalue of the risk of the mixture would be 1.4 andmultiply; 10^4.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>VIII-2._<T4>Randomly Selected Plants_Ratio of Total Risk From Mixture to Risk FromWorst Pollutant</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Plant No.</H1><H1>Ratio</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Incineration (14 pollutants)<D>23</D><D>1.04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>25</D><D>1.38</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>04</D><D>1.29</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>18</D><D>1.24</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>30</D><D>1.26</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>35</D><D>1.17</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>17</D><D>1.60</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>28</D><D>1.08</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>22</D><D>1.80</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>40</D><D>1.78</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Land Application (12 pollutants)<D>13</D><D>1.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>01</D><D>1.36</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>05</D><D>3.23</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>06</D><D>2.28</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>07</D><D>1.83</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>38</D><D>1.00</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>27</D><D>1.02</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>28</D><D>1.00</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>29</D><D>1.00</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Dandamp;M (8 pollutants)<D>08</D><D>1.01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>36</D><D>1.00</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>15</D><D>1.01</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>29</D><D>1.19</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>39</D><D>1.00</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Monofill (10 pollutants)<D>13</D><D>1.04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>25</D><D>1.49</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>32</D><D>2.32</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>27</D><D>1.03</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>22</D><D>1.05</D><R>sandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="1">Mean<D/><D>1.35</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Median<D/><D>1.13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Range<D/><D>1.00-3.23</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of cases<D/><D>30</D></ITAG></ITAG>These results were affected by the assumptions used when a pollutant wasnot detected. For some publicly owned treatment works (POTWs), availabledata allowed the Agency to use the detection limit when the pollutant wasnot detected. For other POTWs, the data only allowed the Agency to usezero when undetected. High values for the risk ratio tend to occur whenthe detection limit is used. For example, the high ratio of 3.23 (in landapplication) occurred for a facility where only one of the 12 pollutantswas actually detected and the detection limits for the pollutants wereused. The low value of 1.00 occurred where only one pollutant was detected.Therefore, EPA believes that the summed risk of all pollutants would notmake a significant difference (i.e., raise the risk of a use or disposalpractice from 1andmultiply;10^4 to 1andmultiply;10^3). The Agency believesthat setting numerical limits to meet a carcinogenic risk target on a pollutant-by-pollutantbasis meets its statutory directive to establish limits for those pollutantsthat may interfere with the safe use or disposal of sewage sludge. Ensuringthat pollutants do not exceed a summed risk would be very difficult. Numericallimits within a permit would have to be constantly re-adjusted to accountfor different pollutant concentrations in the sewage sludge. Such an approachwould be inconsistent with the Agency's principle of developing a rulethat can be implemented. However, the Agency is soliciting comment on itsbelieve that setting numerical limits for carcinogenic pollutants on apollutant-by-pollutant basis adequately protects public health.Concerns have been raised, however, that treatment works would allow individualpollutant concentrations to increase to a point where each pollutant wouldnot exceed the carcinogenic risk level, thereby increasing the overallrisk of a use or disposal method. The Agency believes this is highly unlikelybecause industrial dischargers must meet categorical pretreatment standardspromulgated under other sections of the CWA. In addition to the categoricalpretreatment standards for industrial dischargers, local pretreatment programsmay further limit the discharge of pollutants into POTWs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternatives to National Numerical Limits</ITAG>As discussed in Part IV of the preamble, the exposure assessment modelsare designed to predict the long-term human health and environmental effectsof using or disposing of sewage sludge by the methods covered in this proposal.Sensitivity analyses were performed on the models to identify conditionsthat could reasonably be anticipated. In conducting the sensitivity analyses,the Agency found that varying certain parameters made a significant differencein a numerical limit for a pollutant, without a pollutant exceeding thehuman health or environmental criterion. Factors such as type of soil andthe depth of the soil between the surface and the ground water attenuatethe migration of a pollutant into and through the environment. Detailson the sensitivity analyses may be found in the Technical Support Documentsfor each of the use or disposal methods (Reference number 56, 57, and 58).The Agency considered, but rejected, regulating the use or disposal ofsewage sludge on the basis of only a single numerical limit for all useand disposal methods. A single pollutant concentration protective nationwidecould over-regulate a use or disposal method because different methodspose substantially different risks. Such an approach also fails to recognizethat certain environmental settings are better suited to assimilate orameliorate the effect of pollutants than others.The Agency also considered developing a ``tiered'' regulatory approachfor treatment works that could not meet the national numerical limits orthat did not want to conduct site-specific modeling for all the parametersin the model. Such an approach would establish intermediate numerical limitsbased on varying a few model parameters at each tier. Treatment works wouldsubmit data for different parameters in the appropriate tier to the permittingauthority and the permitting authority would verify that the treatmentwork's sewage sludge met the appropriate numerical limits.One reason for rejecting the ``tiered'' regulatory approach was its complexity.Such an approach would be inconsistent with the Agency's principle of developinga rule that could be implemented easily. It would be impossible to includein the rule all possible variations occurring at a site. Another reasonfor rejecting the approach was that the Agency did not believe that treatmentworks would use the intermediate tiers. Rather than varying only a singleparameter, the Agency felt it more likely that a treatment work would collectdata on as many parameters as possible to determine if, by doing so, theirsludge could meet the numerical limits of a disposal practice.The approach that the Agency is proposing utilizes a combination of nationalnumerical limits and case-by-case site-specific modeling. Depending onthe disposal method, the Agency is establishing national numerical limitsor providing an equation to calculate numerical limits. If a treatmentwork is unable to meet the national numerical limits, the permitting authoritywould calculate new numerical limits based on the physical conditions ata site that make a significant difference in a numerical limit. The parametersfor which a treatment work may submit site-specific data are listed inthe appropriate sections of the rule.In some cases a treatment work may not need to collect data for all theparameters that may be varied in the model. The rule lists the values usedin the models for the parameters that may be varied. Treatment works havethe option of using the values that were used in the models or collecting,at their expense, site-specific data. The data would be submitted to thepermitting authority to calculate a new numerical limit using the exposureassessment models developed for this proposal or other EPA-approved models.Information on the availability of the IBM PC compatible models used inestablishing the numerical limits for this proposal is found in Part XIIIof the preamble.Recalculation of numerical limits based on site-specific data would beavailable to treatment works that dispose of their sludge in monofillsor in incinerators. Site-specific adjustments in numerical limits wouldnot be available for the land application or distribution and marketingof sewage sludge. Based on the sensitivity analyses, the Agency did notfind any physical parameters in the land application model that made asignificant difference in the pollutant limits. Site-specific modelingwould not be available for the distribution and marketing of sewage sludgebecause it is impractical to collect data on all sites where the generalpublic may apply sewage sludge.The Agency is soliciting comment on the approaches that it considered indeveloping the framework for today's proposal. The specific requirementsincluded in today's proposal, as well as alternatives considered in developingthe requirements, are discussed in Part IX of the preamble.<ITAG tagnum="84">PART IX: DESCRIPTION OF 40 CFR PART 503</ITAG>This part describes the standards EPA is proposing for the use or disposalof sewage sludge. The standards include pollutant limits, management practices,and other requirements that define a level of control that owners or operatorsof treatment works and users or disposers of sewage sludge must attainover the use or disposal of sewage sludge to adequately protect human healthand the environment. The pollutant limits, management practices, and otherrequirements are specific to the method of use or disposal employed bytreatment works use. This part follows the organization of the proposedrule to facilitate review and understanding of today's proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Provisions (Subpart A)</ITAG>Purpose and Applicability (andSection; 503.1)EPA is proposing minimum requirements that owners or operators of treatmentworks and users or disposers of sewage sludge must meet when the sludgeis ultimately used or disposed of. The use or disposal methods includedin today's proposal are: (1) Application to agricultural or non-agriculturalland, (2) distribution and marketing, (3) disposal in monofills, (4) disposalon surface disposal sites, and (5) incineration. The Agency has determinedthat the requirements in today's proposal adequately protect health andthe environment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effects of eachregulated pollutant.<ITAG tagnum="81">Local Community's Choice of a Use or Disposal Method</ITAG>Although the Agency prefers local communities to reuse their sewage sludgefor its nutrient and soil conditioning properties, section 405(e) of theCWA reserves the choice of a use or a disposal method to local communities.The pollutant limits EPA developed reflect the risk of each use or disposalmethod. In some cases, protection of public health and the environmentrequire very stringent standards which would be very difficult for a localcommunity to meet. For example, under the proposal, communities are unlikelyto meet the limits that would allow them to dispose of sewage sludge ina monofill over a Class I ground water (i.e., an irreplaceable source ofdrinking water).Section 503.1(b)(4) of the rule reiterates the statutory directive thatthe choice of any sewage sludge use or disposal method is a local one,as long as the treatment work, user, or disposer complies with the requirementsin today's proposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">Ocean Dumping Ban Act</ITAG>EPA planned as part of its comprehensive sludge technical regulation toestablish standards for the ocean disposal of sewage sludge which wouldadequately protect human health and the environment against any adverseeffects of such dumping. The Marine Protection, Research, and SanctuariesAct (MPRSA) establishes a comprehensive permit program for ocean-dumpingactivities. To implement its permitting requirement, Congress directedEPA to establish and apply criteria for reviewing and evaluating permitapplications. These criteria include not only consideration of the effectsof the proposed dumping on human health and the environment, but also onthe need for the proposed dumping and the consideration of land-based alternativesto ocean disposal. Thus, the MPRSA requires EPA to weigh and balance anumber of factors in determining whether or not to permit dumping.The Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-688, November 18, 1988 prohibitsany person from dumping sewage sludge into ocean waters after December31, 1991. In addition, Congress limited ocean dumping during the interimperiod to those communities that were authorized to dump either under anMPRSA permit or court order as of September 1, 1988. Congress also prohibiteddumping after August 15, 1989 unless an MPRSA permit has been obtainedby that time. EPA is moving forward to issue permits for the limited universeof publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) eligible to continue dumping.In addition, the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 also bans the ocean incinerationof sewage sludge. EPA has consistently interpreted the MPRSA as requiringa permit for incineration at sea because it is a form of dumping. Therefore,because no permits for incineration of sewage sludge have been issued andincineration is not permitted under any outstanding court orders, the termsof the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 prohibit ocean incineration afterthe date of enactment, November 18, 1988.EPA had contemplated that its Section 405 standards for ocean dumping wouldbe an important element in the evaluation of environmental effects requiredby the MPRSA. In view, however, of the clearly expressed intention of Congressto eliminate the ocean dumping of sewage sludge by the beginning of 1992,EPA decided not to proceed further with development of ocean dumping standards.It is clear that any standards could not be promulgated until well afterthe date when the MPRSA permits must be in place and, thus, could not servethe stated purpose of providing environmental criteria for the assessmentof ocean dumping applications.<ITAG tagnum="81">Sludge Processing</ITAG>The rule does not apply to the processing of sewage sludge before its ultimateuse or disposal. Before ultimately using or disposing of sewage sludge,treatment works may use one, or a combination, of biological, chemical,physical, and thermal processes to increase the solids content of the sludge(i.e., by reducing its water content through heat or other processes) andto stabilize the sludge (i.e., by reducing or eliminating pathogenic organisms,odors, and volatile solids). Such processes improve the characteristicsof the sludge for a particular disposal method and reduce the potentialfor public health, environmental, and nuisance problems. EPA requires theuse of one or more of the treatment processes to reduce or kill pathogensbefore applying sewage sludge to land for agricultural and non-agriculturalpurposes, before distributing and marketing the sewage sludge, or beforethe disposal of sewage sludge in monofills or on surface disposal sites.EPA is not specifying process operating methods or requirements for sludgeentering or leaving a particular treatment process. The Agency believesthat section 405(d) requires EPA to develop regulations for the final useor disposal of sewage sludge and that Congress did not intend for EPA toimpose requirements on sludge processing as a part of the comprehensiveregulation for sludge use and disposal. Rather, the Agency believes thatsection 405(d) requires EPA to establish a ``standard of quality'' againstwhich treatment works can measure the quality of their sludge_its pollutantconcentrations_and determine (1) if further processing is needed, (2) ifadditional treatment limits should be imposed on its industrial dischargers,or (3) if the community should identify alternative practices for the safemanagement of its sludge. If, however, comments on these proposed rulesindicate sufficient justification for establishing standards for sludgeprocessing, EPA will consider such comments for future rulemaking proceedings.Relationship to Other Requirements (andSection; 503.2)As required by section 405(f) of the CWA, the requirements proposed todayare to be implemented through permits. The pollutant limits, managementpractices, and other requirements specified for a particular end use ordisposal method are to be included in the POTW's or generator's permit.The implementing permit mechanisms and the State program management requirementsare described in Part X of this preamble.State Authority (andSection; 503.3)Anyone using or disposing of sewage sludge is obligated to comply withthe requirements proposed today. However, as provided in section 405(d)(5)and section 510 of the CWA, States may impose more stringent requirementsthan those included in today's proposal.Exclusions (andSection; 503.4)This section of the proposal lists the methods of sewage sludge use ordisposal that are not covered by today's proposed rule. In this portionof the preamble, the Agency discusses its rationale for these exclusions.<ITAG tagnum="81">Industrial Sewage Sludge</ITAG>The proposed rule will not cover the use or disposal of sewage sludge thatis generated by privately owned treatment facilities treating domesticsewage along with industrial waste and wastewater. Such sludge will continueto be covered by rules promulgated under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act (RCRA) (40 CFR Parts 261 through 268) or under SubtitleD of RCRA (40 CFR Parts 257 and 258).The Water Quality Act amendments of 1987 expanded the coverage of section405(d) to industrial manufacturing and private processing facilities thattreat domestic sewage along with industrial wastes and wastewater. Althoughthe legislative history of the Act clearly directs the Agency to imposerequirements on any treatment work treating domestic sewage, and not justtreatment works ``primarily'' treating domestic sewage (see 99th Cong.2d Sess., H.R. Rept. 99-1004, October 15, 1986, p. 160), passage of theamendments in February, 1987 did not provide sufficient time to collectthe data necessary to develop standards for such facilities in today'sproposal.At this time, the Agency does not have sufficient information on the characteristicsof industrial sludge with a domestic sewage component to determine whetherthe models and data used to establish numerical limits for the use or disposalof municipal sewage sludge are appropriate for nonhazardous sludge generatedby industrial facilities. The Agency recognizes the need to collect additionalinformation on industrial wastes and on industrial waste disposal facilitiesas a basis for revising its regulations in 40 CFR Part 257 and for developing,if appropriate, additional regulations. As a first step in collecting additionalinformation, EPA proposed, in a separate rulemaking, that industrial facilitiesnotify the States and EPA of the volume of their sludge and the disposalmethods and locations used (see 53 FR 33314, August 30, 1988). Once theseand other data (e.g., viscosity, density, moisture content, and the organiccarbon content of industrial sludge with a domestic sewage content) havebeen collected, the Agency will determine whether today's proposal shouldapply or whether additional regulations should be developed for industrialfacilities that co-treat domestic sewage with industrial wastewater. TheAgency anticipates that any additional requirements for industrial facilitiestreating domestic sewage along with industrial waste and wastewater wouldbe developed under the joint authorities of sections 4004 and 4010 of RCRAand section 405(d) of the CWA.<ITAG tagnum="81">Hazardous Sewage Sludge</ITAG>The proposed rule will not establish standards for disposal of sewage sludgedetermined to be hazardous under 40 CFR Part 261. In previous <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices, EPA indicated it was considering excludingsewage sludge from regulation under RCRA Subtitle C once comprehensivesludge regulations were developed (see 51 FR 21658, June 1, 1986). Theexclusion would be based in part on section 1006(b) of RCRA, which states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Administrator shall integrate all provisions of this Act for purposesof administration and enforcement and shall avoid duplication to the maximumextent practicable, with appropriate provisions of the [CAA, CWA, FIFRA,SDWA, and MPRSA] and such other Acts of Congress as grant regulatory authorityto the Administrator. Such integration shall be effected only to the extentthat it can be done in a manner consistent with the goals and policiesexpressed in this Act and in other acts referred to in this subsection.</ITAG>However, rather than regulating both hazardous and nonhazardous sewagesludge under section 405(d) of the CWA, EPA has concluded it is appropriateto regulate all hazardous wastes, including sewage sludge, under a programspecifically designed for hazardous materials. The Agency believes thatthis provides the public with greater assurance of the consistent regulationand management of hazardous materials. It also provides a strong incentivefor any treatment work with hazardous sludge to improve the quality ofits sludge through effective pretreatment. Thus, the standards for thedisposal of sewage sludge in today's proposal apply only to non-hazardoussludge.In determining whether their sewage sludge is hazardous, treatment worksare to use procedures promulgated under 40 CFR Part 261, Appendix II. Ifthe sewage sludge is hazardous, treatment works generating the hazardoussludge must comply with the applicable requirements of 40 CFR Parts 260through 268. The Agency has made the determination that compliance withthe requirements in 40 CFR Parts 261 through 268 constitutes compliancewith section 405(d) of the CWA.In the Spring, EPA will promulgate amendments to 40 CFR Part 261. The amendmentswill include additional toxicants to be considered in defining a wasteas hazardous and introduce a new leaching procedure, the Toxicity CharacteristicLeaching Procedure (TCLP). The regulatory levels that will be in 40 CFRPart 261 are the regulatory levels that will be used in determining ifsewage sludge is hazardous.The pollutants covered by today's proposal and those covered by amendmentsto 40 CFR Part 261 are not identical. In this proposal, specific limitsare established for 17 pollutants for which there are no toxicity characteristicregulatory limits. The 17 pollutants are listed in Table IX-A.1. Thereare also toxicity characteristic regulatory limits for pollutants thatare not covered by today's proposal. The two lists are not identical becausethe programs under which the lists were developed start from fundamentallydifferent perspectives. The toxicity characteristic regulatory limits areset for chemicals that are still used or manufactured and are likely tofind their way to a landfill. The section 405(d) limits are establishedfor those metals and organic compounds that are found in sewage sludge,whether or not the metals and organic compounds are still used in industrialprocesses. To the extent necessary, the Agency will expand the toxicitycharacteristic list of pollutants and the pollutants covered by today'sproposal. Over time the lists of pollutants can be expected to overlapeven more, but they are never expected to be identical.<ITAG tagnum="84">Table IX-A.1_Section 405(d) Pollutants for Which There Are No ToxicityCharacteristic Regulatory Thresholds:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Aldrin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Benzidine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Benzo (a) pyrene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Beryllium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chlordane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Copper</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Cyanide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">DDT/DDD/DDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Dieldrin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Dimethylnitrosamine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Molybdenum</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Nickel</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Polychlorinated biphenyls</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Trichloroethlene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Zinc</ITAG>Several municipal wastewater agencies believe that the proposed TCLPs wouldresult in the classification of certain sewage sludge as hazardous. In1986 and 1987, EPA tested 18 municipal sewage sludge samples using thenew procedure and found that none failed. Although the results are preliminaryand represent only a small percentage of the 15,000 POTWs, the Agency believesthat municipal sewage sludge will generally pass the toxicity characteristicregulatory thresholds and be subject to the requirements in 40 CFR Part503 rather than the requirements in 40 CFR Parts 261-268.<ITAG tagnum="81">Incinerator Ash</ITAG>The requirements proposed today do not cover the disposal of ash generatedduring the incineration of sewage sludge. Rules previously promulgatedby the Agency in 40 CFR Part 261 through 268 and 40 CFR Part 257 and thoseproposed for 40 CFR Part 258 (see 53 FR 33314, August 30, 1988) adequatelycover the disposal of incinerator ash. Sewage sludge to which incineratorash has been added is covered by today's proposal. <ITAG tagnum="81">Co-disposal of Sewage Sludge</ITAG>Standards are not established in today's proposal for sewage sludge thatis disposed of in a landfill with municipal solid waste. Rather, thesestandards are established in 40 CFR Part 258 which will include requirementsfor the disposal of sewage sludge in a municipal solid waste landfill (MSWLF).Compliance by treatment works with requirements of 40 CFR Part 258 whenpromulgated would constitute compliance with section 405. The standardswere jointly proposed under the authorities of sections 4004 and 4010 ofRCRA and section 405(d) of the CWA in 53 FR 33314, August 30, 1988. To meet these standards, treatment works must ensure that the sewage sludgesent to MSWLFs is not hazardous, as defined by the regulatory limits in40 CFR Part 261, and pass the Paint Filter Liquids Test. As part of the August 30, 1988 notice, EPA made the determination thatthe proposed standards for MSWLFs meet the requirement of section 405(d)of the CWA that the Agency establish standards adequate to protect humanhealth or the environment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effectof each pollutant. Section 405(d)(3) of the CWA provides that the Agencymay promulgate design, equipment, management practice, or operational standardsor combinations thereof if, ``in the judgment of the Administrator, itis not feasible to prescribe or enforce a numerical limitation for a pollutant.* * *.''The Agency is proposing a single set of standards for a MSWLF in orderto avoid imposing two distinct sets of requirements on a single facility.If the Agency had proposed separate requirements under the two applicablestatutes, treatment works would not only have had to comply with whatevernumerical limits were established under Part 503, but would also be responsiblefor ensuring that the MSWLF complies with the Part 258 standards. Thiswould have placed an unfair burden on treatment works when other solidwaste contributors were not held similarly responsible. In lieu of holding treatment works responsible for the compliance of aMSWLF, the Agency is proposing today that treatment works send their sewagesludge to State-permitted facilities. EPA is soliciting comment on thisrequirement in recognition that few MSWLFs have State permits. The Agencyis interested in the potential effect of this requirement on the 6,700treatment works that send 41 percent (3.2 million dry metric tons) of allsewage sludge generated to MSWLFs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Co-firing Of Sewage Sludge</ITAG>Today's proposal will not apply to sewage sludge that is fired in an incineratorwith other solid waste. This excludes four facilities that currently firewaste streams consisting of between three and nine percent sewage sludge(on a dry weight basis). The New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for sewage treatment plants(see 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart O) apply to facilities when 10 percent ormore of their waste stream consists of sewage sludge (on a dry weight basis).However, this 10-percent threshold no longer appears appropriate. The configuration of systems firing municipal refuse are quite differentfrom those that fire only sewage sludge. Municipal waste combustors (MWCs)generally use mass burn, modular, or refuse-derived fuel systems. Facilitiesfiring sewage sludge most commonly use multiple hearth and fluidized bedsystems. A facility designed primarily for firing solid waste cannot efficientlyfire more than a small amount of sewage sludge because the highly aqueoussewage sludge reduces the combustion temperature of the incinerator. Ifa municipal solid waste stream includes 10 percent sewage sludge, whichis typically 80 percent water, the sewage sludge reduces the BTu valueof the waste stream by 30 percent. Therefore, from a technological standpoint,it is ill-advised for typical MWCs to fire a large volume of sewage sludge.Currently, the Agency is studying how best to regulate facilities co-firingsewage sludge with municipal solid waste. On July 7, 1987, the Agency issuedan advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (52 FR 2599) on revisions tothe NSPS for new or modified MWCs under section 111(b) of the CAA and onemission guidelines for existing MWCs under section 111(d) of the CAA.Section 111(b) applies to sources after a rule is proposed and Section111(d) applies to existing sources.1At this time, the Agency has not determinedhow it will regulate facilities co-firing sewage sludge with municipalsolid waste. In November 1989, the Agency anticipates that it will proposea NSPS for MWCs and will then address standards for sewage sludge in facilitiesthat co-fire municipal solid waste with sewage sludge. Any recommendationsor suggestions submitted as part of this rulemaking will be included inthe Agency's deliberations on the NSPS for MWCs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Deepwell Wet Air Oxidation System</ITAG>The proposed rule does not apply to the location or operation of deepwellwet air oxidation systems. In these systems, sewage sludge flows down thecenter of two concentric verticle tubes and returns in the annular space.These verticle tubes (about a mile in length) are placed deep within theearth. Oxygen is injected into the liquid sewage sludge where, deep withinthe well, sufficient pressures and temperatures are reached to supportthe oxidation of the sewage sludge. This continuous flow system convertsthe organic waste into inert ash, carbon dioxide, and water. The effluentfrom these systems could be recycled back into the waste treatment plantor discharged in accordance with a National Pollutant Discharge EliminationSystem (NPDES) permit. Because these are fully enclosed recycling systems,with no emissions to the air and controlled discharges, if any, to surfacewater, the Agency does not believe such systems are comparable to the useor disposal methods included in today's proposal. As these systems aredeveloped further, EPA will evaluate if it would be appropriate to developnumerical pollutant limits for the liquid sludge placed in and oxidizedin the wells. <ITAG tagnum="81">Septic Tanks</ITAG>Today's proposal will not apply to the location and operation of septictanks. Septic tanks are also excluded from the definition of ``treatmentworks'' because of Congressional intention that only treatment and processingof septage be subject to section 405 regulation. However, the septage collectedfrom septic systems is included in the definition of sewage sludge. Thus,septage must meet the requirements in today's proposal when it is ultimatelyused or disposed of. Septage is frequently collected and delivered to treatment works for processing,generally to reduce the levels of pathogenic organisms. However, otherseptage is collected and applied to the land without further processingor without monitoring the levels of pathogenic organisms. Under today'sproposal, sewage sludge, including septage, must meet the requirementsin Subpart F, if it is applied to the land. The Agency is soliciting commentof the effect of these requirements on the use or disposal of septage.<ITAG tagnum="81">Marine Sanitation Devices</ITAG>Today's proposal would only apply to the pumpings from marine sanitationdevices that are delivered to on-shore facilities for disposal. Generallythe pumpings are collected in tanks at marinas and delivered to treatmentworks. Requirements in 33 CFR Part 159 specify requirements for the operationand maintenance of marine sanitation devices. Definitions (andSection; 503.5)The definitions included in this section of the rule are those generallyapplicable to all subparts of the rule. Each subpart includes special definitionsthat apply only to that subpart. Many of the definitions included in SubpartA are definitions that are included in section 502 of the CWA or have beenincluded in numerous other Agency rules and will not be discussed here.The definitions discussed here amplify and reinforce the coverage of therule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Domestic Sewage</ITAG>Domestic sewage is wastewater generated in households that is dischargedto or otherwise enters a treatment work. Excluded from today's proposalis domestic sewage that privately owned treatment works treat along withindustrial waste and wastewater. <ITAG tagnum="81">Pollutant</ITAG>Pollutant is defined as:<ITAG tagnum="21">Those organic or inorganic substances or combination of substances,including disease-causing agents, which, after discharge and upon exposure,ingestion, inhalation, or assimilation into any organism, either directlyfrom the environment or indirectly by ingestion through the food-chain,will, on the basis of information available to the Administrator, causedeath, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutations, physiologicalmalfunctions (including malfunctions in reproduction), or physical deformationsin such organisms or their offspring.</ITAG>This definition is similar to the definition of ``toxic pollutant'' includedin section 502(13) of the CWA. The term, ``toxic pollutant'', is not usedin today's proposal because, over the years, that term has become synonymouswith the listed priority toxic pollutants included in section 307(a) ofthe CWA. EPA believes that Congress intended for the Agency to developstandards for a broader range of substances that might interfere with theuse or disposal of sewage sludge, not just those priority toxic pollutantsincluded in section 307(a).<ITAG tagnum="81">Septage</ITAG>In today's proposed rule, ``septage'' is included in the definition of``sewage sludge.'' Septage is defined to mean ``* * * the liquid and solidmaterial pumped from a septic tank, cesspool, or similar domestic sewagetreatment system when the system is cleaned''.This means that the disposal of septage by any method that would be regulatedunder today's proposal (e.g., applied to land, placed in a monofill orsurface disposal site) would be required to meet the applicable requirementsin the same manner as any other sewage sludge. For example, where septageis land-applied, the person doing the application would need to identifythe concentration of the pollutants in the septage regulated for land application(andSection; 503.13, Tables 1 and 2, for agricultural land; andSection; 503.15,Table 3 for non-agricultural land) and calculate the allowable annual andcumulative loading rates using the methods described in Appendices B andC. They would also be subject to all applicable management practices forland application. Users and disposers of septage (usually, septage haulers) would also berequired to meet the same pathogen reduction requirements as other usersand disposers of sludge. Current regulations for pathogen reduction (40CFR Part 257) assumes that septage applied to land meets a Process to SignificantlyReduce Pathogens if public access is controlled for 12 months and grazingby animals whose products are consumed by humans is prevented for one month.Today, for the reasons discussed in Subpart 7 of this part, EPA is proposingmore stringent requirements for septage.Today's proposal applies to the use and disposal of septage by one of themethods covered in this rule. It does not regulate the generation of septage(thus, owners of septic tanks are excluded from the definition of ``treatmentworks''), or the siting, design, or operation of septic tanks. Nor doestoday's proposal regulate septage that is transported to treatment works.Such practices are regulated under the pretreatment program. The sludgegenerated by the receiving treatment plant would be subject to requirementsproposed today.The Agency is proposing to regulate septage in the same way as sewage sludgebecause of growing concern about the potential adverse effects of applyingseptage to land. In addition, the qualities of septage are similar to sludge(they are both a residual of wastewater treatment). Under today's proposedapproach, the use and disposal of septage would be subject to the samerequirements as the use and disposal of other sewage sludge. The Agencyrecognizes that this may require that septage haulers have their septageprocessed prior to applying the septage on the land. EPA is unsure aboutthe extent and magnitude of any disruptions that today's approach may cause.Therefore, EPA invites comment on the proposed regulatory approach forseptage use and disposal.Specifically, the public is invited to comment on whether or not septageis sufficiently similar to sewage sludge and of sufficient concern to warrantthe same regulatory approach, particularly in terms of the proposed pathogenand vector attraction reduction requirements. Other possible regulatoryoptions might include developing separate standards specifically for septagedisposal that are tailored to the particular concerns presented by septage(e.g., pathogens and a narrower list of pollutants) and that might be simplerto apply. For example, rather than requiring the sampling of the septageand the calculation of loading rates, the rule could simply set a loadinglimit for septage. EPA solicits comments on the desirability or feasibilityof such an alternative approach. The Agency welcomes any suggestions concerningother possible approaches that the Agency should consider in regulatingseptage use and disposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">Sewage Sludge</ITAG>Today's proposal defines sewage sludge as any solid, semi-solid, or liquidresidue removed during the treatment of municipal wastewater or domesticsewage. Sewage sludge includes, but is not limited to, solids removed duringprimary, secondary, or advanced wastewater treatment, scum, septage, portabletoilet pumpings, Type III marine sanitation device pumpings, and sewagesludge products.Scum is the material that floats upward and must be skimmed off the topof the wastewater treatment tanks. Scum shares many characteristics withthe other residues generated during wastewater treatment and is typicallydisposed of with sewage sludge. Therefore, it is included in the definitionof sewage sludge.Septage, portable toilet pumpings, and Type III marine sanitation devicepumpings are included in the definition of sewage sludge because they sharethe characteristics of sewage sludge, are generated from domestic sewage,and present the same human health risks (e.g., pathogenic organisms) assludge from municipal treatment works.Sewage sludge products are mixtures of sewage sludge and other materials,such as bulking agents (e.g., wood chips), frequently added to sewage sludgethat is composted and then distributed and marketed. Such products areconsidered to be sewage sludge for the purposes of this proposal, no matterhow small the percentage of sewage sludge in the product. The Agency issoliciting comment on this approach to determine if there are sewage sludgeproducts that contain such a small percentage of sewage sludge that theyno longer have the characteristics of sewage sludge.Grit, screenings, or ash generated during the incineration of sewage sludgeare not included in the definition of sewage sludge. Grit is the material,such as sand, small pebbles, and similar material, that settles out beforeprimary treatment. Screenings are relatively large pieces of solid materialthat are caught on the screens at the headworks of the treatment plant.These waste streams are small, have vastly different properties from sewagesludge generated during wastewater treatment, are usually handled and disposedof separately, and are adequately regulated under solid waste programs.Ash generated during the incineration of sewage sludge is not includedin today's definition of sewage sludge. Incinerator ash, typically disposedof in landfills, like other ash material is sterile and dry. Incineratorash does not have the same characteristics as other residues from wastewatertreatment. As discussed above, incinerator ash will be regulated underRCRA (i.e., under Subtitle D if it is non-hazardous and under SubtitleC if it is hazardous). If, however, incinerator ash is mixed and disposedof with other sewage sludge (e.g., in land application), it will be regulatedas sewage sludge.<ITAG tagnum="81">Treatment Works</ITAG>Treatment works include POTWs owned by State or local entities and federallyowned facilities. All sewage sludge generated by these POTWs are coveredby today's proposal, irrespective of the amount of industrial influentflowing into the treatment works.Privately owned treatment works may include commercial processing facilitiesthat treat domestic sewage. If privately owned treatment works treat domesticsewage exclusively, the sewage sludge generated is covered by today's proposal.However, if the privately owned treatment work treats domestic sewage alongwith industrial waste and wastewater, the sewage sludge is excluded fromtoday's proposal. As discussed earlier, EPA is not prepared, at this time,to propose standards for the use or disposal of such sludge which, pendingdevelopment of standards, continues to be subject to the requirements in40 CFR Part 257 or 40 CFR Parts 261 through 268.For the purposes of this rule, septic systems are excluded from the definitionof treatment works. Although septic systems treat domestic sewage, theAgency has no intention of permitting individual owners of septic systems.As discussed above, the ultimate use or disposal of the septage pumpedfrom septic tanks will be covered by today's proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Land Application (Subpart B)</ITAG>Applicability (andSection; 503.10)The numerical limits, management practices, and other requirements in SubpartB apply to the spreading of liquid, de-watered, dried, or composted sewagesludge on or just below the surface of agricultural and non-agriculturalland. The requirements also apply to any one who distributes or who usessewage sludge meeting the numerical limits in this subpart. Sewage sludgewhich is distributed and marketed for use as a potting medium, or lawns,ornamentals and gardens in compliance with Subpart C is not subject tothe requirements of this subpart. Treatment works with good quality sludge are encouraged to reuse the sewagesludge for its nutrient and soil conditioning properties. Subpart B requirementsprotect public health and the environment while encouraging the beneficialuse of sewage sludge by providing options on the level of pathogen reductionthat must be achieved and on the pollutant concentrations that may be presentin sludge applied to the land. Treatment works may use any one of three levels of pathogen reduction whensewage sludge is applied to either agricultural or non-agricultural landas long as the treatment work or applier complies with the applicable restrictionson public access to the land and on growing crops or raising animals onthe sludge-amended soil. In addition, two sets of numerical limits areincluded in this part. The applicability of these limits depend on whetherthe sewage sludge is used in the production of crops intended, directlyor indirectly, for human consumption or for animals raised for human consumption.In this way, the Agency believes that it is encouraging the reuse of sewagesludge while also protecting public health from the adverse effects ofpathogenic infections and of chemical contamination of the food-chain.One key difference between the requirements of Subpart B and Subpart C(distribution and marketing) is the level of pathogen reduction to whicha treatment work must process its sludge. Treatment works that distributeand market their sewage sludge to the general public must process theirsludge to attain the Class A pathogen reduction standard_the highest levelof pathogen reduction (i.e., reduce pathogens below levels of detection).Because sewage sludge that meets the Class A pathogen reduction standarddoes not pose a risk of an infectious dose, no access restrictions or restrictionson the growing or harvesting of food crops are imposed. Such restrictionswould not be feasible for sewage sludge that is distributed and marketedto the general public. In contrast, the land application subpart allowstreatment works the option of selecting alternative pathogen reductionstandards, Classes B and C, as long as the landowner imposes public accessand animal grazing controls and restricts the growing and harvesting ofcrops in accordance with the standards of the class of pathogen reductionselected. Another difference between the requirements in Subparts B and C are thenumerical limits for some of the organic pollutants and some metals whensewage sludge is applied to agricultural land and when sewage sludge isdistributed and marketed. In both scenarios it is assumed that the sewagesludge is used in the production of crops intended for human consumption.The numerical limits for the application of sewage sludge to agriculturalland are based on crops intended for direct human consumption or fed toanimals intended for direct human consumption, whichever is the more stringentloading rate. For the organic pollutants, which tend to bioaccumulate throughthe food chain, the limiting numerical limit is based on crops fed to animalsintended for human consumption. As explained in Subpart C, the distributionand marketing scenario is designed to protect a fruit and vegetable homegarden, not a garden in which feed is raised for animals intended for humanconsumption. Therefore, the numerical limits for organic pollutants indistribution and marketing tend to be higher than those for agriculturalland application. The third major difference in the requirements between Subparts B and Cis that for the requirements in Subpart B to apply, there must be an agreementbetween the treatment work and the distributor or applier of the sewagesludge to abide by the requirements in Subpart B, such as the access anduse restrictions. If there are no agreements and sewage sludge is appliedto the land, treatment works must comply with the requirements for thedistribution and marketing of sewage sludge in Subpart C.In developing the requirements for the land application of sewage sludge,the Agency assumed that, except for the applier, there would be littlepublic contact with the sewage sludge itself or with the land receivingthe sewage sludge. EPA also assumed that public access restrictions couldbe imposed on either agricultural or non-agricultural land for a periodof time. The underlying premise in developing sewage sluge distributionand marketing requirements was that the sluge would be used in a home gardenwhere there would be immediate and continuous human contact with the sewagesludge or with the land receiving it. Under such circumstances, the Agencycould not restrict access.As discussed earlier in the preamble, Part 503 does not apply to sewagesludge that is determined to be hazardous or to sewage sludge that containsPolychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) in conentrations equal to or greater than50 parts per million (ppm). Such sludge is regulated under Subtitle C ofRCRA and under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Amendments to 40CFR 761.20 (53 FR 24220, June 27, 1988) specifically exclude the land applicationof PCB-contaminated sewage sludge from the prohibition on using PCBs (regardlessof the concentration), except in a totally enclosed manner, when the sewagesludge use is regulated under CWA and RCRA. This amendment codified theAgency's traditional practice of deferring to programs other than thoseof TSCA when regulating materials with less than 50 ppm of PCBs.Specialized Definitions (andSection; 503.11)In this section of the proposal, the Agency defines and clarifies termsthat it uses throughout this subpart or in other definitions. Not all ofthe terms in andSection; 503.11 will be discussed in the order in which theyare listed in the rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">Agricultural Land</ITAG>The Agency estimates that approximately 25 percent of the sewage sludgethat is generated by POTWs is applied to the land and that 77 percent ofthe sewage sludge applied to the land (approximately 926,000 million drymetric tons) is used to improve the condition and nutrient content of agriculturallands. The definition of agricultural land includes land on which cropsor animals are raised for human consumption (e.g., pastures for the grazingof animals). This beneficial reuse of sewage sludge has been and continuesto be an Agency priority.The numerical limits, management practices, and other requirements foragricultural land are applicable if sewage sludge is applied to lands onwhich the applier grows his or her food or grows food for others. For example,the requirements for agricultural lands apply to pastures used for deerthat are raised for subsequent sale or for deer hunts, whereas the requirementsfor non-agricultural land would apply to land where deer may graze as longas the hunting of the deer is prohibited.<ITAG tagnum="81">Non-Agricultural Land</ITAG>Non-agricultural land is defined as land on which neither food nor animalfeed crops (including pastures) are grown. Example of non-agriculturallands include lands used for forests or turf farming, lands reclaimed formore productive purposes (i.e., lands devastated by fires, strip mining,etc.), and lands dedicated to sludge disposal.The beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is not limited to the growing offood-chain crops. Sewage sludge applied to forest lands shortens wood productioncycles and increases yields, especially on marginally-productive lands.Marginally-productive lands and lands suffering from poor soil stabilityand severe water and wind erosion can be stabilized and put to more productiveuses through the application of sewage sludge and the establishment ofa vegetative cover. For example, strip-mined areas and constructive siteshave been reclaimed for use as wildlife sanctuaries and parks.Lands dedicated to sludge disposal are usually owned or controlled by thetreatment work. The objective of this practice is to employ the land asa treatment system by using soil to bind the metals and allow soil microorganisms,sunlight, and oxidation to destroy the organic matter in the sludge. Vegetativecovers are established on these lands to preclude the runoff of sludgewith soil and water. Although intensive management is required, this maystill be less costly than other sewage sludge use or disposal practicesin areas where land is available.No food or feed crops may be grown or animals intended for human consumptionraised on non-agricultural lands during the application of sewage sludgeor for 5 years after the final application of sewage sludge. This shouldencourage treatment works to use the soil conditioning properties and nutrientcontents of the sewage sludge without concern about the effect of higherpollutant concentrations on the food-chain.<ITAG tagnum="81">Annual Pollutant Loading Rate</ITAG>The annual pollutant loading rate is the amount of an organic chemical(in kilograms) that can be applied to a hectare of land (2.5 acres) ina 365-consecutive-day period. The annual pollutant loading rates applyto organic pollutants and is one of two pollutant limits for sewage sludgeused in agricultural land. The other pollutant limit is the cumulativepollutant loading rate for metals.Table 1 in andSection; 503.13 of the proposed rule lists the annual pollutantloading rates for 15 organic pollutants covered by today's proposal. Theannual pollutant loading rate, derived from the exposure assessment model,ensures that the amount of a pollutant reaching a target organism doesnot exceed the human health or environmental criterion for that organism.For humans, the criterion is a carcinogenic potency value (Q<T2>1</T2>* value) because the 15 organic pollutants in Table 1 are allcarcinogens. The Q<T2>1</T2>* values are listed in the Agency's Integrated Risk InformationSystem (IRIS). For plants and animals, the criteria are toxicity valuesderived from the scientific literature and are listed in the ``TechnicalSupport Document: Land Application and Distribution and Marketing of SewageSludge'' (Reference number 57).As discussed in Part IV of the preamble, a key assumption in establishingan annual pollutant loading rate is that organic pollutants decompose accordingto first-order kinetics. In other words, the quantity of a pollutant decomposingor lost each year is directly proportional to the quantity present in thesoil. This means that when a pollutant is applied at a steady rate formany years, the soil concentration approaches a plateau at which the rateof loss equals the rate of application. The annual pollutant loading rateis established to ensure that the long-term pollutant concentration inthe soil is below a concentration that would exceed a human health criterion(i.e., equal to an incremental carcinogenic risk of 1andmultiply;10^4) ifthe plant absorbing the pollutant is eaten. For pathways involving thedirect ingestion of a sludge-soil mixture by children or by grazing animals,the model builds in the half-life of a pollutant, particularly for persistentorganic pollutants such as PCBs.  The Agency has developed a procedure and an equation to determine the amountof a sludge that may be applied each year without exceeding the pollutants'annual loading rates. The procedure is spelled out in Appendix B of theproposed rule and is explained in connection with the discussion of thepollutant limits later in this subpart of the preamble.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Cumulative Pollutant Loading Rate  </ITAG>The cumulative pollutant loading rate is the maximum amount of a pollutantthat can be applied to the land without exceeding a human health or environmentalcriterion when the pollutant reaches a target organism. An exposure assessmentmodel is used to establish a cumulative pollutant loading rate for eachof the 10 inorganic pollutants listed in Table 2 of andSection; 503.13. The exposure assessment model incorporates two key assumptions. The firstis that the background metal concentration corresponds to an average backgroundvalue for rural agricultural lands (Reference number 57). The second isthat over a period of time, the metals adhere to the sludge-soil matrixand do not become more available to plants. The Agency also assumed thatthe amount of metal absorbed by a plant is a function of the total metalin the soil and that absorption by a plant is determined by the total metalin the soil.  The Agency recognizes that not all of the metal is in a form that can beabsorbed by the plant. Only the leachable portion of the metal is availablefor absorption. Since there is insufficient data to determine the percentageof absorbable metal in a sludge-soil matrix, the Agency assumed that allof the metal is available to the plant. The Agency has initiated work todevelop an index to correlate total metal in a sludge-soil matrix to thepercentage absorbed by a plant. The percentage of the metal that is actuallyavailable for absorption by a plant could significantly affect the amountof metal that may be applied to the land without causing adverse humanhealth or environmental effects, particularly if it is a small amount.The Agency is soliciting data on the dissolved and bound portions of metalsin a sludge-soil matrix to assist it in determining the amount availableto a plant.  The cumulative pollutant loading rate is the total amount of the pollutant,in kilograms per hectare (kg/ha), that can be added to the background concentrationalready in the soil without exceeding a human health or environmental criterionwhen the pollutant reaches the target organism. None of the 10 inorganicpollutants is a carcinogenic when ingested. Therefore, except for arsenicand lead, the Agency used the reference dose (RfD) from IRIS as the humanhealth criteria. Arsenic and lead are not listed in IRIS.  In the case of arsenic, EPA derived a daily dietary intake (DDI) from themaximum contaminant level (MCL). For lead, however, the Agency believedthat the existing MCL (50 micrograms per liter) was too high a thresholdon which to base a DDI. Therefore, as explained earlier in Part V of thepreamble, the Agency derived a DDI on the basis of the amount of lead whichcould be in food without an adult white male exceeding a blood lead levelof 10 micrograms per deciliter (10 andCx.18;g/dl). Using this approach limitsthe cumulative pollutant loading rate of lead to 176 kg/ha. However, anenvironmental pathway (bird eating earthworms) limits the cumulative pollutantloading rate to 125 kg/ha, which, as the more stringent limit, was usedby the Agency. The numerical limit of 125 kg/ha is significantly lowerthan the median regulatory range of 530 kilograms per hectare in the 32States that have established cumulative loading rates for lead. In theseStates, the cumulative pollutant loading rates range from 200 to 2520 kilogramsper hectare. Current EPA guidance suggests that lead should not be appliedat a cumulative pollutant loading rate in excess of 500 to 2,000 kg/ha.The proposed limit of 125 kg/ha will result in significant reductions.As noted earlier in the preamble, the Agency is soliciting comment on theimpact of this limit on the beneficial reuse of sewage sludge and on thepotential intermedia transfer of lead risks.  The Agency has developed a procedure and an equation to determine the numberof years that sewage sludge can be applied to the land without exceedingthe cumulative pollutant loading rates. The procedure and equation arespelled out in Appendix C of the proposal and are explained in connectionwith the discussion of the numerical limits.  Land Application_General Requirements (andSection; 503.12)  Sewage sludge applied to the land must be applied in accordance with therequirements in Subpart B of the rule. All individuals who apply sewagesludge to the land (as opposed to individuals applying a ``sewage sludgeproduct'' that is distributed or marketed, see Subpart C) must comply withthe requirements.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Agreements  </ITAG>Before sewage sludge may be applied to the land by anyone other than thetreatment work, the treatment work must enter into an agreement with thedistributor or applier of the sewage sludge. This agreement may be in theform of a performance agreement, a contract, or another similar instrumentand must provide that the distributor or applier will meet the requirementsin Subpart B of the rule. Thirty-eight States currently require agreementswhen sewage sludge is applied to the land.  The agreement between POTWs and distributors and appliers is a mechanismfor ensuring the distributors and appliers are aware of the obligation,under section 405(e), to dispose of sewage sludge in accordance with theSection 405 technical standards. That obligation arises directly from thestatute, not because of the existence of contractual relationship betweenthe POTW and distributor or appliers. Moreover, the requirement to useand dispose of sewage sludge in accordance with the technical standardsis directly enforceable by EPA under the statute. Section 405(e) makesit clear that it is unlawful to dispose of sludge for any use for whichregulations have been established, except in accordance with the regulations. The Agency is interested in specifying only the minimum number of elementsneeded in an agreement to assure compliance with the rule and will carefulyconsider suggestions to add or delete any elements to simplify the agreement.The Agency is particularly interested in the effect the agreements wouldhave on small farmers and whether the agreements would discourage the useof sewage sludge in farming operations.General provisions to be included in written agreements for both agriculturallands and non-agricultural lands are discussed first, followed by the particularprovisions directed at sewage sludge that is applied to agricultural landsand to non-agricultural lands. 1. <T3>General Provisions. </T3>All agreements, whether with a sewage sludgedistributor or applier, are to provide the following information: andbullet; Name and address of person(s) receiving and applying the sewagesludge;andbullet; Location(s) and legal description of the site(s) to which thesludge will be applied;andbullet; Size(s) of the sites (or portion thereof) to which the sludgewill be applied, in hectares or acres;andbullet; The nitrogen concentration of the sewage sludge;andbullet; Amount of sewage sludge to be applied to each site, in metrictons;andbullet; Class of pathogen reduction used in the sewage sludge and theapplicable use and access restrictions set forth in 40 CFR 503.52 for thatclass of pathogen reduction;andbullet; Vector attraction reduction used in treating the sewage sludge;andbullet; Period of time after receipt within which the sewage sludge mustbe applied;andbullet; Application method to be used (i.e., injection below the surfaceof the soil, spraying, surface application, etc.) and whether or not thesludge is to be incorporated into the soil; andandbullet; Storage method to be used in case of inclement weather and publichealth and environmental protective practices to be used until the sludgeis applied. This agreement also must contain prohibitions on the following:andbullet; Application of sewage sludge at rates in excess of the nitrogenrequirements of the vegetation and at rates that would cause the excessnitrogen to leach to the ground water;andbullet; Application of sewage sludge to the land if such application willcause or contribute to the harm of an endangered or threatened speciesof plant, fish, or wildlife, will result in the destruction or adversemodification of the critical habitat of the endangered or threatened species,will restrict the flow of the base flood, or will reduce the temporarywater storage capacity of the floodplain;andbullet; Application of sewage sludge to frozen, snow-covered, or floodedland, unless it will not cause a discharge of pollutants into waters ofthe United States, including wetlands, that violates any requirement ofthe CWA; andandbullet; Application of sewage sludge to any land that is 10 meters (30feet) or less from a surface water. 2. <T3>Provisions For Agricultural Lands. </T3>In addition to the generalprovisions, these agreements must also include the following requirementswhenever sewage sludge is applied to agricultural lands:andbullet; Concentration of the pollutants listed in Tables 1 and 2 of 40CFR 503.13;andbullet; Prohibition on applying sewage sludge in amounts greater than50 metric tons per hectare (on a dry weight basis);andbullet; Amount of sewage sludge, in metric tons per hectare, that maybe applied in a 365-consecutive-day-period without exceeding the annualpollutant loading rates in Table 1 of 40 CFR 503.13 (using procedures inAppendix B of 40 CFR Part 503 to determine the appropriate whole sludgeapplication rate); and Number of years that sewage sludge may be applied to the land without exceedingthe pollutant loading rates in Table 2 of 40 CFR 503.13 (using proceduresin Appendix C of 40 CFR Part 503 to determine the number of years thatsewage sludge may be applied to the land). Note that if the quality of the sludge changes, the amount of sludge thatmay be applied to the land also changes. If sludge quality improves, morecould be applied to the land, provided that the increment does not exceedthe nitrogen requirements of the crops. However, if the sludge qualitybecomes worse, less sludge may be applied to the land to avoid exceedingthe numerical limits in Tables 1 and 2 in andSection; 503.13. 3. <T3>Provision For Non-Agricultural Lands. </T3>In addition to the generalprovisions, agreements must also establish the following requirements wheneversewage sludge is applied to non-agricultural lands:andbullet; Concentrations of the pollutants in Table 3 of 40 CFR 503.15;andbullet; Prohibition on growing food or feed crops on the land during theperiod when sewage sludge is applied to that land and for 5 years afterthe final application of sewage sludge;andbullet; Prohibition on grazing animals on the land during the period whensewage sludge is applied to that land and for 5 years after the final applicationof sewage sludge;andbullet; Requirement that a vegetative cover be established on the land;andandbullet; Prohibition on public access to the land to which sewage sludgemeeting the Class A pathogen reduction requirements has been applied, untila vegetative cover has been established. Each of the provisions in the agreement relates to a specific requirementin the rule and will be discussed in connection with the requirement. Theagreement will also require submission of all the information a treatmentwork will need to comply with the monitoring, record keeping, and reportingrequirements included in today's proposal. The Agency recognizes that the portion of the agreement dealing with agriculturallands does not address the issue of an individual who receives sewage sludgefrom more than a single source. If individuals were to receive sewage sludgefrom more than one source, potentially more sewage sludge could be appliedin a year to a parcel of land than would be authorized by the annual pollutantloading rates in Table 1. Of greater concern, however, is that over time,an individual receiving sewage sludge from multiple sources could exceedthe cumulative pollutant loading rates for the metals listed in Table 2.The Agency does not know if individuals frequently receive their sewagesludge from more than one source. Some States do keep records of individualsreceiving sewage sludge, and these States may be able to identify thoseindividuals. EPA is interested in comments on whether the practice of receivingsewage sludge from more than one source is so prevalent that modificationsshould be made in the agreements to require that individuals identify allsources from which they are receiving or have received sewage sludge andnotify the POTWs when they receive sludge from a new source.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other General Requirements </ITAG>Some of the general requirements in today's proposal are taken from the``Criteria For Classification of Solid Waste Disposal Facilities and Practices''(40 CFR Part 257). These requirements are to ensure that the land applicationof sewage sludge does not contribute to adverse human health or environmentaleffects. Specifically, today's rule proposes that sewage sludge appliedto the land shall not cause or contribute to the harm of an endangeredor threatened species and shall not result in the destruction or adversemodification of the critical habitat of such species. Other 40 CFR Part257 requirements in today's proposal also include the following floodplainrestrictions: (1) Sewage sludge shall not restrict the flow of a base flood(i.e., a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of recurring inany year or a flood of a magnitude equalled or exceeded once in 100 years);(2) it shall not reduce the temporary water storage capacity of the floodplain;and (3) washout of sewage sludge shall not pose a hazard to human health,wildlife, or land or water resources. Twenty-three States have similarfloodplain restrictions.As a supplement to these provisions, the Agency is proposing to prohibitthe application of sewage sludge to frozen, snow-covered, or flooded landunless the applier demonstrates that the sewage sludge can be applied ina manner that will not cause a discharge of pollutants into waters of theUnited States, including wetlands, that violates any requirement of theCWA. There is every reason to assume that sewage sludge applied to frozen,snow-covered, or flooded lands would readily be transported off the sitewith the first melt or rainfall into a river, stream, or lake. Twenty-sixStates impose similar restrictions on the land application of sewage sludge.The Agency is interested in the experiences of those who have successfullyapplied sewage sludge to frozen, snow-covered, or flooded lands and thetechniques that were used to prevent the sewage sludge from reaching ariver, stream, or lake. Such information will assist the Agency in developingguidance on the type of demonstrations that should be made.Agricultural Land_National Pollutant Limits (andSection; 503.13) <ITAG tagnum="81">Pollutants </ITAG>EPA is proposing numerical limits for a total of 25 pollutants when sewagesludge is applied to the land. Table III-1 in the preamble lists the pollutantsthat were originally evaluated. Nitrogen and phosphorus were not included.The Agency believes that if sewage sludge is applied in accordance withthe nutrient requirements of the plant, nitrogen and phosphorus would notbe applied in sufficient quantities to adversely affect ground water orsurface water. The Agency may consider modeling nitrogen and phosphorus,if comments on the proposal suggest that good agronomic practices generallyhave not been followed, particularly for non-agricultural lands.Table III-2 of the preamble lists the pollutants that do not interferewith the land application of sewage sludge at the concentration shown in``Fate of Priority Pollutants in Publicly Owned Treatment Works'' (the``40 City Study''). The Agency determined that, even under the worst combinationof circumstances, cyanide, fluoride, iron, and pentachlorophenol do notinterfere with the land application of sewage sludge. As shown in Table12 of andSection; 503.72, the Agency would authorize removal credits forthese pollutants when sewage sludge is applied to the land. Table III-3 lists the pollutants that were originally evaluated, but forwhich numerical limits are not included in today's proposal due to insufficientdata or because the Agency has not established a human health criterionfor the pollutant. These pollutants may be considered in future rulemakingproceedings if sufficient information becomes available. Tables 1 and 2 in andSection; 503.13 of the proposed rule list the pollutantsand numerical limits for sewage sludge application to agricultural lands.Table 3 in andSection; 503.15 lists the pollutants and numerical limits forsewage sludge application to non-agricultural lands. The pollutants inTables 1, 2, and 3 are among the pollutants that are eligible for removalcredits when sewage sludge is applied to the land. Treatment works whosesludge meets the pollutant limits in these tables may issue removal creditsto their industrial users if the treatment work is eligible to do so underthe provisions in 40 CFR Part 403.As discussed in Part VIII of the preamble, the Agency used a differentapproach in establishing numerical limits for sewage sludge applied toagricultural lands from that used for non-agricultural lands. In establishingthe numerical limits for agricultural lands, the Agency used the exposureassessment models to limit the potential for individuals to receive a highlevel of pollutant exposure through their diet. For non-agricultural lands,where there is little likelihood that pollutants will reach individualsthrough their diets, the Agency used current sludge quality (i.e., the98th-percentile pollutant concentration shown in the ``40 City Study''),unless the exposure assessment models for agricultural lands calculateda higher numerical limit. In the latter case, the pollutant limit is basedon the exposure assessment model.Figure IX-B.1 shows how the pollutant limits, pathogen and vector attractionreduction requirements, and management practices determine whether or notsewage sludge may be applied to agricultural land. Each of these factorsis discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2283 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Annual Pollutant Loading Rate</ITAG>The annual pollutant loading rates for organic pollutants are listed inTable 1 of the proposal. The concentration of the organic pollutant inthe sewage sludge controls the annual rate at which sludge may be appliedto the land (i.e., the annual whole sludge application rate) because theannual pollutant loading rate remains constant with the annual whole sludgeapplication rate. As the pollutant concentration increases, the annualwhole sludge application rate decreases and vice versa. The annual wholesludge application rate is determined using the following equation:<ITAG tagnum="26">APLR=Candmultiply;0.001andmultiply;AWSAR      (1)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">APLR=Annual pollutant loading rate, in kilograms per hectare per year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C=Pollutant concentration in sewage sludge, in milligrams per kilogram(dry weight basis).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">AWSAR=Annual whole sludge application rate, in metric tons per hectare,per year (dry weight basis).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">0.001=Converts milligrams per kilogram times metric tons per hectareto kilograms per hectare.</ITAG>To determine the pollutant concentration in sewage sludge the equationis rearranged as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,2,2,14,r25,3</C> <H1>C</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>APLR</H1><H2>0.001andmultiply;AWSAR</H2><H1> </H1><H1>(2)</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>The annual whole sludge application rate would be determined by the pollutantconcentration that gives the lowest whole sludge application rate. AppendixB of the rule explains in more detail the procedures for determining theannual whole sludge application rate and provides an example.<ITAG tagnum="81">Cumulative Pollutant Loading Rate</ITAG>The cumulative pollutant loading rate is listed on Table 2 of the proposal.To determine the number of years sewage sludge may be applied to the land,the following equation would be used:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,2,2,6,r25,3</C> <H1>Y</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>CPLR</H1><H2>APLR</H2><H1> </H1><H1>(3)</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Y=Number of years that sewage sludge may be applied to the land.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CPLR=Cumulative pollutant loading rate, from Table 2 of the proposedrule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">APLR=Annual pollutant loading rate, derive from equation (1) of thissubpart of the preamble.</ITAG>The pollutant with the lowest number of years at a given annual pollutantloading rate or annual whole sludge application rate determines the numberof years for sludge application. Appendix C of the rule explains in detailthe procedure for determining the number of years that sludge may be appliedto the land and provides an example.In Part IV of the preamble, the Agency discusses the key assumptions inthe exposure assessment models and asks for public review and comment onthe data used in developing the models. The data used in the models aretabulated in the ``Technical Support Document: Land Application and Distributionand Marketing'' (Reference number 57). Part XIII describes how copies ofthe exposure assessment models may be obtained.The ``Technical Support Document: Land Application and Distribution andMarketing'' also contains a matrix showing the 14 pathways of exposureand the pathway for each pollutant that determines the pollutant limit.The pathway that results in the most stringent numerical limit is not alwaysthe pathway in which human health protection is the objective. In somecases, an animal or plant toxicity value may be the most stringent. Aldrin,dieldrin, and lead limits, for example, are derived based on the pathwayin which predators eat soil biota. Chromium and zinc limits are derivedfrom phytotoxicity values. The Agency believes that the pollutant limitsshould protect both human health and the environment, but recognizes thatsome may question whether factors other than human health should controlthe numerical limits in an agricultural setting. EPA is soliciting commenton this question.<ITAG tagnum="81">Changes to Cadmium and PCBs</ITAG>This proposal establishes numerical limits for cadmium and PCBs that aredifferent from the limits in 40 CFR 257.3-5(a). Section 257.3-5(a) establishesannual and cumulative numerical limits for cadmium based on a soil pH of6.5 or greater and varying milliequivalents of soil cation exchange capacity.As explained earlier, today's proposal does not establish an annual pollutantloading rate for cadmium because the rate at which a metal is applied tothe land is less important than the total amount of the metal applied toa specific site.The Agency is proposing a 18 kilogram per hectare cumulative pollutantloading rate for cadmium. The 40 CFR 257.3-5(a) rule established a cumulativepollutant loading rate of between 5 and 20 kilograms per hectare, dependingon the soil cation exchange capacity.There are several reasons for the differences in the numbers. First, recentresearch shows that soil cation exchange capacity does not affect the plant'sabsorption of cadmium when cadmium is in a sludge-soil matrix (Referencenumber 26). Although previous experiments had shown a direct relationshipbetween the milliequivalent of soil cation exchange capacity and plantabsorption of cadmium, these experiments had used the more bioavailablesoluble cadmium salts (CdCl<T2>2</T2>) rather than the cadmium present in sewage sludge. Metals insewage sludge tend to remain bound to the organic matrix so that not allof the metal is absorbed by the plant.Another reason for the differences in the cadmium cumulative pollutantloading rates is that today's proposal assumes a soil pH of 6, rather thana soil pH of 6.5. At the time 40 CFR 257.3-5(a) was issued, data indicatedthat a soil pH of 6.5 or greater was necessary to minimize plant absorptionof cadmium for food-chain crops. A more recent review of available dataindicates that metal absorption by plants at a pH of 5.7-6.0 is the sameas at a pH of 6.4 or greater (Reference numbers 71 and 72).The Agency believes that basing cadmium's cumulative loading rate on asoil pH of 6 and a toxicity value using lettuce leaf absorption of cadmium(lettuce has a strong tendency to accumulate cadmium) will adequately protectpublic health and preclude phytotoxic effects. However, the Agency continuesto evaluate data and welcomes additional data on the effect of differentsoil pH on plant absorption of metals from a sludge-soil matrix.The limits in 40 CFR 257.3-5(b) for PCBs are based on a concentration ofPCBs in sewage sludge or on a level of PCBs in animal feed or milk. Today'sproposal uses the exposure assessment models to establish a numerical limitfor PCBs that take into account PCB bioaccumulation in plants and animals.Therefore, the Agency believes that today's approach is more appropriatefor establishing a numerical limit for PCBs.The proposed numerical limit for PCBs in Table 1 is more restrictive thanthe Agency's PCB Cleanup Policy for residential areas where soil cleanupmust not exceed 10 ppm with a 10-inch cap of soil of less than 1 ppm (40CFR 761.125(c)(4)(v)). The Cleanup Policy limit for acceptable soil containmentlevels is based on soil ingestion, inhalation, and ground water contamination.The Cleanup Policy is not based on food-chain pathways, a particularlyimportant pathway for the land application of sewage sludge to agriculturallands. The critical application of sewage sludge to agricultural land isa grazing animal that is used for meat and animal products because of thebioaccumulation of PCBs through the food-chain.<ITAG tagnum="81">Alternatives to National Numerical Limits</ITAG>The Agency is proposing national numerical limits for the pollutants inTables 1 and 2. There is no provision for case-by-case use of site-specificdata to calculate alternative pollutant limits as there is for the disposalof sewage sludge in a monofill or for the incineration of sewage sludge.EPA adopted the approach of proposing only national numerical limits forthe application of sewage sludge to agricultural lands because the Agencydid not find that changes in site parameters made a significant differencein the numerical limits when it performed sensitivity analyses on the siteparameters. As discussed earlier, EPA is limiting the use of site-specificdata to parameters related to the physical conditions of the site (i.e.,depth to ground water) when calculating case-by-case numerical limits.However, the parameters in the exposure assessment models could be varied.The Agency recognizes that there could be significant differences in thenumerical limits, depending on the type of crop grown. Since crops aregenerally rotated, the Agency did not believe that it was administrativelyfeasible to establish alternative numerical limits for every possible combinationof crops that might be grown on a particular field.The approach that the Agency is proposing may impose numerical limits thatare more stringent than necessary in some cases and less stringent, althoughfully protective, in others. Therefore, the Agency is particularly interestedin public comment on the values used in the exposure assessment modelsfor land application. EPA also solicits comment on whether or not the combinationof assumptions used in the models and the requirements in today's proposaladequately protect public health and the environment without over-regulatingand discouraging the beneficial use of sewage sludge to agricultural lands.As discussed in Part XI of the preamble, the Agency estimates that 266POTWs that apply sewage sludge to agricultural lands are likely to exceedthe numerical limits in Tables 1 and 2.<ITAG tagnum="81">Agricultural Land_Management Practices (andSection; 503.14) 50-MetricTon Limitation</ITAG>The proposed rule limits the application of sewage sludge to agriculturallands to 50 metric tons per hectare (20.24 metric tons per acre) or less,on a dry weight basis. This is equivalent to 250 metric tons of wet sludgeper hectare (approximately 100 metric tons of sludge per acre), assuminga 20 percent solids content. There are two reasons for the 50-metric tonlimitation. First the exposure assessment model cannot calculate pollutantlimits above 50 metric tons per hectare. At 50 metric tons per hectare,the sludge starts to dominate the sludge-soil mass, and the model losesits predictive capability. Second, and equally important, the Agency believesthat land application becomes a disposal, rather than a reuse practice,at rates over 50 dry metric tons per hectare.<ITAG tagnum="81">Crop and Access Limitations</ITAG>Section 503.14(b) requires that owners or operators of agricultural landto which sewage sludge has been applied meet the crop and access restrictionsin andSection; 503.52. These restrictions are to protect crops, animals,and people from pathogenic organisms.EPA is proposing that sewage sludge applied to the land meet one of thethree classes of pathogen reduction which are discussed in connection withSubpart F of the preamble. The class of pathogen reduction selected determinesthe rigor of the access and use restrictions.For the Class A pathogen reduction requirements, treatment works must reduceall pathogenic organisms below levels of detection. These requirementsmust also be met if the treatment processes raise the temperature of thesewage sludge to 53 degrees Celsius and reduce the density of fecal coliformsand fecal streptococci to 100 per gram of volatile suspended solids. Becausethe risk of infection and disease from pathogenic organisms has therebybeen eliminated, no access or use restrictions are placed on sewage sludgethat meets the Class A pathogen requirements.If, however, a treatment work elects to meet the Class B pathogen reductionrequirements, public access to the land and the growth and harvesting ofcrops are restricted to eliminate any remaining potential for pathogenicinfections. Class B pathogen reduction requirements specify the reductionsin the densities of pathogenic bacteria and animal viruses per unit massof volatile suspended solids. Time and natural processes are used to killthe protozoa and helminth ova.Section 503.52(b)(4) prohibits public access to the agricultural land wherethe sewage sludge has been applied for a period of 12 consecutive monthsafter the application of sewage sludge meeting the Class B pathogen reductionrequirements. This does not preclude owners, operators, or employees fromworking in the fields, but it assumes that they will take the necessaryprecautions of washing before handling food and preventing the spread ofany organisms from their clothing. Access restrictions are being imposedbecause the Agency could not assume that the general public would be awareof the need for such precautions. EPA is not specifying the way in whichland owners or operators are to restrict public access, although localauthorities may wish to do so. It is the Agency's belief that fencing orperiodic signs should be sufficient in populated areas.The use restrictions on sewage sludge meeting the Class B pathogen reductionrequirements in andSection; 503.52(b)(2) specify that no food crops withharvested parts above the ground and touching the sludge or the sludge-soilmixture may be grown for a period of 18 consecutive months after the applicationof sewage sludge. The restriction does not apply to crops, such as tomatoes,with harvested parts that do not come into contact with the sludge. Researchindicates that 18 months should be sufficient for the attenuation of thepathogenic organisms.Food crops with harvested parts below the ground, however, may not be grownfor a period of 5 years, unless a demonstration can be made that thereare no viable helminth ova in the soil. If such a demonstration is made,food crops with harvested portions below the ground may be grown 18 monthsafter the application of the sewage sludge. EPA is proposing this restrictionbecause some helminth ova have been shown to survive for as long as 5 years.Even though a demonstration can be made that there are no surviving helminthova, 18 months is needed to allow time for natural processes to inactivateor destroy helminth ova and other pathogenic organisms.Today's rule also proposes that animal feed crops not be harvested fora 30-day period after the application of the sewage sludge. During thistime, wind and rain are likely to reduce the amount of sewage sludge thatadheres to the feed crops.In addition to the restrictions on food and animal feed crops, EPA is proposingthat no animals be allowed to graze on agricultural lands for 30 days afterthe applications of sewage sludge. The 30-day period allows time for theclimatic conditions to integrate the sludge into the soil layer to preventanimals from physically removing the sludge from the fields or ingestingbacteria such as salmonella.If the treatment work chooses to meet the Class C pathogen reduction requirements,more rigorous access, harvesting, and grazing restrictions are imposed.This is necessary because the reductions in the density of pathogenic bacteriaand animal viruses are less stringent than those in the Class A or ClassB requirements. Class C requirements specify that, except for those actuallyapplying the sludge, access is prohibited for 12 months where sewage sludgemeeting the Class C requirements has been applied.The restrictions on growing food crops where sludge meeting Class C requirementsis applied are the same as those for sludge meeting Class B requirements.However, the Agency is proposing to prohibit the harvesting of animal feedcrops and the grazing of animals for 60 days after the application of sewagesludge.<ITAG tagnum="81">Agronomic Rates</ITAG>Section 503.14(c) includes a provision that sewage sludge may not be appliedat rates in excess of the nitrogen requirement of the crop and at ratesthat would cause the excess nitrogen in the sewage sludge to leach to theground water. The objective of this requirement is to optimize the removalof the nitrogen from the sewage sludge for optimal plant growth and tominimize nitrate contamination of ground water.Sewage sludge contains three to five percent nitrogen. Nitrogen may bein the form of nitrogen, organic nitrogen, nitrogen as ammonia, and nitrogennitrate. Organic nitrogen is the predominate form of nitrogen in sewagesludge and decomposes into ammonia and nitrate. Ammonia is the form ofnitrogen absorbed by the plant. Ammonia not absorbed by the plant may volatilizeor has the potential to oxidize and form nitrate, a water-soluble anionthat moves readily downward into the soil profile. High levels of nitratein drinking water supplies may result in health problems for both infantsand livestock. The drinking water standard is 10 micrograms of nitrogenas nitrate per liter of water.The nitrogen requirements of different plants can range from 50 to over350 kilograms per hectare (45-312 pounds per acre). The nitrogen contentof the sewage sludge, cropping patterns, plant-available nitrogen in thesoil, supplemental fertilizers used, climatic conditions, and method ofsewage sludge application also affect the amount of nitrogen that plantscan effectively absorb from the sewage sludge.Rather than establish a national numerical limit for nitrogen, the Agencyis establishing a requirement that the appropriate limit be establishedbased on site-specific land management practices. Guidance is availableto assist in establishing the appropriate application rate from the ``ProcessDesign Manual_Land Application of Municipal Sludge'' (Reference number73) and from County Extension Service agents, State Extension soil fertilityspecialists, and State and local Soil Conservation Service agents.<ITAG tagnum="81">10-Meter Set-Back</ITAG>Section 503.14(e) prohibits the application of sewage sludge to land thatis closer than 10 meters (30 feet) from a surface water source. EPA isproposing 10-meter set-back to reduce the potential for sewage sludge toreach the surface water in case of precipitation. In addition, the numericallimits established with the exposure assessment models are based on a 10-meterset-back from surface waters. Generally, however, States require a 100to 200 foot set-back from surface water. <ITAG tagnum="81">Wellhead Protection Areas</ITAG>Other than the 10-meter set-back from a surface water source, EPA has notproposed locational criteria for the land application of sewage sludge.However, the Agency recommends that, in applying sewage sludge to the land,consideration be given to any Wellhead Protection Areas established pursuantto section 1428 of the Safe Drinking Water Act and any management strategiesestablished by a State under such programs. The Wellhead Protection Programis designed to protect ground water that supplies wells and wellfieldscontributing water to public water supply systems. States may have establishedor may wish to establish other locational criteria consistent with theirown Wellhead Protection Programs. <ITAG tagnum="81">Other Management Practices </ITAG>The Agency has not included provisions that require sewage sludge incorporationinto the soil, soil testing for organic pollutants or metals, or achievementof a particular soil pH. Nor has the Agency included provision to limitthe slope of the fields to which sewage sludge is applied. While theseare sound management practices, EPA believes that its role is to establishstandards which will ensure adequate protection of public health and theenvironment without specifying how individuals are to meet the standards.Frequently, States have specific requirements. Nine States require theincorporation of the sludge into the soil for new crops, 27 States havea soil pH requirement, 18 States require or conditionally require soilanalysis, and 26 States have slope limits. Under the provision of today'sproposal, States may continue to impose such requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">Non-Agricultural Land_Pollutant Limits (andSection; 503.15)</ITAG>Figure IX-B.2 shows how the pollutant limits, pathogen and vector attractionreduction requirements, and management practices which determine whethersewage sludge may be applied to non-agricultural land. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2 299</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>Table 3 of the proposed rule lists the maximum concentration of a pollutantpermitted in sewage sludge applied to non-agricultural lands. As discussedearlier, these concentrations are derived from current sludge quantity(i.e. the 98th-percentile concentrations shown in the ``40 City Study''data base) unless the exposure assessment model calculated a higher concentration.To determine which method would give a higher concentration, the Agencyassumed that sewage sludge would be applied at the rate of 50 metric tonsfor 10 years. Since the model calculated higher pollutant limits for aldrin,chlordane, dieldrin, DDD, DDE, DDT, heptachlor, hexachlorobutadiene, lindane,PCBs, and toxaphene, the values for these pollutants are based on the model.As discussed in Part XI of the preamble, the Agency estimates that 12 POTWsare likely to exceed the numerical limits in Table 3. <ITAG tagnum="81">Non-Agricultural Land_Management Practices (andSection; 503.16) Prohibitionon Food or Feed Crops</ITAG>EPA established the numerical limits for non-agricultural lands on thepremise that pollutants would not reach individuals through the food-chain.Therefore, andSection; 503.16 prohibits growing food or grazing animals onland where sewage sludge meeting the numerical limits in Table 3 is applied.Five years after the final application of the sewage sludge, food and feedcrops may be grown and animals may be grazed on the sludge-amended soils.The Agency recognizes that neither EPA nor owners or lessees can preventinadvertent grazing by wild animals on lands where sewage sludge is applied.However, precautions must be taken to preclude hunting or foraging forfood. Such precautions may include the periodic posting of signs and orfencing. Many non-agricultural lands receive a one-time sewage sludge applicationto assist in the reclamation of the land for more productive purposes.These purposes may eventually include covering the land to agriculturalor residential uses where food-chain crops are grown or farm animals areraised. Therefore, EPA is limiting the prohibition to a period when thesludge is being applied and for 5 years after the final application ofsewage sludge. Five years should provide sufficient time for the solubleportion of the metals to leach from the root zones of any crops grown orto become sorbed to the soil matrix. EPA is interested in comments on difficulties that the Agency may incurin implementing these provisions and the experiences of State and localagencies with similar restrictions. <ITAG tagnum="81">Other Management Practices</ITAG>Vegetative covers are required on non-agricultural lands receiving sewagesludge to retard the migration of the sludge off the land into surfacewater bodies. The access restrictions for Class B and Class C pathogen reduction requirementsare the same for non-agricultural lands as they are for agricultural lands.For Class A sludge applied to non-agricultural lands, the Agency is proposingto restrict access to the land until a vegetative cover has been established.The establishment of a vegetative cover should reduce the risk of trackingthe sewage sludge off the site until natural processes have worked thesludge into the soil profile.In addition to these management practices, andSection; 503.16 contains requirementsprecluding the application of sewage sludge to the land at rates in excessof the nitrogen requirements of the vegetation. Furthermore, sewage sludgeshall not be applied to land that is 10 meters (30 feet) or less from asurface water. The reasons for these requirements are the same as thosediscussed in relationship to agricultural land.The Agency believes that the proposed approach for non-agricultural landswill adequately protect public health and the environment. The exposureassessment model suggests there is some potential for exceeding the environmentaltoxicity values in the case of copper, zinc, and lead. This could occurif sewage sludge containing the concentrations shown in Table 3 was appliedto a hectare of land at the rate of 50 metric tons per hectare on a dryweight basis. In these circumstances, the model indicates that pollutantloadings of copper and zinc would exceed the phytotoxicity values for lettuce,while pollutant loadings of lead would exceed the toxicity value for predatorseating soil biota. However, in conducting the analysis, the Agency usedthe most sensitive species and an extremely high application rate_50 metrictons of sewage sludge per hectare, on a dry weight basis (over 100 metrictons of sewage sludge per acre, assuming 20 percent solids). Therefore,the Agency believes that the actual potential for significant or widespreadadverse environmental effects is very low. EPA has requested data on theappropriate environmental criteria that should be used in evaluating theeffect of applying sewage sludge to non-agricultural lands and is collectingdata on concentrations of pollutants currently in sewage sludge throughthe National Sewage Sludge Survey.Pathogen and Vector Attraction Reduction (andSection; 503.17)Sewage sludge may be applied to agricultural or non-agricultural land ifthe sewage sludge meets any of the pathogen reduction requirements andthe applicable access and crop restrictions are imposed. The three classesof pathogen reduction are discussed in Subpart F of this part of the preamble.EPA is seeking public comment on whether the proposed approach adequatelyprotects the public from direct contact with pathogenic organisms and fromingestion of the organisms when sewage sludge is used in the productionof agricultural commodities. Thirty-five States have adopted the pathogenreduction requirements in 40 CFR Part 257 for application of sewage sludgeto agricultural lands. The Agency is particularly interested in the viewsof these States on the additional flexibility included in today's proposal.In addition to the pathogen reduction requirements, Subpart F of the rulerequires that treatment works process their sludge to rid sewage sludgeof components that attract flies, rodents, mosquitos, and birds_diseasevectors. This is generally done through the reduction of vegetative bacteria.Subpart F describes the five ways in which treatment works may reduce thevector attraction characteristic of sewage sludge.Monitoring, Record Keeping, and Reports andSection;andSection; 503.81 and 503.82)Treatment works that apply sewage sludge to agricultural land are to measurethe concentration of the pollutants on Tables 1 and 2 in andSection; 503.13in accordance with the frequencies established for the design capacityof the treatment work and with the sampling and analysis procedures inandSection; 503.81. In addition, treatment works are to monitor the sewagesludge for compliance with Class A, Class B, or Class C pathogen reductionrequirements. Section 503.82(a)(1) states that unless vector attractionreduction is achieved by injection below the soil surface, the sewage sludgemust be monitored for volatile solids, specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR),pH, and moisture content.The agreements between the treatment works and the distributor or landapplier contain all the records specified in andSection; 503.82(b)(1) thattreatment works must keep and all of the information necessary for treatmentworks to comply with the reporting requirements in andSection; 503.82(c)(1).EPA is proposing that treatment works applying sewage sludge to agriculturallands keep the records for the life of the treatment work to ensure thatthe cumulative pollutant loading rate is not exceeded for a particularparcel of land receiving sewage sludge. The Agency solicits comment onthis proposal and on other appropriate time periods or ways the objectivecould be met without requiring records to be kept for the life of the treatmentwork.The monitoring, record keeping, and reports required in andSection;andSection;503.81 and 503.82 applicable to non-agricultural lands are similar to thoserequired for agricultural lands. One difference is that treatment worksdo not have to keep track of annual and cumulative pollutant loading rates.Therefore, the reports need only be kept for 5 years. Five years is notonly the record retention requirements in the State sludge management programregulation, but it is also the period of time after the final applicationof sewage sludge that crops intended for human consumption may not be grownor animals intended for human consumption may not be raised on the land.As is true for agricultural lands, the agreement between the treatmentwork and the distributor or applier contains all the information necessaryto comply with andSection;andSection; 503.81 and 503.82.<ITAG tagnum="84">Distribution And Marketing (Subpart C)</ITAG>Applicability (andSection;503.20)Approximately 106 facilities distribute and market 705,500 dry metric tonsof sewage sludge (nine percent of the sewage sludge generated). Although22 States have regulations or guidelines applicable to the distributionand marketing of sewage sludge, today's proposal is the first Federal regulationthat establishes specific requirements for sewage sludge that is distributedand marketed.Distribution and marketing of sewage sludge as a means of managing thedisposal of sewage sludge is a highly beneficial practice and one the Agencyencourages. Like land application, distribution and marketing employs thesoil conditioning and fertilizer value of sewage sludge. In a typical distributionand marketing (Dandamp;M) program, sludge products are sold or distributedwithout charge to commercial growers, landscaping firms, parks, highwaydepartments, cemeteries, and golf courses, as well as to the public foruse on lawns, ornamentals, and gardens and as a potting medium. The distributionmay be carried out by the treatment work or by an independent distributor.The distributor may collect the sewage sludge from several treatment worksand process the sewage before bagging or distributing the final productin bulk form. Although the municipality may receive some return from thesale of sludge products, these revenues do not usually cover the costsof treating, distributing, and marketing the sludge product. Decisionson the market area take into account such factors as the cost of shipping,the demand for the product, and the elasticity of the demand. Most facilitiesdistributing and marketing sewage sludge products find that the demandfar exceeds the supply.Sludge quality is the most important factor to consider in the distributionand marketing of sewage sludge. The sludge must have a low concentrationof metals and must meet the Class A pathogen reduction requirements inSubpart F to be distributed and marketed. This may affect some small communitiesthat air-dry their sludge and informally give it away.Communities that do not have adequate procedures to control the qualityof their product may have to improve their quality control procedures oruse an alternative practice. Sludge quality control is crucial in protectinghuman health and the environment and in maintaining public acceptance ofthe Dandamp;M method of managing sewage sludge. The numerical limits, managementpractices, and other requirements in today's proposal are designed to ensurethat only the best quality sludges are distributed and marketed, that adequatequality control procedures are implemented, and that instructions for theappropriate uses and associated quantities of the product are given clearly.These requirements are designed to protect human health and the environmentwhen sewage sludge is distributed and marketed and to fully inform thepublic on the proper use of the product. The Agency is interested in suggestions,particularly from facilities that are already involved in the distributionand marketing of sewage sludge or are considering the practice, on waysto encourage the distribution and marketing of sewage sludge.Subpart C applies to sewage sludge that is distributed and marketed, totreatment works that distribute and market their sewage sluge, to distributorsof sewage sludge or sewage sludge products, and to those applying the sewagesludge or sewage sludge products. Treatment works will need to decide whetherthe requirements for the land application of sewage sludge to either agriculturallands or non-agricultural lands in Subpart B are applicable or whetherthe requirements in this subpart apply.In part, this decision will depend on whether or not a treatment work canenter into an agreement with a sludge user (e.g., municipal agency) thatcan restrict access to areas where the sludge has been applied (as requiredin Subpart B). If this is the case, Subpart B may provide the treatmentwork with more flexibility. If neither an agreement nor access restrictionsare possible, however, the Subpart C requirements must be met.The Agency developed the requirements for the distribution and marketingof sewage sludge on the premise that the sludge would be used in home gardens.Based on that premise, the Agency made the following assumptions: (1) Thetreatment work could not control product use; (2) the Agency could notimpose access or use restrictions; (3) the Agency could require that instructionson the proper use of the product accompany the product; and (4) users wouldcomply with the use instructions. Specialized Definitions (andSection;503.21) A key concept in this subpart is the distinction between sewage sludgeand a sewage sludge product. The sewage sludge product, which is the materialthat is distributed and marketed, may be sewage sludge or a mixture ofsewage sludge and other materials (e.g., woodchips or other bulking agents).The numerical limits in Table 4 of the proposed rule are in the form ofpollutant concentrations that correspond to a specific annual whole sludgeapplication rate. An annual whole sludge application rate is the maximumamount of sewage sludge or sewage sludge product that can be applied toa unit of land in a year without exceeding the pollutant concentrationsin Table 4. The addition of bulking agents to sewage sludge by distributorsmay lower pollutant concentrations in the sewage sludge product, thus allowinga higher application rate for the product than for the unaltered sludge.Pollutant concentrations in sewage sludge may vary from one treatment workto another. Thus, before distributing the product, distributors must determinethe mixture's final pollutant concentrations to calculate the annual productapplication rate for the product's label or accompanying informationalsheet.Distribution and Marketing_General Requirements (andSection;503.22) AgreementsOnly sewage sludge or sewage sludge products that meet the requirementsin Subpart C may be distributed and marketed. To ensure product qualitycontrol, the Agency is requiring treatment works that do not distributethe sewage sludge product to enter into agreements (e.g., a performanceagreement, contract, or other legally binding compliance mechanism) withtheir distributors. As with sludge that is applied to agricultural or non-agriculturalland, sludge that is distributed and marketed must be used in compliancewith the standards established in Part C of the proposed rule, which areindependently enforceable and do not depend on the existence of the contractrelationship between the POTW and any distributor. Rather, the performanceagreement spells out the distributor's obligation under these regulations.The performance agreement is to contain the following: andbullet; Name and address of the distributor;  andbullet; Concentrations of the pollutants listed in Table 4 of 40 CFR 503.23that are in the sewage sludge disbursed to the distributor; andbullet; Appropriate annual whole sludge application rate of the sewagesludge disbursed by the treatment work; andbullet; Appropriate annual product application rate of the product tobe distributed and marketed; andbullet; Documentation that the sewage sludge disbursed to the distributoris in compliance with the Class A pathogen reduction requirements in 40CFR 503.52(a) and that it has been monitored for volatile solids, specificoxygen uptake rate (SOUR), pH, or moisture content in compliance with thevector reduction requirements in 40 CFR 503.53; andandbullet; Facsimile of the label or information sheet containing the informationrequired, in 40 CFR 503.24(c), that is to accompany the product.The Agency is reviewing examples of agreements that treatment works havewith their distributors. Suggestions are particularly welcome on ways tosimplify the performance agreement while still assuring compliance withthe requirements in Subpart C. The requirements for the distribution and marketing of sewage sludge includea provision that recommended application rates not exceed the nitrogenrequirements for the use of the product for the reasons explained in SubpartB. This will require those developing the labels and information sheetsto carefully consider the uses of their product and the areas of the countrywhere the product is to be distributed. Nitrogen requirements differ dependingon the crop and climatic conditions.Distribution And Marketing_National Pollutant Limits (andSection;503.23)<ITAG tagnum="81">Pollutants </ITAG>The Agency is proposing numeric limits for a total of 22 pollutants insewage sludge that is distributed and marketed. Table III-1 lists the pollutantsthat were originally evaluated and Table III-2 lists the pollutants thatdo not interfere with the distribution and marketing of sewage sludge atthe concentrations shown in the ``40 City Study.'' The Agency determinedthat even under worst combination of conditions, cyanide, dimethyl nitrosamine,molybdenum, trichlorethylene, and pentachlorophenol do not interfere withsewage sludge products that are distributed and marketed. As shown in Table12 of andSection;503.72, the Agency would authorize removal credits for thesepollutants. Table III-3 lists the pollutants that were originally evaluated, but forwhich numerical limits are not included in today's proposal due to insufficientdata or because human health criteria have not been established. If sufficientinformation becomes available, these pollutants may be considered in afuture rulemaking proceeding.  Figure IX-C.1 illustrates how the pollutant limits, pathogen and vectorattraction reduction requirements, and management practices determine whetheror not sewage sludge may be distributed and marketed. The requirementsare discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration 2 315</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">National Limits </ITAG>Table 4 of the rule lists the pollutants and the concentrations of thepollutants that may be in sewage sludge that is distributed and marketed.EPA is proposing only national numerical limits because it is not feasibleto take into consideration site-specific parameters when sewage sludgeis distributed and marketed. The pollutant concentrations in Table 4 correspond to an annual whole sludgeapplication rate. Before sludge leaves a treatment work, either for distributionto the public or for transfer to a distributor, the concentrations of thepollutants in Table 4 may not exceed the concentration for the applicableannual whole sludge application rate. Similarly, the distributor must ensurethat the pollutant concentrations in the product distributed and marketeddo not exceed the applicable concentrations for the annual product applicationrate in Table 4. EPA established the pollutant concentrations using the exposure assessmentmodel, which calculated an annual organic pollutant loading rate or a cumulativemetal pollutant loading rate. The Agency developed equations and proceduresto correlate the annual pollutant loading rate to a corresponding annualwhole sludge application rate and a pollutant concentration in sludge.The correlation ensures that the concentration of the pollutants reachingthe plant would not exceed phytotoxicity values when sewage sludge or thesewage sludge product is applied to the land. The correlation also ensuresthat the concentration of the pollutants reaching an individual who ingestsa plant that absorbed the pollutants or who ingests the sludge-soil mixturewould not exceed the human health criteria for the pollutants. The relationshipbetween annual pollutant loading rate, the annual whole sludge applicationrate, and the pollutant concentration are shown below with the same equationsthat were discussed in the application of sewage sludge to agriculturallands: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,26,r10,3</C> <H1>APLR=Candmultiply;0.001andmultiply;AWSAR </H1><H1>  </H1><H1>(1) </H1> <ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L1(0,0,0),b1,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,2,2,16,r20,3</C> <H1>C</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>APLR </H1><H2>0.001andmultiply;AWSAR </H2><H1>  </H1><H1>(2) </H1> <ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="20">Where: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">APLR=Annual pollutant loading rate, in kilograms per hectare. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C=Pollutant concentration in sewage sludge, in milligrams per kilogram(dry weight basis). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">AWSAR=Annual whole sludge application rate, in metric tons per hectare,per year (dry weight basis). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">0.001=Converts milligrams per kilogram times metric tons per hectareto kilograms per hectare. </ITAG>A treatment work or a distributor would determine the pollutant concentrationin the sewage sludge or sewage sludge product for the pollutants listedin Table 4 of the rule. When the actual pollutant concentration is betweenthe values of the Table, the lower annual whole sludge application rateapplies. The appropriate whole sludge application rate is determined bythe lowest annual whole sludge application rate after calculating applicationrates for all of the pollutants. The pollutant limits that the treatmentwork must meet prior to distribution are those for the appropriate annualwhole sludge application rate. The annual product application rate is determinedin the same way. If the distributor does not add bulking agents to reducepollutant concentrations in the sludge, the annual product applicationrate is the same as the annual whole sludge application rate. If bulkingagents are added or the distributor mixes sludges of different qualities,the annual product application rate would be based on the actual pollutantconcentrations in the mixture. Appendix B describes the procedure in detailand provides an example. The annual whole sludge application rates for PCBs are limited to concentrationsof 49 ppm. For reasons described elsewhere in this preamble, sewage sludgewith PCB concentrations of 50 ppm or greater are regulated under TSCA andthe implementing regulations in 40 CFR Part 761. <ITAG tagnum="81">Sludge-Soil Mixture </ITAG>In establishing the pollutant limits in Table 4, the Agency made certaincritical assumptions. The first assumption is that the sewage sludge ismixed with the soil to a depth of 6 inches. The ratio of sewage sludgeto soil becomes 1 to 200, if applied at a rate of 10 metric tons per hectare.The Agency recognizes that homeowners fertilizing their lawns are unlikelyto incorporate the sludge product into the soil unless establishing newlawns. Nevertheless, homeowners may water the lawn after applying the sludgeproduct causing the pollutants to migrate into the soil profile in a shortperiod of time. The Agency has no data on the sludge-to-soil ratio whensludge migrates into the soil profile through watering or natural processesand is requesting data and views on the premise that either the homeowneror natural processes will ensure that sludge and soil are mixed to a depthof 6 inches. The assumption that the sludge mixes with soil to a depth of 6 inches iscritical in evaluating the effect of sewage sludge on children who inadvertentlyingest soil. Because the Agency assumes that children ingest a sludge-soilmixture (i.e., a diluted form of sludge), direct ingestion of sludge isno longer the pathway that determines the pollutant concentration for leadin distributed and marketed sludge. If the Agency had assumed that childreningested pure sludge, the model would have calculated a more stringentpollutant concentration for lead. However, since the label and informationalsheets accompanying the product are to warn that children should not beallowed to ingest the product, the Agency believes that children will beadequately protected.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Pathways Of Exposure Eliminated For Dandamp;M Scenario </ITAG>Another key assumption in the Dandamp;M scenario is that animals would notbe raised for human consumption. In addition, the Agency assumed that homeownerswould not apply a sewage sludge product in quantities sufficient to affectthe ground water adversely. By eliminating the animal and ground-waterexposure pathways, some pollutant concentrations in Table 4 become lessstringent than those in the agricultural land application tables. Chlordaneand toxaphene concentrations are less stringent in Dandamp;M than in agriculturalland application because the ground-water pathway was eliminated. The limitsfor DDD/DDE/DDT, heptachlor, hexachlorobutadiene, lindane, PCBs, toxaphene,mercury, and selenium also are less stringent in Dandamp;M because the animalpathways of exposure were eliminated. Selenium is toxic to animals whenthey eat plants that have absorbed large quantities of the pollutant. Theremaining pollutants bioaccumulate through the food-chain and, therefore,limit the pollutant concentration when sewage sludge is applied to agriculturallands. The Agency is proposing to prohibit grazing or feeding animals intendedfor human consumption on pastures or crops to which sewage sludge thatmeets the Dandamp;M pollutant limits has been applied. As an alternative,the Agency could include the animal pathways of exposure, if there is sufficientindication that the Dandamp;M scenario should include raising animals forhuman consumption.The Agency is interested in the views of commenters on the assumptionsit used in defining the Dandamp;M scenario. Also the Agency would like toknow if the apparent anomaly of less restrictive pollutant limits for theDandamp;M practice, which is otherwise more tightly controlled than agriculturalland application, will create problems for those involved in the distributionand marketing of sewage sludge.<ITAG tagnum="81">Number of Applications </ITAG>In establishing the numerical limits for the nine metals in Table 4, theAgency had to make assumptions on the number of years that sewage sludgewould be applied to the land. The Agency selected 20 applications as areasonable basis for its calculations. Because the total amount of metalsapplied to the soil is the critical parameter, it is not important whetherthe applications are consecutive or whether the applications occur biannually,etc. It is the total amount of metal that is applied to the land that iscritical. If the Agency had limited the number of applications to lessthan 20, the concentration of the metal in the sludge could increase. Conversely,if the Agency had assumed that the number of applications would be greaterthan 20, the pollutant concentrations would have to decrease. The Agency examined an alternative of requiring the distributor to specifythe number of years on the product label and to use the specified numberof years in calculating the limits for metals. This approach was rejectedbecause a homeowner is unlikely to know whether a previous owner had useda sewage sluge product and, if so, how many applications were made. Inaddition, the proposed approach is simpler to implement. The Agency issoliciting comment on whether 20 years is an appropriate time period touse in establishing the numerical limits for metals. The pollutants in Table 4 are among the pollutants that are eligible forremoval credits when sewage sludge is distributed and marketed. POTWs whosesludge meets the pollutant limits in Table 4 may issue removal creditsto their industrial users if the POTW is eligible to do so under the provisionsin 40 CFR Part 403.As discussed in Part XI, the Agency estimates that 35 of 106 facilitieswill fail to meet the pollutant limits in Table 4.Distribution and Marketing_Management Practices (andSection; 503.24)<ITAG tagnum="81">Labels and Information Sheets </ITAG>EPA is proposing that sewage sludge products be labeled or accompaniedby information on the proper use of the product. When there is a reasonableexpectation that individuals will comply with label instructions, the Agencyprefers to rely on the use of labels, rather than on licensing or prohibitingthe application of a product. EPA has every reason to believe that theinstructions included in andSection; 503.24 will be followed.If the sewage sludge is distributed in bulk form, an information sheetis to be given to the individual who receives the product. If the sewagesludge is distributed in bags or other containers, a label is to be affixedto the bag or container. In general, the label or information sheet isto contain information on the product's distributor, product contents,appropriate product uses, amount to be used, prohibited uses, and warnings.This type of information is on the labels of many sewage sludge products.Fourteen of the 22 States regulating the distribution and marketing ofsewage sludge require product labels. Specifically, the labels and informationalsheets are to include the following information:andbullet; Name and address of the distributor of the product;andbullet; Statement that the product is derived from sewage sludge;andbullet; List of the pollutant concentrations in the product (at a minimum,the list of pollutants is to include the pollutants in Table 4 of 40 CFR503.23, if they are present, and the nitrogen concentration of the product);andbullet; Statement prohibiting the use of the product on frozen, snow-covered,or flooded land;andbullet; Statement prohibiting use, except in accordance with the instructions;andbullet; Instructions on the appropriate uses of the product;andbullet; Rate at which the product may be applied for the stipulated uses;andbullet; Warning to keep product out of reach of children;andbullet; Statement prohibiting the grazing of animals raised for humanconsumption on land where the product is applied; andbullet; Statement prohibiting the use of crops as feed for animals raisedfor human consumption; and andbullet; Statement that compliance with the instructions on the label orinformation sheet will constitute compliance with section 405(e) of theCWA.Provided the label instructions are followed, EPA believes that the pollutantconcentrations in Table 4 adequately protect human health and the environment.Except for the pathways involving the raising of animals for human consumption,the drinking of ground water from wells that might become contaminated,and the inhalation of volatile organic compounds, EPA has examined allpossible pathways through which a pollutant might reach an individual,a plant, or an animal. The numerical limits in Table 4 reflect the pathwaythat establishes the most stringent pollutant concentration. A statement prohibiting the application of the product on frozen, snow-covered,or flooded land is specified to preclude product run-off into a nearbyriver, stream, or lake. Unlike the requirement in Subpart B, this is anabsolute prohibition. It would be impossible for all who use the productto demonstrate that if the sewage sludge is applied to frozen snow-covered,or flood land, that the sewage sludge would not reach a river, stream,or lake.Statements prohibiting animals raised for human consumption from grazingon pastures or feeding on crops grown on soil to which sludge has beenapplied are included because of the tendency of some of the pollutantsto bioaccumulate in the food-chain. As mentioned above, the Agency is requestingcomment the need to assume that animals will be raised for human consumptionin the Dandamp;M scenario and to revise the numeric limits accordingly.EPA is proposing that the labels include warnings to keep the product outof the reach of children. Over a period of time, eating significant amountsof undiluted sewage sludge out of the bag could adversely affect youngchildren. As described elsewhere in the preamble, the Agency modeled inadvertentsludge-soil mixture ingestion in young children (ages 1 through 5). TheAgency did not model the ingestion of pure sludge of young children becauseeither the applier or natural processes are expected to mix the sludgeproduct with the soil. Therefore, the Agency believes that the warningon the label should provide adequate protection for young children.The Agency is requiring that the labels or information sheets state theproper amount of the sewage sludge to use because of (1) the requirementthat sewage sludge not be applied in excess of the nitrogen requirementsof the vegetation and (2) the correlation between the pollutant concentrationsand the annual whole sludge or product application rate described above.The instructions should be in terms that an average individual would understand.For example, if the product is authorized to be applied at an annual productapplication rate of 15 metric tons per hectare, the phrase, ``307 poundsper thousand square feet per year'', stated on the label on the informationsheet, would be more understandable and more likely to be followed.Products with higher pollutant concentrations must be applied at lowerannual application rates. Questions have been raised whether a homeownerwould follow a label if the rate is limited to one metric ton per hectare(i.e., 20.5 pounds per 1000 square feet) or even 5 metric tons per hectare(i.e., 102.4 pounds per 1000 square feet). Some believe that a homeownermight not apply the product at very low rates on the assumption that thesewage sludge would not provide sufficient nutrient and soil conditioningproperties at such low rates. If the product were applied at higher rates,the application rate would exceed the authorized pollutant concentrationsin Table 4. The Agency is seeking comment on whether instructions for lowerapplication rates are likely to be followed and whether the pollutant concentrationsshould start at a higher annual whole sludge or product application rate,such as 10 metric tons per hectare (i.e., 205 pounds per 1000 square feet).Pathogen and Vector Attraction Reduction (andSection; 503.25)Sewage sludge that is distributed and marketed is likely to be handledby the general public without protective clothing or applied where publicaccess cannot be restricted. In addition, fruits and vegetables are likelyto be planted immediately after the product is applied to the soil. Therefore,all sewage sludge that is distributed and marketed must meet the ClassA pathogen reduction requirement in andSection; 503.52(a). As previouslyexplained, Class A pathogen reduction requires that pathogenic bacteria,animal viruses, protozoa, and helminth ova be reduced below levels of detection.Class A requirements may also be met if the treatment processes raise thetemperature of the sewage sludge to 53 degrees Celsius and reduce the fecalcoliform and fecal streptococci in the treated sewage sludge to less than100 per gram of volatile suspended solids. The vector attraction reductionrequirements are outlined in andSection; 503.53.EPA is proposing that the treatment works treat the sludge to meet therequirements for Class A pathogen reduction and vector attraction reductionbefore distributing the sewage sludge to the public or to a distributor.The processes needed to comply with these requirements are part of thetreatment works' processes and are the responsibility of the treatmentworks.Monitoring, Record Keeping, and Reports 503.81 and 503.83)Section 503.83 requires that prior to distributing or marketing their sewagesludge, treatment works determine from a representative sample of the sewagesludge the pollutant concentrations and nitrogen content in order to calculatethe annual whole sludge application rate. Depending on the frequency withwhich treatment works distribute a stock pile of sewage sludge to the publicor to distributors, the monitoring may take place at more frequent intervalsthan those in andSection; 503.81(c). Therefore, treatment works may haveto hold the sludge until the representative sample can be analyzed. Ifthe distribution of sewage sludge takes place at less frequent intervalsthan specified in andSection; 503.81(c), treatment works must monitor theirsewage sludge at the intervals specified in andSection; 503.81(c). Treatmentworks also must monitor the sewage sludge to determine compliance withClass A pathogen reduction and vector attraction reduction requirementsprior to distribution. If the treatment work is not the distributor, the distributor must monitorthe product for the pollutants in Table 4. The distributor must then calculatethe annual product application rate on the basis of the pollutant concentrationsin the product and place the annual product application rate on the labelor information sheet.The performance agreement with the distributor contains the informationidentical to that which treatment works must keep to meet the record keepingrequirements in andSection; 503.83(b) and the reports required under andSection;503.83(c). If the treatment work distributes and markets the sewage sludge,the treatment work is likely to keep these records and will be requiredto do so under the provisions in andSection;andSection; 503.83(b) and 503.83(c).The Agency is proposing retention of records for 5 years, the record retentionrequirement included in the State program management regulation (40 CFRPart 501). The Agency also considered 3 years. Comment is solicited onthe period of time that the Agency should require that treatment worksretain records if their sewage sludge is distributed and marketed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Monofills (Subpart D)</ITAG>Applicability (andSection; 503.40)The requirements contained in this proposal apply to landfills receivingonly sewage sludge (monofills) and to any person who disposes of sewagesludge in a monofill. A monofill is an area of land (i.e., a landfill)that contains one or more units accepting only sewage sludge. These unitsare covered by suitable material at the end of each operating day or atmore frequent intervals. EPA has identified 49 monofills (see RegulatoryImpact Analysis) and estimates that just over 100,000 dry metric tons outof the approximately 8 million dry metric tons of the total sewage sludgegenerated, is disposed of in monofills. A much larger percentage of the sewage sludge generated (i.e., 41 percentor 3.2 million dry metric tons) is disposed of with municipal solid wastein 6,700 MSWLFs. Sewage sludge typically represents five percent of thetotal waste in these landfills. Under the joint authority of Sections 4004 and 4010 of RCRA and section405(d) of the CWA, the Agency proposed requirements for MSWLFs that applyto sewage sludge that is placed in these landfills (see 53 FR 33314, August30, 1988). The Agency adopted this approach for the reasons discussed inSubpart A of this part of the preamble. Treatment works using a MSWLF todispose of their sewage sludge must ensure that their sewage is non-hazardousand passes the Paint Filter Liquid Test. They must also send their sewagesludge to State-permitted facilities. If these requirements are met, treatmentworks will be in compliance with section 405(e) of the CWA. Specialized Definitions (andSection; 503.31)<ITAG tagnum="81">Class I, Class II, And Class III Ground Water </ITAG>In August 1984, EPA issued its Ground-Water Protection Strategy (Referencenumber 38) to set out a policy framework for enhancing ground-water protectionefforts by EPA and the States. In December 1986, the Agency released draft``Guidelines for Ground-Water Classification Under the EPA Ground-WaterProtection Strategy'' (Reference number 53). The classification guidelinesprovide the procedures for implementing the Strategy and can be used indifferentiating classes of ground water based on use, value to society,and vulnerability of the ground water to contamination. In developing thedefinitions of Class I, Class II, and Class III ground water in today'sproposal, the Agency used the guidelines as the basis of the definitions.Class I ground water is defined as an existing source of drinking wateror unusually high value that is vulnerable to contamination and is eitherirreplaceable as a source of drinking water for substantial numbers ofpeople or is ecologically vital (i.e., habitat for rare or endangered species).Class II ground water includes all non-Class I ground water that is currentlyused for, or is potentially available for, drinking water. Class III groundwater is not a source of drinking water because the ground water has oneor more of the following characteristics: (1) The concentration of totaldissolved solids (TDS) is greater than or equal to 10,000 milligrams perliter (mg/1); (2) the concentration of pollutant(s) exceeds the drinkingwater standard(s) and cannot be cleaned-up using treatment methods reasonablyemployed in public water systems; and (3) the yields are insufficient tomeet the needs of an average household (150 gallons per day). As explained later in this subpart of the preamble, the pollutant limitsand the way in which the pollutant limits are calculated depend on theclass of ground water under the monofill. Therefore, in accordance withthe definitions in andSection; 503.31 (b), (c), and (d), owners or operatorsmust document the class of ground water underlying the monofill. In the Spring of 1988, the Agency conducted a probability analysis of theclasses of ground water under the 49 current active monofills. For eachmonofill site, the analysis estimated the probability that a monofill wouldbe located over a Class I, Class II, and Class III ground water (Referencenumber 54). All ground water underlying the monofills was estimated to have an 82 percentprobability of being designated as Class II. Fourteen monofills had a 16to 18 percent probability of lying over ground water designated as ClassI. Only two monofills had any probability of lying over ground water designatedas Class III. These monofills would be over ground water that is not currentlybeing used as a source of drinking water. The probability analysis wasconducted as part of the Agency's effort to assess the impact of the ruleon existing facilities. It was not intended to replace State and localsite-specific classifications of the ground water underlying each sludgemonofill. <ITAG tagnum="81">Lateral Expansion</ITAG>The Agency has defined lateral expansion to mean a horizontal expansionof a sewage sludge unit boundary (see Figure IX-D.1). A sewage sludge unitis an area of land within a monofill in which only sewage sludge is placedand where the sewage sludge is covered with suitable material. Under today'sproposal, lateral expansions are treated as new units and must meet therequirements applicable to new units. Any area of an existing unit thathas not received waste by the effective date of this rule, but later receiveswaste is a lateral expansion. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 334</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG>General Requirements For Monofills (andSection; 503.32)Section 503.32(a) prohibits the disposal of sewage sludge in a monofillunless the requirements of the subpart are met. In addition to the otherrequirements, owners or operators of monofills must obtain an NPDES permitfor any discharge from the monofill (i.e., the collection and dischargeof run-off from the monofill).<ITAG tagnum="81">Requirements For Ground-Water Classification</ITAG>EPA is proposing in andSection; 503.32(c) that owners and operators documentthe class of ground water underlying the monofill, in accordance with thedefinitions of ground water discussed above. The documentation should beconfirmed by the appropriate State authority as accurately representingone of the classes of ground water in andSection; 503.31 (b), (c), or (d)and as consistent with the way that the State has classified or would classifythe ground water.``The Guidelines for Ground-Water Classification Under the EPA Ground-WaterProtection Strategy'' (Reference number 53), is an important resource toconsult in determining the class of ground water under a monofill. Priorto initiating efforts to classify the ground water under a particular monofill,EPA recommends that owners and operators consult with the appropriate Stateagencies.<ITAG tagnum="81">Threatened Or Endangered Species</ITAG>Monofills should not be located where they would cause or contribute tothe harm of a threatened or endangerd species of plant, fish, or wildlife.Care also should be taken to ensure that monofills do not result in thedestruction or adverse modification of the critical habitat of such a species.This provision is carried forward from 40 CFR 257.3-2 to ensure that thedisposal of sewage sludge is conducted in an environmentally responsiblemanner.<ITAG tagnum="81">Requirements For Monofills In Floodplains</ITAG>In andSection; 503.32(e), EPA is proposing that new and existing monofillslocated in a 100-year floodplain shall not restrict the flow of the baseflood, reduce the temporary water storage capacity of the floodplain, orresult in a washout of solid waste that would pose a hazard to human healthand the environment. Today's proposal would allow new and existing monofillsto be located in a 100-year floodplain only if the monofills can be designedand operated to protect human health, wildlife, or land or water resources.This requirement may be necessary to ensure adequate protection of humanhealth and the environment from sewage sludge placed in monofills. Floodscan damage or undermine the structural integrity of monofills causing releaseand dispersion of pollutants. Pollutant limitations were derived basedupon an assumption of structural integrity of the monofill. Additionally,the model developed to derive limitations accounts for normal rainfallbut does not account for the transport of pollutants resulting from theimmersion of the monofill by a flood.Disposal of sewage sludge in floodplains may have significant adverse impacts.If the monofill is not adequately protected from washout, wastes may becarried by flood waters from the site, causing water quality criteria tobe exceeded downstream. Filling in the floodplain may restrict the flowof flood waters, causing greater flooding upstream, or may cause more rapidmovement of flood waters downstream, resulting in higher flood levels,greater flood damage, and greater risk to human health and the environment.Owners and operators should use flood insurance rate maps (FIRMS) developedby the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to determine whethera unit is located in the 100-year floodplain. FEMA has developed maps forapproximately 99 percent of the flood-prone communities in the United States.These maps can be obtained at no cost from the FEMA Flood Map DistributionCenter, 6930 (A-F), San Tomas Road, Baltimore, Maryland, 21227-6227. Inareas of the country where FIRMs are not available, other sources of informationinclude the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Soil Conservation Service,the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. GeologicSurvey, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, the TennesseeValley Authority, and State and local flood control agencies.If the monofill is expected to, or does, restrict the flow of the 100-yearflood and the water storage capacity of the floodplain, the monofill maynot be located in the floodplain and must close within one year of thedate this rule is promulgated, in accordance with andSection; 503.32(l).These location and closure requirements should safeguard the 100-year floodflow and water storage capacity of the floodplain from problems relatedto the location of a monofill. Other Agency regulations allow activitiesand facilities in 100-year floodplains if precautions have been taken toprevent washout (see 40 CFR Part 257, 40 CFR Part 264, and proposed 40CFR Part 258). The Agency is soliciting comment on its proposal to prohibitmonofills in the 100-year floodplain if the monofill does, or is likelyto, restrict the flow of a 100-year flood.<ITAG tagnum="81">Requirements for Monofills Near Airports </ITAG>In today's proposal, andSection; 503.32(f) specifies appropriate distancesbetween monofills and airports. Monofills located within 10,000 feet ofairports handling turbine-powered aircraft and within 5,000 feet for airportshandling aircraft powered by piston engines must not attract birds thatcould pose a hazard to aircraft. The proposed requirement is included becausemonofills may receive putrescible wastes which attract birds despite requirementsfor daily cover. The birds may present a significant risk of collisionswith aircraft. The distances specified are designed to meet the requirementsof the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order 5200.5, ``FAA GuidanceConcerning Sanitary Landfills on or near Airports'' (October 6, 1974).This states that solid waste disposal facilities ``may be incompatiblewith safe flight operations'' when located near an airport. The distancesderived from FAA Order 5200.5 are based on the fact that more than 62 percentof all bird strikes occur below altitudes of 500 feet (150 meters) andthat aircraft generally are below this altitude within the distances specified.EPA recommends that owners and operators of monofills consult with theU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the appropriate State agency to determinewhether specific facilities pose a hazard to aircraft from birds. Whereappropriate, this determination should be made in consultation with theFAA, as well as with the owners and operators of near-by airports. Wastedisposal within the specified distances may continue if the owner or operatorcan demonstrate that the operation does not increase the risk of bird andplane collisions. <ITAG tagnum="81">Requirements for Monofills in Seismic Zones </ITAG>Section 503.32(g) of today's proposal would require that sewage sludgeunits in a monofill located within a seismic zone be designed and builtto resist the maximum ground motion. Seismic zones are defined as areashaving a ground motion greater than or equal to 0.10 gravities. Maps depicting the potential seismic activity across the United Statesat a constant probability have been prepared (U.S. Geological Survey Open-FileReports 82-1033). The maps show that certain portions of the country havehigher levels of seismic hazard than other areas. For example, portionsof the eastern United States have higher levels of seismic hazard thanportions of the western United States. EPA is proposing that sewage sludge units of monofills located in seismiczones be built to withstand the maximum ground motion because ground motioncould cause cracks in foundations or the collapse of structures. Studiesindicate that ground motion resulting from earthquakes without associatedsurface faulting has been found in some cases to be two or three timesthat associated with quakes with faulting (Reference number 74). The appropriatepeak ground acceleration on which to base the design of the sewage sludgeunit may be determined from regional studies and site-specific analyses.Designs appropriate for the peak ground acceleration should be approvedby EPA. Requiring sewage sludge units of monofills to be built to withstand themaximum ground motion is consistent with other Agency rules. However, theAgency is soliciting comment on whether to prohibit the location of monofillsin seismic zones. <ITAG tagnum="81">Requirements for Landfills Near Holocene Faults </ITAG>In andSection; 503.32(h), EPA is proposing to prohibit the siting of sewagesludge units of monofills in locations within 60 meters (200 feet) of faultsthat have had displacement in Holocene time. The Holocene is a geologictime unit, known as an epoch, that extends from the end of the Pleistoceneto the present (approximately the last 11,000 years.)Earthquakes present a threat to public safety and welfare in many areasof the United States. Damage and loss of life in earthquakes occur fromsurface displacement along faults (surface faulting) and ground motion(shaking), as well as secondary effects of the shaking, such as groundor soil failure. Today's proposal is designed to protect facilities fromdeformation (i.e., bending and warping) and displacement (i.e., the relativemovement of any two sides of a fault measured in any direction) of theearth's surface that occurs when the fault moves. If a facility is locatednear a fault, containment structures (i.e., liners, leachate collectionsystems, and final covers) may be inadequate to prevent release of sewagesludge during an earthquake. The Agency is proposing that monofills nowlocated within 60 meters (200 feet) of a Holocene fault close, in accordancewith andSection; 503.32(l), within 1 year of promulgation of this rule. Holocene faults are designated in this proposal because geologic evidenceindicates that faults that have moved in recent times (i.e., during thelast 11,000 years) are the ones most likely to move in the future. Faultsthat have moved in Holocene time are easier to identify and date in thefield than older faults because this epoch produced recognizable geologicaldeposits. The U.S. Geological Survey mapped the location of Holocene faultsin the United States in 1978 (Reference number 74). Maps of identifiedHolocene faults in the United States also are available from the Statesof California and Nevada. EPA is prohibiting sewage sludge units of monofills within 60 meters ofa Holocene fault because studies suggest that most deformation takes placewithin this distance. The effects of deformation drop off rapidly as distancefrom the fault increases. The farther away the monofill is from the mainfault, the less likely it will be to be affected by deformation. EPA'sdefinition of ``fault'' (see andSection; 503.31(i)) includes main, branch,or secondary faults. This definition includes faults that appear at thesurface and those that do not have surface expression (including the smallfault planes associated with surface faults). The 60-meter setback wouldbe measured from any surface or subsurface fault, thus giving ample protectionagainst the effects of deformation. Today's proposal differs from the proposed requirements of 40 CFR 258.13in that closure of existing MSWLFs is not required for those landfillslocated in fault areas, although new units are prohibited from being sitedin these areas. EPA does not have sufficient information to justify allowingexisting sewage sludge units to remain open while prohibiting the sitingof new monofills or sewage sludge units in these areas. <ITAG tagnum="81">Requirement For The Location Of Monofills In Stable Areas </ITAG>EPA is proposing that monofills be located in areas having adequate supportfor the structural components of the sewage sludge units (andSection;503.32(i)).Locating monofills in unstable areas is inappropriate because, if the soilsubsides, damage to the monofill may cause extensive environmental damageand, potentially, adverse human health effects. To determine if an area is unstable, the following factors should be considered:(1) Soil conditions that cause significant differential settling; (2) geologicor geomorphologic features such as areas prone to mass movement, Karstterrains, or fissures; (3) surface areas weakened by withdrawal of oil,gas, or water; and (4) other features that historically have indicatedthat protective measures cannot be designed to withstand a natural eventsuch as a volcanic eruption. A detailed description of unstable areas iscontained in the ``Technical Support Document: Landfilling of Sewage Sludge''(Reference number 58). EPA has not tried to delineate all potential unstable areas. Rather, EPAbelieves that owners or operators, in conjunction with the permitting authorityand on a case-by-case basis, will make determinations on the stabilityof an area and on the appropriateness of an area for a monofill. The Agencyhas proposed a similar requirement for MSWLFs and is considering such arequirement in its revisions to the hazardous waste landfill regulation.Section 503.32(l) requires closure of sewage sludge units of monofillsthat are located in unstable areas within 1 year. This differs from theproposed requirements for MSWLFs (40 CFR 258.15) in that closure of existingMSWLFs in unstable areas is required within 5 years of the effective dateof rule. This period, however, may be extended by the State after consideringthe availability of alternative disposal capacity and the potential riskto human health and the environment. Such a consideration is allowed underthe ``practicable capability'' language of RCRA, while the CWA has no suchprovision. In addition, the CWA requires compliance within 1 year of theeffective date of the regulations. For these reasons, the requirementsin today's rule differ from those in 40 CFR 258.15. <ITAG tagnum="81">Prohibition of Monofills In Wetlands </ITAG>Section 503.32(j) includes a provision to prohibit the location of sewagesludge units of monofills within the perimeter of wetland areas. Wetlandareas are defined as those ``areas that are inundated or saturated by surfaceor ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, andthat under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetationtypically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands include,but are not limited to, swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas'' (see40 CFR Part 230). Wetland maps are available from the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService. Constructing sewage sludge units, essentially a fill operation, has thepotential for causing significant environmental damage in a wetland. Suchdamage cannot be restored because of the complexities and fragility ofthe wetland ecosystem. In 40 CFR Part 258, new facilities are allowed inwetlands provided very strict demonstrations are made. The Congressionaldirective in Section 4010 of RCRA, as amended, allows EPA to consider the``practicable capability'' of owners and operators of facilities that mayreceive household hazardous waste or small quantity generator waste indetermining the standards to be set. The CWA has no such statutory authorityfor the sewage sludge reuse and disposal standards.The Agency has identified wetlands protection as a top priority and, sincethe proposal of the Part 258 requirements, has under consideration theprohibition of all landfill operations in wetlands. The Agency believesmore appropriate locations may be found for the siting of monofills. Section503.32(l) requires sewage sludge units of monofills located in wetlandsto close within 1 year. We invite comment on the appropriateness of thisprohibition.<ITAG tagnum="81">Requirement For Water Collection And Discharge</ITAG>Section 503.32(k) requires the collection and discharge of the volume ofwater from the 24-hour, 25-year storm event, in accordance with an applicableNPDES permit. The Agency is proposing this requirement to ensure that thepollutants in the runoff from sewage sludge units in a monofill are collectedand, if appropriate, treated in accordance with an NPDES permit. Controlof surface runoff may be accomplished by (1) minimizing water that entersthe active sewage sludge units of the facility (run-on controls), (2) minimizingthe size and number of active sewage sludge units in a monofill, (3) preventingthe disposal of sludge with low solids content, and (4) collecting andmanaging the runoff. Today's proposal only requires the collection andmanagement of the runoff.The Agency chose the 25-year storm as the design parameter to be consistentwith the requirements for hazardous waste landfills in 40 CFR 264.301(g)and the proposed requirement in 40 CFR 258.26(a)(2). Both of these provisionsrequire the active portions of the landfill to be protected from the peakdischarge of a 25-year storm. Twenty-seven States require runoff controlsfor their landfills.EPA is requesting information on problems that communities may have encounteredwith locating monofills in areas subject to more frequent flooding (e.g.,in 5- or 10-year floodplains) and whether the Agency should consider prohibitngor restricting the location of monofills in areas of frequent flooding.The Agency also considered requiring run-on controls to prevent flow ontothe active portion of the landfill during the peak discharge from a baseflood, as is required in 40 CFR 258.26(a)(1). Such controls minimize boththe generation of leachate and the volume of runoff which must be collected.Rainfall and the generation of leachate is considered in the exposure assessmentmodel for calculating the pollutant concentrations for disposing of sludgein monofills. Since leachate generation is already taken into the pollutantlimits, a requirement for run-on controls is unnecessary. While run-oncontrols do minimize runoff, the decision on how to meet the standard isleft to the owner or operator of each treatment work. EPA, therefore, rejectedthis requirement as redundant. Comments are requested on the advisabilityof requiring run-on controls in addition to controls of surface water runoff.<ITAG tagnum="81">Closure Requirements</ITAG>Section 503.32(l) requires that existing sewage sludge units located within60 meters of a fault or stress fractures that have had displacement inHolocene time, located in unstable areas, or located in wetland areas closewithin 1 year of the effective date of this rule. This requirement is necessarybecause section 405(d)(2)(D) of the CWA requires compliance with theserules within 1 year of their promulgation.<ITAG tagnum="81">Closure Plan</ITAG>Section 503.32(m) of today's proposal requires that owners or operatorprepare a written closure plan for each sewage sludge unit that will needto be closed. The closure plan is necessary to ensure that owners or operatorshave considered and planned for the necessary activities (e.g., the typeof final cover, the cover maintenance, gas venting, and public access controls)to close the sewage sludge unit in a manner that will continue to protecthuman health and environment. The final cover must be designed to minimizevolatilization of pollutants, settling, subsidence, erosion, or other eventsand prevent runoff from, or other damage to, the final cover. Althoughthe Agency believes the numerical limits and management practices requiredin today's proposal are adequate to protect human health and the environment,the requirement for a closure plan ensures continued human health and environmentalprotection, particularly for monofills receiving sewage sludge before thepromulgation of today's requirements.Today's proposal for a closure plan requires that the final cover, gasventing, and public access controls be maintained for 10 years. This requirementis based in part on a recent study entitled ``Pilot Scale Evaluation ofSludge Landfilling_Four Years of Operation'' (Reference number 76). Inthat study, sewage sludge, sewage sludge mixed with municipal solid waste(MSW) and MSW itself were placed in simulated landfill cells and methaneproduction was monitored for 3 years and seven months. The results indicatethat gas production levels off by the end of the third year. However, becausethis experiment was a laboratory simulation and was not performed on anoperating landfill, there is uncertainty as to the time required for methanegas production to practically cease in an operating landfill. To accountfor this uncertainty and to allow a safety factor, a 10-year period ofmethane monitoring was selected for the proposal. States may extend theperiod of time for post-closure care if it is deemed appropriate. The Agencyis soliciting public comment on the 10-year time period and would be particularlyinterested in hearing from those States and municipalities with monofills.<ITAG tagnum="81">Financial Assurance Requirements</ITAG>Financial assurance requirements were considered, but rejected, for thisrule. Financial assurance is primarily aimed at fulfilling the closureresponsibilities under the closure plan and for corrective action in theevent of contamination of ground water.Today's rule is based on sewage sludge meeting the concentration limitsfor pollutants in the sludge and on monitoring the sewage sludge to complywith this requirement. Complying with the concentration limits will protectground water from contamination during the period of active use and theperiod covered by the closure plan. Further, the costs of closure underthe closure plan required at andSection; 503.32(m) are expected to be minimal.For these reasons, the Agency did not believe the limited possibility thatthe pollutants would leach to the ground water in concentrations in excessof the drinking water standards warranted the imposition of an extensiveburden of financial responsibility on owner or operators. EPA invites commenton the advisability of adding financial assurance requirements to the monofillingportion of today's rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">Wellhead Protection Areas</ITAG>In addition to the location requirements discussed above, EPA recommendsthat owners and operators consider the location of any Wellhead ProtectionAreas established pursuant to section 1428 of the Safe Drinking Water Actand any management strategies established by a State under such programs.The Wellhead Protection Program is designed to protect ground water thatsupplies wells and wellfields that contribute drinking water to publicwater supply systems.The Agency solicits comments whether State or local restrictions are adequatelyprotective and comprehensive or market forces are adequate to obviate theneed for any of these proposed Federal regulatory requirements. (For example,are there State regulations that would prevent inappropriate location ofmonofills in floodplains? Do existing insurance requirements accomplishthe same objective as today's floodplains proposal?) If there are suchexisting requirements, to what extent is it appropriate for the Agencyto rely on them in lieu of regulatory provisions in Part 503?Monofills_National Pollutant Limits (andSection; 503.33)<ITAG tagnum="81">Ground-Water Protection Standard</ITAG>The objective in establishing the pollutant limits for the disposal ofsewage sludge in monofills is to ensure that the pollutant concentrationsreaching the ground water do not exceed the drinking water standard or,if no drinking water standard exists, other appropriate human health criteria.This ground-water protection standard is the basis for the Agency's determinationthat the pollutant limits are adequate to protect public health and theenvironment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effect of a pollutant.The Agency used exposure assessment models to simulate the movement ofthe pollutant into and through the soil profile to the ground water. Themodels calculate a pollutant concentration that will not exceed an MCLat the point of compliance. For Class I ground water, the point of complianceis the point where the leachate enters the aquifer. For Class II and ClassIII ground water, the point of compliance is immediately below the propertyboundary or 150 meters from the point of entry to the aquifer, whicheveris less.The critical parameters in the model are those listed in Table 6 of theproposed rule. In selecting the parameters for development of the rule,the Agency made conservative, but reasonable, worst-case choices to assurean adequate level of protection. Therefore, these parameters tend to over-estimatethe mobility of the pollutant out of the sludge matrix, thus reducing thetime for the pollutant to reach the ground water.For example, the model assumes that all pollutants eventually solubilize.However, there is evidence that the pollutants in a sludge matrix are stronglyattached to the matrix and do not go into solution or readily leach tothe ground water. This is particularly the case with sewage sludge, a by-productof wastewater treatment processes. Any readily soluble pollutant wouldbe removed during treatment processes and contained in the effluent leavingthe treatment works, rather than present in sewage sludge. The other criticalparameters are discussed in Part IV of the preamble. This combination ofreasonable worst-case assumptions used in the models has the effect ofincreasing the toxicity and potency of a pollutant, increasing its mobilityto ground water, and intensifying its effect. Thus, this compounding ofconservative factors introduces an added margin of safety in the calculationof the pollutant concentrations. On the basis of these analyses, it isthe Agency's belief that the pollutant concentrations meet the ground waterprotection standard and adequately protect public health and the environment.Today's proposal modifies and expands the approach used in the ``CriteriaFor Classification Of Solid Waste Disposal Facilities and Practices'' (see40 CFR Part 257). andSection; 257.3-4 establishes a general prohibition onthe contamination of an underground drinking water source beyond the solidwaste boundary or beyond an alternative boundary specified in accordancewith the requirements in the rule. This generic standard was not accompaniedby monitoring to ensure compliance.Today's proposal replaces 40 CFR Part 257, as it applies to sewage sludge,with an approach that takes advantage of the information gathered in thepast 10 years. It builds on the ground-water protection standard conceptby establishing limits for the sludge on a pollutant-by-pollutant basisto ensure that the concentration of the pollutant reaching the ground waterwill not exceed the drinking water standard or another appropriate standard.In addition, by requiring the analysis of pollutant concentrations in thesewage sludge placed in a monofill, the Agency is providing a mechanismto ensure that the ground-water protection standard will not be exceeded.Therefore, in preparing today's proposal, the Agency has not carried overthe generic ground-water protection standard in 40 CFR 257.3-4, but isrequesting public comment on whether it should do so as an additional checkon the efficacy of the pollutant-specific sewage sludge limitations.A fundamental regulatory principle used in developing today's rule is pollutionprevention. The Agency believes that it is more protective and equitableto prevent sewage sludge contamination by controlling pollutants at thesource than it is to require clean-up of the contaminated ground water.Therefore, controlling the quality of the sludge placed in the monofillis an over-riding objective of today's standards.This up-front sludge pollution prevention approach is different from thealternative approach taken in the proposed ``Solid Waste Disposal FacilityCriteria'' (see 53 FR 33314, August 30, 1988). The proposed criteria revisionsfor MSWLFs use location, design, and operating criteria to achieve a ground-waterprotection performance standard. In addition to those criteria, the Agencyalso proposed that owners or operators of MSWLFs monitor the ground waterand take corrective action when pollutants in the ground water exceed State-establishedtrigger levels. This ground-water monitoring serves as a method of verifyingthe adequacy of the design and operation of a particular MSWLF. Ground-watermonitoring and corrective action were mandated for the proposed criteriarevisions by Section 4010 of RCRA ``as necessary to detect contamination''.Consistent with the principle of pollution prevention, today's proposalrequires that treatment works monitor the quality of the sludge beforethe sludge is placed in the monofill. The available scientific and technicalinformation indicates that, if the pollutant concentrations do not exceedthe limits in today's proposal, the pollutants are unlikely to migrateto the ground water, especially at levels that exceed the drinking waterstandards. In such circumstances, the Agency believes that requiring ground-watermonitoring and corrective action, in addition to sludge testing, is notjustified by the regulatory record.Because of the characteristics of the sewage sludge that bind the pollutantsinto a sludge matrix, it is highly unlikely that any leaching of the pollutantto the ground would occur within the design life of 30 to 40 years fora monofill. The Agency is requesting public comment on the correctnessof its approach. The Agency is also soliciting comment on whether ground-watermonitoring would be an appropriate protective measure to back-stop theproposed pollutant specific sludge limitations, and on whether correctiveaction should be required if the monitoring indicates that ground-waterprotection standards have been exceeded.The Agency further requests comment on the need for ground-water monitoringand corrective action for those who apply sewage sludge to agriculturaland non-agricultural land and to those who dispose of sewage sludge atsewage sludge surface disposal sites. The Agency is also interested inopinions on the effects of such measures on the beneficial reuse of sewagesludge.<ITAG tagnum="81">Pollutants</ITAG>EPA is proposing numerical limits in the form of pollutant concentrationsfor 18 pollutants when sewage sludge is placed in monofills. Table III-1lists the pollutants that were originally evaluated and Table III-2 liststhe pollutants that do not interfere with the disposal of sewage sludgein monofills. Chlordane, chromium, and nickel were found not to interferewith the disposal of sewage in monofills over Class II or Class III groundwater, but may adversely effect human health or the environment if themonofill is over Class I ground water. Since Class I ground water is irreplaceableas a source of drinking water, the Agency is proposing more stringent numericallimits for monofills over Class I ground water. This will be discussedin depth later in this subpart of the preamble.When the Agency originally evaluated cyanide with the exposure assessmentmodel, significant violations of the cyanide drinking water standard werepredicted because of the following assumptions:andbullet; All of the cyanide in sludge partitions to the leachate;andbullet; No decay of cyanide occurs as the leachate percolates throughthe soil to the ground water; andandbullet; No cyanide precipitates out of solution with metals once the leachatemixes with the ground water.These assumptions were included in the model because no data were availableto quantify the leaching, decay, or precipitation of cyanide compounds.However, under the anaerobic environment below landfills, cyanide wouldbe expected to decompose into ammonia and methane.EPA's Water Engineering Research Laboratory (WERL) investigated the potentialfor cyanide leaching from sewage sludge (Reference number 76). Sewage sludgesamples were collected from POTWs in 12 cities in Ohio serving populationsfrom 5,000 to 400,000. The 12 samples were split, with half the samplesanalyzed by WERL and half sent to an EPA contract laboratory. The contractlaboratories extracted the samples using the zero head space extractorprocedure outlined in the TCLP (40 CFR Part 261, Appendix II).Standard methods were used to analyze the sludge samples and TCLP extractsfor total cyanide, weak acid dissociable cyanide, and percent solids. Thequality control checks for the analyses indicated good precision and excellentrecovery of spiked cyanide.The sludge samples contained concentrations of total cyanide ranging from0.9 to 605 ppm but analyses showed no detectable levels of cyanide in anyof the leachate samples. The study demonstrated that cyanide forms complexeswith the metals in sewage sludge and thus does not readily leach from thesludge. From these results, EPA concluded that its assumption on the amountof cyanide leaching from the sludge matrix was in error. Therefore, theAgency is not proposing a numerical limit for cyanide in sewage sludgethat is disposed of in a monofill.Table III-3 lists pollutants for which the Agency has deferred proposinga numerical limit until sufficient data become available to use in itsexposure assessment model. As noted earlier in the preamble, EPA has recentlyestablished human health criteria for methylethyl ketone and methylenechloride. Therefore, these two pollutants will be evaluated in future Part503 rulemaking proceedings.For EPA to establish a numerical limit for cobalt, an MCL or an acceptabledaily intake value would be needed. For phenanthrene, the Agency needsdata on the soil half-life of phenanthrene and an MCL or sufficient datato establish a risk specific dose or an RfD. The Agency is seeking dataon these pollutants and is requesting that commenters send available datato facilitate the evaluation of these pollutants in future Part 503 rulemakingproceedings.<ITAG tagnum="81">Bases of Polutant Limits</ITAG>Table 5 in andSection; 503.33 of the proposed rule lists the 18 pollutantsfor which the Agency is proposing numerical limits. These numerical limitsare established so that the concentration of the pollutant will not exceeda human health criterion at the point of compliance for Class I groundwater. The point of compliance is where the leachate enters the groundwater. For Class II and Class III ground water, the point of complianceis immediately below the property boundary of the monofill or 150 metersfrom the point of entry, whichever is less. The human health criteria are:(1) MCLs established under the Safe Drinking Water Act, (2) a risk specificdose corresponding to an incremental carcinogenic risk level of 1andmultiply;10^4(one cancer incident in 10,000) for carcinogenic pollutants that have noMCL, or (3) an RfD for non-carcinogenic pollutants that have no MCL. Forthe reasons described earlier, EPA is using existing Agency standards asthe human health criteria in the models. MCLs were used for arsenic, benzene,cadmium, copper, lead, lindane, mercury, trichloroethylene, and toxaphene.The Agency used a risk specific dose and an incremental carcinogenic risklevel of 1andmultiply;10^4 as the human health criteria for benzo(a)pyrene,bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, chlordane, DDT/DDE/DDD, dimethylnitrosamine,and PCBs.A key factor in establishing numerical limits for sewage sludge placedin monofills is the class of ground water under the monofill. As discussedearlier, owners and operators, in conjunction with the appropriate Stateagency, need to classify their ground water in accordance with the definitionsin andSection; 503.31 (b), (c), or (d)(1), (d)(2), or (d)(3).Figure IX-D.2 shows the circumstances under which the national pollutantlimits in andSection; 503.33(a) apply and those under which the case-by-casepollutant limits in andSection; 503.33(b) apply.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 361</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">National Limits</ITAG>EPA is proposing national numerical limits for the pollutants in Table5 of andSection; 503.33 of the proposal. These values apply to monofillswhere the boundaries of the sewage sludge units are 150 meters or morefrom the property boundary of the monofill. If the distances are less than150 meters, EPA calculates case-by-case numerical limits.The national numerical limits apply to monofills over Class I, Class II,and Class III ground water unless the ground water is not a source of drinkingwater because the background ground-water pollutant concentrations exceedthe MCL or other human health criteria listed in Appendix A of the proposedrule. For monofills located over ground water in which the background pollutantconcentrations exceed the values in Appendix A, the procedure in andSection;503.33(b) (2) is used to establish case-by-case numerical limits.As shown in Table 5 of the rule, one set of values applies to monofillsover Class I ground water. A different set of values applies to monofillsover Class II ground water, as well as to those over Class III ground waterthat is not a source of drinking water because either TDS levels exceed10,000 milligrams per liter or the yields are insufficient to supply theneeds of an average household (i.e., 150 gallons per day).Although Class III ground water is not used as a source of drinking waterbecause of TDS or yield limitations, the Agency does not believe that ClassIII ground water should be allowed to deteriorate. At some future time,technology may become available to reduce TDS levels. Moreover, the needfor ground water may be so acute in water scarce areas that concepts ofthe yields necessary to supply an average household (150 gallons per day)may not be valid.If the pollutant concentrations of the sewage sludge to be disposed ofin a monofill exceed the values in Table 5, the owner or operator of themonofill or treatment work (if different from that of the monofill), maysubmit data, in accordance with the procedures in andSection; 503.33(b)(3),documenting that values other than those listed in Table 6 of the ruleshould be used in calculating a numerical limit using the EPA or otherapproved model. The discussion below describes how EPA will use site-specificdata to calculate alternative pollutant concentrations.<ITAG tagnum="81">Case-By-Case Limits</ITAG>As discussed in Part VIII of the preamble, when EPA uses the exposure assessmentmodels to establish numerical limits, alternative numerical limits maybe established on a case-by-case basis when the physical parameters ata site differ from those used in the model. In developing the standardsfor monofills, EPA is proposing three circumstances under which the Agencywould establish case-by-case numerical limits. Sections 503.33(b) (1) and(2) mandate the calculation of case-by-case numerical limits. Section 503.33(b)(3)allows case-by-case numerical limits when the values in Table 5 are exceeded.Each subparagraph of andSection; 503.33(b) is discussed in turn below.When a monofill has a sewage sludge unit that is less than 150 meters fromthe property boundary of the monofill, andSection; 503.33(b)(1) requiresEPA to calculate numerical limits for the pollutants in Table 5. The Agencywould use the actual distance to the property boundary as the amount ofdilution that would be factored into the EPA-approved exposure assessmentmodel so that numerical limits will not exceed the human health criteriaat the point of compliance (i.e., the property boundary). For the otherparameters in the model, EPA will use the values in Table 6 unless theowner or operator can demonstrate that other site-specific values shouldbe used. In the latter case, EPA will use the site-specific values in accordancewith andSection; 503.33(b)(3) discussed below.Section 503.33(b)(2) requires EPA to calculate case-by-case numerical limitsfor those monofills over ground water categorized as Class III becausethe background ground water concentration of one or more pollutants exceedsthe values in Appendix A of the rule. The values in Appendix A are theMCLs, the risk specific doses corresponding to an incremental carcinogenicrisk level of 1andmultiply;10^\4\, or the RfDs, as appropriate. Owners oroperators of monofills are to supply EPA with the background ground waterconcentration for those pollutants exceeding the values in Appendix A.EPA will then calculate a concentration for the pollutant in sewage sludgeso that further degradation of the ground water will not occur becauseof the disposal of sewage sludge in a monofill. For other parameters inthe model, EPA will use the values in Table 6 of the rule. For those pollutantsthat do not exceed the values in Appendix A, the values in Table 5 apply.If the concentrations of one or more pollutants exceed the limits listedin Table 5, andSection; 503.33(b)(3) allows the owner or operator to submitdocumentation that site-specific data, rather than the values shown inTable 6, should be used in calculating the pollutant concentrations forsewage sludge placed in the particular monofill. EPA will recalculate thenumerical limits for all pollutants listed in Table 5 using the site-specificdata that the owner or operator submits for the parameters in Table 6.If owners or operators choose not to submit data for one or more of theparameters in Table 6, EPA will use the values in Table 6.The parameters included in Table 6 are depth to ground water, partitioncoefficient for the unsaturated zone, soil type, net ground-water rechargerate, ground-water electromotive potential (Eh), and ground-water pH. Asdiscussed previously, these are the parameters that, if changed, make asignificant difference in the allowable pollutant concentrations (i.e.,the pollutant concentration in sewage sludge that does not exceed an MCLor other human health criterion at the point of compliance). The ``TechnicalSupport Document: Landfilling of Sewage Sludge'' (Reference number 58)documents the values for the parameters in Table 6 and lists the sourcesfor, and the ways in which owners and operators may determine, the site-specificvalues for these six parameters.If one or more of the parameters in Table 6 is changed, EPA would calculatenew numerical limits for all pollutants in Table 5. The reason for thisapproach is that a parameter may affect different pollutants in differentways. For example, if changes were made in ground-water pH or net ground-waterEh, the allowable pollutant concentration of some metals would increasewhile the allowable pollutant concentration of other metals would decrease.Since the model EPA used can calculate the numerical limits simultaneously,it is a simple and straight-forward procedure to recalculate all the numericallimits.The rule allows site-specific modeling to derive the numerical concentrationlimits for sludge disposed of in monofills. The rule does not precludethe applicant from incorporating into the model the sites's artifical characteristics(e.g., a synthetic liner) in addition to its natural characteristics (e.g.,a natural clay liner). The applicant is thus not prevented from incorporatingthe effect that containment measures would have on infiltration or rechargeflow rates through the fill material and on the porosity and pollutantsorption beneath the fill. The numerical limits are thus capable of beingmodified to account for the effect of containment measures such as liners.Nevertheless, the Agency's model was not developed with the specific intentof describing the behavior of liners or other containment measures. Furthermore,in its current form it cannot account for any deterioration in containmenteffectiveness that may occur over time. The Agency is soliciting commenton whether the model should be modified to account for the effect of linersand the assumptions that the Agency should use in doing so.If the sewage sludge that a treatment work wishes to place in a monofillcontinues to exceed the numerical limits in Table 5 or the numerical limitsthat EPA calculated on a case-by-case basis, the treatment work must eitherreduce the concentration of the pollutants through more stringent localpretreatment limits or find an alternative way of managing the sewage sludge.As discussed in Part XI of the preamble, the Agency estimates that allof the facilities are likely to exceed the numerical limits in Table 5.However, this estimate does not take into account the possibility thatsome sewage sludge may come into compliance when site-specific data isused to re-calculate numerical limits.<ITAG tagnum="81">Lead</ITAG>The concentration for lead in Table 5 of the proposal is based on the existingMCL of 50 (andCx.18;g/l). The Agency has proposed a new MCL for lead (see53 FR 31516, August 18, 1988) of 5 andCx.18;g/l in water leaving the drinkingwater plant. Because lead frequently leaches from pipes, the Agency proposedthat, if a specified number of ``morning first draw'' tap water samplesexceed 10 andCx.18;g/l, public water supply systems would be required toimplement a State-approved treatment plan. Although EPA proposed a numberof alternatives and received public comment on them, the Agency is seekingpublic comment today on whether 5 or 10 andCx.18;g/l should be the basisof the numerical concentrations for monofills. The effect of using 5 or10 andCx.18;g/l lead limitations is shown below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s30,12,r50</C> <H1>MCL</H1><H1>Class I ground water</H1><H1>Class II and III(1) and (3) ground water</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">5 andCx.18;g/l<D>0.068</D><D>37.9 andCx.18;g/l</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10 andCx.18;g/l<D>0.079</D><D>82.1 andCx.18;g/l</D></ITAG></ITAG>The Agency requests public comment on the lead level it should use as thehuman health criterion.<ITAG tagnum="81">Non-Degradation of Class III Ground Water</ITAG>The Agency also seeks guidance on the approach it is proposing for ClassIII ground water that is not a drinking water source because the backgroundground-water concentration of one or more pollutants exceeds the valuesin Appendix A. Under the proposed approach, numerical limits would be setso that the background ground-water concentration of a pollutant wouldnot be exceeded.The Agency is proposing this approach because it does not want any furtherdegradation of ground water in case future technological advances allowpublic treatment systems to treat polluted ground water economically. However,EPA recognizes that this approach is relatively more stringent for groundwater that is not a source of drinking water than the approach for ClassII ground water that is a current or potential source of drinking wateror the approach for Class III ground water that is not a source of drinkingbecause of TDS levels or yield limitations. For Class II ground water andfor the other two categories of Class III ground water, EPA is establishingnumerical limits to prevent pollutants from exceeding the MCL or otherappropriate human health criteria. Potentially, pollutant levels in monofillslocated over high quality ground water (i.e., ground water with pollutantconcentrations below the MCL or other human health criteria) could increaseas long as the pollutant levels did not exceed the MCL or other appropriatehuman health criteria. The Agency is seeking public comment on whetherthe basis of the numerical limits for this type of Class III ground watershould be some value other than background concentrations.In addition, the Agency is soliciting public comment on the need to propose,and the basis of numerical limits for, a ``non-degradation policy'' forall ground water underlying a monofill. Such a policy would require ownersor operators to analyze their ground water for background ground waterconcentrations, regardless of the class of ground water under the monofill.It would also require the Agency or the permitting authority to set case-by-casenumerical limits for all monofills; no national limits would be establishedin the rule. Under a ``non-degradation'' policy for Class I and Class IIground water, numerical limits for monofills could be based on backgroundconcentration or a percentage over background concentration.Monofills_Management Practices (andSection;503.34)<ITAG tagnum="81">Daily Cover Requirement</ITAG>Today's proposal requires that suitable cover material be applied at theend of each operating day or at more frequent intervals, if necessary,to control disease vectors, gas venting, odors, and scavenging. Coveringthe wastes helps control disease vectors, rodents, and odors if putresciblewastes are placed in the monofill. Cover material also reduces air emissionsfrom the monofill, lessens the risk and spread of fires, and reduces infiltrationof rainwater, which, in turn, decreases leachate generation and potentialsurface and ground water contamination. As an additional benefit, dailycover enhances the appearance of an otherwise aesthetically displeasingsite and may increase the number of beneficial uses for the site aftercompletion of the filling activities. Cover is normally applied over sludgethe same day that the sludge is placed in trenches. The soil excavatedduring trench construction provides the material that is used for dailycover.EPA is not specifying the type or amount of cover material to be used,leaving the determination of ``suitable material'' and minimum cover depthup to the permitting authority. However, good engineering practice suggeststhat a 6-inch depth of compacted earthen material be used as cover material.Tests have shown that 6 inches of compacted sandy loam soil prevents flyemergence, and daily (or more frequent) cover has been shown to reducethe attraction of birds and to discourage rodents from burrowing into thewaste (Reference number 77).Nineteen States and territories have requirements for daily, intermediate,or final cover. Seven States require 6 inches of daily cover and one Staterequires 12 inches. One State requires 6 inches of daily cover over stabilizedsludges and 2 feet over unstabilized sludges. Four other States requireonly that solid waste and sludge be covered at the end of each day.Intermediate cover is specified by two States. One requires 24 inches ofintermediate cover, while the other does not specify a depth for the requiredintermediate cover. Eight States specify a depth of final cover. Six Statesrequire 2 feet and two States require 3 feet (Reference number 52). Inthe closure plan, EPA requires owners or operators to provide a final coverand to maintain that final cover for 10 years. EPA requests comments onthe daily cover requirement and whether there are circumstances when EPAshould exempt the requirement.<ITAG tagnum="81">Methane Gas Monitoring</ITAG>The decomposition of sewage sludge produces methane gas that, if allowedto accumulate, can migrate to monofill structures or nearby off site structuresresulting in fire and explosions and potentially injuring or killing employeesand occupants of nearby structures. EPA established an explosive gas criterionin 40 CFR 257.3-8(a) to regulate the concentration of methane in facilitystructures and at the property boundary. This requirement is expanded intoday's proposal consistent with the proposal for MSWLFs.Section 503.34(b) requires that the concentration of methane gas generatedin a sewage sludge monofill shall not exceed 1.25 percent methane in anystructure within the sewage sludge monofill and shall not exceed 5.0 percentmethane at the property line of the sewage sludge monofill. Five percentmethane is the lower explosive limit (LEL). This is the lowest percentage,by volume, of a mixture of explosive gases that will flame at 25 degreesCelsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) at atmospheric sea level pressure. Today'sproposal would require that the concentration of methane generated by themonofills not exceed 25 percent of the LEL (i.e., 1.25 percent methane)in facility structures (excluding gas control or recovery system components)and the LEL itself at the property boundary. EPA based its selection ofthe 25-percent criterion on a safety factor recognized by other Federalagencies as being appropriate for similar situations (Reference number77). The Agency is not requiring the same 25-percent criterion at the propertyboundary, since gases at or below the LEL at the property boundary willbecome diffused before passing into any structure beyond the property boundary.Requiring that the LEL for methane not be exceeded at the property boundaryprotects against offsite explosions. The Agency believes that the limitsin andSection;503.34(b) adequately protect public safety without being undulyrestrictive.For owners and operators to comply with the methane gas requirement, theywill have to install (if they have not already done so) equipment to monitormethane continuously in the buildings and at the property boundary. Thisequipment must be maintained for 10 years after closure, as required byandSection;503.32(m)(3). Twenty-eight States have gas monitoring requirementsfor landfills.<ITAG tagnum="81">Other Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)</ITAG>By limiting the concentration of methane gas to 1.25 percent in buildingslocated in monofills, the Agency believes that other volatile organic compounds(VOCs), such as trichloroethylene, that may still be present in sewagesludge should not pose any human health problems. The sewage sludge placedin monofills will be digested to meet a minimum of Class B pathogen reductionrequirements. Digestion raises the temperature of the sewage sludge andevaporates most, if not all, of the volatile portion of the organic compounds.Any remaining VOCs are unlikely to represent more than a tiny fractionof the gases (largely methane) produced by the degradation of the organiccompounds in the monofill. Therefore, the Agency did not examine the potentialfor human health effects associated with volatile organic compounds fromthe uncovered surface of the monofill which might seep into facility structuresduring the working portion of the day. EPA believes that the evaporationof VOCs from the open portion of the monofill, rather than seepage, wouldlikely pose a greater health risk. However, the Agency will carefully examineand consider evidence indicating that its assumptions are incorrect.In its proposal for MSWLFs, EPA proposed to regulate other gases becausethese landfills appear to be a source of air pollutants (see 53 FR 33338,August 30, 1988). Gases of decomposition originate within a municipal landfilland vent to the atmosphere by vertical migration or lateral migration.Landfill gas is generated by chemical reactions and by microbial degradationof refuse materials into a variety of simpler compounds. Typically, landfillgas consists of nearly 50 percent methane, 50 percent carbon dioxide, andtrace constituents of VOCs and other toxic constituents. Pollutants commonlyfound in gas at municipal landfills include vinyl chloride, benzene, trichloroethylene,and methylene chloride. Some of these compounds can create an unpleasantodor nuisance, while the VOCs and other toxic emissions can constitutea health hazard. This is in addition to the dangers from the explosivepotential of methane. EPA decided to regulate air emissions from MSWLFsunder section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act, for new landfills, and section111(d) for existing landfills. Under section 111(d), EPA is preparing airemission guidelines that are to be adopted by the States. They will prepareplans for controlling existing sources of air emissions from municipallandfills, according to the EPA guidelines. The regulations will be basedon both collecting and controlling landfill gas. EPA plans to propose airemission standards for these landfills in the near future.EPA is uncertain that similar air pollution problems are prevalent at monofills.The Agency is soliciting data on any monofill air monitoring by Statesto assist in determining if regulation of air emissions from landfillsshould be expanded to include the 49 existing monofills and any new monofills.<ITAG tagnum="81">Access Controls</ITAG>Section 503.34(c) requires that access to monofills be controlled, as appropriate,to protect human health and the environment from methane gas hazards andother hazards that could result from disturbing the monofill cover. Accesscontrols are also necessary to prevent illegal dumping and to keep unauthorizedvehicular traffic from disturbing the monofill cover. Keeping trespassersoff sludge landfills is important because the sludge may not be sufficientlystable to support their weight. Unauthorized access to monofills may beprevented by placing gates with locks at all entrances (access roads) tothe site. Other provisions may need to be investigated on a site-by-sitebasis. EPA is allowing owners and operators the flexibility to implementsystems appropriate for their facilities based on the characteristics oftheir sites, but signs and gates should be posted across access roads evenin remote areas. Twenty States require access controls to landfills.Pathogen Reduction Requirements (andSection; 503.35)Section 503.35 requires that sludge placed in monofills meet, at a minimum,the Class B pathogen reduction requirements in andSection; 503.52(b) of therule. As explained elsewhere in the preamble, Class B pathogen reductionrequirements include requirements for access and use restrictions. Theaccess restrictions in Subpart D of today's proposal are more restrictivethan those for the Class B pathogen reduction standards and therefore govern.EPA is including pathogen reduction requirements for sewage sludge disposedof monofills even though the Agency is not aware of any incident in whichillnesses have been attributed to pathogens from monofills. A review ofthe literature (see Reference number 78) indicates that, potentially, pathogenscould pose a problem if monofills were located in sandy soils. This conclusionwas based on field studies of the transport and fate of viruses from septictanks. The results of these studies suggest that enteroviruses can travelsubstantial distances. In one study, researchers added a single dose ofvaccine poliovirus type 1 (derived from cell culture or from stools ofrecently vaccinated infants) to several septic tank systems. In all cases,the researchers found the viruses persisted for several months and reachedthe ground water or traveled to nearby bodies of water. Little virus removaloccurred during transport through the unsaturated zone. Although no studieshave been conducted on sewage sludge placed in monofills to determine ifthe viruses exhibit similar survival and mobility in a sludge matrix, thehigh organic content in sludge is unlikely to retard the movement of viruses.Bacterial movement through the soil surface appears to be more restrictedthan that of viruses, although rainfall can increase bacterial migrationby increasing infiltration rates. However, if bacteria are able to penetrateto the saturated zone, they appear capable of being transmitted significantdistances in sandy and gravel soils, although significant reductions mayoccur from the travel distance. EPA believes that the requirement for dailycover and for the collection of runoff should reduce potential bacteriaproblems at monofills.EPA's Office of Research and Development has undertaken an assessment ofthe potential pathogenic risks from monofills (see Reference number 79)and intends to prepare a quantitative pathogen risk assessment methodology.When the results of the assessment are complete, EPA will re-evaluate theneed for additional requirements beyond those in the Class B requirements.However, without additional data on the concentration of pathogens in theleachate or the decay rate of pathogens in the leachate, the Agency willassume that no further decay of pathogens occurs subsequent to the ClassB reduction. Such an assumption may not be entirely valid. Therefore, theAgency is requesting laboratory or field data that may assist it in predictingthe fate of pathogens from monofills.As an alternative to the pathogen reduction requirements, particularlyfor monofills located in sandy soils, the Agency could require owners oroperators to add liners. The Agency is soliciting comment on the alternativeof requiring liners instead of imposing pathogen reduction standards.Monitoring, Record Keeping, and Reports (andSection; 503.81 and andSection;503.84)Owners and operators of monofills are to measure the concentration of thepollutants listed in Table 5 at the frequencies established for the designcapacity of the treatment work and with the sampling and analysis proceduresin andSection; 503.81. Owners and operators must also monitor the sewagesludge to demonstrate compliance with the Class B pathogen reduction requirements,continuously monitor the methane gas at the property boundary, and monitorthe volume and concentration of the pollutants in runoff. Section 503.81(b)lists the analytical methods for sampling and analyzing the sewage sludgefor the constituents in Table 5 and for pathogenic bacteria, animal viruses,fecal coliform, fecal streptococci, protozoa and helminth ova.EPA is proposing that owners and operators keep the records required inandSection; 503.84 for a period of 10 years. Ten years is the proposed periodof time that the final cover is to be maintained, methane gas monitored,and access to the monofill restricted. The records to be kept and the reportsto be submitted ensure that owners and operators of monofills will complywith the monitoring and verification requirements of the rule. Owners andoperators must certify that the monofill:andbullet; Does not cause or contribute to the harm of threatened or endangeredspecies or their habitat, does not restrict the flow of a base flood, doesnot reduce the temporary water storage capacity of a floodplain, and doesnot present a hazard to human health, wildlife, or land or water resources;andbullet; Does not attract birds that present a hazard to aircraft if themonofill is located either within 3,048 meters (10,000 feet) of aircraftrunways used by turbine-powered aircraft or 1,524 meters (5,000 feet) ofan airport runway used only by piston engine-powered aircraft;andbullet; Is designed to withstand stress created by the maximum groundmotion if the monofill is located in a siesmic zone;andbullet; Is located 60 meters or more from a fault that has had displacementin Holocene time;andbullet; Is located in areas that adequately support the structural componentsof the unit; andandbullet; Is located outside the perimeter of wetland areas.In addition, the monofill owner or operator must report the concentrationof the pollutants in sewage sludge, level of pathogen reductions achieved,the record of the methane gas concentration in any structure within themonofill boundary and at the property boundary, the volume of runoff treatedand discharged, and the concentration of the pollutants in the discharge.These monitoring, record keeping, and reports relate to key elements withinSubpart D and were described throughout the discussion of the requirementsfor monofills.<ITAG tagnum="84">Surface Disposal Sites (Subpart E)</ITAG>Applicability (andSection; 503.40)The requirements contained in this proposal apply to surface disposal sitesreceiving only sewage sludge. The requirements also apply to any personwho disposes of sewage sludge on a sewage sludge disposal site.Specialized Definitions (andSection; 503.41)<ITAG tagnum="81">Surface Disposal Sites</ITAG>There are a number of different ways to apply sewage sludge to the landfor reuse or disposal. Sewage sludge applied to agricultural and non-agriculturalland, and the distribution and marketing of sewage sludge, generally isdone to use the nutrient and soil conditioning properties of the sewagesludge. Applying sewage sludge to dedicated, non-agricultural land, however,is an exception. This practice does not use the nutrient and soil conditioningproperties for a beneficial use. Rather, it is a disposal method that usesthe soil to bind the metals and uses soil microorganisms, sunlight, andoxidation to destroy the organic matter in the sludge. Disposing of sewagesludge in monofills is also a method of disposal that does not use thebeneficial characteristics of the sewage sludge.The Agency has identified another disposal method that, while similar tosome disposal methods and treatment practices, such as surface impoundments,is not strictly covered by those terms. In this method of disposal, sewagesludge is placed on the surface of the land in ``piles''. The Agency iscalling this method of disposal, sewage sludge surface disposal.The Agency defines a surface disposal site as an area of land on whichonly sewage sludge is placed for a period of one year or longer. Surfacedisposal sites do not have a vegetative or other cover. The one year timeperiod is used to differentiate surface disposal from treatment or storage.As explained elsewhere in the preamble, today's proposal only covers finaluse or disposal methods, not treatment processes or storage.In 1984, when the Agency initiated the Part 503 rulemaking process, surfacedisposal sites were considered surface impoundments that were used fortreatment or interim storage, not use or disposal facilities. Subsequently,the Agency learned that some communities use surface impoundments for extendedperiods of time, suggesting that the practice is the community's methodof disposal. When surface impoundments are used for the final disposalof sewage sludge, they are surface disposal sites and are subject to theCWA's requirements as a disposal method. The CWA requires the Agency todevelop standards for all use or disposal methods that are adequate toprotect human health and the environment from any adverse effect of eachpollutant.The Agency identified approximately 5,600 facilities that dispose of 476,500dry metric tons of sewage sludge by ``other'' practices, some of whichmay include surface disposal sites to dispose of 200,000 dry metric tonsof sewage sludge. The Agency believes that approximately 2,400 POTWs usesurface disposal sites for the disposal of their sewage sludge.Based on available information, the Agency believes that surface disposalsites generally are small, are located in rural areas on lands owned orcontrolled by local governments, and do not expose individuals to significantconcentrations of pollutants. EPA is collecting additional informationon the location, size, and the physical characteristics of surface disposalsites, as well as on the characteristics and quality of sewage sludge placedon, and the typical management practices associated with, surface disposalsites. This information will be used to evaluate the human health and environmentalimpacts of treatment works using surface disposal sites.The Agency has initiated work to develop an exposure assessment model forsurface disposal sites in much the same way it developed exposure assessmentmodels for other methods of use and disposal. Where possible, the Agencywill use existing equations to simulate the movement of pollutants froma surface disposal site into the air, ground water, and surface water.The Agency is soliciting suggestions on modifications that it should maketo either the monofill or land application models to develop a surfacedisposal model.After completing the exposure assessment model, the Agency will evaluateMEI and aggregate exposure from surface disposal sites. Information onthe likely exposure of individuals and the aggregate effects of surfacedisposal sites, as well as comments on today's proposal, will be used inevaluating the appropriateness of the standards for sewage sludge disposedof on such sites.For the purpose of regulation, the Agency has tried to distinguish surfacedisposal from land application to dedicated non-agricultural land and fromdisposal in monofills. Despite the similarities, there are differencesbetween surface disposal and dedicated non-agricultural land application.On a surface disposal site, no vegetative cover is established on the sewagesludge. However, on dedicated non-agricultural land, a vegetative coveris established.By the same token, if a surface disposal site is surrounded by a containmentwall or if the sewage sludge is placed in a natural topographic depressionor a man-made excavation, it resembles a monofill. Again, however, thereare differences. One of the main differences is that no daily or finalcover is established over the sewage sludge on a surface disposal site.Under the same conditions, surface disposal sites may also resemble sewagesludge treatment facilities such as pits, ponds, and lagoons. The distinguishingfeature, though, is that a surface disposal site is the ultimate methodof disposal, rather than part of the wastewater or sewage sludge treatmentprocesses.The Agency is soliciting comment on whether it should distinguish surfacedisposal from dedicated non-agricultural land application and from disposalin monofills. Comment is also solicited on the use of a 1-year time periodto distinguish surface disposal from treatment or storage. Some treatmentpractices, such as composting, may take as long as 50 weeks. The Agencyconsidered and is soliciting comment on regulating surface disposal sites,dedicated non-agricultural land, and monofills in a similar manner withoutregard to current practice. This approach would force all current practicesto conform to the same standards (i.e., cover, etc.) based on the characteristicsof the disposal method, rather than on the anticipated human health andenvironmental effects of the practice.The remaining definitions in andSection; 503.41 of the rule are identicalto the definitions in andSection; 503.31 for monofills.General Requirements (andSection; 503.42)The requirements for surface disposal sites are similar to those for non-agriculturalland, except for the vegetative cover, and similar to those for monofills,except for the daily cover, the determination of the class of ground waterunder the site, and a closure plan. The Agency is not requiring that ownersor operators of surface disposal sites have a vegetative or other coveron the sewage sludge because covers may not be necessary to protect humanhealth and the environment.The Agency is not requiring owners and operators to determine the classof ground water under their site because the pollutant limits for surfacedisposal sites are based on ``current sludge quality'' (i.e., the 98th-percentilepollutant concentration shown in the ``40 City Study'') and are not contingenton the class of ground water under the site, as they are for monofills.The Agency is requesting public comment on requiring a closure plan forsurface disposal sites and the requirements for the closure plan. For monofills,the Agency is requiring a final cover and, for 10 years, maintenance ofthe final cover, methane gas monitoring, and restrictions on public access.EPA requests opinions and information on the efficacy of these provisions,particularly since the Agency is not proposing a daily cover, and on theneed for a closure plan when one is not required for dedicated non-agriculturalland application.EPA believes that the other general requirements for dedicated non-agriculturalland and for monofills are applicable to surface disposal sites. Surfacedisposal sites should not threaten endangered species or their criticalhabitat, restrict the flow of a base flood, reduce the temporary waterstorage capacity of a floodplain, or present a hazard to human health,wildlife, or land or water resources due to a washout of the sewage sludge.In addition, if a surface disposal site is located near an airport, thesewage sludge disposed on the site should not pose a hazard to aircraftby attracting birds to the site.EPA is proposing that sewage sludge surface disposal sites located in aseismic zone be designed to withstand the maximum ground level acceleration.The Agency further proposes that surface disposal sites be located 60 metersor more from a fault that has had displacement in Holocene time; locatedin areas where there is adequate support for the site; and located outsidethe perimeter of wetland areas. If surface disposal sites are located closerthan 60 meters from a fault that has had displacement in Holocene time,located in unstable areas, or located in wetland areas, they would haveto be closed within 1 year. These facilities must close within a year becauseSection 405(d)(2)(D) of the CWA requires compliance with the requirementsof these rules within 1 year.The Agency is also requiring that owners or operators collect the volumeof water from the 24-hour, 25-year storm event that runs off a surfacedisposal site and that they discharge the water in accordance with an applicableNPDES permit. This requirement precludes sewage sludge from washing outof the surface disposal site and endangering human health and environment.As proposed, the requirements for surface disposal sites apply to activesites still receiving sewage sludge. The Agency is seeking public commenton whether any or all of the requirements in andSection; 503.42 should applyto sites that have not received sewage sludge for more than one year.Surface Disposal Sites_Pollutant Limits (andSection; 503.43)Figure IX-E.1 shows the key elements in determining whether or not sewagesludge may be disposed of on surface disposal sites.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 390</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>The pollutant limits for sewage sludge placed on surface disposal sitesare shown in Table 7 of the proposed rule. The Agency is proposing to use``current sludge quality'' (i.e., the 98th-percentile pollutant concentrations)as the basis of the pollutant concentrations for surface disposal sitesbecause the aggregate effects analysis is expected to show a low incidenceof adverse human health effects from this disposal method. Since surfacedisposal sites are generally small and are located on municipal propertyaway from population centers, few individuals are likely to ingest thepollutants from the sludge by drinking water from wells located near surfacedisposal sites or inhale the vapors from surface disposal sites. If theseassumptions are incorrect, the Agency will propose an alternative approachbased on the exposure assessment model that is currently under development.The numerical limits for surface disposal sites correspond to the 98th-percentilepollutant concentrations unless the exposure assessment model calculatesa higher pollutant concentration for monofills located over Class I groundwater. In the latter case, the Agency is proposing the higher pollutantconcentration calculated by the model. The higher pollutant concentrationsare based on the stringent assumptions in the model for Class I groundwater. In other words, the pollutant levels in the leachate cannot exceedthe MCLs because the facility is located in a sandy soil immediately overthe ground water. The pollutant concentrations for DDT/DDE/DDD (total),lindane, toxaphene, and benzo(a)pyrene are based on the monofill modelrather than the 98th-percentile pollutant concentration. There are two main reasons why the model calculates a higher pollutantconcentration than the 98th-percentile concentration for these organicpollutants. The concentration values reported for organic pollutants inthe ``40 City Study'' may not accurately reflect the actual concentrationsin the sewage sludge. At the time the ``40 City Study' data were collected,the analytical techniques used in the Study were not as sophisticated orprecise as current techniques and they had higher limits of detection forogranic pollutants. In effect, concentrations or organic pollutants werenot detected. It is likely that the National Sewage Sludge Survey willfind these compounds in sewage sludge. Even if these compounds are found,the models may still calculate a less stringent limit for DDT/DDE/DDD (total),lindane, and toxaphene because these are high molecular-weight, chlorinatedorganic pollutants that have a low solubility in water and, therefore,do not leach to the ground water. The models also may calculate a lessstringent concentration for benzo(a)pyrene than the 98th-percentile concentrationbecause the partition coefficient for benzo(a)pyrene is very high. Thismeans that only a small portion of the pollutant goes into solution andleaches to the ground water.Surface Disposal Sites_Management Practices (andSection; 503.44) The requirement that owners or operators monitor methane gas is the samefor surface disposal sites as for monofills. Methane gas forms during thedecomposition of organic pollutants under the anaerobic conditions in thelayer of sludge at the bottom of the surface disposal site and could accumulate.The Agency is proposing that owners or operators monitor for methane gas,either in buildings located within the boundary of the surface disposalsite or at the property boundary, to protect against any potential accumulationto levels that could endanger public safety.  EPA is proposing that crops not be grown for human consumption on a surfacedisposal site, that vegetation growing on a surface disposal site not befed to animals, and that animals raised for human consumption not be grazedon the vegetation. The reason for these requirements is that vegetationmay spontaneously grow at surface disposal sites. If this occurs, careshould be taken to ensure that animals do not graze on the vegetation andthat individuals do not harvest the vegetation for subsequent feeding toanimals or humans.Access controls are to be erected to prevent unauthorized entry to thesurface disposal site. This requirement is designed to protect the publicfrom methane gas and from walking on an unstable surface. The access controlsshould also assist in guarding against any illegal dumping. Pathogen And Vector Attraction Reduction Requirements (andSection; 503.45)The Agency is proposing that sewage sludge placed in surface disposal sitesmeet at least the Class B pathogen reduction requirements to reduce thespead of pathogenic organisms from the surface disposal site. The basisof this requirement is the study, described in the discussion of monofills,that shows the migration of pathogenic organisms from septic tanks locatedin sandy soils. As in the case of monofills, the Agency is requesting commenton whether the pathogen reduction requirement for sewage sludge on surfacedisposal sites should be waived if a liner is installed. In addition, theAgency is requesting comment on whether it should allow Class C pathogenreduction for sewage sludge disposed of on surface disposal sites, as itdoes for dedicated non-agricultural lands. EPA is requiring that sewage sludge disposed of on surface disposal sitesmeets one of the vector attraction reduction requirements in andSection;503.53. The Agency did not propose that sewage sludge placed in monofillsmeet the vector attraction reduction requirements because the sewage sludgeis covered daily. A daily cover should provide sufficient protection againstthe attraction of vectors to the sewage sludge and the subsequent spreadof pathogenic organisms from the monofill. However, the Agency is not proposinga similar daily cover provision for surface disposal sites and, therefore,believes that the vector attraction reduction requirements in andSection;503.53 are needed to reduce the attraction of vectors to the sewage sludgeand the potential spread of pathogenic organisms from the surface disposalsite. The vector attraction reduction requirement for surface disposalsites is the same as the requirement for dedicated non-agricultural land.Monitoring, Record Keeping, And Report Requirements (andSection;andSection;503.81 and 503.85) Owners and operators of surface disposal sites are to measure the concentrationof the pollutants listed in Table 7 of the rule at the frequencies establishedfor the design capacity of the treatment work and with the sampling andanalysis procedures in andSection; 503.81. Owners or operators must monitorthe sewage sludge to ensure compliance with the Class A or Class B pathogenreduction requirements, monitor the methane gas at the property boundary,and monitor the volume and concentration of the pollutants in the runoff.Section 503.81(b) lists the analytical methods for these analyses. EPA is proposing that the specified records be kept for 5 years, a requirementof the State program management regulation (40 CFR Part 501). Also underconsideration is a record retention requirement of 3 years. The Agencyis seeking public comment on the appropriate period of time treatment worksshould be required to retain the records for surface disposal sites. The reports ensure that owners or operators of surface disposal sites willcomply with the monitoring and verification requirements of the rule. Inaddition, owners or operators must certify that each surface disposal site:andbullet; Does not cause or contribute to the harm of threatened or endangeredspecies or their habitat, does not restrict the flow of a base flood, doesnot reduce the temporary water storage capacity of a flood plain, and doesnot present a hazard to human health, wildlife, or land or water resources;andbullet; Does not attract birds that present a hazard to aircraft if thesurface disposal site is located either within 3,048 meters (10,000 feet)of aircraft runways used by turbine-powered aircraft of 1,524 meters (5,000feet) of an aircraft runway used only by piston engine-powered aircraft;andbullet; Is designed to withstand stress created by the maximum recordedground level acceleration if the surface disposal site is located in aseismic zone; andbullet; Is located 60 meters or more from a fault that has had displacementin Holocene time; andbullet; Is located in areas that adequately support the structural componentsof the surface disposal site; and andbullet; Is located outside the perimeter of a wetland area. In addition, the owner or operator of each surface disposal site must report,at the same frequency specified for sewage sludge monitoring, the concentrationof the pollutants in sewage sludge, the level of pathogen reduction achieved,the vector attraction reduction approach used, the record of the methanegas concentration in any structure within the surface disposal site boundaryor at the property boundary, the volume of runoff treated and discharged,and the concentration of the pollutants in the runoff. <ITAG tagnum="84">Pathogen And Vector Attraction Reduction Requirements (Subpart F)</ITAG>Applicability And Scope (andSection;503.50) The pathogen reduction and vector attraction reduction requirements includedin Subpart F pertain to sewage sludge that is applied to agricultural andnon-agricultural land, distributed and marketed, or disposed of in monofillsor on surface disposal sites. Pathogenic organisms in wastewater and sludgeinclude bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminth ova and constitute oneclass of contaminants. These organisms can cause diseases, usually entericdiseases, through direct human contact with the organisms or through ingestionof an infected animal. Pathogen bacteria and viruses occur in sewage. Based on a literature review,Table IX-F.1 lists those pathogenic organisms that (1) are associated witha high incidence of disease, (2) are found in high concentrations in sewagesludge, (3) exhibit resistance to environmental stresses, (4) can be detectedwith available methods, and (5) exhibit low infectious doses. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>TABLE </T4>IX-F.1_<T4>Primary Pathogens In Sewage Sludge</T4><H1>Type</H1><H1>Organism</H1><H1>Disease</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Bacteria <D/><T3>Campylobacter jejuni</T3> <D>Gastroenteritis.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Escherichia coli </T3>(pathogenic strains) <D>Gastroenteritis.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Salmonella </T3>sp. <D>Gastroenteritis, Enteric fever.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Shigella </T3>sp. <D>Gastroenteritis.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Vibrio cholerae</T3> <D>Cholera.</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Viruses <D>Enteroviruses </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Poliovirus </D><P>Coxsackievirus </P><P>Echovirus </P><P>Hepatitis A virus </P><D>Gastroenteritis, meningitis, carditis central nervous system involvement,pneumonia infectious hepatitis.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Norwalk viruses </D><D>Gastroenteritis.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Norwalk-like viruses </D><D>Gastroenteritis.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Reovirus </D><D>Respiratory infections, gastroenteritis.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>Rotavirus </D><D>Gastroenteritis, infant diarrhea.</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Helminths <D/><T3>Necator americanus</T3> <D>Hookworm.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Taenia </T3>sp. <D>Taeniasis (tapeworm).</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Toxocara </T3>sp. <D>Visceral larva migrans.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Trichuris </T3>sp. <D>Ascariasis.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Hymenolepis nana</T3> <D>Taeniasis.</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Protozoans <D/><T3>Toxoplasma gondii</T3>. <D>Toxoplasmosis.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Balantidium coli</T3> <D>Balantidiasis.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Entamoeba histolyca</T3> <D>Amebic dysentery.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Gardia lambia</T3> <D>Giardiasis.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D/><T3>Cryptosporidium</T3> <D>Gastorenteritis.</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Fungi <D/><T3>Aspergillus fumigatus</T3> <D>Aspergillosis or respiratory infections.</D><F>Source: Technical Support Document: Pathogens and Vectors.

Because sludge volume is much smaller than wastewater volume,concentrations of pathogens on a volume basis are much higher in the sludgethan in the original wastewater. The increased pathogen content of sludgemakes it essential that the Agency require processing and other proceduresthat minimize exposure of humans and animals to infectious organisms insludge.Ideally, regulations designed to protect individuals from pathogenic organismsin sewage sludge take into consideration:andbullet; The densities of specific pathogens of major public health significancecontained in sewage sludge;andbullet; The ability of specific wastewater and sludge treatment processesto reduce the concentrations of these pathogens;andbullet; The survival or transport of pathogenic organisms in the environment;andandbullet; The risk to humans ingesting a specific number of these pathogens.However, research on the fate and pathogenicity of microorganisms in sewagesludge is still under development. Therefore, the Agency has traditionallyspecified technology-based standards (i.e., processes that significantlyreduce pathogens_PSRP_and processes that further reduce pathogens_PFRP).These treatment technologies are included in 40 CFR 257.3-6.The Agency is gathering additional information on the survival and transportof pathogenic organisms in the environment and on the specific number ofpathogenic organisms likely to cause an infection. This information willbe used to develop a series of equations to simulate the movement of pathogenicorganisms through the environment. These equations will be integrated intoa model similar to the other exposure assessment models discussed in PartIV of the preamble. The model will (1) start with levels of pathogenicorganisms usually seen in wastewater prior to treatment, (2) project thelevel of reduction attained by wastewater and sewage sludge treatment,and (3) calculate the movement, survival, and attenuation of the pathogenicorganisms in the environment, as well as the risk of human disease.In conjunction with the development of the model, the Agency is gatheringinformation on the infectious dose of pathogenic organisms (i.e., the minimumnumber of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, or helminths necessary to causean infectious dose in the host). In defining an infectious dose, the Agencywill use a process similar to the way in which it establishes RfDs fornon-carcinogenic pollutants. The numbers will likely be similar to an RfD(i.e., establishing a level such that the likelihood of developing an infectiouscase is very low). Once microbiological ``human health criteria'' are establishedfor pathogenic organisms, the Agency will incorporate this informationwith data on survivability, transport, and climatic effects into a modelto calculate the densities of pathogenic organisms in sewage sludge thatcan be applied to the land or disposed of in monofills or on surface disposalsites without infecting individuals.Because more data are available on bacteria, the Agency anticipates modelingbacteria first, followed by viruses, protozoa, and helminth ova. Once themodel and criteria are fully developed and have undergrone review by theAgency's Science Advisory Board, the Agency will publish the model and,if necessary, propose revisions in the Part 503 requirements.Until the Agency develops microbiological human health criteria that linkspecific numbers of pathogenic organisms to an infectious dose, the Agencyis basing today's proposal on the premise that pathogenic organisms mustbe below levels of detection or below specified levels of fecal coliformsand fecal streptococci/enterococci (indicator bacteria) to protect humanhealth and the environment. To attain this standard, treatment works mayuse treatment processes alone (Class A, such as composting), or a combinationof treatment processes and periods of time when access to and use of theland where sludge is applied are restricted to allow environmental exposure(sunlight and soil temperature) to kill the remaining pathogens (ClassB and Class C). Less stringent treatment standards (Class B and Class C)are combined with more rigorous restrictions on access to the land andon growing and harvesting food and feed crops on sludge-amended soils.The combination of treatment standards and access and use restrictionsshould ensure that the densities of the remaining pathogenic organismsare sufficiently attenuated that the risk of human disease is negligible.EPA is specifying reductions in pathogenic organisms and densities of indicatororganisms that must be attained, rather than continuing to specify technologiesthat must be used, because of the difficulties in equating new processesto the documented processes (i.e., PSRP or PFRP). Without performance standardscorresponding to a desired level of pathogen reduction or density of indicatororganisms, manufacturers had difficulty in demonstrating that their technologywas equivalent to the treatment process specified in 40 CFR 257.3-6. In1985, the Agency established a Pathogen Equivalency Committee to reviewand assist the Agency in assigning new technologies to either PSRP or PFRP.However without performance standards, the Agency believes manufacturersstill will encounter difficulties and be reluctant to invest in new technologies.Today's performance standards are based on well-operated wastewater andsewage sludge treatment processes (see Reference number 78). Any processmay be used for a particular class of pathogen reduction as long as theappropriate pathogenic organism reduction or density of indicator organismsis attained. Another reason that the Agency is revising the requirements in 40 CFR 257.3-6is to provide additional flexibility for small treatment works to meetthe requirements in the rule. The two technologies specified in 40 CFR257.3-6 (PSRP and PFRP) did not give sufficient flexibility to small treatmentplants with processes that are not equivalent to PSRP to meet the requirementsby increasing the access and use restrictions, rather than investing insignificantly more costly processes. Therefore, the Agency is adding athird class of pathogen reduction/indicator organism densities that iscombined with more rigorous access and use restrictions to provide additionalopportunities for small treatment works to attain the performance standard.The Agency is also revising the 40 CFR 256.3-6 requirements because ofthe growing concern about applying septage to the land. In 1979, when the40 CFR Part 257 requirements were published, septage was considered tohave been treated to a level equivalent to PSRP. Therefore, septage couldbe placed on the land as though it had been treated by PSRP. In today'sproposal, septage is defined as sewage sludge. Therefore, septage collectedand applied to the land or disposed of in monofills or on surface disposalsites would have to be monitored and meet the requirements for the appropriateclass of pathogen reduction in the same manner as would any other sewagesludge that is generated or treated. The Agency recognizes that this waymay require that septage haulers have their septage processed prior toapplying the septage to the land. However, the Agency is unsure about theextent and magnitude of any disruptions that today's approach may cause.Public comments are requested on the impact of the proposed rule on theuse and disposal of septage. The Agency also is revising the approach used in 40 CFR 257.3-6 to separatethe pathogen reduction/indicator organism density requirements from thevector attraction reduction requirements. The Agency is proposing (1) fiveways to demonstrate that vectors would no longer be attracted to sewagesludge or (2) that sewage sludge be injected below the surface of the land.Except for ensuring that the vector attraction reduction is concurrentwith or follows the Class A pathogen reduction processes (to preclude explosiveregrowth of the pathogens), the Agency sees no merit in linking a particularvector attraction reduction option to a particular pathogen reduction performancestandard. Specialized Definitions (andSection; 503.51)<ITAG tagnum="81">Aerobic Digestion</ITAG>Digestion by aerobic processes is commonly used to stablize sewage sludge.Typically there is no attempt to control temperature, so temperatures ordinarilyrange from 10 to 30 degrees Celsius, depending on the daily weather conditions.If energy is conserved (e.g., by minimizing air flow and covering the digester),temperatures can increase to the thermophilic range (50 to 60 degrees Celsius).Nominal residence times range from 10 to 40 days. Volatile solids reductions,which indicate a reduction in the ability of the sludge to create odorsand attract vectors, is increased by operating at higher temperatures andfor longer residence times. The three types of aerobic digestion processes are conventional semi-batchdigestion, conventional (mesophilic) continuous digestion, and autoheated(thermophilic) continuous digestion. In the semi-batch operation, solidsare pumped directly from the clarifier into the continually aerated digester.When the digester is full, aeration continues for an additional 2 to 3weeks. The conventional continuous operation closely resembles the activatedsludge process with a flow-through aerobic digester followed by a clarifier-thickener.Many conventional aerobic digesters are operated in the ambient temperatureranges. In the autoheated processes, sludge from the clarifiers is usuallythickened to provide a digester feed with greater than four percent solids.In these digesters, thermophilic conditions (50 to 60 degrees Celsius)result from the exothermal heat of substrate oxidation. <ITAG tagnum="81">Anaerobic Digestion</ITAG>Anaerobic digestion is the degradation of microbiological organic substancein the absence of oxygen. Primary or secondary sludge is digested in anair-tight reactor for varying periods of time depending on the temperature.The three basic types of anaerobic digestion are low-rate digestion, high-ratedigestion, and two-stage digestion. In low-rate digestion, the sludge isunmixed in the reactor and the processes of sludge thickening and liquidsolid separation are carried out simultaneously. In high-rate digestion,the sludge in the reactor is mixed and heated to speed up microbial processingof the sludge. High-rate reactors are operated at either mesophilic (30to 38 degrees Celsius) or thermophilic (50 to 60 degrees Celsius) temperatures.High-rate reactors have shorter detention times than do low-rate reactors(i.e., 30 to 60 days for low-rate digesters versus 10 to 20 days for high-ratedigesters). In the two-stage process, a high-rate digester is linked toa second digester, generally unmixed. The second digester primarily servesas a thickener. <ITAG tagnum="81">Density of Microorganisms</ITAG>The density of microorganisms per unit mass of volatile suspended solidsis the number of microorganisms divided by the mass of volatile suspendedsolids in the sewage sludge. The number of microorganisms may be colony-formingunits or most probable number of bacteria, plaque-forming units of viruses,or the actual number, by count, of either protozoan cysts or helminth ova.The Agency is defining the density of microorganisms in terms of volatilesuspended solids because these organisms are associated with volatile suspendedsolids (i.e., organic material) in the sewage sludge. The Agency invitescomment on this approach.<ITAG tagnum="81">Specific Oxygen Uptake Rate</ITAG>Specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) is the rate at which bacteria consumeoxygen in a liquid sewage sludge that has been treated in an aerobic process(i.e., mass of oxygen consumed per unit time, per unit mass of sewage sludgesolids). A high SOUR indicates there is a large and active bacteria massin the sewage sludge and the sewage sludge is likely to putrefy rapidly.A low SOUR indicates that the bacteria in the sewage sludge have consumedavailable food sources and the sewage sludge will not putrefy rapidly.The SOUR standard of 1 milligram of oxygen per hour, per gram of sewagesludge solids or less is used as one of the indicators that the treatmenthas met the vector attraction reduction requirements.The SOUR standard is only appropriate for sewage sludge or compost thathas undergone aerobic digestion and has a high proportion of aerobic bacteria.Therefore, untreated, limed, and anaerobically digested sewage sludge arenot eligible to use this standard.<ITAG tagnum="81">Volatile Suspended Solids</ITAG>Volatile suspended solids is that portion of the total solids in sewagesludge that is removed when the sewage sludge is burned at 550 degreesCelsius in the presence of excess air. Microbiological densities are measuredin terms of volatile suspended solids in the sewage sludge because thesemicrobes are associated with the volatile suspended fecal material.Pathogen Reduction Requirements (andSection; 503.52)Section 503.52 proposes three classes of pathogen reduction to achievethe objective of reducing pathogenic organisms below levels of detection.EPA developed the three classes or levels of pathogen reduction (i.e.,Class A, Class B, and Class C) to provide treatment works greater flexibilityin reducing the risk of infection and disease from pathogens than was allowedin 40 CFR 257.3-6. Treatment works may meet the pathogen reduction requirementby treating the sewage sludge to the Class A performance standard. Therequirement may also be met by treating the sewage sludge to a Class Bor a Class C performance standard and by placing time restrictions on publicaccess to the land where the sewage sludge is applied and placing timerestrictions on growing and harvesting crops and grazing animals on thatland. These access and use restrictions are not applicable to sewage sludgedisposed of in monofills or on surface disposal sites because crops arenot grown on monofills or surface disposal sites and because the accessrestrictions for these disposal practices are more stringent than the accessrestrictions for land application of sewage sludge.<ITAG tagnum="81">Class A</ITAG>Class A pathogen reduction is achieved by processing the sewage sludge.Generally, this will involve composting the sewage sludge or using otherprocesses that increase the temperature of the sewage sludge to 50 to 60degrees Celsius.To achieve Class A reduction, the pathogenic bacteria, viruses, protozoa,and helminth ova in the sewage sludge must be reduced to below detectablelimits. By requiring that bacteria, viruses (<T3>Salmonella</T3> sp.), protozoa, and helminth ova are all below levelsof detection, the Agency believes that these organisms will not infectindividuals or animals.The proposed methods to be used in measuring each of these organisms arepresented in andSection; 503.81(b) and discussed later in the preamble. Aspart of that discussion the Agency is inviting comments on the methods.An alternative requirement is presented in today's proposed rule for ClassA pathogen reduction because of the difficulty in demonstrating that allfour types of pathogens are below detectable limits. EPA is proposing thatwhen the temperature of sewage sludge is raised (53 degrees Celsius for5 days or 55 degrees Celsius for 3 days or 70 degrees Celsius for one-halfhour) and the density of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci (enterococci)per gram of volatile suspended solids are each equal to or less than 100,the Class A pathogenic reduction requirements are achieved.Fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci are benign organisms present infecal material. They are used as indicators of the presence of fecal material.If their densities are high, the risk of infectious levels of pathogenicorganisms is also high. Agency data indicate that when coliform densitiesin processed sludge are low (100 per gram of volatile suspended solidsor less), <T3>Salmonella </T3>are absent and when coliform densities are high, <T3>Salmonella </T3>are present (Reference number 78). Thermal processesare about as efficient in destroying pathogenic organisms as they are indestroying fecal indicators, but the fecal indicators are present in muchhigher densities. When the fecal indicators are reduced to very low values,the likelihood of pathogen survival is negligible. Research also showsthat thermal processes must raise the temperature of the sludge to 53 degreesCelsius or above to ensure the destruction of helminth ova (<T3>Ascaris</T3> sp.) (Reference number 78). Other processes may reducefecal indicator densities to low levels but may not reduce all of the pathogensin sewage sludge to acceptable levels. For example, ionizing radiationis more effective against bacteria than against viruses. For this reason,viruses may be present in the sewage sludge even though the fecal indicatorsare below the 100 gram level. Another example is chemical treatment ofsewage sludge. Chemical treatment may reduce pathogenic bacteria and viruses,but may not reduce helminth ova because the ova are protected by a shellthat may be impervious to chemicals. Therefore, measurement of fecal indicatorsmay be used only when thermal processes raise the temperature of the sludgefor the specified periods of time.The Agency invites comments on applying the fecal indicator alternativeonly to processes that raise the temperature of the sewage sludge to atleast 53 degrees Celsius and solicits data on the correlation of pathogensto fecal indicator organisms for other technologies. The Agency also requestscomments on both the use of indicator organisms to measure pathogen reductionand on the use of the density of 100 per gram of volatile suspended solidsvalue for fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci/enterococci. The ClassA pathogen reduction must be completed prior to or must be concurrent withthe processes that are used to meet the vector attraction reduction requirements(see andSection; 503.52(a)(3)). The objective of this requirement is neverto leave a sewage sludge that is required to meet Class A requirementsnearly devoid of vegetative bacteria unless there is something presentthat inhibits bacterial growth. The inhibiting factor may be dryness, presenceof certain chemicals, or presence of vegetative bacteria. If the ClassA process that reduces pathogens follows the process for reducing vectorattraction (for example, pasteurization after anaerobic digestion), vegetativebacteria are destroyed. Subsequent contamination by pathogenic bacteriacould result in explosive regrowth. If the situation were reversed, thepresence of nonpathogenic bacteria that caused the digestion and reducedthe value of the sludge as an energy source would severely limit potentialfor explosive regrowth. This does not apply to Class B and Class C pathogenreduction because competitive bacterial organisms that hinder regrowthare present in the sewage sludge.Since the Class A pathogen requirements reduce pathogenic organisms tolevels unlikely to cause an infectious dose, the Agency is not imposingrestrictions on access to or use of the land for any period of time. Accessis restricted for non-agricultural lands until a vegetative cover is established,but only to keep individuals from sitting in or tracking sewage sludgeoff the field. Sewage sludge that is distributed and marketed must meetClass A pathogen reduction requirements. It is optional for other methodsof use or disposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">Class B</ITAG>To reduce pathogenic organisms to safe levels, Class B pathogen reductionrequirements use a combination of treatment and time restrictions on accessto and use of land to which the sewage sludge is applied. The level ofpathogenic organism reduction or the density of indicator organisms isbased on well-operated treatment works that use primary settling, followedby activated sludge treatment and anaerobic digestion. For treatment worksto achieve the Class B pathogen reductions, they must either demonstratethat the treatment processes reduce the average density of pathogenic bacteriaand of viruses per unit mass of volatile suspended solids in the sludgetwo orders of magnitude lower than those densities in the incoming wastewateror demonstrate that the densities of each of the fecal indicator organismsis 6 log<T2>10</T2> or less.For example, if the influent to the treatment work shows that the averagedensity of pathogenic bacteria per unit mass of volatile suspended solidsis 1 million (10\6\) and that the average density of viruses per unit massof volatile suspended solids is 10,000 (10\4\), after treatment, the processedsludge must show pathogenic bacteria densities of 10,000 (10\4\) and virusdensities of 100 (10\2\) per unit mass of volatile suspended solids.No requirements for reduction in protozoan cysts or helminth eggs are specified.Protozoan cysts are believed to be greatly reduced in numbers by sludgeprocessing and even if they were not greatly reduced, their numbers arereduced through environmental exposure on land. Helminth eggs are not significantlyreduced by processing and their densities decline slowly in the environment.The long period when growing food crops with the harvested portion belowthe ground is not allowed (5 years or 18 months if no viable helminth ovaare found) and the 12-month period during which public access to the fieldsis restricted protect the public against possible ingestion of viable infectivehelminth eggs.The test data that the Agency has on the reductions in pathogenic organismsare based on relative log<T2>10</T2> reductions. The Agency found that absolute numbers varied significantlybetween facilities depending on the influent to the treatment work, themethod used to measure the pathogenic organisms, and the investigator conductingthe measurements. However, for fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci,the Agency does have data indicating that when treatment of the influentincludes a well-operated physical or biological process and these processesare combined with alkali additions, chlorine additions, or storage of thesewage sludge, the log density of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococcieach are 6.0 or less. Reductions in fecal indicators correlate well withreductions in pathogenic bacteria and viruses when a combination of processesis used to treat the influent and the sewage sludge. Current data alsoindicate that the logarithms of the densities of fecal coliforms and fecalstreptococci in the influent to the treatment works do not vary significantlyfor different wastewater. For these reasons, the Agency believes an absolutevalue for fecal indicators can be used to indicate that the Class B pathogenreduction has been achieved. The Agency invites comments on this alternativerequirement and on limiting the applicability of the requirement to theuse of certain technologies. The Agency also solicits data on the correlationof fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci to pathogenic bacteria and viruses.The access and use restrictions discussed later in this section of thepreamble also apply when this alternative requirement is achieved.EPA is proposing to state the standard in terms of the difference in logdensities between the influent wastewater and the processed sludge. TheAgency is using this approach to credit the wastewater treatment processesas part of the processes to reduce pathogenic organisms. The requirementsin 40 CFR 257.3-6 only recognized processing of the sludge. However, somewastewater treatment processes are more effective than others in reducingpathogenic densities. Therefore, since the overall objective is to reducethe level of pathogenic organisms in the final sludge, the Agency now believesthat treatment works using those wastewater treatment processes that aremore effective in reducing pathogenic organisms should be credited fordoing so.<ITAG tagnum="81">Access And Use Restrictions_Class B</ITAG>When the Class B treatment standards are met, some pathogenic bacteriaand viruses remain. In addition, if protozoa and helminth ova are in theinfluent, they are likely to be in the sewage sludge. Therefore, as partof the Class B pathogen reduction requirements, EPA is imposing accessand use restrictions to limit exposure to the sewage sludge and providetime for attenuation of the pathogenic organisms. The period of time EPAis proposing to limit access to and use of the land should be sufficientto minimize the risk of disease when individuals, plants, and animals comein contact with the sewage sludge.The use restrictions for Class B reduction apply to agricultural land wheresewage sludge is applied. The public access restrictions apply to bothagricultural and non-agricultural land. The access restrictions do notapply to monofills and surface disposal sites because the access restrictionsfor these disposal methods are more rigorous. The access restrictions formonofills and surface disposal sites are designed to preclude public exposureto potentially toxic pollutants in the sewage sludge.The first two Class B use restrictions are for food crops. Food crops thathave harvested parts above the ground touching the sludge-soil mixturecannot be grown for 18 months after application of the sewage sludge. Ifthe harvested parts are above the ground and do not touch the sewage sludge,there is no restriction on growing the crop. The 18-month period providestime for the sun's radiant energy and desiccation to inactivate helmintheggs that are the most resistant to environmental stress.Food crops with harvested parts below the ground cannot be grown for aperiod of 5 years unless a demonstration is made that there are no viablehelminth ova in the soil. Research results indicate that helminth ova survivein soils for as long as 4 years after application of the sewage sludgeto the land, even though their survival rate is expected to be low (Referencenumber 79). At least 18 months is sufficient, however, to allow time forthe inactivation of most of the helminth ova on the soil surface.The third requirement is that feed crops may not be harvested for a periodof 30 days after application of the sewage sludge. The restriction protectshumans and animals from contact with the harvested product. The 30-dayperiod allows wind action and rainfall to reduce the amount of sewage sludgethat adheres to the crops. Thirty States have a similar restriction.The fourth requirement restricts the grazing of animals on agriculturalland for 30 days after application of the sewage sludge. This preventsanimals from physically removing the sewage sludge from the fields wherethe sewage sludge was applied. The restriction also reduces the potentialfor infection of animals from bacterial diseases, such as salmonellosis,that can be transmitted to humans. Thirty days should provide sufficienttime for rain and wind to remove most of the sludge from the plants andfor the adverse environmental factors to cause pathogen die-off.The Class B access restriction further prevents access by the uninformedpublic to the land where the sewage sludge is applied for 12 consecutivemonths. Agricultural workers and personnel who apply the sewage sludgeto agricultural and non-agricultural land are exempt from the restriction.Twelve months is fully protective against viruses and bacteria and willprovide protection against helminths. The time restriction for public accessis less than the time restriction for growing crops because the risk ofinfection is less from walking or sitting on the land than it is from ingestingfood crops grown on the sludge-amended soil.The time periods that are in today's proposal are based on research resultsand on experience discussed in the ``Technical Support Document: Pathogens/Vectors''(Reference number 78). The Agency invites comments on these time periodsand on the types of activities that are restricted. <ITAG tagnum="81">Class C </ITAG>Class C pathogen reduction requirements and the densities of indicatororganisms are based on the performance of treatment works that have aerobictreatment processes with long detention times and no primary settling processes.The Class C reductions in pathogenic organisms or densities of fecal indicatororganisms are slightly less stringent than the Class B requirements. Therefore,the Class C access and use restrictions are more stringent than the ClassB restrictions. Class C pathogen reduction is achieved when processes reduce the densityof bacteria and animal viruses per unit of volatile suspended solids inthe sludge 1.5 orders of magnitude lower than those densities in the incomingwastewater. The Agency invites comment on the 1.5 logarithmic reductionfor Class C. Treatment works may also demonstrate that the density of fecal coliformsin sewage sludge does not exceed 6.3 log<T2>10</T2> or less per gram of volatile suspended solids and the densityof fecal streptococci (enterococci) in the sewage sludge does not exceed6.7 log<T2>10</T2> or less per gram of volatile suspended solids prior to disposal.The Agency also invites comments on these values.Access and Use Restrictions_Class CThe further reduction in pathogenic bacteria and animal viruses and thereduction in protozoa cyst and helminth ova for Class C pathogen reductionare achieved through the access and use restrictions. These restrictionsallow the protozoa and helminth ova to be reduced by natural processes.Crops, animals, and humans are protected by the access and use restrictionson the land where the sewage sludge is applied. The first two Class C use restrictions are the same as the first two ClassB use restrictions. They restrict growing food crops with harvested partsthat are above the ground and that touch the sludge-soil mixture for aperiod of 18 months. Restrictions are also placed on growing crops withharvested parts below the ground for a period of 5 years, unless a demonstrationis made to show that helminth ova are not present in the soil. If thatdemonstration is made, food crops with harvested parts below ground maybe grown after 18 months. The third and fourth requirements restrict the harvesting of feed cropsfor 60 days and the grazing of animals for 60 days. Both of these requirementsare 30 days longer than the Class B restriction. This additional time isbeing imposed because of the less stringent logarithmic reduction in pathogenicorganisms and the less stringent pathogenic densities for indicator organisms.The access restriction for Class C pathogen reduction restricts accessto all personnel, except for those applying the sewage sludge, for 12 months.The Class B access requirement only restricts access to the public for12 months. The Class C access requirement is more stringent because ofthe less stringent logarithmic reduction in pathogenic organisms for ClassC requirements. The Agency requests comment on this approach. Vector Attraction Reduction (andSection; 503.53) Vectors such as rodents, flies, and mosquitoes play an important role inthe spread of pathogenic diseases. To break that link, treatment worksare to eliminate the characteristics of sewage sludge that attract vectors.Untreated sewage sludge is a high energy food source that can nourish insectlarvae and provide food for vectors. Putrescible organic compounds, includingorganic amines such as putrescine and cadaverine and short-chained fattyacids such as butyric acid, give off odors that attract vectors. The characteristicsof sewage sludge that attract vectors can be reduced or eliminated by compostingor digesting the sewage sludge, by raising the pH of the sewage sludge,by reducing the moisture content of the sewage sludge, or by injectingthe sewage sludge below the surface of the ground. EPA is proposing fiveindicators which show that the sewage sludge has been processed sufficientlyso as not to attract vectors. In lieu of meeting these indicators, ownersor operators of treatment works may inject the sewage sludge below thesurface of the ground to meet the vector attraction reduction requirements(unless the sewage sludge is distributed and marketed). When sewage sludgeis distributed and marketed, injection below the soil surface cannot beused to comply with the vector attraction reduction requirement becausethere is no control over the end user of the distributed and marketed product.In addition, sewage sludge is generally liquid when it is injected belowthe soil surface, but distributed and marketed sewage sludge is generallydried when it is either given away or sold. The vector attraction reduction requirements may be met by reducing thevolatile solids in the processed sewage sludge. The volatile solids ofthe processed sludge must be 38 percent lower than the volatile solidsin the influent. Experience over the last 9 years indicates that if thevolatile solids content of sewage sludge has been reduced by 38 percent,sewage sludge does not attract vectors (see Reference number 78). Volatilesolids reduction is calculated by a volatile solids balance of the digester.An alternative to the 38 percent volatile solids reduction is proposedbecause the Agency is aware of other measures that can be used to showa reduction in volatile solids. In many treatment plants, sewage sludgeis returned after treatment to the aerator for more treatment or to theinlet of the digester to improve the fluidity of the incoming sludge. Thesludge entering the digester has already been partially digested so itis extremely difficult to achieve an additional 38 percent volatile solidsreduction by digestion. Available data indicate that when digestion occursat mesophilic temperatures (30 to 38 degrees Celsius), the reduction invector attraction of the sewage sludge is achieved if less than a 15 percentvolatile solids reduction occurs in 40 additional days of batch digestion.The ``ability to digest further'' appears to be the best indicator of anindex of the potential for the sewage sludge to putrefy further. This approachwould not be a viable approach if an immediate evaluation of a sludge isrequired. The Agency invites comment on this approach. Another way vector attraction reduction can be achieved is to reduce SOURof the sewage sludge to 1 milligram of oxygen per hour, per gram of sewagesludge solids or less. This requirement only applies to sewage sludge treatedin aerobic processes. If a sludge has been treated aerobically to the pointwhere the biological organisms present are consuming very little oxygen,the value of the sludge as a food source for microorganisms is very lowand thus the sewage sludge does not putrefy or attract vectors. The Agencyalso invites comments on the use of SOUR to demonstrate vector attractionreduction of a sludge or a composted product and on the 1 milligram valuein today's proposal. Vector attraction reduction may also be met by adding alkali to raise thepH of the sewage sludge to 12 or above and, without the further additionof alkali, to remain at 12 or above for two hours and then to remain at11.5 or above for an additional 22 hours. When the pH of the sewage sludgeis raised to 12 or above, the bacterial activity is greatly diminished.When the pH of the sewage sludge drops below 10.5, bacterial regrowth fromspore-forming bacteria commences and the sewage sludge begins to putrefy.The requirement that no additional alkali be added after the initial incrementassures the presence of sufficient excess alkali to prevent pH from fallingbelow 10.5 for the several days needed to apply the sludge to the land.The pH values and time periods in the proposed rule are based on researchresults and experiences (Reference number 78). The Agency invites commentson the pH values and time periods and solicits data on alkali additionto sewage sludge and the time the pH of a sewage sludge has to be maintainedat a certain pH value. Another way to achieve vector attraction reduction is to dry the sewagesludge to achieve a 75 percent solids content of the sludge. Dry sewagesludge greatly diminishes the bacterial activity and, therefore, will notproduce odors and will not putrefy. The 75 percent solids value must becomplied with prior to mixing the sewage sludge with other materials. TheAgency invites comments on the 75 percent solids requirement and solicitsdata on the reduction of vegetative bacteria in sewage sludge that hasa lower percent solids content. While the Agency believes that the 75-percentvalue is adequate, data on a wide variety of sludge are solicited, particularlyon the potential spontaneous combustion of sewage sludge with a solidscontent between 60 and 80 percent. The final way vector attraction reduction can be achieved is to injectthe sewage sludge below the soil surface. The ground absorbs the moisturein the sewage sludge and that, combined with the cover over the sewagesludge, reduces the vector attraction of the sewage sludge. When the vector attraction reduction for a Class A sewage sludge is achievedby injection below the soil surface, there is a concern that bacterialregrowth may occur in the sewage sludge-soil mixture. Good management practicescould reduce, but hardly eliminated, all sources of contamination. Researchresults and experience indicate that if the fecal coliforms and fecal streptococciof the sewage sludge do not exceed 1000 (3 log<T2>10</T2>) per gram of volatile suspended solids at the time the sewagesludge is injected, it is likely that any bacteria introduced by contaminationof the sewage sludge would have grown to densities that could threatenhuman health (Reference number 78). For this reason, andSection; 503.52(a)(4)requires that if the sewage meets Class A pathogen reduction requirementsand is to be injected below the soil surface for vector attraction reduction,owners and operations would have to monitor the densities of fecal coliformsand fecal streptococci to ensure that the densities do not exceed 1000(3 log<T2>10</T2>) per gram of volatile suspended solids at the time of injection.As an alternative, the Agency considered specifying that the sewage sludgewould have to be injected into the ground within a specified period oftime after processing. However, without knowing the specific circumstancesunder which the sewage sludge would be handled or distributed, EPA couldnot discern an appropriate length of time between processing and injection.Therefore, the Agency felt that it was more reasonable to look for evidenceof regrowth. Public comment is requested on the proposal to monitor thesludge prior to injection and the alternative of specifying a period oftime within which injection would have to occur. Sampling Protocols And Analytical Methods (andSection; 503.81)Sections 503.81(b) (3) through (11) lists the proposed protocols for samplingand analyzing sewage sludge for pathogenic organisms, fecal indicator organisms,volatile solids, volatile suspended solids, percent volatile solids reduction,and SOUR. The Agency is interested in other methods that should be considered,particularly for pathogenic organisms because standard methods are availableonly for a few microorganisms.Although many of the microbiological methods were originally developedfor water, with proper sample processing, they are also applicable to sewagesludge. Part 908 of ``Standard Methods for the Examination of Water andWastewater'' (16th edition, 1985) discusses the handling of mud, sediments,and sludge.In addition to Part 917 ``Standard Methods for the Examination of Waterand Wastewater'' for measuring the density of protozoa and helminth ova,EPA is proposing the use of Fox, J., P. R. Fitzgerald, and C. Lue-Hing,``Sewage Organisms: A Color Atlas''. This book presents and discusses severaltypes of media, as well as techniques for measuring protozoa and helminthova. Neither technique is a standard method. However, the methods presentedin the book, although not subjected to rigorous statistical analyticalcomparisons, were developed for, and were extensively tested on, sludgeand soils. Some of the methods are appropriate for particular types ofhelminth ova and some are not. Before selecting a method, the Agency notesthat the introductory materials must be carefully reviewed to assure theappropriate method is used.<ITAG tagnum="84">Incineration (Subpart G)</ITAG>Applicability (andSection; 503.60)The requirements in Subpart G will apply to those facilities that firewaste streams consisting only of sewage sludge. As previously discussed,this excludes four facilities that currently fire waste streams consistingof between three and nine percent sewage sludge, on a dry weight basis.The standards proposed in Subpart G do not apply to sewage sludge incineratorsthat fire sewage sludge containing 50 ppm or more of PCBs, on a dry weightbasis. Owners or operators whose incinerators fire sewage sludge containing50 ppm or more of PCBs, on a dry weight basis, must comply with the requirementsin 40 CFR 761.70. In addition, owners or operators of facilities firingsewage sludge that has been determined to be hazardous must comply withthe requirements in 40 CFR 264.34.Specialized Definitions (andSection; 503.61)<ITAG tagnum="81">Air Pollution Control System</ITAG>Air pollution control systems include one or more processes used to treatthe air emissions from a sewage sludge incinerator. These systems use avariety of wet and dry devices. For example, sewage sludge incineratorseither are or could be fitted with wet and dry cyclones, low and high pressuredrop venturi scrubbers, scrubbing towers, impingement scrubbers, wet anddry electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), and fabric filters. Incineratorsmay also be fitted with after-burners, dry lime scrubbers, and lime spraydryers.<ITAG tagnum="81">Control Efficiency</ITAG>Control efficiency refers to the effectiveness of an incinerator and itsair pollution control system in preventing the release of metal to theatmosphere.

In Table 10 of the proposed rule, EPA lists the control efficienciesto be used in calculating numeric limits for arsenic, beryllium, cadmium,chromium, lead, mercury, and nickel. Except for beryllium and mercury,the metal control efficiencies listed in Table 10 represent the lowesttenth percentile metal control efficiencies of sewage sludge incineratorsin EPA's data base. The metal control efficiencies for beryllium and mercuryare based on the assumptions used in developing the National Emission Standardsfor Hazardous Pollutants (NESHAPs) for these pollutants. For other metals,EPA's data base includes information reported in the literature from 1972to 1985 and data from four incinerator tests conducted by the Agency in1987. Table IX-G.1 summarizes EPA's sewage sludge metal emission data baseand lists the 10th-percentile control efficiency on which the Agency setthe values in Table 10.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>IX-G.1_<T4>Summary of Control Efficiency Data for Metals</T4><H1>Contaminant </H1><H1>Number of incinerators tested</H1><H1>Minimum</H1><H1>Mean </H1><H1>Maximum </H1><H1>10th percentile </H1><H1>Regulatory value</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>7 </D><D>93.90 </D><D>98.62 </D><D>100.00 </D><D>95.52 </D><D>96 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>24 </D><D>40.25 </D><D>88.54 </D><D>99.98 </D><D>65.15 </D><D>65 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>23 </D><D>88.92 </D><D>99.16 </D><D>100.00 </D><D>96.12 </D><D>96 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>24 </D><D>34.22 </D><D>92.24 </D><D>99.67 </D><D>66.73 </D><D>67 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>19 </D><D>89.15 </D><D>98.68 </D><D>100.00 </D><D>95.00 </D><D>95</D></ITAG></ITAG>The owner or operator of a facility may use either the control efficiencieslisted in Table 10 or may conduct a performance test of the facility tocalculate the efficiency with which the incinerators and air pollutioncontrol systems control the emissions of one or more of the metals listedin this proposal. The emission control tests are to be conducted in accordancewith EPA guidance. EPA is developing guidance for emission control testsspecific to sewage sludge incinerators. This guidance will be availablefor public review and comment prior to the promulgation of the rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Dispersion Factor  </ITAG>A dispersion factor is a derived numerical value that relates the maximumallowable emission rate of a pollutant from a sewage sludge incineratorstack to a maximum allowable increase in the ground level ambient air concentrationfor that pollutant at a specified distance from the incinerator. EPA developedthe dispersion factors in Table 9 of the proposed rule using the ISCLTair model. The dispersion factors were developed using a number of conservativefactors including the meteorology of Atlanta, Georgia, and low gas exittemperatures (38 degrees Celsius, 100 degrees Fahrenheit). The ISCLT modelaccounts for significant atmospheric downwash from short incinerator stacks.A full discussion of the derivation of the dispersion factors is includedin the ``Technical Support Document for Incineration'' (Reference number56).  The owner or operator would use the appropriate dispersion factor basedon the height of the facility's stacks. The rule also provides that ownersand operators may calculate a dispersion factor on a case-by-case basisfor their facilities using the ``Guidelines on Air Quality Models'' (Referencenumber 44). <ITAG tagnum="81">Maximum Combustion Temperature  </ITAG>The maximum combustion temperature occurs in the combustion zone of thesewage sludge incinerator. In multiple hearth and electric incinerators,the combustion zone is in the middle hearths. In a fluidized bed incinerator,the maximum combustion temperature usually occurs in the free board spaceabove the fluidized bed. The proposal specifies that for incinerators nottested for case-by-case metal control efficiencies, the maximum combustiontemperature must not exceed 898 degrees Celsius, 1650 degrees Fahrenheitto avoid excessive metal emissions. For incinerators which are tested forcase-by-case metal control efficiencies, the maximum combustion temperaturewill be based on the results of the test. <ITAG tagnum="81">Risk Specific Concentration  </ITAG>The risk specific concentration is the maximum allowable annual incrementalincrease that may occur in the ground level ambient air for a pollutantwhen sewage sludge is incinerated. This concentration is the human healthcriterion upon which the numerical limit is based. The risk specific concentrationsare derived from the cancer inhalation potency values. Risk specific concentrationsare listed in Table 8 of the proposed rule.  No risk specific concentrations were developed for mercury or berylliumbecause the numerical limits for these pollutants are based on their NESHAPs.Therefore, the NESHAP values, expressed as an emission rate (grams per24 hours) are used to develop numerical limits for mercury and beryllium.Equations are provided in the rule to convert the NESHAP emission rateto a pollutant concentration that would be incorporated into a facility'spermit. Similarly, the numerical limit for lead is based on the NationalAmbient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) value and equations are used to convertthe NAAQS value to a pollutant concentration.  The Agency derived the risk specific concentrations (RSC) using the cancerpotency values (Q<T2>1</T2>*) with the following equation:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,4,2,14</C> <H1>RSC</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>RL</H1>andmultiply;BWandmultiply;1,000<H2>Q</H2><T2>1</T2>*andmultiply;I<T2>a</T2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">RSC=Risk specific concentration, in micrograms per cublic meter. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">RL=Risk level expressed as a negative exponent of 10. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">BW=Body weight, in kilograms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1,000=Factor to convert milligrams to micrograms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Q<T2>1</T2>*=Cancer potency expressed as milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight per day^1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">I<T2>a</T2>=Inhalation rate expressed in cubic meters per day.</ITAG>In establishing a risk specific concentration, EPA used the following valuesin the equation:<ITAG tagnum="26">RL=1andmultiply;10^5, or one chance in 100,000 of developing cancer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">BW=70 kilograms, which is the standard body weight of an adult male.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">I<T2>a</T2>=20 cubic meters, which is the standard inhalation rate of anadult male.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Q<T2>1</T2>*=Potency value for each pollutant.</ITAG>For example, the derivation of the risk specific concentration for arsenicis as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,12,2,33</C> <H1>RSC (Arsenic) </H1><H1>=</H1><H1>(1</H1>andmultiply;10^5andmultiply;(70 kg)andmultiply;(1,000)<H2>(15.0 [mg/kg/day]</H2>^1andmultiply;(20 m3/day)<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">RSC (Arsenic)=0.0023 andCx.18;g/m3</ITAG>In deriving the risk specific concentrations for chromium, and nickel,and in using the NAAQS for lead, EPA made critical assumptions that arediscussed below.1. <T3>Chromium. </T3>In deriving a risk specific concentration for chromium(0.085 andCx.18;g/m3), the Agency assumed that one percent of the total chromiumemission is in the form of hexavalent chromium (Cr+6). Chromium can beemitted in either the highly-carcinogenic, hexavalent state or in the relativelynon-toxic trivalent state (Cr+3). Trivalent chromium compounds have notbeen shown to be carcinogenic. Toxic levels of trivalent chromium are prevalentonly at concentrations higher than those normally found in sewage sludge. Hexavalent chromium, representing the more oxidized state of chromium,would be expected to be in the emissions when sewage sludge containingchromium compounds is incinerated. However, some investigators speculatethat most of the chromium is likely to be emitted in the trivalent statebecause the hexavalent state of chromium is highly reactive and is likelyto re-form into trivalent chromium.  Japanese laboratory and EPA-sponsored research, reported in the literature,have shown a correlation between the amount of hexavalent chromium formedin the ash from the incineration of sewage sludge and the degree of limetreatment of sludge before incineration. As the quantity of lime addedto the sludge was increased, the quantity of hexavalent chromium formationin the ash increased. The increased level of hexavalent chromium formationin the ash would likely be reflected in increased hexavalent chromium concentrationin air emissions (Reference numbers 23 and 12).EPA attempted to determine the ratio of hexavalent chromium to total chromiumin the emissions of sewage sludge incinerators. To date, only two sewagesludge incinerators have been tested successfully. The two results werequite variable, ranging from a level below the detection limits of hexavalentchromium (at 10 ppm Cr+6 to total chromium) to about 13 percent hexavalentchromium to total chromium (Reference numbers 47 and 39). In several instances the Agency encountered problems with the hexavalentstack testing method. Recovery problems have been encountered in the extractionprocedure used to remove the chromium from the collected particulate matter.It is suspected that certain organic and metal compounds emitted from combustionsources and present in the particulate catch could be reducing the hexavalentchromium to the trivalent form. This would result in a significant under-estimationof the actual hexavalent amount in the stack emissions. EPA is currently investigating procedures to improve the recovery of hexavalentchromium in stack emission tests. At this time, the Agency is close tocompletion of a new ion chromographic method for hexavalent chromium. Thisnew method is expected to be available for use in stack emission testingin 1989. Based on the limited hexavalent chromium data from actual emissions tests,EPA is proposing to assume that one percent of the total chromium emittedis hexavalent chromium. The Agency derived one percent by calculating thegeometric mean of the two results, 10 ppm and 13 percent. The geometricmean is 0.11 percent hexavalent chromium to total chromium. The mean valuewas then multiplied by a safety factor of 10 to derive the one percentassumption today's proposal. EPA plans further tests of sewage sludge incinerator emissions using improvedsampling and analysis methods for hexavalent chromium. These additionaltests should provide more insight into the ratio of hexavalent chromiumto total chromium in the emissions of sewage sludge incinerators. 2. <T3>Nickel. </T3>Nickel emissions present a problem similar to chromium.Nickel can potentially be emitted from combustion sources in several differentforms. Nickel subsulfide has been identified as the most carcinogenic formof nickel. Because EPA currently has no data on the chemical form of nickelemissions from sewage sludge incinerators, the Agency assumed that allnickel emitted is in the most carcinogenic form, nickel subsulfide. EPAhas initiated studies on the speciation of nickel emissions from combustionsources to evaluate their health effects. Until these studies demonstrateotherwise, the Agency believes the appropriate approach is to assume thatall nickel emitted is in the form of nickel subsulfide. EPA requests comments on the assumptions used in deriving the risk specificconcentrations for chromium and nickel. The Agency also requests submissionof data on the emissions of chromium and nickel from sewage sludge incineratorsas part of comments on today's proposal to assist in evaluating its proposal.3. <T3>Lead. </T3>EPA is proposing to limit lead emissions from sewage sludgeincinerators so that the ground level concentration of lead does not exceed25 percent of the NAAQS for lead. The NAAQS for lead is 1.5 microgramsper cubic meter maximum arithmetic mean averaged over a calendar quarter(see 40 CFR 50.12). In deriving a ground level concentration for lead, the Agency evaluatedthe following two alternatives: 10 percent of the NAAQS, the percent usedin the forthcoming proposed revisions to the Hazardous Waste Incineratorregulation; and 25 percent of the NAAQS. States allocate a percentage ofthe NAAQS to various sources of lead emissions in non-attainment areasthrough State Implementation Plans (SIPs). Up to now, States have not includedlimits for sewage sludge incinerators in their SIPs, leading the Agencyto believe that States do not consider sewage sludge incinerators to besignificant sources of lead emissions. EPA is soliciting comments on thisassumption. EPA is proposing to use 25 percent of the NAAQS as an initial step in regulatinglead from sewage sludge incinerators. Based on available information, limitinglead emissions from sewage sludge incinerators to 25 percent of the NAAQSensures that the increase in ground level ambient concentration of leadwould not exceed the current lead NAAQS.The Agency is soliciting comments on limiting emissions to 10 percent ofthe NAAQS. Ten percent would further limit lead exposure. The Agency'sgoal is to minimize lead exposure from all sources due to the significantbiological changes across a broad range of exposures to lead (down to verylow levels). Keeping the contribution of sewage sludge incinerators toambient air lead levels to 10 percent of the NAAQS level (i.e., 0.15 andCx.18;g/m3)would be consistent with this goal. Allowing sewage sludge incineratorsalone to contribute potentially up to 25 percent of the NAAQS may be excessivesince allowing that increment could allow ambient lead levels in some areasto rise substantially from the present average background level of 2.0andCx.18;g/m3. States may wish to further limit the emission of lead fromsewage sludge incinerators if it is warranted in non-attainment areas.The 1978 NAAQS for lead was designed to ensure that 99.5 percent of thepopulation has blood lead levels below 30 micrograms per deciliter (andCx.18;g/dl),the level then judged to provide an adequate margin of safety from adversehealth effects. The Agency now has data indicating that much lower bloodlead levels are associated with a variety of toxic effects in men, women,and, particularly, in the very young. EPA is currently reviewing the currentNAAQS for lead and will incorporate this new information. Until a new NAAQSis promulgated for lead, the current NAAQS will be the basis of the numericallimit when sewage sludge is incinerated. When EPA revises the current NAAQSof 1.5 andCx.18;g/m3, the Agency also will revise the numerical limit forlead from sewage sludge incineration. <ITAG tagnum="81">Sewage Sludge Feed Rate </ITAG>The feed rate is either the average amount of all the sewage sludge incineratedper day at the facility or the design capacity of the facility, takinginto account the total amount of sewage sludge that can be fired each dayby all the incinerators within the property line of the facility. ``TheTechnical Support Document for Incineration'' (Reference number 56) describeshow the sewage sludge feed rate is to be measured. The feed rate of a facility, in metric tons per day is used in calculatingthe pollutant limits (i.e., concentration of a metal in sewage sludge).The numerical limit must be calculated based on all sludge fired at a facility.Otherwise, it will not account for all the emission from the facility andmay not provide an adequate level of protection. <ITAG tagnum="81">Stack Height</ITAG>The stack height is the difference between the elevation of the top ofa sewage sludge incinerator stack and the elevation of the ground surfaceat the base, when the difference is equal to or less than 65 meters. Ownersor operators of incinerators with stacks higher than 65 meters must determinethe creditable stack height above 65 meters in accordance with ``good engineeringpractice'' (GEP) (see 40 CFR 51.100(ii)(1)(ii)). Creditable GEP stack heightmeans the greater of the following measurements: (1) 65 meters, measuredfrom the ground level elevation at the base of the stack; or (2) a calculatedmeasurement based on the height (and, possibly, width) of nearby structuresand a constant. The latter measurement is derived from the formula thatfollows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L0,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,s50</C> <H1>Hg=H+1.5L</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Hg=GEP stack height, measured from the ground level elevation at thebase of the stack, in meters.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H=Height of nearby structure(s), measured from the ground level elevationat the base of the stack, in meters.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">L=Lesser dimension, height or projected width, or nearby structure(s),in meters.</ITAG>The creditable GEP stack height was developed by the Agency to assure thatthe degree of emission limitations required for the control of any airpollutants under an applicable SIP is not affected by that portion of astack height exceeding GEP or by any other dispersion technique. Guidanceis available on how to calculate good engineering stack height (Referencenumber 42).<ITAG tagnum="81">Total Hydrocarbons</ITAG>Total hydrocarbons is the sum of all emitted organic compounds that haveone or more carbon-to-carbon bonds, one or more carbon-to-hydrogen bonds,and that may also have one or more carbon-to-chlorine, carbon-to-nitrogen,or carbon-to-oxygen bonds. For the purposes of today's proposal, totalhydrocarbons is defined as a pollutant for which the Agency is proposinglimits. The limits are expressed in terms of the concentration of totalhydrocarbons in the emissions. EPA is controlling hydrocarbon emissionsas a way of limiting the emission of organic pollutants present in thesludge fed into the incinerator and that are created during the incinerationprocess. This proposed approach is discussed further later in this subpartof the preamble.General Requirements (andSection; 503.62)<ITAG tagnum="81">Other Governing Regulations</ITAG>In addition to the requirements in Subpart G of the proposed rule, ownersand operators of sewage sludge incinerators must comply with existing requirementspromulgated under the authority of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Sewage sludgeincinerators are subject to both the beryllium NESHAP (40 CFR 61.30 through61.34) and the mercury NESHAP (40 CFR 61.50 through 61.55). Furthermore,the 47 facilities built or substantially modified after July 11, 1973,and any new sewage sludge incinerators that are built are subject to theNSPS for sewage sludge incinerators in 40 CFR 60.150 through 60.154.State Implementation Plans require the review of new sewage sludge incineratorsunder procedures for ``prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) ofair quality'' (see 40 CFR 51.21) and for ``new source review'' (see 40CFR 51.165). These procedures are designed to (1) prevent further air qualitydegradation in non-attainment areas because of particulates, ozone, nitrogenoxides, sulfur dioxide, lead, and carbon monoxide; (2) ensure that no significantdeterioration occurs in other areas; and (3) ensure compliance before apermit is issued to construct or modify an emission source. This reviewmay require a new sewage sludge incinerator to install the best availablecontrol technology economically achievable to control the criteria pollutantsto a level that will not cause any deterioration in air quality.<ITAG tagnum="81">Incinerator Ash</ITAG>Today's proposal does not include separate requirements for the disposalof ash from the incineration of sewage sludge. Rather, the Agency is referencingthe applicable requirements for the disposal of incineration ash from 40CFR Parts 257, 258, and 261 through 268.<ITAG tagnum="81">Feed Rate</ITAG>EPA is requiring the use of either the design capacity of the facilityor the feed rates of all sewage sludge incinerators within the propertyboundary of a facility in calculating the pollutant limits for a facility.As discussed above, this requirement is necessary to ensure that emissionsfrom the facility will not contain pollutant concentrations that pose anunreasonable risk to human health. For the purposes of this rule, an unreasonablerisk would be one in which the pollutant limits exceeded an incrementalcarcinogenic risk level of 1andmultiply;10^5. If the feed rate of all sewagesludge incinerated at a facility is not considered, the emissions fromthe facility could pose an incremental risk greater than 1andmultiply;10^5.<ITAG tagnum="81">Monitoring Instruments</ITAG>Owners and operators of sewage sludge incinerators must install, calibrate,operate, and maintain an instrument that measures the sludge feed ratesof an incinerator. The instrument must have an accuracy of plus or minusfive percent over its operating range, a standard generally used by theAgency. EPA is also proposing that owners and operators install, calibrate,operate, and maintain instruments that continuously monitor and recordthe oxygen content of the exit gas (before the gas is diluted by air),the temperature in the combustion zone of the incinerator, and the totalhydrocarbon concentration in the exit gases. The rationale for each ofthese requirements is discussed below.1. <T3>Feed Rates.</T3> The NSPS for sewage sludge incinerators require instrumentsfor monitoring sludge feed rate for all sewage sludge incinerators builtafter 1973. The effect of today's proposal is to require the owners oroperators of the 122 facilities that are not covered by the NSPS to installinstruments that continually monitor the feed rate of sewage sludge, ifthey have not already done so.The ability to monitor sludge feed rate continuously allows for more stableoperation of the incinerator and provides the operator with advanced knowledgeof a change in operating conditions. For example, a large increase in thesludge feed rate increases the drying load on the top hearths of a multiplehearth incinerator causing the combustion zone to drop to a lower hearth.This type of upset results in increased gas flow through the furnace andan increase in particulate emissions to the air pollution control system.A large decrease in the sludge feed rate will cause the combustion zoneto rise to a higher hearth. The higher combustion hearth location reducesthe overall residence time of the combustion gases in the incinerator andcan increase the emissions of unburned organic pollutants from the incinerator.Continuous monitoring of the sludge feed rate ensures that the furnaceis not fed sludge in excess of the unit's design capacity. If the designcapacity of the incinerator were exceeded, excessive emissions from theincinerator and incomplete combustion of organics and carbon could result.EPA is including a requirement for owners and operators to provide accessto the sewage sludge fed to the incinerator so that a well-mixed, representativegrab sample of the sewage sludge can be collected easily. The representativesample allows periodic verification to be made that the facility is incompliance with the metal limits in its permit.2. <T3>Oxygen In Combustion Gases.</T3> The Agency is proposing that ownersand operators of incinerators continuously monitor and record the amountof oxygen in combustion gases leaving the combustion zone to avoid excessoxygen levels in the combustion gases. Excessive oxygen causes unnecessarilyhigh gas velocities in the furnace. This phenomenon increases particulatematter in the gases, placing a greater load on the air pollution controlsystem. Overloading the air pollution control system reduces the efficiencyof the system to remove organic and metal pollutants attached to the particulates.3. <T3>Combustion Zone Temperatures. </T3>Owners and operators are also requiredto monitor and record the operating temperatures in the combustion zone.A proper operating temperature is the single most important control parameterof an incinerator. Temperatures that are too low result in incomplete combustionof organic pollutants. Temperatures that are too high result in excessivemetal emissions. For multiple hearth furnaces, EPA is proposing that every hearth have atemperature-measuring device (thermocouple) and that the burning hearthhave two measuring devices. The requirement for two devices in the burninghearth is to provide redundancy in the case of the failure of one device.The high temperature of the burning hearth increases the rate of failureof the thermocouples. In addition, the burning hearth temperature is themost critical temperature in the furnace and requires the most controlto minimize emissions. This requirement is consistent with the revisedNSPS for sewage sludge incinerators (40 CFR 60.153(b) (3)).For fluidized bed furnaces, the Agency is proposing two temperature measuringdevices: one in the bed and one in the outlet duct of the fluidized bed.For electric furnaces and rotary kilns, the Agency is proposing one temperaturemeasuring device in the drying zone and two in the combustion zone. Theserequirements are consistent with the revised NSPS for sludge incinerators(40 CFR 60.153(b)(3)).4. <T3>Total Hydrocarbons In Emission Gases. </T3>The Agency is proposingthat owners and operators continuously monitor and record the total hydrocarbonconcentration in the emission gases of sewage sludge incinerators. As discussedlater in this subpart of the preamble, EPA is proposing to limit the concentrationof total hydrocarbons in the emissions in lieu of specifying the concentrationof an organic pollutant that may be fed into the incincerator. Total hydrocarbon emissions are to be measured with a flame ionizationdetector. The detector is a hydrogen-oxygen flame into which a small sampleof the exhaust gases from an incinerator is introduced. If there are anyhydrocarbon gases present in the sample, they will burn in the hydrogen-oxygenflame. When any carbon-to-carbon or carbon-to-hydrogen bonds are brokenand oxidized in the flame, an ion is released. An electrical detectionsystem senses the release of the ion. The electrical signal strength isa direct measure of the number of carbon-to-carbon and carbon-to-hydrogenbonds that are oxidized in the flame. The direct readout of this signalis calibrated to indicate the concentration of hydrocarbons in the samplestream by use of a series of calibration gases of known hydrocarbon concentrationwhich are periodically introduced into the sample stream. The flame ionizationdetection system is described by Method 25A in Appendix A of 40 CFR Part60. The Agency is requiring that a flame ionization detector include a 150degrees Celsius heated sample line and inlet system for measuring totalorganic emissions. The 150 degree heated sample line keeps the semi-volatilesin the gas sample in the vapor phase and prevents their reduction in thesample transportation and conditioning system. EPA estimates that, withoutthe heated sample line, only 50 to 60 percent of the total hydrocarbonswould be detected by the flame inonization detector. With the heated sampleline, at least 75 percent of the total hydrocarbons present in the exitgases can be detected. This reading is then multiplied by a correctionfactor and adjusted to 7-percent oxygen to obtain the true concentrationof total hydrocarbons. Further discussion of the flame ionization detectorsystem is in the ``Technical Support Document for the Incineration of SewageSludge'' (Reference number 56). <T3>Incineration_National Pollutant Limits (andSection; 503.63)</T3>As described in Part III of the preamble, the Agency initially evaluated34 pollutants. With simple models using the worst combination of conditions,the Agency found that the following pollutants did not pose an unreasonablerisk to human health in the concentrations shown in the ``40 Cities Study'':copper, selenium, and zinc. These pollutants are among the pollutants listedin Subpart H of the proposed rule that are eligible for removal creditswhen sewage sludge is incinerated. <ITAG tagnum="81">Equations</ITAG>EPA is proposing to use one equation for beryllium, a second equation formercury, a third equation for lead, and a fourth equation for arsenic,cadmium, chromium, and nickel to calculate the allowable concentrationof these pollutants in sewage sludge that may be incinerated. A fifth equationis used to calculate an acceptable concentration of total hydrocarbonsin the combustion gases exiting the incinerator. The Agency found that it could not establish a specific concentration foreach pollutant in the sludge or a specific concentration for total hydrocarbonsin the emissions that would be applicable to all facilities. Key variablescould make a significant difference in the allowable pollutant concentration.Such variables include the physical characteristics of the facility (e.g.,feed rate of the facility, stack height, control efficiency of the incineratorand air pollution control system), and the terrain and meteorology wherethe facility is located. 1. <T3>Beryllium. </T3>The equation for beryllium is: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,2,2,13</C> <H1>C</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>10</H1><H2>(1^CE) </H2>andmultiply; SF<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C=Maximum allowable concentration of beryllium in sewage sludge, inmilligrams per kilogram (dry weight basis).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CE=Sewage sludge incinerator control efficiency (from Table 1 in theproposed rule).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SF=Sewage sludge feed rate, in metric tons per day (dry weight basis).</ITAG>This equation is used to calculate the maximum allowable concentrationof beryllium in sewage sludge that may be incinerated at a facility withoutexceeding the beryllium NESHAP emission of 10 grams over a 24-hour period(see 40 CFR 61.32).The owner or operator provides the permitting authority with the designcapacity of the facility (i.e., the combined feed rate of all the incineratorsat a facility) to insert into the equation. The NESHAP emission limitsare developed with a numerical value that relates a level of emission toa ground level concentration that will not cause undue risk to an individualexposed to the maximum pollutant concentration in the plume. Thus, theAgency did not include a dispersion factor in the equations for berylliumor mercury.The Agency assumed a 0.99 control efficiency to convert the beryllium NESHAPemission limit to an allowable concentration in sludge. This control efficiency,the result of the test, is the only data available to the Agency becauseberyllium is not generally found in incinerated sewage sludge and therefore,analyses have not been conducted for beryllium. If owners or operatorsdemonstrate a greater or lesser control efficiency for beryllium in a performancetest of the facility, the actual control efficiency demonstrated will beinserted into the equation. The Agency is seeking data that demonstratesthe efficiency with which sewage sludge incinerators and air pollutioncontrol devices control the emission of beryllium.Using the equation with the sludge feed rate of the facility and 0.99 controlefficiency, the permitting authority calculates the maximum allowable berylliumconcentration. This concentration is compared with the concentration ofberyllium found in the sludge to be incinerated at the facility. Sludgethat exceeds the maximum allowable concentration may not be incinerated.2. <T3>Mercury. </T3>The equation for mercury is:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,2,2,14</C> <H1>C</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>3200</H1><H2>(1- CE) andmultiply; SF</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C=Maximum allowable concentration of mercury in sewage sludge, inmilligrams per kilogram (dry weight basis).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CE=Sewage sludge incinerator control efficiency (from Table 10 inthe proposed rule).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SF=Sewage sludge feed rate, in metric tons per day (dry weight basis).</ITAG>This equation is used to calculate the maximum allowable concentrationof mercury in sewage sludge that may be incinerated at a facility withoutexeeding the mercury NESHAP emission limit of 3,200 grams per 24-hour period(see 40 CFR 61.52).As in the previous equation, the owner or operator provides the permittingauthority with the design capacity of the facility or the combined sewagesludge feed rates of all the incinerators at the facility. The permittingauthority then inserts this facility-specific feed rate into the equation.The permitting authority inserts a zero into the equation for the mercurycontrol efficiency. A zero control efficiency is included in the proposalbecause, in developing the NESHAP for mercury, the Agency assumed a zerocontrol efficiency. If owners or operators can demonstrate a greater levelof control based on a performance test, the permitting authority will usethe control efficiency demonstrated in the performance test. Using thesewage sludge feed rate of a facility and either a zero control efficiencyor a control efficiency demonstrated in a performance test, the permittingauthority calculates the maximum allowable mercury concentration in sewagesludge that may be incinerated at a facility. This maximum allowable concentrationof mercury is then compared with the concentration of mercury found inthe sewage sludge incinerated at the facility. If the facility's sludgeexceeds the allowable concentration, the owner or operator may not incineratethe sludge containing the excessive concentrations of mercury.3. <T3>Lead.</T3> The equation for lead is:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,2,2,25</C> <H1>C</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>.25(NAAQS) andmultiply; 86,400</H1><H2>DF andmultiply; (1- CE) andmultiply; SF</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C=Maximum allowable concentration in sewage sludge, in milligramsper kilogram (dry weight basis).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">NAAQS=National Ambient Air Quality Standard for lead (1.5 microgramsper cubic meter maximum arithmetic mean averaged over a calendar quarter).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">86,400=Number of seconds in a day.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">DF=Dispersion factor, in micrograms per cubic meter per gram per second(from Table 9 in the proposed rule).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CE=Sewage sludge incinerator control efficiency (from Table 10 inthe proposed rule).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SF=Sewage sludge feed rate, in metric tons per day (dry weight basis).</ITAG>To insert a value for the dispersion factor, the owner or operator selectsthe dispersion factor corresponding to the stack height of the incineratorsat the facility from Table 9 of the proposed rule, if the height of theincinerator stack is 65 meters or less. If the stack exceeds 65 meters,the creditable stack height above 65 meters is determined in accordancewith 40 CFR 51.100(ii)(1)(ii). The results of this calculation would beused in the EPA-approved air dispersion model, such as the ISCLT (appropriatefor the facility's surrounding terrain and meteorology), to calculate adispersion factor for the equation. Owners or operators whose incineratorshave stacks less than 65 meters also may conduct their own air dispersionmodeling at the facility to establish a facility-specific dispersion factorin accordance with EPA's ``Guidelines on Air Quality Models'' (Referencenumber 44). The control efficiency for lead is listed in Table 10 of the proposed rule.The owner or operator may conduct performance tests of the facility, inaccordance with the requirements specified by EPA, to demonstrate an alternativecontrol efficiency. If a performance test is conducted, the actual controlefficiency demonstrated will be included in the equation. As in the previous equations, the owner or operator provides the permittingauthority with information on the design capacity of the facility or thecombined sewage sludge feed rates of all the incinerators at the facility.Using the above information, the permitting authority would calculate afacility-specific numerical limit for lead. This calculation is then comparedto the concentration of lead found in the sewage sludge to be incineratedat the facility. 4. <T3>Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, And Nickel</T3>. The equation for arsenic,cadmium, chromium, and nickel is: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,2,2,20 </C>  <H1>C</H1><T2>i</T2> <H1>= </H1><H1>RSC</H1><T2>i</T2>andmultiply;86,400 <H2>DFandmultiply;(1^Ce</H2><T2>i</T2>)andmultiply;SF  <ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C<T2>i</T2>=Maximum allowable concentration of metal pollutant in sewagesludge, in milligrams per kilogram (dry weight basis). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">RSC<T2>i</T2>=Risk specific concentration for the metal in sewage sludge,in micrograms per cubic meter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">86,400=The number of seconds in a day. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">DF=Dispersion factor, in micrograms per cubic meter per gram per second(from Table 9 in the proposed rule). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CE<T2>i</T2>=Sewage sludge incinerator control efficiency (from Table 10in the proposed rule).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SF=Sewage sludge feed rate, in metric tons per day (dry weight basis).</ITAG>The permitting authority would select the appropriate risk specific concentrationfrom Table 8 in the proposed rule. As discussed earlier, the risk specificconcentrations are derived from EPA's cancer potency values (Q<T2>1</T2>*). The owner or operator would then follow the same processas described above for lead. 5. <T3>Total Hydrocarbons.</T3> EPA is proposing to limit the concentrationof total hydrocarbons in the emissions of incinerators for two reasons.First, this approach controls the emission of individual organic compoundsfound in sludge fed into the incinerator, and second, the approach controlsthe emission of organic compounds that are created during the combustionprocess (i.e., products of incomplete combustion_PICs). The Agency recognizesthat setting limits on total hydrocarbons is an innovative approach thatmay be applicable to other incinerator programs. Therefore, the Agencywill carefully review and consider the issues raised and the comments submittedon this approach. (a) <T3>Human Health Criterion For Organic Components of Total Hydrocarbons.</T3>To develop a risk specific concentration for total hydrocarbons, the Agencydeveloped a weighted carcinogenic potency (Q<T2>1</T2>*) value for the organic compounds that are projected to be inthe emissions of a sewage sludge incinerator. In developing the Q<T2>1</T2>* value, the Agency multiplied the Q<T2>1</T2>* value of every carcinogenic organic pollutant listed in IRISby the weighted fraction of the compound in the emissions of sewage sludgeincinerators. Calculating a weighted fraction of a compound in the emissionsrequired a two-step process. First, the Agency determined the concentration(in andCx.18;g/m3) for the pollutant in the emissions in one of three ways.If the compound was measured in the emission of the sludge incinerator,the concentration of the compound was used. In the case of compounds expectedto be present, but not detected, the observed detection limit (andCx.18;g/m3)was used. Finally, for the remaining pollutants listed in IRIS and detectedin emissions from other sources, an analytical detection limit of 0.1 andCx.18;g/m3was assigned to those pollutants. The Agency then calculated a weightedfraction for each pollutant by dividing the sum of all the pollutant concentrationsinto each individual pollutant concentration. EPA multiplied the weightedfraction of each pollutant by the pollutant's Q<T2>1</T2>* value and then added the products of the multiplication togive a weighted carcinogenic potency value for all carcinogenic pollutantsdetected or not detected. Weighted fractions were also calculated for all non-carcinogens that haveRfDs in IRIS. However, the Agency assumed that the actual ambient air concentrationof the non-carcinogens (i.e., threshold pollutants) would not exceed theirinhalation RfDs and, therefore, do not contribute to the weighted Q<T2>1</T2>* value or cause adverse health effects. The Agency is seeking comments on its determination that the expected concentrationof non-carcinogens would not be associated with adverse health effects.The weighted average Q<T2>1</T2>* value for total hydrocarbons is 0.013 (mg/kg/day). All thedata and calculations used in developing the weighted Q<T2>1</T2>* value are in Appendix E of the ``Technical Support Document:Incineration of Sewage Sludge'' (Reference number 56). The Agency is solicitingcomments on the approach used. From the weighted Q<T2>1</T2>* value, the Agency developed a risk specific concentration fortotal hydrocarbons using the same equation that was used to develop therisk specific concentrations for metals. The risk specific concentrationfor total hydrocarbons was derived as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,4,2,16 </C>  <H1>RSC </H1><H1>= </H1><H1>RLandmultiply;BWandmultiply;1,000 </H1><H2>Q</H2><T2>1</T2>*andmultiply;Ia  <ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="20">Where: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">RSC=Risk specific concentration of total hydrocarbons, in microgramsper cubic meter. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">RL=Risk level of 1andmultiply;10^5. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">BW=Body weight of 70 kilograms. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Q<T2>1</T2>*=Weighted average Q<T2>1</T2>* value of 0.013 for all carcinogens with Q<T2>1</T2>* values in IRIS and all non-carcinogen (threshold) pollutantsin IRIS, in (mg/kg/day) ^1. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Ia=Inhalation rate of 20, in cubic meters per day. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1,000=Factor to convert milligrams to micrograms. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Therefore:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,6,2,24,4,2,10</C> <H1>RSC</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>(1</H1>andmultiply;10^5) andmultiply; (70 kg) andmultiply; 1,000<H2>(0.013) </H2>andmultiply; 20 m3/day<H1>or</H1><H1>= </H1><H1>2.69 andCx.18;g/m</H1>3<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>The risk specific concentration is extremely sensitive to the analyticallimits of detection selected for individual carcinogenic organic compoundsnot detected in emissions tests of sewage sludge incinerators. A relativelyhigh analytical detection limit will generate a high risk and a low detectionlimit will generate a lower risk. This is particularly true for dioxins,PCBs, and aldrin/dieldrin.The risk specific concentration is then used to develop a numerical limitfor the concentration of total hydrocarbons in the emissions.(b) <T3>Measuring Total Hydrocarbons. </T3>The instrument used to monitor totalhydrocarbons is a flame ionization detector. Questions have been raisedabout the capability of a flame ionization detector to monitor continuouslythe total hydrocarbons emissions from an incinerator. Moreover, there isuncertainly about the relationship of the reading of the flame inonizationdetector to the risk specific concentration that will protect individualsto an incremental carcinogenic risk of 1andmultiply;10^5.Introduced in the mid-1960's, flame ionization detectors have a numberof applications, such as detection systems in gas chromatographs locatedin laboratories around the world. Their wide use in the analysis of organiccompounds has resulted in a substantial body of literature on using thedetector to monitor total hydrocarbons. However, there are problems withthe system as a regulatory compliance method.First, organic compounds with very high boiling points tend to condensein the sampling line between the stack and the detector system, escapingdetection. As a result, the detector system does not accurately measurethese high-boiling compounds. Most of this problem can be overcome by theuse of a heated sampling system operated at 150 degrees Celsius. Moreover,a correction factor has been applied in EPA's equation for calculatingthe total hydrocarbon limit to account for the loss of the high-boilingorganic compounds. A second problem with the flame ionization detector system is the differingresponse of the detector to different compounds incinerated. The detectorsystem primarily measures the oxidation of carbon-to-carbon and carbon-to-hydrogenbonds. Organic compounds with differing numbers of these bonds will givedifferent responses. Fortunately the relative response of a large numberof the organic compounds are known. The Agency is calculating a weightedaverage response factor for the flame ionization detector analogous toour weighted Q<T2>1</T2>* calculation for the risk specific concentration. This weightedaverage response factor is incorporated into the conversion factors inthe equation used to calculate a numerical limit for total hydrocarbonsthereby relating the reading of the device to an incremental carcinogenicrisk level of 1andmultiply;10^5. EPA has initiated tests to verify the long-term reliability of the detectors.The equipment requires routine maintenance and daily calibration, whichare well within the expertise of personnel at sewage sludge incineratorfacilities. Flame ionization detectors, including the 150-degree Celsiussampling line cost approximately $20,000. Annual operating costs are expectedto be $6,000.(c) <T3>Calculating A Numeric Limit For Total Hydrocarbons. </T3>The equationto be used in developing a numerical limit for total hydrocarbons is:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,6,2,20</C> <H1>THC </H1><H1>= </H1><H1>RSC </H1>andmultiply; 3,240,000,000<H2>DF </H2>andmultiply; GF<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">THC=Maximum allowable total hydrocarbon concentration in a sewagesludge incinerator stack, in parts per million, at 7-percent oxygen.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">RSC=Risk specific concentration for THC, in micrograms per cubic meter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">DF=Dispersion factor, in micrograms per cubic meter, per gram persecond.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">GF=Maximum gas flow from the sewage sludge incinerator, in gram molesper day.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">3,240,000=Correction factor in gram moles, per gram per second perday.</ITAG>The conversion factor of 3,240,000 is derived from:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,4,4,26</C> <H1>CF</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>86,400andmultiply;0.75andmultiply;1.7andmultiply;1andmultiply;10</H1>6<H2>34</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">86,400=Number of seconds in a day.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">0.75=Correction factor for the estimated loss of organic compoundsin the flame ionization detector system (dimensionless).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.7=Ratio of the flame ionization detector of propane (3.0) to theweighted average flame ionization detector response of the list of compounds(1.8), used to determine the weighted average unit risk.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1andmultiply;106=Conversion parts of per million to concentration.</ITAG>The derivation of this equation is explained more fully in Appendix E ofthe ``Technical Support Document: Incineration of Sewage Sludge'' (Referencenumber 56).As with the equation for the metals, the owner or operator has two optionsfor inserting a value for the dispersion factor. A dispersion factor correspondingto the stack height of the facility's incinerators may be selected fromeither Table 9 of the rule or the owner or operator may conduct air dispersionmodeling of the facility to establish a facility-specific dispersion factorin accordance with EPA's ``Guidelines on Air Quality Models'' (Referencenumber 44).The maximum gas flow (GF) is calculated using the work sheet in AppendixD of today's proposed rule. This work sheet uses the following: (i) Themaximum sludge feed rate; (ii) the average calculated combustion temperatureof the sewage sludge based on the percent volatiles, heating value of thesludge volatiles, and percent solids; and (iii) the average auxiliary fuelusage. The result of the Appendix D calculation is expressed in gram molesof combustion gases at 50 percent excess air (seven percent oxygen) andzero percent moisture.When the flame ionization detector system actually measures the total hydrocarbons,the measurement must be converted to 50 percent excess air (seven percentoxygen) before it is compared to the facility's numerical limit for totalhydrocarbons. Unless this conversion is done, the hydrocarbons would bediluted by the excess air and not represent the actual hydrocarbon concentrationin the exit gases. The oxygen correction is an engineering correction expressedas:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,16,2,12,2,4</C> <H1>THC </H1><T2>(corrected)</T2><H1>=</H1><H1>THC </H1><T2>(actual)</T2><H1>andmultiply;</H1><H1>14</H1><H2>21^Y</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Y=Measured oxygen concentration, percent.</ITAG>The correction factor is developed at 50 percent excess air. The correctionis easily made because EPA is proposing that sewage sludge incineratorshave instruments that continuously monitor the oxygen concentration incombustion gases (andSection; 503.62(f)). The calculated total hydrocarbonlimit is then compared to the oxygen-corrected total hydrocarbon readingfrom the flame ionization detector to determine if the incinerator is incompliance.(d) <T3>Effect of the Proposed Approach. </T3>There are those who believe thatby limiting total hydrocarbons, the Agency is establishing more stringentemission controls than if the Agency were to regulate the concentrationof organics in sewage sludge by developing numerical limits on a pollutant-by-pollutantbasis. They reason that the total hydrocarbon limit is based on the sumof the weighted average Q<T2>1</T2>* values for all carcinogenic organic pollutants listed in IRIS.A pollutant-by-pollutant approach would control the concentration of individualcarcinogenic organic pollutants to a pollutant-by-pollutant individualrisk level of 1andmultiply;10^5. Potentially, the summed risk of ten organicpollutants could be 10andmultiply;10^5 or 1andmultiply;10^4, depending on theactual concentration of a pollutant in the emissions.Based on the Agency's examination of the ten model plants, 122 facilitiesthat operate 219 incinerators are projected to be out of compliance withthe pollutant limits in today's proposal. Of those 122 facilities, a subsetof 28 facilities that operate 61 incinerators are projected to exceed thetotal hydrocarbons numerical limit. However, these facilities also wouldexceed the numerical limit for one or more metals. Therefore, the approachdoes not affect the number of facilities that would be in or out of compliance.The compliance mechanism for a pollutant-by-pollutant approach and fortotal hydrocarbons is the installation of after-burners. After-burnerscost approximately $1 million.(e) <T3>Alternatives Considered._</T3>(i) <T3>Organic Pollutant-by-Organic Pollutant Approach. </T3>EPA originallyconsidered controlling the concentration of organic pollutants fed intoan incinerator on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis, similar to the approachthat the Agency is proposing for metals. However, the approach was notfeasible for organic pollutants because the Agency could not establisha destruction and removal efficiency for sewage sludge incinerators. Theseries of tests on four sewage sludge incinerators revealed that organicdestruction and removal efficiencies of the incinerators ranged from 99.7percent to negative efficiencies of ^1,314 percent (see Table IX-G.2).A negative efficiency means that compounds were formed during the combustionprocess (i.e., a product of incomplete combustion_PIC). Some of these PICsare known or suspected carcinogens. Organic destruction and removal efficiencies(DREs) of an incinerator are needed to relate the emission of an organicpollutant to its risk specific concentration and to an allowable concentrationin sewage sludge. Without consistent DRE data from sewage sludge incinerators,the Agency had no basis on which to construct an equation which could beused to calculate allowable organic concentration.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>IX-G.2._<T4>Organics Identified in Sludge Incenerator Testing</T4><H1>Compounds</H1><H1>DE range</H1><H2>Hi</H2><H2>Low</H2>Semivolatiles:<ITAG tagnum="2">Bis (2-ethylhexyl)phthalate<D>95.7</D><D>ND</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1,2-Dichlorobenzene<D>97.3</D><D>\1\94.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1.3-Dichlorobenzene<D>99.7</D><D>\1\67.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1,4-Dichlorobenzene<D>95.7</D><D>87.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2-Nitrophenol<D>97.2</D><D>ND</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Phenol<D>81.7</D><D>ND</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Naphthalene<D>90.9</D><D>ND</D></ITAG>Volatiles:<ITAG tagnum="2">Acrylonitrile<D>\1\^1.9</D><D>^349.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Benzene<D>\1\25.3</D><D>\1\^1314.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Carbon tetrachloride<D>99.8</D><D>79.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Chlorobenzene<D>99.8</D><D>23.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Chloroform<D>^39.4</D><D>^527.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1,2-Dichloroethane<D>97.0</D><D>ND</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Trans 1,2-Dichloroethene<D>99.4</D><D>\1\76.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Ethylbenzene<D>99.3</D><D>\1\6.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Methylene chloride<D>98.6</D><D>\1\^145.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Tetrachloroethene<D>98.6</D><D>\1\^175.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Toluene<D>99.7</D><D>\1\^256.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">1,1,1-Trichloroethane<D>99.6</D><D>70.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Trichloroethene<D>97.9</D><D>^67.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Vinyl chloride<D>^112.0</D><D>^426</D><F>The pollutant was detected in the stack, but not in the sludge.

The ``TechnicalSupport Document: Incineration of Sewage Sludge'' (Reference number 56)includes all the data used in developing the Figure.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 473</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG>The ability to correlate concentrations of organic compounds emitted withthe concentration of total hydrocarbons in the emission gases persuadedEPA to propose a numerical limit for the concentration of total hydrocarbonsin the emission gases. Setting numerical limits for total hydrocarbonshas several advantages over setting numerical limits for individual organiccompounds in sewage sludge fed into an incinerator. By setting a numericallimit based on the concentration of total hydrocarbons in the emissions,the Agency does not need the DRE of an incinerator. EPA could have proposedthat owners or operators conduct performance tests of their incineratorsto determine the efficiency of their units and then calculate an allowablepollutant concentration based on the results of the performance test. Suchperformance tests cost approximately $20,000 per facility. If the Agency had based limits on the concentration of organic pollutantsin sewage sludge, PICs created during the combustion process would nothave been controlled. By setting numerical limits on the basis of the totalhydrocarbon concentration in the emissions, however, EPA will be limitingthe emission of the organic compounds fed into the incinerators, as wellas those compounds formed during the combustion process. In addition, settingnumerical limits on the basis of total hydrocarbons allows the Agency topropose a more comprehensive rule sooner. The proposed rule for the incinerationof sewage sludge covers all organic pollutants that have a human healthcriterion listed in IRIS. If the Agency were to establish, propose, andpromulgate a pollutant-by-pollutant concentration for potentially hundredsof organic pollutants in sewage sludge, the process would take many years.Furthermore, such a technology-based approach is inconsistent with therequirements of section 405(a) of the CWA to establish pollutant limitsthat are adequate to protect human health and the environment. (ii) <T3>Establish A DRE For The Operation Of Sewage Sludge Incinerators. </T3>TheAgency's existing incinerator regulations are primarily based on the performanceof well-operated incinerators. However, as indicated above the Agency doesnot have sufficient data to determine the DRE for a well-operated incinerator.(iii) <T3>Carbon Monoxide. </T3>EPA considered, but rejected, setting numericallimits for carbon monoxide (CO) in lieu of setting limits for total hydrocarbons.The Agency will propose that hazardous waste incinerators limit the emissionof carbon monoxide to 100 ppm. If the 100 ppm limit is exceeded, facilitieswould be required to monitor total hydrocarbons. The Agency based the 100ppm carbon monoxide limit on a review of the emissions of PICs from a numberof hazardous waste incinerators and boilers that burn hazardous wastes.The data support the conclusion that low carbon monoxide levels (i.e.,less than 100 ppm) are associated with low rates of PICs in hazardous wasteincinerators. However, the Agency could not draw the same conclusion forsewage sludge incinerators (see Table IX-G.3).<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 477-479</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG>The carbon monoxide levels measured in the four sewage sludge incineratortests were much higher than those measured in hazardous waste incinerators.The four sludge incinerators tested had carbon monoxide concentrationsranging from 71 ppm to levels over 2,000 ppm and an overall average carbonmonoxide level of 795 ppm. The Agency also found that, even though thecarbon monoxide level was high for a particular sewage sludge incinerator,the total hydrocarbon concentration was low for the same incinerator. Thus,EPA was unable to correlate carbon monoxide levels in sewage sludge incineratorsto the concentration of organics in the emissions. This may be caused bythe differences between the composition of sludge and hazardous waste anddifferences in incinerator design.Sewage sludge is mostly water, with the combustible portion typically makingup only 20 percent or less. Multiple hearth incinerators typically usedfor the incineration of sewage sludge are designed to remove the watercontent of sludge as efficiently as possible and to handle the large amountof ash left from sewage sludge incineration. The design configuration ofmultiple hearth incinerators results in incomplete combustion due to oxygenstarvation and poor gas mixing and therefore, is not efficient for thecombustion of organic pollutants.Hazardous waste generally contains significant amounts of organic chemicals.To destroy these chemicals, hazardous waste incinerators are designed toachieve turbulent gas mixing, high combustion temperatures, and adequategas residence times. When hazardous waste incinerators are operated properly,they normally achieve carbon monoxide levels well below 100 ppm.(iv) <T3>National Total Hydrocarbon Limit. </T3>Another alternative on whichthe Agency is soliciting comment is the use of a single national totalhydrocarbon limit applicable to all incinerators. This limit would be basedon the information from all of the model plants in our database to calculatea reasonable worse case limit that would be protective at an incrementalcarcinogenic risk level of 1andmultiply;10^5 at most incinerators. For example,if the Agency selected a total hydrocarbon level of 20 ppm our data indicatesthat approximately 80 percent of incinerators would meet 1andmultiply;10^5MEI risk. This approach would replace site-specific total hydrocarbon calculationsat each facility. EPA solicits comments on the merits and implicationsof this type of approach.(f) <T3>Limitations of the Proposed Approach. </T3>EPA recognizes that limiteddata exist to quantify public health risks, particularly for total hydrocarbonemissions. For sewage sludge incinerators, the Agency has been able toidentify and quantify eight to nine percent in the compounds of the totalhydrocarbon emissions. The compounds which were identified, representedsome organic carcinogens of great concern. As previously noted, the riskspecific concentration is extremely sensitive to the compounds not detectedand their assumed concentration. EPA believes its approach of assigningundetected carcinogen detection limit value for the purpose of developingthe weighted Q<T2>1</T2>* value is consistent with the CWA section 405 requirement toprotect human health and the environment. The Agency is continuing to conductemission testing to improve the data base in support of today's proposal.Other concerns raised about today's approach are that it accounts for onlyinhalation health impacts, but does not account for health impacts resultingfrom the indirect exposure to incineration emissions (e.g., through foodor water) or for environmental impacts. At this time, the Agency has notyet developed procedures for quantifying indirect exposure or environmentalimpacts for purposes of establishing regulatory emission limits. However,work is underway to refine these procedures.<ITAG tagnum="84">Example</ITAG>The following example is to be used to illustrate how a sewage sludge incineratorfacility would determine if it could meet the proposed numerical limits.The hypothetical facility has two incinerators with a total capacity of25 dry metric tons per day each and a single stack that is 22 meters high.The sludge to be incinerated has an average volatile fraction of totalsolids of 0.5 and an average volatile solids fraction heating value of5.5 kilocalories per gram. The two incinerators burn 24,000 pounds perday of fuel oil calculated on an annual basis. The sewage sludge to beincinerated contains the following pollutant concentrations:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,14</C> <H1>Pollutant</H1><H1>Concentration (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic<D>4.79</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Beryllium<D>0.548</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>9.54</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium<D>275.91</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>182.04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D>2.15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>69.82</D></ITAG></ITAG>Table 9 in the proposed rule was used to obtain the dispersion factor of14.78 micrograms per cubic meter, per gram per second for a 22-meter stack.The numerical limits for the metals listed above were then calculated usingthe equations described earlier, which are in andSection; 503.63.

If air dispersion modeling were conducted, theowners and operators would need site-specific information, including:andbullet; Stack exit diameter,andbullet; Stack exit gas temperature,andbullet; Stack exit gas velocity,andbullet; Adjacent building dimensions,andbullet; Characteristics of the area around the facility to determine ifthe urban or rural modelling option should be used and whether any terrainfeatures need to be considered, andandbullet; Meteorological data from a nearby meteorologic station or airport.With the site-specific values for the above parameters, the owner or operatorwould use the ISCLT model to obtain a site-specific dispersion factor of10.10 micrograms per cubic meter per gram per second. Therefore, the totalhydrocarbon limit is re-calculated for the site-specific dispersion factorto obtain 5.0 ppm concentration. The hypothetical facility now would meetthe total hydrocarbon limit because the actual reading from the flame ionizationdetector corrected to 50 percent oxygen was 47 ppm.The site-specific dispersion factor was also used to re-calculate the allowablesludge concentrations for the following three pollutants:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Pollutant </H1><H1>Re-calculated numerical limit (mg/kg)</H1><H1>Measured sludge concentration (mg/kg) </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>2.79 </D><D>9.54 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>363.57 </D><D>275.91 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>197.01 </D><D>182.04 </D></ITAG></ITAG>These calculations show that the hypothetical facility would now meet itspollutant limits for lead and chromium, but not for cadmium. The ownersand operators would be, therefore, likely to conduct a test of the incineratorto determine the facility-specific control efficiency for cadmium. Afterperforming the tests for the hypothetical facility, the average sludge-to-stackemissions removal efficiency was found to be 79.0 percent for cadmium.The numerical limit for cadmium was then re-calculated, using the actualcontrol efficiencies and the site-specific dispersion factor of 10.10 microgramsper cubic meter per gram per second to yield: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,10,10 </C> <H1>Pollutant </H1><H1>Re-calculated concentration (mg/kg) </H1><H1>Measured sludge concentration (mg/kg) </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>4.64 </D><D>9.54 </D></ITAG></ITAG>This calculation indicated that the concentration of cadmium in the sludgewas still above the re-calculated numerical limit. The owners or operatorswould have to take some action or combination of actions to bring the incineratorinto compliance. Among the actions they could consider to reduce the actualsludge concentration would be applying more stringent pretreatment limitsor: andbullet; Restricting the feed to the incinerators to lower the sludge feedrate (SF) in the equation; andbullet; Increasing the incinerator control efficiency by installing amore efficient air pollution control system; or andbullet; Increasing the stack height, the stack exit temperature, or thestack exit velocity to reduce the value of the site-specific dispersionfactor in the equation. If the owners or operators decided to upgrade the air pollution controlsystem, however, they would have to retest the incinerator to obtain newemission control efficiencies. If the facility had encountered difficulty in meeting the total hydrocarbonconcentration limit, several corrective actions would be possible: andbullet; Optimize the incinerator operation to obtain higher combustiontemperatures and higher excess air rates to improve combustion of the organicsin sludge; andbullet; Reduce the sludge feed rate and the fuel rate to lower the totalgas flow rate; andbullet; Install an afterburner to further burn the excess total hydrocarbonsand lower the concentration to an acceptable level; orandbullet; Increase the stack height, stack exit temperature, or stack exitvelocity to reduce the value of the site-specific dispersion factor.<ITAG tagnum="81">Stack Height Option</ITAG>The Agency is soliciting comments on whether to deny owners and operatorsof incinerators an opportunity to raise the height of their stacks, afterthe effective date of the rule, as the means of complying with the numericallimits in the rule. Raising the stack height increases the amount of dispersion,thereby reducing the concentration of the pollutants that reach the MEI.However, increasing the height of stacks does not reduce the mass emissionsof the pollutants. Therefore, national cancer incidence (the number ofcancer cases due to the pollutants being emitted) may not change significantly,if owners or operators choose to meet these requirements by merely increasingthe height of their stacks.Today's proposed regulatory approach is designed to limit the exposureof the MEI to a level that does not exceed an incremental carcinogenicrisk of 1 andmultiply; 10^5. The legislative history of section 405 of theCWA directs the Agency to establish numerical limits that protect the healthof individuals or populations which are at higher risk than the populationas a whole (Cong. Rec., S1624, October 16, 1986). If, in complying withthis risk level, all incinerators in the regulatory universe install pollutioncontrol equipment (such as after-burners and wet ESPs), EPA's analysisshows that, in addition to protecting the MEI, reductions would incur inthe total number of projected cancer cases (from 12 to 3) as well as thenumber of projected adverse lead health effects (from 5,800 to 800).However, the possibility exists that, in lieu of installing pollution controlequipment to meet the metal and hydrocarbon limits, some owners or operatorswould only raise the height of their incinerators' stacks to comply withthe pollutant limits. While such an approach would protect the MEI to the1andmultiply; 10^5 risk level, it would not reduce the projected number ofcancer cases (incidence) nationwide as much as the installation of treatmenttechnology. How much reduction could be expected would depend on the numberof facilities choosing to use pollution control equipment rather than merelyincreasing the height of the stacks. EPA has no information at this timeindicating whether some, all, or none of the facilities that cannot meetthe proposed requirements would choose stack height increases over theuse of air pollution control equipment. Factors involved in that localdetermination include whether it is structurally possible to raise theheight of the stacks, comparable costs, local citizen concerns, and Stateand local requirements. EPA will try to gather more information and requeststechnical data and public comments on the environmental and human healthimpacts, and the feasibility and relative cost, of stack height increasesversus the installation and use of pollution control equipment.In addition, the Agency invites public comments on whether the final ruleshould reflect an alternative approach and be directed at not only theMEI's risk, but should also be directed toward reducing the projected nationwidecancer incidence associated with incinerator emissions. The Agency furtherinvites comments on whether specifying compliance methods is consistentwith Section 405 of the CWA.The Agency is concerned that refusing credit for stack height increasesputs EPA in the anomalous position of permitting dispersion credit forexisting tall stacks, while denying credit to others for stack height increases,without any clear rationale for distinguishing the two cases. Consequently,the proposal allows for the calculation of a dispersion factor based onthe actual height of the stack. However, the Agency invites comments onthe alternative of whether to include, in this and other rules, the alternativeof imposing a stack height ceiling of approximately 25 meters for all incinerators(e.g., tall enough to prevent down wash) for the purposes of determiningcompliance with standards.While dispersion credit for stack emissions is granted under certain conditionsunder the Clean Air Act (Section 123), the extent of credit is limited.The intent and practice of granting such credit has been with regard tocriteria pollutants (i.e., particulates, ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfurdioxide, lead, and carbon monoxide), not for many of the potentially toxicair pollutants emitted from sewage sludge incinerators, municipal solidwaste combustors, and hazardous waste incinerators.Finally, in setting requirements for technology-based effluent standardsunder other sections of the CWA, the Agency does not allow the dilutionof pollutants as a means of pollution control. EPA requests comment onthe basis of such a prohibition under Section 405.<ITAG tagnum="81">Compliance</ITAG>The Agency projects that 122 of 194 incinerator facilities will fail tocomply with today's proposed numerical limits. Some of the facilities maymeet the numerical limits without additional air pollution control devices,if owners or operators can demonstrate (e.g., by air dispersion modelingor by a performance test of the incinerators) that dispersion factors otherthan those in Table 9 of the proposed rule or the control efficienciesfor metals other than those in Table 10 of the proposed rule are applicableto their facilities.Eligible POTWs that comply with the proposed requirements in this rulewould be authorized to issue removal credits for the compounds under andSection;503.72 (Tables 11 and 12) of the rule. In addition to the metals (e.g.,arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, and nickel) for whichnumerical limits are proposed in this part, removal credit authority wouldbe available for metals that have been determined to pose no hazard (e.g.,copper, selenium, and zinc) when incinerated. Removal credit authoritywould also be available for the organic pollutants that are listed in IRIS(see Table 11 in andSection; 503.72 of the proposed rule). The Agency islimiting removal credit authority to organic pollutants listed in IRISbecause the human health criterion (weighted Q<T2>1</T2>* value) for total hydrocarbons was based on the existing Q<T2>1</T2>* values listed in IRIS.Section 405(d)(2)(D) of the CWA requires that compliance be as expeditiousas practicable, but in no case later than 1 year after promulgation ofthe regulations, unless construction is required, in which case complianceis to be within 2 years. The Agency urges all sewage sludge incineratorfacility owners or operators to evaluate whether their facilities wouldbe able to comply with the numerical limits included in today's proposal.While incinerator performance tests are not required in this proposal,a facility may wish to conduct a performance test to develop site-specificdata demonstrating that it complies with the requirements of the regulation.Based on the Agency's experience, the time required to plan, conduct, andevaluate the results of incinerator tests may extend beyond a year. Therefore,if owners or operators decide to test their incinerators, waiting untilfinal promulgation of this rule before starting to plan a performance testmay not allow sufficient time to demonstrate compliance.Incineration_Management Practices (andSection; 503.64)<ITAG tagnum="81">Combustion Zone Temperature</ITAG>Today's proposal specifies that incinerators not exceed a temperature of898 degrees Celsius (1,650 degrees Fahrenheit) in the combustion zone.This value would apply unless the owners or operators conducted a performancetest of the incinerator, in which case the temperature recorded duringthe test would apply. The temperature proposed is based on EPA-sponsoredsewage sludge incinerator tests and data from the tests of other sewagesludge incinerators. These data are included in the ``Technical SupportDocument: Incineration of Sewage Sludge'' (Reference number 56).There is considerable evidence that the emission of metals increases whentemperatures exceed those designed for the incinerator. Evaluation of theincinerator tests discussed earlier indicate that, for several metals,the control efficiencies of the incinerators and air pollution controlsystems decrease as the combustion zone temperature increases. The relationshipbetween combustion zone temperature and control efficiency is particularlysignificant for lead, arsenic, and cadmium. Therefore, EPA is proposinga limit on the maximum temperature in the combustion zone of sludge incineratorsto control metal emission levels.<ITAG tagnum="81">Oxygen Content of the Exit Gas</ITAG>Today's proposal specifies that the oxygen content of the exit gas, isnot to exceed 12 percent (dry basis) for multiple hearth incinerators,7 percent (dry basis) for fluidized bed incinerators, 9 percent (dry basis)for electric incinerators, and 12 percent (dry basis) for rotary kiln incinerators.These values would apply unless the owners or operators conducted a performancetest of the incinerator. If a performance test of an incinerator is conducted,the values recorded during the test would apply.The Agency is proposing to limit the oxygen content of the exit gas becausetoo much excess air causes an increase in the total amount of suspendedparticulates in the exhaust gas. Twelve percent oxygen, on a dry gas basis,corresponds to an excess air (oxygen) level of approximately 150 percent.The 12 percent (dry basis) oxygen limit for multiple hearth incineratorsis based on generally accepted design and operating principles for thistype of incinerator (Reference numbers 62 and 35). In addition, resultsfrom the four sludge incinerator tests indicate that lead emissions frommultiple hearth furnances become excessive at excess air rates over 150percent (12 percent oxygen). Seven percent oxygen, on a dry gas basis,for fluidized bed incinerators corresponds to approximately 50 percentexcess air. Operating experience indicates that this limit is typical forfluidized bed incinerators (Reference numbers 35 and 62). Electric furnacesare to be controlled to a maximum oxygen limit of 9 percent, on a dry gasbasis. This limit corresponds to an excess air rate of approximately 70percent, a value that was obtained from the design and operating experienceof a manufacturer of an electric furnace (Reference number 67).No information on the appropriate excess air level for rotary kiln incineratorswas available to the Agency. Therefore, the 12 percent oxygen limit establishedfor multiple hearth furnaces is proposed for any rotary kiln incineratorsburning sewage sludge.EPA is seeking comments on whether values specified for the combustionzone temperature and the oxygen content of the exit gases are reasonablefor sludge incinerators. The Agency is soliciting data from tests thatmay support or question the proposed values.<ITAG tagnum="81">Air Pollution Control Systems</ITAG>EPA is not requiring that the air pollution control systems for sewagesludge incinerators maintain a specific minimum pressure drop. Rather,EPA is requiring that owners or operators install the appropriate air pollutioncontrol systems and instrumentation and that the equipment be operatedto maintain the numerical limits for metals that EPA is proposing today.Most sewage sludge incinerators have wet scrubbers. The major variableaffecting particulate emissions from sewage sludge incinerators is theoperating pressure drop of wet scrubbers. Particulate emission rates alsoare affected by the design of the incinerator, the type and design of thecontrol device used, the characteristics of the sludge that is incinerated,and the method of operation of the incinerators and control devices. The particulate removal efficiency of a given wet scrubber increases asthe pressure drop of the scrubber increases. Emission of particulates andmetals will increase as the pressure drop is decreased for a given incineratorand a given scrubber. Proper operation and maintenance of emission controldevices is a key factor in minimizing particulate emissions from sewagesludge incinerators. However, the appropriate operating parameters areincinerator-specific and cannot be generalized on a nationwide basis. Therefore,EPA is not requiring that a specific minimum pressure drop be maintained.Instead, owners or operators must install the appropriate air pollutioncontrol systems and instrumentation and must operate the equipment to meetthe numerical limits for metals that EPA is proposing today. <ITAG tagnum="81">Other Management Practices Considered</ITAG>EPA also considered specifying minimum combustion zone and exit temperaturesfor combustion gases from sludge incinerators to ensure adequate destructionof organic pollutants. This requirement would have been appropriate ifthe Agency had proposed setting concentrations for specific organic pollutantswith an assumed DRE for the organic pollutants. However, since the Agencyhas decided to propose the continuous monitoring of total hydrocarbonsto measure compliance, specifying minimum combustion system temperaturesis not required. As a consequence of requiring all sewage sludge incineratorsto meet a total hydrocarbon emission concentration, minimum combustiontemperatures will have to be maintained for adequate organic destruction.The Agency also considered specifying minimum excess air rates to ensureadequate destruction of organic pollutants. A minimum level of excess air(oxygen) is required in an incinerator to obtain complete combustion oforganic compounds. This minimum requirement is different for the variousincinerators used for the incineration of sewage sludge. Multiple hearthincinerators usually require higher levels of excess air to destroy organiccompounds than fluidized bed and electric incinerators. However, becausethe Agency is proposing that owners and operators continuously monitorfor total hydrocarbons in the exhaust gases, sludge incinerators will needto provide sufficient excess air to achieve adequate organic pollutantdestruction to meet the total hydrocarbon limits. The proposed rule does not specify any special requirements for scrubberwater, which is usually treated to reduce its solids content. Fly ash residueproduced during scrubber water treatment is de-watered and disposed ofwith the incinerator bottom ash. After solids are removed, treated scrubberwater effluent is generally recycled back to the wastewater treatment plantinfluent. Scrubber water effluent is treated along with the wastewaters,and, when discharged, must meet the facility's effluent limits. Therefore,the scrubber water should not pose risks to human health or the environment.Monitoring, Record Keeping, and Reports (andSection;andSection; 503.81 and503.86)Owners and operators of sewage sludge incinerators are to measure the concentrationsof arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, and nickel inaccordance with the frequencies established for the treatment work andwith the sampling and analysis procedures in andSection; 503.81. In addition,owners and operators must continuously monitor the total hydrocarbon concentrationin the incinerator stack gases, the rate at which sewage sludge is fedto an incinerator, the combustion temperature in the incinerator, the oxygencontent of the exit gas, and the pressure drop across the air pollutioncontrol system, if applicable. The Agency's rationale for these requirementswas explained earlier in the discussion of the requirements for sewagesludge incinerators. The records to be kept are those of the parameters to be monitored as wellas the results of any site-specific air modeling or performance tests conducted.These records are to be kept for 5 years, the period of time specifiedin the State program management regulations (see 40 CFR Part 501). Reportsare to be submitted whenever one of the following occurs: andbullet; The combustion temperature in the incinerator remains outsidethe allowable range for 15 minutes or longer;andbullet; The oxygen content of the exit gas from the incinerator stackremains outside the allowable range for 15 minutes or longer;andbullet; The pressure drop across the air pollution control device exceedsthe allowable drop for longer than one hour, if applicable. The time periods specified are those required in amendments to the NSPSfor sewage sludge incinerations. The rationale for the time periods maybe found in 53 FR 39412 (October 6, 1988). In addition to the requirements mentioned above, reports are to be submittedat the frequencies specified in andSection; 503.81(c) for the total hydrocarbonconcentration in the stack gases of the incinerator and for the sewagesludge feed rate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Removal Credits (Subpart H)</ITAG>Pollutant-contaminated industrial wastewater that is discharged to POTWscan inhibit or upset POTW treatment systems and pass through the facilityto surface waters or into the sludge generated by these facilities. Toprevent this interference, pass through, and sludge contamination, Congressdirected EPA to establish national pretreatment standards for industrialdischarges into POTWs (see section 307(b)(1) of the CWA, 33 U.S.C. 1317(b)(1)).These pretreatment standards limit the amount of a pollutant that plantsin an industrial category may discharge into a POTW. However, to avoidredundancy in treatment capacity, the Act authorized the POTW to revisea categorical pretreatment standard for an industrial user by adjustingthe amount of a pollutant the plant may discharge to the POTW. The revisionin the categorical pretreatment standard is based on the percentage ofthe pollutant removed by the POTW. A ``removal credit'' is the differencebetween the categorical pretreatment standard and the revised pretreatmentstandard. A removal credit allows the POTW's industrial user to dischargegreater quantities of a particular pollutant than would otherwise be allowedby the categorical pretreatment standard. The CWA authorizes these revisionsin the categorical pretreatment standards provided that certain criteriaare met. Among these criteria is a requirement that the increased dischargeto the POTW by the industrial user does not cause a deterioration in sludgequality or interfere with sludge use or disposal.In 1984, EPA issued rules implementing the pretreatment removal creditsprovision (40 CFR 403.7). However, in a 1986 response to a challenge bythe Natural Resources Defense Council, the United States Court of Appealsfor the Third Circuit found the regulation invalid (<T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</T3>, 790 F.2d 289, 3d Cir., 1986).EPA has now amended the regulations to respond to all but one of the ThirdCircuit's four holdings (52 FR 42434, November 5, 1987). Its fourth holdingwas that EPA may not authorize POTWs to grant removal credits to theirindustrial users until EPA promulgates the comprehensive regulation requiredby section 405(d). Thus, upon promulgation of regulation that is proposedtoday, POTWs that manage their sludge by the use or disposal methods coveredin the proposed rule (land application, distribution and marketing, disposalin monofills and on surface disposal sites, and incineration) may applyto EPA for removal credit authority. EPA may grant such authority to anyPOTW that complies with the procedural and substantive requirements ofthe removal credits regulation and this part. Moreover, EPA may grant suchauthority to any POTW that disposes of its sewage sludge in a MSWLF incompliance with 40 CFR Part 258.EPA's removal credit regulation (40 CFR 403.7) provides that, subject tothe conditions of the regulation, any POTW receiving wastewater from anindustrial user to which a categorical pretreatment standard applies, atits discretion, may grant a removal credit to reflect removal of pollutantsspecified in the categorical pretreatment standard by the POTW. A POTWis authorized to grant a removal credit if five conditions are met. First,the POTW must receive authorization to grant removal credits from EPA orthe authorized approval authority in an NPDES State with an approved Statepretreatment program. Next, the POTW must demonstrate and continue to achieveconsistent removal of pollutants. Third, the POTW must have an approvedpretreatment program. Fourth, the granting of a removal credit must notcause the POTW to violate local, State, or Federal sludge requirementsfor the sludge management method chosen by the POTW. Finally, grantingremoval credits must not cause a POTW to violate its NPDES permit conditionsor limitations (40 CFR 403.7(a)(3)).Pollutants for Which Removal Credits May Be Authorized (andSection; 503.72)Provided a POTW complies with all other applicable requirements, removalcredits would be available for the pollutants listed below.<ITAG tagnum="81">The 65 Pollutants Regulated in One or More Use or Disposal Methods</ITAG>If a POTW uses or disposes of its sludge through one of the methods forwhich standards are developed in today's proposal and meets the numericallimits and management practices for that use or disposal method, the POTWwould then be authorized to grant a removal credit for the pollutants regulatedin the practice employed by the POTW.Many facilities may use one or more methods for disposing of their sewagesludge. EPA has concluded that certain pollutants may pose a greater threatto human health and the environment in particular use of disposal methods.For POTWs using one or more use or disposal methods, removal credits wouldonly be available if the concentration of the pollutants do not exceedthe lowest concentration for the use or disposal method employed by thePOTW.<ITAG tagnum="81">The 17 Pollutants Which EPA Examined Without Establishing NumericalLimits </ITAG>Removal credits would also be available for 17 pollutants in one or moreuse or disposal methods because, at the highest concentrations shown, thepollutant did not pose an unreasonable risk. When a POTW uses or disposesof its sludge through one of the methods for which a pollutant was evaulatedfor adverse effect in accordance with the requirements of this part, aremoval credit would be authorized for that pollutant. However, a removalcredit would only be available so long as the concentration of the pollutantin the POTW's sludge did not exceed the numbers evaluated by EPA for adverseeffects. These values are included on Table 12 in andSection; 503.72 of theproposed rule. In most cases, these concentrations represent the very highestvalues, in excess of expected current sludge quality levels. EPA solicitscomment on the appropriateness of the capping concentrations of these pollutantsfor the purpose of removal credits. EPA also solicits data concerning concentrationof these pollutants in sludge.<ITAG tagnum="81">Pollutants Disposed of in MSWLFs</ITAG>A POTW that disposes of its sewage sludge in a MSWLF and meets the requirementsof 40 CFR Part 258 would be eligible to issue removal credits for the pollutantsin its sludge. EPA has made the determination that the requirements in40 CFR Part 258 are adequate to protect human health and the environmentfrom any reasonably anticipated adverse effects of each pollutant. Some POTWs may employ other use or disposal methods in combination withdisposal in a MSWLF. Under those circumstances, EPA is considering limitingremoval credits to those pollutants for which specific numerical limitshave been established in order to encourage the maximum beneficial reuseof sewage sludge. The Agency remains concerned that such an approach mayhave the opposite effect. It may encourage POTWs to dispose of all theirsludge in landfills, rather than using some of their sludge in a beneficialmanner. The Agency solicits comment on this concern.<ITAG tagnum="84">Hazardous Sludge</ITAG>EPA has also determined that compliance with the requirements in 40 CFRParts 261 through 268 (promulgated under Subtitle C of RCRA) when disposingof hazardous sludge will constitute compliance with Section 405 of theCWA. Thus, this type of sludge disposal will be a regulated disposal methodunder the comprehensive section 405 system. It could be argued that hazardousconcentrations of pollutants disposed of under RCRA Subtitle C, by definition,do not interfere with sludge use and disposal and, therefore, removal creditsshould be available for such pollutants. However, in the case of pollutantconcentrations which result in a hazardous sludge, allowing industrialusers to obtain removal credits for such pollutants would be inconsistentwith statutory objections of improving sludge quality and encouraging beneficialreuse. The availability of removal credits would permit the industrialuser to reduce its level or treatment, shifting the removal burden to thePOTW and ensuring that the sludge was unavailable for a beneficial use.EPA does not intend that its comprehensive sludge management program andthe availability of removal credits encourage any increase in the generationof highly contaminated sludge. <ITAG tagnum="84">Phenolic Compounds </ITAG>EPA is also requesting comment on another issue. Certain phenolic compounds(e.g., parent phenol) are regulated for a number of different use and disposalmethods but are determined not to represent a threat to human health andthe environment for other methods. Consequently, removal credits wouldbe available for those pollutants. The Agency notes that its pretreatmentstandards regulated 4AAP, an indicator for parent phenol and certain otherphenolic compounds. The Agency is considering whether or not removal creditsshould be available for the family of compounds represented by 4AAP. Onlythe parent phenol and certain other phenolic compounds were the subjectof an environmental assessment. EPA believes that removal credits shouldbe available only for that portion of 4AAP that measures the specific compoundswhich were subject to an environmental assessment. The Agency requestsinformation on whether 4AAP will consistently reflect the levels of thedifferent phenolic compounds present in the wastewater. <ITAG tagnum="84">Monitoring, Record Keeping, and Reports (Subpart I)</ITAG>Purpose (andSection; 503.80)This subpart contains the minimum monitoring, record keeping, and reportingrequirements necessary to ensure that treatment works, users, and disposerscomply with the requirements of the rule. The Agency is requesting publiccomment on the appropriateness of placing these requirements with the Part503 technical standards. As an alternative, the Agency is considering theconsolidation of the record keeping and reporting requirements in today'sproposal with the State program management requirements (40 CFR Part 501)and with the NPDES permitting requirements (40 CFR Parts 122 through 124).Such an approach would consolidate requirements that are primarily administrative.However, the argument can also be made that, along with the monitoringrequirements, record keeping and reporting requirements are an integralpart of the technical standards.The Agency is proposing that treatment works monitor a representative sampleof their sewage sludge for two classes of pollutants. The first class entailspollutants with specific numerical limits for the use or disposal methodemployed by the treatment work (i.e., 25 pollutants for the land applicationof sewage sludge, 22 pollutants for the distribution and marketing of sewagesludge, 18 pollutants for the disposal of sewage sludge in monofills andon surface disposal sites, and seven pollutants for the incineration ofsewage sludge). The second class contains those pollutants listed on Table12 of andSection; 503.72, i.e., those pollutants for which the POTW may granta removal credit. Monitoring frequency is based on the wastewater flow of the facility. Facilitiesthat have a wastewater flow of less than one million gallons per day (mgd)would monitor once a year. Those with a wastewater flow of 1 to 10 mgdwould monitor quarterly. Those with a wastewater flow over 10 mgd wouldmonitor monthly. The Agency is considering alternatives such as monthlymonitoring the first year and then specifying alternative frequencies ina treatment work's permit, based on the variability of the first-year'smonitoring results. Sludge with pollutant concentrations that constantlyfluctuate would be monitored more frequently than sludge with uniform pollutantconcentrations. Another approach that the Agency is considering, is tospecify monitoring frequencies based on the industrial flow into the facility.Permitting authorities may impose more comprehensive and more frequentmonitoring requirements than those in today's proposal. Nothing in thissubpart precludes the establishment of more stringent requirements. TheAgency encourages permitting authorities to recommend alternative monitoringand reporting frequencies as part of their comments on today's proposal.The discussion included in this section of the preamble is limited to thegeneral requirements that are applicable to treatment works, irrespectiveof the method by which they use or dispose of their sewage sludge. Monitoring,recording keeping, and reporting requirements that are specific to a particularmethod were discussed in connection with that method.General (6,503. 81)<ITAG tagnum="81">Sampling Protocols</ITAG>EPA is proposing that treatment works collect and analyze their sewagesludge samples in accordance with ``Sampling Procedures and Protocols forthe National Sewage Sludge Survey,'' EPA, Office of Water Regulations andStandards, March 1988 (Reference number 55). The sampling procedures andprotocols included in this document were compiled specifically for theNational Sewage Sludge Survey described elsewhere in this preamble. Theprocedures are specific to sewage sludge and describe the type of representativesamples to be collected, sample locations, sample collection procedures,equipment to be used, procedures for handling liquid and solid samples,and procedures for sample handling and preservation.Prior to the Survey, these procedures were extensively reviewed withinthe Agency and by the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies, Associationof State and Interstate Water Pollution Control Administrators, ChicagoMetropolitan Sanitary District, and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.In conducting the Survey, EPA has found that the procedures worked well,irrespective of the size and complexity of the plant sampled. EPA believesthat these standard procedures will improve the quality and consistencyof data and ensure the integrity of samples collected prior to analysis.These procedures are also found in Chapter 2 of ``POTW Sludge Samplingand Analysis Guidance Document'' (Reference number 87). This document includesother relevant information that POTWs may find helpful.<ITAG tagnum="81">Analytical Methods</ITAG>The preferred analytical methods for determining the concentration of organicand inorganic compounds in sewage sludge and for the determining the fractionof total, dissolved, and suspended solids in sewage sludge are listed in``Analytical Methods for the National Sewage Sludge Survey,'' Office ofWater, Sample Control Center, March 1988 (Reference number 51). These proceduresare also found in Chapter 3 of ``POTW Sludge Sampling and Analysis GuidanceDocument'' (Reference number 87).Methods 1624 and 1625 are isotope dilution, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC/MS) methods for analyzing volatile and semi-volatile organic pollutantsamenable to GC/MS. Isotope dilution uses a stable, isotopically labeledanalog as an internal standard for the analysis of a compound. As an alternativeto Methods 1624 and 1625, EPA lists Methods 624 and 625 found in 40 CFRPart 136. However, Methods 624 and 625 do not have the same precision andaccuracy as do Methods 1624 and 1625. Methods 624 and 625 can not distinguishbetween similar compounds in a sludge matrix. Therefore, the Agency issoliciting public comment on whether it should limit acceptable methodsto 1624 and 1625. Method 1618, used for pesticides, is undergoing further validation as partof the National Sewage Sludge Survey. EPA requests laboratories that haveused Method 1618 to provide the Agency with an evaluation of the methodin conjunction with their comments on today's proposal. Any changes inMethod 1618 will be published in the ``Federal Register'' as part of theNotice on the results of the National Sewage Sludge Survey. The methods for analyzing inorganic pollutants in ``Analytical Methodsfor the National Sewage Sludge Survey'' are fully validated methods andwere compiled from: andbullet; ``Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes,'' EPA, Cincinnati,OH, March 1983 (EPA-600/4-79-020), currently available from National TechnicalInformation Service, Springfield, VA 22161 (PB84-128677); and andbullet; ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste,'' EPA, Washington,DC, November 1986 (SW-846), currently available from the Superintendentof Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 20402. The methods for analyzing pathogenic bacteria, animal viruses, fecal coliform,fecal streptococci, protozoa, helminth ova, volatile solids, volatile suspendedsolids, and SOUR were described in the discussion of the pathogen and vectorattraction reduction requirements. The equation for calculating the percentvolatile solids reduction was also described in that subpart of this partof the preamble. The Agency is seeking public comment on the proposed methods for measuringthe parameters included in today's proposal. Alternative methods will becarefully evaluated and may be included in the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">PART X: IMPLEMENTATION OF 40 CFR PART 503 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Clean Water Act </ITAG>The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act (CWA) included significant changesto section 405 of the CWA with regard to the implementation of the technicalstandards for the use and disposal of sewage sludge. Prior to the 1987amendments, the CWA required that EPA develop standards for the use anddisposal of sewage sludge, but did not specify whether the standards wereto be implemented through permits and, if so, under what authority. Traditionally,National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) jurisdiction ariseswhen there is a discharge of pollutants to navigable waters from a pointsource. Thus, there was some question about the applicability of NPDESpermits to regulate sewage sludge disposal that did not involve dischargesto navigable waters. Likewise, other permits either are media-specific(e.g., permits issued under the Clean Air Act) or regulate particular substancesor methods of disposal (e.g., Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation andRecovery Act_RCRA). Therefore, they were also ill-equipped to comprehensivelyregulate across all media the use and disposal of sewage sludge. The 1987 amendments establish a program with the objective of protectingpublic health and the environment from the adverse effects of pollutantsin sewage sludge. This is to be accomplished by developing technical standardsthat establish pollutant limits and management practices for each use anddisposal method and implementing these standards through permits. The 1987amendments make it plain that the technical standards are to be implementedthrough NPDES permits, unless the standards are included in a permit issuedeither under one of the listed Federal programs or by an approved Statesludge program. Section 405(f)(1), as amended, provides: <ITAG tagnum="21">Through Section 402 Permits._Any permit issued under section 402 ofthis Act to a publicly owned treatment works or any other treatment workstreating domestic sewage shall include requirements for the use and disposalof sludge that implement the regulations established pursuant to subsection(d) of this section, unless such requirements have been included in a permitissued under the appropriate provisions of subtitle C of the Solid WasteDisposal Act, part C of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Marine Protection,Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, or the Clean Air Act, or under Statepermit programs approved by the Administrator, where the Administratordetermines that such programs assure compliance with any applicable requirementsof this section * * *. </ITAG>Thus the Act provides authority to implement the standards through NPDESpermits where the standards are not included in a Clean Air Act permit,a RCRA subtitle C permit, a Marine Protection, Sanctuaries, and ResearchAct permit, an Underground Injection Control permit under the Safe DrinkingWater Act, or an approved State program permit. It is clear that permitcoverage among the programs is to be complementary, not duplicative. However,it is also clear that permit coverage of publicly owned treatment works(POTWs) and other treatment works is to be comprehensive and that no facilitiesare to go unpermitted because they fall outside the traditional jurisdictionof media-specific programs. If the POTW or other treatment work treatingdomestic sewage does not have an NPDES permit or any of the other permitslisted in section 405(f)(1), the CWA authorizes the issuance of a permitsolely to implement the sludge standards (see CWA section 405(f)(2)). In addition to the requirement that the standards be implemented throughpermits, the other important provision of section 405(f)(1) allows a Stateto issue permits to implement the technical standards where the State permitprogram has been approved by the Administrator. The Administrator may approveState programs that he finds will assure compliance with the requirementsof section 405.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulations For Implementation Of The Technical Standards And ForState Program Approval</ITAG>EPA proposed State sludge management program regulations that appearedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 4, 1986 (51 FR 4458). These regulationsset forth minimum program requirements and procedures for States to obtainapproval of their sludge management programs. These regulations would haverequired that the States develop sludge management programs which wouldassure that sludge use and disposal complied with the technical standards.Because these regulations were proposed prior to the Water Quality Act(WQA) of 1987, they did not require that the States develop permit programs.On March 9, 1988, EPA proposed new State program and permitting requirements(53 FR 7642). These regulations will implement the WQA requirement thatpermits issued to POTWs and other treatment works treating domestic sewagecontain the sludge standards and the requirement that EPA promulgate proceduresfor the approval of State programs. The purpose of the State program andpermitting rules is to provide the implementation framework for the sludgetechnical standards proposed today by: (1) Providing permit conditionsto incorporate the standards into permits, as well as additional requirementsto track compliance with the standards; and (2) setting approval requirementsfor State sludge programs so that they can implement the Section 405 requirements.The March 9, 1988 proposed rules contained three principal sections. First,the proposed rules would revise the existing NPDES permitting regulationsat 40 CFR Part 122 and 124 to include sludge conditions in NPDES permits.Second, the proposed rules contained revisions to 40 CFR Part 123 for Stateswith NPDES authority that wish to modify their existing NPDES program toinclude the regulation of sewage sludge. Third, the March 9, 1988 proposalcontains a separate section with requirements for State sludge programsthat are not based on NPDES. Thus, these regulations reflect the CWA'sstipulation that the sludge standards may be included in any of a numberof permits under different programs, so long as they are addressed in apermit. The regulations do not require that States implement the sludgestandards through the NPDES program. Where EPA is the permitting authority(i.e., where the State has not sought and obtained approval of its sludgeprogram), the sludge requirements will be primarily implemented throughNPDES permits, unless the requirements are contained in one of the otherlisted Federal permits. These regulations are scheduled to be promulgatedin April 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Requirements Prior To Promulgation Of The Technical Standards</ITAG>The WQA also requires that, prior to promulgation of the technical standards,NPDES permits issued to POTWs are to contain sludge conditions. Moreover,the Administrator is authorized to take other appropriate measures to protectpublic health and the environment from the adverse effects of sewage sludge(see CWA section 405(d)(4)). In response to this call for controls beforepromulgation of the technical standards, EPA has developed an interim strategyfor sludge permitting. The ``interim'' or ``pre-technical standards'' sludgeprogram for implementing section 405(d)(4) of the CWA is contained in adocument entitled ``Strategy for Interim Implementation of Sludge Requirementsin Permits Issued to POTWs'' (see Notice of Availability of this document,53 FR 1987, May 31, 1987). Once the technical standards proposed todayare promulgated, the use and disposal of sewage sludge will be regulatedby those standards and by the permitting and State program requirements.The ``interim'' program will continue to apply to those facilities, pollutants,and use and disposal methods not covered by the technical standards. EPA'sauthority to impose permit limits developed on a case-by-case basis willcontinue with respect to pollutants and management practices not regulatedby the technical standards.EPA is sensitive to the problems that may arise if ``interim'' conditionssignificantly differ from those that will be required by the technicalregulations. Thus, in developing its interim permitting strategy, the Agencyhas sought to adopt approaches which are consistent with the anticipateddirection of the technical standards. In addition, a primary emphasis ofthe interim strategy will be ensuring compliance with existing federalrequirements, such as 40 CFR Part 257. Generally, additional limits willbe required only for POTWs with known or suspected sludge use or disposalproblems. The recommendations for additional limits are based on existingfederal guidance and State requirements, and consist in most cases of bestmanagement practices, rather than numerical limits. EPA has adopted thisapproach in recognition that such measures are interim only. EPA's primaryobjective under section 405(d)(4) remains the protection of public healthand the environment.The anti-backsliding provision of section 402(o) of the CWA does not applyto sewage sludge use and disposal activities. This means that if the permitcontains limits developed on a case-by-case basis (i.e., based on the permitwriter's best professional judgement) under EPA's interim sludge permittingstrategy which are more stringent than subsequently promulgated Part 503standards, the reissued permit could include limits based on the less stringentPart 503 standards rather than the more stringent case-by-case interimlimit. This would be true not only for pollutant concentration limits,but also for monitoring or testing requirements or management practicesin Part 503. Because the Part 503 standards (and permit conditions implementingthem) must protect public health and the environment, from reasonably anticipatedadverse effects, ``backsliding'' from more stringent interim limits shouldnot result in any significant adverse public health or environmental effects.<ITAG tagnum="84">PART XI: BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THE PROPOSED RULES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative and Statutory Requirements</ITAG>As explained in Part II of this preamble, section 405(d) of the Clean WaterAct (CWA), directs EPA to publish information on the costs of sludge useand disposal. In addition to this legislative requirement, Executive Order12291 directs EPA to analyze and consider the cost and impact associatedwith this proposed regulation. This Executive Order, signed in February1981, addresses various concerns about Federal regulations, including arequirement to develop a Regulatory Impact Analysis for all major regulations,which are defined as those that impose an annual cost to the economy of$100 million or more or that meet other economic impact criteria. Basedon the Agency's estimates of the incremental costs of complying with theproposed regulation, the Agency considers today's action to be a majorrule as defined in Executive Order 12291, and has prepared an extensiveanalysis of the benefits, costs, and other impacts associated with theproposed regulations. This analysis, ``Regulatory Impact Analysis of theProposed Regulations for Sewage Sludge Use and Disposal'' (hereafter referredto as the RIA), is part of the record for this rulemaking and copies areavailable for review and comment (see Part XIII on availability of technicalinformation). The RIA was transmitted to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) with the notice of proposed rulemaking. OMB's comments are presentedin the public record for this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Overview of the RIA</ITAG>The RIA presents an evaluation of the costs, benefits, and economic impactassociated with the proposed regulation. Although the proposed regulationapplies to all treatment works except privately owned treatment works treatingdomestic sewage along with industrial waste and wastewater, the RIA pertainsonly to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). This is due to the lackof data indicating the nature and extent of private ownership of such treatmentworks.The analysis begins with an assessment of the sludge disposal methods currentlyused by POTWs and then evaluates the impact of new or additional requirementsimposed by the proposed regulation. The RIA also presents the costs andimpacts of three other regulatory options that the Agency considered. Eachof the options reflects a separate set of regulatory requirements. Theimpacts of each of these three options are briefly discussed earlier inthe preamble (Part VIII, see Table VIII-1) and are covered in detail inthe RIA. The following discussion focuses only on the regulatory optionthat is the basis for today's proposed rulemaking.The Agency's overall approach to the RIA recognizes that, in addition tocompliance costs for testing, monitoring, record keeping, and other requirements,a POTW may be required to alter its current method of sludge use or disposalto achieve compliance with the regulation. These changes could includeshifts to a new or different combination of disposal methods, installationor operation of pollution control equipment, or increased reliance on industrialpretreatment. The costs of these changes are evaluated for each of theuse and disposal methods. The benefits associated with complying with theregulation in the form of reduced health risks are also evaluated. TheRIA presents quantified estimates of these benefits, expressed as a reductionin as the number of cancer cases and other health effects.There are more than 15,000 POTWs in the U.S. processing nearly 28 billiongallons of wastewater a day. POTWs provide various degrees of pollutantremoval depending on the level of treatment in place. The levels of treatmentare generally described as pretreatment, preliminary treatment, primarytreatment, secondary treatment, advanced treatment, and no discharge. Thelevel of treatment employed in a given facility determines, in part, thepurity of the plant's effluent and the quantity and pollutant content ofthe facility's sludge. The more than 15,000 POTWs in the United Statesgenerate an estimated 7.7 million dry metric tons of sewage sludge annually.The proposed regulations are expected to cover 5,367 POTWs, which is anestimate of the facilities currently using the use and disposal methodsthat are specifically addressed by the proposed regulations. These facilitiesproduce about 56 percent of the total sludge volume. Of the remaining POTWs,an estimated 6,664 (accounting for 41 percent of the total sludge volume)dispose of sludge in landfills that are specifically controlled by otherstatutory requirements and are covered in today's regulation by the requirementsin proposed Part 258 of RCRA (see Part IX and Part XIV of the preamble).In addition, 3,274 POTWs use other disposal practices that will be addressedin future rulemakings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Impacts of the Proposed Regulation</ITAG>For the disposal practices covered by the regulation, the Agency projectsincremental annual compliance costs of $157.7 million (1987 dollars), oran average of $5 per household served by these facilities. The total annualcosts include costs for management practices (e.g., sludge testing, recordkeeping, emissions testing) and, in some cases, incremental costs for achange in the method of use or disposal. In addition, the regulation willresult in benefits consisting of reduced effects on human health resultingfrom reduced exposure to pollutant contaminants. The Agency estimates thatthe benefits of this proposed rule will be an annual reduction of 9.5 cancercases and 5,266 cases of other health effects. The proposed regulationsare also expected to create certain environmental benefits as a consequenceof the improved use and disposal practices.

Data pertaining to the manner in which specificfacilities would react to the proposed regulations are not available. Instead,the compliance strategies for which costs were calculated represent anestimate of the incremental cost of compliance that POTWs face overall.In light of the uncertainties associated with any particular POTW's compliancestrategy, the Agency estimated the incremental cost of compliance as follows.For land application, the estimated compliance cost is based on eithera shift to municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) or a change in enduses and sludge processes (e.g., composting). For distribution and marketing,the costs represent a shift in practice to non-agricultural land applicationunder a contractual arrangement or incineration for those POTWs that arenot expected to be in compliance. For monofills, the costs reflect a shiftto either co-disposal landfills (i.e., landfills accepting sludge and municipalwaste) or incineration for the facilities estimated to be in non-compliance.For the facilities currently using sewage sludge surface disposal, thecompliance costs reflect a shift to co-disposal in MSWLFs or to compostingand non-agricultural land application. For the facilities that currentlyuse incineration but are not expected to be in compliance, the costs arebased on additional pollution control equipment. The feasibility of pretreatment by industrial dischargers as a compliancealternative was also evaluated as part of the RIA. Depending on site-specificconditions, the effects of industrial pretreatment on sludge quality couldbe significant. The Agency currently lacks sufficient information to reachwidely applicable conclusions regarding the improvements to sludge quality(and, therefore, the ability to attain compliance) from locally-imposed,industrial pretreatment requirements. In an effort to highlight the potential importance of pretreatment, theAgency conducted a limited number of case studies on the effect of industrialpretreatment on municipal sludge quality as part of the RIA. Pollutantremovals were estimated for all industrial dischargers covered by categoricalstandards. Estimates were also made reflecting treatment levels beyondthat represented by the standards. (The pretreatment case studies are describedin the RIA.) The Agency found, in these particular cases, that an increasein industrial pretreatment provides a significant reduction in the amountof pollutants in the sludge. The portion of pollutant pounds removed fromsludge in the case studies ranged from 6 to 96 percent. The reduction inpollutant levels from pretreatment enabled one of the case study POTWsto achieve compliance with the sludge disposal criteria. The case studies' findings are limited by the site-specific nature of theanalysis. The results are dependent on the type and size of the industrialdischargers. The analysis is also limited in that the improvements in sludgequality were based on removals for only a subset of pollutants in the sludge_thosefor which categorical standards have been established. Other pollutantsthat may be affected by local limits were not included in the case studies.Thus, industrial pretreatment could potentially be more of a solution toreducing pollutant levels in municipal sludge than is indicated by thesecase study results. <ITAG tagnum="84">Limitations of the RIA </ITAG>The regulatory analysis described here is limited by the general scarcityof current and reliable data on sewage sludge use and disposal methodsand pollutant concentrations in municipal sewage sludge. The analysis isalso constrained by a lack of specific information as to how POTWs wouldreact to resolve or eliminate compliance difficulties, particularly wherechanges in use of disposal methods are indicated. Lacking such detailedinformation, the Agency relies on a number of baseline assumptions pertainingto sludge volumes for each use or disposal method, the costs of existingmethods, compliance with the proposed regulation, and potential shiftsin methods that may occur. The RIA results, including incremental compliancecosts, are strongly influenced by these analytical assumptions. The most significant limitation is related to the scarcity of data concerningsewage sludge quality. In the absence of a comprehensive data base, andlacking facility-specific information about sludge quality, the Agencyrelied on an EPA study completed in 1981, ``Fate of Priority Toxic Pollutantsin Publicly Owned Treatment Works'' (Reference number 36, hereafter referredto as the ``40 City Study''). Although the study provided data from thelargest available sample of nationally distributed treatment plants, itwas not specifically designed to support the sewage sludge regulation.Thus, use of this study for sludge quality data is limited by such factorsas the locations in the plant where sludge samples were taken, the analyticalmethods used for measuring the pollutant concentrations, the pollutantsanalyzed, and the use of the analytical results. The study also only provideddata for POTWs. The Agency used the data from the ``40 City Study'' to develop three profilesof sludge quality to represent sludge from all publicly owned wastewatertreatment plants. In addition to the limitations of the data mentionedabove, the sludge quality profiles are further limited by the procedureused to assign the profiles to each of the POTWs. One of the three sludgequality profiles was assigned to each POTW, based on the percentage ofindustrial influent in the POTW's wastewater. This procedure assumes thereis an association between high percentages of industrial influent and highconcentrations of pollutants in the sludge. In fact, this intuitively logicalrelationship has not been convincingly verified by the Agency's analysisof the ``40 City Study''. We believe our assumption is valid, and thatthe failure of the ``40 City Study'' data to support this conclusion furtherdemonstrates the limitations of the data. The quality of sewage sludge is the basis for determining (1) the abilityof POTWs to comply with the proposed regulation, (2) the subsequent impactof non-compliance, and (3) the risks associated with sludge use and disposal.The actual sludge quality at POTWs (i.e., the concentrations of pollutantsin sludge) could be significantly different from the sludge quality dataused in developing the RIA. Based on the limitations of the sludge qualitydata, it is possible that the quality of sewage sludge has been misinterpretedand the impact of the proposal over- or understated. There are other limitations to the RIA that result from the scarcity ofdata. The RIA does not include any analysis for treatment works other thanPOTWs. In addition, the volume of sludge generated by POTWs using the varioussludge disposal practices was estimated based on the volume of wastewaterprocessed as reported in the ``1986 Needs Survey''. These estimates maynot be accurate because they may not reflect up-to-date wastewater treatmentprocess information. This information affects the estimates of volume ofsludge generated. Other limitations tied to the scarcity of facility-specific informationinclude an inability to evaluate those parts of the proposed regulationthat establish maximum pollutant limitations using site-specific parameters.When addressing site-specific criteria in the RIA, the Agency again relieson sludge quality profiles and model plants to represent actual facilities.The lack of facility-specific data also limits the Agency's ability todetermine how POTWs will achieve compliance with the regulation. The decisionto adopt an alternative disposal practice, to add pollution control equipment,or to require additional pretreatment from industrial dischargers willbe made by individual POTWs based on a variety of site-specific conditionsand considerations. In the absence of facility-specific information, theAgency relied on a limited number of assumptions concerning the effectof local factors on compliance strategy. As an example, shifts to MSWLFsfrom other methods of use or disposal were considered to be unlikely forlarge volume POTWs located in areas where landfill capacity is constrained.Another limitation of the RIA relates to the distribution of disposal methodsamong POTWs. The Agency estimated the distribution of disposal practicesusing original research and a limited amount of existing data (sourcesare identified in the RIA). For analytical purposes, each facility wasassumed to employ only one use or disposal method. In reality, many POTWsuse more than one method.These limitations are important because they affect the compliance costestimates_some of them to a significant degree. Some of the limitationstend to overstate compliance costs. For example, some POTWs that incineratesludge are likely to be able to change operations (e.g., decrease feedrate) or depend on other site-specific characteristics (e.g., very highstack height) to avoid the expenditures that the RIA projects for out-of-complianceunits to install additional pollution control technologies. In fact, EPAexpects that POTWs producing sludge which fails to meet the numerical limitswill try any and all low-cost solutions rather than use higher-cost alternativessuch as changes in their basic use or disposal method. Some of the other limitations used in the RIA may have the result of understatingthe impacts of the proposed regulations. For example, EPA has assumed thatthe smaller POTWs currently operating sludge monofills that are out ofcompliance will shift to MSWLFs. This assumption is based on the premisethat these smaller POTWs are located in non-metropolitan or rural areasthat have land available for new and existing landfill sites. We recognize,however, that the availability and cost of landfilling are becoming seriousproblems in virtually all areas of the country due to increased publicresistance to siting new landfills or expanding current landfills. Given the scarcity of data that might better indicate how affected POTWswill react to the sewage sludge use and disposal regulations, EPA is confidentthat the compliance costs provided in the RIA are reasonable estimatesof such reactions and costs. Taken together, the Agency believes that theRIA methodology neither understates nor overstates the regulations' costs.In an effort designed, in part to eliminate many of the limitations ofthe analysis, the Agency has initiated an information collection effortdesigned, in part, to provide national estimates of sludge quality, sewagesludge use and disposal practices, and general characteristics of individualfacilities (see discussion of the National Sewage Sludge Survey in PartIII of this preamble). The Agency is also soliciting comments on severalaspects of the procedures and assumptions in the RIA to improve the analysisand better assess the impact of the proposed regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Description Of The Methodology </ITAG>To evaluate the costs of compliance and benefits associated with the proposedregulations, the RIA first outlines the general characteristics of thewastewater treatment industry. This covers the types of treatment facilities,the number and size of facilities, the quantity of sewage sludge generated,the quality of sewage sludge, the amount of sludge used or disposed ofby each method, and the costs of each use and disposal method. Estimatesof the number, size, and types of treatment facilities are based on the``1986 Needs Survey''. National estimates of the distribution of sewagesludge use and disposal methods among POTWs and the quantity of sludgedisposed by each method were developed using original research and existingdata (see the previous section of this part). For analytical purposes,each facility was assumed to use only one use or disposal method. The Agency used data from the ``40 City Study'' for developing sludge contaminantlevels. Three sludge profiles were developed to represent sludges fromall publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities. The percent industrialinfluent of each POTW, as reported in the ``Needs Survey'', was used toassign one of the sludge quality profiles to each POTW. The three profilesrepresent three levels of pollutant contamination in sludges. First, atypical or expected level is set at the 50th percentile of the distributionof concentrations in the ``40 City Study''. Second, a more highly contaminatedlevel is set at the 90th percentile. Third, a very highly contaminatedlevel, representing a small number of facilities with very contaminatedsludges, is set at the 98th percentile. Before finalizing the assignmentof POTWs to a profile, adjustments were made to the percent industrialinfluent data to correct for inconsistently reported values in the ``NeedsSurvey.'' Once the adjustment was made, the typical sludge profile wasassigned to those POTWs having an industrial contribution of 17 percentor less (90 percent of the POTWs). POTWs with higher industrial contributions_i.e.,greater than 17 percent but less than 55 percent (accounting for approximately8 percent of the POTWs)_were assigned to the 90th-percentile category.Finally, those POTWs with an industrial contribution greater than 55 percent(2 percent of the POTWs) were assigned to the 98th-percentile category.Baseline sewage sludge use and disposal costs were developed from severalsources. The most extensive data base was developed by SCS Engineers andpublished in ``Handbook for Estimating Sludge Disposal Costs at MunicipalWastewater Treatment Facilities'' (EPA 430/9-81-004). Table XI-2 presentssludge use and disposal costs for representative facility size categories.These costs include annualized capital and operation/maintenance costsfor each method and transportation of sludge to the use or disposal site,if applicable. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table XI-</T4>2._<T4>Baseline Disposal Costs By Disposal Practice</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">(Annual Disposal Costs Per Dry Metric Ton of Sludge)</ITAG><H1>POTW size (MGD)</H1><H1>Annual sludge generation per POTW (tons/yr)</H1><H1>Incineration</H1><H1>Distribution and marketing</H1><H1>Monofill</H1><H1>Dedicated land application</H1><H1>Crop application</H1><H1>Reclamation</H1><H1>Surface disposal \1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="21">($/dry metric ton \2\)<R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">0.1<D>22</D><D>\3\ na</D><D>813</D><D>301</D><D>279</D><D>238</D><D>636</D><D>238</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">0.5<D>111</D><D>2,422</D><D>458</D><D>183</D><D>196</D><D>179</D><D>356</D><D>179</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>445</D><D>772</D><D>326</D><D>245</D><D>205</D><D>176</D><D>312</D><D>176</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">14<D>3,116</D><D>283</D><D>163</D><D>83</D><D>57</D><D>46</D><D>173</D><D>46</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">128<D>28,478</D><D>153</D><D>147</D><D>55</D><D>42</D><D>42</D><D>161</D><D>42</D><F>\1\ Costs assumed to be similar to crop application.</F><F>\2\ 1987 dollars.</F><F>\3\ There are no POTWs using incineration in this size class.</F></ITAG></ITAG>The sludge quality profiles were used to determine compliance with theproposed regulations for each use and disposal method. Once a compliancestrategy is assumed, the associated compliance costs are estimated. Estimatedcosts of compliance are compared to the baseline costs to determine theincremental cost of complying with the criteria. The sum of the incrementalcosts and the costs associated with management practices and sludge testingare the total costs for each use and disposal method.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impacts for Land Application</ITAG>Land application is defined in Subpart B of the proposed regulations asthe application of liquid, dewatered, dried, or composted sludge to eitheragricultural or non-agricultural land. A more detailed discussion of landapplication and the various end uses is presented in Part IX of this preambleand in the RIA.The regulatory requirements pertaining to land application include pollutant-specificnumerical criteria and management practices. These criteria and managementpractices differ for agricultural and non-agricultural applications. Thecriteria for agricultural land limit both the application rate (the maximumamount of sludge that can be applied at one time to a unit area of land)and the pollutant loading rate (the maximum amount of a pollutant thatcan be applied to a unit area of land either during a calendar year orcumulatively). For non-agricultural land, the regulation defines maximumsewage sludge pollutant concentrations. Management practices include variousrestrictions on access to and use of land. These restrictions vary dependingon the level of pathogen reduction attained.Compliance with the regulation was estimated by comparing the numericalcriteria for both agricultural and non-agricultural land applications tothe three sludge quality profiles. Non-agricultural land appliers thatcould not meet the maximum pollutant concentrations, as well as agriculturalland appliers that could not meet either annual or cumulative applicationrates, were assumed to shift to another disposal method.The results of the analysis for typical sludge quality indicate compliancewith all of the criteria for agricultural land application. For the 90th-and 98th-percentile sludges to meet the criteria, sludge applications ratesare considered too low to be practically feasible. Therefore, the POTWsthat have been assigned to the 90th- and 98th-percentile sludge qualitiesare projected to be out of compliance with the agricultural land applicationcriteria. The results of the analysis for non-agricultural criteria indicatethat the maximum allowable concentrations can be met for the typical and90th-percentile sludge quality. Only the 98th-percentile sludge fails tomeet the non-agricultural land application criteria.The 266 POTWs that cannot meet the agricultural land application criteriaare assumed to shift to either non-agricultural land application (dedicatedsites), MSWLFs, or composting in combination with non-agricultural landapplication. The 12 POTWs that fail to meet the maximum concentration limitsfor non-agricultural land are assumed to shift to MSWLFs or to add compostingprocesses prior to dedicated land application. The total incremental costassociated with shifting agricultural ($7.0 million) and non-agricultural($1.0 million) land applications to alternative practices is $8.0 millionannually.Pathogen and vector attraction reduction and access and use restrictionsare not expected to result in any incremental costs for POTWs in this category.These management practices are thought to be currently required by existingState and Federal regulations. There is an estimated total annual costof $500,000 associated with pathogen testing for all POTWs applying sludgeto land. Because many POTWs perform vector attraction tests, the cost ofsuch testing is assumed to be negligible. Sludge testing and record keepingand monitoring are required for all POTWs applying sludge to both agriculturaland non-agricultural land. Those 25 POTWs shifting to co-disposal landfillwould not incur costs of sludge testing and record keeping and monitoring.The total annual cost of sludge testing is approximately $4.4 million.Record keeping and monitoring are estimated to cost $2.2 million annually.Thus, the total estimated compliance costs associated with land applicationare $15.2 million annually.The baseline risks associated with land application (i.e., the risks associatedwith current practice) are estimated to be 0.18 cancer cases and 42 casesof other health effects. The benefits of complying with the proposed regulationare expressed as reductions in the risk_the number of baseline cases thatare avoided. For land application, the benefits are estimated to be 0.06cancer cases avoided and 21 cases of other adverse health effects avoided.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impacts for Distribution and Marketing</ITAG>The proposed regulation defines distribution and marketing as the use ofsewage sludge or a product derived from sewage sludge (e.g., compostedsewage sludge) primarily as a soil amendment or fertilizer. The sludgeor product may be sold or given to users or distributed in containers,such as bags, or in bulk form. The end user and, therefore, the ultimateend use of the sewage sludge is usually not controlled (either directlyor indirectly through a contract or similar mechanism) by the POTW. Forpurposes of the RIA, distribution and marketing has been distinguishedfrom land application on the basis of whether or not the sludge has beencomposted. POTWs known to compost sewage sludge and the quantities of sewageknown to be composted were used to approximate the number of POTWs andvolumes of sludge involved in distribution and marketing.A total of 106 POTWs currently practice distribution and marketing. ThesePOTWs generate an estimated 705,500 metric tons of sewage sludge per year,roughly nine percent of the total sewage sludge generated in the UnitedStates annually.The proposed regulation defines maximum pollutant concentrations in thedistributed and marketed product as a function of application rates. Thepollutant concentrations of the 106 POTWs, as represented by sludge qualityprofiles, were compared to the regulatory limitations to determine maximumrates of application. Since composted sludge is mixed with bulking agentsbefore being distributed, the final concentration of pollution in compostedsludge was calculated using a dilution factor. The application rate analysisindicates that a typical quality sludge, when applied at 10 dry metrictons per hectare, complies with the maximum allowable concentrations. Forhigher pollutant concentrations, the application rates would be too limiting.Thus, the 35 POTWs associated with the 90th- and 98th-percentile sludgeare assumed to shift to alternative disposal methods.An estimated 70 percent of these 35 POTWs (25 POTWs) are expected to shiftto non-agricultural land application. These POTWs currently dispose oftheir sludge by using non-agricultural end uses, they either have somelevel of control or are expected to gain contractual control of the enduse of their sludge. The remaining 30 percent of the 35 POTWs are assumedto shift to incineration. The total incremental cost for these 10 POTWsto shift their current method to incineration is $7.1 million. This includes$180,000 for continuous monitoring and recording and a one-time cost of$130,000 for performance testing and air dispersion modeling.  Management practices required by the proposed regulation include preparinglabels and information sheets for the distributed sludge, testing sludge,and reducing pathogens. The level of pathogen reduction required by theregulation is assumed to be achieved when sewage sludge is properly composted.Thus, no incremental costs are expected for pathogen reduction in thiscase. The 71 POTWs that will continue distribution and marketing incura total cost of about $23,000 for labels or sheets. All 106 POTWs in thisdistribution and marketing category will test their sewage sludge at acost of $500,000 annually and will incur annual costs of $140,000 for recordkeeping and reporting annually. In sum, the total estimated compliancecosts for distribution and marketing are $7.8 million for the first yearand $7.7 million annually for subsequent years.  The baseline risks associated with distribution and marketing (i.e., therisks associated with current practice) are estimated to be 0.02 cancercases and 95 cases of other health effects. The benefits of complying withthe proposed regulation are expressed as reductions in the risk_the numberof baseline cases that are avoided. For distribution and marketing, thebenefits are estimated to be 0.02 cancer cases avoided and 56 cases ofother adverse health effects avoided.  <ITAG tagnum="84"> Regulatory Impacts For Monofills  </ITAG>As discussed in Part IX of the preamble, Subpart D of the proposed regulationsapply to landfills that are used only for the disposal of municipal wastewatersludge (monofills). The methods of landfilling sewage sludge and the basisfor regulatory requirements are discussed more fully in the RIA and inPart IX of this preamble. The following is a summary of the methodologyused in the RIA to assess the impact of the regulation on facilities disposingof sewage sludge in monofills.  The Agency has identified 49 POTWs that use or maintain monofills. ThesePOTWs account for approximately 100,000 metric tons of sewage sludge peryear (about one percent of the total sewage sludge generated in the UnitedStates).  To determine the number of POTWs in compliance with the proposed criteriafor monofills, each of the POTWs using monofills was assigned to one ofthe three sludge profiles based on the percent industrial contributionto each plant. The three sludge profiles were then compared to the maximumallowable sludge concentration specified in the proposed regulation formonofills overlying Class II ground waters. Although the proposed regulationspecifies separate criteria for Class I, and Class II and Class III groundwaters, the criteria for Class II were used for this analysis based onstudies indicating a high probability that existing monofills overlie ClassII ground waters. This comparison resulted in none of the 49 POTWs passingall of the pollutant limits for any sludge profile.  A POTW that does not meet the numerical criteria for one or more pollutantscan request that EPA run a computer model to generate criteria based onthe POTW's site characteristics. In the absence of the individual facilitydata required to demonstrate compliance by running a site-specific model,all plants failing to meet a regulation's numerical criteria were assumedto switch to a different method of sewage sludge disposal. The smallestfacilities (0.1 to 0.5 million gallons per day (mgd) model facilities)are assumed to shift to MSWLFs. The larger facilities, because of theirpotentially significant impact on municipal landfill capacity problems,are assumed to shift to incineration.  The estimated total incremental cost for the 19 smaller-size facilitiesto shift from monofills to MSWLFs is approximately $170,000 annually. Forthe 30 POTWs currently monofilling that are in the larger size classes,the incremental cost to shift to onsite incineration is estimated to be$24.3 million annually.  Those POTWs shifting to MSWLFs will not be required to test their sludgequality continually. But, the 30 facilities shifting to incineration willbe required to test for the pollutants specified in the proposed regulationas it pertains to incineration. The total cost associated with sludge testingfor these facilities is approximately $22,000 per year. In addition, thePOTWs shifting to incineration will have to perform continuous monitoring,record keeping, and reporting tasks at a cost of $600,000 annually. POTWsshifting to incineration will also incur a one-time cost of approximately$400,000 for performance testing and air dispersion modeling.  The total incremental compliance costs associated with sewage sludge monofillsfor the first year are $25.5 million annually. The annualized cost in subsequentyears are estimated to be $25.1 million.  The baseline risks associated with monofills (i.e., the risks associatedwith current practice) are estimated to be 0.02 cancer cases and 26 casesof other health effects. The benefits of complying with the proposed regulationare expressed as reductions in the risk_the number of baseline cases thatare avoided. For the monofill disposal practice, benefits are estimatedto be 0.02 cancer cases avoided and 26 cases of other health effects avoided. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impacts for Surface Disposal Sites  </ITAG>A surface disposal site is defined in the proposed regulation as an areaof land on which only sewage sludge is placed without vegetative or othercover and on which sewage sludge remains for a period of one year or longer.The Agency has identified 2,395 POTWs that use sewage sludge surface disposalsites for managing the disposal of their sludge. Most of these POTWs arein the smallest size categories (0.1 and 0.5 mgd) and generate approximately197,000 metric tons of sewage sludge per year, less than three percentof the total generated in the United States.  The proposed regulation defines maximum allowable pollutant concentrationsfor surface disposal sites. To determine the number of POTWs in compliancewith the proposed criteria, the three sludge quality profiles were comparedto the pollutant concentration limits defined in the regulation. Basedon this comparison, 25 POTWs with 98th-percentile sludge quality failedto meet the numerical limits for one or more pollutants. The 20 smallestfacilities that cannot meet the criteria are assumed to shift to MSWLFs.The five largest facilities that do not meet the criteria are assumed tocompost their sludge and land apply it to dedicated sites.  The total incremental cost for the smaller facilities to shift from sewagesludge surface disposal to MSWLFs is approximately $150,000 annually. Thetotal incremental cost for the larger facilities to apply composted sludgeto dedicated land is $1.2 million annually. Management practices requiredby the proposed regulations for surface disposal include sludge testing,record keeping and reporting, and pathogen and vector attraction reduction.Sludge testing required for all of the POTWs using surface disposal sitesis estimated to cost $2.3 million annually. The annual cost of record keepingand reporting is estimated to be $1.7 million. These POTWs will also incuran annual cost of $0.2 million to meet the pathogen and vector attractionreduction requirements. Other management practice requirements includeuse and access restrictions, runoff controls, and limits for methane gasgenerated. The costs for complying with these requirements are expectedto vary by site; some POTWs may already be subject to similar requirementsimposed by local or State authorities. The Agency does not have sufficientinformation to estimate the costs for methane control and for runoff requirementsand solicits comment on the compliance costs associated with all surfacedisposal site management practice requirements. For purposes of the proposedrulemaking, the Agency estimates the total incremental cost of compliancefor surface disposal to be $5.5 milllion, annually. The Agency has notyet estimated human health benefits for this method of disposal.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impacts for Incineration  </ITAG>A detailed discussion of sewage sludge incineration and the regulatoryrequirements pertaining to incineration can be found in Part IX of thispreamble. The following is a brief discussion of the methodology used inthe RIA for developing the compliance costs and risk estimates for incineration. The proposed regulation requires sewage sludge that is incinerated to meetpollutant limits for seven metals and for total hydrocarbons (THC). Compliancewith the proposed criteria is demonstrated in the RIA using a two-stepprocess. First, maximum concentration limits for the metals and for THCare calculated using the equations specified in the regulation. The maximumconcentration limits for the metals are based on the sludge feed rate andincinerator control efficiencies. For THC, the limits are based on thegas flow rate and a dispersion factor. All of the equation parameters usedto establish limitations, except for the sludge feed rates and the gasflow rates, are given in the regulation. If any of the pollutant concentrationsin the sludge of a POTW are above the calculated maximum concentrationvalues, the incinerator at that POTW is not in compliance. Compliance mustbe demonstrated through incinerator emissions testing and air dispersionmodeling.  Parameters provided by incinerator performance tests and computerized air-dispersionmodeling are used to calculate maximum allowable concentrations for metals.For THC, the air dispersion model is used to calculate the dispersion factor,which is used to re-calculate the equation given in the regulation. Ifcompliance is not achieved through these two steps, POTWs are assumed toupgrade the incinerator's pollution control equipment. For purposes ofthe RIA, the pass/fail analysis uses the 10th-percentile metal controlefficiency values specified in the regulation to determine how many facilitieswould have to test their facilities and conduct air dispersion modeling.Then, typical values were used as a proxy to determine the number of facilitiesthat would be out of compliance with the numerical limit after performancetesting and modeling.  EPA identified 169 POTWs that use 282 sewage sludge incinerators as a methodof disposal. These POTWs generate slightly more than 20 percent (1.7 milliondry metric tons per year) of the total municipal sewage sludge producedin the United States. For purposes of this analysis, 10 actual incinerationfacilities were selected as models to represent the variety of geographic,meteorological, and operating conditions relevant to all incineration facilities.Each of the 169 facilities is represented by the one facility in the groupof ten it most closely resembles in terms of location, stack parameters,and capacity.    The Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 prohibits the dumping of sewage sludgeinto ocean waters after December 1991. To account for the 400,000 dry metrictons of sewage sludge currently disposed of in ocean water, the 25 POTWsthat currently use this method have been included in the incineration category.The volume of sludge generated by these POTWs will eventually be coveredby today's proposed regulation. At present, incineration is the most likelydisposal method. The 25 POTWs were assigned to one of the 10 models aswere the other 169 POTWs currently incinerating their sewage sludge. Itis assumed that 34 additional incinerator units will be required. Therefore,for the purposes of the RIA, the Agency assumes 194 POTWs generating 2.1million metric dry metric tons of sewage sludge per year, using 316 sewagesludge incinerators.  Compliance costs were estimated using a two-stage process. First, an analysiswas performed to determine the number of facilities currently in compliancewith the proposed regulatory criteria. The three sludge quality profiles(previously discussed in the methodology section) formed the basis forcomparison to the criteria. Second, compliance costs were aggregated formonitoring, record keeping, other management practice modifications, performancetests, and pollution control systems.  When the sludge feed rates from the 10 model facilities were used to calculatethe maximum allowable pollutant concentration, all three of the sludgequality profiles exceeded the limits for several pollutants. All of theincinerator facilities are then assumed to incur the costs of emissiontesting and air dispersion modeling to demonstrate compliance. When maximumallowable concentrations are calculated using typical, rather than worst-case10th-percentile, removal efficiencies and dispersion factors (to providea better representation of site-specific conditions at the model plants),122 POTWs (with 219 incinerators) are projected to fail to meet the numericallimits for metals. Of these, 28 POTWs (with 61 incinerators) are also projectedto fail to meet hydrocarbon emissions requirements.  The cost of complying with the proposed regulation includes the costs ofmanagement practices required of all sewage sludge incinerator facilities,the costs of performance testing, and the costs of retrofit technologiesif facilities do not comply after performance tests and air dispersionmodeling. Management practices include sludge testing for regulated pollutantsand continuous monitoring of several incinerator parameters. Performancetesting costs include emissions testing and air dispersion modeling.  The total annual cost of sludge testing for all POTWs with incineratorsis approximately $180,000. The total incremental costs of monitoring andrecording (some facilities are believed to have monitoring devices in placeto meet New Source Performance Standards requirements already) are estimatedto be $4.1 million annually. These costs reflect annualized capital costsplus annual operating and maintenance expenses. Record keeping and reportingis estimated to cost $350,000 annually. Thus, the total annual costs formanagement practice requirements are $4.6 million.  The total costs associated with performance testing for 169 POTWs are $2.6million. Theoretically, these costs are one-time expenditures by all POTWsthat want to show compliance through performance tests and air dispersionmodeling and avoid the cost of retrofit pollution control devices.  A total of 219 incinerator units are projected to incur the cost of upgradingtheir air pollution controls. Aggregate costs were estimated for the followingthree retrofit technology options to control metals emissions; (1) Wetelectrostatic precipitators (ESPs); (2) fabric filters; and (3) dry scrubberswith fabric filters. Removal efficiency data for these technologies arevery limited. The Agency has obtained and evaluated several studies ofthese technologies as applied to municipal solid waste combusters, buthas no comparable studies of sewage sludge incinerators. Still, EPA believesthat improved incinerator performance is achievable with the addition ofthese air pollution control devices. In the absence of better information,however, the Agency is unable to differentiate among the three retrofittechnologies for purposes of assigning an improved removal efficiency.In order to estimate costs for this rulemaking, installation of wet ESPswas assumed to be appropriate for all incinerators that fail to meet thecriteria for metals.  Total annual incremental costs for the retrofit technologies include annualizedcapital costs, installation and engineering expenses, and yearly operationand maintenance costs. The total costs assuming all POTWs choose the wetESP option are $24.0 million annually. The costs associated with the additionof fabric filters are $21.5 million annually. The most expensive optionis the dry scrubber/fabric filter option, which is estimated to cost $186.2million annually. The 28 POTWs (with 61 incinerators) that are also estimatedto fail to meet hydrocarbon emission limits are assumed to require afterburnersto effect removal of hydrocarbons. The total annual cost of after-burnerswith heat exchangers (energy recovery system) for these POTWs is estimatedto be $72.6 million.  The aggregate compliance costs associated with incineration for the firstyear, including management practice costs, performance testing costs, andcosts of all of the wet ESP retrofit technology, are $103.8 million. Theperformance testing is a one-time cost. The annualized costs in subsequentyears are estimated at $101.2 million.  The baseline risks associated with incineration (i.e., the risks associatedwith current practice) are estimated to be 12.0 cancer cases and 5,976cases of other health effects. The benefits of complying with the proposedregulation are expressed as reductions in the risk_the number of baselinecases that are avoided. For incineration, the benefits are estimated tobe 9.4 cancer cases avoided and 5,163 cases of other adverse health effectsavoided, for a total of 5,172.4 disease cases avoided.<ITAG tagnum="84">Pretreatment</ITAG>One section of the RIA is a separate analysis of the potential for applicationof industrial pretreatment as a compliance option for the proposed sewagesludge regulations. The assumption here is that stricter enforcement andrequirements for pretreatment (beyond the categorical standards for indirectdischargers) would reduce the amount of pollutants entering the POTW and,consequently, would reduce the amount of pollutants in the sludge. In theRIA, the pretreatment case studies are used to determine whether compliancewith the proposed regulation could be achieved through tighter pretreatmentcontrols on categorical dischargers rather than shifts to alternative disposalmethods.To date, EPA has analyzed eight POTWs to determine the effect of stricterpretreatment measures on a POTW's ability to comply with the sludge disposalcriteria. The eight POTWs were selected on the basis of data availability,while also trying to cover a variety of geographic regions, sludge disposalpractices, and mix of contributing industries. Of the eight case studies,two POTWs use incineration, one uses a monofill, one uses a MSWLF, threeuse land application, and one uses ocean disposal for sludge disposal.The case study POTWs range in size from 2 to 300 mgd and the percent ofindustrial influent ranges from 4 to 52 percent. Fourteen industry segmentsand eight pollutants were included in each case study.The case studies consider the effect of categorical pretreatment standardsand, when applicable, more stringent technologies. At each POTW, the annualloading rates of several pollutants were estimated for each industrialcontributor. Then, the reduction in pollutant loadings was estimated forthe additional control provided by pretreatment. The major sources of informationfor pretreatment technologies and their pollutant reductions were the technicalsupport documents for the effluent guidelines covering each industry. Pollutantreductions as a result of stricter pretreatment will vary for each POTWdepending on the types and sizes of the industrial contributors.The results of the case studies show that only one of the eight facilitiescan achieve compliance for all pollutants if additional pretreatment bycategorical industries is achieved. This POTW uses land application todispose of its sewage sludge. For the POTWs that incinerate and monofilltheir sewage sludge, the criteria in the proposed regulations are stringentenough that even substantial reductions in certain pollutant levels wereinsufficient to attain compliance. The general conclusion of this analysisis that significant reductions in pollutants can be achieved by strictpretreatment, but that compliance with the sludge disposal criteria maynot necessarily be attained through pretreatment actions alone.The case study analysis and its conclusions are limited by the site-specificnature of the analysis, making it difficult to extrapolate results to allPOTWs. The results are dependent on the type and size of the dischargers.The analysis is also limited in that the only improvements in sludge qualitywere among the categorical dischargers. Further, the pollutant removalswere limited to those contaminants for which categorical pretreatment standardshave been established.This study of pretreatment also raises another question that may affectthe Agency's policy on sewage sludge disposal. The issue is whether industrialpretreatment will merely shift pollutant problems from the sludge at thePOTWs to the sludge at industrial facilities. The Agency plans to studythis question before promulgating the final technical regulations and invitescomment on the issue.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reduction In Risk</ITAG>In addition to the costs associated with the proposed regulations, theRIA also discusses the benefits that can be attributed to control of sewageuse and disposal. The presentation in the RIA is limited to a summary descriptionof the methodology used to calculate benefits and a summary of the results.A detailed description of the methodological approach and findings arepresented in a companion document entitled ``Aggregate Risk Assessmentof Municipal Sewage Sludge''.The risk assessment used in the analysis follows the process outlined bythe National Academy of Sciences. The assessment begins with a hazard identificationand a source assessment and continues with fate and transport estimates,exposure assessments, pharmokinetics analysis, and dose response assessments.These components are used to develop the changes in health, measured asmorbidity and mortality.The first step in identifying the benefits from the proposed sewage sludgeregulation involves estimating the baseline human health risks of sludgeuse or disposal. These health risks are presented as cases of cancer andother health effects, such as lead-related diseases. The key inputs forestimating baseline risks include source (POTW) information, sludge contaminants,and ultimate disposal site characteristics. Baseline risks from the sludgedisposal practices are characterized based on the sludge quality profilespresented earlier, the quantity of sludge generated by each POTW, and thefate and transport of the pollutants subsequent to disposal, dependingon a number of different environments that vary with each disposal practice.On the basis of the above inputs, the analysis estimates the potentialpathways of human exposure and models the fate and transport of the keysludge constituents for these primary pathways. The study then estimatesthe potential population exposed. This information, along with dose-responsedata for each of the sludge contaminants of concern, is used to characterizebaseline human health risks.Once baseline risks are derived, risk estimates are recalculated basedon the level of control imposed by the proposed regulation. The regulatorycompliance strategies for the health risk assessment parallel those usedto estimate the compliance cost. The same risk assessment process is usedto derive the change in the baseline risk as a result of each control optionby use or disposal method. This change in the baseline is the measure ofbenefit. The estimates of the benefits are presented in the analysis foreach use of disposal method and are expressed as the number of diseasecases avoided. These disease cases include cancer cases avoided, but theresults of the analysis also specify non-cancer human health effects thatare avoided as a result of the proposed regulation.Based on the analysis, the Agency estimates the benefits for this proposedrule to be a reduction of 9.5 cancer cases and 5,266 cases of other healtheffects. The quantitative benefits for each disposal practice are presentedearlier in this part of the preamble and in Table XI-1.There are a number of limitations that affect the estimates of risk reduction,including the exclusion of certain exposure pathways, contaminants, andhealth effects. The analysis is also limited by the reliability of sludgequality data, the uncertainty of the distribution of disposal practicesby POTWs, and the lack of ability to account for population growth andmobility.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Effects</ITAG>The proposed regulation is expected to result in certain environmentalbenefits, in addition to the benefits associated with reducing the incidenceof adverse human health effects. These environmental benefits are an outgrowthof the general reduction in the amount and toxicity of sludge that is usedor disposed of by ways damaging to the environment, particularly that whichis placed in environmentally sensitive areas. These environmental benefitsconsist mainly of improved habitats for wildlife and other species in theareas where methods of disposal and use practices occur.For example, the regulations affecting land application of sewage sludgeare likely to result in some level of improvement in the quality of waterbodies in the watershed for these areas. The management practices specifiedin the regulation provide for set-backs from water bodies. This will tendto decrease runoff of pollutants, thereby improving water quality in thearea's streams, rivers, or lakes. Similarly, monofills and surface disposalsites are prohibited from wetland areas. Together, these improvements,while they may be small, will nevertheless benefit the aquatic speciespresent and other species in the food-chain that are dependent on the waterbodies and wetlands for food (e.g., waterfowl). To some extent, sport fishermenand hunters are likely to gain some benefit due to the improved habitatsfor fish and wildlife.Changes in incineration practices are also likely to provide some marginalenvironmental gain for wildlife. In addition, emissions reductions in thevicinities of the incinerators may reduce particulate and other chemicaldeposition on buildings, automobiles, and structures, providing for a reductionin the extent to which these items are damaged by air pollution. Commericalfarms and home gardens located in areas affected by deposition from sludgeincinerators may experience some increase in crop vitality due to lowerlevels of pollutants that are discharged.<ITAG tagnum="84">Small Entity Analysis</ITAG>In addition to the analytical requirements imposed by the statute and byExecutive Order 12291, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires all Federalagencies to analyze the impact of a proposed regulation on small businesses,small governmental jurisdictions, and small organizations. The purposeof this analysis is to determine whether the proposed regulation will havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposesof the proposed sludge regulation, the Agency defines small entity as asmall POTW. The size distinction is based on daily influent flow, whichis a frequently used parameter for describing the size of a POTW. Thereis also a direct relationship between the amount of flow and the quantityof sludge generated.Throughout the RIA, costs have been estimated for five size classes ofPOTWs represented by 0.1 mgd, 0.5 mgd, 2 mgd, 14 mgd, and 128 mgd. Forthe purpose of evaluating the impact of the sludge regulation on smallentities, a POTW in the 0.1- or 0.5-mgd size class is defined as a smallentity. The Agency solicits comment on this definition. Eighty-one percent(4,337 POTWs) of the POTWs covered by the proposed regulations are in thesetwo size classes. The majority (98 percent) of these small entities practiceland application or use surface disposal sites.The small POTWs will not incur significant costs if their sludge is consideredto be of typical quality, which is the Agency's projection for approximately90 percent of all POTWs. In addition, the Agency has limited the complianceburden for small entities in the area of sludge testing. The proposed regulationsare tiered such that smaller POTWs are subject to less frequent monitoringand reporting requirements. Small entities make up 81 percent of all POTWssubject to the regulation, but only incur six percent of the total compliancecosts for the proposed regulations. The total annual compliance costs perPOTW averaged over all disposal practices are about $1,600 per year forPOTWs in the 0.1-mgd size class and about $3,000 per year for those inthe 0.5-mgd size class.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>The Agency has initiated an information collection effort through the NationalSewage Sludge Survey. The survey collects data that will be used to developthe final numerical limits by testing the assumptions on which those limitsare based and to better estimate the effects of this regulation on themethods of sewage sludge use and disposal. Approximately 470 POTWs areexpected to participate by completing a questionnarie. In addition, anyother treatment works interested in answering the survey should call orwrite for a copy of the questionnaire, as directed in the ``For FurtherInformation, Contact'' section at the beginning of this preamble.As discussed earlier, the RIA was limited by data constraints in severalareas. Therefore, the cost and benefit results are partly based on a numberof assumptions about sewage sludge use and disposal. In an effort to increasethe accuracy of the Agency's projections and improve the analysis, EPAis soliciting comments on the following issues concerning the RIA. (Theseissues are described in detail in the appropriate segment of the RIA.)<ITAG tagnum="81">Number of POTWs and Volumes of Sludge</ITAG>As part of the National Sewage Sludge Survey, the Agency is collectinginformation on the number of POTWs, the volume of sludge currently generated,and the amount going to each method of use or disposal. As part of thisrequest for comment, however, the Agency further solicits information onthese estimates.<ITAG tagnum="81">Multiple Practices</ITAG>The RIA simplifies current estimates by assigning a single use or disposalmethod to each facility, although the Agency is aware that some POTWs usemultiple methods of use or disposal. The Agency requests comment on theextent to which multiple methods are being used and the extent of errorthat might be associated with the RIA's simplification.<ITAG tagnum="81">Small Entity Analysis</ITAG>The RIA includes a small entity analysis. The Agency solicits comment onthe definition of small entity, both in terms of using the flow size ofa POTW as the means to define small and also on the levels selected todefine small POTWs for regulatory purposes.<ITAG tagnum="81">Baseline Costs</ITAG>All of the compliance cost estimates are based on baseline costs for eachof the methods of use or disposal. The major source of these baseline costswas an engineering study published by the Agency in 1981. The Agency solicitscomment on the accuracy of these baseline costs and requests updates onany of the cost values that have changed.<ITAG tagnum="81">Privately Owned Treatment Works</ITAG>The RIA is limited to the impact that may be incurred by POTWs, but theregulation applies to all treatment works. The Agency requests commenton the number, location, size, and sludge use or disposal methods at privatelyowned treatment works.<ITAG tagnum="81">Pretreatment</ITAG>The Agency believes that industrial pretreatment will be a means of compliancefor many municipalities, but lacks sufficient information to make a quantitativeassessment of the number of POTWs that will use local limits, either aloneor with other compliance strategies, to comply with these regulations.Comment is requested on all aspects of industrial pretreatment as it pertainsto compliance with sewage sludge use and disposal limitations (e.g., theextent of industrial pretreatment as a means of compliance). The Agencyalso solicits suggestions or additional data to evaluate pretreatment asa means of compliance.<ITAG tagnum="81">Sludge Quality Data</ITAG>One of the more serious data limitations associated with the RIA is a lackof sludge quality data. As described above, the assumptions concerningthe concentrations of pollutants currently found in sewage sludge are criticalto many phases of the RIA's conclusions. One objective of the NationalSewage Sludge Survey, in its analytical sampling component, is to collectsludge quality information. Even in light of this planned data collectioneffort, the Agency requests comments on other sources of sludge qualitydata to use for comparative purposes and for verification. The Agency isalso requesting comment on how the sludge profiles are used to representsludge quality at individual treatment plants because, even when the samplingeffort is completed, some assignment of sampling results to actual facilitiesmay be required to conduct the Regulatory Impact Analysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">Site-Specific Factors and Compliance</ITAG>Another limitation of the RIA is an inability to assess compliance whensite-specific factors will be used to establish the regulatory limitations.For example, the regulatory limitations for monofills may be adjusted onthe bases of depth to ground water. The RIA does not account for such adjustments.Similarly, actual operating parameters at an incinerator may affect theallowable pollutant concentrations. The RIA accounts for conditions atten model facilities, but not for distinctions at individual locations.The Agency requests comments on the extent to which site-specific factorswill affect compliance.<ITAG tagnum="81">Cost for Monofills To Change Practices</ITAG>For monofills, the compliance cost estimates are based on the assumptionthat facilities unable to comply with the concentration limits will shifttheir disposal of sludge to a MSWLF or to incineration, depending on thesize of the facility. The Agency solicits comments on the reasonablenessof these presumed shifts in practice. Are suitable landfill sites available?What tipping fees would the POTW face to dispose of sewage sludge in aMSWLF? Would existing sewage sludge incinerators within reasonable distancesaccept sludge from this facility? Would sludge now disposed on monofillslikely to go to practices other than municipal landfills or incinerators?<ITAG tagnum="81">Distribution and Marketing Factors </ITAG>For distribution and marketing, the RIA used a limited amount of informationfrom POTWs to determine the final end use of the sewage sludge product(e.g., application to home gardens, parks, highway medians). While theNational Sewage Sludge Survey is designed to increase the accuracy of thisfinal end use information, the Agency is requesting comment on the distributionand marketing of sludge products among the end uses presented in the RIA.Also for distribution and marketing, the Agency is soliciting comment onthe shifts that are assumed for POTWs that would not comply with the sludgeapplication rates and pollutant concentrations. The RIA assumes variousshifts, depending on the size of the POTW, the quality of the sludge, andthe final end use. Comments are requested on the land availability assumptions,opportunity to control the final end use, and reasonableness of shiftsto alternatives. <ITAG tagnum="81">Land Application Cumulative Loading Notes </ITAG>The cumulative loading rates for land application were considered to be``passed'' if one application (i.e., 1 year) was possible. However, inthe results presented in the RIA, the lowest passing rate actually usedwas 10 years, which was based on the calculations specified in the regulationand on the sludge quality profiles used throughout the RIA. The Agencysolicits comment on the reaction of POTWs to cumulative loading rate limitations.How many years of application reflect common land application practices?Will a cumulative loading rate be interpreted differently than an annualloading rate? <ITAG tagnum="81">Incinerator Factors </ITAG>For incineration, site-specific conditions could significantly affect thelimitations for a particular facility (e.g., incinerator stack height andsludge feed rate). In the absence of more information, the RIA cannot projectcompliance for individual facilities. The Agency solicits comment on thevarious parameters that affect compliance (i.e., meeting more of the individualpollutant limitations, given the conditions at and around the facility).The analysis of incineration relies on various air pollution control devicesas the treatment technologies that facilities could use to comply withemissions limitations. Several retrofit technologies (e.g., wet ESPs, fabricfilters) were used to estimate compliance costs (e.g., effectiveness ofretrofit technologies in reducing the pollutant emissions). The Agencysolicits removal efficiency data for the technologies used in the RIA andfor other air pollution control devices. EPA also requests comments onthe cost estimates used in the RIA for installing and operating these treatmentsystems.<ITAG tagnum="81">Surface Disposal Site Management Practices</ITAG>For surface disposal sites, the Agency solicits comment on management practicesthat facilities use to control access, prevent runoff, reduce pathogens,and control the generation of methane gas. EPA has found that the use ofsurface disposal sites is not well-documented. The Agency requests informationon the number of facilities using surface disposal sites (as defined inthis proposed rule), the volume of sludge disposed of, and expected compliancestrategies if the pollutant concentration limits are not met. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The public reporting burden for the collection of information imposed bythis proposal, averaged over a 3-year period, is estimated to be 336 hoursfor POTWs land-applying sewage sludge, 981 hours for POTWs distributingand marketing sewage sludge, 152 hours for POTWs disposing of sewage sludgeon surface disposal sites, and 4,751 hours for POTWs incinerating sewagesludge. The average time per response per POTW is estimated to be 408.9hours. The information collection requirements have been submitted forapproval to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>An Information Collection Request document has been preparedby EPA (ICR No. 1489) and a copy may be obtained from Eric Strassler, InformationPolicy Branch; EPA; 401 M Street, SW. (PM-223); Washington, DC 20460 orby calling (202) 382-2709. Submit comments on these requirements to EPAand: Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs; OMB; 726 Jackson Place,NW; Washington, DC 20503 marked ``Attention: Desk Office for EPA''. Thefinal rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the informationcollection requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">PART XII: SUMMARY OF ISSUES AND DATA REQUESTED</ITAG>In the foregoing preamble discussion, EPA solicited public comment on abroad range of issues and requested specific data and information. TheAgency believes that it has provided sufficient information in the preambleand in technical support documents to support today's proposal. Publiccomments and data and information submitted to the Agency will be thoroughlyevaluated to refine the proposal. In addition during the comment period,EPA will solicit the assistance of experts both inside and outside theAgency in the review of the scientific and technical bases of the rule.If new information alters the premises of today's proposal, the Agencywill publish the new information along with a revised proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.The broad issues, data and information discussed in the preamble are summarizedbelow and are organized into the following categories: principles usedin developing today's proposal, coverage of the rule, methodologies, levelof protection, establishment of the standards, related requirements, andimpacts.<ITAG tagnum="84">Principles Used in Developing Today's Proposal</ITAG>The fundamental principles underlying today's proposal follow.<ITAG tagnum="81">Expand the Standards Later</ITAG>While not delaying the proposal to wait for more current information, theAgency is conducting a National Sewage Sludge Survey, as well as gatheringother data to assist in revising and expanding the scope of today's proposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">Coordinate With Other Programs</ITAG>Use the regulatory standards and tools developed for other Agency programs,where appropriate, in developing standards for a use or disposal method.<ITAG tagnum="81">Control Sludge Quality</ITAG>Set numerical limits on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis to prevent the contaminationof sewage sludge before it is used or disposed of and to create incentivesfor treatment works to generate clean sludge.<ITAG tagnum="81">Emphasize Waste Reduction and the Beneficial Reuse of Sewage Sludge</ITAG>By reducing the generation of sewage sludge (e.g., by home composting offood scraps rather than putting them down a garbage disposal) and by creatingincentives for the generation of clean sludge, treatment works have moreoptions to manage their sewage sludge beneficially.<ITAG tagnum="81">Preserve a Local Community's Choice of a Use or Disposal Method</ITAG>Although the Agency's preference is for local communities to reuse sludgefor its nutrient and soil conditioning properties of sewage sludge, theClean Water Act (CWA) reserves the choice of a use or disposal method tolocal communities. However, the protection of public health and the environment,where risks are significant, still dictates stringent pollutant limits.Therefore, some communities may not be able to continue with their currentmethod of disposal, if, for example, a monofill is located over Class Iground water.<ITAG tagnum="81">Base the Rule on Minimizing Risks to Individuals</ITAG>In cases where exposure to pollutants is likely to be high or where thereare significant scientific uncertainties, pollutant limits are derivedusing exposure assessment models designed to protect the most exposed individual,plant, or animal (MEI). If a use or disposal method poses insignificantrisk of pollutant exposure to individuals through food, water, or air,base the numerical limits on ``current sludge quality.''<ITAG tagnum="81">Propose Reasonable Standards</ITAG>To protect human health and the environment from reasonably anticipatedadverse effects of each pollutant, design an approach that accounts fordata inadequacies, but does not necessarily protect against every conceivablecombination of adverse case conditions.<ITAG tagnum="81">Propose an Implementable Rule</ITAG>Balance the flexibility associated with site-specific analyses againstthe simplicity of national pollutant limits.<ITAG tagnum="81">Solicit Comment on a Wide Range of Issues </ITAG>In addition to explaining the proposal, the preamble should discuss alternativeapproaches that have been used by other Agency programs regulating pollutantsin the various media and that were considered in developing the rule. EPA is soliciting comment on these principles which it used in developingtoday's proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">Coverage of the Rule </ITAG>The CWA recognizes that the development of standards for the use and disposalof sewage sludge is an iterative process. In section 405(d)(2)(C), theAdministrator is directed to review the regulations from time-to-time,but no less frequently than every two years, to identify additional pollutantsand to promulgate regulations for those pollutants. After evaluating atotal of 50 pollutants, EPA is proposing specific numerical limits for28 pollutants in one or more use or disposal methods. The National SewageSludge Survey will identify additional pollutants for the Agency to evaluate.However, are there pollutants that are not included in today's proposalwhich commenters believe should be evaluated immediately?EPA did not evaluate the initial list of 50 pollutants for each use ordisposal method because the Agency's expert advisory group did not believethat certain pollutants would interfere with a particular method of useor disposal. However, without evaluating whether or not a pollutant interfereswith a particular disposal method, EPA could not authorize a removal creditwhen sewage sludge is disposed of by that method. In future rulemakings,the Agency plans to evaluate the interference of a pollutant with eachmethod of use or disposal. The Agency is soliciting comment on the needto re-run its models for all the pollutants in every use or disposal methodif a human health criterion exists. The proposal does not set standards for sewage sludge that is generatedor treated by privately owned treatment facilities that treat domesticsewage along with the facilities' industrial wastewater. At this time,the Agency does not believe that it has sufficient information on the characteristicsof industrial sludge to use the models that were developed for municipalsewage sludge. However, are there types of industrial sludge, such as foodprocessing wastes with a high organic content, that are sufficiently similarto municipal sewage sludge for the Agency to establish standards with themodels developed for municipal sewage sludge? The data needed to determinethe appropriateness of the exposure assessment models for industrial sludgeinclude the viscosity, density, moisture content, and organic carbon contentof the sludge. Generally, when sewage sludge is incincerated, the sewage sludge is firedin sewage sludge-only facilities. The Agency is examining the co-firingof sewage sludge with solid waste in connection with the development ofnew source performance standards for municipal waste combustors. Undersection 405(d) of the CWA, should the Agency set separate standards forsewage sludge fired with solid waste, even though sewage sludge is unlikelyto be a significant portion of the waste fed into a municipal waste combustor?On the other hand, should the Agency develop standards under both section111 of the CAA and section 405(d) of the CWA? Standards were proposed underthe joint authority of sections 4004 and 4010 of RCRA and section 405(d)of the CWA in the case of the disposal of sewage sludge in municipal solidwaste landfills (MSWLFs). The Agency is proposing standards for five disposal practices. Are thereother methods of using or disposing of sewage sludge that the rule doesnot, but should cover? <ITAG tagnum="84">Methodologies </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Exposure Assessment Models </ITAG>The Agency developed a series of mathematical expressions or algorithmsto simulate the movement of a pollutant into and through the environmentto an MEI. These models were designed to calculate the long-term exposureto an individual, plant, or animal. Were the most appropriate models usedor are there other more appropriate models that the Agency should considerprior to promulgating pollutant limits? How should the models EPA usedbe revised? In a rule such as this, is it appropriate to evaluate onlythe long-term effects or should the models be modified to also considershort-term fluctuations in exposure? The technical support documents for land application, landfilling, andincineration list the values used in the models. Do these values supporta rule that is ``adequate to protect public health and the environmentfrom any reasonably anticipated adverse effect of each pollutant''? TheAgency is soliciting additional data in refining today's proposal. The Agency used the accepted approach of evaluating the effect of 70 yearsof continuous exposure to an individual who receives the maximum exposureexcept for a child ingesting soil. For a child ingesting soil, the assumptionis that the ingestion will occur over a 5-year period from the ages onethrough six. Are the scenarios for the MEI reasonable? Do they reflectscenarios which could occur? For example, is it reasonable to assume thatfor the application of sewage sludge to agricultural land that the MEIresides on the land where the sewage sludge is applied? For distributionand marketing, the MEI scenario is a rural non-farm family growing 60 percentof their fruits and vegetables in a sludge-amended home garden. For monofills,the assumption is that the MEI drinks 2 liters of water from a well locatedat the property boundary of the monofill and inhales 20 cubic meters ofair a day while standing in the center of the plume at the property boundaryof the monofill. For the incineration scenario, the MEI is located in thepeak concentration of the plume, inhaling 20 cubic meters of air a day.In addition to the MEI, each of the exposure assessment models has keyparameters that affect the limit that is calculated. EPA is interestedin comments on key parameters which may not have, but should have beenconsidered. The key parameters on which the Agency is particularly interestedin receiving public comment follow. <ITAG tagnum="81">Land Application for Agricultural Lands </ITAG>The key parameters for the land application of sewage sludge on agriculturallands include the following: andbullet; The land receiving the sewage sludge will be converted to residentialhome gardens within 5 years; andbullet; The sludge is mixed with soil to a depth of 15 centimeters (6inches); andbullet; The background concentration of metals in the soil correspondsto the average soil concentration of rural agricultural land; andbullet; Over time, metals are absorbed by plants at the same rate as theywere when first applied to the soil; andbullet; Eight percent of the food intake of a grazing animal consistsof a sludge-soil mixture; andbullet; The most highly sensitive plants and animals were used in theanalysis; and andbullet; The ingestion rate of 0.1 grams per day for 5 years was used inanalyzing the effect of children eating soils (as compared to 0.5-5.0 gramsfor a child exhibiting PICA behavior).<ITAG tagnum="81">Distribution and Marketing</ITAG>The key parameters for the distribution and marketing of sewage sludgeinclude the following:andbullet; Neither the raising of animals for human consumption nor the growingof feed crops for animals raised for human consumption were consideredfor this home garden scenario;andbullet; The background concentration of metals in the soil correspondsto the average soil concentration of rural agricultural land; andandbullet; The sludge is mixed with soil to a depth of 15 centimeters (6inches).<ITAG tagnum="81">Monofills</ITAG>The key parameters for the disposal of sewage sludge in monofills includethe following:andbullet; All metals go into solution and leach to the ground water;andbullet; For Class I ground water, the point of compliance is the pointat which the leachate reaches the ground water_the depth to ground wateris assumed to be zero;andbullet; For Class II and Class III ground water, the point of complianceis 150 meters (450 feet) from the point of entry_the depth to ground wateris assumed to be one meter;andbullet; The effect of synthetic liners was not considered in the analysis;andandbullet; The rate at which pollutants volatilize into the atmosphere isnot attenuated by the adsorption or degradation of pollutants.<ITAG tagnum="81">Incineration</ITAG>The key parameters of the incineration of sewage sludge include the following:andbullet; The metal control efficiencies of incinerators were assumed tocorrespond to the 10 percent worst-control efficiencies of the sewage sludgeincinerators in EPA's data base;andbullet; All incinerator emissions include the same constituents; andandbullet; Short-term fluctuations of operations were not examined.<ITAG tagnum="81">Other Exposure Assessment Models</ITAG>The Agency is developing exposure assessment models for sewage sludge placedon surface disposal sites and for the development of health-based pathogenand vector attraction reduction requirements.In developing the model for surface disposal sites, the Agency is solicitingadditional data on the location and size of surface disposal sites. TheAgency is also soliciting data on the key differences in the sewage sludgedisposed of in monofills, on dedicated non-agricultural land, and on surfacedisposal sites (e.g., the viscosity, density, solids content, and pollutantconcentrations). In addition, the Agency is soliciting information on themanagement practices, if any, generally associated with surface disposalsites. Comments are requested on the proposed definition of ``surface disposalsites.'' Does it make sense to differentiate surface disposal sites fromdedicated land application and from monofills?For pathogens, the Agency is soliciting data on the movement of pathogenicorganisms from a sewage sludge matrix and the attenuation of the organismsby dilution, temperature, moisture, sunlight, pH, presence of antagonisticorganisms, and soil structure. In addition, the Agency is requesting informationon reliable measurement techniques for pathogenic organisms. Also, dataare requested on the relationship between infectious dose and disease.<ITAG tagnum="81">Methodology for Evaluating the Aggregate Effects of Current Use andDisposal Practices</ITAG>EPA did not look at the effects of concurrent exposure to more than onesource of sewage sludge-borne pollutants. The Agency is interested in evaluatingmodels that would take into account multiple routes of exposure and isrequesting that information on such models be submitted to EPA as partof the comments on today's proposal.The Agency relied on data from ``Fate of Priority Pollutants in PubliclyOwned Treatment Works'' (the ``40 City Study'', Reference number 36) asthe primary source of information on the pollutant concentrations in municipalsewage sludge. Recognizing the deficiencies in the data base, the Agencyhas initiated a National Sewage Sludge Survey to provide current and reliabledata that will improve our analyses of risks of using and disposing ofsewage sludge and, consequently, of appropriate pollutant limits. Giventhe lack of data on the quality of sewage sludge that is used or disposedof by a particular method, was it reasonable for the Agency to assume thata facility's sewage sludge corresponded to the 50th-, 90th-, or 98th-percentileconcentrations in the ``40 City Study''? Was it reasonable to assign the50th-, 90th-, and 98th-percentile sludges to facilitates based on the industrialcomponent of wastewater flow?Until the Agency develops exposure assessment models for pathogens andfor sewage sludge disposal on surface disposal sites, quantitative assessmentsof the effects of sewage sludge use and disposal will be incomplete. However,the Agency does not believe that surface disposal sites measurably increasethe incidence of adverse human health or environmental effects. The Agencyis interested in evaluating any documented evidence that pathogenic diseaseshave been transmitted through the application of sewage sludge to the landor through the disposal of sewage sludge in monofills or on surface disposalsites. The Agency is interested in approaches others may have used in evaluatinghuman health and environmental effects of disposing of sewage sludge onsurface disposal sites.In evaluating the effects of current methods of sewage sludge use and disposal,the Agency used average or typical conditions. Was this an appropriateapproach or should the Agency consider other approaches in determiningthe effects of sewage sludge-borne pollutants? Are the assumptions thatthe Agency made in identifying typical conditions reasonable? Was it reasonableto assume complete mixing of food crops in the national market place andthat sewage sludge would be applied only once to farm land? Are the percentagesof food consumed from home gardens reasonable? Is it reasonable to usethe rate normal children ingest dirt rather than the rate associated witha PICA child? Did the Agency select the appropriate-sized POTWs and theappropriated hydrogeologic characteristics in modeling the 49 monofills?Was it appropriate for the Agency to allocate all 194 sewage sludge incineratorfacilities to one of 10 modeled facilities? Is the 25th-percentile metalcontrol efficiency reasonable to use in evaluating the effects of metalemissions from incinerators? Given the lack of data on total hydrocarbonemissions, did the Agency use an appropriate approach in allocating theresults from four tests to the 194 sewage sludge incinerator facilities?The Agency is interested in alternative approaches that it should considerin estimating the number of cancer cases, in estimating the number of individualsexposed to concentrations above a reference dose (RfD), and in estimatingthe effects from exposure to lead. In addition, the Agency is interestedin approaches that may have been developed to evaluate ecological effects,including farm economic losses caused by plant or animal toxicity.<ITAG tagnum="84">Level of Human Health and Environmental Protection</ITAG>In setting numerical limits with the exposure assessment models, EPA generallyis using existing Agency criteria, where they exist, to ascertain thatthe numerical limits do not exceed human health criteria. Where the Agencyhas not published human health criteria, the approach used in this proposalwas to select the values in the Agency's computerized Integrated Risk InformationSystem (IRIS). Are there more appropriate human health criteria that theAgency should have evaluated? Was it appropriate for the Agency to assumethat, if a value was not listed in IRIS, there was no human health criterionfor a pollutant and to defer consideration of the pollutant until IRISlisted a human health criterion? In developing a human health criterionfor lead, when food grown on sludge-amended soils is ingested, did theAgency make the appropriate assumption on the allowable food intake? Dothe assumptions the Agency used in developing an exposure scenario (e.g.,MEI is an adult male, 2.5 percent of whose diet is from food grown on sludge-amendedsoils) provide an adequate margin of safety for any uncertainties in thedata? Or are these assumptions so limiting that they preclude the beneficialreuse of sewage sludge and force sewage sludge to be incinerated?The Agency selected risk specific doses corresponding to an incrementalcarcinogenic risk of 1x10^\4\ for the land application of sewage sludgeto agricultural land, for the distribution and marketing of sewage sludge,and for the disposal of sewage sludge in monofills and a carcinogenic riskof 1x10^5 for the incineration of sewage sludge. The Agency selected alower risk for the incineration of sewage sludge in order to compensatefor postponing the examination of indirect pathways of exposure (i.e.,deposition of emissions on plants and their subsequent ingestion), becauseof the number of people who may be exposed to high emission levels (51million), and because of the high levels of maximum individual and aggregaterisk posed by incineration. Do the projected benefits (i.e., increase inhealth cases avoided) merit a lower risk level? Given the assumptions usedin establishing the doses, the assumptions used in the exposure assessmentmodels, and the projected risks posed by each use and disposal method arethe carcinogenic risk levels and the RfDs for non-carcinogenic pollutantsadequate to protect public health ``from any reasonable anticipated adverseeffect from each pollutant.'' EPA, in particular, requests comments onits approach to establishing a cancer potency value for total hydrocarbons.In selecting environmental criteria, the Agency used the most sensitiveplant and animal toxicity values reported in the scientific literature.Are the plants and animals that the Agency used appropriate? By selectingthe toxicity values for the most sensitive species, is the Agency settingmore stringent pollutant limits than is necessary to adequately protecthuman health and the environment when sewage sludge is applied to agriculturallands? When field data were not available, was it appropriate for the Agencyto base numerical limits on the phytotoxicity pathway using pot studieswith sludge spiked with metal salts? Are there data on wild plant and animalspecies that the Agency should evaluate?<ITAG tagnum="84">Establishment of the Standards</ITAG>EPA is proposing standards that include numerical pollutant limits, managementpractices, and other requirements that define the level of management controlthat treatment works, users and disposers must exercise over their sewagesludge to preclude adverse human health and environmental effects. Thestandards are established separately for each method of use or disposal.In establishing the numerical limits, the Agency is proposing two approaches.The Agency is proposing to use the exposure assessment models to calculatepollutant limits when sewage sludge is applied to agricultural lands, distributedand marketed, disposed of in monofills, and incinerated because these practicesare likely to result in high levels of pollutant exposure to an MEI orbecause there are significant scientific uncertainties about the effectof the disposal practice. The other approach is to use ``current sludgequality'' (i.e., the 98th-percentile pollutant concentrations shown inthe ``40 City Study'') for the application of sewage sludge to non-agriculturallands and for disposing of sewage sludge on surface disposal sites. TheAgency is using the ``current sludge quality'' approach for the later twopractices because of its belief that human dietary exposure is unlikelyto result from these practices.Are these the appropriate premises for establishing the pollutant limits?Are there other premises that the Agency should consider? Is the Agencycorrect in assuming the implausibility of human dietary exposure, eitherthrough food or water, when sewage sludge is applied to non-agriculturallands or disposed of on surface disposal sites? Has the Agency over-estimatedthe amount of pollutant exposure likely to occur from the other practiceswarranting use of the 98th-percentile pollutant concentrations for othermethods of use or disposal. Will the numerical limits or the definitionof a use or disposal practice inhibit the beneficial reuse of sewage sludge(e.g., prohibiting the raising of crops for human consumption on non-agriculturallands)?Will the 98th-percentile pollutant concentrations adequately protect theenvironment? The Agency's analysis shows that if 50 metric tons of sewagesludge were placed on a hectare of non-agricultural land, toxicity valuesfor plants (lettuce) would be exceeded for copper and zinc at the 98th-percentilepollutant concentrations and toxicity values for predators (ducks) eatingsoil biota (earthworms) would be exceeded for lead at the 98th-percentilepollutant concentration. Because these are the most sensitive species,is the Agency correct in assuming that any adverse environmental effectis unlikely to be significant?In calculating the numerical limits with the exposure assessment models,the Agency is allowing the use of site-specific data to calculate case-by-caselimits for sewage sludge that is disposed of in monofills and that is incinerated.These methods involve site-specific physical conditions that make a significantdifference in the pollutant limits.For land application, there are no physical parameters related to the sitethat make a significant difference in the pollutant limits. However, themodels could be used to re-calculate numerical limits based on site-specificdata. Should the Agency allow site-specific data to be used to calculatepollutant limits for factors other than those related to the physical characteristicsof the site or when there is less than a significant difference in theresulting pollutant limit? Will national limits for sewage sludge appliedto agricultural lands significantly inhibit the use of sewage sludge? Shouldthe Agency consider the use of case-by-case limits for agricultural landsbased on soil pH or type of crop grown and consider the testing of cropsto ensure that crop residue levels will not exceed a limit that would causethe pollutant concentration to exceed the human health criterion?The Agency believes that it would be impractical to establish case-by-caselimits for sewage sludge distributed and marketed because of the infinitenumber of possible site-specific conditions. Is this a logical assumption?The Agency is requiring the application of management practices for eachdisposal method to prevent gross abuse of the environment where it couldnot reasonably be anticipated that individuals would follow these managementpractices as part of the final use and disposal method. The Agency is alsorequiring controls to prevent the exposure of individuals and animals topathogenic organisms when sewage sludge is applied to the land, distributedand marketed, and disposed of in monofills and on surface disposal sites.For the most part, the Agency has assumed that good practices will be carriedout by the user and disposer. Should the Agency specify additional practicesor allow States and localities to specify additional practices?A summary of comments on issues, data, and information that the Agencyis requesting related to the definition of sewage sludge, to specific useor disposal methods, to the pathogen and vector attraction reduction requirements,and to the proposed pollutant limits follows.<ITAG tagnum="81">Sewage Sludge</ITAG>Septage and sewage sludge products are included in the definition of sewagesludge. By including septage in the definition of sewage sludge, the Agencydoes not wish to infer that it intends to regulate the location and operationof septic tanks. Therefore, septic tanks are specifically excluded fromthe definition of a treatment work. The Agency is regulating the use ordisposal of the pumpings from septic tanks because of its concern withthe levels of pathogenic organisms that may be in septage. However, arethere other regulatory approaches that should be considered for septagethat would tailor requirements to the Agency's specific concerns (e.g.,pathogenic organisms) and would relieve sewage sludge haulers from monitoringfor the 25 pollutants and calculating annual and cumulative pollutant loadingrates? The Agency is uncertain about the extent and magnitude of any disruptionsthat today's approach may cause and is soliciting comment on the effectof defining septage as sewage sludge.The Agency is also including sewage sludge products in the definition ofsewage sludge. Sewage sludge products are mixtures of sewage sludge andother materials frequently added during composting. Today's proposal includessewage sludge products within the definition of sewage sludge no matterhow small the percentage of sewage sludge in the product. The Agency issoliciting comment on the possibility of sewage sludge products that containso small a percentage of sewage sludge that they no longer have the characteristicsof sewage sludge.<ITAG tagnum="81">Land Application</ITAG>EPA is proposing different approaches for calculating pollutant limitsdepending on the use of the land. If the land is used for agriculturalcommodities that are eventually consumed by humans, the Agency is proposingannual and cumulative pollutant loading rates calculated with the exposureassessment model. If the land is used for non-agricultural purposes, the``current sludge quality'' (i.e., the 98th-percentile pollutant concentrationsshown in the ``40 City Study'') is used as the basis of the pollutant limitsunless the exposure assessment model calculated a higher pollutant limit.When the model calculated a higher pollutant limit, the higher limit isused. The Agency is also proposing to prohibit growing or taking food forhuman consumption on land used for non-agricultural purposes during theapplication of sewage sludge and for a 5-year period after the final applicationof the sewage sludge.Several issues arise on which the Agency is seeking public comment. Isit logical to assume that food is generally not grown on forest lands,lands being reclaimed, and lands dedicated to sludge disposal? Will theprohibition of taking food (e.g., hunting or berry picking) significantlyaffect uses of non-agricultural lands such as forests? Is 5 years a reasonableperiod of time to preclude growing food or feed crops or grazing animalson non-agricultural land that has been amended with sewage sludge? Willthe Agency's proposal inhibit the beneficial reuse of sewage sludge? Ifso, why?In deciding how to meet the pathogen reduction and vector attraction reductionrequirements, treatment works have more flexibility if they choose to applysewage sludge to land rather than to distribute and market it. With theincreased flexibility, the Agency is requiring an agreement, contract,or other instrument with the applier or distributor to ensure that theapplier is aware of the requirements (e.g., the time periods for publicaccess and use restrictions) and complies with the requirements. Are theprovisions in the agreement appropriate? Do treatment works believe thatthey will have difficulty in negotiating such agreements with those applyingor distributing the sewage sludge? Are there provisions which the Agencyshould add to the agreements? How should the Agency deal with situationsin which an applier of sewage sludge receives sewage sludge from more thanone treatment work?The land application model calculates pollutant limits for 14 pathways.The limit that EPA is proposing is derived from the pathway which resultsin the most stringent limit. The ``Land Application Technical Support Document''includes a matrix showing the limits for each pollutant in each pathway.Are there circumstances under which the limiting pathway is inappropriatefor sewage sludge applied to agricultural lands?Key assumptions in the model affecting the numerical limits were identifiedin the discussion on the exposure assessment models. The Agency is particularlyinterested in the values used in the exposure assessment models and whetherthe combination of assumptions used in the models and the requirementsin today's proposal adequately protect human public health and the environmentwithout over-regulating the beneficial use of sewage sludge. The Agency proposed prohibiting the application of sewage sludge to frozen,snow-covered, or flooded land unless it is demonstrated that sewage sludgewill not flow into nearby rivers, lakes, or streams. Are there circumstanceswhen the application of sewage sludge to frozen, snow-covered, or floodedlands does not pose such a threat?The models assume that certain practices such as incorporation into thesoil to a depth of 15 centimeters or a soil pH of 6, are generally followed.Are these assumptions correct? While the Agency does not believe that itshould mandate how landowers manage their land, are there other managementpractices directly tied to the protection of human health and the environmentthat the Agency has not specified, but should?Do the pathogen reduction and vector attraction reduction requirementsprovide treatment works sufficient flexibility in meeting the goal of reducingthe risk of transmitting pathogenic diseases from the use of sewage sludge?Are the time periods for restricting access to the land and grazing animalsappropriate? Are the time periods for the growing and harvesting of cropssufficient to reduce the risk of transmitting pathogenic organisms intothe food chain?<ITAG tagnum="81">Distribution And Marketing </ITAG>Is EPA's home garden scenario the appropriate assumption for the distributionand marketing of sewage sludge? The Agency is proposing that labels orinformation sheets accompany sewage sludge that is distributed and marketed.Is it also appropriate for the Agency to assume that use can be controlledwith a product label? Are the provisions on the labels or sheets the appropriateprovisions? Are there provisions that should be deleted? Are there provisionsthat should be added? Is it appropriate for the Agency to assume that usersof the sewage sludge product will follow the type of label or sheet thatthe Agency is proposing?Three key assumptions are used in calculating the pollutant limits. Thefirst assumption is that sewage sludge is incorporated into the soil toa depth of 15 centimeters (6 inches). The Agency is uncertain that naturalweathering processes will mix the sludge with the soil to that depth whenthe sewage sludge product is applied to a lawn. Are there studies on thedepth to which natural processes mix sewage sludge into the soil profile?Should the Agency have the labels or sheets require users to incorporatethe sewage sludge into the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches?The second key assumption in the home garden scenario is that animals raisedfor human consumption, as well as the food and feed crops for such animals,are not exposed to sewage sludge. As a consequence of this assumption andthe prohibition on the labels, the Agency eliminated pathways of exposurerelating to animals raised for human consumption. Elimination of theseanimal pathways results in less stringent numerical limits for organicpollutants than those for agricultural lands. Was it logical for the Agencyto assume that animals raised for human consumption were not a part ofthe home garden scenario?Finally, the Agency assumed that 20 applications of sewage sludge wouldbe applied to the land in calculating the pollutant limits for metals.Is this a logical assumption or is there documentation to show that greateror smaller number of applications are generally applied to home gardens?<ITAG tagnum="81">Monofills</ITAG>For the most part, EPA is using pollutant limits to protect human healthand the environment from potential adverse impacts of the disposal of sewagesludge in monofills. However, the Agency has included restrictions on thelocation of monofills and on other practices to ensure human health andthe environment are adequately protected. Are the requirements sufficient?Should the Agency include additional requirements, such as ground-watermonitoring or corrective action, or eliminate some requirements as redundantor inconsistent with the primary approach of controlling what is disposedof in the monofill (i.e., pollution prevention as opposed to pollutantcontainment)?The Agency has not analyzed the effect of synthetic liners in attenuatingthe migration of pollutants to the ground water. Neither has it factoredin the use of synthetic liners in situations for which case-by-case limitsare calculated. The soil characteristics of natural clay liners could beused in the site-specific analysis. How should the Agency analyze the attenuationfactor of synthetic liners?EPA is proposing that owners and operators of facilities develop a closureplan. Ther plan is to ensure that for 10 years a final cover is maintained,gas venting is monitored, and access restrictions are maintained. Sincedata show that sewage sludge decomposes within 4 to 5 years, does 10 yearsprovide a sufficient margin of safety for owners and operators to restrictthe use of the land for other purposes?Owners and operators will be required to determine the class of groundwater under their monofill. Are the definitions and guidance sufficientlyclear to allow such determinations to be made? The class of ground waterunder the monofill has a major effect on the assumptions used to establishthe pollutant concentrations. Pollutant limits for monofills must be determined with site-specific datawhen the distance from the sewage sludge unit to the monofill boundaryis less than 150 meters and where the background pollutant concentrationin the ground water exceeds the maximum contaminant level (MCL). Underthe latter case, pollutant concentrations would be established so thatthere is no further degradation of the ground water. Is this approach appropriatewhen, for monofills located over other classes of ground water, degradationis allowed as long as the pollutant concentrations in the ground waterdo not exceed the MCL? Should EPA establish pollutant limits such thatthere is no degradation of any ground water, whether or not that groundwater is used for drinking water?Pollutant limits may be determined using site-specific data if the parametersat the monofill differ from those on Table 6 in andSection; 503.33. Are thesethe appropriate parameters? Will there be difficulties in measuring anyof the parameters? Should other parameters, such as the use of syntheticliners, be included in case-by-case pollutant concentrations?In today's proposal the Agency is seeking comment on whether it shoulduse 5 micrograms per liter, the proposed MCL for lead which is measuredat the water treatment facility, or 10 micrograms per liter, which is thethreshold value for a treatment plan if a certain number of ``morning firstdraw samples'' exceed the value as the basis of the numerical concentrationfor lead in sludge disposed of in monofills. The Agency is soliciting commentson the appropriate value it should use. The Agency is also proposing that sewage sludge placed in monofills meetsthe Class B pathogen reduction requirements. Are the pathogen reductionrequirements appropriate?<ITAG tagnum="81">Surface Disposal Sites</ITAG>EPA is soliciting information on the size, location, and characteristicsof surface disposal sites. The Agency has proposed that sewage sludge placedon surface disposal sites for more than a year come under the requirementsof today's proposal. Is the Agency correct in assuming that sewage sludgeplaced on surface disposal sites for less than a year is more likely tobe used in treating sewage sludge rather than in its disposal?The Agency is proposing to use the 98th-percentile pollutant concentrationsfor sewage sludge disposed of on surface disposal sites because of itsbelief that surface disposal sites are small and that the pollutants inthe sludge are unlikely to result in significant human health or environmentalexposure. Are surface disposal sites usually small and are they generallylocated within the property boundary of the treatment work? As the Agencydevelops the exposure assessment model for surface disposal sites, it willbe collecting information that should confirm or refute these premises.Except for covers and a closure plan, the general requirements and managementpractices for surface disposal are similar to those for monofills and,in other cases, to dedicated, non-agricultural land application. Are thedistinctions in these three methods of disposal appropriate? Should thethree methods of disposal be consolidated? Or is there sufficient justificationto maintain the distinction?<ITAG tagnum="81">Pathogen Reduction and Vector Attraction Reduction Requirements</ITAG>Until EPA establishes a relationship between infectious dose and diseaseand develops a model to simulate the movement and attenuation of pathogenicorganisms in the environment, the Agency is proposing a combination ofperformance-based technology requirements and time periods during whichaccess to the land and the growing and harvesting of certain crops is restricted.Are there other approaches that the Agency should consider?The relative reductions in pathogenic organisms and the numbers of indicatororganisms that the Agency is proposing are based on limited research andthe Agency's experience with different types of treatment technologies.The Agency is requesting information that shows either that greater reductionsare likely to occur or that the Agency's assessment of the reductions likelyto occur was overoptimistic.<ITAG tagnum="81">Incineration</ITAG>A major issue on which the Agency is seeking public comment is the proposalto control the emission of organic pollutants through a limitation on theconcentration of total hydrocarbons in the emissions. Should other organicpollutants have been used in deriving the risk specific air concentrationfor total hydrocarbon emissions? Does the flame ionization detector, inconjunction with the correction factors included in the equation, limitthe level of organic emissions to an incremental carcinogenic risk levelof 1andmultiply;10-5? Should the Agency establish a national cap for totalhydrocarbon emissions or calculate, as proposed, a limit for each facility?The Agency is soliciting data that correlates organic emissions, carbonmonoxide levels, and total hydrocarbon emissions from multiple hearth,fluidized bed, and other types of incinerators which are similar to thosefiring sewage sludge. As an alternative to limiting hydrocarbon emissions,should the Agency consider using ``good'' performance standards, such asa 100-ppm limit, for carbon monoxide? Because data are lacking on goodsewage sludge incinerator performance, should the Agency use the organicpollutant-by-organic pollutant health-based approach? Are there other approachesthat the Agency should consider that would limit not only the organic pollutantsthat are fed into the incinerator, but also the organic pollutants thatare formed by the combustion process?In deriving the risk specific air concentrations for chromium and nickel,the Agency made the assumption that hexavalent chromium was one percentof the chromium emissions and that nickel subsulfide was 100 percent ofthe nickel emissions. Are there data to show that alternative percentagesof hexavalent chromium and nickel subsulfide should have been used?The Agency is requesting public comment on its proposal to use 25 percentof the NAAQS for lead as the basis for the lead limit. In light of thesignificant health effects from the emission of lead from sewage sludgeincinerators, would 10 percent of the NAAQS have been a more appropriatebasis?Are the values that the EPA is proposing for temperature and oxygen contentof the exit gas reasonable for sewage sludge incinerators? The Agency issoliciting data from tests that may support or question the proposed values.Should the Agency have specified requirements for incinerator ash and incineratorscrubber water? If so, how would these requirements differ from those alreadyin place under other regulatory programs?The Agency is soliciting comments on whether to deny owners or operatorsthe opportunity to obtain credit for an increase in the height of theirstacks, after the effective date of the rule, as a means of complying withthe numerical limits in the rule. Raising the stack height increases theamount of dispersion, thereby reducing the concentration of the exposurethat reaches the MEI. However, raising the stack does not reduce the massemission of the pollutants. National cancer incidence, therefore, may notchange significantly from increasing stack height rather than installingconstant controls (e.g., wet electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) and after-burners).<ITAG tagnum="81">Use Of The Numerical Limits</ITAG>The pollutant limits included in today's proposal are based on extensivedata and analysis. The proposal raises many precedential scientific, technicaland policy issues. Therefore, depending on results of the National SewageSludge and comments on the proposed rule, the Agency may revise some ofthe limits. It would not be advisable for permit writers to use the proposedlimits in permits in advance of the final issuance of the ``Guidance ForWriting Case-By-Case Permit Requirements for Municipal Sewage Sludge''.This Guidance Document was developed to assist permit writers in developingpermits for sewage sludge prior to the technical standards in today's proposal.The Guidance document is based on existing Federal and State requirements.It is not inconsistent with today's proposal. Rather, today's proposalgoes beyond the Guidance document. Revisions to the Guidance document willassist permit writers in giving the appropriate weight to the numericallimits in today's proposal. These revisions should be available by September30, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Related Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Monitoring, Record Keeping And Reporting</ITAG>The Agency is proposing sewage sludge monitoring, record keeping, and reportingrequirements with the Part 503 requirements. However, the Agency is alsoconsidering placing such requirements in the State program management requirements(40 CFR Part 501) and in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systempermitting requirements (40 CFR Parts 222-224). Comments are solicitedon this. In addition, the Agency is soliciting comments on the frequencywith which it is proposing to have facilities test their sewage sludge,the sampling and analysis protocols that are to be used in testing andanalyzing the sewage sludge, and the record keeping and reporting requirementsthat the Agency is proposing. The Agency recognizes that the proposed requirementsare minimum requirements and that many States have much more frequent andextensive monitoring, record keeping, and reporting requirements. Shouldthe Agency specify more frequent sewage sludge monitoring requirements?Should the Agency base the sewage sludge monitoring requirements on factorsother than wastewater flow (e.g, percent industrial influent to the facility)or should the Agency establish a uniform frequency for the first year andthen allow less frequent testing based on the variations seen in the facility'ssludge quality?The Agency is proposing different record retention requirements, dependingon the use or disposal method. When sewage sludge is applied to agriculturalland, the records must be kept for the life of the publicly owned treatmentwork (POTW) to ensure that the cumulative pollutant loading rates for metalsare not exceeded. For the disposal of sewage sludge in monofills, recordsmust be kept for 10 years, the proposed closure period. For all other useor disposal methods, the Agency is proposing that records be retained for5 years, the period of time proposed for the State program management regulations.As an alternative, the Agency also considered record retention requirementsof 3 years. Should the Agency have a single record retention requirementsfor all use or disposal methods? Do the distinctions among the use or disposalmethods justify different record retention requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">Removal Credits</ITAG>The Agency is proposing to allow eligible POTWs to revise pretreatmentstandards and issue removal credits for pollutants in three situations.First, removal credits would be available for the pollutants that are regulatedunder the use or disposal method employed by the POTW. Removal creditswould also be available for the pollutants in sewage sludge disposed ofin MSWLFs in compliance with 40 CFR Part 258. Finally, removal creditswould be available for pollutants that the Agency evaluated without establishingnumerical limits, if a POTW employs the disposal method for which the pollutantwas evaluated, because EPA concluded that, even under the worst conditions,the pollutant did not interfere with the use or disposal method.The list of organic pollutants on Table 11 in andSection; 503.72 includesonly those organic pollutants listed in IRIS. Some organic pollutants,such as vinyl chloride, are not presently listed in IRIS because theirhuman health criteria are undergoing Agency review. IRIS changes periodically.How should the Agency revise and update Table 11? Adding pollutants toTable 11 will require recalculating a human health criterion for totalhydrocarbons and adjusting the risk specific concentration.The Agency is soliciting comment on the proposal to limit removal creditsto pollutants regulated under a use or disposal method included in today'sproposal when a POTW employs use or disposal methods other than disposalin MSWLFs. The Agency also solicits comments on its decision not to allowremoval credits for pollutants when the concentration of those pollutantslead to the determination that the sewage sludge is hazardous, even thoughdisposal of this sludge in conformance with 40 CFR Part 261-268 constitutescompliance with Section 405(d) of the CWA. <ITAG tagnum="81">Impact</ITAG>The Agency projected that the benefits of complying with this rule includethe following: a reduction of 9.5 annual cancer cases (from 12.3 annualincremental cancer cases attributable to the use or disposal of sewagesludge); and a reduction of 5,266 incidences of individuals who experienceadverse effects from lead (from 6,139). This projection is a net increasein benefits due to the fact that, in some instances (e.g., incineration),the anticipated compliance strategy poses greater risk. Furthermore, inprojecting the reduction in cancer and lead cases, the Agency assumed thatincinerators would install constant controls (e.g., after-burners and wetESPs).To come into compliance with the rule, the Agency projected that 5,300POTWs will have annual incremental costs of approximately $157.7 milliondollars. Some of these costs are pursuant to monitoring, reporting, andrecord keeping requirements. Other costs are due to the costs of puttingon constant controls or using a different use or disposal method. It isanticipated that 509 POTWs will have to take positive actions to come intocompliance with today's proposal. The projected cost figure does not accountfor site-specific modeling to bring some POTWs into compliance with theproposed numerical limits. Nor does it reflect that some POTWs may strengthentheir pretreatment programs to improve the quality of their sewage sludge.To improve the Agency's analyses, comments are requested on the following:andbullet; Procedures for assigning a particular sludge quality to an individualfacility;andbullet; Relationship of industrial flow to the quality and amount of thesewage sludge generated;andbullet; Procedures used to assign a use or disposal method to a particularfacility;andbullet; Baseline costs of the disposal practices;andbullet; Baseline costs for testing, monitoring, and record keeping requirements;andbullet; Assumptions in determining if a facility complies with the requirements,particularly the annual pollutant loading rates for agricultural land application;andbullet; Assumptions concerning how facilities would comply with the requirements,particularly the assumptions made on the alternative practices that wouldbe used;andbullet; Assumptions used to determine the retrofit technologies ownersand operators of sewage sludge incinerators would use to comply with today'sproposal;andbullet; Additional data needed to make assumptions on the feasibilityof pretreatment by industrial dischargers;andbullet; Assumptions used in projecting the benefits of the rule; andandbullet; Definition of a small entity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">While the foregoing discussion lists the major issues, data and informationof interest to the Agency, any provision of the rule is open for publiccomment. The Agency will carefully evaluate all public comments and willrespond to the comments in the Notice modifying today's proposal and inpromulgating the rule.<ITAG tagnum="85">PART XIII.

These standards provide specific pollutantconcentrations, management practices, and other requirements for the finaluse or disposal of sewage sludge when the sewage sludge is applied to agriculturaland non-agricultural land, distributed and marketed, disposed of in monofillsor on surface disposal sites, or incinerated. The standards apply to publiclyand privately owned treatment works that generate or treat domestic sewagesludge and to any person who uses or disposes of sewage sludge from suchtreatment works. Existing requirements in 40 CFR Part 257 are applicable to all solid wastedisposal facilities and practices regulated under sections 4004 and 4010of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. With certain exceptionslisted in andSection; 257.1(c), the requirements in 40 CFR Part 257 applyto all types of facilities (i.e., landfills, surface disposal sites, landapplication units, and waste piles) used for disposal of solid waste, aswell as all types of non-hazardous solid wastes (i.e., municipal, industrial,commercial, agricultural, mining, and oil and gas waste). Part 257 alsoapplies to the disposal of sewage sludge from publicly and privately ownedtreatment works. However, because Part 257 covers only a limited numberof pollutants and use and disposal practices and because EPA is proposingcomprehensive regulations under 40 CFR Part 503, EPA proposes to amend40 CFR Part 257 to exclude sewage sludge. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>40 CFR Part 257 Reporting and record keeping requirements, waste disposal. 40 CFR Part 503 Sewage sludge use and disposal, monitoring, reporting and record keepingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 18, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
