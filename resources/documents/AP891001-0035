However, Mitchell acknowledged that a revised version might haveenough support to win narrow approval because Bush's``irresponsible position ... makes it extremely difficult toprevent any tax cut from occurring.''   Interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' the Maine Democratsaid he is positive the 27-month capital gains tax cut approved bythe House last week will not be enacted by the Senate.   ``It is so bad, so wrong for the economy,'' he said. ``It willdo for the deficit what crack does for the user: a quick short highfollowed by a long, painful depression.''   The measure would reduce from 33 percent to 19.6 percent themaximum tax rate on profits from the sale of stocks and otherinvestments until 1992. The rate then would climb back to 28percent with assets indexed so that any gains attributed toinflation after that point would not be taxed.   Its attractiveness to lawmakers stems from predictions byeconomists that a selloff by investors rushing to cash in on thelow-rate window would generate $9.4 billion in additional taxrevenue over the next three years.   After then, however, the revenues would fall dramatically andactually worsen the deficit by a total of $21 billion over thefollowing five years, according to Congress' Joint Committee onTaxation.   ``I'm confident that this so-called yo-yo _ on two years, offtwo years _ and the way in which it's constructed cannot pass,''Mitchell said. ``There's a growing realization that it will be badfor the economy ... and will do nothing for the future of thiscountry.''   While saying he personally opposes any cut in capital gainstaxes now, Mitchell acknowledged that many members of his partyfavor enacting a differential that would tax capital gains at alower rate than wages, interest or dividend income.   ``Whether or not they will coalesce behind any plan along withRepublicans, I don't know,'' he said. ``It will be very close onsome other plan.''   A majority of Senate Democrats have united behind an alternativeplan proposed by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, to restore up to$1,000 a year of tax deductibility for contributions to IndividualRetirement Accounts. IRA deductibility ended in 1987 under theloophole-closing tax law a year earlier that also raised the rateon capital gains.   House Democratic leaders tried the same IRA substitute, butlinked it to an increase in taxes on families with incomes of morethan $145,000 a year.   Mitchell said Senate Democrats will not link their IRA proposalto such an increase, but rather will propose to make up revenuelost to expanded IRA deductions by extending telephone and otherexcise taxes that were due to expire at the end of this year.   Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley predicted on the sameprogram that the House probably will vote this week to repealMedicare catastrophic health care coverage that it enacted lastyear for some 33 million elderly Americans.   Many beneficiaries, especially the wealthier among them, havebalked at having to pay premiums this year of up to $800 to helpcover medical expenses for retirees of more modest means.   ``I hope personally that the program is retained on a modifiedform,'' said Foley, D-Wash. ``But ... there are a great number ofRepublicans and some Democrats in the House who are in favor ofrepeal. If I were guessing today, I think it probably would berepealed.''   Foley also said it is doubtful that Congress will completeaction on a deficit-reduction bill, which would include any taxmeasure, before the Oct. 16 deadline.   That is the date broad spending cuts in both military anddomestic programs would be triggered automatically unless Congresscomes up with $6 billion in new revenues or program cuts forreducing the budget deficit for fiscal year 1990, which beganSunday.   ``We might have some few days in which there would be atechnical sequestration, that is an across-the-board cuttingthrough executive order of all the accounts,'' Foley said. ``Idon't think that's going to be a permanent situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
