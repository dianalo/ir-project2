The Air Force said it will enter a fixed-price contract with Boeing for full-scale development of the nuclear-tipped, air-to-surface missile in coming weeks. Engineering and production of 1,633 missiles over the next five years will cost about $3.06 billion, the Air Force said. Boeing made the short-range missile that the SRAM-II will replace.    The SRAM II faces a tough time in Congress, however. Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), who is slated to be chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee in the next Congress, has questioned whether the weapon is needed and is looking to save money by cutting programs about to enter full-scale development and production.    In other awards, Lockheed Corp. received a $44.6 million addition to an Air Force contract for spare parts for C-5B cargo aircraft.    General Dynamics Corp. was awarded $21 million in Air Force contracts for missile parts and for base support for the Egyptian air force.    General Electric Co.'s RCA Government Systems division was granted a $13 million Army contract for tracked vehicle spare parts.    Boeing also won an $11.5 million addition to an Air Force contract for improvements to B-1B radar sets. </TEXT></DOC>
