A slow heating rate organic devolatilization reactorwas used to obtain liquid and solid products at a mild heating rate toa range of final temperatures. The rapid rate liquid products were obtainedusing either a fluid-bed reactor or an entrained-flow system. The liquidsgenerated at mild and severe conditions are being characterized by anumber of techniques (Field Ionization Mass Spectroscopy, SequentialElution Solvent Chromatography, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy,Elemental Analysis, etc.). At a rapid heating rate, the yields of heavierpolyfunctional groups are markedly greater compared to that obtainedat a slow rate. The liquids generated at a slow heating rate are of lowermolecular weight, viscosity, sulfur content, but of higher H/C atomicratios compared to the liquids obtained at a rapid rate. The effect ofincreasing the maximum devolatilization temperatures (at a constant slowheating rate) was to increase the yield of light gases (mainly H{sub2}) at the expense of char hydrogen content. The tar yield is not markedlyinfluenced when the peak devolatilization temperature is increased. However,the quality of the liquids or the reactivity (in air) of the productchar was reduced when the peak pyrolysis temperatures were increased.It is proposed that at a rapid rate, the primary products, representativefragments of the parent coal structure, are devolatilized and, therefore,are of poorer quality. At a slow heat-up rate, however, the primary coalfragments undergo additional cracking reactions forming low molecularweight hydrocarbons of relatively higher quality.</TEXT></DOC>
