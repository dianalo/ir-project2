Approval by the Diet's powerful lower house now seemsassured.</LP><TEXT>   The bill would explicitly forbid payments by brokeragehouses to compensate clients for losses suffered in financialmarkets, and would also make it a criminal act for a clientto request such payments.   Brokers could be jailed up to a year and fined one millionyen ($7,508) for a violation, and clients could be imprisonedsix months and fined 500,000 yen.   Current law only forbids promises to compensate forlosses.   In its week-long course through committee, the draftproved the basis for a string of new disclosures aboutJapan's financial scandals. By supporting the bill,opposition parties gained the publication of partial resultsof a Finance Ministry probe and the chance to haranguegovernment handling of the securities-industry scandals thathave rocked the Japanese market this summer and inflamedsentiment that Japanese dealings are unfair.   The lower house's 40-member Special Committee RegardingSecurities and Financial Problems unanimously approved thebill late yesterday. Party leaders have agreed to have thedraft approved today by the lower house's full membershipwithout debate, Parliament sources say, after which it willbe sent to the weaker upper house.   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party doesn't have amajority in that body, but the lower house that it dominatescan overrule the upper house on any matter that isn't abudget or a treaty.   The government badly wants its bill approved into law inthe current extraordinary session, which ends next Friday.   Release on Tuesday of partial results of a financeministry probe into Japan's four largest securities firmsgrew out of a closed, multiparty meeting of leaders of thespecial Diet panel last Friday.   The announcements showed that the so-called Big Fourbrokers -- Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., NikkoSecurities Co. and Yamaichi Securities Co. -- paid clients atotal of 43.5 billion yen ($326.6 million) in the year endedMarch 31, 1991, a considerable amount when compared with theroughly 126 billion yen they paid in the two years and sixmonths though March 1990.   Only weeks earlier, senior officials of the firms had toldthe same panel they hadn't heard of compensation paid afterMarch 1990.   Nikko said it paid 23.5 billion yen in compensation to 38clients in 1991; Yamaichi admitted to 16.4 billion yen paidto 14 clients; Daiwa said it paid 20 clients a total of 3.3billion yen; and Nomura reported 435 million yen paid to sixclients.   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto conceded that thedisclosure exposes &quot;the truth that the instructions from theFinance Ministry {issued in December 1989, to stopcompensation payments} were completely ignored.&quot;   The disclosures also resulted in newspaper reports, citingFinance Ministry documents, that the most recent compensationpayments included cases where payments exceeded the client'smarket losses -- leading some panel members to charge thatthis was proof of returns promised by the brokers.</TEXT></DOC>
