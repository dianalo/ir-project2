(products).andO;Product:   Inside Information (Data base).andO;Topic:     Software PackagesEvaluationThesauriDictionariesData Bases.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Inside Information, from Microlytics, is a new Macintosh desk accessory thatclassifies about 65,000 terms in a structured schema.andP;  Based on work by anovelist and editor named Steven Glazier, it is described as &quot;the first newclassification system for language in nearly 150 years&quot;--that is, since PeterRoget published his thesaurus.andM;The program breaks our world into seven categories: Nature, Science andamp;Technology, Domestic Life, Institutions, Arts andamp; Entertainment, Language, andthe Human Condition.andP;  Each category contains up to five subsidiary levels ofinformation, with the last level containing specific terms.andP;  In most cases,definitions of these terms can be displayed; in others, the terms merely forma list (as under &quot;Trees&quot;).andM;Who is likely to benefit from Inside Information?andP;  Microlytics says that itsfeatures &quot;offer a natural way to build vocabulary, solve crossword puzzles,win at trivia games, carry on a knowledgeable conversation on almost anysubject, or enliven any piece of writing.' After working (and playing) withthe program for a couple of hours, we think that this hyperbolic claim is onthe mark.andM;Only the last of these benefits matters for our publication.andP;  If, forinstance, a writer is struggling to sound knowledgeable about automobiles,Inside Information is a good source for relevant terms and for a quickrundown (pardon the pun) of the differences among a flivver, a hot rod and ajalopy.andM;Varying views.andP;  Inside Information lets the user view an entry and itshierarchical placement in any of three ways: Outline, which indents entriesbelow their  parents'; Graphic, which displays vertical stacks of entrieswith scroll bars, with subsidiary levels to the right of their parents; andTree, similar to Graphic but arrayed horizontally, with lower levels belowtheir parents.andM;In any of these views, the user may search on a word or phrase; the programcycles through each entry that contains that word or phrase in its name or inits definition, letting the user view the entry within its hierarchy.andP;  TheReverse Dictionary function enables the user to search for similar words; itlocates any entry containing a word that matches most of the characters ofthe search target.andP;  In all cases, the last 30 words found can be viewed.andM;The user can select any number of entries from a list (by clicking on each,selecting all or dragging the mouse) and print them.andP;  The printout shows thepath followed by each entry and its definition.andP;  In addition, any definitioncan be copied to the Macintosh clip-board.andM;Initial imperfections.andP;  Such a mammoth undertaking, especially in its firstrelease, is bound to have shortcomings.andP;  The main problem areas that we sawwere consistency and accuracy.andM;There are, for instance, three definitions of &quot;desktop publishing.&quot; Thedifferences among them arc small but significant.andP;  Here are the threedefinitions, as well as the &quot;path&quot; along which each is found:andM;Science andamp; Technology/BuildingandM;Blocks andamp; Working Parts/Computers/andM;General Technology andamp; Concepts:andM;use of personal computer withandM;graphics programs, sometimes anandM;image scanner, and printer to de -  sign and create brochures or smallandM;booksandM;Institutions/Society at Large/andM;Publishing andamp; Journalism/Publishing:andM;small-scale publication of materialsandM;using home computers and printersandM;with graphics capabilities and variousandM;type fontsandM;Arts andamp; Entertainment/TheandM;Arts/Painting andamp; Graphic Art/GraphicandM;Arts: creation of graphic presentationsandM;and designs by computerandM;More serious are inconsistencies that detract from meaning.andP;  Within theComputer Hardware andamp; Peripherals section, &quot;CD drive&quot; is defined as &quot;disk driveaccepting compact disk storage medium.&quot; However, a user looking for furtherinformation about compact disk storage would be stumped because in otherentries it is spelled &quot;compact disc.&quot; The only other relevant entry in theComputer category is &quot;CD-ROM,&quot; which carries this elaboration: &quot;CompactDisk[sic] Read-Only Memory; compact disc[sic] used for permanent storage ofmassive amounts of data.&quot;andM;The authors often display a poor grasp of the computer field.andP;  &quot;Shareware&quot; isdefined as &quot;relatively simple programs available at no charge or for a tokendonation,&quot; which would surprise the makers of such powerful shareware hits asProcomm and PC-Write.andP;  &quot;RISC&quot; is defined as &quot;Reduced Instruction SetComputing; designation for increase in processing speed,&quot; a false conclusion.andO;&quot;Search and replace&quot; is defined as  Capacity of editing program to find anyappearance of character, word, or phrase in file and replace it with anothercharacter, word, or phrase,&quot; an assessment that ignores many programs'ability to search on such attributes as font, size and type style.andP;  &quot;C&quot; isnot listed within the category of Software, Languages andamp; Programming.andM;We might also quibble with the program names that are or aren't included;users will find Word, WordStar and Word Perfect, but only Lotus 1,2,3 (whichis given the obsoletable distinction &quot;most popular spreadsheet program&quot;), notcompetitors such as Excel or SuperCalc.andM;Impressive intentions.andP;  Despite these sorts of flaws, we like InsideInformation because of the fresh perspective it offers on learning about ourworld.andP;  It provides a valuable context and reference source for a wealth ofitems and ideas, and its structure of relationships can spark new insights.andO;Extra value will be added later this year, when Microlytics releases aproduct that combines Inside Informations interface with an onlineencyclopedia.andM;Don't depend on Inside Information for full, precise definitions oftechnological terms, but if you have 3 1/2 megabytes free on your Mac's harddisk and $119 (retail price) of disposable income, you'll probably find waysto benefit from Microlytics' latest inspiration.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
