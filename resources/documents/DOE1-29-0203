Such a test would allow for the assessment of potentialdownstream effluent treatment without having to produce waste water onthe pilot plant scale. A second objective of the project is to correlatethe yields of water-soluble organics to specific pyrolysis conditionsand coal types using the data generated by the above experimental test.</TEXT></DOC>
