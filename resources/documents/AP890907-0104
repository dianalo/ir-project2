(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL raised nearly $17 million in one weekduring 1986, but its Heritage Grand Hotel was almost constantlyshort of cash, the jury in Jim Bakker's fraud trial was told today.   The testimony came after a day after the judge pronounced the TVevangelist competent to stand trial. A government psychiatrist hadtestified that Bakker suffered a ``panic attack'' last week but isnot going crazy.   Delores Jones, who worked in PTL's cash management office,testified this morning that during the week of May 31, 1986, theministry collected $13,000 from passing the plate at Sunday servicesand $7,000 from the TV audience of ``The Jim and Tammy Show.''   ``It was sometimes more, sometimes less,'' she said when askedwhether the $20,000 in cash collections for the week were unusual.   Ms. Jones said the rest of the $17 million ``would have to be theLifetime Silver 1000 Account,'' one of several ``lifetimepartnership'' programs that offered $1,000 contributors threenights' free lodging each year for life.   Prosecutors say Bakker and other PTL executives diverted to theirown use more than $4 million of the $158 million raised bypartnerships from 1984 to 1987. If convicted on all counts, Bakkercould receive 120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines.   William Maybrey, general manager of Heritage Grand Hotel in1984-85, testified today that the management contract with BrockHotel Corp. required that half the 500 rooms be set aside forlifetime partners. Brock employed Maybrey to run the hotel.   He said PTL had agreed to keep a $300,000 balance in an operatingaccount for the hotel, but he warned Bakker in two memos in 1985that the account was at least $195,000 short of the requirement.Brock had to pay employees out of its own funds at one point becauseof the shortages, Maybrey testified.   ``It was difficult to balance the level of services with the cashflow problems we were experiencing,'' said Maybrey.   Last week, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter committed Bakker toa federal prison for psychiatric evaluation after his lawyersreported he was hallucinating and cowering under a couch. After acompetency hearing Wednesday out of sight of the jury, Potterreleased Bakker.   ``He is not going crazy,'' Dr. Sally Johnson, head of thepsychiatric team at the Federal Correctional Institution in Butner,told the judge. ``He has no hidden mental illness. The stress thathe's feeling is normal.''   Ms. Johnson said she didn't think Bakker had faked his breakdown.She said Bakker told her that journalists at the courthouse took onthe form of frightening animals.   In Wednesday's testimony, former fund-raiser Carol Price brokeinto tears when she described trying to discourage an elderly womanfrom purchasing a $1,000 lifetime partnership. She said she wasfired for complaining about PTL policy.   ``I told her that selling a burial policy to buy a lifetimepartnership was not a good idea,'' Ms. Price said Wednesday.   Former PTL Vice President Steve Nelson, whose fainting episode onthe stand last week was cited by doctors as triggering Bakker'sbreakdown, returned to testify Wednesday.   Nelson said he had gone to Bakker and former PTL Vice PresidentRichard Dortch with concerns over the number of ``lifetimepartnerships'' sold at the 500-room Heritage Grand Hotel.   ``I told them we had problems getting people in there,'' he said.``I told them we could not sell more memberships.''   Ms. Price testified that workers were encouraged to sell as manypartnerships as they could, regardless of whether the hotel couldaccommodate them.   Ms. Price, who was in charge of handling partner relations, saidshe took her concerns to Bakker on several occasions. She said thatwhen she and 10 members of her staff were fired in 1985, she askedNelson, her boss at the time, why she was let go.   ``He leaned back in his chair and said, `That's the price you payfor knowing too much and not keeping your mouth shut,''' she said,crying. ``Ten people lost their jobs because my conscience wouldn'tlet me keep my mouth shut. I carry that with me to this day.''   Bakker, who said he was suffering from the flu, appeared morealert during Wednesday's testimony. He smiled, chatted withattorneys and reviewed documents.   He showed little emotion during the morning competency hearing,sometimes hanging his head and staring at the floor.   Bakker, who resigned from the PTL ministry in 1987 in asex-and-money scandal, went on trial Aug. 28.   Prosecutors contend Bakker oversold the partnerships and usednearly $4 million in ministry funds to live in high style.</TEXT></DOC>
