But despite the increased opportunities to participate, the finer points of evaluating such investments generally remain a mystery. &quot;With very few exceptions, the public really has very little understanding of the mechanics of a leveraged buyout,&quot; says Jeffrey Kenner, president of buyout specialist Kenner andamp; Co.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors buys a company and takes it private, using mostly borrowed funds to finance the transaction. Cash flow and often asset sales are used to pay down the debt.    Judging whether the proposed ways of doing that make sense requires analysis that is different from what most investors are used to. Traditionally, investors value companies on the basis of reported earnings. But people active in the leveraged-buyout business focus on cash flow.    Cash flow excludes several accounting charges, such as depreciation, that can obscure a company's true earnings. For a mature company, for instance, hefty depreciation may trim reported net income, while the real value of its assets to a potential buyer may actually be appreciating.    Buyout analysts begin by checking the ratio between a company's total value (its debt plus the market value of its equity) and its pre-tax operating cash flow (or pre-tax operating profit plus depreciation). This multiple, they say, should be comfortably within the 6-to-8 range that leveraged buyouts currently sell for.    Buyout analysts also look at two other ratios: equity value to earnings and equity value to after-tax cash flow (net income plus depreciation and deferred taxes). &quot;In taking this three-pronged approach, we find that each estimate serves as a check on the others,&quot; says Paul Farrell, an analyst at Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.    By comparing a buyout's earnings and cash-flow multiples with those of similar companies in the same sector, analysts say they can assess how much the equity has been discounted to allow for leverage.    For example, building-materials companies generally are priced at 60% to 80% of the market multiple. A leveraged buyout in that industry should command a price of only 40% to 60% of the market multiple. As debt is paid off, the buyout's multiple would be expected to rise to be in line with those of other companies in its sector.    &quot;A key thing in these transactions is that they are a play on market multiples,&quot; says David Gruber, a vice president of leveraged buyout firm Carl Marks andamp; Co. &quot;If multiples drop in a bear market, and the value of the company drops from six times cash flow to five times cash flow, your equity may have just disappeared.&quot;    Working through these preliminary valuations leads to the central issue to investors -- the projected return. Consider the following hypothetical buyout:    The company, let's call it Indebted Inc., is valued by its management and investment bankers at $950 million. The buyout will be accomplished with $850 million of debt and $100 million of equity.    The proposed restructuring includes the immediate sale of a $350 million asset. This will reduce Indebted's value to $600 million, or 6.7 times the $90 million cash flow remaining after the asset sale.    The asset sale will also reduce debt to $500 million. Through growth and improved profit margins, management expects annual cash flow to grow to $125 million in five years. After taxes and interest payments, they figure they will be able to retire another $150 million of debt.    What gains does Indebted promise? Well, five years out, it's supposed to be a company with $125 million of cash flow, $350 million of debt, improved operating margins and, thus, better performance.    As a result, the restructured assets are projected to be worth 7.2 times cash flow -- or $900 million. Subtract the remaining $350 million of debt, and the value of the remaining equity would then be $550 million. That means the $100 million of original equity would grow 5.5 times in five years -- a 41% compounded annual rate.    Investment bankers active in the buyout field say that projected returns should be at least 30% a year to make the risks worthwhile. Substituting less optimistic numbers for the projected growth and asset values, they say, allows investors to gauge how much and how fast they would suffer if those targets are missed. </TEXT></DOC>
