Iran said it intervened for ``humanitarian reasons.'' Chiracsaid normal relations with Iran, broken July 17, ``could beenvisaged.''   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua told reporters that no moneywas paid to free the hostages and that France did not negotiatewith the captors. But a Syrian mediator said France repaid $670million in borrowed money to Iran and made other compensation tothe kidnappers.   Diplomats Marcel Carton, 62, Marcel Fontaine, 45, and journalistJean-Paul Kauffmann, 44, arrived at the military airport ofVillacoublay in a special government jet. They were freed Wednesdayevening in Beirut.   ``It's an incredible day,'' Kauffmann said, looking thin buthealthy. ``But it's also a day which remains overshadowed becausewe are just three.''   Kauffmann then spoke at length about Michel Seurat, the Frenchresearcher captured with him who is believed dead. Kauffmann saidearlier that Seurat, said to have been executed by his kidnappers,probably died of cancer.   ``I'm a little ashamed to be here today,'' Kauffmann said. Hethen recalled Western hostages still being held in Beirut ``leadingthat nightmare life.''   Carton said the three saw other hostages, but did not know whothey were.   Chirac, in a short address, also thanked Syrian President HafezAssad and Lebanese military authorities for their help in gainingfreedom for the hostages, who were held by pro-Iranian extremists.   ``As we all know, the liberation of our hostages falls into theframework of our relations with Iran,'' Chirac said. ``It's theauthorities in Tehran who intervened with the captors so that theyfree our countrymen.'' He said that France had been awaiting thereleases ``for weeks and for months.''   Iran's official Tehran Television, monitored in Cyprus, quotedAli Reza Moayyeri, a deputy prime minister for political affairs,as saying that Iran interceded with ``the Moslem people ofLebanon'' on behalf of the hostages.   The broadcast quoted Moayyeri as predicting the release wouldlead to the restoration of diplomatic relations with France.   Chirac, evoking questions about the means by which the hostageswere freed, said the government ``never ceased to act with dignityand honor.''   Commentators immediately raised the issue of a deal and beganspeculating about what transpired. Ten French hostages have beenfreed since Chirac's government took office in March 1986.   In response to questions from reporters, Pasqua said: ``We havenot accorded any funds of any sort to anyone, not a franc, not adollar, not a deutschmark, not a yen.''   ``There were no negotiations with the captors,'' he continued.``I think that would have been completely useless.''   There were reports in Beirut that France agreed to repay Iran'sfundamentalist rulers the outstanding two-thirds of a $1 billionloan made by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.   A Syrian mediator said in Geneva today that France finishedrepaying the loan as part of the deal.   ``It was paid back in three installments, the last one just veryrecently,'' Omran Adham told The Associated Press. ``This is myinformation from the French, Syrians and Iranians.''   Adham, a 41-year-old Syrian businessman, undertook severalmediation missions over the past two years in which he asked Assadto intervene with Iran for the freeing of the hostages.   He said he was certain the French government offered other``compensation for the kidnappers,'' though he had no proof. Thegovernment expelled Adham from France Tuesday.   It was not known what effect the release might have on Chirac'schances in Sunday's presidential runoff against President FrancoisMitterrand. The Socialist president, who is seeking a secondseven-year term, has been considered the favorite.   The hostages arrived at the airport at 10:37 a.m. (4:37 a.m.EDT).   Carton's wife, Denise, left Beirut today to join her husband inParis. Airport sources said she was flying via Zurich.   ``As soon as the detention of our hostages in Lebanon ended, thereestablishment of normal relations between France and Iran couldbe envisaged conforming to our concept of what rapport betweenstates should be,'' Chirac said.   France and Iran broke diplomatic relations last summer in adispute over an Iranian Embassy employee, Wahid Gordji, who refusedto submit to questioning about the series of bombings in Paris inSeptember 1986.   Carton, former embassy vice consul in Beirut, told a reporteraboard the plane that he and the other captives ``saw otherhostages, but we did not know exactly who they were.''   Seurat, a 39-year-old academic researcher, was kidnapped May 22,1985, along with Kauffmann, a magazine reporter with whom he wasworking. Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, claimed it killed him March 5,1986. His body was not found, but his wife said French officialsconfirmed his death.   Carton and Fontaine, an embassy protocol officer in Beirut, wereseized by Islamic Jihad on March 22, 1985.   There are still 18 foreigners, including nine Americans, missingand believed held hostage in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, 40, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longestheld. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, responding to reports that Cartonhad spent time as a hostage with Anderson, said she was encouraged.   ``I was very anxious to view the other hostages as they got offthe plane,'' she said in an interview in Batavia, N.Y. ``The veryfact that they were walking and talking was encouraging to me. Andespecially now that I know that Mr. Carton spent time with Terry.''</TEXT></DOC>
