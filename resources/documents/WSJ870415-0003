The revisions, which also would strengthen rules on banks' off-balance-sheet business, are necessary to adapt to &quot;rapid and far-reaching changes&quot; in international financial markets, the watchdog agency's annual report says.    The Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank, has long argued that companies that conduct underwriting, brokerage or portfolio management business should come under banking regulations. The commission said such off-balance-sheet activities also account for a growing share of bank earnings, which may require a change in reserve requirements.    Foreign rivals have entered the Swiss market through so-called non-bank banks, which avoid banking regulations by not accepting public deposits. This initially led to tension between Switzerland and Japan, but that was eased with the granting of trust banking licenses to Swiss banks in Tokyo.    The banking commission expects to present its proposals this year for study by the Swiss government. Other changes may include new rules on liquidity and on the use of new financial instruments. Further details haven't been disclosed. </TEXT></DOC>
