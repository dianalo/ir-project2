The 1990Census data show that the lowest quintile of familiesreceived 4.6% of America's aggregate money income, while thehighest quintile received 44.3%. These numbers change onlyvery slightly from year to year.   From this one might conclude that the U.S. is a highlyunequal society and that those born poor are forever doomedto remain poor, while those born rich will remain so. Infact, this perception is quite false. It assumes that thesame people are in each quintile year after year. Yet thetruth is that there is meaningful movement by people up anddown the income scale continuously.</LP><TEXT>   In recent years the Census bureau has attempted to measurethese movements through a program called the Survey of Incomeand Program Participation, which tracks changes in income byspecific families over time. The data from this programconclusively demonstrate that mobility between income classesis significant. For example, between 1987 and 1988, almostone-fourth of the families that had been in the highestquintile had fallen into lower quintiles.   Conversely, 17% of those in the lowest quintile were in ahigher quintile the following year. As the table indicates,this kind of movement goes on yearly.   As one might expect, extending the analysis to additionalyears shows greater movement between income classes. Althoughthe Census bureau does not produce multi-year data, such astudy was done some years ago by the Institute for SocialResearch at the University of Michigan. This study comparedfamilies between 1971 and 1978. It showed that more than 50%of families in the top quintile the first year had falleninto lower quintiles seven years later. Over the same period,almost half of those in the lowest quintile had risen to ahigher quintile.   This dynamic movement by people up and down the incomescale explains why the American people have never sympathizedwith class warfare. They know instinctively that those whoare on top today could easily be down and out tomorrow, andthat a little luck and hard work can turn today's poor intotomorrow's rich.   One need only look at the movement in and out of theForbes 400 list every year. In the past few years, more than50 names have been dropped from the list, victims of crashingreal estate and energy prices.   This is not to say that there aren't people who do remainpoor year after year or that there are families like the DuPonts who stay rich year after year. However, it is clearfrom the data that many of the poor do lift themselves out ofpoverty every year and that many of the rich find that wealthis fleeting.   ---   Mr. Bartlett is a deputy assistant secretary at theTreasury department.   ---                        Mobile Society                                                                                                         INCOME           DECLINED                        MOVED UP LEVEL BY         1 OR MORE          SAME         1 OR MORE QUINTILE          QUINTILE        QUINTILE        QUINTILE                                                                                                                                 1984-1985                                                                                                         Lowest             N.A.            81.8%           18.2%  Second            14.5%            60.9            24.6  Third             21.0             55.8            23.2  Fourth            23.8             60.5            15.8  Highest           19.5             80.5             N.A.                                                                                                                                 1985-1986                                                                                                         Lowest             N.A.            81.6%           18.4%  Second            15.2%            62.1            22.7  Third             22.8             55.3            21.9  Fourth            26.2             57.0            16.8  Highest           23.7             76.3             N.A.                                                                                                                                 1987-1988                                                                                                                                                                                                                Lowest             N.A.            83.0%           17.0%  Second            17.5%            63.3            19.2  Third             25.7             55.9            18.4  Fourth            26.8             59.9            13.3  Highest           24.3             75.7             N.A.</TEXT></DOC>
