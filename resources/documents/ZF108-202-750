(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Jim BoyceandM;When it comes to 3-D modeling and engineering design in the workstationarena, Computervision has long been recognized as a major player.andP;  In the DOSmarket, the company takes a modular approach to the topic with its PersonalDesigner system.andP;  The $3,900 microCADDS GCD module (Personal Designer'sgraphics editor) offers capabilities well above those found on comparablesystems.andP;  Coupled with the $1,900 microCADDS Surfaces, you have a system thatcomes close to bringing workstation CADD power to the PC.andM;The menu-driven installation process allows you to optimize your system andinstall optional packages such as Surfaces.andP;  Because the installation routineis well written, setup is painless.andM;Because of copy protection, however, installation gets a little tricky.andO;Computervision uses a combination of a hardware lock and software codenumbers to provide software security.andP;  To receive security codes the new usermust call Computervision; the company calls back to assign a string ofsecurity code numbers for each software module.andP;  Codes are installed on thesystem via a security configuration program.andP;  While it doesn't make settingup the software more difficult, it certainly does make the process moreinvolved.andM;Personal Designer supports both mice and digitizing tablets.andP;  The optionalscreen menus are a combination of icons and keywords, making the mouse a goodalternative to higher-priced tablets.andP;  In every case the icons are a goodrepresentation of what the function hidden behind them will do, which makeslearning the program a snap.andP;  An experienced CADD user can be up and runningin 2-D on the system in a single day.andM;Direct command entry on the prompt line allows more flexibility with many ofthe commands than is available from the menus.andP;  But like manyworkstation-based systems, command syntax and the sheer number of optionsavailable may make keyboard entry puzzling to the new user.andP;  Not to worry.andO;The screen interface is so complete that even seasoned users won't need totouch the keyboard very often on most projects.andP;  What makes learning thecommand syntax worthwhile is the ability to use other commands transparentlywithin the current one by simply typing in its modifier.andP;  Display options,grid size, and the use of entity selection filters are good examples of themany commands that can act transparently.andM;PERFORMING UP TO PARandM;Personal Designer performs a number of general geometry-manipulation actionsvery well.andP;  A host of construction line functions let you generateconstruction entities, and a wide range of functions help you easily copy,move, and edit existing data.andP;  You can use absolute or relative specificationfor both linear and polar location of points, and in many cases you need onlyenter the x or y coordinate.andM;Personal Designer's entity selection filters and techniques are probably someof the best and most versatile in the PC realm.andP;  You can select entitiesinside the selection window, outside the window, crossing, inside andcrossing, outside and crossing-and many other combinations.andM;An unexpected but very welcome feature comes in single-entity selection.andP;  Ifyou mistakenly choose an entity you don't want in the group, simply pressinga mouse button rejects it and takes it out of the set, allowing you tocontinue uninterrupted selection.andP;  If there are multiple entities that fallunder your pick box, Personal Designer has the intelligence to step throughthe possible entities as you reject them, rarely picking up the same onetwice.andP;  This feature takes all the aggravation out of selecting entities thatare either coincidental or very close together in the view.andM;Everything that Personal Designer does in 2-D it does well.andP;  Dimensioning andtext entry are everything you would expect from a system of this caliber andits icon-driven dimension setup screen gives you quick and easy control oftolerance styles and values, dimension styles, and physical dimensionfeatures.andP;  It also provides built-in geometric tolerancing groups that can beselected and inserted via icons.andP;  But for all its power and ease-of-use in2-D, what really sets Personal Designer apart from other CADD packages is thesurfacing and shading capability you will find in its microCADDS Surfacesmodule.andM;POWERFUL SURFACE AND SHADING FEATURESandM;The optional Surfaces module provides functions for creating tabulated,ruled, swept, extruded, and Coons-patch surfaces using lines, arcs, curves,and special curve-definition entities called cpoles.andP;  The sheer number offunctions for creating and modifying surfaces is impressive, but the factthat they are so simple to use is even more so.andP;  (Personal Designer'semphasis on surface modeling-it offers some of the most sophisticated toolsin this area available for a DOS machine-results in the absence of solidmodeling functions.)andM;Functions to create planes and use them to find their intersections with asurface, automatically generating a string at the intersection, exist;surface-to-surface intersection can also be defined by invoking the functionand simply identifying the surfaces involved.andP;  Also included are functions tofillet, join, and smooth surfaces.andM;Shading is handled externally by a program supplied with the surfaces option.andO;To generate a shaded image, you select the view of the object as a wireframein the editor and then invoke the Shade command.andP;  This allows you to setreflectivity, opacity, and other characteristics for individual surfaces.andP;  Asingle command then sends the necessary data to a separate file that theshading program uses.andM;MicroCADDS Surfaces uses gray-scale shading on VGA rather than color.andP;  Sincegray scaling trades color for higher resolution and smoother imaging, theresolution and appearance of the image is extremely good.andP;  This setup worksextremely well for design visualization.andM;The shading program also offers two modes for shading-faceted and smooth.andO;Faceted shading is quicker than smooth shading because the smooth optiongenerates a finer resolution.andP;  The only desired improvement here is tointegrate shading within the graphics editor.andM;Computervision offers other optional modules for Personal Designer, includinga Finite Element Analysis package and an extensive user program languagecalled UPL.andP;  UPL offers a sizable toolkit of functions and programmingfacilities to manipulate graphic data, perform calculations, access diskfiles, and more.andP;  With an extensive user-group network, finding UPL programsalready written to fit your special needs is easy.andM;Incorporated in the microCADDS GCD module of Personal Designer are DXF andIGES translators.andP;  A DOS-extended version of microCADDS GCD for 386-basedmachines is available for $5,800; you can also purchase versions designed forthe Sun SPARCstation and 386i.andM;With Personal Designer, Computervision has combined ease-of-use and powerfulsurfacing to successfully bridge the ever-narrowing gap between PCs andworkstations.andP;  If you need serious surface-modeling capability that's backedby one of the major players in the CADD game, this is the system for you.andM;How We Tested High-End CADD PackagesandM;The increasingly widespread use of fast 386-based PCs with speedy processingand addressable high memory has affected the CADD arena since our last reviewof high-end packages (PC Magazine, August 1988).andP;  Our testing platform was aCompaq Deskpro 386/25 with a 60MB hard disk, 4MB of 32-bit system memory, abuilt-in cache controller, and an 80387 math coprocessor; this is the kind ofhigh-end platform one needs to run top-of-the-line CADD software optimally.andM;Our evaluations of CADD software emphasize their 3-D capabilities.andP;  We askedeach reviewer to create a 3-D wireframe part model, a 2-D drawing of themodel, and a shaded rendering depicting the final product.andP;  If possible, the2-D drawings were to be instanced off the wireframes; that is, pulleddirectly off of the earlier images.andP;  Not surprisingly, some 3-D packagesdon't support instancing-or they claim to support it but don't do it verywell.andM;The mechanical part we asked our reviewers to draw was designed to test apackage's functionality as both a 2-D and a 3-D drafting tool.andP;  In 2-D, totest dimensioning, we included several dimensions (lines, diameters, andradii) in the drawing.andP;  We included an inclined surface with an intersectingcylinder to test the package's ability to deal with the resulting ellipticalcurve at the point of intersection, and to see how well the curved shapecould be shaded.andP;  We added holes in the part's base to test 3-D surfacingcapabilities.andP;  Had the base been totally solid, any program that couldsurface would have had no trouble.andP;  But with the holes present, severalprograms required the shaded base to be built from smaller pieces and thenstitched together.andM;Our reviewers also tested the ability of each package to import .DXF files(the neutral file format defined by Autodesk) by reading in a 2-D drawingcreated in AutoCAD, Release 10.andP;  As a further test, we asked each reviewer tohatch a complex bordered region with a circular island in the center(supplied as a .DXF file).andP;  Three years ago this test would have tripped uphalf the programs we reviewed.andP;  Today, most high-end packages pass without ahiccup.andM;We also submitted each package to a series of speed tests measuring the timeit required to regenerate a screen with a complex 2-D drawing displayed andto delete every entity on the drawing.andP;  The greatest differences amongpackages showed up in the Mass Entity Deletion test, with FastCAD's nearlyinstantaneous performance on one end of the spectrum and SilverScreen'sultraslow timing on the other.andP;  SilverScreen deletes each entity one by one,pausing to refresh the screen every time.andP;  (The package does have a Clearfunction that erases the screen in one step.)andM;FastCAD was the top performer across the board, handily winning all fourtimed tests (with a tie in one instance).andP;  This 2-D package excels at deletesand screen draws, but it was unable to perform our crosshatching hatchingtest directly, tripping on the &quot;island&quot; effect in the image.andM;After FastCAD, AutoCAD and CADvance were runners-up on the Mass EntityDeletion test.andP;  Tight Group Select algorithms in FastCAD, Drawbase 5000, andAutoCAD gave them the edge on the Entity Select test.andM;Screen generation of images becomes increasingly important as your imagefiles become larger.andP;  The Full-Screen Generation test winners were FastCAD,CADmax 3D, and MicroStation PC.andP;  CADmax 3D again distinguished itself bymatching FastCAD's performance on the Select Screen Generation test.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
