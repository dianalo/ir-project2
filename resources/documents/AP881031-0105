RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court agreed today to considerreviving an attempt by Congress to limit the president's authorityto withhold classified information from the nation's legislativebranch.   The court said it will review a ruling that invalidated a lawaimed at giving Congress more access to national securityinformation.   The justices are expected to announce their decision in 1989.   A federal judge had ruled the law violates the requiredseparation of legislative and executive powers.   The clash between Congress and the president over classifiedinformation is a longstanding one.   But the case acted on today has more recent origins in anational security directive adopted by President Reagan in 983.   The directive requires federal officials, before they areallowed access to classified information, to sign an agreement thatthey will not disclose the information.   The directive also established a standard form for officials tosign, promising they never will divulge classified or``classifiable'' information without written permission from properauthorities.   Some members of Congress bridled at the directive, particularlythe use of the word ``classifiable.''   They said the presidential order restricts the free-speechrights of federal employees and ``allows after-the-factclassification of information in order to punish whistleblowers formaking disclosures that embarrass their superiors.''   Opponents of the presidential directive said the secrecyagreement that federal employees were forced to sign would bar themfor life from revealing information to Congress which it isentitled to receive.   Congress then enacted legislation prohibiting use of fundsduring the 1987-88 fiscal year to implement the standard formsReagan had authorized.   The legislation, attached to a general government spending bill,was aimed at blocking the executive branch from withholding``classifiable'' information or from impeding congressional accessto such material.   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch declared the legislationunconstitutional last May.   ``The statute impermissibly restricts the president's power tofulfill obligations imposed upon him by his express constitutionalpowers and the role of the executive in foreign relations,'' Gaschsaid.   In other action today, the court:   _ Agreed to decide whether states must continue to providelawyers for indigent death row inmates after they have lost theirinitial round of appeals.   The court said it will hear an appeal by Virginia officials whosaid requiring states to pay for attorneys in such cases could leadto interminable delays in carrying out executions.   _ Killed a lawsuit against the government stemming from theWorld War II mass detention of Japanese-Americans in U.S. prisoncamps.   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that theveterans of the internment camps waited too long to file suitseeking compensation for property losses.   _ Rejected an appeal by Kansas prosecutors challenging statelaws that broadly justify using deadly force to defend someone'shome or personal property.   The justices, without comment, let stand Kansas laws that permituse of deadly force even by people not threatened with death orgreat bodily harm.   _ Let stand a ruling that a state may ban the possession ofchild pornography.   The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, rejected an appeal byan Illinois couple who say state officials are intruding into theprivacy of the home to impose censorship.   _ Declined to further expand its study of drug testing in theworkplace, rejecting an appeal by Justice Department employees whosay such tests would violate their rights.   The court, without comment, refused to intercede in the case,which has yet to be argued before a lower court.   _ Ruled that police in Pennsylvania did not violate the rightsof a man suspected of drunken dirving by failing to read themotorist his so-called Miranda warnings soon enough.   The justices, by a 7-2 vote in an unsigned opinion, agreed withPennsylvania law enforcement officials that a lower court wronglyrequired police to warn motorists of their right againstself-incrimination.   _ Allowed public school officials in California to ban leafletsand school yearbook advertisements that promoted a student-run,lunch-hour Bible study group.   The court rejected an appeal by two students who said theofficials violated their free-speech rights.   In the classified-information case, the American Foreign ServiceAssociation, representing members of the nation's diplomatic corps,joined with senators and House members from both political partiesin appealing to the Supreme Court to reinstate the law.   The Reagan administration defended Gasch's ruling.   ``Surely the First Amendment does not confer an unfettered righton an employee of the executive branch to disclose whatevernational security information he pleases outside authorizedchannels, whether to a member of the public or to a member ofCongress,'' the Justice Department said.   The law that Gasch threw out expired on Sept. 30 with the end ofthe fiscal year. But a similar rider was attached to the spendingbill enacted for the current fiscal year.   President Reagan announced Wednesday that he was pocket-vetoinganother measure intended to give new protection to federalemployees who expose government fraud and abuse.   The president said the bill, which is not tied directly to thecase acted on by the court today, violates the Constitution. SinceCongress has adjourned, it cannot vote to override the veto.   The case is American Foreign Service Association vs. Garfinkel,87-2127.</TEXT></DOC>
