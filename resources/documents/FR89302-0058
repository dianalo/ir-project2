The weighted-average margin of salesat less than fair value is shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' sectionof this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>On November 14, 1988, we made an affirmative preliminary determination(53 FR 45793). The following events have occurred since the publicationof that notice.On November 31, 1988, Tosoh Hellas requested that we postpone making ourfinal determination for a period of thirty days pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A)of the Act. On December 20, 1988, we issued a notice postponing the finaldetermination until February 22, 1989 (53 FR 51129). Both the cost of production and sales questionnaire responses from TosohHellas were verified in Greece between November 28, and December 2, 1988.On January 23, 1988, the Department held a public hearing. Petitionersand respondent also submitted comments for the record in prehearing briefson January 17, 1989, and in posthearing briefs on February 2, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted from the tariffSchedules of the United States Annotated (``TSUSA'') to the HarmonizedTariff Schedule (``HTS''), as provided for in section 12101<T3> et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS number. As with the TSUSA numbers, the HTS numbers are provided forconvenience and customs purposes. The written product description remainsdispositive.The product covered by this investigation is electrolytic manganese dioxidefrom Greece. During the investigation period, such merchandise was classifiableunder item 419.4420 of the TSUSA. This merchandise is currently classifiableunder HTS item number 2820.10.0000.EMD is manganese dioxide (MnO<T2>2</T2>) that has been refined in an electrolysis process. The subjectmerchandise is an intermediate product used in the production of dry cellbatteries. EMD is sold in three physical forms, powder, chip or plate,and two grades, alkaline and zinc chloride. EMD in all three forms andboth grades is included in the scope of the investigation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales of EMD in the United States were made at lessthan fair value, we compared the United States price to the foreign marketvalue as specified below. We made comparisons on all sales of the productduring the period of investigation December 1, 1987 through May 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>As provided in section 772 of the Act, we used the purchase price of thesubject merchandise to represent the United States price for the salesby Tosoh Hellas to unrelated customers in the United States, all of whichwere made through a related trading company. We used purchase price asthe basis for determining United States price since the following criteriawere met: (1) The merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the U.S.prior to importation; (2) the merchandise in question was shipped directlyfrom the manufacturer to the unrelated buyer, without being introducedinto the inventory of the related selling agent; (3) this was the customarycommercial channel for sales of this merchandise between the parties involved;(4) the related selling agent acted only as a processor of sales-relateddocumentation and a communication link with the unrelated U.S. buyer. Purchase price was based on the C.I.F. and F.O.B. (foreign port) priceto unrelated purchasers in the United States. Where applicable, we madedeductions for foreign inland freight and insurance, brokerage and handling,ocean freight, marine insurance, export licensing fees, U.S. inland freight,as well as additions for import duties, import taxes and value-added taxesnot collected on exports of the merchandise.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we determined that therewere sufficient home market sales of such or similar merchandise by TosohHellas to form the basis for foreign market value. For this reason, wehave not applied the special rule for certain multinational corporationscontained in section 773(d) of the Act as requested by petitioners (seePetitioners' comment 2 and the Department's response). Petitioners allegedthat home market sales were made at less than the cost of production. Wecompared the home market prices exclusive of value-added tax to the costof production, which included materials, fabrication costs, and selling,general, and administration expenses. Because all sales were found to bemade at or above the cost of production, the Department used all home marketsales in its fair value comparison. Home market price was based on the delivered and ``free on truck'' priceto unrelated purchasers in the home market. We deducted inland freightand home market packing, and added U.S. packing. We made a circumstanceof sale adjustment for differences in credit and value-added taxes betweenthe two markets. <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversions</ITAG>We used the exchange rate described in andSection; 353.56(a)(1) of our regulations.All currency conversions were made at the rates certified by the FederalReserve Bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">Negative Determination of Critical Circumstances</ITAG>Petitioners alleged that imports of EMD from Greece present ``criticalcircumstances.'' Section 735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstancesexist if we determine that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspectthat:(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation,or(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was importedknew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than fair value, and(B) There have been massive imports of the merchandise which is the subjectof the investigation over a relatively short period.Pursuant to section 735(a)(3)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports.For purposes of this finding, we based our analysis on the verified shipmentdata of the Greek respondent, for equal periods immediately preceding andfollowing the filing of the petition until the month of our preliminarydetermination. Using this data, we find that there has been a slight decreasein imports of EMD following the initiation of this investigation. Sincewe do not find that there have been massive imports, we need not considerwhether there is a history of dumping or whether importers of this productknew, or should have known, that it was being sold at less than fair value.Therefore, we determine that critical circumstances do not exist with respectto imports of EMD from Greece. We have notified the ITC of this determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we verified all information usedin reaching the final determination in this investigation. We used standardverification procedures, including examination of relevant accounting recordsand original source documents provided by respondents.<ITAG tagnum="84">Petitioners' Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>Because home market sales of alkaline EMD are identicalto U.S. sales of alkaline grade EMD and home market sales of zinc chloridegrade EMD are identical to U.S. sales of zinc chloride grade EMD, the petitionerscontend that alkaline and zinc chloride grades of EMD constitute two separate``such or similar'' categories of EMD. Petitioners state that this conclusionis mandated by law since the definition of ``such or similar merchandise''under section 771(16) specifically means ``merchandise in the first ofthe following categories,'' <T3>i.e., </T3>``merchandise which is identical in physical characteristics.''Following this reasoning, since the home market sales of alkaline gradeEMD by Tosoh Hellas are, when viewed alone, not viable (and the home market``such or similar'' category of identical merchandise to which we are limitedhas been exhausted), petitioner further argues that the Department is precludedfrom using home market sales of zinc chloride grade EMD as the basis ofcomparison with U.S. alkaline sales. Therefore, foreign market value foralkaline grade EMD should be based on the home market selling price ofthe related Japanese producer according to the multinational provision.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>We disagree. When analyzing the viabilityof a foreign market, the Department must determine whether adequate salesof comparable merchandise exist. The Department examines a category ofmerchandise composed of both such <T3>and </T3>similar merchandise in accordance with section 773(a)(1) becausethis category represents those sales which can serve as a basis for comparison.When testing market viability, section 771(16) of the Act does not precludeus from using a category containing both such and similar merchandise.In this case, the Department determined that alkaline and zinc chlorideEMD are comparable or ``similar'' merchandise. Information on the recordclearly supports this conclusion since the two types of EMD are producedin the same production process and differ only in their final finishing.This finishing merely establishes the grind and the pH to which the EMDis neutralized. Additionally, there is minimal, if any, cost differenceattributed to this finishing step, and these two grades are equal in commercialvalue. Both grades of EMD are used in the production of dry cell batteries.Accordingly, respondent's combined home market sales of alkaline and zincchloride grade EMD are adequate as a basis of comparison since these salesexceed five percent of sales of that merchandise to third countries.<T3>Comment 2. </T3>Petitioners argue that the multinational provisionapplies in this investigation and requires foreign market value to be determinedon the basis of EMD sales in Japanese home market of Tosoh Hellas' parent.Section 773(d) of the Tariff Act provides that the special rule is applicablewhenever:(1) Merchandise exported to the United States is being produced in facilitieswhich are owned or controlled, directly, or indirectly, by a person, firmor corporation which also owns or controls, directly or indirectly, otherfacilities for the production of such or similar merchandise which arelocated in another country or countries;(2) The sales of such or similar merchandise by the company concerned inthe home market of the exporting country are nonexistent or inadequateas a basis for comparison with sales of the merchandise to the United States;and(3) The foreign market value of such or similar merchandise produced inone or more of the facilities outside the country of exportation is higherthan the foreign market value of such or similar merchandise produced inthe facilities located in the country of exportation (19 U.S.C. section1677b(d)).Petitioners maintain that all of the above criteria are satisfied in thiscase. Regarding the second point, they state that, in determining homemarket viability, the Department erroneously applied the five percent standardspecified in andSection; 353.4. However, andSection; 353.4 is not applicableto a determination of home market sales adequacy for the purpose of applicationof the multinational rule, which is governed by andSection; 353.9 of theregulations. <T3>Department's Position.</T3> The Department agrees with the petitionersthat the first criterion of the multinational rule applies in this casesince the Greek respondent, Tosoh Hellas, is owned by a firm with additionalfacilities in Japan to manufacture EMD. As for the second criterion, however,the Department disagrees with the petitioners' conclusions as to the viabilityof the Greek home market. As explained above, the Department has determinedthat alkaline and zinc chloride EMD comprise one ``such or similar'' categoryof merchandise. Sales of this merchandise in the home market are well abovethe five percent standard for the home market viability test establishedin andSection; 353.4 of our regulations. Therefore, we determine that thespecial rule for multinational corporations contained in section 773(d)of the Act does not apply in this investigation. The Department is not precluded from using the five percent standard whenapplying the multinational rule as petitioners contend. In our recent preliminarydetermination concerning <T3>Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof From Thailand</T3>, 53 FR 45334 (1988),the Department determined that the special rule for multinational corporationsdid not apply where the home market in Thailand was viable based on thecriteria set forth in 19 CFR 353.4. In applying the multinational rule,section 773(d)(2) of the Act requires that sales in the home market beinadequate as a basis for comparison. The Department has only one viabilitytest for determining the adequacy of a home market, the five percent standardas set out in andSection; 353.4 of the Department's regulations, which ithas routinely applied when judging home market viability.While the language of andSection; 353.4 states, in part, that this sectionis to be applied to situations ``other than that provided for in andSection;353.9,'' this language does not affect the application of the five percenttest, but rather governs the choice of the appropriate market for determiningFMV where sales in the country of exportation are deemed inadequate. Section353.4 should be read in a manner that applies the five percent benchmarkto situations where there is a question concerning home market viabilitysuch as where the multinational corporations provision might be applicable.However, unless the five percent test of andSection; 353.4 indicates thereis no viable home market, the requirements of the multinational corporationsprovision have not been met. <T3>Comment 3.</T3> If the Dapartment bases foreign market value on homemarket sales in Greece, it should continue to compare the export pricesof alkaline EMD and zinc chloride EMD sold to the United States with, respectively,the prices of home market sales of the same grade of EMB. <T3>Department's Position.</T3> We agree. The Department selects that merchandisewhich is most appropriate for specific price comparisons in accordancewith section 771(16) of the Act. The Department followed its standard methodologyin this investigation by first matching identical merchandise sold in bothmarkets. Specifically, the Department matched EMD of the same grade (alkalineor zinc chloride grade) when both were sold in the U.S. and home markets.<T3>Comment 4.</T3> Petitioners advocate that the respondent's Gandamp;A,indirect selling expenses, and financing expenses be allocated over thereported volume of sales during the period of investigation. <T3>Department's Position.</T3> We see no reason to change the respondent'sallocation methodology. The petitioners are advocating the allocation ofperiod expenses on the basis of ``sales'' as defined by the Department'sdate of sale methodology, which is used for properly determining thosesales subject to the investigation. On its own books and records, a finishedgood usually is reflected as sold when it is shipped to fill a customer'sorder. Since, in this case, the allocation by shipment volume during thePOI did not prove distortive, we have accepted the respondent's allocation.<T3>Comment 5.</T3> Petitioners fault the treatment of manganese oxide(``MnO'') in the calculation of the cost of production (``COP''). Becauseof the small volume and low value of MnO sales during the period as wellas the fact that it is produced in the same process but only incidentallyto the production of EMD, petitioners argue MnO is properly treated asa by-product of EMD production. Therefore, manufacturing costs should notbe allocated to MnO, but rather the revenue received from the sale of MnOshould be used to offset total production costs during the period.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>The Department does not agree that MnOshould be treated as a by-product in the production of EMD. By-productsare basically waste products from the production of the primary productand possess only a residual value. The manufacture of MnO is the firststep in the production process of EMD. Manganese ore is converted in thissingle, distinct production process which yields only one product, MnO.EMD is not produced at this stage. MnO generally continues on in the productionprocess to be further transformed into EMD. Therefore, all costs incurredin the production process of converting manganese ore into MnO should appropriatelybe allocated to the MnO produced by this initial process. <T3>Comment 6. </T3>Inventory carrying costs should be inputed for TosohGreece's inventories of manganese ore, anodes, and finished goods inventories.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>When we calculate COP pursuant to section773(b) of the Act, the Department is only interested in determining theactual costs incurred to produce the merchandise under investigation. TheDepartment is not concerned with imputations necessary for determiningdifferences in selling expenses between markets and, for this reason, doesnot impute costs in the calculation of cost of production. See <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain All-TerrainVehicles from Japan, </T3>54 FR 4864 (1989). Since the respondent includedimputed credit expenses for home market sales in its calculation of COP,we have deleted this imputed credit expense from the COP used in our finaldetermination. <T3>Comment 7. </T3>Petitioners argue that the COP should be adjusted tocompensate for certain practices that cannot be continued on a sustainedbasis. In particular, petitioners question whether the reported level ofmaintenance can continue to meet the requirements of a plant when operatingat high production capacity. <T3>Department's Position. </T3>We based our COP on the verified actualcosts incurred by the respondent during the period of investigation. Sincethe respondent's accounting practice follows generally accepted accountingprinciples, which appropriately reflect the company's accounting methodsused in the ordinary course of business and which the Department did notfind to be distortive, the Department has based its COP on those costs.<T3>Comment 8. </T3>Petitioners argue that the Department has made an improperadjustment with respect to the Greek value-added tax (``VAT''). The petitionersstate that the Department has added an amount for VAT to the U.S. sellingprice while also adjusting FMV by the absolute difference between the GreekVAT on home market sales and the VAT added to United States sales. Petitionerscontend that the adjustment the Department made on the foreign market sideis not authorized as an adjustment for ``other differences in circumstancesof sale'' (19 U.S.C. section 1677b(a)(4)(B)). Moreover, the petitionerscite <T3>Zenith Electronics Corp. v. United States, </T3>633 F. Supp. 1382 (1986),as evidence that the Court of International Trade has specifically rejectedthis ``circumstances of sale'' approach to the treatment of VAT.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>The ruling of the Court of InternationalTrade in <T3>Zenith, </T3>now on appeal, does not bar Commerce from making a circumstanceof sale adjustment for the differences in VAT between markets. In practice,the Department has routinely recognized that differences in the tax burdenon home market and exported merchandise are properly accounted for by makingcircumstances of sale adjustments for these differences. See <T3>Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color, from Japan, </T3>53 FR4050, 4051 (1988); <T3>Color Television Receivers from Korea, </T3>53 FR 24975, 25976 (1988).<T3>Comment 9. </T3>Petitioners argue that home market sales at less thanthe cost of production should be excluded from the determination of foreignmarket value. <T3>Department's Position. </T3>The Department found no home market salesto be below the cost of production. <T3>Comment 10. </T3>Petitioners contend the Department has incorrectlytreated a royalty payment made by the respondent as a direct selling expenserather than as a manufacturing expense. Since the royalty expense is relatedto certain technical production rights being provided, the expense is moreproperly recognized as a cost of manufacturing. <T3>Department's Position. </T3>Having examined the agreement governingthe respondent's royalty payment, we agree with the petitioners and havedisallowed this adjustment as a direct selling expense in our final determination.We have treated it instead as a cost of manufacturing. <T3>Comment 11. </T3>The petitioners question the accuracy of the exportlicense fee reported per transaction since this amount does not correlatewith the total fee divided by the quantities sold. <T3>Department's Position. </T3>The total amount reported for each exportlicense fee was verified as was the per kilogram expense listed for severalU.S. transactions. The confusion stems from the transportation of two figuresin the total export fee reported in the narrative section of the respondent'squestionnaire response. Additionally, shipments of smaller quantities werenot charged the same fee. <T3>Comment 12. </T3>The Department incorrectly calculated the amount tobe added to United States price for the applicable Greek VAT that was forgivenupon exportation of the merchandise. Petitioners argue that the tax percentageshould be applied on the basis of the ex-mill price of the U.S. merchandise.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>The Department verified that the GreekVAT is applied to the selling price of the merchandise inclusive of transportationexpenses when the merchandise is sold on delivered terms. Therefore, theDepartment has properly calculated the applicable VAT on U.S. sales bymultiplying the tax percentage by the same tax base used in the home market,<T3>i.e., </T3>the selling price. <T3>Comment 13. </T3>No addition should be made to U.S. price for importduties and taxes rebated or not collected on graphite anodes used in production.Petitioners argue that this adjustment should be denied since the graphiteanodes are not raw materials and it is not apparent whether Greek law permitsa credit against duties and taxes paid in these circumstances.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>The Department verified that import dutiesand taxes are forgiven by the Greek government on graphite anodes consumedin the production of EMD that is exported. For this reason, we have addedto U.S. price those import duties and taxes forgiven on graphite anodeswhen EMD is exported.<T3>Comment 14. </T3>The Department should compute credit expense usingTosoh Hellas' interest rate rather than it's related trading company'sinterest rate because it could not verify the latter.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>We agree and have made the change in ourfinal determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Respondent's Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>Tosoh Hellas reports the date of sale for one of itshome market customers should be changed from the previously reported dateof the internal sales ``contract'' to the date of shipment. Respondentstates that sales to this customer were made on a spot basis and the quantitywithin the sales contract was based simply on an estimate to which thecustomer was not committed.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>We accept that the sales ``contract'' usedby the respondent for the home market customer in question is not a contractestablishing terms of sale. The ``contract'' was written by the respondentfor its own internal planning purposes and did not commit either partyto the terms contained therein. Accordingly, the Department agrees thatthe appropriate date of sale is the date of shipment for that customerand has made that change in its final determination.<T3>Comment 2. </T3>Since sales in the home market of alkaline grade EMDare not viable, the Department should use sales of zinc chloride EMD asthe basis of FMV.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>Having determined that the combined salesof alkaline EMD and zinc chloride EMD are viable, the Department comparedthe same grades of merchandise from within that category of sales to thecorresponding grades of U.S. merchandise when this was feasible. See theDepartment's Response to Petitioners' Comment 3.<T3>Comment 3. </T3>Respondent argues that since the sales of alkalinegrade EMD in the home market were not in the usual commercial quantities,these sales cannot serve as the basis for foreign market value. Respondentcites section 1677b(a)(1), which provides that the foreign market valueshall be the price ``* * * at which such or similar merchandise is sold* * * in the principal markets of the country from which exported, in theusual commercial quantities * * * for home consumption.''<T3>Department's Position. </T3>During the period under investigation,we note that U.S. sales of similar quantities were also made. For thisreason, we do not agree with respondent's argument regarding the referencedhome market sales and have used these sales in determining foreign marketvalue.<T3>Comment 4. </T3>Respondent further argues that sales of EMD to thishome market customer were made outside the ordinary course of trade and,therefore, should not be used as the basis for FMV. As support for thisargument, respondent states that the terms of sale are not consistent withthe terms of other sales made in the home market, that the sales priceto this customer differs based on this fact, and sales to this customerwere not made under terms similar to those employed in the U.S. market.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>As stated above, the quantities that weresold to this home market customer are similar in size to sales made toa U.S. customer. Furthermore, in comparing these sales, price appears tovary independently of quantity. Furthermore, the terms of sale for theU.S. sales of similar quantity and those of the home market customer citeddiffer more because of specific payment terms than for any other reason.Such differences are more reflective of the particular customer's credithistory rather than a basis for concluding that sales to that customerare outside the ordinary course of trade. Sales to this home market customerwere made at regular intervals throughout the period of investigation andthe Department has used these sales in its final determination.<T3>Comment 5. </T3>Respondent states that the legal prerequisites fora critical circumstance finding have not been met.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>We agree. See the ``Negative Determinationof Critical Circumstances'' section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>Since we have determined that critical circumstances do not exist withregard to this investigation, entries suspended prior to November 14, 1988,the date of publication of the preliminary determination in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> can now be liquidated and all securities postedas a result of the suspension of liquidation prior to that date will berefunded or cancelled. We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continueto suspend liquidation of all entries of EMD from Greece that are entered,or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after November 14, 1988.The Customs Service shall continue to require a cash deposit or postingof bond equal to the estimated amounts by which the foreign market valueof the merchandise subject to this investigation exceeds the United Statesprice, as shown below.
