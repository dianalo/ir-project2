The software will allow personal computer users to send spreadsheets, graphics and documents at a cost of about $1 a message within the U.S., the companies said. The software would allow receivers to edit and revise the data sent.    The suggested retail price of the software, Lotus Express for MCI Mail, is $100, including a year's subscription to MCI Mail. Lotus, based in Cambridge, Mass., said it expects to begin shipping by the end of February.    Under a joint marketing pact, Lotus and MCI will share the revenue from both the software and the electronic mail it generates; the percentage each will receive wasn't disclosed. The agreement bars Lotus from working with other electronic-mail companies in North America and MCI from working with other personal-computer software companies.    Lotus and MCI executives said they expect Lotus Express to compete with express mail services, which charge between $11 and $14 for overnight delivery of a computer disk or a printed document.    The mail-service software is one of several products that Lotus has introduced in the past several months to broaden its product line, which remains heavily dependent on the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet software. The prototype for the product was developed at Software Arts Inc., a company Lotus acquired last year.    MCI, a long-distance telephone company based in Washington, says its three-year-old electronic mail service handles 1,750,000 messages a month. </TEXT></DOC>
