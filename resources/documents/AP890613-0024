Ayres' reaction was typical of the praise that flowed fromenvironmentalists, industry spokesmen and lawmakers. Viewing Bush'sproposals as generally positive, they nonetheless took issue withparticulars.   Ayres, for example, said he was concerned the plan put too muchemphasis on new, cleaner fuels rather than cleaning pollution fromexisting gasoline engines.   Much criticism also came from groups with vested financialinterests, who said Bush went too far. The coal industry andofficials from mining states, for instance, predicted utilitycustomers would pay for the switch to low-sulfur coal.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell summed up the remarks ofmany when he called Bush's plan ``a significant departure from thenegative environmental policy of the Reagan administration, whichopposed every clean-air bill considered by Congress for the pasteight years.''   Mitchell, D-Maine, was chief sponsor of the major clean air billlast year, and his elevation to majority leader this year has led tonumerous predictions of an end to a decade-long congressionalgridlock.   Bush alluded as well to the previous inertia.   ``Too many Americans continue to breathe dirty air, and politicalparalysis has plagued further progress against air pollution,'' hesaid. ``We've seen enough of this stalemate. It's time to clear theair.''   The proposal would attempt to leave most cities free of urbansmog by the year 2000 and to sharply reduce acid rain pollution.   Bush recommended that automakers be required to build and sellmethanol-powered cars in nine urban areas plagued by dirty air. Heproposed that limits on tailpipe emissions of ozone-producinghydrocarbons in existing cars be tightened by almost 40 percent.   A proposed 10-million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide fromcoal-burning power plants, a major cause of acid rain, would mean a50 percent cut in these deadly emissions.   And Bush said industry should be required to use new technologyto curb the release of cancer-causing toxic chemicals into the air.   The most critical voices came from the National Coal Associationand Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. Byrd said the acid rain provisionswould unfairly penalize the high-sulfur coal areas like his state``by leading to massive switching from high-sulfur to low-sulfurcoal.''   Richard L. Lawson, president of the National Coal Association,called some provisions ``unnecessary, unduly harsh and economicallyonerous'' and warned that ``electric ratepayers will likely pay morefor electricity.''   Bush Chief of Staff John Sununu said the stiffer standards wouldadd 5 percent to 10 percent to utility rates in 18 states that burnhigh sulfur coal and contribute the most to the acid rain problem.But he said their rates would still fall below the national average.   The Clean Air Working Group, representing 1,950 companies andassociations, said it recognized ``the innovative, positive ideals''in Bush's plan.   But the group said the alternative motor vehicle fuels plan wasexcessive, and agreed with the coal industry that utilities _ underthe Bush plan _ would be unwilling to spend money on new, clean coaltechnology.   The technology would not achieve results until 2005, according tothe coal industry, too late to meet the year 2000 deadline forreducing sulfur dioxide.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., called the Bush plan ``a welcomedeparture'' from the Reagan administration's lack of action, butadded: ``I do not think the proposal goes far enough in ... controlson mobile sources (motor vehicles), which are the single largestsource of ozone and carbon monoxide pollution.   ``The tailpipe emission standards in force today are standardsestablished in the Clear Air Act of 1970.''   But Tim MacCarthy, director of federal liaison of the MotorVehicle Manufacturers Assocation, including the Big Three U.S.carmakers, said ``we don't support'' tougher tailpipe emissionsstandards.   He said the retirement of older cars, increased emissionsinspection and maintenance programs and pilot projects onalternative fuels are a much better idea.   But he said ``there is a very good likelihood there will be sometightening of tailpipe standards.''   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the chief sponsor of clean airlegislation in the Senate this year, said, ``The rhetoric is good,but it's a bit vague in the urban smog provisions.''   David Gardiner, of the Sierra Club, called the air toxics part ofthe bill ``the weakest'' portion of the proposal. He said industrywould not have to use the best possible technology to reduce toxicemissions, and predicted the Bush standards ``will not make a dent''in the problem.   William Reilly, chief of the Environmental Protection Agency,said cleaning the air ``will neither be free nor easy.'' Forexample, electric bills are expected to increase by 2 percent insome states to clean up coal-fired electric plants.   At a briefing before Bush's speech, Reilly estimated the overallprogram would cost between $14 billion and $19 billion a year afterit is in full effect at the turn of the century.</TEXT></DOC>
