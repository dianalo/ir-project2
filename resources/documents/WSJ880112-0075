At the moment, the proposed Decade of the Child is confined to New York state, but the governor's reputation as a suitable standard-bearer of Democratic beliefs suggests that his thoughts on children soon may seep into national politics.    In his annual speech to the state Legislature, Mr. Cuomo warned that &quot;a staggering number of our children are undereducated, underfed, undercared for. . . .&quot; What Mr. Cuomo has in mind to ameliorate this is an expansion of federal and state entitlement programs.    The government would take responsibility for the prenatal care of poor expectant mothers. It would offer poor mothers day care for their infants. The government of New York would place four-year-olds in free prekindergarten classes. Under a &quot;liberty scholarship&quot; program, the governor proposed that if a student graduates from high school, &quot;the state will supply whatever help you need to complete a college education in this state.&quot; The program also proposes state provision of health insurance to working poor and increased nutrition assistance for children the governor says are going hungry in New York state.    Gov. Cuomo is correct in saying that this country's poorest children are too often poorly educated and poorly prepared to enter the mainstream. There may be merit, for instance, in providing crucially important prenatal care and education to young pregnant women. We're somewhat surprised, however, that the governor chose to emphasize the importance of entitlements over what we often have thought to be his strongest suit -- the primacy of family values.    The net effect of the entitlement expansion Mr. Cuomo advocates in the name of children obviously would be to increase the government's already considerable presence in the lives of poor families. Indeed, if all of Mr. Cuomo's plans were carried through, he would ensure that lower-income children become virtual wards of the state, from birth through childhood. With the government acting as a surrogate parent in poor families -- assuming many responsibilities better left to parents themselves -- poor mothers and fathers will have lessened incentives to act productively and responsibly.    Recent conservative critics have argued that large-scale government aid can have deleterious effects on recipients. This is admittedly a complex and contentious subject, but the governor's vision of a greatly expanded entitlement strategy suggests that policy makers most clearly associated with traditional liberalism have no interest in giving the time of day to even their most well-intentioned critics.    The persistent phenomenon of impoverished children is largely attributable to the explosion in the number of illegitimate births and female-headed households. Any effort to ameliorate their plight must necessarily address and emphasize family structure. Those who proclaim themselves the champions of these children must finally give public recognition to the fact that to succeed most children need the routine presence at home of a parent -- for advice, for discipline, for admiration, support and affection. Gov. Cuomo's Decade of the Family says too much about state benefits and too little about the benefits of family. </TEXT></DOC>
