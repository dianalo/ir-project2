The bank estimates that home equity loans accounted for $23 billion in one-to-four-family home mortgage loans outstanding at the end of March, far lower than recent estimates of $40 billion by some bank and thrift analysts.    Many banks and savings and loan associations aggressively sought borrowers and advertised home equity loans in the wake of passage of the new tax code, which eliminated most consumer interest deductions but preserved the deductibility of interest payments on home equity loans.    There has been concern that consumers have embraced home equity lines of credit with too much abandon and that banks and thrifts have made the loans too easy to obtain.    The survey is believed to be the first comprehensive survey of home equity loan activity since passage of the new tax code. It found that in the 274 thrift institutions regulated by the New York bank 3.26% of the mortgages outstanding at the end of March were home equity loans. The bank arrived at its estimate of $23 billion by extrapolating that percentage to mortgages outstanding at all other thrifts and at commercial banks.    &quot;I couldn't find any support for the $40 billion figure&quot; that has been widely quoted in the press, said Eugene J. Sherman, the bank's chief economist. He cautioned that his estimate is an extrapolation and that the actual amount of home equity loans outstanding could vary. But he noted that thrifts in the New York area promoted the home equity loans aggressively, and said he doubts that using those results for other thrifts and commercial banks would seriously understate the actual amount.    Mr. Sherman said the bank's survey showed the loans had become markedly more popular since passage of the tax code. He said home equity loans at the thrifts surveyed rose 23% between December and March and that the number of institutions offering the loans rose from 119 to 140, a 17.6% increase.    At the end of March, one-to-four-family home mortgages outstanding at the nation's federally regulated thrifts totaled $467.7 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
