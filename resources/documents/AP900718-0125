The incident, which Soviet television called life-threatening,occurred while Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin were tryingto fix thermal insulation on the outside of their spacecraft.   It was the latest in a series of problems plaguing thecosmonauts' six-month mission.   Despite the danger, the cosmonauts joked about it afterward.Solovyev quipped that flight controllers ``need to put road signsthere'' on the outside of the huge craft, Soviet television'sevening news program Vremya said.   ``Midnight Emergency in Outer Space,'' was the headline of afront-page story in Wednesday's Izvestia newspaper. The articleraised the possibility human error could be behind the hatchproblem and that the cosmonauts might have to take anotherspacewalk for more repairs before they can return to Earth safely.   ``Was there a threat to the crew's lives? Yes, there was,''Vremya said.   A U.S. specialist on the Soviet space program said the hatchproblem may prevent Solovyev, the 42-year-old flight commander, andBalandin, the 36-year-old engineer, from taking another spacewalk.   The Soviet Union's manned space program, which for decades hasbeen a source of national pride, has been plagued the past twoyears by equipment malfunctions, mistakes by cosmonauts and budgetcuts.   The cosmonauts on Tuesday left Mir, the space station orbitingfor four years, to fix thermal insulation around the capsule theymust use to return to Earth.   Nearly half the insulation on the Soyuz TM-9 capsule, which isdocked to Mir, has peeled off, news reports have said.   After repairing some of the damaged insulation, the cosmonauts,who were working without tethers or hoses connected to the ship,encountered the hatch problem.   ``During their return to the spaceship, the crew experiencedunexpected difficulties,'' Radio Moscow said. ``The cosmonautsfailed to shut the door of the entrance chamber and had to make useof an emergency door to enter the station.''   James Oberg, author of several books on the Soviet spaceprogram, said although the cosmonauts managed to climb back intoMir safely, the hatch problem could complicate future spacewalks.   ``The general crisis was not fully resolved,'' Oberg said in atelephone interview Wednesday from his Texas home.   He said the cosmonauts may be unable to take another spacewalkbecause equipment needed to recharge their spacesuits with air andother vital supplies is now inaccessible in the damaged airlock.   Soviet officials at the Soviet Mission Control Center inKaliningrad, north of Moscow, tried to minimize the problem.   ``No one is concerned here. It is an abnormal situation butcontrollable,'' Vsyeva Latyshev, a center spokesman, said in atelephone interview.   Izvestia said it took Solovyev and Balandin three hours to reachtheir damaged capsule after crawling out of Mir and scamperingalong its outer skin using fasteners like mountain climbers. Theymanaged to fold part of the damaged insulation using clamps butanother damaged piece wouldn't budge.   Radio Moscow reported the cosmonauts determined the insulation,which protects the capsule while in space, was damaged duringlaunch of the Soyuz on Feb. 11. The thermal blanket, flappinguselessly in space for months, could have interfered with thecosmonauts' safe return to Earth.   Izvestia said life support resources of the cosmonauts'spacesuits approached their six-hour limit.   They were running so low on air that they had to ``feed'' theirspacesuits outside the ship, Izvestia reported, apparently drawingoxygen from the vessel.   In their rush, the cosmonauts apparently did not remove theirladders from the outside, Izvestia reported. It said groundcontrollers ``cannot rule out'' that Solovyev and Balandin willhave to take another spacewalk in the next few days. It did not saywhether the walk would be needed to remove the ladders or to repairthe balky hatch.   The malfunctioning hatch is on Kvant-2, a module attached toMir, and must be closed so the cosmonauts can pressurize thechamber.   The cosmonauts apparently closed an inner hatch to seal one endof the airlock that leads to the troublesome outside hatch. Thatairlock apparently contains equipment they use for their spacewalks.   On Tuesday, the spacemen were unable to close the hatch afterthey entered the airlock ``either because of the rush, tiredness orsome other unknown reason,'' Izvestia said.   Tass said Solovyev and Balandin had to re-enter through anotherhatch on Kvant-2 that leads into a compartment for scientificequipment.   The repairs and re-entry took seven hours, about two hourslonger than scheduled.   Latyshev said ground controllers planned to bring the twocosmonauts home in the Soyuz capsule as scheduled Aug. 9.   A replacement crew for Mir is to be launched Aug. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
