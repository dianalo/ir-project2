This proposed rulewould redesignate that license as General License G-TEMP and amend it byremoving the registration requirement and by establishing guidelines forthe use of the general license. One effect of removing the registrationrequirement would be that parties abroad who were not eligible to registerunder the former General License GTE would be able to use G-TEMP as authorizationfor a permissive reexport in accordance with the appropriate provisionsof the regulations. This proposed rule would permit news media personnelto take their equipment to all destinations and permit shipments of kitsconsisting of parts that would be eligible for export as one-for-one replacementparts under General License GLR.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments should be received by November 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Written comment (six copies) should be sent to: PatriciaMuldonian, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,Department of Commerce, P.O.

This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661.2. This rule contains collection of information requirements under thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These collections were approved by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) under Control Numbers 0694-0010 and 0694-0029.Public reporting for these collections of information is estimated to average25 minutes per response for 0649-0010 and 15 minutes per response for 0694-0029.This includes the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing datasources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing andreviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding theseburden estimates or any other aspect of these collections of information,including suggestions for reducing these burdens, to Office of Securityand Management, Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce,Washington, DC, 20230; and to the Office of Management and Budget, PaperworkReduction Project (0694-0010 and 0694-0029), Washington, DC 20503.3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.4. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), including those requiringpublication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunity for publiccomment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exempt from theseAPA requirements because it involves a foreign affairs function of theUnited States. Because this rule is being issued in proposed form, thisrule complies with section 13(b) of the Export Administration Act. Further,no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunityfor public comment be given for this rule.5. This rule does not contain policies with federalism implication sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">Invitation to Comment</ITAG>Because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations, thisrule is issued in proposed form and comments will be considered in thedevelopment of final regulations.
