The vice president has maintained he was not aware of theconcerns of then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretaryof State George Shultz until much later.   Had he been aware of their objections, Bush has said, he mighthave advised the president against the sale. ``When you don't knowsomething, it's hard to react. We were not in the loop,'' Bush saidlast August.   Among documents released Wednesday was an agenda penned bythen-National Security Adviser John Poindexter for his Jan. 17,1986, briefing of President Reagan and Bush. It includes an itemthat states ``Shultz andamp; Weinberger still recommend against.''   The agenda also states that Attorney General Edwin Meese III andthe late CIA Director William Casey ``approve,'' and lists a ``newfinding'' _ or document to authorize the covert arms sales.   Reagan signed the document that day.   The scrawled 26-word agenda is marked ``Done'' at the top.   Bush in January said this of the meeting: ``The president mayhave signed a finding but there was no discussion of a finding infront of me. I do not recall any suggestion of a finding that day.''   Bush maintains that specific details were not discussed in thebriefing, which he considered to be an informal session, TheWashington Post reported today, citing an unidentified aide to thevice president contacted Wednesday.   The newspaper noted that a memo released earlier and related tothe same meeting stated that ``the secretaries do not recommend youproceed with this plan.'' That memo, prepared for the president,carried a Poindexter notation that Reagan had been briefed orallyand that Bush was among those present.   Poindexter is among those under indictment in the Iran-Contraaffair.</TEXT></DOC>
