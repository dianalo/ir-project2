High temperaturetreatments show that the maximum processing temperature must stay belowthe incongruent melting peak, which is shown to vary with atmosphere.It is also shown that partial pressure of oxygen affects the crystalstructure of the sintered material. Low temperature treatments (555/sup0/C) reveal a change of the Ba/sub 2/YCu/sub 3/O/sub x/ material froma superconductor to a semiconductor, the most intriguing being a materialwhich shows a change in sign of do/dT at 88 K, thus offering interestingapplications in electrical circuits. 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
