Another important and new effect was also presentedfor the first time: particle mixing in the neutral Bd meson. This reportcontains: the standard model (measurements and precision tests, neutrinonumbers, Higgses, axions), weak matrix elements calculations in RCD,quark mixing and CP violation, neutrino masses, neutrinos oscillations,search for conventional processes.</TEXT></DOC>
