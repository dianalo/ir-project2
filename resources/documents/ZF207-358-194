 But not every resource sharing solution requires themonetary and personnel investment of a full-featured LAN like Novell'sNetWare or 3Com's 3+Open.andM;There is growing field of inexpensive, entry-level LANs which use interfacecards, such as Artisoft's (Tucson, AZ) LANtastic or Computer Pathways'(Bothell, WA) Grapevine.andP;  These LANs typically provide file transfer andsharing, printer sharing and electronic mail for about $300 per PC.andP;  Theselow-cost LANs have two disadvantages: $300 per PC can still be prohibitivelyexpensive if your budget is small, and you need to install interface cards.andM;An even lower-cost alternative is a LAN which uses PCs' serial ports ratherthan interface cards.andP;  RS-232 LANs, or zero-slot LANs as they are oftencalled, offer a cost of under $200 per PC.andP;  RS-232 LANs provide file transferand peripheral sharing with minimal effort in the installation andadministration departments.andP;  For infrequent resource sharing, an RS-232 LANdoes the job inexpensively and effectively.andM;Quite simply, RS-232 LANs are serial networks with multiuser functionality.andO;They can theoretically support all multiuser functions over PCs' serialports.andP;  RS-232 LANs are physically configured in two ways: a bus or a star.andO;Those wired in a star often use a central intelligent switch, an A-B box on agrand scale, to connect PCs and printers.andP;  The central switch can either bean external box or a central server.andP;  With an external switch, the RS-232 LANresembles a data PBX (Private Branch eXchange), another low-cost data sharingdevice.andP;  RS-232 LANs wired in a bus usually have no external hardware, andare generally just software and cabling.andP;  Whatever the physical topology, thecommon thread among RS-232 LANs is that they are designed to connect amaximum of 35 devices, whether printers or computers.andM;RS-232 LANs are typically used b those with small needs and a small budget.andO;Brandon Ewing, marketing manager for zero-slot LAN maker Server Technology(Sunnyvale, CA) describes the typical users as &quot;small offices of lawyers,doctors and businesses.andP;  They're generally small networks, with at most sixPCs, a laser printer and a dot matrix printer.andP;  Most are already using Lotusand WordPerfect.&quot;andM;The RS-232 LAN's software provides peripheral and file sharing.andP;  In addition,many zero-slot LANs come bundled with electronic mail.andP;  Some, like AppliedKnowledge Groups' (Nashville, TN) ZeroNet, are NetBIOS-compatible which makeschoosing applications software much easier.andP;  Many RS-232 LAN operatingsystems support remote communiations.andP;  With a modem and the NOS loaded,remote users have complete access to the network.andP;  Because the communicationssoftware is bundled, there's no need for a separate communications packagelike DMA's (New York, NY) pcAnywhere, Meridian's (Norwood, MA) Carbon Copy orNorton-Lambert's (Santa Barbara, CA) Close-Up.andM;While the majority of the RS-232 LANs installed are small, some RS-232supporters think big.andP;  One such advocate is John Earl, a microcomputerconsultant in Detroit.andP;  Earl installed an RS-232 LAN in one of the largestbanks in Detroit.andP;  &quot;We had a bunch of PCs and printers we wanted to connect,&quot;Earl says.andP;  &quot;Originally I had thought of a LAN, but the bank wouldn't hear ofit.andP;  They were convinced a minicomputer and a LAN were of the same evil.andP;  SoI started looking for an alternative solution.andP;  At the time, we were usingDigital Product's (Watertown, MA) printer sharing devices.andP;  So I used DigitalProduct's NetCommander, their RS-232 LAN.&quot;andM;This Detroit bank's RS-232 LAN is far from small.andP;  The network, as Earldescribes it, is wired in a star.andP;  It includes over 1,000 PCs and 400 to 450printers, including IBM ProPrinters, QuietWriters and ProPrinter XL24s.andP;  Atthe center of each star is a NetCommander, which can connect up to 32devices.andP;  Each NetCommander is daisy-chained.andP;  The largest distance betweenany one computer and its NetCommander is 300 feet.andM;&quot;Today, the network is used for over-the-counter banking needs, includingchecking account balances, credit checks and the effectiveness ofpromotions,&quot; says Earl.andP;  &quot;In the latter instance, tellers gather thestatistics about the client and batch the information to a central '286 forreview.andP;  The system runs at 9.6K bits per second.andP;  While LANs may be faster,the files are small enough -- about 500 characters -- for the speed to workjust fine.&quot;andM;Zero-slot LANs aren't without problems.andP;  For one, they are much slower than aLAN.andP;  In the worst case, entry-level LANs have interface cards that transmitdata at 1M bits per second.andP;  Entry-level LANs also use standard hardware,such as Arcnet, which transmits data at 2.5M bits per second.andP;  RS-232 LANstransmit data at a maximum of 115.2K bits per second.andP;  The RS-232 LAN's slowspeed is because of the chip set on the serial card.andP;  The chip set isdesigned for the RS-232 or RS-242 standards.andP;  On an AT, the speed is 56K bitsper second; on an XT, the speed is 19.2K bits per second.andP;  The115-Kbits-pers-second speed is through the ingenuity of RS-232 LANmanufacturers.andP;  This speed increase is gained through polling.andP;  With polling,the CPU routinely checks to see if data has arrived.andP;  However, polling takesCPU cycles, and an overhead of about 20 percent of the machine's processingpower is incurred.andM;The slower speed of RS-232 LANs limits their functionality.andP;  Zero-slot LANsare unable to support sophisticated applications or heavy traffic.andP;  Sharing a50,000-record database would be frustrating.andP;  A zero-slot LAN is best suitedto sharing small files, such as those created in word processors.andM;Slow speeds mean an excruciatingly long time for large file transfers.andP;  MostRS-232 LANs get around the problem by supporting background file transfers.andO;With background file transfer, the user enters the requisite commands, thenhe or she continues working.andP;  While the user works, the PC moves the file toits destination.andP;  Without background file transfer, the user may notaccomplish any work on the PC until the file transfer is completed.andM;Today, the entry-level LAN has wedged in between the LAN with interface cardsand the LAN without.andP;  the gap is growing.andP;  When distributed processingbecomes of age, the power and ability of LANs will emerge.andP;  Then LANapplications will be vastly better than anything available on a serialnetwork.andM;The tradeoff boils down to performanc and functionality versus cost.andP;  LANswith cards are more costly, harder to install and manage, but provide morefeatures.andP;  LANs without cards are inexpensive, easy to install and manage,but have slower speeds and less functionality.andP;  Entry-level LANs, likeWaterloo's (Norcross, GA) Port Lite or Novell's NetWare ELS, offer an upgradepath to a full-featured LAN operating system, if the need arises.andP;  Most ofRS-232 LANs do not.andP;  One exception is Computer Pathway PrinterLAN andGrapevine, LANs without and with cards, respectively.andP;  Whether you need anentry-level LAN or an RS-232 LAN depends on your needs.andP;  If peripheralsharing is a high priority, and file transfer and sharing is minimal, then anRS-232 LAN is a good solution.andM;RS-232 LANs and DataandM;PBXsandM;Data PBXs and zero-slot LANs used to be easily distinguishable.andP;  PBXs wereintelligent switches connecting dumb terminals to minicomputers andmainframes.andP;  RS-232 LANs were software and cabling that connected intelligentdevices to peripherals.andP;  PBXs linked hundreds of devices; zero-slot LANs onlyconnected a few computers and peripherals.andM;Today, though, the two have merged.andP;  Data PBXs no longer support only dumbterminals; they link small groups of intelligent devices as well.andP;  Many dataPBXs include their own software, which was unheard of a few years ago.andO;Mainstreet from Newbridge Networks (Herndon, VA) is one example.andP;  Mainstreetis an external data switch which links different devices, includingterminals, PCs and peripherals.andM;There are some general differences between a data PBX and an RS-232 LAN.andO;Data PBXs tend to be hardware-based, while zero-slot LANs tend to besoftware-based.andP;  Data PBXs generally connect more devices than zero-slotLANs.andP;  While a data PBX will connect at most several thousand devices,zero-slot LANs may only be able to link several dozen.andP;  Zero-slot LANs alwayshave a software component, data PBXs sometimes do not.andM;Still, there are no hard-and-fast rules for distinguishing the two.andP;  Size isthe singular most important factor.andP;  Most RS-232 LANs connect under 35computers, although they can link far more devices.andP;  MainStreet connectsbetween 40 and 100 users.andP;  If daisy-chained, RS-232 can service severalthousand devices.andM;RS-232 LANs and PrinterandM;Sharing DevicesandM;If PBXs and zero-slot LANs are the high end of the low-end networkingsolutions, then printer sharing devices are the low end of the low-endnetworking solutions.andP;  Printer sharing devices are hardware boxes whichenable peripherals to be shared among users.andP;  They are the absolutelowest-cost networking alternative.andM;Printer sharing devices differ from zero-slot LANs in one area: file sharing.andO;As the name suggests, printer sharing devices originally connected severalcomputers to a printer.andP;  Thus, they supported communication flowing in onedirection, from the computer to the printer.andP;  In the past, they did notsupport modem pooling, background file transfer, nor any of the otherapplications associated with RS-232 LANs.andP;  Today that has changed.andP;  Manyprinter sharing devices can now support background file transfer.andP;  They mayalso support modem pooling and an electronic mail application.andM;Some peripheral sharing devices do not support true file locking, and byextension, file sharing.andP;  These networks are clearly high-end printer sharingdevices.andM;RS-232 ChoicesandM;Purchasing an RS-232 LAN involves many of the same issues as purchasing anyother information network.andP;  First identify your needs.andP;  Decide why you arepurchasing a network, and what you hope it will accomplish.andP;  Upon your havingdefined the objectives, think about the future needs.andP;  What will you need ina year from now?andP;  In two years?andP;  Here are some product-oriented issues inRS-232 networking:andM;1.andP;  File sharing.andP;  There are two schools of thought when it comes to filesharing over RS-232 LANs.andP;  Some think it can be done effectively even at theslow rates of serial ports.andP;  Others claim 115.2K bits per second is too slowfor file sharing.andM;If file sharing is important, be sure the network supports file and recordlocking to ensure data integrity.andP;  When one user opens a file, it should belocked so subsequent users cannot write to the file as well.andP;  Without filelocking, two users may simultaneously edit the file, but only the changes ofthe last user to save the file will be written to disk.andP;  Record locking isparticularly important for database applications.andP;  Typically, several userswill be in the same database file simultaneously, and if record locking issupported, each may edit a different record of the database.andM;Some RS-232 LAN manufacturers claim to support file locking as provided byDOS 3.1 and above.andP;  Often, though, it is not true file locking.andP;  The softwaremay take a file, for example JUNK.TXT and rename the file with a LOCextension to become JUNK.LOC.andP;  The .LOC does nothing more than notify theuser that the file is already open.andP;  It does not actually prevent a user fromopening the file.andM;If file sharing is not all that important, then consider a high-end printersharing device.andP;  It has the same functionality as the RS-232 LAN minus thefile sharing capability.andM;2.andP;  Electronic mail.andP;  Virtually all RS-232 LANs have some kind of electronicmail (E-mail).andP;  Whether you need E-mail and which E-mail package you choosedepends on your application.andP;  If you decide E-mail is needed, then be sureit's RAM-resident.andP;  If not, users will have to exit from their application toread or send mail.andP;  People will not be as likely to use E-mail then.andP;  Ease ofuse is also critical.andM;3.andP;  Print spooling.andP;  An RS-232 LAN must support print spooling.andP;  It makesusing a printer bearable.andP;  When a user prints a job, he or she must waituntil the printer is finished before continuing to work.andP;  As long as theprinter is printing, the computer remains inaccessible.andP;  With printerspooling, the computer isn't limited by the printer's speed.andP;  The file iscopied or spooled to a RAM or disk buffer.andP;  Spooling to the disk saves RAM,but it is slower than spooling to RAM.andP;  In either case, the user may continueto work, and the buffer will feed the printer the information as the printeris ready.andM;4.andP;  Security.andP;  Securing the network from intruders, hackers and mischievoususers has become the networking craze.andP;  RS-232 LANs do not have thesophisticated security features of their full-blown LAN cousins, but thathasn't left them out of the paranoia game.andP;  Most zero-slot LANs support somesecurity.andM;Axon's (Beverly Hills, CA) LAN Model s100 can protect even files withpasswords.andP;  With Axon's product, you can have a separate password for eachmachine, directory, subdirectory and file.andP;  The user can't copy or even readthe file until the appropriate passwords are supplied.andM;In ConclusionandM;As laser printers have gained in popularity, RS-232 LANs got a shot in thearm.andP;  Everybody wants to own a laser printer, but at $2,000 and up, it'shardly economical to give each user a dedicated one.andP;  RS-232 LANs distributethe cost of these expensive peripherals among a number of users.andP;  Ten PCssharing a laser printer brings the cost down to $200 a user, which issignificantly less than the original $2,000.andM;Digital networks may offer a new boon for the RS-232 market.andP;  With IntegratedServices Digital Networks (ISDN), all information needs will be serviced bydigital networks instead of analog networks.andP;  Modems will become unnecessary.andO;Using RS-232 LAN software, computers could connect with each other directlyover the telephone wire.andP;  At present, ISDN is being tested in areas aroundthe country.andP;  Different companies have developed their own proprietarymethods.andP;  A standard has yet to be developed.andP;  When it is, the RS-232 LANjust may become the RS-232 WAN.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
