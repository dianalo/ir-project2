(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Handguns are now banned in this affluentChicago suburb, where the quiet was shattered 11 months ago when aderanged woman went on a shooting rampage in an elementary school.   After only minutes of debate, Village Council voted 6-0 Tuesdaynight to adopt an ordinance banning the private ownership ofhandguns.   ``I hope this will make Winnetka a better place, and we willleave a better heritage for all of you,'' Village President ClarineHall told a group of young children who gave flowers to councilmembers after the vote.   The children, their parents and others pushed for passage of theban.   On May 20, 1988, Laurie Dann walked into a Winnetka elementaryschool classroom, killed an 8-year-old boy and wounded severalother children. She later wounded a young man at his home, thenkilled herself.   She carried three handguns she bought in neighboring Glenview.   ``It is almost a year, and I am satisfied that this has hadthoughtful consideration,'' said Ms. Hall, referring to the ban.   Oliver Ralli, 9, a fourth-grader, said he was ``mad that LaurieDann wounded kids and killed one in school. I just wanted to banhandguns.''   Board member Sandra Levin said she would rather see state andnational laws banning handguns, ``but I don't foresee this in thenear future.''   ``That's why we have to start on the local level,'' Ms. Levinsaid.   The vote came a week after Winnetka residents, in a nonbindingreferendum, voted 2,125 to 1,407 in favor of banning handguns inthe town, north of Chicago on Lake Michigan. Schoolchildren madeposters and signs, urging people to vote for the ban.   The new ordinance bans the sale and possession of handguns. Itexcludes police officers, gun collectors and security guards.   Violators face a fine of $300 to $500 for a first offense.   The measure, which takes effect immediately, calls for thevoluntary surrender of nonexempt guns to the Police Departmentwithin three months.   Winnetka has few crimes. Last year, the village of 13,000 had noreported robberies or rapes. Police haven't fired a gun for atleast a year, and before the Dann incident, the last homicide wasin 1957.   James Zangrilli, a resident of Oak Park and a national boardmember of the National Rifle Association, said that such a ban wasunconstitutional and would turn ordinary citizens into lawbreakers.   Five other Chicago suburbs have handgun bans, including MortonGrove, which in 1981 became the first U.S. community to prohibitthe weapons. Evanston and Oak Park followed suit, while Ms. Dann'sshooting rampage provided the impetus for two northern suburbs,Wilmette and Highland Park, to prohibit handguns.   State lawmakers recently introduced legislation that calls for amandatory waiting period before all handgun sales.</TEXT></DOC>
