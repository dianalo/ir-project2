But it is questionable whether the lawmakers will have the nerveto go through with any plan that could reduce federal revenue at thesame time they are grappling with the huge federal deficit.   Congress is considering two proposals on corporate taxation aspart of its examination of the leveraged buyout phenomenon. Oneproposal would restrict the tax deduction that corporations nowenjoy on interest payments stemming from borrowing. The other wouldease the levy on dividends, which are taxed both at the corporatelevel and as income to individual investors.   Lawmakers returned to work in January eager to muffle theexplosion of corporate debt that accompanied the multibillion-dollarbuyouts of major companies at the end of last year. After a week'sworth of hearings on the subject, the combination of curtailedbenefits for debt and a new tax break for dividends seemed to begaining favor.   It's also the approach preferred by key Bush administrationofficials, such as Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who areanxious to guard against another calamity on Wall Street like thecrash of 1987, which was precipitated in part by talk of changingthe tax rules on takeovers.   Proponents of the two-pronged plan say tightening the corporateinterest-deduction provision could balance revenue lost fromeliminating the double taxation of dividends. But both remaincontentious issues.   While Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told theSenate Finance Committee he was concerned about the level ofcorporate borrowing stemming from takeovers, he said he was opposedto any restrictions on the deductibility of corporate interest fromloans and bonds.   He said such limits could have unintended consequences that couldactually reduce tax revenue, and that companies and financiers wouldfind a way around any restrictions.   Earlier in the week, David S. Ruder, chairman of the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, also said he was opposed to any change inthe interest deductibility. He warned that any tinkering with thetax laws to curb takeovers could cause panic in a stock market hecalled ``skittish and nervous.''   That caution was echoed Friday by President Bush, who said at anews conference that he didn't think it was the government's placeto restrict the level of corporate borrowing.   As for the other proposal, eliminating the double taxation ondividends most likely would lead to price rises in stocks that paydividends because the dividends would be more valuable. That, inturn, could have another beneficial effect: making it moreattractive for corporations to raise funds for buyouts andrestructurings through sales of stock instead of through borrowing.   Greenspan, Brady and Ruder all welcomed the plan to ease the taxburden on dividends. But none offered any magic formula to do sowithout worsening the federal deficit.
