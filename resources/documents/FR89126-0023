Background</ITAG>Under our current regulations (42 CFR 405.552 and 405.553), anesthesiologyservices personally furnished by a physician are reimbursed on a reasonablecharge basis under Part B of the Medicare program (Supplementary MedicalInsurance). In addition, payment on a reasonable charge basis under MedicarePart B can be made for the physician's personal medical direction thathe or she furnishes to a qualified individual (for example, a certifiedregistered nurse anesthetist (CRNA)).As a condition for reasonable charge payment, the physician may not directmore than four concurrent anesthesia procedures at a time, must be physicallypresent in the operating suite, and may not perform any other servicesduring the same period of time. In addition to these requirements and prohibitions,the physician is required to perform several personal services to the patientbefore, during, and after the procedure such as examining the patient andpersonally participating in the most demanding parts of the procedure.Medicare carriers processing anesthesia claims calculate the reasonablecharge for anesthesia services based on the following:andbullet; Base value units assigned to the specific procedure performedthat represent the value of all anesthesia services except the value ofthe actual time spent administering the anesthesia.andbullet; Time units that represent the elapsed period of time from whenthe anesthesiologist prepares the patient for induction and ending whenthe anesthesiologist is no longer in personal attendance to the patient.The carrier allows no more than one time unit for each 15 minute interval.andbullet; The carrier may also use modifier units that take into accountspecial factors such as the age or physical condition of the patient. About65 percent of the carriers recognize modifier units.The sum of these units is multiplied by the lesser of the individual physician'scustomary charge conversion factor or the prevailing charge conversionfactor and compared with the billed charge to arrive at the reasonablecharge for the physician's anesthesia service. The individual physician'scustomary charge conversion factor is derived from the physician's billedcharges and underlying base, time, and, if appropriate, modifier units.The prevailing charge conversion factor is computed by arraying the anesthesiacustomary charge conversion factors in ascending order and weighting eachby the frequency of services on which it was based. An actual amount inthe array that is high enough to include the customary charge conversionfactors of the anesthesiologists who perform at least 75 percent of thecumulative services determines the prevailing charge conversion factor.When the anesthesiologist medically directs concurrent anesthesia services,the amount of reasonable charge reimbursement depends on whether the anesthetistunder medical direction is or is not the employee of the anesthesiologistand the number of concurrent anesthesia services performed. The numberof base units are reduced by 10, 25, or 40 percent depending upon whethertwo, three, or four concurrent procedures are performed. If the anesthesiologistperforms the entire service personally or medically directs concurrentservices using his or her employee (anesthetist), one time unit for each15 minute interval is allowed. If the anesthetist is not employed by theanesthesiologist, the carrier allows no more than one time unit for each30 minute interval rather than one unit for each 15 minutes.In cases in which a physician directs more than four concurrent procedures,all the reasonable and necessary preanesthesia services personally furnishedby the physician up to and including induction of the patient qualify forreasonable charge reimbursement. Those services furnished subsequent toinduction of the patient are considered physician services to the providerand are payable to the provider on a prospective payment basis if the servicesare furnished to an inpatient of a hospital that is subject to the prospectivepayment system or on a reasonable cost basis for all other hospitals. Section8312.1G of the Medicare Carriers Manual (HCFA Pub. 14-3) further specifiesthat payment for these preanesthesia services is limited to three baseunits plus one time unit for induction if the induction was personallyperformed by the physician. No further time units are recognized for anyof the concurrent procedures.On December 22, 1987, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Pub.L. 100-203) was enacted. Section 4048(b) of Pub. L. 100-203 requires theSecretary, in consultation with groups representing physicians who furnishanesthesia services, to establish a relative value guide for use in allcarrier localities in making payment under Medicare Part B for physiciananesthesia services furnished on or after January 1, 1989. The provisionis to be budget neutral. The guide must be designed to result in paymentsthat do not exceed the amount of the expenditures that would have occurredabsent this provision of the law. This proposed rule would implement theprovision of section 4048(b) of Pub. L. 100-203.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of this Proposed Rule </ITAG>A. Selection of Relative Value Guide and Coding Issues In processing anesthesia claims, carriers currently have the authorityto choose the relative value guide they use for assigning base units toanesthesia services. The principal relative value guides in use at thistime include various versions of the American Society of Anesthesiologists'(ASA) Relative Value Guide, particularly the 1967, 1970, and 1973 versionsof that guide; the 1964 or the 1969 California Relative Value Scale (CRVS);various State guides; and charge-based relative value guides. These guidesassign anesthesia relative value base units to surgical procedures. Becauseof this, our carriers require physicians to report the anesthesia serviceusing the surgical procedure codes from the Physicians Current ProceduralTerminology, Fourth Edition, or commonly referred to as CPT-4. The CPT-4 also includes an anesthesiology coding system developed by ASAthat categorizes anesthesia procedures by body part. There are 17 broadcategories ranging from anesthesia procedures on the head to anesthesiaprocedures associated with miscellaneous procedures. These categories arecomposed of approximately 248 codes. This compares with up to 4200 surgicalprocedure codes under which carriers currently classify anesthesia services.ASA has also developed a relative value guide to complement the CPT-4 anesthesiacodes which assign a specific number of base units to each of the 248 codes.ASA's relative value guide also provides for the use of modifier unitsfor physical status and additional units for qualifying circumstances.In addition, ASA's relative value guide provides base unit values for pulmonaryfunction testing and therapeutic and diagnostic services. However, theCPT-4 codes assigned to these services represent medical and surgical services,not anesthesia services. Therefore, we are proposing not to establish relativevalues for these categories of service. Some carriers currently recognize additional payments beyond the currentanesthesia fee for specialized forms of monitoring, such as intra-arterial,central venous, and Swan-Ganz. Under the CPT-4 coding system, these servicesare reported by medical or surgical codes. Under the adoption of the uniformrelative value guide, we would allow carriers to continue with their currentpolicies. Carriers who do not currently recognize additional payment forspecialized forms of monitoring would maintain their current practice.We are concerned, however, that the continuation of this practice willresult in payment policies that are not uniform for services that representan integral part of the anesthesia service for a surgical patient. Therefore,we are requesting comments on the option of <T3>not </T3>recognizing separate reasonable charge payments for specializedmonitoring. Rather, payment for specialized monitoring would be includedthrough the anesthesia conversion charge factor. The Department signed an agreement with the American Medical Association(AMA) on February 1, 1983 that permitted the Medicare and Medicaid programsto use the AMA's copyrighted CPT-4 for reporting physicians' services.It was the understanding of the parties involved that use of the CPT-4anesthesia codes would be implemented unless experience indicated conversionwas inappropriate. HCFA was to conduct analysis and research to determinewhether the conversion from CPT-4 surgical codes to CPT-4 anesthesia codeswould result in higher program expenditures. Although preliminary researchdescribing variation in carrier anesthesia payment practices was conductedunder a contract awarded by HCFA to a research firm, HCFA has not completeda full assessment of the impact of the carriers' conversion to the CPT-4anesthesia codes on program expenditures. We believe that enactment ofsection 4048(b) of Pub. L. 100-203 provides us with the opportunity inimplementing a uniform relative value guide to convert to CPT-4 anesthesiacodes without increasing program expenditures. We have discussed the choice of the relative value guide, as well as possiblealternatives, with representatives of ASA. We are proposing to select the1988 ASA Relative Value Guide as the uniform guide to be used for makingpayment under Medicare Part B for several reasons. First of all, the 1988ASA Relative Value Guide is linked to the CPT-4 anesthesia codes. All otherrelative value guides are linked to the surgical procedures. Also, thenumber of procedure codes under this system is significantly less thanunder the current system, and this simplifies program administration. A further advantage of the 1988 ASA Relative Value Guide is that its designlends itself to determining relative value units for new procedures. Becausethe ASA guide is more oriented to grouping surgical procedures or bodysystems rather than oriented to the specific surgical procedure furnished,a relative value ordinarily can be assigned to a new procedure based onthe existing relative value unit for the code in the surgical proceduregroup or body system category that is most comparable to the new procedure.However, in adopting this relative value guide, we would reduce the numberof base units assigned to all lens surgery to four units. Under the currentASA guide, lens surgery has a units value of six. On October 7, 1986, wepublished a final notice in which we uniformly reduced the number of baseunits for cataract surgery from eight units to four units (51 FR 35693).We plan to continue this policy. Also, in the final notice, we had reducedthe number of base units for iridectomy anesthesia to four units. UnderASA's system, iridectomy anesthesia would be reported under ``Anesthesiafor procedures on eye; not otherwise specified.'' This category of servicesis currently assigned a base unit of five units. We are requiring carriersto continue to recognize four base units for iridectomy anesthesia andfor physicians to identify iridectomy anesthesia separately from otheranesthesia procedures on the eye.In addition, for reasons discussed below, no modifier units would be recognizedunder the uniform relative value guide. Ordinarily, ASA revises its relativevalue guide annually. While we are proposing to adopt ASA's 1988 RelativeValue Guide, as modified, we are reserving the right to accept or rejectfuture revisions made to the guide by ASA and to modify existing relativevalues for technological changes or other reasons.The relative value guide is set forth in the Appendix to this proposedrule.Although we are proposing to adopt the ASA's relative value guide, we areconcerned that the decrease in the number of codes to report anesthesiaservices would lead to a loss of coding information and carriers wouldbe unable to make proper coverage decisions in all cases. For example,use of surgical codes currently allows a carrier to identify, at the frontend, both surgical and anesthesia services associated with cosmetic surgery.This capability is lessened to some degree with the movement to anesthesiacodes. However, this problem may be dealt with in different ways. To ensurethat anesthesia services have not been inappropriately paid, we could requirethe carriers to conduct postpayment reviews. For services furnished onor after April 1, 1989, section 1842(p) of the Act, as added by section202(g) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, requires physiciansto include the appropriate diagnosis code on their bills or Part B claims.We expect that the inclusion of diagnosis codes with bills or claims wouldallow the carriers to better identify noncovered anesthesia services ifwe adopt the use of CPT-4 anesthesia codes. While we are proposing theuse of CPT-4 anesthesia codes, we are considering requiring the continuationof the use of CPT-4 surgical codes to report anesthesia services. We invitecomment on the extent to which the CPT-4 anesthesia codes could be modifiedto prevent inappropriate coding or fragmentation of services and more readilypermit the detection of noncovered services. We are also interested inreceiving comments on whether the adoption of the CPT-4 anesthesia codeswill lessen or enhance our ability to eliminate the use of time units (seediscussion below).In proposing to use the 1988 ASA guide with the described modifications,we considered a number of alternatives. We considered adopting the 1988ASA Relative Value Guide but assigning the values to the surgical codes.We believe, however, that on balance adoption of both the anesthesia codingsystem and the relative value guide is perferable because it simplifiesthe coding system.We also considered developing a new base unit relative value guide fromthe relative value guides currently used by carriers. The guide would havebeen developed from the most commonly used guide or a composite of commonlyused guides. However, adoption of this option would have required us todevelop our own guide and that would not have been feasible given the timeconstraints imposed on us by the requirements of section 4048(b) of Pub.L. 100-203. In addition, ASA is strongly opposed to this option becauseit would continue the use of surgical codes instead of anesthesia codesto describe anesthesia services.We also considered adopting the complete ASA 1988 Relative Value Guide,including the use of modifier units and units for qualifying circumstances.Modifier units are allowed based on the patient's physical status (forexample, one unit is added if the patient has a severe systemic disease).Additional units are allowed for qualifying circumstances, such as forpatients of extreme age (for example, one additional unit is added if thepatient is over age 70), for unusual risk factors (for example, use oftotal body hypothermia or controlled hypertension), or for less than optimumoperative condition (for example, under emergency conditions).We have discussed the use of modifier units with ASA and are not adoptingmodifier units as included in the 1988 ASA Guide. As noted previously,under ASA's system, different levels of modifier units may be recognizedbased on the patient's physical status. The use of modifier units underthese circumstances appears to be subjective and difficult for carriersto validate in a claims review operation without substantial cost and effort.ASA has proposed to refine the circumstances under which modifier unitsare recognized, and has drawn up revised guidelines that define more preciselythe specific patient conditions that warrant modifier units. For example,two additonal units would be added if the patient had a myocardial infarctionless than three months before the operation. One additional unit wouldbe added if the patient had unstable angina. ASA also recommended the eliminationof modifier units for induced hypertension or hypothermia and suggestedthat the age-risk requirement for modifier units be raised from age 70to 75.We believe that the elimination of modifier units would not have a substantialadverse effect on individual anesthesiologists. Currently, about 35 percentof carriers do not recognize modifier units, and anesthesiologists in thesecarriers' areas would not experience any change. Second, the proportionof total anesthesia units associated with modifier units is relativelyminor; with ASA's proposed changes, the proportion should be less than10 percent of total units. Third, whether modifier units are included issignificant only if there are substantial differences in the distributionof patients among anesthesiologists. This would occur only if some anesthesiologistssee a very different mix of patients undergoing the same surgical procedures,for example, anesthesiologists who consistently see patients with anginaand other conditions qualifying for modifier units more than other anesthesiologistsin the area. Differences in the mix of patients undergoing surgery arealready largely accounted for by differences in base and time units. AlthoughASA strongly believes that anesthesiologists in some hospitals, particularlyteaching hospitals, do see patients more likely to have severe systemicdisease and possibly more advanced age within a surgical category, we currentlydo not have evidence that this is the case to any substantial degree.We also believe it would be difficult to preserve budget neutrality underASA's proposed modifier unit system. This is because each carrier wouldhave to estimate the number of modifier units that it would have allowedif ASA's modifier unit policy had been used to process claims during 1988.Finally, we are concerned with the precedent that modifiers could establishfor other specialities with respect to Medicare patients. For example,surgeons could argue that Medicare cases should be charged higher amountsbecause that are longer and more complex than non-Medicare cases.Another alternative we considered was to adopt the 1988 ASA Relative ValueGuide only as it pertains to base units and to allow each carrier to continueits current modifier unit policy. We believe, however, that this wouldonly continue the variations among carriers with respect to their policieson modifier units, and that this alternative would be inconsistent withthe statutory requirement that we develop a uniform relative value guide.Still another approach would be to develop a relative value guide thatwould recognize only base units. Under this approach, no time or modifierunits would be recognized and payment for anesthesia services would bebased only on reasonable charge conversion factors and base units. Underthis system, we would create a new system of relative value units fromthe sum of the uniform base unit and the average time unit for the anesthesiaprocedure. There are a number of considerations that would justify elimination oftime units. First, the starting and ending points of the anesthesia timeinterval are not sharply defined, but are decided by the anesthesiologist.For example, anesthesia time starts when the anesthesiologist begins toprepare the patient for the induction of anesthesia in the operating roomand ends when the anesthesiologist no longer is in personal attendanceto the patient. Also, our current policy on time units allows the anesthesiologistan additional time unit for any portion of time that exceeds the allowabletime unit. For example, if an anesthesiologist personally performs a procedurewhich lasts an hour, he or she would be allowed one unit for every 15 minutes,resulting in four time units. However, if the same procedure took 61 minutes,the anesthesiologist would receive an additional unit, thus resulting infive time units.In fact, our current policy on recognizing time units was the focus ofa recent study conducted by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG).(Copies of this report entitled ``Medicare Part B Payments for UnexpendedPhysician Efforts Relating to Anesthesia Services'' (A-07-88-00080 issuedon August 9, 1988) can be obtained by writing to the Office of the InspectorGeneral, 330 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20201.) Based on thestudy, OIG recommended the following options to change the current timepolicy:andbullet; Pay for actual time expended, rather than treating all fractionalunits as whole units. That is 65 minutes would equal four and one-thirdtime units instead of five units.andbullet; Round all fractional units down to the next lower whole unit.That is, disregard all fractional time units (for example, any amount oftime between 61 and 74 minutes would equal four units instead of five units).Another alternative considered by OIG that would make anesthesia paymentsmore commensurate with the effort expended would be to pay only for thosefractional units in excess of one-half as whole units. That is, any fractionequal to or less than one-half time unit (seven and one-half minutes) wouldbe disregarded (for example, 65 minutes would equal four units, but 68minutes would equal five units).We believe that elimination of time units would be consistent with theway in which we pay for other physicians' services. We do not ordinarilypay surgeons additional amounts based on the time it takes to perform thesurgery. Surgeons bill and receive payment that does not vary with thelength of the surgery. In our view, there is no policy or operational reasonwhy the same principle should not apply to anesthesia services. While wehave decided to retain the use of time units at this time for purposesof implementing the uniform relative value guide, we are considering thealternatives discussed above which would limit the potential for inappropriateuse of time units for billing purposes. We are specifically requestingcomments on these alternatives. We will initiate more aggressive monitoringof the accuracy of time reporting in the future. Moreover, we are announcingour intention (subject to publication of another proposed rule) to eliminatethe separate time unit element of the anesthesia payment system withintwo years of the effective date of the final rule implementing the uniformrelative value guide. The elimination of time units will be the subjectof a separate notice of proposed rulemaking and comments submitted in responseto that proposed rule will, of course, be carefully considered before finalimplementation of a revised time unit policy. Assuming that the ASA RelativeValue Guide is adopted as proposed, we will carefully consider whethermodifications of that guide are needed to facilitate the elimination oftime units (for example, by some limited expansion of the number of codes).If the evidence suggests that elimination of time units is feasible onlywith the use of CPT-4 surgical codes, a conversion back to the use of thosecodes will be proposed in order to achieve the goal of eliminating timeunits (for example, because the statistical variation in the average timefor procedures collapsed in the 248 anesthesia codes is too large).As noted, adoption of ASA's current relative value guide will require thateach carrier crosswalk its surgical codes to the anesthesia codes thatare used by the ASA guide. ASA has furnished us with a table that crosswalksthe CPT-4 surgical codes to the anesthesia codes. For example, the CPT-4anesthesia code 00100, anesthesia for procedures on integumentary systemof head and/or salivary glands, including biopsy, subsumes the followingCPT-4 surgical codes: 15780, 15790, 15791, 15820, 15821, 15822, 15823,15824, 15826, 15828, 15840, 15842, 15845. We will make this table availableto the carriers to assist them in carrying out the coding conversion.B. Budget NeutralitySection 4048(b) of Pub. L. 100-203 provides that the uniform relative valueguide is to be designed so as to result in Medicare payments for anesthesiaservices not exceeding the amount that would have occurred under the currentsystem of reimbursement. In order to comply with this statutory requirement,we would require that carriers adjust their customary and prevailing chargesduring the profile update process for 1989. Customary and prevailing chargeswould be computed as if the 1988 ASA Relative Value Guide, without modifiers,had been used to process claims for services furnished during the 12-monthperiod ending June 30, 1988. This is the 12-month period that is used toupdate the customary and prevailing charges on January 1, 1989. There aresome carriers that are unable to make this adjustment as part of the profileupdate process because time and modifier units are merged. We would requirethese carriers to make the adjustment based on a representative sampleof anesthesia services.The prevailing charge as limited by the Medicare economic index (MEI) wouldbe adjusted by the ratio of the unadjusted prevailing charge under thenew system to the unadjusted prevailing charge under the old system.<ITAG tagnum="81">Example</ITAG>The prevailing charge conversion factor as limited by the MEI is $20. Theunadjusted prevailing charge conversion factor, that is, the 75th percentileof the customary charge array under the prior system, is $30. The revised``budget neutral'' unadjusted prevailing charge conversion factor is calculatedat $33. The ``budget neutral'' MEI adjusted prevailing charge is calculatedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,i1,3,1,3,1,3</C> <H1>$20 andmultiply;</H1><H1>$33</H1><H2>$30</H2><H1>=</H1><H1>$22</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>Revised maximum allowable actual charges (MAACs) would be calculated bymultiplying the previous year's MAAC by the ratio of the updated customarycharge determined under the carrier's previous system to the updated customarycharge determined under the uniform relative value guide.C. Delay in the Effective Date of the Uniform Relative Value Guide  We are proposing to delay the implementation of the uniform relative valueguide until March 1, 1989. Thus, for services furnished on or after January1, 1989 and before March 1, 1989, anesthesia services would continue tobe paid on the basis of CPT-4 surgical codes and under the carrier's relativevalue guide. The carriers would update customary and prevailing chargeconversion factors on January 1, 1989 in the usual manner.  We are proposing the delay to allow the carriers additional time to recalculatebudget neutral customary and prevailing charge conversion factors. In addition,since HCPCS will be updated in March 1989, the delay would also enablecarriers to implement the coding change and the budget neutral conversionfactors at the same time. If we were to adopt the statutory effective date,then our proposal would be implemented in two steps; that is the uniformrelative value guide would be implemented on January 1, 1989 and the codingrevisions on March 1, 1989. We believe that the additional time will providefor a more orderly transition between the current system and the uniformsystem.  The continuation of the current system for an additional two months wouldnot adversely affect anesthesiologists or Medicare beneficiaries. Sincethe uniform relative value guide is to be implemented in a budget neutralfashion, the aggregate payment under the current system in January andFebruary 1989 should not differ from payments that would have been madeunder the uniform relative value guide.  D. Updating the Uniform Relative Value Guide  One of the issues associated with our adopting a uniform relative valueguide is the process by which the relative value guide is reviewed andrevised. The ASA has advised us that they make only minor annual revisionsto the Relative Value Guide and our analysis confirms this fact. For example,the 1988 Relative Value Guide lists only seven codes for which the baseunit values have been changed from the 1987 version and four circumstancesfor which procedure code descriptions have changed.  It would be necessary to assign base units to new procedures as they aredeveloped. The nature of the CPT-4 anesthesia codes is such that when newprocedures are developed, the coding system generally would assign thenew procedure to the body part code with which it is most closely associated.If there is no existing code that appropriately describes a new procedure,the carriers would, through their medical consultants, establish a localcode and relative value base units. We would review that carriers' practiceswith those procedures every three years and establish uniform relativebase units.  HCFA may, of course, propose modifications to existing relative value unitsbecause of changes in technology or for other reasons. For example, thetechnology involved with a given code may change and support a reductionin the base units assigned to the code. As noted, we believe that the numberof revisions of this nature will not be significant on an annual basis.Also, we do not expect that the magnitude of these revisions would be enoughto affect the customary and prevailing charge conversion factors.  The base unit adjustments would be similar to the cataract and iridectomyanesthesia base unit adjustment we made in October 1986. We would announcethese adjustments through publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of proposed and final notices as required underthe regulations at andSection;405.502(h), which concern the establishmentof special reasonable charge limits for physician services. A systematicadjustment to customary and prevailing charge factors may be required onlywhen the cumulative number of revisions to the relative value units supportssuch an adjustment.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any proposed rule that meets one of theE.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to resultin_ andbullet; An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or andbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Section 1842(b) of the Act requires that any relative value guide we proposeas a basis for paying anesthesiologists must be implemented in such a wayas not to result in payments to anesthesiologists for services providedto Medicare patients that are higher than the amounts they are currentlyreceiving. In section II.B. of this preamble, we explain how we would implementthis provision to comply with that requirement. Because we are requiredto maintain budget neutrality with respect to anesthesiology payments,we do not expect any economic impact to follow from this proposed rule.Therefore, this rule would not meet any of the criteria described in E.O.12291 for a major rule, and, accordingly, we have not prepared a regulatoryimpact analysis.B. Regulatory Flexibility Act We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistentwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unlessthe Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposesof the RFA, all anesthesiologists are treated as small entities. As explained in our discussion of E.O. 12291, section 4048(b) of Pub. L.100-203 requires the Secretary to implement the new relative value guidefor determining anesthesiology payment in a manner that will not resultin any change in payments to anesthesiologists. Thus, the proposed ruleshould have no economic impact on anesthesiologists. For this reason, wehave determined, and the Secretary has certified, that a regulatory flexibilityanalysis is not necessary. Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatoryimpact analysis if a proposed rule may have a significant impact on theoperations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysismust conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposesof section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospitalwith fewer than 50 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area.We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we have determined,and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not have a significanteconomic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small ruralhospitals.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Other Required Information</ITAG>A. Public Comment Period In adopting substantive rules, we ordinarily publish a notice of proposedrulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>with a 60-day period for public comment as requiredunder section 1871(b)(1) of the Act. Section 4039(g) of Pub. L. 100-203,however, provides that we may issue regulations on an interim or otherbasis as may be necessary to implement certain provisions of Pub. L. 100-203relating to Medicare. We believe that this express legislative authorityis fully applicable here with respect to implementation of section 4048(b)of Pub. L. 100-203. Consequently, in order to implement the provisionsof section 4048(b) by March 1, 1989, we are shortening the period for commentto 30 days.  As previously discussed, section 4048(b) requires that we implement a uniformrelative value guide for use in making payment for physician anesthesiaservices. This provision also requires that, in developing the relativevalue guide, we consult with groups representing physicians who furnishanesthesia services. We have acted expeditiously within the compressedtime frame imposed by Congress to meet with physician anesthesia groups,to solicit their input on the design of the relative value guide, and todiscuss with them the numerous options that have come under consideration.We have also sought to expedite the process of internal agency considerationof the draft rule through the use of shortened time frames. Notwithstandingthese efforts, implementation of the relative value guide with a 60-daycomment period would prevent publication of a final rule by the proposedimplementation date of March 1, 1989. We therefore believe that shorteningthe public comment period from 60 days to 30 days is both necessary forthe required execution of agency functions and in the best public interest.We will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specifiedin the ``Date'' section of this preamble. Because of the large number ofcomments that we normally receive during a comment period, we are unableto acknowledge or respond to each comment individually. However, we willrespond to comments in the preamble to the final rule.B. Paperwork Burden This proposed rule does not impose information collection requirements.Consequently, it need not be reviewed by the Executive Office of Managementand Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44U.S.C. 3501-3511).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 405 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Health facilities, Health professions,Kidney diseases, Laboratories, Medicare, Nursing homes, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Rural areas, X-rays.42 CFR Part 405, Subpart E would be amended as set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 405_FEDERAL HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THE AGED AND DISABLED </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart E_Criteria for Determination of Reasonable Charges; Reimbursementfor Services of Hospital Interns, Residents, and Supervising Physicians</ITAG>1.
