For this case a numerical solution of a problemon time evolution of {alpha}/sub n/(t) populations, providing constantplasma parameters (N/sub e/, T/sub e/) and initial {delta}-type leveldistribution of the populations, is carried out. Such statement of aproblem is equivalent to definition of nonstationary Green function forpopulations, describing relaxation of population excitation after momentarysingle change of the level population. The advantage of a new approachis that it sufficiently decreases the calculation time with the reasonableaccuracy of statistical solution, that, finally, permits to analyse evolutionof population distribution in quantum system with very high number ({similar_to}10/sup2/) of energy levels.</TEXT></DOC>
