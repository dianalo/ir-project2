U.S.Department of Justice threatens to drag on forever, growingmore opaque with age.   The story began happily enough in 1982, when WilliamHamilton, a computer software inventor who owns and runsInslaw with his wife, Nancy, landed a $10 million contract toprovide the Justice Department with a computer program totrack court cases. The dispute over precisely what happenednext has spawned a cottage industry for Washington lawyers.</LP><TEXT>   In seven years of claims and counterclaims, two federalcourts have affirmed the Hamiltons' basic assertion: TheJustice Department under Attorney General Edwin Meese stoleInslaw's &quot;Promis&quot; case-management software, which almost halfof the regional U.S. attorneys' offices continue to use. TheHamiltons' tiny Washington, D.C., company was awarded morethan $6 million in compensatory damages, but the governmenthasn't paid a penny while it has appealed the case for asecond time.   After years of no-holds-barred legal defense, the JusticeDepartment has lately shown interest in quietly resolving thecase. It now proposes turning the dispute over to acourt-appointed mediator.   But the Hamiltons refuse to settle. They want a publicairing of their allegations that a conspiracy reaching allthe way to then-Attorney General Meese's office aimed todrive Inslaw out of business and make off with its software.The department, Mr. Meese and other current and formerofficials have denied the charges.   The Hamiltons' best hope for a complete hearing may comefrom the House Judiciary Committee, which has beeninvestigating the Justice Department's computer-procurementpractices. In addition to the Inslaw dispute, the committee'sstaff is examining alleged irregularities in the JusticeDepartment's biggest high-tech overhaul ever. Project Eagle,as it's known, is expected to cost at least $212 million overeight years, and possibly much more.   In Judiciary Chairman Jack Brooks, the Hamiltons have apotential champion. The crusty Texas Democrat likes nothingbetter than a good scrap with a big bureaucracy --particularly during a Republican administration. The Inslawmess, he contends, has already set back computermodernization at the Justice Department by &quot;as much as 10years.&quot;   Widely considered a technological backwater, even bygovernment standards, the Justice Department badly needsoutside supervision of its computer operations, contendsTerry Miller, a Falls Church, Va., high-tech consultant.&quot;Justice ranks among the worst&quot; federal agencies in thisregard, he asserts.   Though they claim things are improving, departmentofficials admit that most of the agency's numerous bureausand subdivisions use incompatible equipment, resulting inlost time, money and occasionally even lawsuits. Untilrecently, some prosecutors &quot;were getting whipped in court&quot; byprivate lawyers armed with more sophisticated research andword-processing support, says Stephen Colgate, a seniordepartment administrator.   The department hired Inslaw in 1982 to begin to addressthe problem with its Promis computer software, which remainsthe leading commercially available legal case-managementprogram. Almost immediately, the contract became tangled intechnical disputes, prompting Justice to cease certainpayments and ultimately driving Inslaw into bankruptcy court.   The Judiciary Committee is investigating whether this wasan example of hamhanded federal procurement or, as theHamiltons allege, evidence of a massive conspiracy.   The courts, without directly addressing the role of Mr.Meese or his top aides, have ruled for Inslaw. In 1987, afederal bankruptcy judge found that midlevel JusticeDepartment officials, by means of &quot;trickery, fraud anddeceit,&quot; stole the Promis case-management software andpurposely tried to force Inslaw's liquidation. Judge WilliamBryant last November affirmed the decision, notingenigmatically that testimony and depositions indicated&quot;Inslaw performed its contract in a hostile environment thatextended from the higher echelons of the Justice Department.&quot;   The department has exonerated itself in two internalreviews, prompting conflict-of-interest allegations from theHamiltons. They have asked the federal court here to order anew criminal investigation. (A Senate government affairssubcommittee investigation last year failed to find proof ofa criminal conspiracy against Inslaw. But the subcommittee'sstaff said they had been hindered by Justice Departmentemployees fearful they'd lose their jobs if they talked.)   Based on privately funded detective work, the Hamiltonssay they believe that investors with personal links to theReagan administration conspired with Meese Justice Departmentofficials to ruin Inslaw. The investors' alleged goal was toacquire Promis -- possibly at Inslaw's liquidation sale --and use the valuable software to win a bigger prize: theProject Eagle contract to deliver at least 12,000 newcomputer workstations, complete with software, to some 200Justice Department sites nationwide.   &quot;This is corruption, and it deserves to be prosecuted,&quot;contends Mr. Hamilton, who, with his wife, has resuscitatedInslaw, which now sells updated versions of Promis to privateand municipal customers.   The Hamiltons' conspiracy theory is receivingpoint-by-point attention from the House Judiciary Committeeinvestigators, in part because of Rep. Brooks's belief thatgovernment agencies periodically punish contractors who crossthem. The committee staff also is considering questions theHamiltons have raised about Project Eagle.   Among these are why, after the protracted battle overacquiring the Promis software, Project Eagle doesn't includea uniform case-management program for all of the JusticeDepartment's branches. &quot;It just doesn't make any sense atall,&quot; says Mr. Miller, the private computer consultant.Lawyers in the department's Washington headquarters can't tapinto a common data base to tell if someone in a regionalfield office is working on the same case, confirms TonySalvemini, a technology analyst with the General AccountingOffice, a congressional watchdog agency.   Taking a dark view, the Hamiltons allege that the missingcase-management system was supposed to be the pilferedPromis. Justice Department officials insist that the Eaglecontract, awarded last June to Tisoft Inc. of Fairfax, Va.,doesn't include a uniform case-management system for a moremundane, bureaucratic reason: Each of the department's majorcomponents wants to design its own.   Frustrated to find his own small company undercongressional scrutiny and associated with the Inslawcontroversy, Tisoft's owner and chief executive officer,Patrick Gallagher, says he doesn't know anything about theHamiltons' charges or about their software. He adds, &quot;I feellike we're caught up in a storm that has a life of its own.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
