For those of you unversed in computerese, here aredefinitions of some commonly used words.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Applications software: This allows the computer to dospecific tasks, such as spreadsheets, word processing, ordrawing graphics. Applications software cannot work withoutan operating system.                                                                                                          Artificial Intelligence: The art that allows computers tomimic ordinary human intelligence and behavior.                                                                                                          Baud Rate: A measure of the speed at which computers senddata from one device to another, typically 300, 1,200 or2,400, with the higher numbers representing fastertransmissions. One baud is one bit of data per second.                                                                                                          Bit: Short for binary digit, the smallest unit of computerdata. A bit can have only two states, on or off, which arecommonly called one and zero. Digital computers -- not analogcomputers -- can deal only with data coded in this on/offfashion.                                                                                                          Byte: Eight bits are in a byte, which is the amount ofmemory needed to store a single number or letter. It's thecommon unit of computer storage.                                                                                                          CD-ROM: Compact disk read-only-media. A laser disk similarto a music CD, except that it holds billions of bytes ofinformation, such as encyclopedias and catalogs. Informationcannot be written onto the disks, nor can the disks bealtered.                                                                                                          CAD: Computer-aided design. Allows engineers andarchitects to design parts, products and building plans on avideo screen rather than on paper.                                                                                                          Chips or Microchips: Tiny electronic circuits etched insilicon, used in almost all electronic equipment. Theyprocess and store data.                                                                                                          CPU: Central processing unit. This is where the computer's&quot;brains&quot; reside. It's the chip that stores and processesinformation. In a PC, the CPU and the microprocessor are thesame.                                                                                                          Disks: A hard disk is often permanently installed insidethe hard-disk drive in the computer. It allows users toquickly store or retrieve data within their machines. Floppydisks come in two sizes: the older 5 1/4-inch disk and thenewer, more powerful 3 1/2-inch disk. Floppy disks allowusers to store and move data from one computer to another. Adisk drive is a storage device that allows users to loadprograms and data from a floppy disk to a computer's harddrive, and vice versa.                                                                                                          Gigaflop: A common measurement of a supercomputer's spead.One gigaflop is a billion operations or calculations persecond.                                                                                                          Hardware: The computer and any accessories, such as diskdrives, printers, monitors and keyboards. Everything exceptthe software.                                                                                                          Heat Seekers: Someone who feels he needs -- and who buys-- the most powerful and latest equipment.                                                                                                          Icons: Users manipulate data by moving stamp-sizedpictures, or icons, of files or folders on a screen, insteadof working with lists of files and names. Icons are used as away of commanding the computer, and can represent documents,applications programs and places to store data.                                                                                                          ISDN: Integrated services digital network. Aninternational telecommunications standard that allowstransmissions of voice, video and data simultaneously.                                                                                                          LAN: Local area network. Software that controls thetraffic on networks of personal computers, or networkoperating systems, within an office, building or locality. Itallows users to exchange and share data, and use the sameperipherals, such as printers or data bases.                                                                                                          Memory: The computer's working storage area, which isconstructed of RAM chips. (See RAM.) Memory determines thesize and number of programs and information that can bestored in a computer.                                                                                                          Menus: Pop-up lists that allow users to select differentfunctions of the computer. Menu-driven programs are easier touse than programs that require users to remember a string ofcommands.                                                                                                          Microcomputers: Another name for a personal computer. Thecomputer's CPU is contained in a single chip, ormicroprocessor. Minicomputers, mainframes and supercomputersare all successively more powerful, with each containing morepowerful chips.                                                                                                          Modem: A device for transmitting and receiving computerdata over telephone lines.                                                                                                          Mouse: A hand-held pointing device that allows users tomove a cursor around the screen, and select differentfunctions from menus. Frequently used in lieu of a keyboard.                                                                                                          Operating System (OS): Key software programs that controlor define the basic operations and functions of a personalcomputer -- for example, DOS or OS/2. Users need an operatingsystem before they can begin work on an applications program.                                                                                                          Propeller Head: A computer programmer, also known as bitbrains.                                                                                                          RAM: Random access memory. This is the computer's workarea, where programs and data are temporarily stored when inuse.                                                                                                          Surge Protector: A device that protects the delicatecircuitry of a computer from electrical power surges andspikes, which can damage or burn out a computer.
