(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The parsonage formerly occupied by PTLministry founder Jim Bakker and his family has been sold to a NewJersey businessman who bid $685,000 for the luxurious lakeside home.   PTL Attorney Edwin Allman conducted the auction between only twobidders at the World Outreach Center at Heritage USA on Tuesday.   PTL originally had agreed to sell the Bakker house to Robert M.Rubino for $625,000, Allman said in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on June29. However, Judge Rufus Reynolds told Allman to conduct an auctionafter a competing bid of $666,000 from an unnamed Houston man wasannounced in court.   ``He's a delightful businessman who will be moving to TegaCay,'' Allman said of Rubino. Tega Cay is a community beside LakeWylie and a few miles from PTL's Heritage USA complex.   Rubino owned several pizza restaurants and other real estate inand around New Jersey, Allman said.   The 10,266-square-foot house has four bedrooms, 5{ bathrooms, a36-foot long swimming pool, a whirlpool, a guardhouse, a playhouse,a boat dock, a marble entry foyer, an exercise room, a music roomand a kitchen crammed with appliances and cherry cabinetry.   The sale of the Bakker house ended more than three months ofeffort by PTL officials to sell the vacant property.   PTL tried to sell the Bakker's house and 10 other pieces ofproperty at an auction in Tega Cay on April 12.   At that time, then-PTL Trustee David Clark said he hoped toraise $1 million from the sale of the Bakker house alone to helpthe ministry reorganize. However, that auction failed to garnereven an opening bid as high as $500,000 for the house.   Allman said in bankruptcy court that a recent assessment of theproperty had determined the fair market value of the Bakkers' houseto be $650,000.   ``We were satisfied with the price paid for the house,'' Allmansaid.   The Bakkers did not file an objection to the sale of theirformer residence and were not present for the auction.   Tammy Bakker, however, cried for several minutes at the June 29bankruptcy hearing as the sale of the house was discussed.   ``It's a house I loved because we raised our children in it,'she said after the hearing.''   The Bakkers again are living along Lake Wylie, this time in ahouse rented for them by supporters in their bid to regain theministry Bakker founded then lost last year in a sex-and-moneyscandal.   Bakker stepped down in March 1987 as it was revealed he had sexin 1980 with a church secretary, Jessica Hahn, and paid a reported$363,700 in hush money to silence her.   Donations to the ministry then fell amid revelations of a lavishlifestyle led by the Bakkers and other PTL officials and theministry now is in bankruptcy court seeking to reorganize, sell offassets and repay about $130 million in debt.</TEXT></DOC>
