What happens on Sundayat Candlestick Park when the 49ers play the New York Giants will be obscuredby the grave reality of war. And years from now, when most of us will be ableto recall the daily events of the first week of the war, few of us are likelyto remember much about this football game.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PAT SUMMERALL KNOWS ABOUT LIFE AND DEATHALCOHOL ALMOST KILLED TV COMMENTATOR  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  NFL ChampionshipsCommentary  </MEMO><TEXT>     For others -- players, coaches and their families -- the NFC championshipgame is every bit as important today as it was a week or a month ago.;    ForPat Summerall, it is more important than he ever imagined it could be. Not solong ago, his chances of being here were close to zero.;    Summerall, thegrand, mellow voice of reserve and understanding that has combined with JohnMadden on CBS to provide the most popular NFL broadcasting crew on TV, nearlydied last month after working a Chicago Bears-Washington Redskins game.;    &quot;Iwas talking with (49ers Coach) George Seifert today about the release we haveafforded to us by football,&quot; Summerall said Friday night at the NFCchampionship game news conference. &quot;It might not be that way for the averagecitizen, but for those of us who work in this atmosphere, it is a great reliefto be able to jump into the planning of a game like this and get away from therest of the news for a while.;    &quot;Obviously,&quot; he said, &quot;it's a relief for mejust to be here.&quot;;    Summerall, 60, has a drinking problem. He was like a lotof us who at one time or another thought we could drink all night and work allday without any repercussions. Like most of us, he learned differently.;   The night before the Redskins-Bears game Dec. 9, Summerall took twodoctor-prescribed pain killers in the morning and two more around noon, bothof them on an empty stomach. He said he had three drinks that afternoon beforea production meeting, four more pain killers later on and drinks through theevening.;    On a flight from Atlanta to Jacksonville, Fla., after the game,Summerall became nauseous, which is not uncommon to heavy drinkers. But thiswas different.;    &quot;I was throwing up like never before,&quot; he said. &quot;I've beenhung over before enough times that I know what it's like to vomit, but thiswasn't the usual stuff, it didn't look the same; I kept throwing up every fewminutes and at the end I realized it was blood, just pure blood.&quot;;    He wasadmitted to a hospital Dec. 11 with a bleeding ulcer and woke up two dayslater on the critical list, where he remained for a total of five days.;    &quot;Ifound out later, after the first two days, that about 15 more minutes and Iwould have been dead,&quot; Summerall said. &quot;I immediately thought about that planeflight from Atlanta to Jacksonville; it's about 45 minutes. I could have justas easily been on a flight from say, here in San Francisco to Jacksonville, inwhich case I would have arrived home dead.&quot;;    Anybody care to drink to that?This is a guy who never missed work from being hung over and as recently asFriday said, &quot;I never even felt bad on game days. I had a strong constitutionor something, I guess.&quot;;    Strong, but not as strong as he led himself tobelieve.;    &quot;I remember a little bit from going into the hospital,&quot; he said.&quot;I think I was in shock, but I remember a doctor standing over me saying,'We've got to operate on this guy right now,' and I remember the other doctorsaying, 'How? This guy doesn't have blood left in him.';    &quot;I don't know ifit made me more religious, but it made me appreciate life a lot more than Iever have before. You know how people have those near-death experiences andthey say they saw their lives flashing before their eyes? Something sort oflike that happened.;    &quot;I used to do it up pretty good with (former CBSbroadcasting partner Tom) Brookshier and I swear, I had dreams or visions orsomething in the hospital; I saw blurs, images of nights with Brookshier, justrushing by.;    &quot;I talked to Tom after I started getting better, and I toldhim about that. He asked me how long I was out. I told him it was two fulldays. He said, 'That's not enough time to remember all the nights we wasteddrinking whiskey.' &quot;;    He is now confident that he has learned his lesson.;   &quot;I haven't once thought about having a drink,&quot; he said. &quot;When the doctortold me one more drink would be the same as giving me less than a year tolive, that was all I needed to hear. Sure, the pills that day complicatedthings, and I should have had more sleep, but whiskey, that's what did me in.I'm through with it; I've had enough.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BART WRIGHT, Tacoma Morning News Tribune  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910120  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  19C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  883  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday January 20, 199100020220,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
