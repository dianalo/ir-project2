The measure, part of a $9.8 billion State Departmentauthorization Bush signed Friday night, effectively repeals part ofa 1952 law that barred visitors with radical views.   Nobel laureates Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Pablo Neruda havebeen excluded under the law in recent years as well as authorsGraham Greene, Doris Lessing and Carlos Fuentes, according to aSenate Foreign Relations Committee report.   Among others excluded were French actor Yves Montand; formerRhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith; Hortensia Allende, widow of theMarxist president of Chile, and Yasir Arafat, head of the PalestineLiberation Organization.   ``For a generation and more, these miserable provisions made theUnited States present itself to other nations as a nation offearful, muddled, intimidated citizens,'' said Sen. DanielMoynihan, D-N.Y.   ``The so-called look-out list of excludable aliens maintained bythe State Deparment should be purged of the names of personspreviously considered ineligible because of political beliefs orassociations,'' Moynihan declared.   Still subject to exclusion under the new measure are ``alienswho are polygamists or who practise polygamy or advocate thepractice of polygamy.''   Polygamy itself, but not advocacy of polygamy, is forbidden bystate law in most of the country.   Lawyers familiar with immigration could not recall any problemswith polygamists visiting the United States, who include manyleaders of Moslem countries.   The Senate committee report said the new provisions would notprevent the government from barring visitors on grounds of nationalsecurity or foreign policy.   Others still barred under the law _ but not always in practice _are the mentally retarded, the insane, criminals, pimps,prostitutes, paupers, vagrants, professional beggars, stowaways,drug addicts, chronic alcoholics and those with a dangerouscontagious disease or likely to become burdens on the Americanpublic.   There is also a ban on, but no definition of, those ``afflictedwith psychopathic personality, or sexual deviation, or a mentaldefect.''   Another undefined but excluded group is: ``Aliens coming to theUnited States to engage in any immoral sexual act.''</TEXT></DOC>
