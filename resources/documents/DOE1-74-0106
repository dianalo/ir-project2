<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-74-0106 </DOCNO><TEXT>The systems CH/sub 3/COOH-CCl/sub 4/ and CH/sub 3/COOH-C/sub 6/D/sub 12/were studied by measuring the magnetic relaxation times T/sub 1/ of thevarious protons in these mixtures. From these data, intermolecular relaxationrates arising from interactions among the protons of OH- and CH/sub 3/-groupswere determined. By means of the association parameter A associationbetween various groups of acetic acid in mixtures with CCL/sub 4/ andC/sub 6/D/sub 12/ has been investigated. Closest distances of approachbetween various protons of acetic acid and configurations of maximumprobability are reported for the pure liquid and the mixtures. For pureacetic acid a comparison with X-ray and neutron scattering results isgiven. (orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
