In New York, Toronto and Los Angeles, uniformed security guardschecked the purses and bags of movie patrons.   Guards were stationed at each side of the screen at the ZiegfeldTheater in New York, where about 100 protesters demonstrated,including a man who denounced moviegoers as ``reprobates'' and``homosexuals.''   ``I believe that as Judas sold him (Jesus) out the first time,that Hollywood is selling him out the second time,'' saiddemonstrator Carol Sergio of Queens.   Rabbi Yosef Friedman, an Orthodox Jew, carried a sign reading,``Rabbis Protest Mockery of Any Religion.''   ``We see it as an attack on morality and traditional familyvalues,'' Friedman said of the film. We feel these people who aremocking Christianity today would also be willing to mock Judaism.''   However, movie patrons vastly outnumbered the protesters in allareas, standing in lines by the hundreds and buying out the firstscreenings of the film based on the 1955 novel by Greek authorNikos Kazantzakis. Directed by Martin Scorsese, it stars WillemDafoe as Jesus, Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene and Harvey Keitelas Judas.   Some Christians have branded it blasphemous for its portrayal ofa doubting Jesus, who, in a dream sequence, has sex with MaryMagdalene.   In Washington, D.C., about 30 people waved placards and marchedbehind a mannequin dressed as Jesus outside a theater where theearly afternoon show was a sellout, officials said.   One protester, Rita Warren of Falls Church, Va., said she hopedpeople would be discouraged from seeing the film but did not thinkit should be banned.   ``They have a right to see it as much as we have a right to behere protesting against it,'' she said.   Although a demonstration by 25,000 people at Universal Studioswas peaceful on Thursday, 75 Los Angeles police officers monitoredthe movie house where ``Last Temptation'' opened Friday.   Vandals tossed paint at the Century Plaza Theater about 5 a.m.,splattering the building and a glass-enclosed movie poster withyellow paint, said Fabian Munez, head of the firm that providessecurity for the ABC Entertainment Center, where the theater islocated.   Police Cmdr. William Booth said no officers would be inside thetheater in Century City despite fears of slashed or spray-paintedscreens.   By noon someone had spread glue on the floor in the women's restroom, said theater patron Jo Drott, 24.   The 200 protesters included children with ``I Love Jesus''T-shirts who sang ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and motherswho pushed strollers with such taped-on signs as ``Don't CrucifyJesus Again.''   One huge poster aimed at Universal's parent company, MCA Inc.,said: ``The Last Temptation of Christ will do for MCA What PearlHarbor Did for Japan: They Started a War and Lost it.''   Catherine Romero, 19, of Whittier taped a sign to her chest thatsaid ``I Love Jesus but that doesn't stop me from having an openmind.'' She said she was raised a Catholic and her mother, a churchchoir director, encouraged her to see the film.   ``This morning my mother said `Go ahead, be careful, keep anopen mind and make up your own mind,''' she said.   Hundreds of people waited in line for the first showing of themovie in San Francisco, which sold out. But only about a dozenprotesters were outside the NorthPoint Theater at Fisherman's Wharf.   ``I wanted to see the first show so that I could tell all myChristian friends that they can come see it without believing thepropaganda that they are receiving in the mail,'' said ChuckHilbert of San Francisco.   About 50 demonstrators gathered outside a theater in Chicago,where the Rev. Nikitas Lulias, chancellor of the 200,000-memberGreek Orthodox diocese said, ``We have called upon our people to gowith prayer in their hearts _ that God might anoint theseindividuals to stop showing the film.''   In Toronto, an actor challenged the protesters by waving $20bills and offering to buy them tickets to see the film. The onlytakers, however, were four ordinary filmgoers.</TEXT></DOC>
