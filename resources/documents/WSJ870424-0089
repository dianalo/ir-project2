Shortly thereafter, the dollar revives.    That's what President Carter did in the late 1970s, issuing bonds denominated in Swiss francs and West German marks. Now, with the dollar skidding against the Japanese yen, President Reagan is being urged to authorize an issue of yen-denominated bonds.    Could such &quot;Reagan bonds&quot; be in the cards?    The Treasury isn't encouraging such speculation. It says the idea is getting no more than routine consideration. But support for it comes from a variety of sources, including former U.S. monetary officials and the Japanese government. Talk of yen bonds is rife in the currency market as well.    The Japanese are most enthusiastic about the notion of yen-denominated U.S. government bonds. The dollar's steep drop against the yen, totaling 46% since February 1985, has cut into Japan's export revenue and manufacturing base and created large foreign exchange losses for the many Japanese buyers of U.S. securities.    The dollar fell against the Japanese currency in yesterday's trading and was quoted at 140.78 yen late in the day in New York.    &quot;It would be useful for the U.S. government to take these measures at this time,&quot; a high-level Japanese diplomat in Washington says. Japan's Finance Ministry, he says, &quot;would not only support the idea but would be ready to cooperate with the U.S. government on this.&quot;    One result of a sale would be a &quot;war chest&quot; of foreign currency at the Treasury's disposal. This could be used for defending the dollar through foreign exchange market intervention -- in much the same way that the Carter administration was free to use its newly acquired marks and Swiss francs to help the dollar rebound.    Of course, the Reagan administration is largely responsible for the dollar's current decline, which it encouraged to try to shrink the country's huge trade deficit. With a significant improvement in the trade balance still elusive, the White House might not be willing to do much to reverse the dollar's slide. A weaker currency tends to make imports more expensive for Americans and U.S. products less costly abroad.    In an article in the Japan Economic Journal this month, Yo Kurosawa, deputy president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, writes that it is &quot;high time&quot; for the U.S. to issue yen bonds to &quot;assure the world's trust in the dollar.&quot;    Mr. Kurosawa says the Treasury should issue the bonds &quot;on a grand scale&quot; equaling about 10% of the annual net increase in U.S. medium-term and long-term bond issues. That would mean about $17 billion, based on a fiscal 1987 budget deficit of $172.2 billion. The bonds could be sold in the Japanese domestic and Euroyen markets, he says, and their issuance should continue until the annual U.S. budget deficit narrows to $50 billion.    Even yen-bond enthusiasts agree that this scenario is too extreme to be implemented. But by talking in multibillion-dollar amounts, Mr. Kurosawa may be trying to expand notions of how large an issue might be feasible.    Yen-denominated bonds could carry a sizable risk to the U.S.: If the dollar continues to slump against the Japanese currency, the Treasury's obligations to pay interest and principal in yen would become ever costlier.    But that risk may be exactly the impetus needed for the U.S. to help stabilize the dollar, Robert V. Roosa, a partner at Brown Brothers Harriman andamp; Co., a New York private bank, says. Mr. Roosa is a former undersecretary of the Treasury for monetary affairs who played a role in issuing non-dollar U.S. bonds in the 1960s.    &quot;I feel the time is clearly here now&quot; for yen-denominated bonds, Mr. Roosa says. &quot;In this way the U.S. (would) also imply its own self-confidence that indeed the dollar will come back.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
