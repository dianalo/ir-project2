But in Frankfurt, a surge in the dollar was enough to override those worries and shares rose.    In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average fell 311.22 points to 24172.60. Turnover narrowed to 530 million shares from 550 million shares Monday. Losers heavily outnumbered gainers, 686 to 217.    Traders said share prices continued a rout that began Monday on currency and other worries stirred by increasing tensions in the Middle East. Brokers said investors were unnerved by the uncertainty in the foreign exchange outlook, concerns about a protracted slump in the Japanese government bond market and fears of higher inflation and interest rates.    These concerns were aggravated by Iranian statements regarding the U.S. escort of Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. Iran has pledged to seek revenge against the U.S. and Saudi Arabia for the deaths of more than 400 people, mostly Iranians, in violent clashes Friday in Mecca.    In addition, trading in NEC, a major electronics concern, was suspended several times after a report in the afternoon edition of Mainichi Shimbun saying the company is being investigated by the Japanese government for illegal shipments of high-technology goods to the Soviet bloc. NEC strongly denied the report.    The report also claimed a second company, which it speculated could be Sumitomo Heavy Industries or Mitsubishi Heavy Industries or &quot;another heavy industry company&quot; is also being investigated. Both those companies also denied the allegations.    NEC plunged 200 yen to 1,840 yen ($12.20). Shares of other companies in the industry also fell and contributed to the overall market decline, but the drops weren't anywhere near as large as NEC's. Sumitomo fell eight yen to 319 yen and Mitsubishi declined 22 yen to 550 yen.    Meanwhile, the Tokyo Stock Exchange formally approved an application by British Petroleum to list its shares on the exchange. The stock is scheduled to begin trading later this month. BP will be the 61st foreign concern to be listed on the exchange's foreign section.    In London, share prices closed broadly lower for the fourth consecutive session. The 100-share index fell 26.5 points to 2307.8, and the Financial Times 30-share index was down 26.5 points to 1788.6. Volume rose slightly to 696.4 million shares from 660.6 million shares Monday but was still light.    Dealers said the market continued to be weighed down by concerns that interest rates may be headed higher and by heightened tension in the Middle East.    The interest rate concerns especially hit store shares. But oil issues again bucked the trend and closed higher on the back of firm crude prices, dealers said.    Lack of interest during the summer holiday months also took its toll as marketmakers knocked prices progressively lower to attract buyers.    But the market did recover from its lows after the government announced that Britain's official reserves data showed an underlying rise of $499 million in July from June. Analysts were expecting a fall of about $225 million.    Among oil shares, Shell Transport andamp; Trading was up 12 pence at #15.16 ($24), and British Petroleum rose five pence to 404 pence. But Britoil ended unchanged at 357 pence after trading higher much of the day.    Blue Arrow said it was offering $75 a share, or $1.2 billion, to acquire Manpower, a U.S. temporary employment agency. Blue Arrow said it would finance the bid with a rights issue to raise #837 million ($1.33 billion), the biggest ever by a British company.    Blue Arrow plunged 163 pence to 918 pence on the news. Dealers said the rights issue helped depress the overall market in early trading.    Gold issues fell despite higher bullion prices.    Frankfurt share prices were mostly higher in calm trading, boosted by the surge of the dollar late Monday in New York.    The rise in the dollar to a six-month high, which was triggered by fears of escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf and firmer oil prices, helped the market overcome the negative impact of the gulf crisis on most of the world's stock markets, brokers said.    Most price gains were rather small and turnover was sluggish. &quot;There is too little buying interest to make this a real rally,&quot; one Frankfurt broker said.    Shares of auto makers, which benefit from the higher dollar, and companies with large oil inventories were the market leaders. Bayerische Motoren Werke climbed seven marks to 754 marks ($402.82) amid speculation certain investors are accumulating stocks in the auto group. Volkswagen rose six marks to 397 marks, and Daimler-Benz edged up three marks to 1,158 marks.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
