A lucky few get to chase dreams of glory.    Every other August, the top Christmas trees in the U.S. gather for a sort of beauty pageant, sponsored by the 2,800-member National Christmas Tree Association. It's something like the Miss America contest, except there's no talent competition and the contestants are judged &quot;au naturel.&quot;    &quot;If you ask me,&quot; says the grower of this year's second-place tree, Robert Chengerian of Lysander, N.Y., &quot;all that tinsel junk just cheapens the beauty.&quot;    This year's pageant, held in Minneapolis, brought together 34 cut trees that had qualified by winning their state competitions. Judges, who are growers and members of the association, measure these Scotch pines, blue spruces and other species against demanding standards. Trunks must be straight. Droopy branches are a no-no, as is fungus. The tree can't be too fat or too skinny. And there can be only one top branch -- for the star, of course.    The winner was a voluptuous eight-foot-tall Fraser fir grown by Ronald and Dorothy Palmer of Mossyrock, Wash. They spent hundreds of dollars, not to mention hours of care, grooming their entry.    Christmas tree growers, like Miss America hopefuls, have their tricks. Mr. Palmer, for example, put splints on his tree's branches to make sure they grew straight. And once the pageant is over, the backbiting starts. &quot;We were even accused of painting our tree or putting some color on it,&quot; Mrs. Palmer says.    On top of their growing expenses, the Palmers paid their own air fare to Minneapolis, plus $275 in cargo fare for their tree. Winning got them a blue ribbon -- and the right to select a tree for the Blue Room of the White House. That turned into an additional expense: To get a tree big enough, they had to buy one from a neighbor in Mossyrock. And while they found an airline that carried the tree for free, they paid their own way to the ceremony.    With rewards like these, why do growers bother with the pageant? For one thing, the national title is very prestigious within the Christmas tree industry. And some people need to enter. Mr. Chengerian, who still has his second-place tree on display at his farm in a bucket of water, says, &quot;I used to coach, and if I put a team out there I expected it to be competitive. I do the same with my trees.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
