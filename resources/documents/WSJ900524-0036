Of the $1.24 billion invested, more than 25%, or $320million, went to telecommunications products and servicescompanies. That's an increase of 55%, said TechnologicPartners, a Manhattan-based research firm. It found that1988's No. 1 target for investment, computer software andservices, fell 23% to $208 million.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;In the last five years some of the most successful newcompanies have been telecommunications companies,&quot; saidRichard A. Shaffer, principal at Technologic. Meanwhile, hesaid, the computer business has become a hodgepodge oftechnologies and players that confounds investors.   &quot;Seed,&quot; or early stage financing, a growing segment in thepast five years, was another loser in 1989, falling 10% to$62 million, or 33 seed financings, compared with $69million, or 41 seeds, in 1988.   While later-stage, or &quot;mezzanine,&quot; financings alsodeclined, middle-stage investments garnered greater supportfrom investors who held back until companies were well underway. Mr. Shaffer said this should continue as long as themarket for initial public offerings remains slow.   Other top targets for investment, according toTechnologic, included computer peripheral companies,third-ranked at $140 million; integrated circuitmanufacturers ($133 million); and computer systems suppliers($130 million).</TEXT></DOC>
