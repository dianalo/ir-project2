Reductionand reoxidation of the Ni- or Co-promoted heptamolybdate have also beeninvestigated. It is shown that upon these treatments the supported speciesremain stable and have a similar behavior. The changes in the spectraobserved can therefore be attributed to chemical effects rather thanto structural modifications. A global interpretation of the Raman bandsof supported molybdenum oxide and reduced species is discussed. In particular,the terminal Mo-O band wavenumber shifts have been discussed in termsof three different effects, namely, ligand heterogeneity, coordinativeheterogeneity, and oxidation number of Mo ions.</TEXT></DOC>
