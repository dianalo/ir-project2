Texaco Inc. remains as difficult to settle as on the day in November 1985 that the history-making verdict was handed up.    But it has not been for lack of effort.    Working in the strictest secrecy, the companies' investment bankers spent weeks earlier this year pondering imaginative, out-of-court solutions in the offices of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., which represents Texaco. The intermediaries even structured a &quot;fudge factor&quot; so each side could put a different value on the settlement.    By late June, they had narrowed their differences in the $10.3 billion case to hundreds of millions of dollars. Under the various proposals, the settlement would have cost White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco between roughly $1.7 billion and $2.4 billion, one insider says. The value to Houston-based Pennzoil was between roughly $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion, the source adds. Part of a draft agreement with the numbers left blank was even drawn up, according to people on both sides.    Then, suddenly, the entire character of the case changed -- as it had so many times before. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced it would support Texaco in a narrow but hotly contested aspect of the case. Texaco, regaining momentum, was happy to continue negotiating -- though in a much lower range of numbers. There was no point in going on.    In August, yet another settlement overture was made. William Weitzel, Texaco's general counsel, telephoned William Barnett, managing partner at Pennzoil's Houston law firm of Baker andamp; Botts. But the call failed to rekindle talks. In just the past six weeks, four intermediaries have importuned Pennzoil's top officials to resume negotiations, Pennzoil officials said yesterday after a meeting with analysts in New York. But the officials insisted that they will go back to the bargaining table only after hearing from Texaco principals.    Soon -- perhaps as early as tomorrow -- the warring litigants may indeed have another reason to resuscitate the dormant talks. The Texas Supreme Court, which hands down such orders on Wednesdays, may rule at any time whether to hear Texaco's appeal of the judgment. Pennzoil won the judgment two years ago after convincing a state court jury in Houston that it had a contract to buy 42% of Getty Oil Co., and that Texaco had unlawfully interfered with that contract when it agreed to acquire all of Getty.    Pennzoil strategists have privately conceded that the Texas High Court will have trouble turning its back on an appeal of history's biggest legal judgment. At their presentation to New York analysts yesterday, company officials asserted that a decision to accept the appeal would be &quot;insignificant&quot; because the court is certain to affirm the judgment. Texaco, in turn, yesterday issued a statement claiming that &quot;Pennzoil is desperately afraid&quot; the court will agree to hear the case.    In any case, says one litigation insider, the court's decision to hear or reject the case will represent &quot;an event of significance&quot; that could jog the parties back to the bargaining table.    But if so, several special factors will make a settlement as difficult as ever to obtain. The gulf between the companies' settlement goals has widened to billions of dollars. Texaco management, currently holding the upper hand, won't budge over $1 billion, and the company's board might refuse to approve even that amount, a Texaco source says. Pennzoil has publicly hardened its settlement demand at $4.1 billion, though J. Hugh Liedtke, Pennzoil chairman, said in an interview yesterday that that figure was &quot;not set in cement.&quot;    A second obstacle is the growing complexity of the litigation. While the fight drags on in the state courts of Texas, new hostilities are erupting in a U.S. bankruptcy court in White Plains, N.Y., where Texaco in April sought refuge from Pennzoil's judgment. Each new court decision in one aspect of the case invariably affects the standings in the other venue, continually tipping the balance of power.    &quot;When these guys lose (a round), they won't talk settlement because they have no leverage,&quot; says one high-level participant in the case. &quot;When they win, they won't settle because they have all the chips.&quot; The participant refuses to be identified by which side he represents -- but his remarks could apply equally to either party.    A final obstacle, which may loom largest, is emotion. &quot;Both sides are allowing emotion to cloud their judgment,&quot; admits another person close to the private dealings between the parties. &quot;The question is, who is doing it more?&quot;    Texaco, and its legion of supporters on Wall Street and elsewhere, accuse Pennzoil of being stubbornly determined to &quot;extort&quot; an excessive settlement from what they consider to be a patently improper judgment. Salem Research Associates Inc., a bankruptcy-case research concern, accuses Pennzoil of pursuing &quot;abuse of process&quot; in its &quot;wanton and malicious quest for vengeance,&quot; all in the face of recent positive developments for Texaco.    On the other side is Gary E. Hindes, chairman of Delaware Bay Co., a New York investment banking concern, who insists that Texaco intends to stonewall in the settlement talks in hopes of obtaining an outright reversal of the judgment. The Texas courts have found that the company acted maliciously and wantonly in breaking up Pennzoil's pact with Getty, and only by litigating to the death, Mr. Hindes argues, can Texaco's directors avoid &quot;devastating personal liability&quot; in some 18 shareholder lawsuits that have been filed against them after the judgment.    At the least, Texaco has been very successful in buying time in the case. Texaco's Chapter 11 filing for protection from creditors took away one of Pennzoil's biggest settlement clubs: the threat that it would &quot;secure&quot; its judgment with liens against Texaco property or other legal actions provided for under Texas law.    Immediately after the April 12 bankruptcy-law filing, James Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief executive officer, and Alfred DeCrane, chairman, met at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan with Mr. Liedtke, Pennzoil's chairman. The Texaco executives assured him that after announcing the filing to the media, they would return to the Waldorf to engage in settlement talks. But the stunned Mr. Liedtke said he needed time to assess his position. If negotiations were to resume, he said, he would put a representative in touch with Texaco.    That representative was Lewis Glucksman, former head of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb and a longtime acquaintance of Mr. Liedtke. After meeting with Messrs. Kinnear and DeCrane at Texaco, he began a series of meetings with a Morgan Stanley senior partner, Donald Brennan, who appears in the case for Texaco whenever settlement overtures occur.    The talks weren't easy. When progress occurred, one insider says, an &quot;offsetting external event&quot; always seemed to distract negotiators, such as when Robert Holmes a Court of Australia announced the purchase of a 9.6% Texaco stake.    But despite the outside interference, the structure of the talks made them among the most positive yet held in the case. The use of third parties gave each side deniability; though authorized to negotiate, the investment bankers were assuredly not authorized to settle. Only the principals could do that, and their absence from the bargaining table would enable either side to disavow anything that occurred in the talks, should that prove necessary.    &quot;Lew really thought he was getting somewhere,&quot; Mr. Liedtke said yesterday of his representative, Mr. Glucksman. Mr. Liedtke refused, however, to comment on anything that transpired in the meetings.    Then the talks were thrown out of whack altogether. In June the SEC announced it would file a &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief urging the Texas High Court to hear Texaco's appeal.    The issue in question had nothing to do with whether Getty and Pennzoil intended to be bound to a contract, or whether Texaco had interfered with that contract, as the jury had found. Rather, the SEC said that Pennzoil -- by arranging to purchase certain Getty Oil shares privately while it also had a tender offer outstanding -- had violated SEC Rule 10b-13, which proscribes such activities. Texaco, taking the argument one step further, believed that such a violation made Pennzoil's contract void. And nobody, Texaco believed, can interfere with a void contract.    Suddenly, one of the many technical issues in Texaco's defense held the potential of becoming its strongest argument. Certainly, Texaco faces several hurdles in getting the courts to buy the 10b-13 argument. But it was clear to the negotiators that the playing field had changed again.    A decision by the Texas justices to hear the appeal would extend Texaco's current advantage -- though that advantage remains fragile. The court could still leave the judgment intact; it takes only three justices to accept a case, but a majority of the nine justices are required to &quot;reform&quot; any judgment. The court could refuse to hear the appeal altogether, leaving Texaco with only one last shot -- the U.S. Supreme Court -- to obtain an outright reversal.    ---         Pennzoil v.
