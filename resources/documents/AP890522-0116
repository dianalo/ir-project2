Students organized demonstrations on at least 23 campusesnationwide. Most were peaceful and small in scale, with just a fewhundred students taking part, police reports said.

Students demanded that 43,000 U.S. troops stationed here under amutual defense treaty be withdrawn immediately. They burnedAmerican flags and put up posters denouncing the United States.   In Seoul, police arrested 18 students armed with iron bars andfirebombs who briefly occupied an office at National PoliceHeadquarters, officials said. Students smashed windows and threwanti-government and anti-American leaflets outside, they said.   ``Disband the torture and murder machine,'' students chantedbefore being overpowered by police.   Security was stepped up at U.S. diplomatic and militaryfacilities, with riot police standing guard. Nine busloads of riotpolice guarded the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.   Student groups called for a week of protests to demand an end toSouth Korea's military alliance with the United States. Themilitants claim the United States helps prop up authoritarian rulein South Korea.   Dissidents and radical students are calling for the overthrow ofPresident Roh Tae-woo's government.
