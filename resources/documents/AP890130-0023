WILLIAMS</BYLINE><UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK><DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NATO troops and arms are increasinglyunpopular among West Germans, so it was no surprise when Bonnofficials carefully ducked the issue of modernizing short-rangenuclear missiles at a NATO defense strategy session.   Government sources said privately that Chancellor Helmut Kohl hadinstructed senior West German officials attending the annualconference to stay mum on whether Bonn supports extending the rangeof battlefield nuclear missiles.   Most of the defense experts taking part in the weekend conferencestrongly support the 1983 plan adopted by the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization to improve the missiles, chief among them the Lance,which was first introduced in 1972 and has a range of just over 60miles.   They also appeared to support U.S. calls for a cautious responseto Kremlin disarmament initiatives, though the conference did notproduce a statement.   The issue is extremely sensitive for the Bonn government, whichis unlikely to shirk its commitments within the 16-nation allianceby openly opposing modernization despite strong public opposition.   But by remaining silent on the issue, the Bonn leadership may beencouraging unrealistic hopes among West German voters that themodernization question is still open. It was left to left-wing WestGerman politicians to speak out on the issue at the conference, andthey voiced resistance.   Members of the opposition Social Democratic Party told the groupof 171 NATO defense experts that West Germans oppose modernizationand have serious problems with the size of the NATO force posted intheir country.   As Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gains in popularityamong West Germans _ 71 percent give him a favorable rating _ publicsupport for defense spending and the NATO troop presence has waned.   Most conference delegates attacked what they saw as a dangerouscomplacency that could weaken defenses.   U.S. Defense Secretary-designate John Tower told the conferencethat NATOshould maintain a ``healthy skepticism'' about Kremlindisarmament overtures and keep the West's nuclear options open.   The Texas Republican said the alliance runs the risk ofmortgaging its security if it fails to modernize its nuclear forcesbecause of perceived improvements in relations with Moscow.   Tower said the Soviet Union remains a powerful adversary withsuperior military capability and the West must not lose sight ofthat imbalance in its euphoria over disarmament prospects.   ``If we fail to consider that capability, or if we fail toconsider its relevance in terms of their intentions, then we do soat our peril,'' he said.   Social Democrats like Egon Bahr, the party's arms control expert,and Karsten Voigt drew fire from American participants when theyexplained many West Germans are increasingly critical of NATOdoctrine.   Even Defense Minister Rupert Scholz mentioned his country'sconcerns about the possibility of having to share a greater burdenof the NATO budget, though he avoided mentioning modernization.   Tower met privately with Scholz on Sunday morning but apparentlyaccomplished little in the way of persuading his allied counterpartto show stronger support for NATO policy.   ``We just illuminated some problems. We didn't come to anysolutions,'' Tower told The Associated Press after the meeting.   He declined to say what particular issues were covered or whetherhe was able to get an assurance from the West German minister thatBonn would support modernization.   The West Germans also were taken to task for their response toU.S. intelligence reports alleging that West German companies helpedLibya develop a chemical weapons potential.   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., accused Bonn of ``benign neglect'' inthe Libyan scandal and suggested senior West German officials havebeen lying to cover up their culpability.   On Sunday, the conference focused on the new and mounting threatsto alliance unity posed by Gorbachev's ``charm offensive'' in theWest.   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner raised the concern voicedby many other influential defense strategists that Gorbachev couldfail and be replaced by a far more conservative leader.   ``We cannot entrust our security to one person alone or tointentions,'' Woerner said. ``Both can change overnight.''   Britain's defense secretary, George Younger, warned that the Westwas ``being offered disarmament by the leader of the nation that hasbeen arming and rearming for years.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Carol Williams has been covering East-West affairsin Europe since 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
