GERANIOS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As rescue workers dug for earthquakevictims amid the crushed bodies and smell of death on the collapsedNimitz freeway, the minds of some were not in Oakland but in thesteaming jungles of Southeast Asia.   A stress expert said Vietnam veterans among the rescue workersbegan suffering emotional flashbacks as they pulled body after bodyfrom the rubble of the freeway that collapsed during the Oct. 17quake, killing at least 39 people.   ``More than half the construction workers were Vietnam vets,''said Tom Williams, a psychologist and Vietnam veteran himself whowent to the freeway to counsel workers. ``They started talkingabout Vietnam again.''   While the most obvious stress victims are those who lost a lovedone and workers dealing with violent death, experts say everyonewho lived through the temblor is at risk of emotional upheaval.   ``There are 6 million people affected emotionally by the quakein this area,'' Williams said. ``San Francisco looks normal, but ifyou stop anybody and ask them where they were during theearthquake, you will listen to a litany of stress.''   Social workers and mental health experts warn that increases inphysical abuse, depression and possibly suicide will follow the7.1-magnitude quake, which killed at least 64 people.   The toll is already mounting: Santa Cruz County officialsreported 37 new complaints of physical and sexual abuse after thequake, double the normal rate. Three women, an unusually highnumber, were reported raped in Santa Cruz the week after the quake.In hard-hit Watsonville, at least two women have been publiclybeaten by their husbands in the tent cities. The number of batteredwomen seeking shelter at San Francisco's Rosalie House is up 20percent since the quake. Calls to the Southern Alameda CountyDomestic Violence Law Project in Hayward have tripled.   Throughout the region there are reports of people afraid toreturn to their homes.   Suicide Prevention Inc. of San Francisco reported twice as manycalls as usual in the past week, with 90 percent related to thequake.   Mental health experts say the best therapy is for everyone inthe area to talk openly about the earthquake.   The apparent rise in domestic violence may stem from feelings ofhopelessness that a natural disaster can generate, said Dr. EttaBryant of the California Psychiatric Society in San Francisco.   Post-traumatic stress disorders, usually associated with warexperiences and often taking months to appear, are also expected toincrease, she said.   Among the hardest hit people were the concrete and steelworkers, who busted through the Interstate 880 roadway to exposevehicles that time and again contained mangled bodies, saidWilliams, from Aurora, Colo., who spoke to a fortuitously-timedSociety for Traumatic Stress Studies convention here over theweekend.   The Veterans Administration sent stress counselors to the Nimitzhighway, to help the former soldiers talk through their feelings,Williams said.   The convention, planned a year ago, brought 500 experts instress management to the Bay area. They fanned out to disastersites, suicide prevention centers and talked to people atbusinesses.   People in the region have swung rapidly through a gamut ofstrong emotions including shock, excitement and euphoria at beingalive, Williams said.   ``Now there is exhaustion,'' Williams said. ``They are feeling alittle helpless as reality is sinking in.''</TEXT></DOC>
