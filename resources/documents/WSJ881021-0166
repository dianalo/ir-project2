Sales also rose 9%, to $845.7 million from $776.7 million.    Colman M. Mockler Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said the increases reflected the &quot;continuing success of strategies to accelerate earnings growth and cash flow.&quot; Gillette early last year began a restructuring that included reductions in employment and the sale of some equity interests.    For the nine months, net increased 21%, to $207 million, or $1.82 a share, from $171.6 million, or $1.49 a share. Sales rose 13%, to $2.61 billion from $2.30 billion.    Gillette earlier this year escaped from a hostile shareholder, Coniston Partners of New York, and continues to figure in Wall Street takeover rumors.    Gillette's shares rose sharply in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $38.50 each, up $1.75. </TEXT></DOC>
