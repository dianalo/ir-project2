Ride told a Senatecommittee Wednesday the United States and other nations in the worldneed to undertake a comprehensive study of the Earth in learn how toprotect the planet from the destructive influences of humanity.   Ride, the first American woman in space, said science nowrecognizes that activities of civilization ``have begun to affectthe conditions of the planet'', but there is little fundamentalunderstanding of how the Earth's weather, geology, oceans and icereact together to influence the environment.   ``We do not yet understand how our planet works,'' she said.``The Earth is a very complicated place. It has to be studied as asystem.''   Ride said a project called Mission to Planet Earth would, for thefirst time, study the Earth in a way that would relate to each otherall of the natural and human forces that influence the planet.   She was one of three witness testifying in support of the projectbefore the Senate committee on commerce, science and transportation.   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., a member of the committee, said there is aneed for the mission because humans are beginning to realize thatindustrial chemicals and gases released into the atmosphere have thepotential of affecting life on the planet by changing the weatherand climate.   He said most nations already recognize the need to halt releaseof chemicals that erode the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere, andthat carbon dioxide and other gases from industry may be affectingthe Earth's climate through the so-called ``greenhouse effect.''   The greenhouse effect is a planetary warming caused by certaingases in the atmosphere that trap heat from the sun. Most of thesegases, such as carbon dioxide, are produced mainly by the burning offossil fuels.   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, chairman of the committee, said that thecosts for the mission have been estimated at $20 to $30 billion outto the year 2010. Ride said the cost would be about a billiondollars a year, and that foreign nations could pay a share.   The former astronaut, who joined the faculty at StanfordUniversity after leaving NASA, said Mission to Planet Earth wouldinvolve nine instrumented satellites, experiments aboard theproposed space station, science stations on Earth, and a datahandling system that would analyze all of the collected information.   Ride said that the project would require the cooperation andparticipation of all the Earth's nations. Some nations, she said,could provide at least two of the satellites and most countriescould establish and operate ground monitoring stations to gathermeasurements from all over the globe.   Another witness, Don L. Anderson of the California Institute ofTechnology, said a coordinated effort between earth, space, oceanand atmospheric studies would be needed to understand how eachelement affects the weather, climate and rainfall on the planet.   He said with a thorough study of Earth from a variety ofperspectives would enable scientists within 20 years to makeaccurate predictions about weather, the changes in geology andclimate, and how human actions affect the planet.   Lennard A. Fisk, chief of space sciences at the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration, said the agency already hasmade organizational steps toward starting a major effort to studyEarth. He said specific plans will be presented to congress in June,including plans for satellites.</TEXT></DOC>
