These regulations govern the exercise of mineral rights withinnational Park System units in connection with valid mining claims heldunder the mining Law of 1872. The existing regulations were promulgatedin 1977. Since that time, the NPS has become aware that the regulationscontain a provision that could be interpreted to preclude the use of waterby mining claimants who have not used water in the past regardless of theenvironmental soundness of their proposed operations. As a result, theNPS is proposing to revise these provisions to clarify that claimants mayuse water in connection with their mining operations provided that theirproposed use is authorized under State law. The NPS also is proposing tomake one technical change to update a section of the regulations to applyto all units of the National Park System in Alaska, not just national monuments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received on or before July 5, 1989 tobe assured of receiving consideration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Please submit written comments to the Mining and MineralsBranch, Land Resources Division, National Park Service, P.O.

These rights are maintained as long as the claimantsfulfill the requirements for retaining the claims. In addition, a validmineral discovery generally affords the claimant with the option to taketheir claims to patent, whereby they acquire title to the property withinthe boundary of their claims. When units of the National Park System were established, after the enactmentof the 1872 Mining Law, they were statutorily closed to the operation ofthe mining laws with the exception of the following six units: Death ValleyNational Monument, Crater Lake National Park, Mt. McKinley National Park(now part of Denali National Park and Preserve), Glacier Bay National Monument(now part of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve), Coronado NationalMemorial, and Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. Today, 24 National ParkSystem units have mining claims within their boundaries. The claims wereeither located during the period when the units enumerated above were opento the location of mining claims, or on public lands that were later incorporatedinto a new or expanded unit of the National Park System. Where the claimshave not been extinguished by Federal acquisition, through successful challengeof their validity, or through the failure of claimants to comply with proceduralrequirements, the claimants continue to have a legal right to develop theminerals. Concerned both with the number of claims that were being filed in the sixunits open to mineral entry, and with the potential adverse impacts topark resources and values if mineral extraction activities were not properlycontrolled, Congress passed the mining in the Parks Act in 1976 (16 U.S.C.1901 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Through this Act, Congress repealed the applicationof the mining law to those six National Park System units that were opento mineral entry and location. Congress also directed the Secretary ofthe Interior to promulgate regulations governing ``all activities resultingfrom the exercise of valid existing mineral rights on patented and unpatentedclaims within any area of the National Park System * * *'' (16 U.S.C. 1902).The NPS promulgated the regulations pursuant to the Mining In The ParksAct on January 26, 1977, and codified them at 36 CFR Part 9, Subpart A.As directed by Congress, the regulations govern all mineral activitiesin connection with both patented and unpatented claims within any unitof the National Park System, no matter when the claim was located or patented,and without regard to whether access to the claim is across federally ownedor controlled lands. The existing regulations at 36 CFR Part 9, Subpart A have been in effectfor the past 11 years. In applying the regulations in Alaska, the NPS hasbecome aware that they contain language regarding the use of water thatunintentionally could prove to be a ``catch-22'' to claimants. A literalinterpretation of the regulations requires that claimants have a perfectedwater right before they use water in connection with their mining operations;however, to secure a perfected water right claimants must use water. Thisapproach, based on an appropriative State water system, fails to recognizealternative State systems or variations for allocating water. To remedythis situation, the NPS proposes to have claimants follow State law regardingthe use of water in connection with mineral development on their claimsinside parks. A claimant's compliance with State water law requirementswill be one of seveal factors considered by the NPS in determining whetherto approve a proposed plan of operations under the NPS's regulations. Otherfactors exist at 36 CFR 9.10, <T3>Plan of operations approval. </T3>NPS is also proposing to clarifythat in Alaska the Supplemental Claim Information Statement can be usedin all units of the National Park System not just national monuments. Adetailed discussion of these proposed changes is set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="85">Proposed Revisions to the Existing 36 CFR Part 9, Subpart A Regulations</ITAG>Existing andSection;9.8 Use of water Existing andSection;9.8 (a) and (b) specify the circumstances under whichwater may be used from a source within a National Park System unit in connectionwith a mining operations. The existing regulatory language could be interpretedto preclude the NPS Regional Director from approving a plan of operationswhich requires the use of water unless the claimant has a perfected waterright under an appropriative State water law system. This result was notintended. The regulations do not expressly recognize other State law systemsunder which water rights are established or decided. For example, a Statemay allow an operator to use water on a mining claim with only a conditionalright (for example, a water use permit from the appropriate State). However,the existing regulations at andSection;9.8 could be interpreted to precludeNPS's approval of a proposed plan unless the operator possesses a ``perfectedright,'' and can demonstrate possession of a perfected right with appropriateevidence (for example, a certificate of appropriation). To rectify thistechnical problem, the NPS proposes to delete references to perfected waterrights, priority dates and continued beneficial use. In their stead, theNPS proposes to include language that the claimant possess a State recognizedwater right. In addition, the NPS proposes to revise the regulations to allow the NPSto use any water systems on Federal lands within unit boundaries in thecase of emergencies such as fires or when human lives are at risk. Thissubsection is numbered as new andSection;9.8(b). Existing andSection; 9.9 Plan of operationsThe NPS proposes to replace the reference to ``a National Monument in Alaska''in andSection; 9.9(b)(5) with ``a unit of the National Park System in Alaska.''Under existing andSection; 9.9(b)(5), mining claimants with unpatented miningclaims in National Monuments in Alaska must submit completed SupplementalClaim Information Statements as part of their plans of operations. Thissubsection was adopted in 1979 after a Presidential Proclamation underthe 1906 Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431-33) substantially expanded theNational Park System to include a number of National Monuments. The AlaskaNational Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (16 U.S.C. 3101 <T3>et seq.</T3>) subsequently expanded the National Park System in Alaskaand/or redesignated several units as National Parks and Preserves, NationalHistoric Parks and a National Wild River. Thus, the reference in andSection;9.9(b)(5) needs to be updated to reflect the change in park unit titlesand to clarify that claimants with unpatented mining claims in any unitof the National Park System in Alaska must submit the Supplemental ClaimInformation Statement with their plans of operations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation</ITAG>The policy of the NPS, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunityto participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested personsmay submit written comments regarding this proposed rule to the above notedaddress. Because communications can be difficult in Alaska, where a numberof parties concerned with these proposed regulations live, the NPS is providinga 60-day public comment period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federal Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rulemaking does not contain information collection requirements thatrequire approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance With Other Laws</ITAG>In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the NPS has prepared an environmental assessment (EA)of these proposed regulations. The EA examines whether implementation ofthe proposed regulations will be a major Federal action that would havea significant effect on the quality of the human environment, requiringthe preparation of an environmental impact statement. The EA is on filein the following NPS offices: Mining and Minerals Branch, Land ResourcesDivision, Room 3223, 1100 L Street NW., Washington, DC (P.O. Box 37127(WASO 660), Washington, DC 20013-7127); the Mining and Minerals Branch,Land Resources Division, Room 221, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood,Colorado (P.O. Box 25287, Denver, Colorado 80225-0287); and the AlaskaRegional Office, Room 206, 2525 Gambell Street, Anchorage, Alaska (Anchorage,Alaska 99503). The EA will be available for public inspection and commentfor a period running concurrently with the comment period for these proposedregulations.The NPS has determined and the Department of the Interior has certifiedthat this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>).This proposed rule has been reviewed in conformity with Executive Order12291 and has been classified as ``not major.'' This action does not constitutea major rule since its implementation will not result in: (i) An annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; (ii) major increases incosts or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State orlocal governments, or a geographic region; or (iii) significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or the ability of U.S. based enterprises to compete with foreign basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 9</ITAG>Environmental protection, Mines, National Parks, Oil and gas exploration,Public Lands_Mineral resources, Public lands_Rights-of-way.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 9_[AMENDED]</ITAG>For reasons set out in the preamble, Title 36, Chapter I, Part 9, SubpartA of the Code of Federal Regulations, is proposed to be amended as setforth below.1.
