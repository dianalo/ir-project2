Has there been a sudden rush of hackingoffences which have threatened individuals or the security of the state?andO;Well, no, although Emma Nicholson has a We of rather dubious examples of whatcould happen if hackers performed certain activities while logged on tocertain computers.andM;Has there been a groundswell in public opinion, then, that makes itimperative to send a few hackers to prison to discourage others? Not at aB;the average person's lack of understanding of computing is matched only bythe corresponding lack among MPs.andP;  In any case, existing laws including theTheft Acts, the Copyright Acts, and laws relating to Criming Damage (alreadyapplied to damaging data held on computer) cover abuses remarkably similar tothe chief problems cited by Ms Nicholson.andM;What seems to have happened is .andP;  that the ancient British disease of secrecyhas combined with the equally ancient British diseases of slovenliness andfear of the new, producing an attitude to computers and those expert in theiruse that can only be described as primitive.andP;  'I' hue some information,therefore 'you' mustn't be allowed to see it, no matter how trivial it is.andO;'I' have pathetic security systems in place on my computer systems, therefore'you' must be sent to prison for accidentally breaching them.andP;  'I' don'tunderstand computers, therefore 'you', who do, must be prevented from doinganything with them as much as possible.andM;The Anti-hacking Bill is born of fear and ignorance, aiming to make criminalsof tbe innocent while existing and perfectly applicable laws are not enforcedbecause the victims of computer crime don't want to report it to the police.andO;What's really needed is a firm definition of information and the rights toit, with suitable penalties for stealing information without actually andphysically removing any material object with the intent permanently todeprive (the legal definition of theft).andM;The situation - and what should be watched closely in case Emma Nicholson'saim of prompting and influencing Government-sponsored legislation comes topass - is reminiscent of 1911.andP;  In that year, according to MPs, there werespies everywhere.andP;  They passed secrets - like hackers on bulletin boards -and damaged the security, of the state by giving information to foreignpowers.andP;  So, despite all the existing laws, a new one was created to make itan offence to reveal previously undisclosed material; the Official SecretsAct resulted from this wave of moral hysteria.andM;Will 1990 become another 1911? Probably not, since the English Law Commissionhas been listening carefuUy to critics of the Nicholson Bill and isjustifiably wary of creating new offences that are unnecessarily restrictiveof individual freedoms and practically unenforceable.andM;Apart from a minor extension to the Theft Act, the Commission's recentWorking Paper decided, &quot;our provisional conclusion is that the generalcriminal law is sufficient to deal with most of the computer misuse we haveidentified&quot;.andM;Only on hacking was the Commission undecided, inviting comment frominterested parties.andM;The computer industry should make its feelings felt.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
