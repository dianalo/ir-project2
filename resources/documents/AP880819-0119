TheU.S.-educated lawyer, the nation's first civilian leader in 26years, immediately called for reforms.   But student leaders rejected the choice of Maung Maung, who isseen as a figurehead for the military, and called for a nationwidestrike to press for an end to one-party rule, said a Westerndiplomat in Rangoon, the capital.   Students led bloody street demonstrations on Aug. 8-12 thatended the 17-day rule of Maung Maung's hard-line predecessor, SeinLwin.   Burma's official Radio Rangoon said Maung Maung, 63, wasselected during emergency meetings of the central committee of theBurma Socialist Program Party and of the People's Assembly, Burma'sparliament. The radio was monitored in Bangkok.   In a radio speech, Maung Maung later urged the party centralcommittee to fulfill the people's aspirations ``as soon as possibleand as much as possible.''   ``We need to review ourselves'' because the violentdemonstrations showed that ``consultation with the people becameweakened,'' he said.   He said the ``severe storm'' of protests hit the nation while``fundamental economic and political reforms'' were being debated.   Maung Maung said it has been almost a year since former partychairman Ne Win spoke of the need for economic reform. He said someyouths have been deprived of opportunities to study and thatefforts are being made at educational reforms.   The Western diplomat said by telephone from Rangoon: ``Studentshave called for a nationwide strike on Monday. They're agitatingfor abolition of one-party rule. The more militant (student)leaders are disappointed.''   He said students called for the strike in leaflets circulatedduring a peaceful rally in front of Rangoon General Hospital.Japan's Kyodo news service, reporting from Rangoon, said 15,000people took part in the rally.   Kyodo also said 100,000 people marched in the northern city ofMandalay, the country's second-largest city, in the second straightday of mass pro-democracy demonstrations. Kyodo said provincialgovernment workers walked off of their jobs to join thedemonstration. The city's population is 600,000.   Maung Maung is one of only two civilians in the top ranks of thegovernment hierarchy.   His selection was a surprise. Most Burma watchers had predictedthe new party boss would be chosen from among the clique of activeand retired top military officers who supported former leader NeWin's system of rigid socialist economics, strict military controland international isolation.   Maung Maung is considered a relative moderate, and thought moreacceptable than other figures to Burmese who took to the streets inwaves in the past two weeks to topple Sein Lwin and press demandsfor an end to a quarter-century of military dominated,authoritarian rule.   The government said 95 people were killed last week in battlesbetween security forces and anti-government demonstrators, butdiplomats said hundreds may have been killed.   After Burma gained independence in 1948, Maung Maung studied atRangoon University. He later received a doctorate in internationallaw from Utrecht University in the Netherlands and a law degreefrom Yale University, where he spent two years as a visitinglecturer in the early 1960s.   After the 1962 coup, he served as Ne Win's legal adviser. He waselected to the party central committee at the first party congressin 1972, and in 1974 became a member of the State Council, thehighest state organ.   In a 1974 autobiography, ``To a Soldier Son,'' he wroteadmiringly of the military but also praised the ideals of youthfulactivism. He is seen as a figurehead for military powerbrokers buta leader who can calm the protests.   Maung Maung was elected to the party's Central ExecutiveCommittee in 1977 and was considered the country's fifth-rankedleader. He resigned from that post in 1985, and later becameattorney general.   The only other civilian in the military-dominated government isEducation Minister Kyaw Sein.   A Western diplomat in Rangoon said the capital was calm but thatmilitary forces were deployed around the Pyithu Hluttaw, theParliament building in northwestern Rangoon.   Sein Lwin is a former army general criticized for his brutalsuppression of dissidents. He replaced Ne Win, who took power in a1962 coup and ruled the country for 26 years until his resignation.   Since Sein Lwin's ouster, various activist groups havecirculated leaflets and posters, presented formal statements to thegovernment, and held street rallies to demand greater democracy.   Brang Seng, leader of the Kachin guerrilla army and vicepresident of the National Democratic Front of 10 rebel groups, toldKyodo today that the front ``will join the students and citizensfighting in the movement for democracy to establish a provisionalgovernment for national reconciliation.''   ``As long as the one-party dictatorship continues, we willcontinue our struggle against whoever is chosen as the (next)leader,'' he was quoted as saying.   Protesters' demands include a multi-party system, economicreforms, release of political prisoners and restoration of studentorganizations.   Under Ne Win, Burma was transformed from one of Southeast Asia'swealthiest countries to one of its poorest, rivaled only bycommunist-ruled Laos and Cambodia. Rampant inflation, foodshortages and other economic hardships fueled popular resentmentagainst the government.</TEXT></DOC>
