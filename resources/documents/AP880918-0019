Saw Maung, 59, widely regarded as a hard-line officer and aright-hand man of former President Sein Lwin, promised to holdmultiparty elections once law and order is restored in Burma, theradio broadcast said. Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 after bloodyclashes between troops and unarmed protesters.   Shortly after the broadcast Sunday, thousands of people surgedinto the streets of Rangoon in a spontaneous rejection of the newregime and shouted for others to come out of their homes withweapons.   The protesters felled trees and threw them across the roads toobstruct military traffic. But no military movements were spottedby nightfall.   The coup came a day after soldiers shot at protesters marchingon government buildings in Rangoon to demand the end of 26 years ofrepressive rule by the Burma Socialist Program Party, the solelegal party. The protests have been led by students and monks andincluded striking civil servants.   Saw Maung, the defense minister and Burma's fourth leader in twomonths, identified himself as chairman of the Peace RestorationCommittee.   A later broadcast named the other 18 military officers in thecommittee, including the vice chiefs of the army, navy and airforce. It said authorities imposed an immediate 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.curfew and banned public gatherings but did not specify if that wasnationwide or only in Rangoon.   All government and state bodies were dissolved, including localadministrations nationwide, it said. All striking governmentworkers were told to return to work by Sept. 26 or face dismissal.   Nationwide protests since July have forced the resignation oftwo leaders and more recent strikes, demonstrations, looting andlawlessness have paralyzed the economy and pushed the nation on theverge of anarchy.   The statements Sunday said the military had taken over stateauthority ``to curb further deterioration of the general situationin the country.''   It said military authorities would ``restore law and order,peace and tranquility in the country ... and ease the dailylivelihood of the people.''   ``After accomplishing the above objectives, (the regime will)hold general elections under a multiparty system. Political partieswhich accept and practice true democracy can prepare for thegeneral elections from now on.''   The broadcast said the election supervision commission formedearlier by Maung Maung's government would be retained. Maung Maung,a Western-educated lawyer, on Aug. 19 became the nation's firstcivilian leader since the 1962 military coup that installed theBurma Socialist Program Party.   Maung Maung offered general elections under a multiparty system,but demonstrators demanded an interim government to conduct thepolling.   There had been several signs of military resistance to thegovernment's response to its opposition.   Security forces have sided with protesters in several towns,including Victoria Point in the southernmost Mergui provincebordering Thailand. On Sept. 9, about 500 servicemen mutinied andjoined protest marches in Rangoon in the first major militarydefections in the capital.   On Saturday, Buddhist monks and armed students took over agovernment building after a soldier opened fire on two protesters.The 24 soldiers inside surrendered, and the monks and studentsdisguised them as protesters and got them past a heavily armed,100,000-strong mob threatening to behead them.   Up to 500,000 demonstrators, including striking governmentworkers and policemen, took part n marches Saturday in Rangoon.   State-run Radio Rangoon said Saturday the government had orderedsoldiers to support the state and national unity.   Security forces killed scores of people in quelling student-ledprotests in March and June. That set the stage for the July 23resignation of Ne Win, who had ruled since he staged the 1962military coup.   More protests flared after Sein Lwin, a former general,succeeded him. By government count, at least 112 people were killedin Rangoon during the riots against Sein Lwin, who resigned Aug. 12after 17 days in power.   Protesters blame the rigid socialism of the ruling party forturning resource-rich Burma into one of the poorest countries inAsia.</TEXT></DOC>
