Bush said he has made no decision concerning the TreasuryDepartment's suggestion that one way to raise money for thegovernment insurance fund backing Sandamp;L deposits would be a fee ofabout 25 cents on every $100 in federally insured Sandamp;L, bank andcredit union accounts.   ``There seems to be some controversy around it (the deposit feeoption), but that doesn't mean that any thinking along those linesshould cease,'' the president said.   Bush brushed off the question of whether the fee would violatehis ``no new taxes'' pledge, saying, ``I've been around for a longtime. I don't remember hearing people talk about the fee that wentinto the FDIC or FSLIC (insurance funds) as a tax.''   Meanwhile, the top federal Sandamp;L regulator said some nervouscustomers are withdrawing money from savings and loans because ofthe deposit fee trial balloon.   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, saidin an interview Thursday with The Associated Press that ``there isnervousness'' based on a misunderstanding of what has been discussed.   ``We've had problems since yesterday (Wednesday),'' Wall said.``There have been cases where they say, `I don't like what I heardon TV, I'm taking my money out.'''   No Sandamp;Ls are in trouble as a result of depositors' reaction, hesaid, but ``I'm concerned that people don't cause themselves lossesby cashing in a CD (certificate of deposit) early'' and thusincurring penalties.   Wall stressed that the administration is only examining thedeposit fee option at this stage, not proposing one, and the feewould apply to all federally insured institutions, including banksand credit unions.   Karl Hoyle, a bank board spokesman, said the agency surveyed Sandamp;LsThursday night and found ``no outflows of any significance that wecan attribute to anything that's been said.''   He said the bank board's chief worry is ``not concern aboutwhat's been happening. It's concern about what might happen.''   Hoyle said the bank board is trying to emphasize to worrieddepositors that the debate within Congress and the administration isnot about whether additional money should be spent to protectdeposits, but about how it should be raised.   Earlier, in testimony before the House Budget Committee, Wallsaid only that ``there are clearly better ideas'' for raising moneythan a deposit fee. He said if one were imposed it should be broadlybased, applying also to money market mutual funds offered bybrokerage firms.   On a related topic, Wall said today that some accountants haveadmitted involving themselves improperly with management of savingsand loan institutions they were auditing to declare them financiallyhealthy.   Wall, speaking on NBC's ``Today'' show, said in some cases,auditors simply did not do a good enough job in seeking to determineif a particular institution was financially healthy.   However, he said, ``In some cases it is clearly individuals whohappen to be employees of some of the (accounting) firms ... whowere involved in these undertakings with the management of theinstitution, all of them setting out to do wrong.''   ``... We have had some settlements in terms of the allegationswhere people have admitted to involvement,'' he said.   In his congressional testimony Thursday, Wall said the bank boardwas suing accounting firms, including three of the so-called ``BigEight'' firms, for failing to uncover losses and abuses in Sandamp;Ls thatlater failed.   He did not identify the three firms, but bank board spokesmanWilliam Fulwider said the FSLIC has sued two: Deloitte, Haskins andSells, and Touche Ross and Co. The insurance fund got jurisdictionover a third suit against Coopers andamp; Lybrand after taking over theinsolvent Sandamp;L that filed it.   Thomas Kelley of the American Institute of Certified PublicAccountants, insisted in a ``Today'' interview: ``The accountingprofession is not responsible for the savings and loan crisis. ...Auditors don't give clean bills of health. Secondly, what they do isreport on the fairness of the financial statements.''   On a related topic, Wall is taking issue with the GeneralAccounting Office, which told the budget committee that savings andloan regulators are heading for a cash crunch.   The GAO, an auditing and investigative agency for Congress, saidthe government insurance fund for Sandamp;Ls ``has made financialcommitments that on a preliminary basis appear to exceed by about$26 billion its expected cash flows over the next 10 years.''   Wall said in the interview with the AP, ``We have not exceededour cash flow,'' but acknowledged that the insurance fund could verysoon be overcommitted if regulators continued their current pace ofclosing and merging insolvent Sandamp;Ls.   He said the bank board spent or promised to spend $38 billionlast year to ``resolve'' the cases of 205 Sandamp;Ls and temporarily``stabilize'' 18 others. About 350 other insolvent institutionsremain open. It will cost about $35 billion to close them, the GAOestimates.   Wall, while maintaining his agency was not overcommitted, saidthat unless Congress acts quickly to earmark more money toward thecrisis, his agency may have to leave hundreds of insolventinstitutions open.</TEXT></DOC>
