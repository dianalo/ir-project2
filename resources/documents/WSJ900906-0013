Ralston Purina and its Continental Baking Co. unit werethe largest food processors to be targeted yesterday withso-called regulatory letters from the FDA, according toagency officials. The food industry has been anxiouslyawaiting the first batch of letters as an indication of howthe FDA plans to curb the proliferation of dubious healthclaims in recent years.</LP><TEXT>   One FDA official said that the six companies were singledout because the agency believed it could, if necessary,develop strong enforcement cases against them under the Food,Drug and Cosmetic Act. In its letters, the agency demandedthat the companies justify their oat bran claims or stopmaking them altogether. Typically, companies are given 10days to respond to regulatory letters.   &quot;We are, in effect, trying to establish the boundaries ofwhat we think is appropriate in the way of health claims andwhat we think is inappropriate,&quot; an FDA official said.   Last night, a Ralston Purina spokesman in St. Louisconfirmed that the FDA had challenged claims being made fortwo products containing oat bran -- Ralston Purina's Oat Chexcereal and Continental Baking's Oatmeal Goodness bread.   &quot;We're just beginning to review the matter,&quot; said thespokesman, Pat Farrell. &quot;We believe that we are in compliancewith all labeling requirements regarding all our products.&quot;   Oat Chex went on the market in September 1989 withexpectations that it would &quot;benefit from continuing consumerinterest in oat bran,&quot; according to Ralston Purina's latestannual report. Oatmeal Goodness bread, another new entry, hasbeen &quot;a highly successful product&quot; for Continental Baking,the nation's largest producer of bakery goods, the annualreport said.   It couldn't be determined last night exactly what the FDAfound objectionable about the claims for these two products.Moreover, officials wouldn't identify the other companiesthat received letters from the agency's Center for FoodSafety and Applied Nutrition.   In this instance, the agency is intent on curbing claimsabout how fiber helps lower cholesterol levels and reduce therisk of a heart attack. Oat bran is a source of solublefiber. The thrust of the regulatory letters sent by facsimilemachine yesterday was that the products don't contain enoughoat bran to make any difference from a health standpoint.   In most cases, the product has less than one gram of oatbran in each serving, according to an FDA official. Clinicalstudies show that it takes 50 grams a day to have beneficialeffects, he added. What's more, the agency still hasn'tdecided whether oat bran does reduce the risk of heartattack.</TEXT></DOC>
