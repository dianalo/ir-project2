Addressing a meeting of young party activists and studentsSaturday, Suvar said the country's main concern was how to checkspiraling inflation which last month hit 290 percent.   ``Unless the galloping inflation is stopped this year, theeconomy may collapse causing social explosion and catastrophicconsequences'' Tanjug quoted him as saying.   Living standards have plummeted to half their level since 1980,and long lines have been forming to purchase the cheap dark breadthat bakeries sell during the early morning hours.   In addition, Yugoslavia owes $21 billion to foreign creditors andhas a 17 percent unemployment rate.   Last week, the divided party leadership held a three-day sessionbut again failed to agree on how to heal the country's worseningpolitical and economic ills, despite warnings from the military thatit might become active in resolving the crisis.   Suvar told the meeting Saturday that the party session ``shouldhave cut short all quarrels and social arguments.''   ``All problems can be solved only if there is no bloodshed on anationalist basis,'' Politika Ekspres, a Belgrade daily, quoted himas saying.   The main clash at the session, which ended Wednesday, occurredbetween factions advocating greater political pluralism and moredemocracy and those favoring increased central party control toovercome Yugoslavia's worst crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
