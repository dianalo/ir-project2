DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Business Week's former broadcast editor, SeymourG. ``Rudy'' Ruderman, has pleaded guilty to mail fraud in an insidertrading scheme, admitting he illegally used advance material fromthe magazine to buy and sell securities.   Ruderman admitted on Thursday making $15,000 between January 1986and last July in securities trades, using not-yet-publishedinformation from upcoming issues of the nation's biggest businessweekly.   The 62-year-old editor waived indictment and pleaded guilty totwo counts of mail fraud before U.S. District Judge Robert Ward, whoreleased him on $100,000 bond.   Ward scheduled sentencing for March 8, 1989. Ruderman faces amaximum penalty of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines oneach count.   Ruderman, who had broadcast market and business news for BusinessWeek since 1981, was fired Aug. 12 for failing to disclose all hisstock trades and the full extent of his holdings, in violation ofthe magazine's ethics code.   The first criminal charges were filed in the widening scandallast August. William Dillon, a stock broker who had been fired byMerrill Lynch andamp; Co., for suspcious trades was charged with mailfraud.   Seven employees of Business Week's printer also lost their jobs,a result of an in-house investigation that allegedly found workerssold advance copies of Business Week. Two brokers at two otherinvestment firms also were fired.   Ruderman did not report, write or edit stories for Business Week.But he broadcast a business news report several times a day from themagazine's office in midtown Manhattan to radio stations in NewYork, Boston, Philadelphia and Fort Wayne, Ind.   According to the charges, Ruderman used information obtainedlargely from Business Week's market-sensitive ``Inside Wall Street''column to buy and sell securities on 50 occasions.   ``A security that received a favorable mention in that columngenerally increased in price in the period immediately followingpublic dissemination of Business Week,'' court papers said.   In entering his plea, Ruderman said he probably lost more moneythan he made in his securities trading.   According to the charges, Ruderman regularly received a pageproof of the ``Inside Wall Street'' column on Thursdays _ hoursbefore its official release to the public _ to make sure companiesmentioned in the column were not referred to in radio broadcasts.Ruderman also was free to use the information in his weekendreports, which were taped on Fridays.   Instead, Ruderman bought shares or options to buy shares, andcaused unidentified ``other persons'' to purchase securities incompanies receiving favorable mention in the upcoming column.   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani refused to characterize who the``other persons'' were but said the investigation was continuing.   He also commended Business Week and its publisher, McGraw-HillInc., for their cooperation.   Ruderman conducted transactions in the securities of suchcompanies as Champion Spark Plug, Chrysler Corp., MCA Inc., GettyPetroleum and Jefferies Group Inc.   Giuliani noted that Ruderman was charged with mail fraud forvictimizing the magazine, which is delivered by mail.   Ruderman was not charged with securities fraud for insidertrading, the prosecutor said, because the U.S. Supreme Court split4-4 on that issue last year in the case of former Wall StreetJournal reporter R. Foster Winans.   The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the mail and wire fraudconvictions of Winans for using advance knowledge of upcomingJournal columns to make illegal trading profits. But the court splitover a broad interpretation of ``misappropriation'' of confidentialinformation that would have included revealing yet-to-be publishednewspaper and magazine stories.   Noting that the penalty for mail fraud and securities fraud werethe same, Giuliani said ``from a criminal (law) point of view, thisis a safer way to achieve the same results.''</TEXT></DOC>
