She did not have tuberoussclerosis. Using polyvinyl alcohol foam (Ivalon) particles, immediateembolization of a main artery feeding the tumor - the posterior branchof the left renal artery - was performed. Three months after embolization,intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA) showed this mainfeeder was still occluded. This case and others encountered in our reviewof the literature underscore the usefulness of therapeutic embolizationfor renal angiomyolipoma.</TEXT></DOC>
