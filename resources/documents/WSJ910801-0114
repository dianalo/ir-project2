The Middle East is in anuproar again as a resurgent Iraq and Iran threaten SaudiArabia. Suddenly, North Korea, emboldened by its new nuclearweapons, invades South Korea. Because of defense cuts, youhave fewer fighter planes, combat divisions and ships at yourdisposal than did President Bush. Worse, you've alreadyshifted some U.S. forces out of the Pacific to the MiddleEast. What do you do now?                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   NEWPORT, R.I. -- That's the kind of world America'snational-security strategists gathered here last month tocontemplate. They saw the New World Order -- and found thatit isn't necessarily a pretty sight.   The occasion was the Naval War College's Global War Game,which annually brings together government officials, formerofficials and outside analysts to act out roles as America'stop national security decision-makers. They gather in asimulated White House situation room to anticipate the kindsof crises the U.S. is likely to face. The task of those whogathered for the opening week of the three-week game --including this reporter -- was to figure out a U.S. strategyfor President Bush's New World Order.   The game players discovered that the world of the 1990s islikely to force the U.S. into shotgun military marriages,shifting coalitions and unconventional cohabitationarrangements. &quot;The New World Order is messy,&quot; says RobertMurray, head of the Center for Naval Analyses, who played therole of president in the game. &quot;I don't know that the worldis any messier than it's ever been. It's just that, with theSoviet Union out of the picture, somehow the messiness ismore apparent.&quot;   The evaporation of U.S.-Soviet competition means regionalpowers -- such as Iran, North Korea and China -- will feelfreer to flex their muscles. The Soviets also have lost thepower to restrain their onetime client states, such as Iraq.The disintegration of the Warsaw Pact already is unleashingethnic tensions. And of course, there is always thepossibility that the Soviet Union could turn back into anadversary.   To top it off, a growing band of countries will havenuclear, chemical and biological weapons and ballisticmissiles to deliver them. U.S. analysts think that besidesthe five nations that openly possess nuclear weapons, fourothers have nuclear arms and at least six more are on thethreshold. In addition, 19 have ballistic missiles, 19 havechemical weapons programs and 12 have biological weaponsprograms. In the face of these potential hot spots, the U.S.will have fewer big military bases around the world, bothbecause it can't afford them and because the end of the ColdWar has made other countries less interested in having them.   Against this backdrop, consider a problem before&quot;President Murray&quot; and his aides. They are trying to decidehow to position the shrunken American military forcesavailable in 1998.   Everyone agrees that oil-rich Persian Gulf states willstill need protecting, and there is a consensus that the U.S.should have a military presence in the region. A solution:Station a small planning force on the ground somewhere in theMiddle East, operate a naval task force permanently out ofsome friendly port, and assign significant numbers of troopsand ships to be available to move in quickly in a crisis.   That forces the leaders to make a painful choice. Themilitary forces dedicated to Middle East duty have to comefrom somewhere. Someone suggests they can be drawn out of thePacific, as many were during the war against Iraq. That meansreducing the American presence in Asia just as that area isexploding in economic importance. It also might triggerJapanese militarization and regional domination to fill thegap left by the U.S. Is that what the U.S. really wants?   There was a glum prognosis that the U.S. might be unableto handle more than one regional crisis at a time. But gameplayers found at least partial solutions:   -- Instead of focusing on traditional military bases, suchas the soon-to-be-closed Clark Air Base in the Philippines,the U.S. should seek numerous agreements giving it access toforeign friends' facilities in a time of crisis. One conceptis something military strategists call &quot;co-located operatingbases.&quot; Those are foreign facilities where the U.S. canpre-position military equipment, conduct some routineoperations and carry out regular military exercises with thehost country. The bases then would be available to take a bigwave of U.S. troops in a crisis.   -- The U.S. often may have to cobble together ad hoccoalitions, just as it did in the war against Iraq. RigidCold War alliances will lose cohesion and relevance, and theU.S. will be expected to act as the world's lone superpower.Yet it won't have the economic largesse or militarywherewithal to handle every contingency alone. Future U.S.presidents may spend as much time on the phone seekingforeign cooperation as President Bush did last fall.   -- Military exercises with friendly armies will become farmore important, both to make political statements to would-befoes and to prepare for crises.   There is a related problem even less understood as the1990s begin -- the role of intelligence. The U.S.intelligence community is likely to see its budgetsrestrained in step with the defense budget. But it will haveto continue performing most of its traditional functions --monitoring Soviet compliance with arms-control agreements,tracking terrorists, predicting political upheavals -- whileshouldering entirely new tasks. In the midst of the gamehere, for instance, the president sternly orders his directorof central intelligence to vigilantly monitor the Sovietconversion of defense industries to civilian use, to verifywhether tank factories really are being turned into washingmachine factories.   There also is a host of sticky intelligence policyquestions. Everyone here assumes that economic competitionwill be as important as political competition. So should theCIA gather and relay to U.S. businesses intelligence onforeign companies?   Such questions lead the game players back to the concernsrunning beneath their deliberations. How can the U.S. leadunless it conquers its economic problems? And how can it hangtogether as a society, much less compete globally, unless itdoes a better job of educating its citizens? Those questionsproduce what Mr. Murray calls an &quot;underlying feeling ofunease about our domestic society&quot; -- something the &quot;leaders&quot;here consider as much a national security issue as thequestion of how many fighter planes will be flying the skiesof the New World Order.   ---   Mr. Seib has covered the White House for the Journal andis about to become a Journal diplomatic correspondent.</TEXT></DOC>
