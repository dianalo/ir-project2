The new rules, published after a decade of consideration, were immediately attacked by both labor and industry, and an industry association moved to challenge the standard in court.    The AFL-CIO's Food and Allied Services Trades Department called the standard &quot;seriously -- and potentially fatally -- flawed,&quot; and said the rules are inadequate to deal with much of the grain-dust problem. AFL-CIO officials said the new standard is stronger than watered-down rules the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed nearly four years ago, but they added that it is still &quot;vague and unenforceable.&quot;    But the National Grain and Feed Association, an industry group, said parts of the standard make demands of the industry that &quot;cannot be justified&quot; by the evidence given the agency, including findings of numerous research projects the group has funded. OSHA liberalized some requirements in the proposal, the group suggested, but they &quot;still appear to be very extensive.&quot; The association yesterday asked the federal appeals court in New Orleans to review the new OSHA standard.    According to OSHA, the standard, which takes effect March 30, 1988, offers protection for more than 155,000 workers, and could save as many as 18 lives and prevent 394 injuries a year.    It also gives employers &quot;maximum flexibility&quot; in limiting buildup of grain dust and controlling ignition, said John Pendergrass, an assistant secretary of labor who heads OSHA. The regulations call for special &quot;housekeeping&quot; procedures in grain-elevator areas near potential sources of ignition, such as grinding equipment or grain dryers. The procedures require employers to remove accumulated dust when it reaches a level of one-eighth of an inch, but they would have the option of wetting down the grain dust or adding oil to the grain.    Employers will also have to develop emergency plans providing workers with an escape from tunnels and galleries, and train employees to deal with potential grain-dust safety hazards.    The new rules, the first federal safety requirements for grain dust, have been the focus of bitter debate since OSHA started drafting a standard to control explosive dust a decade ago. The work began in the winter of 1977, after three elevators exploded in a five-day period, killing 58 workers and seriously injuring 47.    Most explosions in grain elevators and mills start when a spark or discharge ignites powder-fine grain dust that is suspended in air. But most injuries and damage are caused by secondary explosions, which occur when the shock from the first blast lifts layered dust off the floor or equipment and ignites it. Grain-dust explosions are considered more deadly than TNT blasts. A threat of explosion is always present in grain facilities, OSHA said, because of the dry air and dust in confined areas.    In 1983, OSHA wanted to require that floor dust be held generally to a maximum one-eighth of an inch at elevators and milling plants. But the White House budget office insisted on giving employers additional flexibility. The grain industry opposed any rule, preferring to control dust with safety seminars and more loosely structured guidelines.    The OSHA proposal that emerged in January 1984 would have required employers to clean dust from work areas once each shift, install an automatic dust-collection system, or stop work and cut dust levels when an alarm showed sizable dust accumulation. But unions fought for a tougher standard, arguing that the proposal was far too weak.    While in the unions' view the standard announced yesterday is considerably stronger than the 1984 proposal, it still exempts elevators and mills from &quot;wall-to-wall dust control,&quot; said Robert Harbrant, Food and Allied Trades president.    Mr. Harbrant said the standard's limit on allowable dust accumulation in an elevator -- one eighth of an inch for areas around certain ignition sources -- doesn't set any maximum dust level for the rest of the elevator. And about 9,000 grain mills, &quot;the source of many major explosions in recent years,&quot; aren't covered by any dust requirements, he said.    He said that in the past 10 years 59 workers have been killed and 317 seriously injured in more than 190 grain elevator and mill explosions. In 1982, the National Academy of Sciences singled out the control of grain-dust accumulation in elevators and mills as the most critical factor in preventing explosions, and recommended that OSHA propose a standard keeping dust levels below 1/64th of an inch.    OSHA estimates that the standard's net cost to employers, after subtracting property-loss savings, would range from $5.9 million to $33.4 million a year. The rules cover grain-handling facilities including elevators; feed, rice and flour mills; and corn and soybean milling operations. </TEXT></DOC>
