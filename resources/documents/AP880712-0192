Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jesse Jackson's chief platformnegotiator, said, ``Our minority reports are not in there becausewe're still negotiating.''   Jackson has said he may press floor fights in Atlanta nextTuesday on a dozen or more issues, including his call for highertaxes on the wealthy, a Pentagon freeze, more spending on educationand Head Start, no-first-use of nuclear weapons and Palestinianself-determination.   He is expected, however, to take only three or four of his keyissues to the floor for votes. With 1,135 delegates, Jackson canforce debates on any issue, but Dukakis's majority of 2,426 islarge enough to leave no doubt as to who will win the fights.   The proposed platform, hammered out June 25 by the party'splatform writers in Denver, commits the Democrats ``to reverseseven years of voodoo economics,'' to ``more stable defensebudgets,'' to advance notice of plant layoffs and to guaranteed``freedom of reproductive choice ... regardless of ability to pay.''   It avoids any mention of tax increases and does not say howDukakis and the Democrats would deal with the huge federal deficits.   Norton, on her way to a meeting with Jackson, said, ``Thenegotiations are going well.''   The party, in a memorandum appended to the document, said: ``Toavoid delay in printing the platform, all parties have agreed thatthe report on minority planks, which is still under discussion,will be available at the convention.''   The proposed platform, written with the help of onetimePresident Kennedy speechwriter Ted Sorensen, is one-tenth thelength of the 45,000-word tome the Democrats ran on in 1984. Partychairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. said the Democrats would be better servedby a short, visionary statement stripped of special interestlanguage that discomfited some Democrats and delighted Republicans.   The platform, titled ``The Resoration of Competence and theRevival of Hope,'' endorses ``pay equity for working women and nosubstandard wage competition for public contracts''; ``majorincreases'' in child care aid for low- and middle-income families;an indexed minimum wage, and a National Teacher Corps to recruitteachers with scholarships.   The platform also backs expanded support for bilingualeducation; appointment of a national drug czar; a ban on ``copkiller'' bullets; passage of the Equal Rights Amendmment;accelerated research on AIDS ``and protection of the civil rightsof those suffering from AIDS'' or testing positive for the IVantibody.''   It also condemns South Africa as a ``terrorist'' state; endorsessame-day and mail-in voter registration, and decries ``any dilutionof the one-person, one-vote principle''; supports statehood for theDistrict of Columbia and ``greater autonomy for Puerto Rico,'' andpledges ``the full and equal access of women and minorities toelective office and party endorsement.''   ``We believe in an America, neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy,that will promote peace and prevent war _ not by trading weaponsfor hostages, not by sending brave Americans to undefined missionsin Lebanon and Honduras ... not by toasting a tyrant like Marcos asa disciple of democracy, but by maintaining a stable nucleardeterrent sufficient to counter any Soviet threat. ... '' theplatform says.   It calls for reinvigorating the Camp David peace process in theMiddle East and support for Costa Rican President Oscar Arias'peace plan in Central America.   It mentions neither Ronald Reagan nor George Bush by name.</TEXT></DOC>
