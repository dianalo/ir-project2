He isscrambling to salvage some respect for Eastern Europe'scrumbling dictatorship of the proletariat.   He takes issue with a Washington Post dispatch from EastBerlin by Glenn Frankel. He notes that 71% of East Berlinvoters picked left-wing candidates. He follows with adeclaration that the Christian Democratic Party(moderate-to-right leaning) seems to receive its support inthe countryside. Obviously, Mr. Cockburn will go to anylength (and sink to any depth) to support faltering left-wingcauses.</LP><TEXT>   Why did East Berliners lean left in their selection ofpolitical candidates? You need only to look inside our ownCapital's Beltway for the answer. Many East Berliners, liketheir Washington counterparts, are entrenched bureaucratswhose very existence is threatened by a free-market,capital-driven society. Their political views do not remotelyreflect the position of people in the &quot;countryside.&quot;   The political pulse of the East German countryside, likeour own Midwest and South, is always ignored by journalistslike Mr. Cockburn. By the way, sophisticated and hard-workingcitizens of Leipzig and Dresden voted overwhelmingly forCentrists and right-leaning candidates. The ChristianDemocratic Party was supported by more East Germans thanthose voting for the next three largest parties.   D.W. von Arx   Winston-Salem, N.C.   ---   Mr. Cockburn has amazed me by writing sensibly for once(some of the article, anyway). Yes, journalists who stickclose to their hotels get a lopsided view, and the EastGerman Communists' 17% was heavily concentrated in EastBerlin, which seems rather natural, since that's where loyal,ambitious Communists got promoted to. (Conservatives alwaysdo better in the boondocks.) And empty food stores don'tnecessarily mean that people are starving.   But what of those disgracefully high-priced oranges andkiwi fruit? Any commissar with a slide rule could demonstrateeasily that cabbages contain far more Vitamin C and caloriesper mark. Still, nobody is forcing those East Berliners tobuy. &quot;Sell it or smell it]&quot; is the capitalist rule forfruitmongers, and once the novelty value is over, the fruitlady will have to cut the price, toss the oranges in thegarbage or eat them herself.   Prof. Glenn T. Wilson   School of Business   Middle Tennessee State University   Murfreesboro, Tenn.   ---   Mr. Cockburn confuses market mechanisms. While it is truethat &quot;in the Soviet Union prices have been . . . belowequilibrium,&quot; this is not because of &quot;rationing by scarcity.&quot;Rationing has little to do with it. It is because ofgovernment price fixing. When the government sets a pricelower than the equilibrium clearing price, shortages, queuesand black markets ensue.   In capitalism, most prices are not &quot;above equilibrium,&quot; asMr. Cockburn maintains, but at equilibrium since thegovernment does not set the price. If it were aboveequilibrium, more sellers would rush in to take advantage,thereby depressing the price. Nor is there &quot;rationing byprice,&quot; but allocation by price. If you can pay, you get it-- if you can't, you don't. Thus, no shortage, queues orblack markets -- the market clears.   Thomas J. Adams   Sacramento, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
