Leaders of Bonn's three-party coalition agreed late yesterday to levy a tax of 3.9 pfennigs (2.1 cents) per cubic yard of natural gas, starting next year. The compromise measure, which would raise 1.8 billion marks ($969 million) annually, ensures that Bonn's separate tax-overhaul package will win final parliamentary approval Friday. But the latest levy breaks Bonn's pledge not to initiate new taxes as part of the harmonization of tax codes within the EC by 1992.    None of the 12 EC nations currently levies a flat tax on natural gas. However, confronted with a range of alternatives, all of them politically unpleasant, the German government chose to risk angering the EC rather than further dividing its coalition.    The conclusion of talks momentarily ends some of the most divisive bickering ever during the six years of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's rocky coalition government. In particular, representatives of the junior member of the coalition government, the Free Democratic Party, had argued that initiation of the tax next year would hurt Germany's economy at a time when many economists expect slower growth.    Bonn last month slated an increase of about six billion marks in taxes on property insurance, heating oil, gasoline and tobacco for next year. The higher levies will come a year before a general lowering of income taxes, which is to be voted on Friday in the upper house of parliament. As a result, even members of Mr. Kohl's own Christian Democratic Union have recently attacked his government's tax policies. </TEXT></DOC>
