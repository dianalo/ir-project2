SchiffmanStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST </IN><DATELINE> BEIJING  </DATELINE><TEXT>   As China's Communist Party Congress opened yesterday in the Great Hall of the People, the country's 83-year-old paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, sat at center stage. But attention quickly focused on the man seated to his left: Zhao Ziyang, Mr. Deng's heir apparent.    Mr. Zhao, sporting a well-cut suit and a flashy purple tie, delivered a two-and-a-half hour speech that painted the clearest picture to date of the reformist vision of China's future. China, he said, will accelerate economic modernization and use techniques associated with capitalism as long as they promote growth. Mr. Zhao also detailed plans for &quot;political reform,&quot; the difficult process of moving the party away from meddling in government and the economy. &quot;Without reform of the political structure, reform of the economic structure cannot succeed in the end,&quot; said the 69-year-old Mr. Zhao, China's premier and acting party chief.    The tenor of his report to the congress indicated that he and other reformers have established commanding positions in China's leadership, diplomats in Beijing said. At the same time, they added, the speech represented a compromise among the factions that wield power in China, as it included some of the more cautious views of conservatives who believe China has pursued reform too quickly.    In the course of the congress, an event that comes only once every five years, China's aging party leadership must decide whether to maintain or slow the most far-reaching economic reforms since the Communists took power in 1949. It is also expected to confirm Mr. Zhao as party chief, replacing Hu Yaobang, who was removed in January following student demonstrations around the country.    The atmosphere yesterday was upbeat. A 160-piece military brass band kicked off the meeting, blaring the Internationale, the revolutionary socialist hymn, from the deck of the cavernous Great Hall. As Mr. Zhao spoke, two electronic message boards on either side of the podium flashed a series of party slogans.    The speech marked a kind of coming out for Mr. Zhao in his role as heir apparent. He presented himself as a moderate who can balance and unify the disparate interest groups in Mr. Deng's ruling coalition -- as he must if he is going to survive as China's leader in a post-Deng era. To appease reformers, he said the party shouldn't accuse liberals of advocating &quot;bourgeois liberalization,&quot; which is code for unwanted Western ideas. On the other hand, &quot;when a person temporarily falls behind in the reform, we shouldn't dismiss him as being rigid in thinking,&quot; he said.    In his talk, Mr. Zhao spoke of &quot;major defects&quot; in the political system. The party, he said, is too bureaucratic, overly centralized and &quot;feudal.&quot; He called for separating the party from the government, and offered some specific solutions. For example, he said, party committees around the country should stop placing members who don't hold government positions in charge of government operations.    Power in the party also should be decentralized, he said, to give cities, enterprises and institutions more authority.    The acting party chief also called for the establishment of a civil-service system based on merit. Under it, workers would fall into one of two classifications: Political civil servants would hold their jobs for specified periods, while professionals would gain permanent jobs by passing competitive exams.    Mr. Zhao's comments on political reform were &quot;surprisingly concrete,&quot; said an Asian diplomat in Beijing. &quot;The message to the nation is tremendous,&quot; he said. A West European diplomat was more cautious, however. &quot;It remains to be seen whether a party in power really has the political will to limit itelf,&quot; he said.    On economic affairs, Mr. Zhao stressed that China will continue to pursue reform and improve the climate for investors. He voiced support for several particularly controversial innovations, including issuing stocks and bonds to the public and permitting markets in real estate. Selling shares in government enterprises will continue &quot;on a trial basis,&quot; he said.    At the same time, he referred to several problems associated with the reforms, including inflation, corruption and widespread income disparities. He suggested that some aspects of the economy may actually become more tightly controlled. For example, he said the government will have to increase control over prices and rein in investment.    Mr. Zhao's detailed descriptions of problems in the national economy, which he has headed for seven years as premier, seemed aimed at least partly at preempting criticism from those who oppose aspects of the reform program. &quot;It will take a longer time to build the framework of the (reform) structure than we had estimated,&quot; he concluded.    And despite the trend toward reform, Mr. Zhao said state ownership will remain dominant in China's economy. &quot;The state regulates the market, and the market guides enterprises,&quot; he declared. Gradually, he said, the state will control the economy through indirect means, such as regulating the money supply.    To resolve the ideological problem of using capitalistic methods in a socialist state, Chinese planners have formulated a theory that says China is still in the &quot;primary stage&quot; of socialism. Mr. Zhao explained this notion at length yesterday, marking the first time reformers have attempted to create a comprehensive ideological underpinning for changes initiated by Mr. Deng.    When he finished his 34,000-word speech, the crowd of 2,000 delegates erupted in applause. Mr. Zhao looked at his watch, smiled, and walked off the podium with China's other leaders. </TEXT></DOC>
