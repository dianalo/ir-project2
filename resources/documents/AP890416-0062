Gerhard Roux also said two more guerrillas of the South-WestAfrica People's Organization, or SWAPO, had turned themselves in atU.N. assembly points. Altogether, only seven had arrived at theU.N. posts to be taken to SWAPO bases in neighboring Angola.   Roux is the spokesman for Louis Pienaar, the SouthAfrican-appointed administrator of Namibia, also known asSouth-West Africa.   April 1 was to have marked the beginning of Namibia's transitionto independence from South Africa, which has administered theterritory since World War II. But the transition was disrupted whenfighting broke out between the guerrillas and the territory'ssecurity forces.   According to an agreement reached a week ago between SouthAfrica, Cuba and Angola to end the fighting, the guerrillas are tohave safe passage to U.N. assembly points in northern Namibia.   U.N. and local officials have expressed doubt that theguerrillas would venture near the assembly points because of theconcentration of territorial police and soldiers in those areas.   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Sunday that any SWAPOguerrillas captured by the territorial security forces should beturned over immediately to U.N. forces in Namibia to oversee thetransition to independence.   Roux said there had been no decision on how to deal with the 28guerrillas captured by the security forces.   He said that since April 1, 278 guerrillas and 27 members of thesecurity forces have been killed.   Roux, in his report on Sunday's guerrilla deaths, said oneguerrilla was killed in a clash with territorial soldiers southeastof Swartbooisdrift. The second was tracked and killed by policenear Okandjera, he said.   He said the government forces suffered no casualties.   There was no independent confirmation of Roux's reports.Journalists are not permitted into the border areas, andauthorities have barred police and soldiers from talking withreporters.   SWAPO has been fighting against South African rule since 1966and is expected to get the most votes in elections scheduled forNovember.</TEXT></DOC>
