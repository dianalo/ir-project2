Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the on-site commander of the Alaska oilspill cleanup, ordered Exxon to provide immediately a detailedoperations schedule for areas outside Prince William Sound, alongthe fouled beaches southwest of Valdez that include the spectacularKatmai National Park wildlife refuge.   ``That should be submitted as soon as the shoreline committeefurnishes you an inventory of beaches requiring attention,''Robbins said in a letter to Exxon general manager Otto Harrison,the oil company's ranking executive in the spill zone.   He said it appeared doubtful that Exxon could meet its Sept. 15cleanup deadline. ``I am seriously concerned that the investment ofresources you describe will not be able to clean the 300-plus milesof shoreline in the time alloted,'' he told Harrison.   Exxon's proposed cleanup plan, submitted May 1, called forcleanup of 364 miles of shore by Sept. 15 and said it would seekexemptions from local environmental laws in order to dispose of therecovered oily waste.   ``I emphasize that the concept of the plan is sound,'' Robbinssaid. ``Please address these concerns I've presented immediatelyand incorporate them into your plan. Advise me as you do so.''   In Washington, Exxon USA President W.D. Stevens told a Senatecommittee that the company would deploy 1,600 more workers, plusmore barges and boats, bringing to 5,000 the total number ofcleanup workers involved in the shoreline cleanup.   Robbins, in a separate issue, said authorities were consideringthe possible use of chemical dispersants on beaches to break downthe oily sludge. ``That's going to be studied very carefully beforewe try it,'' Robbins said.   Environmentalists have attacked the use of dispersants,contending the chemicals pose a health risk.   Under federal law, the Coast Guard is responsible forsupervising the cleanup and must approve the company's strategy tohandle the more than 10 million gallons of crude oil dumped intoPrince William Sound when the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef 25miles from Valdez on March 24.   The oil has spread about 450 miles southwest of Valdez.   Robbins told Exxon to:   _Provide more personnel and equipment for the cleanup.   _Let the Coast Guard know what special equipment is needed sothe government could help find it.   _Place immediate importance on the cleanup outside PrinceWilliam Sound.   _Expect to have the cleanup reviewed by state and federalofficials next spring.   _Continue to have the use of the USS Juneau and USS McHenry ascommunications and support vessels.   _Give the Coast Guard each week a planning schedule that allowsfederal authorities to track the progress of the cleanup.   Robbins said he was speaking for Coast Guard Commandant Paul A.Yost Jr., who was in Washington, D.C. ``I have consulted thecommandant and he agrees with my letter,'' Robbins said.   In other spill-related developments Wednesday:   _State and federal officials reported that an estimated 600otters have been killed by the oil spill, along with severalthousand birds.   _Exxon launched an oil ``bounty hunter'' program, paying $5 agallon for recovered crude. The company said the bounty hunterswere private boat owners, using their own equipment and fuel, whoskimmed oil from Prince William Sound. There was no immediate wordof how much bounty oil had been recovered.   _A scientist with the state Department of EnvironmentalConservation, Pete McGee, said tests for hydrocarbons in the soundshowed that the water was apparently safe.   _Exxon ordered 60 mobile homes moved from Anchorage next monthto provide housing for oil company employees working on thecleanup. Exxon bought the units for $12,000 each, and they will beinstalled at a mobile home park by June 14, a day before Exxonemployees must vacate Valdez hotels to make way for summertourists. The company reportedly is spending $1.5 million to movethe units, outfit them with new furniture, televisions and dishes,and hire maids.   _A 50-foot landing craft involved in the cleanup sank nearValdez, but the three people aboard were rescued uninjured, theCoast Guard said. The vessel was under contract to Exxon and aninvestigation was under way, said Dave Haulbrook, a Coast Guardspokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
