In furtherance of this aim, this rulecontains provisions designed to facilitate travel, facilitate or reducethe work of affected agencies, and ensure that vital national interestsare protected. The Department of State concurs only in 8 CFR 212.1(i) ofthis rule.This rule adds a new Part 217 of 8 CFR, and amends existing Parts 212,214, 236, 242, 245, 248, and 299, to conform with new section 217 of theImmigration and Nationality Act (Act).Section 217.2 sets forth the eligibility criteria for individual participationin the program based on the provisions of section 217 of the Act and otherapplicable provisions of the Act.Section 217.3 provides the limits on eligibility for immigration benefitswhich are provided in the Act, but makes provision for a brief period ofsatisfactory departure under emergent circumstances and for readmissionto the United States after brief departures to foreign contiguous territory.Section 217.4(a) provides that persons who are excludable from the UnitedStates may not be admitted as Visa Waiver Pilot Program visitors regardlessof whether or not they have secured a waiver of grounds of excludabilityor consent to reapply for admission. It is consistent with the provisionsof section 217(a)(5) of the Act that persons who are known to be excludablebe required to secure a visa in order to apply for admission to the UnitedStates.Section 217.4(b) provides that applicants for admission under section 217of the Act who are found to be excludable from the United States or inadmissibleas visitors shall be excluded and removed from the United States withouta hearing before an immigration judge other than in connection with anapplication for asylum in the United States.Section 217.4(c) provides that aliens who have been admitted under Part217 who are found to be deportable from the United States shall be removedfrom the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge otherthan in connection with an application for asylum. Section 217.4 (b) and(c) implement section 217(b)(4) of the Act which requires that personswho wish to utilize the visa waiver provisions of section 217 of the Actmust waive their rights to normal procedures of inquiry, review, and appealregarding admissibility and deportability.Section 217.5 lists designated countries for the Visa Waiver Pilot Program.The United Kingdom has been designated as the initial Visa Waiver PilotProgram country in that it meets the criteria set forth in section 217(c)(2)of the Act, and in that it generates a significant portion of the totalnumber of nonimmigrant visitors to the Untied States. The selection ofthe United Kingdom as a Visa Waiver Pilot Program country is designed tomitigate the demand for nonimmigrant visas at United States consular facilitiesin Great Britain. For this reason, a distinction is made concerning variouscategories of British residents, nationals or citizens based on the Britishnationality laws. Citizens of British Commonwealth countries or Britishdependent territories are not eligible for the visa waiver. This rule providesthat only British citizens who have full and unrestricted permission toreside in the United Kingdom will be eligible to apply for admission asVisa Waiver Pilot Program applicants.Section 217.6 provides the criteria for carrier agreements under section217 of the Act. These criteria are based on the provisions of section 217(a)(4)and 217(d) of the Act.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner certifies that thisrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.This is not a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291.The information collection requirements contained in this regulation havebeen submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for clearance underthe Paperwork Reduction Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>8 CFR Parts 212, 214, 236, 242, 245, 248Administrative practice and procedures, Aliens, Passports and visas.8 CFR Part 217Administrative practice and procedures, Aliens, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Passports and visas.8 CFR Part 299Forms, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, Chapter I of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations isamended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 212_DOCUMENTARY REQUIREMENTS: NONIMMIGRANT; WAIVERS; ADMISSIONOF CERTAIN INADMISSIBLE ALIENS; PAROLE</ITAG>1.
