Still, the price of crude oil, which broke the $19-a-barrel levelthis month, remained well below $18 a barrel during the tradingsession, and some analysts said it appeared doubtful that priceswould return to those higher levels any time soon.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate _ the benchmark grade of U.S. crude _ rose 21cents to finish at $17.54 a barrel.   The contract had fallen $1.06 on Monday in what some analystscalled an expected ``correction'' following a recent strong rallyfueled by confidence in OPEC's production-cutting pact.   Among refined petroleum contracts traded on the exchange,February home heating oil settled 0.64 cent higher at 50.87 cents agallon, after losing 2.10 cents on Monday.   The February contract for unleaded gasoline, which declined 2.08cents in Monday's session, settled at 50.45 cents a gallon, up 1.03cents.   ``Right now the market is a little confused as to whetheryesterday's decline was the beginning of a sharp movement downwardor just a correction,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior analyst withE.D.andamp;F. Man International Futures Inc.   ``I think it was overdone, and I think (Tuesday) we just had arebound off yesterday,'' he said.   Chris McCormack, an energy analyst with Drexel Burnham LambertInc., agreed, but wasn't too bullish about the direction of pricesin the near future.   ``I think the market pretty much has discounted all the bullishnews,'' McCormack said. ``I don't think crude is sustainable at$19.''   Analysts note that since early October, West Texas Intermediatehad risen more than $7 on optimism that the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries would significantly cut its output tohelp shore up sagging worldwide prices.   A daily quota of 18.5 million barrels went into effect Jan. 1,and traders said there were indications that OPEC was sticking tothat level.   Analysts said traders were now turning their attention toThursday's scheduled meeting in London between OPEC and non-OPECnations.   ``I think the market feels that something positive could come outof that meeting,'' said McCormack.</TEXT></DOC>
