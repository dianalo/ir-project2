In a few moreyears, the growth in cellular mobile-phone companies &quot;will betremendous&quot; as the young industry strives to put a phone inevery pocket.</LP><TEXT>   Such enthusiasm has helped propel cellular stocks higherthis year. Falling interest rates are giving a breather tothe debt-laden companies, which were out of favor last yearas values for cellular franchises fell. But their recentshare-price gains have begun to make many investors nervous.   A number of big investors that bought the stocks cheaplyin 1990 suggest that investors might be wise to buy them atlower levels than today's. Skepticism also reigns at a numberof big brokerage firms that recently began covering thestocks.   Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. began following cellular stocks inlate April with &quot;sell&quot; recommendations on LIN Broadcasting,Cellular Communications, Contel Cellular and VanguardCellular Systems and &quot;hold&quot; opinions on McCaw CellularCommunications and Metro Mobile CTS Inc.   Prudential Securities began its coverage with a &quot;hold&quot;opinion on the group, citing the stocks' robust climb sincethey hit bottom in October. Analyst John Bauer, who saysinterest rates are the driving influence behind the stocks'move, doesn't expect the shares to go much higher this yearif interest rates stabilize.   Analyst Salvatore Muoio of Gabelli andamp; Co. also suggests thegroup is pricey. He recommended purchase of LIN Broadcastingin October when it was trading at about $43; it closed Fridayat 67 3/4. He liked McCaw Class A shares in October at $11each; they closed Friday at 24 3/8.   The Gabelli group long has favored &quot;hybrid&quot; cellularcompanies, or independent telephone companies with cellularinterests, such as C-Tec of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and LincolnTelecommunications of Lincoln, Neb.   &quot;We found we loved the telephone business as well,&quot; saysMr. Muoio, who adds that the companies can redeploy theirsteady stream of cash from telephone services to developtheir cellular franchises. As utility companies, however, thestocks generally trade at cheaper multiples than high-growthstocks and provide generous yields -- qualities favored bythe Gabelli group.   Cellular stocks could rise sharply if there's yet anotheracquisition in the shrinking group as regional telephonecompanies snare cellular interests, says Richard Frucci,manager of the $100 million Putnam Information Sciences Trustof Boston. Ameritech Corp., for example, has said it plans tobuy CyberTel Financial Corp. and its subsidiaries, whichprovide cellular service to Midwestern customers.   On the other hand, the group could meander if thecompanies become mired in regulatory battles over theallocation of federal airwaves for wireless communicationchannels, Mr. Frucci says. But he calls that a &quot;verylong-term&quot; possibility.   Also weighing on the group is uncertainty aboutprospective competition from the technology known as PersonalCommunications Networks; these use a different method toprovide wireless service. Although backers of PCN technologyinitially warned that cellular phones would be eclipsed by awave of lower-priced, pocket-sized gadgets, companies such asMcCaw now are laying the groundwork for participating in thatwave by upgrading systems to provide competing service.   In the meantime, Mr. Frucci expects his investments inCellular Communications, Metro Mobile, LIN (which is51.9%-owned by McCaw) and Vanguard to perform in line withthe market or slightly outperform it. If they rise another25% to 30%, he says he would reduce his holdings in theshares.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks were swept higher by alate-afternoon rally in economically sensitive stocks tradedon the major exchanges as investors bet on an economicrecovery.
