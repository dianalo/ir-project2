Fujitsu's U.S. unit, Fujitsu America Inc., will beginmarketing the company's VP2000 supercomputer line, primarilyto private industry, said Thomas Miller, vice president ofthe unit's supercomputer group. Amdahl Corp, a Fujitsuaffiliate, distributed the company's supercomputers in theU.S. until 1989, but sold only three machines.</LP><TEXT>   Fujitsu faces a tough battle against the incumbent Cray.The Eagan, Minn., company has sold 179 of the several hundredsupercomputers now installed in the U.S. Cray was the largestsupercomputer seller world-wide in 1991, with a 36.3% marketshare, according to Dataquest Inc., a market-research firm.By contrast, Fujitsu had a 5.6% market share.   Moreover, Fujitsu's biggest U.S. battles will probably bepolitical. Supercomputers &quot;are a political high ground forpeople who want to make a statement regarding U.S.-Japanesetrade,&quot; said Christopher Willard, a supercomputer analyst atDataquest. Fujitsu's potential customers can expect &quot;atremendous amount of political pressure&quot; to buy Americaninstead, he said.   Partly because of political backlash, Japanesesupercomputer makers have a surprisingly poor track record inthe U.S., despite the Japanese government's and industry'sheavy investments in supercomputing technology over the pastdecade, and despite U.S. alarmists' repeated warnings thatJapan poses an imminent challenge in the market. The threeFujitsu machines now in the U.S. were all sold by Amdahl,Sunnyvale, Calif., in 1986 and 1987 to the same customer, aDallas unit of a European company. Amdahl dropped the line in1989. Tokyo's NEC Corp., whose machines have gotten headlinesover the years for their technological merits, sold onemachine in the U.S. in 1985, to a group of Texasuniversities.   Still, Fujitsu is hoping to translate to the U.S. itssuccess in Europe, Australia and Japan, where it has sold atotal of 110 supercomputers. Fujitsu's Mr. Miller said thecompany won't focus on the public sector, which comprisesover 60% of the U.S. market but where political obstacles aregreatest. Instead, Fujitsu will concentrate on customers atcompanies that need supercomputers for tasks such as oilexploration or automobile design, he said.   The Japanese giant's big selling point will be its abilityto undercut Cray's prices, Mr. Miller said. &quot;We can get thejob done for 25% less than Cray,&quot; he said. &quot;We'd appeal to acustomer with a fixed budget because of economic strain.&quot;   A Cray spokesman said Fujitsu's machines, while cheaperthan Cray's, are a technological step behind. &quot;We're notgoing to get dragged into a price war,&quot; he added.</TEXT></DOC>
