GowenandM;New York, New YorkandM;Thank you for choosing PKZIP/PKUNZIP as one of the 33 best utilities.andP;  Thearticle mentions that the LHARC self-extractor is more compact than PKZIP'S,2K versus 10K, but the LHARC self-extractor has no features.andP;  The PKSFX typefiles support our Authenticity verification, password protection, extractinga file or a group of files, extracting files to other disk drives, printingthe files, etc.andP;  PKWARE does offer a stripped-down version of PKSFX: 2,934bytes, much smaller than the 10K reported in the article.andP;  This juniorversion of PKSFX is included with Version 1.1, which the article mentions isthe version reviewed.andP;  The picture of PKZIP used for the article is Version1.01, not Version 1.1.andM;We plan to release a menu-driven program that has all the features ofPKUNZIP.andP;  We also have a program that compresses .EXE or .COM files smallerbut still allows them to execute.andP;  Typical compression is 40 to 50 percent.andO;We showed the beta versions of these programs at Spring Comdex and got ravereviews.andM;Douglas HayandM;Software DeveloperandM;PKWARE Inc.andM;Glendale, WisconsinandM;I was very surprised that you did not include Headroom by Helix Software(Version 2.02b) in your article about the 33 most indispensable DOSutilities.andP;  In terms of compatibility, ease of use, and usefulness, nothingelse matches it.andP;  Without it, I struggled with a variety of alternativeconfigurations for all my different applications.andP;  It works perfectly withall my TSRs to overcome MS-DOS's 640K memory limit.andM;Before I used it, I had no single configuration that did everything I wantedto do and was forced to reboot, mark, and release TSRs in a very cumbersomeway.andP;  Please let others know what a great product it is.andM;Joel B. SingerandM;East Hills, New YorkandM;SOFTWARE UP IN FLAMESandM;This is in regard to Bill Machrone's July 1990column.andP;  In the early 1980s, Imet with a vice president of a company that might be called the Lotus of itstime.andP;  (The company, of course, is long dead.)andM;The vice president told me, quite seriously, &quot;If you wrap your Chevroletaround a tree you wouldn't expect General Motors to buy you a new one.andP;  Whyshould you expect me to send you a new disk if it's destroyed in a fire or ifyou spill coffee on it?&quot; (The company's major business product was, ofcourse, copy protected.)andM;It seems that industry attitudes haven't changed much.andM;Barry D. BayerandM;Homewood, IllinoisandM;COMPUTING FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIREDandM;I am writing concerning an article in the First Looks section (June 26,1990).andO;While well intentioned, the article was misleading and uninformed.andP;  ThePremier 210 does offer some interesting features, namely the ability torepeat error messages using speech, and the ability to read text files, butthese features in and of themselves do not make a computer usable by blindpersons.andP;  Just repeating error messages or voicing files sent to the speechsystem is like having a limited audio printer.andP;  It would not make it possiblefor a blind person to interact in real time with a computer or applicationprogram.andP;  Once the voiced data has gone by, it's gone.andP;  Such features areprovided by memory-resident programs called screen review programs.andP;  One suchprogram is Provox, which my company, Kansys, writes and sells.andM;According to the National Federation of the Blind-a 50,000-member nationwideorganization of blind persons-the unemployment and underemployment rate forblind persons in this country is over 70 percent.andM;As a leading source of information about computers, you can do much to helpdispel the myths and misconceptions that prevent blind persons from achievingwidespread employment.andP;  Blind computer users could also benefit from havingaccess to your magazine in a computer readable form, such as in text files,on-disk.andM;The National Federation of the Blind operates a program in conjunction withthe U.S.andP;  Department of Labor called Job Opportunities for the Blind (JOB).andO;Contact them at (800) 638-7518.andM;David AndrewsandM;Vice PresidentandM;Sales and MarketingandM;Kansys Inc.andM;Albuquerque, New MexicoandM;PC The full text of PC Magazine is available on-line and on CD-ROMs throughComputer Library, a database of articles from over 135 computer-relatedpublications.andP;  For more information, call (212) 503-4400.-EdandM;MISSING A FLOPPY?andM;In your First Looks article on Sharp's new PC-6220 (June 12,1990) you draw acomparison with the Toshiba T1200XE.andP;  &quot;Like the UltraLite and the largerToshiba T1000XE and T1200XE, the PC-6220 sacrifices the convenience of afloppy drive .andP;  .  .  .&quot;andM;This caused me some concern; however, I quickly pulled out my T1200XE and wasrelieved to find that the floppy drive was still intact.andM;Matthew A. MillerandM;Somerdale, New JerseyandM;Whoops! We were half right.andP;  The Toshiba T1000XE does not have a floppy diskdrive, but the T1200XE does.-Ed.andM;WON OVER BY WINDOWSandM;I have long disliked the GUI interface because of its hardware overhead.andP;  itseemed to be providing something that wasn't needed.andP;  Recently, I set out topurchase a multitasking environment for my 386 machine and was expecting topurchase a copy of DESQview and QEMM.andM;The helpful salesman at the discount software store called my attention toWindows 3.0 which had come out the week before and hadn't yet been reviewedin PC Magazine.andP;  I told him I was leery but he offered to take Windows backif I didn't like it.andP;  He pointed out its memory management capabilities, itsability to run even old DOS programs in 386 mode, and said it would make memore productive.andP;  He was right on all counts and I haven't taken it back.andM;But one problem: it is such a rich environment and so new to an old DOSveteran like me that it's hard for me to get my regular PC work done.andP;  I'mtoo busy exploring and learning Windows 3.0.andP;  It's a great product andMicrosoft has finally got it almost perfect.andM;Robert HarmonandM;Evanston, IllinoisandM;FAITHFUL REPRODUCTIONandM;Your recent First Looks article (July 1990) introducing the Monotype TypefaceLibrary included a misconception about Adobe's practices in reproducingPostScript fonts.andM;The article implies that the designs of our characters are modified toaccommodate low-resolution printing.andP;  We would like to emphasize that it isnot Adobe's policy to alter the character shapes of licensed typefacedesigns.andM;Before a new typeface package is released, our typographic staffpainstakingly examines each character to make sure it is reproducedfaithfully to the original design and that it will be rendered efficientlyand optimally at all sizes and resolutions.andM;As Adobe cross-licenses Monotype designs in our own library, we anticipatethat both companies will ship identical software.andP;  Any necessary&quot;adjustments&quot; will be the result of both companies' commitment to quality andto faithful electronic or digital reproduction of historical designs.andM;Kathy EnglarandM;Product Marketing Manager, FontsandM;Adobe SystemsandM;Montain View, CaliforniaandM;SOFTWARE SLOPandM;I had to comment after reading John C. Dvorak's article on &quot;The Software SlopFactor&quot; (June 12, 1990).andP;  1 am a poor software developer who, like most, isat the mercy of the big firms that develop the products I use.andP;  In the pastfew months, upgrades of popular software packages have been so riddled withbugs that my applications no longer worked correctly.andP;  I think that Americais experiencing a real quality crisis in software.andP;  New features and updatestake precedence over making things work right.andM;The big companies cannot be trusted.andP;  Software developers need a lab similarto Consumer Reports.andP;  The products are tested by qualified personnel, and ifno bugs are found, the company is given a certification number for use intheir ads.andP;  Unless the certification is included, developers can be certainthat the product is just a beta-test version.andM;If software can't do what it promises, it shouldn't be sold.andP;  if this type ofcheap throw-it-together-and-hope-the-stupid-users-don't-find-the-bugsmentality continues, I want out of the business !andP;  John FlemingandM;Oak Forest, illinoisandM;READING ISN'T FUNDAMENTALandM;Having just received my PC Magazine utility disks in the mail, I decided tosit down and try out a few of the programs.andP;  To test PARSE (a program thatanalyzes the grade level of text) I created a file containing, &quot;See the cat.andO;See the cat run.andP;  Run cat, run.&quot; PARSE responded with a reading grade levelof 5.3.andP;  That didn't seem right.andP;  Then a really frightening thought occurredto me ....andM;Paul D. CohenandM;Huntington Station, New YorkandM;MONITORING THE COSTSandM;Here is one for the &quot;what's wrong with this picture&quot; category:andM;If I had the money, I could buy:andM;* A fast 80MB hard drive, with controller, for about $599.andM;* A name-brand 300-dot-per-inch laser printer for about $995.andM;* A custom-built 386SX with hard drive for about $1,200.andM;But, if I wanted to buy a nice 20-inch color monitor, I would have to payabout $3,000.andM;So how about it NEC, Sony, Mitsubishi, Panasonic, and all the rest of youguys, let's get your best 20-inch monitors down to about $899.andP;  (You couldprobably sell a million.)andM;Douglas L. ReedandM;Jacksonville, FloridaandM;ARTS AND CRAFTSandM;Everyone's comments on Bill Machrone's March 13, 1990, column missed theboat.andP;  There's no doubt Bill is a doting father to his eight-year-olddaughter.andP;  In the course of helping her with a cover design for her classstories, he employed a litany of high-end graphics.andM;In the process, he also helped stifle any creativity this project might haveinduced.andP;  Bill, however, is only a coconspirator.andP;  The teacher who suggestedcomputer production should be brought to her school art room and informedthat pencil, paint, and charcoal are instruments of art, not the mouse, 386,and laser printer.andM;But don't worry, Bill.andP;  When you're in your rocking chair, you won't have tolook at your daughter's hand-drawn art work.andP;  For memories, you'll have clipart.andM;Brad BrushandM;Vancouver, British ColumbiaandM;Canada</TEXT></DOC>
