(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush andcongressional leaders resumed budget talks Friday as lawmakers saidforeign payments for U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf would easesome _ but not all _ pressure on the deficit.   After a five-week break for Congress' summer vacation,negotiators returned to work in the main bar of the base Officers'Club, 10 miles from the capitol.   Their goal was to finish by Monday a $50 billion package of taxboosts and spending cuts for next year and $500 billion in savingsover the next five years. Reporters were confined to anotherbuilding on the base about two miles away in an effort to reduceinterruptions.   Democrats and Republicans swapped plans Friday afternoon as thebargaining began, said officials who asked to not be identified.   The administration proposal calls for $52.5 billion in savingsnext year and $513.2 billion over the next five years, one officialsaid. It is similar to the budget Bush proposed in January, and toa July administration plan never formally released but revealed byGOP bargainers.   The proposal calls for $4 billion in defense cuts and $15.5billion in reductions in benefit programs, including Medicare.   It seeks $20.4 billion in new taxes, including levies on alcoholand limits on the deduction allowed for state and local incometaxes. It also calls for a cut in the capital gains tax rate, whichBush says would raise money by encouraging the sale of real estateand other property.   Fewer details of the Democratic proposal were known. An officialsaid it relied heavily on defense cuts and taxes, including levieson energy. The plan took no account of the costs of U.S. militaryoperations in the Persian Gulf, the official said.   Democrats have argued that the costs of Operation Desert Shieldare similar to a one-time emergency and should not be counted inthe government's long-range budgeting.   Unless lawmakers and the administration enact a deal by Oct. 1,the Gramm-Rudman law will impose about $100 billion in cuts to mostdefense and domestic programs. Most participants on both sides sayslashes of that amount would be so harsh that they could not beallowed to stand very long.   Bargainers want to finish their work at Andrews by Monday togive Congress a chance to write the plan into law.   As the talks began, bargainers reaffirmed their goal of slicing$50 billion off of next year's federal deficit.   ``Nothing has happened anywhere that makes me less interested ingetting this budget deficit under control once and for all,'' Bushtold reporters as he arrived at the base for a 30-minute visit tothe talks.   ``If we needed a budget agreement five weeks ago, we need onemore today,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.   Since the talks recessed in late July, the economy has shownsigns of weakening and Iraq and the United States have faced off inwhat may be a long-term standoff in the Persian Gulf.   Legislators welcomed the news that Saudi Arabia, the exiledgovernment of Kuwait, Japan and South Korea would be paying theUnited States billions of dollars to defray the costs of Americanforces in the Middle East.   ``It helps out a little,'' said Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass.   But with U.S. military expenses in the gulf expected to runabout $1 billion per month _ barring large-scale fighting _ Conteand others cautioned that there was no reason to expect that theforeign help would put a major dent in the federal deficit.   The administration has estimated that unless some savings arefound, next year's deficit would be a record $250 billion. Fiscal1991 begins Oct. 1.   Republicans have been optimistic that because of theconfrontation with Iraq, cuts to the $290 billion defense budgetwill be limited.   ``I think we'll have an orderly defense build-down now,'' saidSen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``I think we're not going to have thedefense meltdown some people thought.''   Democrats have sought defense cuts more in the $9 billion to $16billion range.   Other important differences remained between Democrats andRepublicans.   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said Republicans were hoping for apackage that would rely slightly more on spending cuts than on taxincreases in the first year. Democrats want the two components tobe equal in size.   Domenici, Gramm and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. _all from energy-producing states _ said they wanted a plan thatencouraged energy production with enticements such as tax credits.   Democrats said they want a package that encourages the UnitedStates to move toward energy independence, with some officialssaying privately that they have discussed some sort of new taxes onenergy.   ``Big differences remain,'' Bush said. ``It's going to takecompromise.''</TEXT></DOC>
