The increase of floorarea rose to 4% level in 1986 from 2% in previous years. The floor areaof offices has rapidly increased in the Tokyo metropolitan area, andwill grow at an annual rate of 2.6% in the long term. The power consumptionper floor area was reduced at a rate of 1% per year due to the promotionof energy conservation for the air conditioning and hot water supply,and leveled in 1982 and thereafter because of the increased power consumptionfor the office automation, and the air conditioning with heat pump andgas. Slight increase is forecasted for the future. The energy demandsfor business will increase at a rate of 3.9% by 2000. Demands for theelectric power and urban gas will steadily increase at rates of 4.7%and 5.1%, respectively. Demands for oil will be as low as 2%. The increasein large urban areas will be fairly high or 4.2%. (2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
