<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-89-0910 </DOCNO><TEXT>Because of public health concerns over the potential adverse health effectsof diesel emissions, a series of comprehensive animal studies were aimedin the early 1980s at the question of whether long-term exposure to dieselemissions can result in an increased incidence of lung tumors in laboratoryanimals. Multiple confounding factors limit the evidence for chemicalcarcinogenicity in these inhalation experiments. First, tumors were foundin only one animal species (laboratory rat), and some inhalation exposuresresulted in negative findings even in this species. Second, the tumorsoccurred primarily in aged animals where the spontaneous incidence isincreased, were different from those observed in cigarette-smoking humans,and varied in their characteristics from benign bronchioloalveolar adenomasup to the squamous-cell type. Third, the tumors were produced only whenanimals were exposed to high concentrations of particles and are suggestiveof a non-specific reaction to an excessive burden of particulate matter.It is well known that high concentrations of inhaled dust aerosols impairpulmonary clearance mechanisms and result in unusually large particledeposits in the lung that stimulate cell division and atypical cell formation.This paper compares the exposure conditions and the estimated dose ofinhaled diesel particles with the observed tumor yields in individualstudies. The purpose for the comparative analysis is to answer the questionof whether the data indicate a real carcinogenic potential of particle-associatedchemicals or whether the response is mediated by other tumor-producingmechanisms. Differentiating between these two pathways is important forthe extrapolation of animal data to humans and for the proper assessmentof public health risk.</TEXT></DOC>
