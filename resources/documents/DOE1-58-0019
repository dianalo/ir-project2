Before proceeding with the conceptual designand sizing of the cogeneration plant, a walk-through energy audit wasconducted to determine the Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) that mightbe appropriate in reducing the electrical demand of the present facility.This report recommends three major ECMs that will reduce the electricaldemand by an estimated 600 kW. These are listed as follows: lightingsystem modifications; refrigeration system modifications; and compressedair system modifications. This paper describes the walk-through energyaudit and its recommendations; the cogeneration feasibility study includinglegal and regulatory considerations; equipment selection; and plant design.</TEXT></DOC>
