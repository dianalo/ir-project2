Shipments to a Dutch company, Delft Instruments N.V., werehalted in January, two months after the supplier, HughesAircraft Co. of Los Angeles, learned of an investigation bythe Pentagon's Defense Technology Security Agency, said aspokesman for Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp.</LP><TEXT>   The spokesman said the company was &quot;kind of hoodwinked.&quot;   A U.S. official familiar with the case said a&quot;considerable amount of night vision equipment&quot; was shippedto Iraq through a Delft subsidiary in Belgium as well asthrough other sources.   &quot;We also know some of that equipment had a U.S. origin,&quot;the official said.   The U.S. has suspended all munitions export licensesbetween American suppliers and Delft Instruments, accordingto U.S. officials. Those licenses forbid transfer to a thirdparty.   U.S. commanders have said the sophisticated night visionequipment of the allies provides a big advantage over Iraqitroops. Iraq's night battles at the Saudi Arabia town ofKhafji, the first major ground encounter of the Persian Gulfwar, surprised the allies. &quot;Delft equipment was picked up atKhafji,&quot; the U.S. official said.   Neither the Hughes spokesman nor Rinze Kingma, presidentof Delft Instruments, would provide details of the contractbetween Hughes and Delft. The Delft official said the companyhad done nothing wrong, adding, &quot;We always obey the exportlicense policies of our government.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
