Background</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">II. Current Actions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">III. Request for Comments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>To fulfill its responsibilities under the Federal Energy AdministrationAct of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-275) and the Department of Energy OrganizationAct (Pub. L. 95-91), the EIA is obliged to published, and otherwise makeavailable to the public, high-quality statistical data that, as accuratelyas possible, reflect national and regional electric power supply and demandactivity. To meet this responsibility, as well as internal DOE requirementsthat are dependent on accurate data, the EIA conducts statistical surveysthat encompass every major electric power supply and demand activity inthe United States. The Form EIA-714 collects information on system netgeneration, energy requirements, peak load, energy transfers, summer andwinter peak load and energy forecasts, high voltage line data, and transmissionmaps.The EIA sponsors 3 percent of this data collection effort, which is sponsored97 percent by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The EIA uses thedata to provide the DOE and others with timely electric system data tofacilitate analyses of electric power system reliability and adequacy;to prepare status reports on the electric utility industry; to monitorelectric utility forecasts of loads and plans for expansion; and to obtaina comprehensive picture of energy generation transfers and load distribution.The information collected for the Commission is mandated by the FederalPower Act, which requires the Commission to analyze power system operationin the course of its regulatory functions which include general electricpower and other licensing provisions; interconnection and coordinationof facilities; disposition on property, etc. (merger provisions); rateand charges; furnishing of adequate service; and interconnection and wheeling.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Current Actions</ITAG>In keeping with its mandated responsibilities, the EIA proposes that theOffice of Management and Budget clear for 3 years the electric power datacollection Form EIA-714. The EIA and the Commission are proposing the followingchanges for the Form EIA-714: (1) Replace the reporting of the net capabilityconnected to load, net capability not connected to load, and integratednet demand on prime mover by plant at the time of the system peak withintegrated net demand on each plant at the hour of the system peak; (2)report line load or load flow simulations reasonably representing systemconditions for the summer and winter peak load periods only, eliminatingthe reporting of an off-peak period; (3) increase the threshold for thevoltage levels that determine which transmission lines must be reported;and (4) permit substitution of existing general maps and single-line schematicdiagrams used by the respondent instead of requiring new system maps anddiagrams. Additional minor changes to the form have been made and instructionshave been clarified to assist the respondent in completing the form.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Request for Comments</ITAG>Prospective respondents and other interested parties should comment onthe proposed form within 30 days of the publication of this notice. Thefollowing guidelines are provided to assist in the preparation of responses.As a potential respondent:A. Are the instructions and definitions clear and sufficient? If not, whatinstructions require clarification?B. Can the data be submitted using the definitions included in the instructions?C. Can data be submitted in accordance with the response time specifiedin the instructions?D. How many hours, including time for preparation and administrative review,will you require to complete and submit the form?E. What is the estimated cost of completing this form, including the directand indirect costs associated with the data collection? Direct cost shouldinclude all costs, such as administrative costs, directly attributableto providing this information.F. How can the form be improved?G. Do you know of other Federal, State, or local agencies that collectsimilar data? If you do, specify the agency, the data elements, and themeans of collection.As a potential user:A. Can you use data at the levels of detail indicated on the form?B. For what purposes would you use the data? Be specific.C. How could the form be improved to better meet your specific needs?D. Are there alternate sources of data and do you use them? What are theirdeficiencies and/or strengths?The EIA is also interested in receiving comments from persons regardingtheir views on the need for the collection of the information containedin this survey.Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and/orincluded in the requests for OMB approval of this survey; they also willbecome a matter of public record.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Authority</ITAG>Sections 5 (a) and (b), 13 (a) and (b), and 52 of Pub.
