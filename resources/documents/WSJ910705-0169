Most programs that run on today's personal computersaren't very smart. Even if they all run on the same PC, theyusually can't swap information. And even if they can swapinformation, it never does much good: A graph that has beentransferred from a spreadsheet into a word-processing programis simply a dumb picture -- it doesn't know that it shouldupdate itself when the spreadsheet is changed.</LP><TEXT>   What's more, unskilled computer users can't make theirsoftware do exactly what they want it to do. They can eitherdo exactly what a big software company wants them to do, orthey can learn how to program the computer themselves.   For some time now, computer experts have been promoting anew kind of software -- &quot;object-oriented&quot; software, firstproposed in the 1970s by researchers at Xerox Corp.'s famousPalo Alto Research Center. The agreement struck Wednesdaybetween International Business Machines Corp. and AppleComputer Inc. is the biggest endorsement yet of thisapproach.   In contrast to today's programs, which try to be allthings to all people, object-oriented software is modular.The modules can easily be combined in many different ways,much like a child's Lego blocks. That means users can buildtheir own customized software, and software developers cancreate new programs more easily.   Object-oriented software deals with data by parceling itinto little chunks called &quot;objects,&quot; which are smart enoughto know what the user would like them to do. A word-processednote might be an object, for example, and could berepresented by a little picture of a note on a computerscreen. To print the note, a user would simply use amouse-pointing device to drag the little picture onto thepicture of a printer. The software would do the rest -- evenif the printer was in a different building, and didn't speakthe exact same language as the word processor.   The user might then transfer the note to the computer of acolleague halfway around the world, just by dragging it ontoa little picture of his colleague's machine. If he wanted tomake a minor change later, he might update the note on hisown machine and it would automatically update on hiscolleague's machine, too.   Such easy-to-use technology is slowly arriving, but a lotof work still needs to be done. IBM and Apple say their jointeffort to produce object-oriented software should startbearing fruit in three years or so.</TEXT></DOC>
