 If a company is found to be non-responsible, thegovernment can also disqualify it from receiving a contract.andP;  The governmentcan impose either penalty because a company lacks integrity, so the twocategories overlap.andM;However, there are differences between debarment and responsibilitydeteminations.andP;  Because of constitutional requirements for due process, acompany cannot be debarred without first being notified of the chargesagainst it and being given an opportunity to rebut them.andP;  A decision to debara company also must be supported by sufficient information.andM;None of these protections apply to an agency's decision not to award acontract because it considers a company non-responsible.andP;  Although acontracting officer may discuss adverse information with a bidder, he or sheis not obliged to do so by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.105-3.andP;  Andthe burden of demonstrating responsibility rets with the contractor.andM;FAR 9.103 requires contracting officers to find a prospective contractornon-responsible unless there are clear indications to the contrary.andP;  Thus,any doubt hurts the contractor.andM;At first blush, the two categories seem different enough -- debarment is ablanket ineligibility and non-responsibility refers only to a specificcontract.andP;  However, there is no real distinction between a debarment and aseries of responsibility determinations based on a perceived lack ofintegrity.andM;One celebrated case shows that repeated findings that a company lacksresponsibility are the same as a debarment, at least for the purpose ofinvoking the due process protections of the Constitution.andM;A harder question is posed when a company is once found non-responsible ongrounds that can be invoked again.andP;  A decision that a company lacks integritywould seem to fall into this category.andP;  All else being equal, today'suntrustworthy contractor is also tomorrow's.andP;  If so, then at what point doesdue process apply?andP;  It is a question reminiscent of the old paradox: How manyhairs make a beard?andM;Several recent decisions grapple with this question.andP;  One is a bid protestdecision of the General Accounting Office named Energy Management Corp.,andO;B-234727, July 12, 1989, 89-2 CPD 1/2 38.andM;In a sealed bid procurement, the Army Corps of Engineers refused to award acontract to the low bidder.andP;  The company's president was under investigationfor theft, product substitution and fraud, in connection with a priorgovernment contract.andP;  The corps refused to share with the bidder thederogatory information the Army had compiled in its investigation.andM;The rejected bidder protested to GAO.andP;  The company claimed that it was beingdebarred without due process of law.andM;GAO examined the court decisions cited by the protester and concluded thatthey all applied to &quot;more than one procurement.&quot;andP;  Because the low bidder wasonly denied a single contract, GAO concluded it was entitled to no dueprocess rights.andP;  The protest was denied.andM;The GAO and General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals haveheld that denial of a single contract -- even for reasons of integrity --does not rise to constitutional dimensions.andM;Chapters of StoryandM;Two more chapters in this story come from decisions of the U.S.andP;  DistrictCourt for the District of Columbia.andP;  One such decision is titled Cubic Corp.andO;vs.andP;  Cheney.andP;  That case involved the fallout of the fabled &quot;Ill Wind&quot;investigation.andM;Cubic was a client of one of the consultants implicated in improperactivities.andP;  When unsealed affidavits in the criminal proceedings mentionedCubic and its president, the Air Force held Cubic non-responsible and deniedit a contract award.andP;  The agency seemed to be concerned that theinvestigation would touch the contract.andM;In this case, however, the contracting officer told Cubic the reasons it wasfound non-responsible and gave the company a chance to respond while the AirForce reconsidered its determination.andM;In reviewing the Air Force's actions, the court said the &quot;denial of agovernment contract on the basis that the prospective contractor lacksintegrity deprives that contractor of a liberty interest within the meaningof the due process clause&quot; of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.andP;  Thecourt did not distinguish between the denial of one contract or several.andM;However, the court held that the Air Force had no infringed Cubic's rights.andO;Under the circumstances, Cubic had had an adequate notice of the reasons forthe adverse action and a sufficient opportunity to be heard.andM;Cubic also claimed that the non-responsibility determination was tantamountto a suspension, and it asserted it was entitled to  more stringent dueprocess protections than it had received.andP;  The court disagreed, noting thatCubic had received a contract from another Air Force office while its casewas pending.andM;Cubic has appealed this decision.andM;Finally, another recent decisions of the same court on debarment issues isLeslie and Elliott Co. vs.andP;  Garrett.andP;  That case concerned two contemporaneousfindings of non-responsibility that were not tied directly to a finding oflack of integrity.andM;The contractor was accused of submitting numerous claims for increased costs,writing too many letters to the agency, having unsatisfactory performanceratings on several contracts, and bidding low on contracts and laterexploiting &quot;obscure flaws&quot; in the specifications.andM;Based upon a record that showed that the agency was eager not to award anymore contracts to this company, the court held that the agency had, ineffect, debarred the company.andP;  The court ordered the agency to conduct aproper debarment hearing, with due process protections.andM;Perhaps the lesson of this case is that the number of non-responsibilitydecisions matters less than their being rooted in a common set of findingsthat apply beyond the contracts in question.andM;Joseph J.
