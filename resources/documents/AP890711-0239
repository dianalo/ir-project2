The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 55.7points, or 2.5 percent, higher at 2,250.9.   Earlier in the afternoon, the closely watched index hit apost-crash high of 2,260.8. At its lowest, prior to the bid for BAT,the index was down 7.5 points at 2,187.7.   Volume totaled 639.3 million shares, up sharply from 417.6million Monday.   The bid by an investor group including Anglo-French financier SirJames Goldsmith, British financier Jacob Rothschild and Australia'sKerry Packer was quickly rejected by BAT which said it was of``dubious value.''   Nonetheless, it inspired the market.   ``The BAT bid was very important,'' said Kenneth Inglis, equitystrategist at UBS Phillips and Drew. ``We're likely to see similartakeover attempts in the near future.''   The market's leap forward prompted many equity analysts at Londonbrokerages to forecast further robust gains in the market during thethird quarter. Continuing takeover speculation, high institutionalliquidity, and a lack of selling pressure are seen leading themarket higher in the near term.   The market received additional upward impetus from a robustshowing on Wall Street. At the London close, the Dow JonesIndustrial Average was up 17.64 points at 2,520.30 points.   ``Today's bid now suggests that no U.K. company is immune from apotential takeover,'' one equity trader noted.   If successful, a BAT takeover would put British takeovers intothe big league, nearing last year's $25 billion buyout of RJRNabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the largest companypurchase ever.</TEXT></DOC>
