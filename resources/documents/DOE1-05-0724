The evaluations are based on analysis of experimental dataand results of model calculations which reproduce the experimental data.Evaluated data are given for neutron-induced reaction cross sections,angular and energy distributions, and for gamma-ray production crosssections associated with the reactions. File 6 formats are used to representenergy-angle correlated data and recoil spectra. Uncertainty files areincluded for the major cross sections. Full evaluations are given for/sup 63,65/Cu.</TEXT></DOC>
