Fearful that a Mideast war would knock share prices lower,investors backed away from stock mutual funds just before thePersian Gulf war broke out. But when the market defied thepundits and surged upward, fund investors reversed course andclambered back into stocks.</LP><TEXT>   Investors began retreating from stock funds in December,when inflows dwindled to just $184 million, according tonumbers released yesterday by the Investment CompanyInstitute. And fund company officials say that mutual fundinvestors sold stock funds heavily during the first two weeksof January.   &quot;People had a real doomsday scenario,&quot; says Robert Leo,director of mutual funds at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.&quot;The worst-case scenario didn't happen, and the gloom haslifted. There was no place for the market to go but up.&quot;   Rather than falling, stock prices rose sharply on Jan. 17,the day after the U.S. began its air attacks against Iraq.Fund groups such as Janus Group, T. Rowe Price Associates andShearson say that investors have been scrambling to get intostock funds ever since.   December's net inflow of just $184 million marked a sharpslowdown from November, when stock funds pulled in $1.3billion. (These numbers include stock fund sales lessredemption, plus the net effect of switches between stockfunds and other funds in the same fund group. Reinvesteddividends are excluded.)   Despite the recent rush of cash into stock funds, it looksas if January will be another poor month for stock fundsales. Janus, Invesco, Oppenheimer Management Corp., T. RowePrice, Shearson and Vanguard Group say their stock fundspulled in more money than they surrendered to departingshareholders, but in many cases the amount involved wasmodest. Massachusetts Financial Services and New EnglandSecurities say their stock funds suffered small net outflows.   While mutual fund investors were turning more bearishduring December, fund managers were getting more aggressive.The amount of cash held by stock funds dropped from 12.4% ofassets in November to 11.4% in December. December's cashlevel is the lowest since July 1990.   According to fund groups, international stock funds werethe biggest gainers during investors' stock-fund buying bingeof the past two weeks. But there also are signs that smallcompany stock funds, and especially technology funds, arestarting to garner investor attention.   T. Rowe Price says its flagship small company stock fund,New Horizons, has had a surge of new money in the past fewdays. At Denver's Invesco Funds Group, the biggest moneymagnets in January included its technology sector fund andits emerging growth fund.   &quot;Beginning on Jan. 17, we've seen an extremely heavy surgeinto our stock funds,&quot; says Gavin Quill, a marketing researchanalyst with Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark. He says that ScudderDevelopment Fund, the fund group's small company stock fund,has recently been attracting 50% of all the new money goinginto stock funds. &quot;In the last week and a half, we've seenthe heaviest sales ever for our Development Fund,&quot; says Mr.Quill.   Among bond funds, municipals continued to pull in largeamounts of new money during January. Government bond funds,including those that own Government National MortgageAssociation bonds, also saw a pickup in sales. But fundgroups say high-yielding junk bond funds, which lost anadditional $578 million in December, continued to sufferheavy redemptions during January.   The biggest winner of all in January was undoubtedly moneymarket funds. According to the Investment Company Institute,money fund assets jumped to $449.6 billion from $422 billionduring the first three weeks of January. But most of thatsurge occurred before fighting began in the Mideast, and fundgroups say that in recent days some of that money has beenswitched into stock funds.</TEXT></DOC>
