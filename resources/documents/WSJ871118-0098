Early offerings include an investment that combines gold coins and zero-coupon Treasury securities and another that consists of a portfolio of small, high-yield utility stocks that may be ripe for takeovers. Brokerage executives say they are preparing additional new offerings for registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    The new investment vehicles are part of an overall brokerage-house strategy of advising investors to move to defensive, yield-oriented stocks and to &quot;flee to quality.&quot; They also provide an opportunity for brokers to retain nervous clients.    Says Norman I. Schvey, a managing director of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., &quot;Anyone with money in his pocket is a little bit scared right now.&quot;    Brokerage firms have taken a similar, defensive approach in the past during bear markets and recessions, when individual investors' ardor for stocks cooled. Between 1979 and 1981, for instance, when high interest rates made stocks less appealing, Merrill Lynch sold about $15.5 billion of an investment that consisted of portfolios of bank certificates of deposit.    But the new defensive approaches draw mixed reviews from some money managers and investment advisers. &quot;Many of these strategies are aimed at not losing your money, but they're also not taking advantage of opportunities in the post-crash market,&quot; says Larry Biehl, a partner in Bailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., money-management firm. &quot;This is not a time to sit on your hands.&quot;    Mr. Biehl adds that the brokerages' strategies have a dual purpose: &quot;They are also defending against money flowing out of brokerage-house accounts.&quot;    Roger C. Gibson, a money manager with Allegheny Financial Group Ltd., in Pittsburgh, says the new investments are &quot;ad hoc, short-term responses to the market,&quot; instead of rational building blocks for a long-term portfolio of investments.    Brokerage executives say they are providing the new investment mechanisms for people still nervous about the market, who think the worst may still be to come. &quot;Our purpose isn't to tell clients to buy gold now,&quot; says Merrill Lynch's Mr. Schvey. &quot;We're saying that for someone who wants to buy gold, here is what we think is the best possible way to do it.&quot;    Several new offerings are unit investment trusts, which give investors an interest in a portfolio of assets that usually doesn't change throughout the life of the trust.    Both Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter Financial Services Group, a division of Sears Roebuck andamp; Co., have introduced unit trusts that combine gold and Treasury securities. &quot;We're offering the trust as a means for investors to conveniently own gold and preserve their capital,&quot; says John Van Heuvelen, a first vice president at Dean Witter. &quot;It's an inflation hedge and a diversification vehicle.&quot;    The trusts invest half in American Eagle gold coins and half zero-coupon Treasury securities that mature in eight and a half or nine years. The zero-coupon securities don't pay periodic interest. But when the trust matures -- even if the price of gold declines significantly -- investors should get back at least their initial investments with the coins as a bonus, Mr. Schvey says.    Minimum investment for individual investors is $1,000. The brokerage houses buy the gold coins and store them in vaults, but if investors want to hold their own coins, the brokers will mail them. Sales charges are 3.5% at Merrill Lynch and 4.7% at Dean Witter.    The gold coins provide a hedge against inflation, Mr. Biehl says, while the Treasuries are a hedge against recession or depression. &quot;The real question is what happens if neither extreme occurs,&quot; he says. &quot;It will mean that the investment will languish with a likely 4% to 5% yield, the equivalent of a savings account.&quot;    On Oct. 20, the day after the crash, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., an American Express Co. unit, launched its Utility Value unit investment trust -- a collection of 60 small-to-medium-sized utility stocks possibly ripe for takeovers. Dividends paid by the utilities produce a combined yield of 7.4%; investors could reap additional profits if any of the utilities were actually taken over.    Edward Tirello, Shearson's utility analyst, says he developed the trust because he foresees more smaller utilities being gobbled up by larger ones, as the smaller firms find it more difficult to compete under deregulation. The unit trust, which expires in five years, has a minimum investment of $1,000; sales commissions range from 1.5% to 4%, depending on the amount purchased.    Mr. Gibson says he doesn't like investments such as this because they are &quot;a bet on one particular industry.&quot; He also doesn't like the fact that -- like all unit investment trusts -- the portfolio isn't managed. &quot;What happens if 20 of the 60 utility stocks get in trouble and you want to sell them but you can't?&quot; he says. &quot;This is the equivalent of a mutual fund sector fund, and you need the judgment of a full-time professional.&quot;    Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp., the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm, says an investor could accomplish the same objective at less cost by buying a no-load utility mutual fund. But Shearson's Mr. Tirello says that wouldn't be as good because the utility stocks in his firm's unit investment trust have been specially selected for their takeover potential.    Morgan Olmstead Kennedy andamp; Gardner Inc., a Los Angeles-based regional brokerage firm, suggests another alternative. It says that nervous investors could buy a utility stock with good fundamentals, such as Southern California Edison Co., and then sell a call option on the shares.    A call option gives the holder the right to buy a security at a fixed price within a fixed time period. When the person selling the option owns the shares in question, the option is called a &quot;covered call option.&quot;    Investors sell, or &quot;write,&quot; covered calls as a way of enhancing a stock's yield when they expect the stock's price to stay about the price as it's currently trading. In return, they collect an option premium, or fee, that reflects the level of volatility in the stock market and other factors.    David D. Holt, director of technical research at Morgan Olmstead, says this approach is a &quot;conservative, non-glamorous strategy that can actually make a couple of bucks in a tough market.&quot; While options typically run for three or four months, sellers' premiums are immediately credited to their accounts. Mr. Holt says the strategy could result in an annualized return of 15% to 20%.    Mr. Quackenbush agrees that selling a covered call option can be a &quot;reasonable strategy,&quot; but he notes that investors who use this approach &quot;lose the potential for appreciation&quot; in the price of their shares. That's because the holder of the call will purchase them if the stock's price rises beyond the call price. </TEXT></DOC>
