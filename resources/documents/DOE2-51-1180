<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-1180 </DOCNO><TEXT>The continuity equations for electrons and holes in an illuminated Schottky-barrierjunction are analyzed in the presence of surface recombination. The resultsare derived for an n-type semiconductor, but are equally valid for ap-type semiconductor. The analysis is also valid for the case of semiconductor-electrolytesolar cells by proper substitution of the currents describing chargetransfer kinetics at the interface. The net current due to each typeof carrier in the junction is shown to depend on the two characteristiccurrents: the semiconductor saturation current and the exchange currentat the interface. Electrons and holes contribute to the total currentthrough the exchange process between the metal and the conduction andvalence bands, respectively. For solar cell applications, only the minoritycarriers generate the useful current component for energy conversion.The results of the model indicate that an efficient solar cell must have(a) little communication between the conduction band and the metal, (b)good communication between the valence band and the metal, (c) littlesurface recombination, (d) strong light absorption properties, (e) widedepletion region, and (f) large hole diffusion length.</TEXT></DOC>
