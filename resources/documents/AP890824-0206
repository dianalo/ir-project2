(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lou VanWert used to amaze her friends bythrowing her shoulder out of joint with just the slightest movement.   That was before she knew her tricks were symptoms of alittle-known genetic disorder that probably plagued many circuscontortionists.   ``My father called me a bag of bones,'' said VanWert, 65, ofWilliamsville, N.Y. ``But nobody ever thought anything of it.''   The hereditary disease is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome _ in slangterms, the ``human pretzel disease.'' Its sufferers have defectivecollagen, a protein found in connective tissue.   VanWert, who was diagnosed in her late 30s, has watched closelyas five of her eight grandchildren developed mild symptoms. Shechides her granddaughter when she contorts her body because suchstunts can make the disease worse.   VanWert joined about 80 other patients, doctors and researchersthis month at the second annual conference of the Ehlers-DanlosNational Foundation. One of the organizers was Susan Stephenson, aRichmond nurse who started the group four years ago with NancyRogowski, a Southgate, Mich., secretary.   The foundation, Stephenson said, is trying to find Ehlers-Danlossufferers and inform doctors how to look for symptoms of thedisease. ``People are diagnosed oftentimes at autopsy with ourdisease,'' she said.   Stephenson, 35, found out she had Ehlers-Danlos 10 years ago. Thediscovery followed years of pain in her feet and knees, numerousoperations and countless appointments with doctors baffled by hersymptoms. ``All they ever told my parents was that I had very loosejoints and I bruised very easily.''   Her joints were so loose that she could turn over in bed anddislocate a kneecap, a shoulder or a collarbone.   After undergoing surgery three times in five months to relieveher pain, Stephenson started going to medical libraries to try tofind a disease that fit her symptoms. Her research led her to JohnsHopkins University in Baltimore, where an orthopedic surgeoncorrectly diagnosed her.   ``It's a very underdiagnosed disorder,'' said Catherine A.Stolle, an assistant professor of molecular biology at the RobertWood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J. ``If you can bediagnosed earlier, you can make choices, lifestyle choices thatavoid certain twisting motions, heavy burdens, heavy loads that willdo more damage to the joints.''   Stolle said her research is aimed at developing a test todiagnose the syndrome in young children. A prenatal test is anothergoal.   There is no cure, but some sufferers can be helped by surgery orlarge amounts of vitamin C, Stephenson said.   There are at least 11 variations of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, somemild and others that can be crippling or fatal. An estimated 1 in5,000 to 1 in 20,000 people are born with the affliction. Thefoundation has 565 members in this country and 32 in nine foreigncountries, Stephenson said.   VanWert, who wears a leg brace, and Stephenson, who uses awheelchair, said it has helped them to meet people who share theirchronic pain and sleepless nights.   ``You think you're the only one in the world,'' VanWert said,``especially when the medical profession thinks you're nuts.''   ``They don't understand your pain,'' Stephenson said. ``If youmake it through a few consecutive days without a joint dislocating,that is a major feat.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 28</NOTE></DOC>
