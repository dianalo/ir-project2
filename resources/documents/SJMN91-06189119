The wise-guy answer -- &quot;I know it when Isee it&quot; -- does not suffice. But in fact it is the closest thing to truth.;   Readers know it when they see it, too. They may ask why it is of particularinterest when a female violinist is murdered on the roof of the MetropolitanOpera House, and why it is not when a decomposing body is found in anabandoned building, but intuitively most know the answer. In a city in whichthere are, on average, six homicides each day, the ones that get more than aparagraph tend to be the killings in which the event is unusual or the victimcompelling. In the measure of column inches, their deaths are given moreweight.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WHEN THE VICTIM COMES TO LIFE AGAIN IN THECOURTROOM  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Points of ViewAnna Quindlen writes the &quot;Public and Private&quot; column for the New York Times.  </MEMO><TEXT>     If I have always had a vague unease about measuring the attributes of thedead before assigning a length to their stories, I am powerfully disturbedabout doling out punishment to their killers in a similar way. The SupremeCourt, in a reversal of its earlier rulings, said that juries who are decidingon the death penalty may consider the victim's character and the effect of thevictim's death on others in deciding whether a murderer will be executed. Ifear that they have sanctioned a system of comparative worth for the slain.;   The case in question is exactly the sort of story that winds up on page one.Charisse Christopher, the young mother of two toddlers, was murdered with abutcher knife. Her daughter was also killed; her son survived. The boy'sgrandmother testified that Nicholas cries for his mother and his littlesister, that he sometimes says of the latter, &quot;I'm worried about my Lacie.&quot;;   The court had to consider whether such testimony during the penalty phaseunfairly influenced the jury, which sentenced the killer to death. If it hadnot influenced them, they must all have been made of stone.;    Several yearsago I spent some time with a group of parents of murdered children. There isone thing you are certain of after you've listened to their stories, and thatis that you have just had a glimpse of a special circle of hell. A woman fromthat group said the other day that she was delighted by the court's decision.&quot;Everything before was for the criminals,&quot; she said, echoing a sentiment thathas become a constant refrain in this country. &quot;Somebody had to stand up forthe victim.&quot;;    But while this decision may seem to place victim and killeron a more equal footing, what it could also come to mean is that some victimsare more equal than others. The cries of Christopher's small son damn herkiller. What if she had been childless? What if her mother had not beenarticulate nor her child able to verbalize his bereavement?;    I know peoplefind it painful when the murder of their child receives no publicity and themurder of someone else's is mourned in a long feature story. How doublyhurtful to discover that the murder of a rootless son might be consideredinherently less worthy of punishment than the murder of an accomplisheddaughter.;    It puts me in mind of civil cases which seek damages forwrongful death. The family of the 30-year-old surgeon may receive millions,based upon future earning capabilities; the parents of a child whose promisewas unplumbed may settle for much, much less. The system explicitly assesseshow much a life is worth.;    Now the system of sentencing a killer to deathcan do something similar. There are those who hail it as a victory forvictims, giving them a human face. And any smart prosecutor already seeks todo that, to make the dead live again in the courtroom within the limits ofjudicial discretion.;    But shifting the focus of the penalty phase incapital cases from the murder to its victim implicitly invites jurors to dosomething more than humanize. I fear the result will be to render some victimsless worthy than others, even if the pain their murders have causedreverberates as strongly for the family of a poor pregnant teen-ager as itdoes for the family of a privileged medical student. I fear that some crimeswill be adjudged human interest murders, worthier of stop-the-pressespenalties.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Anna Quindlen column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910707  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  756  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 7, 199100189119,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
