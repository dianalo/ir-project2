Claude Hudson, a national director of theNAACP and longtime civil rights activist who once was jailed for hisefforts to end segregation, has died at age 102.   Hudson, a dentist for 58 years, had been hospitalized sinceSaturday with pneumonia. He died Thursday.   Since 1953, he served on the national board of directors of theNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and haddevoted his life to ensuring equality for all people, friends said.   ``He was one of our great freedom fighters,'' said Jose DeSosa,state chairman of the NAACP. ``Dr. H. Claude Hudson has left hisfootprints in the sand throughout the United States in his effortand involvement in the NAACP.''   Hudson was born April 19, 1886, the son of sharecropper parentsin Marksville, La., and came to Los Angeles in 1923, reportedly atthe urging of Louisiana law enforcement who felt he stirred up toomuch trouble while president of the Shreveport, La., chapter of theNAACP.   ``At that time, being a member of the NAACP was tantamount tobeing a member of the suicide club,'' said family spokeswoman GiseleHudson.   He graduated from Wiley College in Texas, and from HowardUniversity Dental School in Washington, D.C. In 1931, he became thefirst black to receive a law degree from Loyola University School ofLaw, Mrs. Hudson said.   It was at Howard that he developed a longstanding involvementwith the NAACP, which held its first convention at the university.   While head of the Los Angeles NAACP chapter, Hudson was involvedin efforts to end segregation on county beaches. He and seven otherNAACP leaders briefly were jailed in 1925 after wading into theocean to test the policy at Manhattan Beach.   They were fined $500 for violating the no-swimming ordinanceapplying to blacks, but the case later was thrown out by the courts,and the segregation policy abandoned, Mrs. Hudson said.   He is survived by his wife, Lena, four children, and fivegrandchildren.   Services were scheduled for Feb. 2 in Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
