Theestimated weighted-average dumping margins are shown in the ``Suspensionof Liquidation'' section of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since our notice of preliminary determinations (53 FR 45328, November 9,1988), the following events have occurred. All respondents and petitionerrequested that the final determinations in all of the antidumping dutyinvestigations be postponed until not later than 135 days after the dateof publication of the preliminary determinations, pursuant to section 735(a)(2)of the Act. On December 2, 1988, we issued a notice postponing our finaldeterminations until not later than March 24, 1989 (53 FR 49581, December8, 1988). That notice also announced the scheduling of the public hearingin these investigations. Verification of the questionnaire responses was conducted in France andthe United States during November l988 and January 1989. A public hearing was held on February 15, 1989. Petitioner, respondents,and other interested parties have filed pre- and post-hearing briefs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions forconvenience and Customs purposes. The Department's written descriptionof the products under investigation remains dispositive as to the scopeof the products covered by these investigations. These determinations cover ball bearings, mounted or unmounted, and partsthereof (ball bearings); spherical roller bearings; mounted or unmounted,and parts thereof (spherical roller bearings); cylindrical roller bearings,mounted or unmounted, and parts thereof (cylindrical roller bearings);needle roller bearings, mounted or unmounted, and parts thereof (needleroller bearings); and spherical plain bearings, mounted or unmounted, andparts thereof (spherical plain bearings). For a complete description ofthese products, see Appendix A to the ``Final Determinations of Sales atLess Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered RollerBearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany'' (hereinafterreferred to as Appendix A) which is published in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> <ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise </ITAG>Subsequent to the initiation of these investigations, the Department determinedthat the products under investigation constituted five separate classesor kinds of merchandise. After consideration of all comments, arguments,and information submitted by the parties, we find no reason to alter thatdecision. For a full discussion of our position on class or kind of merchandise,see Appendix B which is referred to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Standing </ITAG>We determine that petitioner has standing with respect to each of the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise described in Appendix A. For a full discussionof standing see Appendix B, which is referred to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Issues </ITAG>Appendix B to the ``Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value:Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereoffrom the Federal Republic of Germany'' (hereinafter referred to as AppendixB) contains detailed discussions of all issues timely raised by partiesto the proceeding in each of the concurrent antidumping duty investigationsinvolving AFBs from nine countries. The first part of that Appendix addressesall general issues raised during these investigations and our treatmentof these topics. The general issues discussed therein are listed below.1. Class or Kind of Merchandise 2. Standing 3. Products Covered 4. Basis for Cost of Production Investigations 5. Market Viability 6. Alternative Reporting Requirements 7. Critical Circumstances 8. Administrative Protective Order Issues</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Following the discussion of general issues, all remaining commentsare addressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>The period of investigation (POI) is October 1, 1987 through March 31,1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of certain AFBs from France to the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States priceto the foreign market value as specified in the ``United States Price''and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, we have determined that useof the best information available is appropriate for spherical plain bearingsfrom SKF. <T3>See</T3>, Best Information Available section of Appendix B.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>Since all sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importationinto the United States, we based United States price on exporter's salesprice (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. The calculation of United States price for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>INA Roulements S.A. (INA):</T3> INA reported that more than 33 percentby volume of its U.S. sales were identical to products sold in the homemarket. (<T3>See,</T3> Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons. We calculated ESP based on packed, f.o.b. U.S. warehouse prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for foreign inland freight and insurance, brokerage and handling (whichincluded marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S. inland freight and insurance,and containerization), and U.S. duty in accordance with section 772(d)(2)of the Act. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for warranty expenses,credit, repacking in the United States, and indirect selling expenses (includingadvertising, technical service expenses, inventory carrying costs, warehousing,product liability premiums, other miscellaneous indirect selling expensesincurred in the U.S. and home markets) pursuant to sections 772(e) (1)and (2) of the Act. We added the amount of value-added taxes which wouldhave been collected if the merchandise had not been exported. Based on verified information, we modified various claimed deductions asdescribed in the appropriate comment sections in Appendix B. B. <T3>SKF Compagnie d'Applications Mecaniques S.A. (SKF):</T3> As a resultof dropping (1) related party transactions and (2) sales to trading companiesof exported merchandise from the home market data base, less than 33 percentby volume of SKF's U.S. sales had identical matches in the home market.(<T3>See, </T3>Alternative Reporting Requirements section of Appendix B.)Lacking these comparisons, we have applied best information available forthose sales to achieve the 33 percent threshold. We have used SKF's calculatedmargin as best information available since this rate was higher than therate calculated for this class or kind of merchandise for any other respondentin France. We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b. or delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for brokerage and handling, inland freight, marine insurance, ocean freight,and U.S. duty, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We alsomade deductions, where appropriate, for cash discounts and rebates. Wemade further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for credit, repackingin the United States, technical service expenses, warranty expenses, andindirect selling expenses (including product liability premiums, inventorycarrying costs, and other miscellaneous indirect selling expenses incurredin the U.S. and home markets) pursuant to sections 772(e) (1) and (2) ofthe Act. We added ``other expenses'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>price corrections). We also added the amount of value-addedtaxes which would have been collected if the merchandise had not been exported.SKF notified the Department that approximately three percent of its reportedU.S. sales of ball bearings were produced in a country other than France.SKF claims that although it is impossible to separate sales of this merchandisefrom those that it produced in France, United States prices of multiple-sourcedproducts are comparable. For reasons outlined in the Best Information Availablesection of Appendix B, we have included all reported sales in our calculationof United States price. SKF also notified us that all reported sales of a certain type of bearingwhich is not normally produced by SKF in France were actually producedin Spain. We deleted all sales of this product from our calculations.C. <T3>Societe Nouvelle de Roulements (SNR)</T3>: SNR reported that more than33 percent by volume of its U.S. sales were identical to products soldin the home market. (<T3>See, </T3>Alternative Reporting Requirements Section of Appendix B.)Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our ESP comparison. We calculated ESP based on packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated customersin the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, forbrokerage and handling, foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance,marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S. duty, and U.S. inland freight, inaccordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We also made deductions fordiscounts and rebates. We made further deductions for credit and indirectselling expenses (including inventory carrying costs, commissions, technicalservice expenses, advertising, and other miscellaneous indirect sellingexpenses incurred in the U.S. and home markets) pursuant to sections 772(e)(1) and (2) of the Act. We added the amount of value-added taxes whichwould have been collected if the merchandise had not been exported. Based on verified information, we recalculated inventory carrying coststo account for both time in European inventory and in transit. II. Spherical Roller Bearings <T3>SKF</T3>: SKF reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. We calculated ESP for spherical roller bearings based on the packed, f.o.b.or delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings. III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings A. <T3>INA</T3>: INA reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. We calculated ESP for cylindrical roller bearings based on packed, f.o.b.U.S. warehouse prices to unrelated customers. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings. B. <T3>SNR</T3>: SNR reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. We calculated ESP based on packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated customersin the United States. The adjustments were identical to those describedabove for ball bearings. IV. Needle Roller Bearings <T3>INA</T3>: INA reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons. We calculated ESP for needle roller bearings based on packed, f.o.b. U.S.warehouse prices to unrelated customers. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings. V. Spherical Plain Bearings <T3>SKF</T3>: SKF did not report any U.S. sales of spherical plain bearingsor of any other products under investigation during the POI. However, atverification we determined that SKF did have U.S. sales of spherical plainbearings during the POI. Therefore, we have used best information availablefor purposes of the final determination. (<T3>See, </T3>Best Information Available section of Appendix B.) <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a)(1)(2) of the Act, we calculated foreignmarket value based on home market sales or constructed value (CV). Thecalculation of foreign market value for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below. I. Ball Bearings A. <T3>INA</T3>: We calculated foreign market value based on delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions from thehome market price, where appropriate, for inland freight and home marketpacking. We added U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordancewith section 773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we deducted credit expenses fromhome market price. We also deducted indirect selling expenses (includinginventory carrying costs, product liability premiums, product liabilitypayments, technical services, advertising, and other miscellaneous indirectselling expenses) in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). As U.S. packing expenses, INA reported only repacking which occurred atthe U.S. warehouse and did not include the costs incurred for packing performedin the home market for shipment to the United States. Therefore, as bestinformation available for U.S. packing, we used home market packing andadded this to the home market price, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)of the Act. We made an upward adjustment to tax-exclusive home market pricesfor the value added tax we computed for United States price. Based on verified information, we modified various claimed deductions asdescribed in the appropriate comment sections in Appendix B. B. <T3>SKF</T3>: Petitioner alleged that SKF's home market sales of ball bearingswere made at prices below the cost of production (COP). Based on the petitioner'sallegation, we gathered and verified data on SKF's production costs. Wecalculated the COP on the basis of SKF's cost of materials, labor, otherfabrication costs, and general and administrative expenses. The COP datasubmitted by SKF was relied upon, except in the following instances wherethe costs were not appropriately quantified or valued. These were: (1) ADR's cost of manufacturing in the fourth quarter of 1987 was changedto correct the reversal of prior years' accruals which did not pertainto manufacturing products under investigation. (2) Cost of balls purchased from related companies for use at Clamart'sSt. Cyr factory was adjusted to correct a clerical error. (3) Restructuring expenses associated with the production of precisionbearings were allocated over the cost of goods sold by ADR's parent company,SFI-SKF. (4) General expenses for the first quarter of 1988 were adjusted to reflectClamart's share of actual research and development expenditures incurredby a related company. (5) General expenses were adjusted to correct a clerical error and to includea portion of the corporate headquarter (Sweden) expenses which had notbeen allocated to the subsidiaries.(6) Interest expense was adjusted to reflect the net financial expensesrelated to operations of the SKF consolidated corporation.(7) SKF's general expenses in each quarter of 1987 were adjusted to reflectthe annualized percentage for the fiscal year. (8) For products which were sold by SKF but not produced during the POI,we compared sales price to verified cost information for the most recentquarter of production. (9) Clamart's cost of manufacturing for the fourth quarter of 1987 wasadjusted to include the effect of certain fiscal year-end adjustments relatedto bearing production. We calculated the foreign market value based on CV, where appropriate,in accordance with Section 773(e) of the Act. CV was calculated on thebasis of SKF's material fabrication costs plus general expenses and profit.Since SKF's general expenses exceeded the statutory minimum of 10 percentof fabrication costs, we used SKF's general expenses. Since profit wasless than the statutory minimum of eight percent, we used the statutoryminimum for profit. Imputed credit and inventory carrying costs were includedin selling expenses. Therefore, interest expense reflected in the companybooks was reduced for a portion of the expense related to these costs inorder to avoid double counting. All of the changes noted under the COPwere also made to those cost elements in the CV. We added U.S. packing.We deducted all direct selling expenses and indirect selling expenses upto the amount of the ESP offset. Where we found that sufficient sales were above cost to permit the useof these sales as the basis for determining foreign market value, we calculatedforeign market value based on packed, c.i.f. prices to unrelated customersin the home market. We made deductions from the home market price, whereappropriate, for inland freight, home market packing, and discounts andrebates. We made an addition for freight revenue and packing revenue. Weadded U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordance with section773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions included in our analysis involved ESP, we madefurther deductions from home market price, where appropriate, for credit,advertising, technical services and warranty expenses. We also deductedindirect selling expenses (including inventory carrying costs, inland freight[from factory to warehouse], product liability premiums, and other miscellaneousindirect selling expenses incurred in the home market) in accordance with19 CFR 353.15(c). We made an upward adjustment to tax-exclusive home marketprices for the value added tax we computed for United States price. Werecalculated SKF's claimed miscellaneous indirect selling expenses as describedin the Selling Expenses section of Appendix B. C. <T3>SNR: </T3>We calculated foreign market value based on delivered andex-works packed prices to unrelated customers. We made deductions fromthe home market price, where appropriate, for packing, rebates, inlandfreight, and insurance. We added U.S. packing to the home market price,in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all U.S. transactions involved ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for credit. We also made an adjustmentin accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c) to home market prices for indirectselling expenses (including technical services, advertising, quality control,product liability premiums, inventory carrying costs, and inland freightrelated to regional warehouses, and other miscellaneous indirect sellingexpenses). We made an upward adjustment to tax-exclusive home market pricesfor the value added tax we computed for United States price. Based on verified information, we modified various claimed deductions asdescribed in the appropriate comment section in Appendix B. II. Spherical Roller Bearings <T3>SKF: </T3>We calculated foreign market value for spherical roller bearingsbased on f.o.b. prices to unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings. III. Cylindrical Roller Bearings A. <T3>INA: </T3>We calculated foreign market value for cylindrical rollerbearings based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market.The adjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings.B. <T3>SNR: </T3>We calculated foreign market value for cylindrical rollerbearings based on packed, ex-works prices to unrelated customers. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings. IV. Needle Roller Bearings <T3>INA: </T3>We calculated foreign market value for needle roller bearingsbased on delivered prices to unrelated customers in the home market. Theadjustments were identical to those described above for ball bearings.V. Spherical Plain Bearings <T3>SKF: </T3>SKF did not report any U.S. sales of spherical plain bearingsor of any other products under investigation during the POI. However, atverification we determined that SKF did have U.S. sales of spherical plainbearings during the POI. Therefore, we have used best information availablefor purposes of the final determination. (<T3>See</T3>, Best Information Available section of Appendix B.) <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion </ITAG>We used the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of U.S. sales,in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, as amended by section615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currency conversions weremade at the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>We verified the information used in making our final determinations inaccordance with section 776(b) of the Act. We used standard verificationprocedures including examination of relevant accounting records and originalsource documents of the respondents. Our verification results are outlinedin the public versions of the verification reports which are on file inthe Central Records Unit (Room B-099) of the Main Commerce Building. <ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments </ITAG>As noted above, all comments raised by parties to the proceedings in theantidumping duty investigations on AFBs from nine countries are discussedin Appendix B. <ITAG tagnum="84">Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation </ITAG>We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationof all entries of the subject merchandise from France, as defined in the``Scope of Investigations'' section of this notice, that are entered, orwithdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publicationof this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Our preliminary determinations with regard to needle roller bearings fromINA were negative. Therefore, the suspension of liquidation on needle rollerbearings from INA is effective on the date of publication of this notice.The U.S. Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bondequal to the estimated amounts by which the foreign market value of thesubject merchandise from France exceeds the United States price, as shownbelow.
