GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thais have normally reacted tocorruption with a fatalistic shrug, but a racket involving falseroyal decorations has raised a public outcry and spurred thegovernment into action.   Some call this a hopeful sign in battling what has been anendemic problem.   The racket had allowed hundreds of people to obtain prestigiousroyal decorations by making phony donations to charities. The webof corruption, according to police, involves officials of theCabinet and the Education Ministry, as well as a now defrockedBuddhist monk, Deputy Abbot Pasuk Kaopong.   Police say that nearly 20 people have been detained, some onsuspicion of forging the signature of King Bhumibol Adulyadej,regarded by many Thais as a near divinity. One senior civil servantin the Cabinet secretariat killed himself after being called in forquestioning.   The result is that even bona fide royal decorations, onceproudly worn at every opportunity, are now viewed with somecynicism.   So is the government's fortnightly lottery. Late last year, 15senior officials were arrested on charges of rigging the lotterywheels via radio-controlled devices.   From Forestry Department officials who illegally chop down treesto police officers smuggling refugees, ``corruption'' _ the Englishword is frequently used _ has become a daily staple of localnewspapers and private conversation.   Amnouy Vongvichian, who heads the Commission of CounterCorruption, said in an interview his agency investigated 3,418civil-service corruption cases last year and found about 10 percentof the suspects guilty.   Some Thais believe corruption stems from greed spawned by therapid destruction of traditional Thai values. Others believecorruption may well be on the decline in Thailand, but is merelygetting greater exposure through a freer press and the efforts ofPrime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, who took office in 1980 andrecently stepped up his anti-corruption drive.   However, Surin Pitsuwan, a member of Parliament, says Prem hasyet to move against powerful figures, including allegedly corruptsenior officers in the armed forces.   ``There is a Thai proverb which says: `You put fear into themonkeys by slaughtering the chickens,' '' Surin said in aninterview. ``The prime minister may only be able to go so far, buthe is saying: `We should not be fatalistic about corruption. Heyno, I'll show you something can be done.' ''   Prem is a staunch royalist and it is said he was particularlyincensed by disclosures that for 150,000 baht ($6,000) anapplication for a royal decoration could be processed _ completewith fake documents citing large donations to charity _ all the wayto his own Cabinet.   Also recently exposed was a massive racket involving officialsand police in Trat province near the Cambodian border smuggling inVietnamese ``boat people,'' running guns and engaging in illegaltrade with what is an enemy nation. The Trat governor has resignedand six police officers have been transferred as the investigationcontinues.   ``Over the last five to 10 years morality has lost its force. Ithas been replaced by coveted status symbols,'' says Dr. ChiraHongladarom, vice rector of Bangkok's Thammasat University. ``Whatreward does an honest person get in this society?''   But Chira sees some hopeful signs. He and other analysts saycorrupt officials must now move more cautiously and employ moresubtle techniques than in the past.   Arrayed against the so-called ``influential people'' are a fewapparently incorruptible officials, politicians and military menwho have won wide admiration.   One is Chamlong Srimuang, the mayor of Bangkok, who donates hissalary to charity, sleeps on the floor at home and wears simpleclothing.   The hero in the Trat case is a low-ranking official namedSurachet Supathit. According to newspaper accounts, he tried vainlyto expose illegal activities to his superiors and refused a largebribe offered by ``influential people'' who wanted him to registersix Vietnamese refugees as Thai nationals.   Shortly thereafter, two men entered his house, held his wife atgunpoint and shot him to death.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs March 7</NOTE></DOC>
