The Canadian Union of Postal Workers, representing 23,000 indoor employees, has been staging rotating strikes across Canada for eight days. Canada Post Corp., a government-owned agency, is using temporary employees at strike-bound plants and is refusing to allow strikers back to work immediately in some areas.    Yesterday, postal employees were either on strike or locked out in 210 locations across Canada, including Montreal and Ottawa.    Negotiations broke off Monday after two hours because &quot;the two sides were still too far apart,&quot; a Canada Post spokesman said.    Mr. Cadieux said in a telegram to both sides that the breakdown in talks was &quot;unacceptable&quot; and he warned that the government would introduce legislation for an arbitrated settlement if &quot;the parties are incapable of resolving the dispute through collective bargaining.&quot;    The most contentious issue in the dispute is Canada Post's plans to franchise some operations to the private sector. The union has been without a contract since Dec. 30, 1986. In 15 months of collective bargaining, the two sides have failed to resolve any contentious issues. </TEXT></DOC>
