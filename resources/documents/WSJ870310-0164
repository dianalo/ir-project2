Airbus's president, Jean Pierson, said during a recent visit to Tokyo that Airbus would like Japanese companies to participate in the development of an engine, electrical and electronic equipment and other nonstructural devices, the spokesman said. Airbus has the Japanese ministry's &quot;blessing,&quot; the spokesman added. But, he said, Airbus is &quot;on its own&quot; regarding whether Japanese companies choose to participate in the A340 project. The companies &quot;will weigh their decisions on commercial and financial factors,&quot; he said.    The spokesman said Japanese involvement with the A340 wouldn't hamper the aviation industry's involvement in a project led by Boeing Co. of the U.S. to develop a medium-range passenger jet. </TEXT></DOC>
