Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,called the weekend meeting a ``successful and constructive summit''but warned of pressure that it might exert on ongoingweapons-reduction negotiations.   ``There's nothing wrong with the leaders giving a push to thearms control negotiators, but there would be danger here if wepushed them so hard and so fast that we get a bad agreement, ratherthan one that will stand the test of time,'' Nunn said on CBS-TV's``Face the Nation.''   President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev endedtheir two-day summit on Sunday, hailing a new era of East-Westpeace. Both leaders said they would meet again in June in theUnited States with the possibility of agreements in 1990 to cutlong-range nuclear weapons and conventional forces as well asprogress toward a chemical weapons ban.   Nunn proposed that the superpower leaders set up teams todiscuss long-range cutbacks beyond agreements currently beingnegotiated.   ``Conceptual discussions now should not have to wait thedetails,'' Nunn said, adding, ``But neither should we startnegotiating new things which would even further delay the existingnegotiations.''   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas also expressedconcern that Bush and Gorbachev might be putting too much pressureon arms control negotiators to reach agreements.   ``I'm a little bit concerned about trying to put a deadline onany arms control negotiations,'' said Dole, adding, ``I hope thatwasn't done.'' He said he needed more details of the summit talksbefore making a final assessment.   Dole, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''said the summit put Bush ``back in the global arena. He's providingleadership, and that's good for all of us.''   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called thefirst Bush-Gorbachev summit a ``successful meeting'' which shouldlead to both weapons reductions and a better economic relationshipwith the Soviet Union.   Mitchell, also interviewed on ABC, said he supports ``mostfavored nation'' trade status for the Soviet Union but said itwould not likely produce any significant increase in sales ofSoviet-made goods in this country.   ``They've got some things to sell but not much that Americans orother countries will want to buy,'' Mitchell said.   The administration has promised to give Moscow increasedbenefits, and to support its bid to participate in the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international tradingorganization, in exchange for Soviet relaxation of emigrationrestrictions on Soviet Jews.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., interviewed on CNN's ``SundayToday,'' said he expects Bush to have more trouble with Republicansthan Democrats in getting ratification of treaties with the Soviets.   He said Congress likely would repeal laws that restrict tradewith the Soviet Union.   ``I think the Congress is ready and prepared to support that, solong as the Soviet performance on immigration remains good, whichit has been in recent months,'' Hamilton said.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said the events in Eastern Europe upstaged the summit,reaffirming the fact that ``the two most powerful countries in theworld don't make all the key decisions about the world.''   Aspin in a statement also called the two-day superpower sessiona ``potatoes summit. The meaty summit will come next summer.''   ``The potatoes summit is important, nonetheless,'' said Aspin,who hailed the unprecedented joint Bush-Gorbachev news conferencefor making it clear that ``our differences have not disappeared ...and we can cope with them in a civilized manner, that is to say, ina political rather than a military way.''</TEXT></DOC>
