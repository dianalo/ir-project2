John McGurk, a health department official who is investigating the incident, said the suit would allege that the publicly traded unit, ICN Biomedicals Inc., violated state regulations requiring notice of the explosion within 24 hours. ICN's unit, he said, waited 12 days to give notice, and only then informed the state after it had received a citation by a state inspector.    An ICN Pharmaceuticals spokesman said the company &quot;notified the state in a time frame we thought was appropriate. It took time to determine how much (gas) went out.&quot; The spokesman said the state has characterized the incident in &quot;overly dramatic&quot; terms.    The civil penalty is $5,000 for each day's delay in complying with the regulation. State and county health officials said there doesn't appear to be any near-term danger to public health from the explosion, but various agencies took air, water and soil samples this week to study possible long-term effects.    In its March 8 report to the state, ICN said the explosion occurred at 11:30 p.m. and asserted that one employee was exposed to the gas while cleaning up the following morning.    Radioactive hydrogen, also known as tritium, is used in pharmaceutical research. ICN Biomedicals makes and markets research chemicals. ICN Pharmaceuticals and various publicly traded units make and market the drug Virazole, which is being tested for use with AIDS patients.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, ICN Pharmaceuticals closed at $7.25, unchanged, while ICN Biomedicals closed in national over-the-counter trading at $5.75, down 37.5 cents. Both companies are based in Costa Mesa, although the explosion occured at a plant in an industrial park in nearby Irvine.    State officials also said they are &quot;escalating&quot; the investigation to determine whether to bring criminal charges against the ICN unit for possibly misleading the health department about the nature of the February incident. On March 1, Mr. McGurk says, &quot;They made a sketchy call (to the health department) indicating that there was a 'potential' release (of gas), not an actual release.&quot;    Kim Wong, a state health inspector who visited the ICN plant, said the area where the explosion occurred was equipped with a radiation monitor that would have shown there had been a leak of radioactive gas. &quot;They should have told us right away,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
