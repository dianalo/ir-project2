A new approach isnecessary to improve the efficacy of debugging tools and to adapt themto the framework of a concurrent software environment. A knowledge-baseddebugging approach is presented that aids diagnosis of a variety of run-timeerrors that can occur in concurrent programs written in the programminglanguage. Ada in this approach, an event stream of program activity iscaptured in an historical database and accessed using Prolog queriesextended with temporal-logic predicates. Diagnosis is aided by applyingrule-based descriptions of some common classes of software errors andby matching program specifications against the trace database. This approachwas used in building a prototype debugger, called Your Own Debugger forAda (YODA). The design of YODA is described and analyses of several sampleAda programs are presented to illustrate diagnosis of errors associatedwith concurrency, including deadness errors and misuse of shared data.</TEXT></DOC>
