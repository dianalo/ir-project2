The heated fight over rights to the drug, callederythropoietin, or EPO, is important for both companies,because EPO is one of the biotechnology industry's mostpromising products. After the March decision that awardedU.S. rights to Amgen, its stock soared and GeneticsInstitute's stock plummeted.</LP><TEXT>   The new patent strengthens Genetics Institute's positionin a possible battle over European rights to EPO with Amgen,a Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotechnology concern. GeneticsInstitute said a European process patent on EPO previouslygranted for Amgen's version of the drug &quot;discloses a genesequence which is incomplete and different in certain aspectsas compared to the sequence of the Genetics Institute patent.We believe that our patent covers the actual commercialprocess utilized&quot; in making Amgen's version of EPO in Europe.   However, Genetics Institute's patent isn't expected togive it a clear-cut advantage over Amgen in Europe, saidRobert Kupor, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. SinceAmgen's EPO already was covered by a similar &quot;process&quot; patentin Europe, Genetics Institute &quot;needed the same kind ofpowerful patent so it can bargain with Amgen&quot; over Europeanrights to EPO, he added.   The companies eventually may cross-license their Europeanrights to EPO, he said. Both versions of the drug already aremarketed in Europe.   Genetics Institute added that it has other European patentapplications pending related to its EPO, which has beenexclusively licensed in Europe to Germany's BoehringerMannheim G.m.b.H.   An Amgen spokesman said it would be &quot;inappropriate to sayanything about {Genetics Institute's} patent until we've readit&quot; although Amgen is generally &quot;comfortable&quot; with its patentposition. The biotechnology concern was granted a Europeanpatent last July on its EPO drug, which is sold in Europe byan affiliate of Johnson andamp; Johnson under license by an Amgenjoint venture.   Genetics Institute in March lost a patent battle againstAmgen in a U.S. appeals court over U.S. rights to EPO. Theruling was a serious blow for Genetics Institute, which wasbanking on U.S. sales of its EPO as a major source of revenuein coming years. U.S. sales of Amgen's EPO are expected toreach more than $1 billion annually by 1993, according toTeena Lerner, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros.   Following the announcement of the ruling, GeneticsInstitute's stock plummeted $21.75 to $40.25. Yesterday, thecompany's stock rose $2 a share to close at $31.25, whileAmgen's stock rose $4.50 to close at $133.75.   Separately, Genetics Institute disclosed that theSecurities and Exchange Commission plans to investigate the35% decline in its stock value following its recent loss incourt over U.S. rights to EPO.   In a filing with the SEC related to a proposed stockoffering, Genetics Institute disclosed that the Boston officeof the SEC &quot;orally advised&quot; the company that &quot;it intends toconduct an inquiry of Genetics Institute&quot; as a result of thestock drop after the court ruling. The company added that ithasn't received notice of the initiation of an SEC inquiry,and a spokeswoman for the company said the SEC hasn'tdisclosed what questions it plans to address in the inquiry.An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the matter.   The SEC filing by Genetics Institute also disclosed that aGenetics shareholder, who wasn't named, requested its boardto investigate the company's decision to develop EPO and tolitigate EPO patent claims. The holder also requested theboard to investigate recent stock sales by certain GeneticsInstitute officers and directors. Company attorneys respondedthat the shareholder's assertions are without merit,according to the filing.</TEXT></DOC>
