Brown, as Jackson's manager at the July convention in Atlanta,will oversee the campaign's efforts on the standing committees, theparty platform and rules, an area where campaign officials havehinted Jackson might orchestrate a challenge.   Jackson has assembled an experienced convention crew that alsoincludes: Ann Lewis, a former Democratic National Committeepolitical director who has been advising the Jackson campaign;Eleanor Holmes Norton, former chairwoman of the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission; attorney Harold Ickes, an expert on rules;and John O'Leary, a logistics whiz and campaign veteran who was thehall manager at the 1984 Democratic convention.   Jackson campaign coordinator Yolanda Carroway, also a former DNCofficial, will work directly under Brown. Brown was deputy chairmanof the DNC from 1981 to 1985, and worked for Sen. Edward Kennedy'spresidential campaign in 1980.   Carroway said former DNC Chairman John White also will adviseJackson at the convention.   DNC spokesman Mike McCurry said party officials are viewing theappointment of Brown as a good sign because of his strong links tothe party and knowledge of the establishment ropes.   ``They're playing real good ball right now ... they're keepinglines open with the party,'' McCurry said.   ``It helps to have people that have been on the inside,'' saidCarroway, acknowledging that the convention team was selected withparty connections in mind.   Asked if Jackson picked a convention team to send a message thathe will be conciliatory rather than confrontational at theconvention, Carroway said, ``I'm sure that was considered.''   Some in the party have been concerned that Jackson might force arift at the convention, especially in light of his recentinsistence on ``fairness'' in the allocation of the so-called``super delegates.'' Those individuals, who are delegates by virtueof their elected or party offices, are free to vote for thecandidate of their choice, but Jackson says they should line upproportionately to the popular vote.   Carroway said Monday that the campaign has not yet decidedwhether to mount a challenge on seating of delegates, but that``it's being talked about.''   Lewis will oversee Jackson's involvement with the standingcommittees, Norton will be the campaign's representative on thePlatform Committee, and Ickes will focus on rules. O'Leary willhandle the physical and logistical arrangements.</TEXT></DOC>
