An initial review by Senate staff members found that fourdocuments introduced as evidence in North's trial never were turnedover to congressional investigators in 1987 when they looked intothe administration's Iran arms deal and Contra support initiatives.   Two other documents in the committee's files are similar to onesreleased at the trial, but are missing important attachments ornotations.   One document, an April 25, 1985, memo from then-NationalSecurity Adviser Robert McFarlane, recommends that Reagan telephoneHonduran President Roberto Suazo to reassure him of U.S. backingfor the Contras. Missing from the congressional copy is thenotation, ``cc Vice President,'' apparently signaling that GeorgeBush was sent a copy of the memo.   ``These six documents are sufficient to raise questions aboutthe procedures followed by the executive branch in providingdocuments to the Iran-Contra Committee and the completeness of itscompliance with agreements on the provision of documents,'' said aletter asking for the investigation.   The request was sent to Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., and WilliamCohen, R-Maine, chairman and vice chairman of the SenateIntelligence Committee, and was signed by Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, andWarren Rudman, R-N.H., the chairman and vice chairman of theIran-Contra panel.   President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, told reportersaboard Air Force One on Wednesday, ``We will cooperate in any waywe can, but otherwise we don't know much about it.   ``This doesn't involve us directly,'' Fitzwater said. ``This isbetween the senators and the intelligence committee. They'relooking into the last administration's procedures and it doesn'trelate to us. It's an internal matter for the Senate to look into.''   White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray, in a letter to Mitchell,said his office had contacted Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., who wasReagan's counsel during much of the time at issue, and thatCulvahouse has offered to review the matter and informally briefthe senators.   ``We have confidence that the last administration followed theagreed procedures (for releasing the material) and that itsrepresentatives will be able to address your concerns,'' Gray'sletter said. ``We, of course endeavor to be as helpful as wecan...''   Boren, in a statement, promised to ``look at this matterexpeditiously and in a businesslike, non-political manner.''   The letter said some of the documents contain key evidence aboutthe way U.S. officials conducted policy in Central America in 1985``and raise questions regarding ... possible efforts to circumventthe provisions of the law'' which barred direct or indirect U.S.aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.   A similar request was made two weeks ago by Rep. Lee Hamilton,D-Ind., who was chairman of the House Iran-Contra committee. Anaide to Hamilton said Wednesday that he had not yet received aresponse to his request of White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray.   The congressional committees, after an extensive investigation,concluded that a ``cabal of ... zealots'' in the Reaganadministration seized control of policy in the affair which sentweapons to Iran and profits from the sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.   But documents and testimony during the North trial suggest thatsenior officials up to and including Reagan and then-vice presidentGeorge Bush were more involved in the affair than the committeesknew.   Among documents which the congressional panels did not receivewere a Feb. 19, 1985, memo outlining a plan to step up U.S. aid toHonduras in return for that nation's support of the Contras, and amemo dated the following day making it clear that theadministration knew it was forbidden from providing aid under thosecircumstances.   Also not turned over to congressional investigators was an Oct.30, 1985, memo from North to McFarlane about reconnaissance ofNicaragua and mentioning the air drop of two recoilless rifles tothe rebels.   Mark Belnick, a New York attorney who was on the staff of theSenate panel, said the documents clearly should have been sent inresponse to congressional requests and would have been helpful inthe investigation. But he added, ``If this is the sum andsubstance, ... they wouldn't have materially changed any of theconclusions'' reached by investigators.</TEXT></DOC>
