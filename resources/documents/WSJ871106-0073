Volume rose yesterday to 141 million shares in Nasdaq trading, as the composite index climbed nearly 2% to 326.18.    The crowd of OTC bargain hunters is growing. &quot;We are seeing an increasing number of institutions in there, and we are starting to get some individual bargain hunters as well,&quot; said Peter J. Da Puzzo, senior executive vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers, which has a large OTC department with both institutional and retail customers.    Today, Shearson plans to put out a list of so-called fallen angels for its customers -- some six to 12 stocks in the OTC market that Shearson figures are currently &quot;low priced and oversold,&quot; according to Mr. Da Puzzo. Advest Inc., of Hartford, Conn., already is advertising such a list; dozens of other brokers are rushing out similar tip sheets to their customers, and several newsletters already have gotten into the spot-the-OTC-bargain game.    The buying is beginning to show up in the market as prices of certain target groups of stocks, from the largest to the smallest, suddenly explode. It happened yesterday as swarms of buyers bought telecommunications, telecommunications equipment and computer graphics stocks of all sizes. In the past few days larger stocks in these groups such as Intergraph, a computer graphics equipment maker; Tele-Communications Inc. and LIN Broadcasting -- jumped in price. &quot;It's filtering down to smaller stocks in these groups that weren't rebounding,&quot; says Mr. Da Puzzo.    Among the largest OTC issues, the ones institutions trade in the same way as Big Board blue chips, Tele-Communications Inc. rose 1 3/4 yesterday to 22 1/8, an 8.6% gain; and MCI Communications was up 3/4, or 8%, to 10 1/8.    But buying among the related but smaller OTC telecommunications equipment issues was so brisk yesterday that prices of many issues that were previously ignored jumped 20% and more.    Digital Communications Associates, the largest of the equipment makers with some $400 million in market value, rose 2 1/2 to 25 1/2 yesterday, an 11% gain. But among the smallest issues, Artel Communications rose 3/8 to 2, a 23% increase; Hytek Microsystems was up 3/4, or 38%, to 2 3/4; and Elcotel, which makes privately owned pay telephones, was up 3/4 to 10.    Cincinnati Microwave, a medium-sized communications equipment maker with nearly $100 million in market value, rose 1 1/8 to 5 1/2 -- a 26% jump.    Buying was particularly lively in the laser-making niche of the telecommunications group, where Coherent Inc., a middle-sized manufacturer, rose 9%, or 7/8 to 10 1/8. Control Laser International, a much smaller concern, had a 5/8 jump to 2 1/8 -- a gain of 42%.    A clue for tomorrow's bargain hunters: Among the large institutional stocks that showed strong moves yesterday for the first time since the crash were restaurant stocks -- Shoney's, the OTC's largest, was up 2 to 23 3/8 -- and discount retailers. Pic 'N' Save was up 1 to 13 1/8. </TEXT></DOC>
