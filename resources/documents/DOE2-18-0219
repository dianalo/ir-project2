This new method (RYBAD model) is an extension ofthat provided by Tandanand and Powell (1984; TP Model). The RYBAD modelaccomplishes more accurate subsidence predictions (error typically lessthan 10 percent) for a greater range of mining and geological parametersthrough the recognition of the following: 1) subsidence increases ata decreasing rate (curvilinear relationship) with greater overburdenthickness up to a critical value beyond which subsidence decreases; 2)subsidence is strongly influenced by the stratigraphic proximity of strongrocks to the coal (size of potential caving zone); and 3) subsidenceindex is related to overburden thickness by a family of curves, eachfor incremental variations in the effective percentage of strong rockin the overburden.</TEXT></DOC>
