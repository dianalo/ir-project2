In a feud that began in October, Defense Minister FritsBolkestein and the academician have traded verbal barbs via lengthycontributions to the NRC Handelsblad, the Netherlands' newspaper ofrecord.   In his most recent rejoinder, published in Wednesday's edition,Bolkestein wrote that Chomsky, an outspoken critic of the U.S.political establishment, ``has placed himself outside reality byairing his extreme views.''   Contacted by telephone in Cambridge, Mass., where he teacheslinguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chomskytold The Associated Press Thursday that ``Bolkestein has beentelling outrageous lies.''   ``Apparently, he doesn't believe in free speech,'' said theoutspoken Chomsky, who referred to Bolkestein as a ``fascist.''   The controversy began when in October, when the newspaper printeda page-long review by Bolkestein of two recent Chomsky books, ``TheCulture of Terrorism'' and ``The Chomsky Reader.''   Bolkestein was a prominent legislator for the right-wing Liberalparty before being named to his current post in August, and hisreview was accecpted before his cabinet nomination, according toPaulus Smit, the newspaper editor handling the Chomsky-Bolkesteinexchange.   In his review, headlined ``A Linguist's Grim Version OfReality,'' Bolkestein accused Chomsky of trivializing the massmurders by the Cambodian Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.   ``For Chomsky, the genocide in Cambodia ... was a deliberate lie(spread by the mass media) to cover up the real mass murders'' inCentral America perpetrated or supported by successive U.S.governments, Bolkestein wrote.   He also criticized Chomsky's defense of Robert Faurisson, aFrench historian who has denied the existence of Nazi exterminationcamps.   Faurisson, a professor of literature, caused public outrage inFrance 11 years ago by claiming that no Jews had ever been killed inNazi death camp gas chambers. The claim, published in Frenchnewspapers, led to Faurisson's suspension from the University ofLyon.   In his October article, Bolkestein noted that Chomsky was one of500 intellectuals who signed a petition defending Faurisson'sfreedom of speech, and that the American linguist wrote a preface ina Faurisson book in which Chomsky said he had found no traces ofanti-semitism in the French professor's work.   ``To call Faurisson an apolitical kind of liberal is naive orworse,'' Bolkestein wrote.   In an extensive rejoinder published by NRC Handelsblad on Dec.29, Chomsky accused the defense minister of ``trivializing crueltiesperpetrated by governments dependent of the United States and, as aresult, he is an apologist for serious crimes.''   That was an apparent reference to Bolkestein's remark that humanrights abuses were not only committed by right-wing death squads inCentral America, but also by Sandinista government troops inNicaragua.   On the Faurisson issue, Chomsky said that ``I have taken evenmore extreme stands in the struggle to defend human liberties _ inthe 1960s, I have urged that American war criminals be allowed toteach and do research, even if their work would lead to death anddestruction.''   ``Faurisson was not even accused of war crimes,'' Chomsky wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
