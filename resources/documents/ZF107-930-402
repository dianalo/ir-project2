(Managing Databases) (buyers guide)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Friedman, Rich.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>A brief overview of add-in programs for Lotus 1-2-3 is given.andO;Typically, such add-in programs expand 1-2-3's database functionsby providing the capability to create disk-based databases andallowing relational operations.andP;  By using disk-based memory,databases are not confined by available RAM or by 1-2-3's limitednumber of rows.andP;  Relational operations allow two or more tables tobe linked, thus avoiding unnecessary multiple entries.andP;  About adozen of such add-ins are currently available, some of whichinclude Computer Associates International's $149 Silverado,Personics Corp's $195 (at)Base and Triple C Software's $149 DB12III.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Lotus 1-2-3 (Spreadsheet software) (computer programs).andO;Topic:     SpreadsheetsAdd-In-On SoftwareSoftware SelectionData BasesExpandabilityDirectories.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DATABASE ADD-INS FOR 1-2-3andM;There are close to a dozen add-in programs that expand the database featuresof 1-2-3 Releases 2.01 and 2.2.andP;  Although they differ in their memoryrequirements, in their ease of use, and in the features they add to 1-2-3,many bring two main benefits to 1-2-3's database functions: relationaloperations and the ability to create disk-based databases.andM;Relational databases let you link two or more tables.andP;  This lets you avoidhaving to duplicate data in multiple tables, and it can also give you somedeeper insights into your data.andP;  Disk-based means that you can have muchlarger databases because you're not limited by the amount of available RAMnor byb 1-2-3's limit of 8,192 rows.andM;Some database add-in programs are designed to help import and export data tospecific mainframe and minicomputer database programs.andP;  Other add-ins aredesigned to ease the task of entering data into a 1-2-3 worksheet.andM;What follows is a short rundown of the more popular 1-2-3 database add-ins.andM;Silverado ($149, from Computer Associates International, 1240 McKay Dr., SanJose, CA 95131; 800-531-5236) lets you create a database of up to 32 millionsrecords and 512 fields, say its developers.andP;  However, the program creates adatabase file separate from your worksheet.andP;  You must export your 1-2-3 datato the new file before Silverado can use it.andM;Unlike 1-2-3 Releases 2.01 and 2.2, which can sort on only two databasefields, Silverado can sort your database on as many fields as the databaecontains.andP;  You must pay a high memory price, however.andP;  Silverado requires208K of RAM to run.andP;  For a review of Silverado, see the August 1988 issue,page 99.andM;@Base ($195, from Personics Corp., 63 Great Road, Maynard, MA 01754;508-897-1575) requires only 72K of RAM, But it lets you build and view arelational disk-based database of up to 32 megabytes and 128 fields.andP;  Youimport dBase data files directly into a 1-2-3 worksheet.andP;  An easy-to-use menulets you develop database queries, sort databases on any number of fields,and produce reports that are cross-tabulated.andP;  @Base brings 18 new @functionsto 1-2-3.andP;  For certain relational operations, such as joining records andindexing, you must purchase another program from Personics called Option Pac($89.95).andP;  For a review of the @Base program, see the April 1988 issue, page112.andM;DB12 III ($149, from Triple C Software, 2425 East Commercial Blvd., Suite103, Fort Lauderdale, Fl 33308; 305-772-8285) also lets you access a dBasefile while working in 1-2-3.andP;  You can view a portion of a dBase file that hasbeen imported into 1-2-3, or you can perform operations on an entire dBasefile with new @DB functions and then display the results in 1-2-3.andP;  DB12 III(pronounced dee bee one two three) provides several ways to transfer data toand from dBase files.andP;  You can import data from dBase into a worksheet,export data from a worksheet into a new dBase database, or append 1-2-3 datato the end of an existing dBase database.andM;Depending on available RAM--the program takes up 110K--you can performrelational calculations across multiple database files.andP;  One @DB formula mayreference up to 10 Criterion ranges.andP;  These ranges are combined into a singlerange for filtering records in your calculation.andP;  Of course, DB12 III doesnot have all of dBase's relational-database or sophisticated reportingcapabilities.andP;  But because DB12 III can be controlled by 1-2-3 macros, youcan build custom applications that manipulate dBase files.andP;  For a review, seethe January 1988 issue, page 133.andM;Deja! ($130, from PC Publishing, 1801 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 815, LosAngeles, CA 90067; 800-634-4555, in Canada 213-556-3630) also lets you importdBase data into 1-2-3.andP;  You can manipulate or print the imported dBase datain the same way that you can manipulate the data in any 1-2-3 database.andO;Deja! provides many @functions similar to dBase commands.andP;  You can append1-2-3 worksheet data to the bottom of an existing dBase file, or you cancreate a new dBase file from your 1-2-3 worksheet data.andP;  However, if youimport dBase data into your 1-2-3 spreadsheet and then change it, you cannotinsert the modified spreadsheet data into the original dBase data.andP;  Thesyntax of a Deja! query resembles dBase syntax more than it resembles thesyntax of 1-2-3's criterion formulas.andP;  For a review of Deja!, see the January1988 issue, page 133.andM;Informix Datasheet Add-In ($145, from Informix Software, 4100 Bohannon, Dr.,andO;Menlo Park, CA 94025; 415-926-6300) lets you share your database files withInformix database products running on your company's mini and mainframecomputers.andP;  With Datasheet you use familiar 1-2-3 menus, commands, functions,and macros to interact with your data.andP;  Datasheet lets you manipulate andcombine multiple database files from a 1-2-3 worksheet.andP;  You can also storeindex files containing unique sorts of your database.andP;  Be warned, however:Once you've attached the DataSheet Add-In to 1-2-3, you'll have only about90K of RAM left.andP;  For a review, see the February 1988 issue, page 112.andM;Oracle Database Add-In for Lotus 1-2-3, ($299, from Oracle Corp., 20 DavisDr., Belmont, CA 94002; 800-672-2531) can help you move information betweenyour PC and mainframes or other platforms running Oracle software.andP;  You canuse Oracle for 1-2-3 to query Oracle databases that reside on other PCs,networked PCs, minicomputers, or mainframes.andP;  You can even create a singlequery that retrieves data from more than one computer.andP;  Oracle for 1-2-3 usesStructured Query Language (SQL), a command language that simplifies complexsearches.andP;  The program streamlines sorting and querying operations by lettingyou use menus and prompts to write SQL statements.andM;However, compared with other database add-in programs, Oracle for 1-2-3offers little help in formatting reports, creating data-entry screens, ordefining data-entry controls.andP;  It also consumes 271K of RAM.andP;  For a review,see the November 1988 issue, page 104.andM;4Views ($149.95, from Symantec Corp., 10201 Torre Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014;408-253-9600) works directly with the 1-2-3 worksheet.andP;  Unlike the previouslymentioned programs, it does not create a disk-based database.andP;  4Views derivesits name from its ability to display data in four ways.andP;  It can show data asa table, just as it appears in a worksheet.andP;  It can display data in aone-record-per-screen format, which is helpful for entering and updatingdata.andP;  It can show a summary of your data as a cross tabulation, and it canshow your data in a report format, as it would be printed.andP;  4Views requires90K of RAM.andP;  for a review, see the August 1988 issue, page 99.andM;D.A.V.E.andP;  ($99.95, from Goldata Computer Services, 2 Bryn Mawr Ave., BrynMawr, PA 19010; 800-432-3267) is an add-in that is specifically designed tohelp get data into 1-2-3.andP;  It makes data entry simpler and, in some cases,more reliable.andP;  D.A.V.E.andP;  comes with several easily customized templates forsome common applications.andP;  There are templates for accounts payable andreceivable, payroll, purchase-order tracking, inventory management, andbudget and sales analyses.andP;  You can also use the program to print mailinglabels and form letters from your database.andM;The program lets you design input screens with lines, borders, boxes,descriptive labels, prompts, and help messages--all in color.andP;  And to helpinsure the accuracy of the data, you can specify that the data you enter inany field match specific criteria.andP;  For example, a numeric Social Securityfield will not accept letters.andP;  D.A.V.E.andP;  needs 64K or RAM.andP;  For a review,see the August 1988 issue, page 99.andM;Data Manager ($79, from Intex Solutions, 161 Highland Ave., Needham, MA02194; 617-499-6222) also speeds up and simplifies the data-entry task.andP;  Onceyou create a data-entry screen with fields, borders, and underlines, DataManager checks to see whether data complies with preset criteria.andP;  You canspecify various validation criteria, such as &quot;numeric,&quot; &quot;text,&quot; &quot;within arange,&quot; or &quot;appears in a table.&quot;andM;XYZ:Query ($145, from Intex Solutions) is a stand-alone program that readsworksheet files produced with 1-2-3 and Symphony.andP;  It can query databasesresiding on as many as 1,000 separate worksheets, produce list-style reports,and generate simple statistical summaries.andP;  If you need to retrieveinformation from multiple worksheets, XYZ:Query will save you time.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
