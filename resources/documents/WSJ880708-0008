Traders said the broad collapse wasn't warranted by changes in the weather or other fundamental developments. Many had expected prices to open higher yesterday in the wake of a National Weather Service forecast of hot and dry weather into mid-July, the corn crop's most vulnerable growing stage.    &quot;The market isn't operating like it should,&quot; a soybean broker said. &quot;Maybe we have reached a point where prices can't go much higher.&quot;    There are signs that speculative interest is waning in the Chicago Board of Trade's soybean futures pits. After leading the long grain rally with gains of roughly 50% so far this year, soybean futures have grown erratic in recent days. Open interest, a measure of the number of futures contracts outstanding, has dropped 10% from the overheated levels of a month ago.    Corn and wheat futures contracts are also top-heavy, analysts said, meaning that grain prices already have factored in so much crop damage that forecasts of hot and dry weather are losing their punch. What's more, any sign of improving weather conditions, and a chance of a last-minute reprieve for farmers, ignites panic selling.    Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said corn futures prices already reflect an autumn harvest of five billion bushels, compared with the normal 7.3 billion.    &quot;The market has fully discounted the damage for the time being,&quot; he said, &quot;so some people think the market is topping out.&quot;    Yesterday, many corn futures prices fell their daily limit of 15 cents a bushel. The July corn contract, which has no limit, dropped 22 cents to settle at $3.20 a bushel. The July soybean contract plunged 49.5 cents a bushel, or about 5%, while most other soybean contracts dropped the daily limit of 30 cents a bushel. Wheat and oat futures prices also fell.    The price swoon appeared to be triggered by some private meteorologists' forecasts of scattered showers and cooler temperatures in some sections of the Midwest over the weekend. &quot;But it's hardly a drought-breaker,&quot; said Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass.    The decline intensified late in the day as reports re-emerged in the trading pits that Congress might consider allowing corn farmers to plant soybeans on land idled under federal price-support programs.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices rebounded from an early round of selling to close slightly higher. Prices declined initially as a follow-through from Wednesday's late sell-off, traders said. The decline triggered further selling by traders and commodity funds that buy or sell futures on the basis of pre-determined price trends, said Alan Bush, a futures analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in Chicago. Prices bounced back as many traders evened up their positions ahead of this morning's release of June employment data, Mr. Bush said.    COTTON: The October contract plunged two cents a pound, its daily limit, and December cotton fell sharply as trading mirrored the activity in grain prices. October cotton closed at 59.73 cents a pound. Cotton for December delivery fell 1.81 cents to 58.59 cents. Recent rains and forecasts of wetter weather this month in U.S. cotton-growing areas also focused traders' attention on forecasts of an abundant crop this year and waning domestic and export demand, analysts said. &quot;The crop's in good shape,&quot; said Stephen W. Platt, senior analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices firmed amid mixed inflationary indicators, as grain prices fell while oil markets rallied. September silver rose 11.5 cents an ounce to $7.02, and August gold climbed 40 cents an ounce to $441.10. &quot;The gold markets are concerned about what's happening in inflation, but our indicators are so crossed and mixed, the market is trying to figure out which way to turn,&quot; said Sharon Ziemian, a precious-metals analyst at Citibank, New York. </TEXT></DOC>
