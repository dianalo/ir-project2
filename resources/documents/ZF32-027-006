(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Copam Inc. Copam B SeriesandM;by Patrick HonanandM;Copam's B Series takes the idea of upgradability as seriously as any of theupgradable PCs in our review group.andP;  Available with CPU boards equipped with16-MHz 386SX, 25- and 33-MHz 386, and 25-MHz 486 processors, the B Seriesdelivers the kind of across-the-board freedom originally promised by thisclass of machine.andP;  The complete interchangeability of Copam's CPU boards isone of the B Series' strongest features.andP;  You will always be able to selectthe right processor for your needs when it's time to upgrade.andM;Copam's B Series consists of the 386SXB-16, 386B-25, 386B-33, and 486B-25,installed with 16-MHz 386SX, 25-MHz 386, 33-MHz 386, and 25-MHz 486 CPUboards, respectively.andP;  We tested all models except the 386B-25.andP;  Copam plansto introduce boards using Intel's 20-MHz 386SX and 50-MHz 486 processors andAMD's 40-MHz 386 processor by the fall.andM;ALL FOR ONEandM;Some manufacturers, like ALR and Dell, put only the processor and coprocessoron the CPU board and leave components such as RAM on the motherboard.andP;  Copamuses a different design that puts the pro-cessor and coprocessor, systemBIOS, CMOS, and RAM on its CPU board.andP;  The only key system elements on themotherboard are the system's one parallel and two serial ports, thefloppy/hard disk controllers, and the SVGA video circuitry.andP;  The system'sexpansion slots reside on a backplane board connnected to the motherboard.andO;The CPU board itself plugs into a proprietary slot on the backplane.andM;This approach makes Copam's CPU boards more expensive than processor-onlyboards.andP;  For example, Copam's 16-MHz 386SX CPU board costs $525, but ALR's16-MHz 386SX board, which bears only the 386SX chip, costs only $395.andP;  Thegap widens considerably between the Copam and ALR 25-MHz 486 CPU boards:$2,679 versus $1,995.andP;  All prices are suggested list prices, and since Copamsells through retailers, buyers can expect significant street discounts,according to Copam.andM;Copam's design makes for more expensive CPU boards but offers a couple ofbenefits in day-to-day use.andP;  For starters, the 386 and 486 systems have a32-bit data path betweeen processor and memory.andP;  On some systems that putmemory on the motherboard, the path is only 16 bits wide.andP;  Granted, most DOSapplications are still written for a 16-bit path, but that will changequickly over the next few years.andP;  Copam's design allows you to take advantageof 32-bit software as it is published.andM;The unit we tested had 4MB of RAM, a 124MB IDE hard disk, two floppy diskdrives, a Super VGA display subsystem, and DOS 4.01.andP;  That configurationcosts $2,338 with the 16-MHz 386SX CPU board, $3,055 with the 33-MHz 386 CPUboard, or $4,492 with the 25-MHz 486 CPU board, with 8MB RAM on each CPUboard.andP;  When you are ready to upgrade, your dealer will decide how muchcredit to allow for your old CPU board, but Copam claims that 50 percent is atypical rebate amount.andM;NO DEALERS FOR DINNERandM;Installing a CPU board in the Series B takes a little work, but it isn't socomplicated that you will want to have your dealer over for dinner.andP;  Becauseeach board contains its own BIOS, there is no need to change the BIOS chip,and there are no jumpers or DIP switches to set.andP;  You will need to unplugseveral wire leads from the CPU board to the speaker and reset button, removeany other boards on the backplane that might block access to the CPU board,slip the board out of the slot, insert the new board, and reconnect thewires.andP;  Each new CPU board requires you to configure its CMOS setupinformation to match the rest of your system's equipment.andM;BABY CASE, BABY EXPANSIONandM;The B in B Series stands for baby-style case, and the unit's 6- by 14- by15.25-inch size clearly lives up to this designation.andP;  Inside, the four16-bit slots are open in the standard configuration.andP;  Adding RAM doesn't takeup any of these slots, since RAM installs in SIMM sockets on the CPU boards.andO;Each CPU board supports a maximum of 16MB of RAM.andP;  There are four half-heightdrive bays, three of which are accessible from the front panel.andP;  The fourthbay, which housed the hard disk in the reviewed machine, resides over thepower supply on the right at the rear of the case.andP;  The hard disk is raisedslightly above the power supply, and Copam claims that a hard disk in thisbay is in no danger of damage from vib-rations or heat generated by the powersupply.andM;Although you can change the processor at any time, you're locked into themodest expansion capabilities of the B Series for as long as you own themachine.andP;  Slots and drive bays that seem ample today may not be two yearsfrom now.andP;  Think hard about what upgrades you are likely to make to thesystem beyond new processors and more RAM.andP;  Those four expansion slots willfill quickly if you add controller boards for a CD-ROM player or tape backupdrive, a modem, fax board, or network adapter board.andP;  Copam is considering anupgradable system in a larger case but has no current plans.andM;PERFORMANCEandM;The B Series delivers average perfor-mance.andP;  Its 33-MHz 386 CPU board comesstandard with a 64K cache of 25-nano-second SRAM.andP;  The same 64K cache is a$119 option on the 25-MHz 386 CPU board.andP;  Copam does not offer a RAM cachefor the 16-MHz 386SX CPU board, and the 25-MHz 486 CPU board contains onlythe 8K RAM cache built into the 486 pro-cessor.andP;  The 19-millisecond IDE harddisk fell into the slower half of the hard disks on PC Magazine Labs' DOSFile Access test.andM;Unlike the hard disk, the Trident chip set with 512K of video RAM turned onone of the fastest screen access times on the benchmark test.andP;  Copamfurnishes motherboard-based 15-pin and 9-pin Super VGA ports that support amaximum resolution of 1,024 by 768 pixels.andP;  The main reason for the inclusionof both types of ports is that the unit is popular in Europe, where 9-pinmonitors are still widely sold.andP;  Nevertheless, it's a nice bonus if you stillhave a 9-pin monitor kicking around although you cannot run two monitorssimultaneously.andP;  You choose which port you're using with a switch mountednear the ports.andP;  Our review unit came with Copam's 1400-30LR, a low-radiationSuper VGA model that supports a maximum resolution of 1,024 by 768.andP;  Allcontrols are located on the front of the unit, and it comes with atilt/swivel stand for easy positioning.andM;The B Series processor performance varied depending on which CPU board wasinstalled.andP;  With the 16-MHz 386 CPU board, the B Series was 0.25 secondsbehind the 16-MHz ALR SX PowerFlex, the only other 16-MHz 386SX systemtested.andP;  It fell in the middle of the pack among 33-MHz 386 systems and wasjust 0.01 second behind the fastest 25-MHz 486 system, the Amkly 486/25.andM;At the time of this review, B Series units with the 16-MHz 386SX and 25-MHz386 CPU boards installed had FCC Class B approval.andP;  According to Copam, ClassB approval is pending on systems with the 33-MHz 386 and 25-MHz 486 CPUboards.andM;Copam backs the system with a one-year warranty on parts and labor.andP;  You'llget free on-site service from TRW during the first year unusual from acompany that sells through retail channels.andP;  Toll-free technical support isavailable from 6:00 A.M.andP;  to 6:00 P.M.andP;  P.S.T.andM;The B Series' expansion capabilities may be too limited if you're looking fora system to pack with boards or disk drives.andP;  Otherwise, the B Series' widespectrum of CPU boards, its relatively painless CPU upgrade procedure, andits reasonable prices make the Copam B Series a solid choice.andM;Copam B SeriesandM;Copam Inc., 45875 Northport Loop E, Fremont, CA 94538; 415-623-8911.andM;Processor and system prices (tested configurations): 386SX/16, $2,338;386/33, $3,055; 486/25, $4,492.andM;Memory and processor RAM cache: 4MB 80-ns.andP;  SIMMs, 64K cache.andM;Disk drives and controller: Seagate 19-ms.andP;  124MB IDE hard disk, 1.2MB and1.44MB floppy disk drives.andM;Display: Trident 512K 1,024-by-768 adapter, Copam 14-inch monitor.andM;Software: DOS 4.01.andM;Processor options: 386/25, $1,190.andM;Copam B SeriesandM;In Short: An average all-round performer, the Copam B Series offers a largeyet somewhat limited assortment of processors at this point, since it lacks a20-MHz 386SX and a 33-MHz 486.andP;  Also, this system's 386 processor ran at 33MHz, compared with the 33.3 MHz typically encountered.andP;  The slightly lowerspeed, however, had little effect on test scores.andP;  The 486/25 configurationwas clocked at 25.2 MHz.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
