ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chairman of the Democratic Partyemphatically rejected today the prospect of a fresh revision of theparty's rules governing its presidential nominating process.   ``I have absolutely no intention to appoint, empower or createany kind of rules commission,'' said Ronald H. Brown.   The party chairman made the statement during a news conferenceat which he announced appointment of party senior staff.   Several party activists, including Robert Beckel, who was WalterMondale's campaign manager in his 1984 presidential try, haveproposed taking a new look at party rules.   While rejecting such suggestions, Brown said he would supportone change: to restore the status of Democratic National Committeemembers as so-called super delegates at the next convention. SuperDelegates are party and elected officials who go to the conventionuncommitted to any presidential candidate and have the potentialfor breaking any deadlock.   At the 1988 convention, the DNC members lost their automaticsuper delegate status to meet a demand from Jesse Jackson.   Named senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee wasJack Martin, a Texan who ran Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's last twore-election campaigns.   The new political director of the DNC will be Paul Tully, whohas close ties to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and who alsoworked on the presidential campaigns of Walter F. Mondale, GaryHart and Michael Dukakis.   Named director of finance was Melissa Moss, who has beenprincipal fund raiser for the Democratic Leadership Council, agroup of elected officials who banded together in 1985 to counterwhat they believed was the leftward drift of the national party.   Continuing as communications director will be Michael McCurry.   In rejecting the idea of another revision of the party's rules,Brown said, ``We don't win or lose election because of rules. ... Ifrankly think if would be foolhardy for this party to spend thenext two years in a bloody and divisive fight over the rules.''   After presidential election defeats in 1968, 1972 and 1980, theDemocrats engaged in sweeping revisions of the party rules. Adfterthe 1984 defeat, the party went through a more modest change.</TEXT></DOC>
