The decline, which followed a revised increase of 4.6% in December, was the largest since the department began keeping the statistics in the current fashion in 1967. The December increase was originally reported as 4.4%.    Car sales had risen 16.1% in December as consumers stepped up purchases of autos and other major items in anticipation of the repeal of the sales tax deduction Jan. 1. Excluding cars, retail sales were down 0.1% last month after rising 1.1% in December.    &quot;Even if you take away autos, things are pretty sluggish,&quot; said Martin Mauro, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York. &quot;Consumers are pulling back a bit.&quot; He said consumer spending has been outpacing income gains for some time.    Robert Ortner, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, suggested that sales were restrained by the unusually bad weather in the East last month. The drop &quot;probably wasn't even as bad as could have happened given the bad weather up and down the East Coast,&quot; he said.    Besides auto sales, weakness appeared in sales at furniture and home furnishing stores, which fell 0.9% in January after being unchanged in December, and in food-store sales, which declined 1.2% after a 0.2% rise.    Gasoline station sales increased 2.3% after a 0.5% drop. Much of this rise likely reflected higher prices, analysts said. Retail sales data aren't adjusted for inflation, although they are adjusted for predictable seasonal variations.    Also, the department's retail sales estimates are based on a relatively small sample of reports and frequently are revised substantially as more data are collected. The numbers exclude spending on services, which accounts for a large portion of consumer outlays.    General merchandise stores showed some strength, according to the January report, with sales rising 0.5% after a 1.7% increase in December. Rosalind Wells, chief economist at J.C. Penney Co., said she expects these sales to hold up this year. &quot;General merchandise seems to grow at a steady pace unless something drastic happens in the economy,&quot; she said.    Sales of building materials rose 0.5% after a 1.8% increase.    Overall, sales of durable goods, which are designed to last three years or more, plunged 14.1% after a 10.2% rise. Sales of nondurable-goods were unchanged after a 1% rise.    Retail sales last month totaled $119.27 billion, down from $126.59 billion in December. Sales were 1.7% above a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
