A sixth activist also was cited for violating Maryland's hunterharassment law but was not taken into custody, Maryland NaturalResources police said.   The activists gathered before dawn near the McKee VeshersWildlife Management Area about 50 miles southwest of Baltimore andtraveled to the state-owned land when hunters began arriving about 5a.m., said organizer Wayne Pacelle of The Fund for Animals.   The demonstrators then broke into groups of five, and each groupfollowed a hunter from the time he stepped from his vehicle, Pacellesaid.   ``We didn't raise our voices but we did let them know in measuredtones we were there to protect the deer and to prevent them fromcruelly killing these animals,'' said Pacelle. ``The hunters dashedthrough the cornfields to escape but generally we stayed with them.''   The activists originally had planned to spread human hair aroundthe tree stands used by bow hunters when they lie in wait for theirprey, but the rainy weather prompted them instead to ``focus onestablishing a presence around the hunter that would deter the deerfrom approaching,'' Pacelle said.   Natural Resources Police Sgt. William Schuller said police andother officials were prepared for the protesters, estimated byPacelle at 60 and police at 40.   No violence was reported.   ``One hunter was pointing an arrow at a group of activistsrepeatedly ... and there were lots of threats of violence butnothing seems to have been done,'' Pacelle said.   Pacelle said the group plans to challenge the state's hunterharassment law on the grounds that it violates the First Amendmentright to freedom of expression. A similiar Connecticut law wasdeclared unconstitutional in a federal court in February 1988, andthat ruling was upheld by a federal appeals court in December 1988,Pacelle said.   First offenders of Maryland's hunter harassment law face fines upto $500.</TEXT></DOC>
