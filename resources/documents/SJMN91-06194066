To ensure she goes undisturbed, there are signs onand in front of the door entreating all comers to &quot;use other door.&quot;;    Therobin appears to be having second thoughts about her decision. She has astartled look in her eyes and ruffles the feathers on her head when someoneapproaches. And since Building 1 is the main entrance to the college, thereare plenty of visitors.;    Don't linger, because mother robin is a nervousbird. And there are more birds to see. But beware. If you visit the otherbirds in the quad above Building 1, consider wearing a hat or taking anumbrella.;    There, dozens of swallows are building mud nests under a ledgeon Building 6.;    And like most new homeowners, they have made deposits.Reynolds said the birds have been dropping more than mud on students who dareto loiter in the quad. She said the swallows get extra busy about 4 p.m. andswarm through the quad to and from the pond in back.;    &quot;It's like a sceneout of 'The Birds,' &quot; she said. &quot;When they swarm out there, someone's bound toget hit.&quot;;    One of the victims, Reynolds reported, was Robert Anglen, aneditor on the campus newspaper.;    &quot;He got splattered . . . and was out ofsorts for a while,&quot; Reynolds said.;    Despite the hazard, the maintenancecrew at Ohlone plans to leave the dozens of nests undisturbed until theswallows migrate away next month.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Dennis Rockstroh column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910712  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  444  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday July 12, 199100194066,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
