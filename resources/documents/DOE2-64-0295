<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-64-0295 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have completed an extensive program to investigate the toxicity---includingmutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic potential---of SRC-I (SolventRefined Coal-I) products, along with selected intermediates and wastematerials, as represented by the SRC-I Design Baseline. The originalprimary objective of the toxicology program was to produce data thatcould be used for four main purposes: to support design of programs toensure workers' health and safety; to help estimate environmental impactsof SRC-I technology; to support the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)premanufacturing notification process for SRC-I technology; and to promotepublic understanding and acceptance of the potential health effects ofthe emerging synfuels industry. The toxicology program consists of fivemain elements: (1) Genetic Toxicity Evaluations; (2) Acute Animal ToxicityEvaluations; (3) Subchronic Animal Toxicity Evaluations; (4) Chronic(life-span) Animal Carcinogenicity Evaluation; (5) Quality Control/QualityAssurance (QC/QA) Monitoring and Evaluation.</TEXT></DOC>
