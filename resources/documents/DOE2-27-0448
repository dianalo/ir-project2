<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-0448 </DOCNO><TEXT>A heterodyne laser spectroscopy system is disclosed. The system utilizeslaser heterodyne techniques for purposes of laser isotope separationspectroscopy, vapor diagnostics, processing of precise laser frequencyoffsets from a reference frequency, and the like. The system comprisesa first, tunable, laser and a second, fixed frequency, laser and meansfor heterodyning the two frequencies the resulting signal being usedto stabilise the first laser to a desired frequency.</TEXT></DOC>
