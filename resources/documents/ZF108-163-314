ShererandM;United Data Corp. next month plans to ship a new tool that company officialssaid lets PC users tap Microsoft Windows as a front end for their companies'mainframe and minicomputer applications.andM;The new tool, ALAC (Any Language Any Computer), lets mainframe-softwaredevelopers write Windows interfaces for host applications without having todelve into Windows' complex application programming interface (API).andM;ALAC's screen-description language replaces the code in a mainframe programthat controls dumb terminals with code that enables the mainframe to sendinterface commands to PCs running Windows, said United Data officials.andM;ALAC uses a run-time module running on the PC to intercept the code andprocess it into Windows API calls.andP;  Because ALAC does the interfaceprocessing on the desktop rather than on the host, the software requires lesshost processing and creates less network traffic than do other protocols,such as the X Window standard, that process interface information on both theworkstation and the host, officials said.andM;ALAC is a Windows port of Apple Computer Inc.'s MacWorkStation, which allowsthe Macintosh interface to be used as a front end for host applications.andO;Since ALAC and MacWorkStation share the MacWorkStation command language,companies can run Mac and Windows terminals from a single mainframe program.andM;&quot;This would let us give our Mac and PC users a graphical user interface, withonly one host application that has to be supported,&quot; said Kime Smith, atechnology consultant with Pacific Bell in San Ramon, Calif.andP;  Pacific Bell isevaluating MacWorkStation and will likely evaluate ALAC as well, Smith said.andM;The MacWorkStaion language is easier to use than either the Macintosh Toolboxor the Windows API, according to Norman Kline, product line manager fornetworking and communications at Apple in Cupertino, Calif.andM;That simplicity, however, can be a drawback.andP;  ALAC supports only simplewindowing interfaces and does not allow development of the more complexinterfaces available by using the Windows API, Smith said.andM;ALAC costs $100 for a one-user development system and $2,500 for a 10-usersite license.andM;United Data can be reached in San Francisco at (415) 221-8931.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
