Exhausted university students began returning to classroomsFriday after staging several marches during a two-week schoolboycott, and campus activists plotted their next steps for thefledgling democracy movement.   Official newspapers prominently displayed a speech by CommunistParty chief Zhao Ziyang that he delivered Thursday, when tens ofthousands of students occupied Tiananmen Square to demand freedomand honest government.   Zhao called for talks with the students, although he did notpromise any meetings with representatives of the pro-democracymovement. Premier Li Peng, in a speech Friday, also said ``thedialogue between the government and the students will continue.''He did not elaborate.   While Li expressed disapproval of ``some actions of somestudents,'' he said many of their demands were in line withgovernment aims, such as bringing an end to corruption, theofficial Xinhua News Agency reported.   Zhao said the protesters ``absolutely don't want to oppose ourbasic system, but demand that we fix maladies in our work.''   He also seemed to tone down earlier official claims thatstudents were being manipulated by people and wanted to see thecountry in turmoil. He said such people were unavoidable but few innumber and said vigilance against them must be maintained. ``Ithink the vast majority of students understand this.''   One student leader at Beijing Normal College acknowledged thesoftening of the authorities' attitude, but claimed Zhao was takinga page from traditional Chinese shadow boxing by ``turningflexibility into strength.''   The state media Friday also gave their fullest accounts yet ofany student protest since the pro-democracy movement began April15. Several newspapers quoted onlookers as saying they supportedthe marchers. They used stories filed by their reporters instead ofXinhua, which has provided only skimpy and understated coverage ofthe student movement.   Press freedom has been a major demand pushed by the students,and among the demonstrators Thursday were scores of journalists whovoiced support for a media free from official control.   After a nearly two-week boycott by students at Beijinguniversities, students returned to class Friday. Others, weary fromsuccessive marches, said they would wait until next week.   A poster put up by the new student union at People's Universitysaid, ``Our efforts of half a month or not wasted. Our classboycott had definite results. Returning to class does not mean wehave ceased our diligence for democracy and for a dialogue'' withthe government.   The union said it chose to end the boycott ``to seek a form ofdialogue that is reasonable and practicle and acceptable to bothsides.''   Xinhua reported more than half the capital's university studentsreturned to class Friday.   Opposition to ending the boycott surfaced at Beijing University,where activists hesitated to order students back to class and a fewwall posters appeared urging the strike to continue.   ``I think we should boycott a while longer,'' said an economicsstudent. ``If we go back to class now then there's no pressure onthe government and it won't recognize our independent union.''   But there were indications democracy movement leaders wereturning to new activities in their young campaign. At People'sUniversity, the new student group put up a poster requesting thereturn of bullhorns issued for the demonstrations.   Hard at work in a fourth-floor Beijing Normal dormitory room wasa student activist reviewing possible new directions for themovement to take such as setting up an independent newspaper,forming ``culture circles'' to hear prominent speakers, conductingsurveys and studying the Chinese constitution.   ``We still have plenty of work to do,'' he said.   The student movement began after the death April 15 of HuYaobang, a reformer who lost his job as party chairman in 1987 whenhe failed to suppress pro-democracy student demonstrations.   About 100,000 people, mostly students, occupied Tiananmen Squareon Thursday after a march through the capital's streets to mark the70th anniversary of China's first student movement and givemomentum to the current wave of pro-democracy activity.   Students participating in that protest and a similardemonstration a week earlier were eagerly supported by tens ofthousands of workers who cheered the marchers and donated money tothe cause.</TEXT></DOC>
