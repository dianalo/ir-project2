The company, which emerged from bankruptcy protection Monday, issetting aside 80 percent of its new stock to help pay the hugeliability bill.   The company is the former Johns Manville Co., which soughtbankruptcy protection in 1982 with about 17,000 pendingasbestos-related lawsuits dating to the 1960s.   As part of a court-approved reorganization, the company helpedestablish the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust. Thebankruptcy court approved the reorganization in December 1986;appeals by various parties delayed the effective date of thereorganization until this week.   The company already has settled an estimated 10,000 lawsuits forabout $500 million. The trust fund is working to clean up theremaining 7,000 that were outstanding at the time of the bankruptcyfiling. It will then take on thousands of claims filed since then.   A second trust, called the Property Damage Settlement Trust,would settle asbestos-related property claims. Manville paid $100million cash into it and the company's insurance carriers also willcontribute millions of dollars.   Asbestos, once regarded as a miracle fiber, was used in scores ofproducts because of its fire retardant qualities before scientistsdiscovered it caused such diseases as asbestosis, lung cancer andmesothelioma.   Manville was the biggest producer, but other asbestos makers anddistributors also have been sued, and many of those firms alsosought bankruptcy protection of their assets.   The Manville trust for personal injury claims is designed to lastfor 27 years.   ``We are in business to compensate all Manville asbestos healthclaimants, including current, known and future victims,'' saidMarianna Smith, executive director of the trust.   ``Asbestos-induced diseases may take up to 30 years to manifestsymptoms, resulting in serious and sometimes fatal results,'' shesaid. ``Although the exact number of claims the trust may receive isunknown, estimates range as high as 200,000.''   Most of the personal injury claimants have been workers in theasbestos industry and in industries such as shipbuilding, where thesubstance was widely used.   About 3,000 victims live in the Philadelphia area, Ms. Smithsaid, which has been a center of asbestos litigation because of theconcentration of shipbuilding and petrochemical industries.   Other regions with the same types of businesses are SanFrancisco, Los Angeles and parts of Texas and Mississippi.   Gene Locks, an attorney who represents more than 5,000 claimants,said most settlements will average around $35,000. Some payoutscould be more than $100,000, Ms. Smith said. The payouts shouldstart in December, probably first to victims in the New Orleans areawhere Manville had a plant.   Locks said he believes ``in excess of $3 billion will beavailable'' to pay victims during the next two to three decades.   The trust is the result of four years of negotiation by lawyersfor claimants, Manville and the federal bankruptcy court in theSouthern District of New York, which permitted Manville to emergefrom Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</TEXT></DOC>
