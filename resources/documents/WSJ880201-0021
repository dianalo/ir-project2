Hancock easily becomes one of the most powerful women in American business.    But she doesn't stand out in a crowd. &quot;If you had a group of 20 women and tried to pick the top IBM executive, she's not the one you'd pick. But get those women talking and you would pick her out in a minute,&quot; says George F. Colony, who is with consultant Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.    With her prematurely gray hair and conservative dress, Mrs. Hancock looks the part of the IBM executive, regardless of gender. A vice president, she has a memory like a beartrap. Those who know her are most impressed with her candor as well as her technical and business savvy. Most importantly, consultants say, as president of IBM's Communications Products Division last year, she was one of the few executives to exceed her 1987 budget projections and has become a protege of powerful IBM executive Terry Lautenbach.    As the newly named general manager of IBM Communication Systems group, Mrs. Hancock, 44 years old, takes responsibility for about $4 billion to $5 billion in revenue from IBM's entire line of telecommunications products. In a recent interview in her office here, she expressed a focused, yet candid, view of the computer giant's telecommunications business.    IBM has had its troubles in telecommunications. Over the past decade, the computer giant poured billions into entering the long-distance transmission business and office switchboard business, only to end up bailing out of long-distance and ultimately buying Rolm Corp. to get office switchboard technology. Integrating Rolm into IBM cost the company a number of talented managers. Only in the last year or so has Rolm gained market share, introducing products compatible with expected advances in phone technology, analysts say.    Mrs. Hancock says IBM still needs to better understand how customers will use new phone technology and emerging world standards called the Integrated Services Digital Network. ISDN, once implemented in phone systems world-wide, will create an all-digital system that mingles voice and data transmission on the same high-speed wires. Last year, she arranged a marketing and development agreement with Network Equipment Technologies Inc., Redwood City, Calif., The NET pact gives IBM access to high-speed multiplexer technology, which increases the efficiency of phone wires, that is becoming critical to large customers building big computer and phone networks.    IBM also has agreements with two makers of phone switches sold to phone companies and with Bell Atlantic Corp., hoping to develop software for phone services a generation beyond the prosaic call waiting and call forwarding. In the process, says Mrs. Hancock, IBM hopes to sell the Bells even more computers and software to manage their networks.    Unlike office switchboards and multiplexer equipment, IBM doesn't see any reason to re-enter the long-distance phone business. The company's 16.5% stake in MCI Communications Corp. is only an investment resulting from IBM's sale to MCI of its satellite long-distance company. &quot;It's not something that obligates us to work with them,&quot; says Mrs. Hancock. Both companies readily agreed to wait until this December before deciding if IBM will take a bigger stake in MCI, under terms of a $400 million credit line promised by IBM to MCI.    In her new job, Mrs. Hancock will run Rolm as well as IBM's communications controller, modem and other data communications businesses. Because she has been so vehement about opening up IBM's networking standards and developing products that work together in networks, analysts expect she will, for the first time since IBM has owned Rolm, integrate those office switches with the rest of IBM's communications gear. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. has made similar recent moves with its own product line.    New product development will likely happen fast. When Mrs. Hancock learned last October that customers wanted software that kept track of the serial numbers of gear hanging on their networks, she ordered the work done. Just last week, IBM announced the new product. &quot;She has been very, very decisive in getting changes made and approved to get products to the customer,&quot; says Richard Sullivan, director of telecommuications systems marketing in the U.S.    Having begun her career as a programmer at IBM in 1966, Mrs. Hancock's technical knowledge is so obvious that the marketing organization kids her about it, says Mr. Sullivan. She is married to W. Jason Hancock, who is on educational leave from IBM, and she didn't seem comfortable with large groups when she first became head of the Communications Products Division, associates say.    Nowadays, however, she's fast on her feet, whether it be a technical or business question. William McGowan, MCI's chairman, recalls a meeting with large customers on the West Coast two years ago. &quot;She had no problem handling the customer groups and that's a tough audience,&quot; says Mr. McGowan. &quot;I don't see any indication that IBM has handed her anything except what she deserves.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Terry Lautenbach Combines Humor and Willingness To Delegate Authority&quot; -- WSJ Feb. 1, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
