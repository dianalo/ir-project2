Year-earlier second-quarter net of the hotel-casino and airline operator was $411,000, or two cents a share, after a $111,000 tax credit. The latest-quarter earnings included a $352,000 tax credit.    Quarterly revenue fell 9.5% to $48 million from $53 million, reflecting the lack of operating revenue from the Sands. MGM Grand said operating results from its Desert Inn Hotel andamp; Casino improved in the period &quot;as a result of increased gaming activity and an improved win percentage.&quot;    Fred Benninger, chairman and chief executive officer, said, &quot;We are pleased with the return on our investment in the Sands. A portion of the proceeds has been used to retire all of our outstanding debt and we are now positioned to focus our attention on the future development of the Desert Inn.&quot; The company acquired Sands and Desert Inn in February 1988.    Operating results of the company's all-first-class airline, MGM Grand Air, also improved, with operating revenue climbing to $7.4 million from $5.7 million. The number of passengers flown during the second quarter increased 16% from the year-earlier period, and the load factor, or percentage of available seats filled, rose to 76% from 62%. Advance reservations increased 23% from last year. The airline flies between New York and Los Angeles.    For the six months, MGM Grand's net jumped to $25.1 million, or $1.20 a share, from $1.3 million, or eight cents a share, a year ago. Latest period net included a $1.8 million tax credit, compared with a $422,000 tax credit a year ago. Revenue rose 25% to $112.5 million from $90.1 million. </TEXT></DOC>
