In the case ofdownloads, there are often cost savings to be had as well.andM;Doing backups in off-hours is fairly common.andP;  In fact, many backup softwarepackages have built-in facilities for unattended backups.andP;  So although thatis a potential application for Complementary Solutions' Automate/Anytime, itmay not be the most common one.andP;  Other applications, where scheduling is notcommonly built into today's software, have more need for this capability.andM;Automate/Anytime lets you set up one or more scheduled execution times eachday, and assign one or more jobs to run at each of those times.andP;  The jobs maybe batch files, keyboard macros, or backup jobs using the software's built-inbackup data compression.andM;The scheduling goes farther than that.andP;  For each job, you can specifyfrequency of execution.andP;  For instance, a batch file that runs yourcommunications software with a script to download Newsbytes' daily editionmight be scheduled for 11:00 p.m., but set to execute only on Monday throughFriday nights.andM;Automate/Anytime also has a &quot;smart dates&quot; capability, which can enter thecurrent system date, or another date calculated relative to the current one(such as seven days earlier than the system date), as required by anotherprogram.andP;  You have some control of the date format.andM;One of the problems with prescheduling jobs is, what happens if the computeris busy?andP;  What if, for instance, you left the office and forgot to exit yourspreadsheet?andP;  Automate/Anytime offers three execution options.andP;  It can be setto swap whatever is currently in memory out to disk, to reboot the system, orto just go ahead and try to run its jobs.andM;One key limitation is that Automate/Anytime does not, at present, work withMicrosoft Windows.andP;  Windows apparently does some odd things with the keyboardthat prevent keystroke macros from working.andP;  Nor do the reboot and swapoptions work with Windows.andM;There are similar problems with Quarterdeck Office Systems' Desqview,although it's not totally impossible to use Automate/Anytime with Desqview.andO;We found that when Automate/Anytime tried to swap Desqview to disk to run itsown jobs it crashed our system -- probably because of Desqview's use ofexpanded memory.andP;  The reboot option worked, but is unsatisfactory if you useany program under Desqview that doesn't save data automatically or complainswhen you restart it after an improper exit.andP;  Lotus 1-2-3 and Agenda fall intothe first category; WordPerfect, among others, is in the second.andM;And Automate/Anytime's keystroke macro facility is of limited value underDesqview because it won't recognize the Alt key as a keystroke unto itself --only combinations with other keys.andP;  The unaccompanied Alt key is used to callup the Desqview menu.andP;  Automate/Anytime is similarly unable to put anunaccompanied Ctrl keystroke into a macro.andM;In testing this program, we had several system crashes the reasons for whichnever became clear.andP;  Conflicts with Desqview accounted for some but not allof them.andP;  In one case, the system locked up on exiting fromAutomate/Anytime's setup menus to DOS.andP;  We suspect the program could be morerobust than it currently is.andM;If problems occur, you may be glad of an audit trail feature which keeps arecord of which jobs are run and when.andM;We have some complaints about this package, and it's fair to say we weredisappointed in some of its capabilities.andP;  But let us add that Newsbytes'Canadian bureau is using Automate/Anytime to run automatic downloadsovernight.andP;  It's not that common that a package we receive for reviewactually gets put into day-to-day use here.andM;PUMA RATING:andM;Performance: 3.andP;  We have some concerns about the robustness of the program.andO;Full compatibility with Windows and Desqview is a sorely felt need.andM;Usefulness: 3.andP;  It depends on your needs and your environment.andP;  If you'rerunning straight DOS, one application at a time, yet have jobs that could rununattended, Automate/Anytime could be really handy.andP;  It would be even moreuseful if it were better adapted to environments such as Desqview andWindows.andM;Manuals: 2.5.andP;  The 50-page manual reads like a rush job and is sometimesconfusing.andP;  The index is very sketchy.andM;Availability: 3.5.andP;  Automate/Anytime is available through an assortment ofmainly smaller distributors.andP;  There is no telephone number specifically forsupport listed in the manual, although the company's main switchboard numberis given.andM;(Grant Buckler/19901024/Press Contact: Jamie Pritchard, ComplementarySolutions, 404-454-8033)</TEXT></DOC>
