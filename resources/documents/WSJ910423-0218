Since the beginning of March, storms roaring down from theGulf of Alaska have inundated many parched sectors of thestate. The storms have dumped as much as five inches of rainand five feet of snow in 24-hour spurts on some parchedareas. More big storms are expected to arrive this weekend.</LP><TEXT>   The rains are welcome relief from several months of nearlybone-dry weather, the worst stretch of a drought that hasgripped California since about 1986. The drought threatens tocost the California economy -- the world's eighth-largest --billions of dollars this year. In the longer term, dry timeshave raised questions about California's water system and itscapacity to keep up with the state's torrid growth.   The storms have damped the water panic that sweptCalifornia in recent weeks, as reservoirs disappeared andcities all over the state adopted or proposed Draconianrationing systems. Gibraltar Reservoir, a small lake nearSanta Barbara, has water in it for the first time since itran dry over a year ago and may soon begin supplying thecommunity with water once more. Orange Cove, a dusty littlefarm town in the San Joaquin Valley where residents werefacing rationing that would have limited them to 10 gallonsof water per household a day -- enough to flush a toilet 1.5times -- now will probably get plenty of water this year.State officials estimate that the storms have added onemillion acre feet of runoff to shriveled lakes and rivers. Anacre foot is 326,000 gallons.   But even with the downpours, rainfall remains at onlyabout 50% of normal levels for the year. Most of the state'smajor reservoirs are still pitifully low. For example, rainshave swollen Shasta Lake, a big federally operated dam andreservoir system on the Sacramento River, by 300,000 acrefeet since late February. It now holds 1.8 million acre feet.Its capacity is 4.8 million acre feet. Hetch Hetchyreservoir, San Francisco's main water source, is currently at12% of capacity; last year at this time, it stood at 25% ofcapacity.   &quot;The situation has gone from god-awful to prettyterrible,&quot; observes Alan Jones, a spokesman for the stateDepartment of Water Resources.   The rains have taken away much of the pressure onCalifornia's new governor, Pete Wilson, to declare a state ofemergency that would have enabled him to transfer water fromfarm users to thirsty cities, regardless of water rights.That is a relief to the governor; such transfers would havebeen politically explosive. Farmers use about 80% ofCalifornia's water.   But state water agencies and the federal Bureau ofReclamation, which control how much water is released frombehind state and federally financed dams in the state, saythey expect to hoard almost all of the storms' runoff torefill reservoirs that have dropped to record lows. That'sbad news for thirsty cities and farm areas, which had hopedthat the storms might mean more deliveries from the state andfederal systems. Earlier this year, the state cut its planneddeliveries to cities by 90% and eliminated plannedagricultural shipments; the bureau, a big farm supplier, hascut most of its farm shipments by 75%.   The rains may mean some scaling back of recently enactedrationing plans in areas that don't rely heavily on state andfederal water projects, but in most cities, water officialsexpect to keep tough conservation measures in place. In SanFrancisco, for example, water department officials say thestorms have given them enough water to proceed with a plan toimpose a 45% rationing plan as of April 1; if it hadn'trained, they might have had to propose even stricter limits.The San Francisco plan is one of the state's toughest: Ifcustomers exceed their limit twice in a row, the cityinstalls a device that automatically restricts water flow. Ifcustomers go over the limit three consecutive times, the cityshuts off their water completely.   Some water officials fear the rains may complicate thefight against drought. The wet weather may erode the sense ofurgency they hoped would compel people to skimp on showers,toilet flushing and lawn watering. &quot;A lot of people may askthemselves why they have to put up with this Draconian waterrationing when their feet are getting soaked as they walkdown the street,&quot; said Cheryl Davis, manager of customerrelations at the San Francisco Water Department, adding,&quot;We're concerned they won't take it as seriously as theyshould.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
