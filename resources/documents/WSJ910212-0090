Judging by these early moves, the newly freecountries are going to be a refreshing breeze on the worldscene. Far from being tortured by the sort of ambivalencethat plagues much of Western Europe, the people of the Eastknow tyranny and oppression when they see them, and they knowhow to react.   Opinion polls indicate that the peoples of Eastern Europeoverwhelmingly support the coalition effort in the Gulf. Someactivists in Hungary tried to start up a peace movement, butthey got nowhere.</LP><TEXT>   Czechoslovakia has been able to sort out the complexitiesof the Middle East. With an early trip to Israel, PresidentVaclav Havel sent important signals of support.Czechoslovakia is sending more than 200 chemical-weaponsexperts to Saudi Arabia to help the coalition forces copewith a possible gas attack. Hungary and Poland have also sentmedical teams. Romania and Bulgaria have backed militaryaction.   Obviously, the nations of Eastern Europe do not have a lotof resources to devote to the Gulf effort. Given the prestigeof those governments, public support is their most importantcontribution. This support has held even amid the body blowsthe Gulf crisis has dealt to their economies. All of thenations were hurt by the initial rise in oil prices.Moreover, many nations of the East had extensive tradingrelations with Iraq. According to a report in the LondonTimes, Poland has lost almost $3 billion in trade because ofthe embargo against Iraq. Bulgarian President Zhelyo Zhelevis facing fierce internal opposition from the leaders of theold regime. They set up extensive trading contacts withSaddam and made large loans. Any hope of getting repayment onthose loans is now slim, but Bulgaria remains committed tothe anti-Saddam effort.   Part of the forthright response is a reflection of thepolitical style in Eastern Europe. Political leaders in thatregion know oppression firsthand. They know what it is likewhen other nations stand idly by while they are beingoppressed. As Czech Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier told usrecently: &quot;We in Czechoslovakia know all about appeasementand its tragic consequences. We are determined to help theworld understand that aggression must be punished.&quot;   This foreign-policy shift represents more than just aswing toward Western ways of operating. Indeed, theWesternized intellectuals who dominated the Mazowieckigovernment in Poland were tepid in their support for theanti-Saddam effort. Eastern Europe, instead, is offering itsown foreign policy, based on its own recent history. Thiswill probably be an important contribution for decades tocome.</TEXT></DOC>
