According to the latest Census Bureau data, the population grew only 0.9% during 1987. That makes the fifth consecutive year that annual growth has been less than 1%. And the rate of growth is the slowest since the late 1930s.    The Census Bureau estimates that there were about 245 million people in the U.S. on Jan. 1, 1988. About 500,000 citizens are living outside the country. The dominant component of population growth is births, with an estimated 3,772,000 children born in the U.S. last year. There has been little change in that number during the past five years.    Offsetting births were an estimated 2,127,000 deaths, a record. That number has been climbing steadily as the U.S. population ages. The smallest component of population growth was immigration. The Census Bureau believes that 600,000 people immigrated to the U.S. last year, a number that has remained fairly constant for the past five years.    Changes in Age Groups;   Changes in Markets   WHILE GENERAL population growth has nearly ground to a halt, there have been considerable changes in the size of selected age groups.    For example, the aging of the baby boomers continues to fuel growth among the middle-aged. Between 1980 and 1986, the 35-to-44-year age group grew 29%, the biggest increase of any group in the six-year period. Beginning in 1987, the growth pattern shifts up to the 45-to-54-year group, which the Census Bureau projects to grow nearly 25% by 1993.    Using such projections, officials in industry and government can anticipate changes in their respective markets. Because people in their 40s, for instance, tend to focus on their families and finances, companies that service those needs have the potential for high sales during the latter part of the 1980s and early 1990s.    At the same time, public schools will be squeezed by the projected increase -- nearly 11% -- in the 5-to-14 age group. And nursing homes will become more crowded as the population aged 75 and older continues to increase -- up 17% in the next six years.    Day-care centers, however, should get some minor relief; the infant population is expected to grow only about 1%.    ---                         Aging Trends   Projected changes in the size of these age groups, 1987-1993:   AGE GROUP                                     % CHANGE   Under 5                                         + 0.7%   5-14                                            +10.9   15-24                                           - 9.9   25-34                                           - 2.9   35-44                                           +17.6   45-54                                           +24.7   55-64                                           - 4.8   65-74                                           + 6.1   75 and older                                    +17.1   Source: American Demographics   Measuring Differences   In Spending Patterns   ESTIMATES of population growth and age are useful in planning marketing strategies, but so is knowledge of spending patterns.   The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes results from the Consumer Expenditure Survey which, when used with estimates of growth in certain age groups, helps to identify promising -- and not-so-promising -- markets.   For example, in 1985, the latest year for which survey results are available, households headed by individuals under the age of 35 spent more on rent than any other type of household. With the number of these households declining by 8% between now and 1995, the rental housing market is likely to be stagnant for several years.   On the other hand, people between the ages of 35 and 54 consume more reading materials than any other age group. Thus, the market for books and magazines should continue to be strong throughout the decade. But, because people who buy magazines on the newsstand tend to be younger, newsstand sales may falter while subscription sales of periodicals take off.   Disparities Widen   In Regional Income   AFTER CONVERGING for more than 50 years, differences in regional income are widening again.   Nationally, per capita income stood at $14,641 in 1986, reflecting average growth of 7.1% a year since 1979. But recent estimates from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show the Great Lakes and Plains states lagging behind the nation, with increases of 6.4% and 6.6% respectively. The causes: stagnation in the areas' traditional manufacturing base and low population growth, which reduces consumer demand.   Meanwhile, per-capita income in New England and the Middle Atlantic states has pulled ahead of the rest of the country despite slow population growth in these regions. In New England, income rose about 9% a year; in the Middle Atlantic, it rose about 8%. In the Southwest and Far West, total personal income has risen at a rate comparable to that in the Northeast. But because population in the Western regions is growing twice as fast as the nation as a whole, per capita income is rising more slowly.   The Rocky Mountain states, beset by problems in agriculture and the oil industry, saw below-average gains in both total personal income and per capita income, even though their average annual population growth of 1.7% was well above the 1% national growth rate.</TEXT></DOC>
