Brean Murray, Blyth, located here,  is the onlymajor database developer that actively markets itself as a consulting andtraining firm for its own products.andM;That troubles many Omnis 5 consultants and trainers.andM;David Swain, author of &quot;Unlocking Omnis 3andplus;&quot; and president of PolymathBusiness Systems of Alameda, Calif., claimed that since Blyth started itsauthorized Omnis trainer program last summer, the company has beendiscouraging Omnis customers from using independent trainers like himself.andM;&quot;They are discrediting me with my prospective clients,&quot; Swain said.andM;Larry Barcot, president of Escape, an Omnis consultant in Costa Mesa, Calif.,andO;corroborated Swain's story, saying one of his clients was told by Blyth thatSwain was &quot;incompetent&quot; when the client called to check on Swain'squalifications.andM;Murray denied knowledge of any independent trainer being panned by hiscompany and said that he thought Swain's courses were &quot;top-quality.&quot;andM;Even those who paid $5,000 to become authorized Omnis trainers hadcomplaints.andM;&quot;Out of seven people who became trainers, five got one class out of the deal.andO;The other two got none, although Blyth has been running weekly trainingclasses in its own facility with its own people,&quot; claimed Gary Conner, vicepresident, technical services at DirectLine Technologies Inc. of Modesto,Calif.andP;  &quot;I never got the follow-up business I was promised when I took theclass.&quot;andM;Omnis consultants also complained about competition from the company.andM;&quot;Blyth is out there taking consulting jobs, so if I were a consultant, I'd beconcerned,&quot; said Bill Schjelderup, president of COMPanion Consulting Corp. ofSalt Lake City, an Omnis developer.andP;  Schjelderup formerly was director ofsupport services at Blyth and is a board member of Macintosh ConsultantsNetwork.andM;Doug Easterbrook, partner at AccuWare Ltd., an Omnis developer and trainer inCalgary, Alberta, said what really concerned him were the ever-changinglicensing rules that affect Omnis developers' business plans.andM;With Omnis 5 Integrator, Omnis developers can create an optimized version oftheir application that runs from a custom icon.andP;  For the old Integrator,taken off the market last April, developers paid a $3,000 one-time fee and a$1,000 yearly renewal fee that licensed them to use an unlimited number ofapplication copies.andP;  For the new Integrator, available this month, developerspay $500 and then $30 to $80 for each application copy.andM;&quot;I don't mind buying a general license or paying a minor unit fee, but howcan I stay competative paying a major fee?&quot; Easterbrook commented.andM;&quot;Omnis is an outstanding product.andP;  The real problem is the lack of competentleadership that understands the product is driven by its independentdevelopers,&quot; said Will Tompkins, president of Profitware, a San Diego-basedconsulting firm and longtime Omnis developer.andM;Despite the complaints, Murray denied that Blyth's policies are unfair.andM;&quot;When changes occur, there are some people who don't understand what'shappening,&quot; said Murray.andP;  &quot;People have to get in line with the future.andO;What's past is past.&quot;andM;But others said they saw it differently.andM;&quot;andlsqb;Blyth isandrsqb; doing these things to absolutely maximize andlsqb;itsandrsqb; profits,&quot; saidBarcot.andP;  &quot;It's andlsqb;Blyth'sandrsqb; opinion that developers don't sell product.andP;  andlsqb;Blythisn'tandrsqb; out to kill us; andlsqb;itandrsqb; just wants all the money we make off Omnis.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
