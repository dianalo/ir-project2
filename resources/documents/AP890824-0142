The once inconceivable change for Eastern Europe came about notthrough revolution but in an orderly parliamentary vote, withCommunist Party members joining Solidarity deputies to elect thejournalist and former political prisoner 378-4 with 41 abstentions.   It was the first non-Communist government to be seated in Warsawsince 1944.   Among the first to celebrate was Solidarity chief Lech Walesa,who engineered the coalition that gave Mazowiecki a solid majorityin parliament and then got Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelskito go along with the deal.   ``I will do everything so that my premier, my child ... passesthe test before society,'' pledged a jubilant Walesa in Gdansk afterwatching Mazowiecki's election on television. He wished Mazowieckisuccess in ``transforming our country from a totalitarian system todemocracy.''   Congratulations also arrived from President Bush and from theprime minister of Communist East Germany, one of the leastreform-minded countries in the East bloc.   The Soviet Union, for whom Poland is the largest and moststrategic Warsaw Pact ally, greeted the election with equanimity.   ``We shall regard Comrade Mazowiecki as our partner in therelations that link our two countries,'' said Foreign Ministryspokesman Yuri Gremitskikh in Moscow.   The Soviet Union invaded Hungary in 1956 and led an invasion ofCzechoslovakia in 1968 to maintain orthodox Communist rule.   But Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev now rejects interferingin the affairs of his allies and Moscow's political analystsapparently believe a government under Solidarity is Poland's besthope for stability.   Members of every party, including the Communists, joined in tosupport Mazowiecki and the election was greeted by a standingovation. First the Solidarity deputies stood, then members of minorparties and finally the entire communist delegation.   A solemn-looking Mazowiecki rose and gave a long bow to thechamber.   ``I am very touched at this moment. I thank you ... for thisgreat proof of trust,'' he said, urging that they ``raise up Polandtogether.''   After his election, Mazowiecki met for a half-hour with Gen.Jaruzelski at the president's office and sipped champagne with thestaff of his former newspaper, the weekly Tygodnik Solidarnosc,before facing journalists at a packed news conference.   ``I can see a green light for Polish hope, which our nation mustlight for itself by fighting above all for something _ fordemocratic (and) economic changes _ above all for something and notagainst someone,'' he told reporters.   After the news conference, Mazowiecki said, he planned twotelephone calls: first to Polish-born Pope John Paul II, his friend,and then to Walesa.   He said he want to assemble a Cabinet within the next week andwould seek participation by all the parties in parliament, includingthe Communists. But he refused to be specific about how many postsfor each.   The Solidarity-led coalition committed itself in advance togiving the key ministries of defense and internal affairs, withcontrol of the army and police, to the Communist Party. Mazowieckiindicated Wednesday he would find other posts for Communists as well.   But he told Communist deputies before the vote that it would makeno sense for Solidarity to form a government with just the primeministry and a few minor ministries.   After Mazowiecki's election, 15 Communist Party parliamentdeputies on behalf of the party's caucus submitted a proposal todrop from the constitution a clause that mandates the CommunistParty be the ``leading political force'' in society.   Mazowiecki will have to wrestle with daunting economic troubles,including a $39 billion foreign debt, inflation climbing toward 200percent annually and empty store shelves.   He said he would seek economic support from the West but nospecial ``privileges'' while trying to unlock the dormant energiesof Poles.   Mazowiecki said he will support Poland's East bloc treatyobligations, telling a questioner pointedly that it was wrong toidentify ``people striving for reforms'' as ``enemies of the WarsawPact.''   ``I want to form a government capable of acting for the good ofsociety, the nation and the state,'' Mazowiecki told the Sejm.   His speech stressed the need to restore ``normal'' political andeconomic life to Poland, including transition of power betweenpolitical parties and a market-oriented economy.   The state ``cannot take care of everything and guaranteeeverything,'' he said. ``Poland cannot afford ideologicalexperiments any longer.''   His election came barely 15 months after he and Walesa led adisappointed group of strikers out of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdanskwithout winning any of their demands, the end to a nationwide waveof labor unrest in April and May 1988.   The strike, followed by a bigger strike wave in August, persuadedauthorities to renew a dialogue with Solidarity, which waseventually legalized in April and won 260 of 261 seats it contestedin June parliamentary elections.   Mazowiecki recalled that strike defeat Thursday.   ``I think that neither them nor I thought that exit would lead tomy entrance here today,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
