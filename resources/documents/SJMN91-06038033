DonPromes still is on the job doing the less glamorous yet crucial job of siftingthrough the blackened debris.;    Promes continued searching Wednesday forclues at the site of Sunday's probable arson fire that did an estimated $5million in damage to a condominium complex under construction at StevensonBoulevard and Leslie Street, just east of Fremont Boulevard.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO ITARSON INVESTIGATION CAN BE A DIRTY JOB  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Police arrested Jeffrey Scott Ferreira, 25, of Fremont on Monday afterwitnesses reported seeing him at the construction site minutes before thefire. He was released Tuesday after the Alameda County District Attorney'soffice refused to file charges, citing insufficient evidence.;    In thisparticular fire, the abundance of debris makes it difficult to investigate,Promes said.;    But after the demolition crew removes the debris, fire enginecrews will hose down the surface of the concrete foundation. Then, Promesshould be able to locate which area has the most damage and determine wherethe fire originated. Initial reports indicate the fire began in a stairwell ina center condominium.;    After Sunday's fire was out, the first thing Promesdid was wander around the least damaged area.;    &quot;You start from there andthen move into the area of greater damage,&quot; he said. &quot;It tells you where afire hasn't traveled.&quot;;    To rule a fire as arson, Promes must firstdetermine that it was not ignited accidentally.;    None of the electricalwiring had been installed at the construction site and there was no gas orpower on of any kind, he said. Nothing was found to indicate anything was usedto accelerate the fire that destroyed 39 condominiums under construction.;   But Promes admits that it could be difficult to prove arson.;    &quot;You almosthave to see the person with a heat source starting the fire,&quot; he said.;    Atthe construction site, a demolition crew plodded through piles of charredwood, twisted scaffolding and other burned remnants while Promes stood by,directing and observing.;    &quot;I have to make sure they don't throw away anyvaluable evidence,&quot; Promes said.;    As chief investigator of the fire, Promesonly leaves the area at night. Then, private security guards arrive to watchthe scene until he returns again at 7 a.m.;    &quot;Once I get a case I follow itthrough its conclusion,&quot; said Promes, who spent almost 24 hours there afterthe fire broke out.;    Most of the time, Promes just observes, occasionallyraking and shoveling the debris and handling fallen beams and scraps of wood.;   &quot;This part of the job can get boring,&quot; Promes concedes. &quot;But you take thegood and the bad.&quot;;    Promes expects to finish his investigation within thenext few days. And he's relieved.;    &quot;I'm tired,&quot; he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SANDRA GONZALES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910207  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  503  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday February 7, 199100038033,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
