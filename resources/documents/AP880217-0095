Kohl left for Washington today for the three-day visit that willinclude talks with President Reagan, Secretary of State George P.Shultz and leading members of Congress.   The opposition Social Democratic party called on the chancellorto press for a reduction in short-range nuclear missiles in centralEurope during the Washington talks.   ``The chancellor should work toward a concept for the withdrawalof short-range missiles,'' the party's arms control expert, KarstenVoigt, was quoted by the Neuen Osnabruecker newspaper as saying.   In recent days, West German government officials have pointedout differences of opinion on these topics and urged the NATOalliance to develop an overall arms control strategy beforepursuing new talks with the Soviet Union.   ``Before we sit at the table with the Soviets on new(disarmament) proposals, we need to have agreement within the(NATO) alliance on overall strategy,'' a top-ranking West Germanofficial told reporters Tuesday.   Officials said Kohl is likely to press for a worldwide ban onchemical weapons.   U.S. officials have said it would be difficult to verify such aban, but West German experts contend that verification problems canbe worked out.   ``We think the (East-West) chemical weapons talks have reached apoint where it is possible to reach an agreement this year,'' saidthe West German official, who spoke on condition that he not befurther identified.   The official said West Germans are aware that U.S. arms controlnegotiators are emphasizing working out reductions in strategicnuclear weapons and don't feel that the Geneva-based chemicalweapons talks are on the brink of agreement.   ``But it is important for us to represent our European interestswithin the (NATO) alliance,'' he added.   Short-range nuclear missiles, or those with a range of less than300 miles, are expected to be a main point of Kohl's talks inWashington. U.S. officials in recent weeks have emphasized theimportance of implementing a 1983 NATO decision to upgrade theshort-range nuclear weapons in central Europe.   U.S. and other NATO officials have said the short-range missilesare now more important to the alliance because of last December'ssuperpower arms treaty which, if ratified, will scrap allland-based, medium-range missiles.   But the West German government says NATO must first developoverall arms control strategies and insists on reductions in Sovietsuperiority in conventional arms before upgrading the alliance'sshort-range missiles.   ``The Federal Republic (of Germany) sees no need for an isolateddecision on modernizing or not modernizing particular nuclearweapon systems at this point,'' Friedhelm Ost, chief governmentspokesman, said Monday.   ``Such decisions should be taken only after new overall(disarmament) concepts are worked out,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
