The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a reportreleased Thursday, reiterated its conclusion that most incidents inwhich cars suddenly lurched forward or backward at full speed werecaused by drivers putting their feet on the wrong pedals.   But the safety agency report also said recalls involving 1978through 1986 models were necessary for safety of the Audi 5000 andother models. Audi's U.S. sales plummeted after a major 1986 recall.   Audi recall campaigns to modify the accelerator and brake pedalson 1978 through 1983 models, install automatic shift-lock systems inall models, and correct idle speed control systems in 1984 through1986 models ``appear to have resulted in a very substantialreduction of the number of sudden acceleration incidents andaccidents,'' the report said.   Further reductions are expected as more vehicles have the recallwork completed and older cars which do not have the work done arescrapped, NHTSA said.   Some drivers had complained the West German-made Audi,distributed by Volkswagen of America, would suddenly accelerate whenit was shifted out of park into drive or reverse.   In February, the traffic safety agency concluded after ayear-long study that most such events in Audis and other cars arecaused by drivers pushing the gas pedal when they think they werepushing the brake.   But the safety agency said this does not mean drivers are alwaysat fault and design flaws may be to blame.   The report said the frequency of wrong-pedal incidents appears toincrease because of the location and ``possibly the feel of thecontrol pedals and by problems involving unexpectedly fast engineidle speed which could startle drivers at inopportune times.''   Audi has had seven recalls since 1982. The major one in 1986called back 250,000 of the 5000-series automobiles to install theautomatic shift-lock which prevents the transmission from being putinto forward or reverse without the brake pedal being depressed.   The report said this recall campaign was ``an effective practicalcountermeasure'' and other recalls also were necessary.   Hans-Jorg Hugerland, Volkswagen of America president, said thereport ends a ``grievous period'' for the company, which has longmaintained that sudden acceleration was not caused by a mechanicalproblem.   ``Now, at long last, that result is official and the case isclosed,'' Hugerland said.   Hugerland also said installation of the shift-lock device causedcomplaints of ``unintended acceleration, real or imagined'' to drop90 percent.   U.S. sales of Audis dropped from more than 200 a day before the1986 recall to 60 a day for the 1989 models in the first five monthsof this year.</TEXT></DOC>
