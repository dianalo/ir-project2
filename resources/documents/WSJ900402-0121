This latest effort to ease trade restrictions against thechanging Eastern bloc will give the Commerce Department soleauthority to license such exports. That is bound to make iteasier and faster for some U.S. companies to markettechnology in those areas that is already available fromother sources. Pentagon officials said that the decisionwon't affect shipments of more sophisticated, powerful orhigh-tech equipment, which will continue to be reviewed byboth agencies.</LP><TEXT>   But the move highlights the erosion of Defense Departmentinvolvement and influence in trade matters.   Since last summer, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney hasfought and lost a series of internal administration tussleswith Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher over restrictingcomputer sales and other U.S. exports to the Soviets and Eastbloc customers. The Commerce Department has prevailed inadvocating less stringent rules, and even top Pentagonofficials now concede that the Western alliance'slongstanding system of export controls is in danger ofcollapsing under the weight of the rapid changes in East-Westrelations.   Regardless of what the U.S. does, Secretary Cheney hastold reporters, &quot;the Soviets will find it easier over thenext few years to acquire Western technology.&quot; He and othersin the Pentagon have argued that export controls should berelaxed on a country-by-country basis, as freely electedEastern European governments come into power and sever tiesto Soviet intelligence.   But such a two-tier control system, Mr. Cheney hasacknowledged, is likely to be full of loopholes. The latestannouncement, for instance, didn't make any distinctionsbetween Soviet or Eastern European shipments.   In the face of pressure from U.S. industry and Europeanallies, the Bush administration less than two months agoagreed to work with 16 other industrialized nations to easecontrols covering shipments of a range of machine tools,telecommunications equipment and smaller computers to theEast bloc. But after that meeting, Secretary Cheney continuedto advocate a go-slow approach. &quot;I worry about the situationin which 10 years from now the Soviet Union is governed bysomeone&quot; more belligerent toward the U.S., he told a businessgroup recently.   Reducing Pentagon review of export licenses is expected toprovide a boost to companies eager to tap into the lucrativemarket for certain widely used mainframes, desktop computersand standard switching equipment for telephone systems. Inthe past, Pentagon officials maintained that even certainkinds of personal computers could provide the Soviet'sindustry and military with powerful new tools.   Industry and Commerce Department officials have arguedthat lengthy U.S. reviews often caused American companies tolose sales to Western European and Japanese competitors.</TEXT></DOC>
