Black activists said at least 25 people were killed in clasheswith police during protests of the elections Wednesday, from whichblacks were excluded.   The governing National Party narrowly retained its parliamentarymajority in the balloting, losing nearly a quarter of its seats inthe dominant white chamber t anti-apartheid and hard-linesegregationist parties.   With votes counted in all of 166 election districts, it appearedthe Nationalists would retain at least 93 of their previous 123seats in Parliament.   The Conservatives, who want stricter enforcement of segregationlaws and oppose any political rights for blacks, improved from 22 to39 seats.   The Democratic Party, which seeks an end to apartheid laws butwants some guarantees that whites and other minorities would retaina voice in the government, went from 20 seats to 33 seats. The jumpwas the biggest ever for an anti-apartheid faction.   In one rural district, officials announced another election wouldbe held to settle a tie between Conservative and National Partycandidates.   Protesting their disenfranchisement, blacks on Wednesday observeda nationwide general strike that anti-apartheid leaders called thebiggest anti-government protest ever with 3 million people takingpart.   Violence flared in many black and mixed-race areas around CapeTown and white riot police were seen marching through townshipsfiring in all directions.   Cape Town attorney Essa Moosa said 25 black and mixed-race peoplehad been killed in violence in seven townships.   Police said 12 deaths occurred in the Cape Town area: sevenduring violence associated with a feud between factions in the blacktownship of Khayelitsha, and five during mob violence of unknownorigin in three mixed-race townships.   Police said four police officers were slightly injured and thatmore than 50 people were arrested.   ``Mr. de Klerk's president's seat sits now in a pool of blood,''said Rev. Allan Boesak, a mixed-race anti-apartheid activist in CapeTown. ``People who begin a new term of office with a massacre of ...people have no right to be in government.''   Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the 980,000-member Congress ofSouth African Trade Unions and a leader of the defiance campaign,called the police response to the protests ``brutal'' and said ofthe government: ``They have to deal with us as human beings andrespect our dignity and sense of justice or there will not be anypeace in our country.''   Alfred Mzo, secretary-general of the outlawed African NationalCongress guerrilla group, praised the huge opposition to theelections and said the group's call for a boycott resulted in lowturnout among mix-race and Indian voters.   ``Of historic significance for the future of South Africa is themassive challenge of the oppressed working people who in theirmillions stayed away from work as a massive protest against theundemocratic nature of the elections,'' he said during newsconference today in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, where he was attending asummit of non-aligned nations.   Hospitals and monitoring groups said more than 100 people werehurt as riot squads used whips, tear gas and shotguns to stoppeaceful anti-election rallies and disperse stone-throwing crowds inmore than 20 townships.   Archbishop Desmond Tutu said he had warned Western nations thatthere would be ``chaos in South Africa'' and urged them to actagainst the government. He said de Klerk should condemn the policeactions and ``express sorrow and condolences to people who havesuffered this bereavement.''   De Klerk, who is expected to be chosen by an electoral collegenext week to serve a five-year term as president, described theelection results as ``a clear mandate'' for his party's plans forgradual political reform and said the government now should opennegotiations with blacks.   ``Seventy percent of the whites voted for parties favoringrenewal and reform ... and granting political rights,'' he saidtoday, linking his party with the liberal-minded Democrats.   During the campaign, de Klerk had associated the Nationalistswith the right-wing Conservatives, saying that in the 1987 whiteelection 80 percent of voters had shown a preference for thoseparties' promises to enforce segregation.   De Klerk's campaign platform called for limited blackparticipation in national politics within five years. However, herejects a one-person, one-vote system leading to black majority ruleand supports maintaining segregated schools and and neighborhoods.   ``The implementation of a comprehensive economic action plantogether with political development will get our country on the roadof prosperity again,'' de Klerk told a news conference.   However, he would not answer a question about how the governmentwould begin negotiations after the tough police action againstblacks during five weeks of protests leading up to the election.   ``The government handled the defiance campaign with aplomb and ina very reasonable way,'' de Klerk said.   Of South Africa's 37 million people, 5 million are white, 28million black, about 3 million of mixed race and nearly 1 million ofIndian descent. Under apartheid, blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.   About 69 percent of the 3,160,667 registered white voters castballots in the election and, for the first time since 1953, theNationalists received less than a majority of the white vote. Theywon 48.6 percent, to 31.3 percent for the Conservatives and 20percent for the Democrats.   Also at stake were seats in Parliament's the mixed-race andIndian chambers, which were established in 1984 and have littlepower. Anti-apartheid activists also called for a boycott of thenon-white elections.   Incumbents won most races, but National Party candidatesgenerally fared worse than in the white election of 1987.   Two prominent Cabinet members, Foreign Minister Pik Botha andDefense Minister Magnus Malan, were re-elected by margins sharplylower than 1987.   The Conservatives lost by only five votes in Vereeniging, deKlerk's former district. They failed to win some seats they hadtargeted and fell far short of the 50 to 60 seats they had expected.   But they won their first seats in Pretoria, the capital, nd theirfirst seats in Cape Province and the Orange Free State. Previously,they held seats only in Transvaal, the most populous of the fourprovinces.</TEXT></DOC>
