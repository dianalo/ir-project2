Insider trading or canny investing?    It's the kind of question most companies would prefer not to discuss. But last week Waste Management Inc. outlined details of just such a situation. A special committee of three outside Waste Management directors, faced with a stockholder lawsuit in Delaware chancery court alleging insider trading, investigated 19 purchases of ChemLawn Corp. stock by Dean L. Buntrock, Waste Management's chairman and chief executive, his family and three other company executives. In all, the Waste Management executives bought 45,000 ChemLawn shares over two years, while intermittently discussing acquiring ChemLawn.    Ultimately, in February 1987, Waste Management bid for -- and lost -- the Columbus, Ohio, lawn-care concern. But the executives came out winners; they sold their ChemLawn holdings during the next two months for a combined profit of close to $1 million.    The special committee's verdict: The executives were simply sharp investors. In its report, filed in the Delaware chancery court, the committee says it based its decision on a legal reading of one of the murkiest areas of securities law: When do companies' internal deliberations on a prospective tender reach a point where they can influence the market?    (The Wall Street Journal last year filed a motion in an unrelated case seeking some of the documents referred to in the special committee's report.)    Federal securities law says an insider-trading violation occurs once &quot;any person has taken a substantial step or steps to commence, or has commenced, a tender offer,&quot; according to rule 14e-3 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act. But the law doesn't spell out clearly what those &quot;steps&quot; could be, allowing for sharply different opinions on the matter.    &quot;You look for the bright line beyond which you should not trade,&quot; says Wallace Timmeny, a former deputy director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division who was hired by Waste Management's special committee to lead the investigation of the insider trading allegations. Mr. Timmeny, now in private practice in Washington, is frequently hired by corporate boards in such situations. That &quot;bright line,&quot; he says, is a company's formal concensus to go after an acquisition. Mr. Timmeny says that individual traders within a company may reach that line before the company itself. But Waste Management's executives, he says, never crossed it.    Others say the line isn't quite so clear. David A. Sirignano, who heads the Securities and Exchange Commission's office of tender offers, says there are two camps: Those who sanction inside corporate stock deals right up to the board's decision to bid, and those who say the line could come much earlier than a formal determination to proceed with the offer.    &quot;Our position is the latter,&quot; Mr. Sirignano says.    &quot;This is a fuzzy area,&quot; adds Donald C. Langevoort, a securities-law expert and visiting professor at Harvard Law School. &quot;But if I were a juror there are a lot of things I would consider significant before the price and structure of a deal were firmed up.&quot;    Some of the issues may be clarified when the Supreme Court rules in a pending stockholder case against Basic Inc., a unit of Stamford, Conn.-based Combustion Engineering Inc. Shareholders accused Basic in 1979 of falsely denying that merger talks were under way between the two companies -- nearly a year after they began. The case touches on the question of when preliminary negotiations become material, a point that the SEC's Mr. Sirignano calls &quot;an important issue&quot; in clarifying insider-trading rules.    The SEC won't say whether it is investigating Waste Management's bid for ChemLawn. But the following chronology shows the difficulty of defining just what constitutes insider trading. Taken from the special committee's report, it gives a behind-the-scenes look at executives alternately tending to their employer's finances -- and their own:   1985   MARCH 13: Jerry E. Dempsey, Waste Management's vice chairman, completes a broad study on potential acquisition candidates, including ChemLawn, as part of a possible diversification plan. Mr. Buntrock says he reviewed it. A presentation is made to the board.    MAY 8: Mr. Buntrock buys 100 shares of ChemLawn for his personal account &quot;to receive shareholder reports.&quot; On this day, he also buys 100 shares of 28 different companies for the same purpose, and larger stakes in 15 other companies.    1986   JAN. 29: Mr. Buntrock sends to James E. Koenig, assistant to Waste Management's chief financial officer, Value Line and Standard andamp; Poor's reports on ChemLawn and asks for his comment. Mr. Koenig responds that ChemLawn looks like &quot;a good short-term play.&quot; Mr. Buntrock later replies that Waste Management, &quot;as a matter of policy did not purchase securities to speculate.&quot; Mr. Buntrock makes a note to himself to tell his wife, Rosemarie Buntrock, to buy some ChemLawn stock.    JAN. 31: Mr. Buntrock purchases 900 ChemLawn shares. Mrs. Buntrock, who -- both she and her husband acknowledge -- buys stocks on her husband's orders, acquires 2,000 ChemLawn shares. Mr. Koenig buys 400 ChemLawn shares.    JULY 8: Mrs. Buntrock buys 2,000 ChemLawn shares.    JULY 9-11: Waste Management holds its annual strategic planning meeting at the Buntrocks' summer home in Wisconsin, beginning with cocktails and dinner the evening of July 9. &quot;Acquisitions outside the solid-waste industry are not (repeat NOT) discussed at the . . . meeting,&quot; according to the committee's report. And none of those present &quot;could recall any discussions -- formal or informal -- regarding ChemLawn.&quot;    On July 9, Mrs. Buntrock buys 2,000 ChemLawn shares. Peter Huizenga, a Waste Management vice president, secretary and director, also buys 2,000 ChemLawn shares. He says he made the purchase after Mrs. Buntrock, who &quot;maintains an office at the company's headquarters adjacent to Mr. Huizenga's,&quot; came into his office and mentioned that she was considering buying ChemLawn stock. (Mrs. Buntrock denies this.)    On July 10, Mrs. Buntrock buys 2,000 ChemLawn shares.    JULY 15-16: Mrs. Buntrock buys 1,000 ChemLawn shares. Two Buntrock family trusts buy a combined 4,000 shares of ChemLawn. Mr. Huizenga buys 2,000 ChemLawn shares.    SEPT. 11: Mrs. Buntrock buys 10,000 ChemLawn shares.    SEPT. 12: Two Buntrock family trusts buy a combined 6,000 shares. Mr. Buntrock says he can't recall why shares were bought in this month, except that the trusts had an excess of cash around that time. Sometime during September, Mr. Buntrock and Gerald E. Seegers, president of the company's Waste Management Partners Inc. subsidiary, discuss another acquisition effort and the potential acquisition of ChemLawn comes up in their discussion.    OCT. 6: Perry Lewis, an investment banker with Morgan, Lewis, Githens andamp; Ahn in New York, sends Mr. Buntrock a Smith Barney research bulletin on ChemLawn. The report also goes to Mr. Dempsey, Waste Management's vice chairman. Mr. Buntrock doesn't recall any prior talks with Mr. Lewis that &quot;would have prompted&quot; the letter, though he says &quot;it is possible&quot; the two might have previously discussed ChemLawn. Mr. Lewis says he had discussed ChemLawn with Mr. Buntrock before -- &quot;as one of the 25 or 30 companies (Waste Management) was interested in monitoring.&quot; Mr. Lewis says he had previously offered to introduce Mr. Buntrock to ChemLawn management but says ChemLawn was &quot;back-burnered&quot; because its price was &quot;astronomical.&quot;    OCT. 15: Mr. Buntrock buys 3,000 ChemLawn shares, raising his family's stake to 33,000 shares. He doesn't recall why he made the purchase, though he says it &quot;could have been prompted by Mr. Lewis's letter.&quot; However, Mrs. Buntrock says the purchase could have been made by her on a weeks-old instruction from her husband. She often doesn't immediately buy stock, she says, &quot;because the stock market is one of her lowest priorities.&quot;    OCT. 16: Mr. Dempsey buys 1,000 ChemLawn shares. He and Mr. Buntrock say they didn't discuss Mr. Lewis's letter with each other or anyone else.    OCT. 20: Phillip B. Rooney, Waste Management's president, sends Mr. Buntrock a memo saying: &quot;Should we introduce the ChemLawn idea at the Oct. 31 board meeting? We shouldn't wait too long before moving forward if we want to buy the company.&quot; Mr. Rooney says &quot;the ChemLawn idea&quot; and buying &quot;the company&quot; were intended to be &quot;generic references to the lawn-care industry&quot; -- much like saying Coke for soft drinks, Kleenex for tissue, and Xerox for copying.    (The Waste Management special committee, in its conclusions, says the memo, &quot;taken alone, and read literally, is problematic. It is clear, moreover, that ChemLawn and its trading discount had come to the attention of individuals within senior management by October 1986, and that such individuals considered ChemLawn specifically to be a possible acquisition candidate if (Waste Management) ever decided to expand into the lawn-care industry.&quot; The report also states that: &quot;Other interviewees told the committee that they personally considered ChemLawn to be a specific acquisition candidate if for no other reason than that it was a leader in the lawn-care industry.&quot;)    OCT. 27: Mr. Dempsey buys 1,000 ChemLawn shares. Agendas for the Oct. 31 board meeting are distributed. ChemLawn appears on the agenda under the heading &quot;pending acquisitions,&quot; along with five other companies.    OCT. 31: Waste Management's board meets. ChemLawn is discussed only briefly, and is ruled out as a takeover target by Mr. Buntrock. Officials at the company say ChemLawn didn't belong on the agenda under &quot;pending acquisitions&quot; in the first place.    (Mr. Huizenga prepared the agenda and says it was his idea to add ChemLawn. He says Mr. Buntrock asked him before the meeting why ChemLawn was listed under &quot;pending acquisitions.&quot; Mr. Huizenga replied that the company's efforts to get into residential services could lead it toward lawn care. &quot;While clearly not endorsing the idea, Mr. Buntrock did not tell Mr. Huizenga to delete ChemLawn from the agenda,&quot; according to the committee's report. Mr. Buntrock recalls he &quot;was upset with Mr. Huizenga for adding ChemLawn to the agenda&quot; because it might confuse discussion of another company Waste Management wanted to buy. Minutes from the Oct. 31 board meeting weren't prepared until late December.)    NOV. 14: Mr. Buntrock buys 2,000 ChemLawn shares, his last purchase, bringing his family's stake to 35,000.    NOV. 17: Waste Management's outside law firm sends recent ChemLawn financial disclosure filings to Mr. Seegers, president of the Waste Management Partners Inc. He says he asked for these documents &quot;looking ahead, hoping to anticipate a request from Mr. Buntrock to get information on ChemLawn and then being able to 'impress the boss' by having 'a leg up.'&quot;    DECEMBER: Sometime before Christmas, Mr. Lewis, the Morgan Lewis investment banker, talks with Mr. Buntrock &quot;about making a preliminary approach to ChemLawn.&quot; Mr. Buntrock instructs Mr. Lewis to make &quot;contact on an anonymous basis.&quot; Mr. Buntrock wanted a meeting on a &quot;get-to-know&quot; basis, but didn't want to generate speculation about a takeover, according to the special committee's report. (The report offers no explanation for Mr. Buntrock's abrupt change of attitude toward ChemLawn as a potential acquisition target.)    On Dec. 19, Mr. Huizenga buys 2,000 ChemLawn shares.    In late December, minutes from the Oct. 31 board meeting are prepared by Mr. Huizenga. ChemLawn was &quot;not of interest and was not discussed,&quot; the minutes say.    1987   JANUARY: ChemLawn's investment banker, replying to Mr. Lewis's approach, says ChemLawn isn't &quot;interested in talking to any anonymous parties.&quot; Mr. Buntrock authorizes Mr. Lewis to make another approach, this time identifying Waste Management.    At the Jan. 12 board meeting, ChemLawn isn't mentioned.    JAN. 22: Merrill Lynch investment bankers meet with company officials in New York to pitch a leveraged buyout of ChemLawn.    FEB. 5: Mr. Dempsey buys 2,000 ChemLawn shares.    FEB. 9: Mr. Buntrock is annoyed that Merrill Lynch is pressuring him to make an acquisition. He thinks Merrill Lynch plans to put ChemLawn &quot;into play&quot; regardless of what he does. &quot;Mr. Buntrock left (Waste Management chief financial officer Donald F.) Flynn's office without ever sitting down,&quot; the report says.    FEB. 12: Messrs. Buntrock, Flynn and Rooney meet, and Mr. Flynn now strongly endorses a Waste Management takeover of ChemLawn. Mr. Koenig is ordered to begin preparing data on a ChemLawn acquisition.    FEB. 19: At a meeting with Merrill Lynch and outside lawyers, Waste Management decides to launch a tender offer for ChemLawn.    FEB. 20: Mr. Lewis of Morgan Lewis tells Mr. Buntrock that ChemLawn officials won't meet with Waste Management. &quot;These people will never be friendly,&quot; Mr. Buntrock says, adding he might as well make a hostile offer.    FEB. 25: Waste Management's board authorizes a $27-a-share tender offer for ChemLawn at a special meeting. ChemLawn rejects the bid and ultimately is acquired by EcoLab Inc. of St. Paul, Minn., for $36.50 a share.    MARCH 26 and 27; APRIL 24 andamp; 27: Mr. and Mrs. Buntrock, the Buntrock family trusts, Peter Huizenga and Mr. Dempsey sell their ChemLawn stock at $36.25-to-$36.50 a share, realizing a combined profit of about $1 million. </TEXT></DOC>
