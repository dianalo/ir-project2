The chilling slide was concentrated in the last hour of tradingFriday, shortly after United Airlines parent UAL Corp. announcedthe unraveling of an employee-led $6.75 billion buyout bid thatdepended heavily on borrowed cash.   Nearly $200 billion in paper wealth vanished as investors dumpedstocks and computerized trading programs went into anacross-the-board ``sell'' mode.   ``It's total emotional and psychological chaos,'' said EugenePeroni, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady sought to reassureAmericans that the outlook for economic growth remains sound.   ``It's important to recognize that today's stock market declinedoesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of theeconomy,'' Brady said, noting that the decline followed a 591-pointrise in the Dow industrials since the start of the year.   President Bush, new Securities and Exchange Commission ChairmanRichard C. Breeden and the Federal Reserve all declined comment.   Nevertheless, some observers saw uncanny parallels with a108-point Dow drop on a Friday exactly two years ago, whichpresaged the record 508-point plunge on Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987.   ``Nobody believes in witchcraft,'' Washington economist MichaelEvans said. But he added, ``We're seeing the same type ofphenomenon that propelled the market down two years ago.''   At day's end, the widely watched Dow Jones average of 30industrial stocks had plunged 190.58 points to 2,569.26, thebiggest point drop since Black Monday.   On a percentage basis, Friday's loss was only the 12th worstever _ 6.91 percent _ ranking far behind the record 22.6 percentdrop on Black Monday and the 12.8 percent decline on Oct. 28, 1929,which heralded the start of the Great Depression.   Other stock indices fell sharply as investors sought refuge inthe relatively safe credit markets. Big investor appetite for bondspushed interest rates down to their lowest levels since April 1987.   Unlike two years ago, when weeks of increasingly volatiletrading preceded the crash, Friday's decline came with littlewarning. The Dow already had posted five record highs this month,and the average was down only about 23 points two hours before theclose of trading.   At the height of the selloff, the average plummeted a littlemore than 100 points in an hour.   But there were some similarities.   Two years ago, worries that Congress would restrict in leveragedbuyouts contributed to the market crash. Today, questions over theability to finance takeovers has the market spooked.   Computerized ``program trading'' was blamed in part for theearlier crash, and analysts said it contributed to the latest dive,though safeguards installed since October 1987 were said to havelessened the effect.   Adding to the feeling of deja vu, the administration andCongress were wrestling once again with the budget deficit, and asurge in wholesale prices reported Friday renewed fear thatinflation may worsen.   Some analysts played down the similarities.   ``I think it's a one-day panic,'' said economist David Wyss ofDRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. ``I thinkit's fairly clear the drop was caused by the (United Airlines)deal.''   News that financing for the UAL deal had broken down heightenedconcerns that the takeover fever supporting stock prices may beover, brokers said. The buyout of the nation's second-largestairline would have relied largely on the sale of high-risk,high-yielding ``junk bonds,'' commonly used to finance leveragedbuyouts.   ``Leveraged buyouts have been the principal drive to stockprices this year ... and if that prop gets removed, stocks wouldhave to go down,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president atFirst Albany Corp.   The market for junk bonds was shaken last month when Canadianretailing giant Campeau Corp. announced it was unable to makepayments on bonds it issued in buyouts of Allied Stores Corp. andFederated Department Stores Inc.   Following the 1987 crash, regulators imposed what they called``circuit breakers'' that automatically limited trading if the Dowindustrials rose or fell 50 points. This restriction was laterexpanded to 250 points.   In Chicago, similar circuit breakers went into effect for thefirst time. The Mercantile Exchange said trading of futures on theStandard andamp; Poor's 500 index was halted twice.   New York Stock Exchange President Richard A. Grasso said thesafeguard, intended to blunt the effect of computerized programtrading, worked ``exceptionally well'' Friday.   Nevertheless, Janney Montgomery's Peroni said the severe dropraised worries over what will happen Monday: ``It's bad because itmeans that there's going to be two days for fear to fester.''</TEXT></DOC>
