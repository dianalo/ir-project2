A veteran of CIA operations in Central America andSoutheast Asia, Felix Rodriguez had access to Mr. Bushthrough his close friendship with the vice president'snational security adviser, Donald Gregg. With White Housesupport, Mr. Rodriguez won a post in early 1985 at theIlopango air base in El Salvador, where he cultivatedpersonal relations with the Salvadoran air force command thatwould prove valuable to the secret airlift operation insideNicaragua.</LP><TEXT>   Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gregg, now U.S. ambassador to SouthKorea, have denied repeatedly they knew of Mr. Rodriguez'swork in facilitating the Contra supply flights. Butinterviews and documents show the CIA, which was barred fromproviding arms to the insurgents, understood his dual role byearly 1986.   Later that year, in a taped telephone conversation Aug. 6,CIA officers indicate they went so far as to check with theWhite House regarding Mr. Rodriguez's authority and proposedasking that the vice president's office intercede to curb hisactivities in Central America.   &quot;We have checked with everybody in Washington, includingthe vice president's office, and there is no writ anywherefor Felix Rodriguez in any way to be involved with anythingto do with Nicaragua, the Nicaraguan resistance, or C-123'sor C-7's or anything else operating out of Ilopango . . . ,&quot;said the chief of the CIA's Central American task force, AlanFiers, in a call to a colleague in Central America. &quot;When itcomes to issues to deal with El Salvador and air force andair power, he does have a certain writ out of the VicePresident's office, and that is part of the problem. We needto try to do away with that writ, and in the days ahead I amgoing to see if I can't get some people to do that.&quot;   &quot;We have got to try to get him out of the Nicaraguan potbecause he is really muddying the waters, and it's going tocause us big problems just at a time when we don't need it,&quot;said Mr. Fiers in reference to legislation then to end acongressional ban on military aid to the Contras. &quot;We arecoming back in the game, and it is only a matter of weeksaway until we do that, and Felix Rodriguez could derail thewhole thing through his ad libbing.&quot;   Nothing in the transcript contradicts statements made byMr. Bush's office on the issue, but the evident CIA concernand knowledge of Mr. Rodriguez's dual role goes to thequestion of why Mr. Bush's aides weren't more aware of whatthe operative was doing.   Mr. Fiers's contacts with Mr. Bush's office appear to havebeen largely through the National Security Council staff atthe White House, which oversaw the covert airlift. Onequestion raised by the tape is whether the CIA was misleditself by NSC aide Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, who soughtMr. Rodriguez's assistance in 1985 but was at odds later withthe independent-minded operative.   Through his attorney Stanley Arkin, Mr. Fiers emphasizedFriday that he had no knowledge that Mr. Bush &quot;was privy toor knowledgeable of&quot; Mr. Rodriguez's activities related toIran-Contra. Regarding Mr. Gregg's role, the former CIAofficer, who is cooperating with a criminal inquiry byIran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, was less specific.&quot;Alan cannot speculate on the state of his {Mr. Gregg's}knowledge,&quot; Mr. Arkin said Friday.   A declassified transcript of the Aug. 6 call was providedto The Wall Street Journal by the Senate IntelligenceCommittee after Chairman David Boren cited the tape inquestioning a CIA officer in relation to Robert Gates'scandidacy to head the agency. Separately, the panel voted11-4 Friday to report Mr. Gates' nomination to the fullSenate favorably, despite continued reservations by seniorDemocrats, including Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, about hisrecord as a top manager in the CIA.   The transcript, labeled &quot;top secret codeword,&quot; doesn'tidentify the second officer speaking with Mr. Fiers, but heappears to have been stationed in El Salvador. &quot;Until thecompany gets Felix out {deleted}, I don't think that thegeneral by himself will be able to turn him off,&quot; says thesecond CIA officer in apparent references to Mr. Rodriguez'sties to the Contra &quot;enterprise&quot; and Salvadoran command.   In a later exchange, the officer says of Mr. Rodriguez:&quot;Over the longer run, somebody like in Washington, if he hasreally got some connection in some aspects of this with theVP's office, then I think somebody has got to get him backthere and sit him down and just tell him what the party lineis going to be in the future.&quot;   The tape recording, made at CIA headquarters, is similarto those reviewed by Mr. Walsh, whose inquiry has shown apersistent interest in Mr. Rodriguez. Never a large player inthe Iran-Contra affair, Mr. Rodriguez is nonethelessimportant not only because of his ties to Mr. Gregg but alsohis use of State Department equipment in El Salvador andrelations to the U.S. Ambassador Edwin Corr.   The retired chief of the Salvadoran air force and aRodriguez ally, Gen. Juan Rafael Bustillo, was questioned byMr. Walsh's office last spring. And this portion of theinquiry could receive new attention following a plea bargainagreement this month with former Assistant Secretary of StateElliott Abrams, who pledged to assist Mr. Walsh.</TEXT></DOC>
