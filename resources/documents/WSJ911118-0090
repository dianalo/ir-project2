In Cincinnati, the president ofFederated Department Stores warns of a new round of retailerbankruptcies. And Boston University student Glenn Zimmermanworries that he could have to cut back his Christmas shoppingthis year for lack of credit.   This wasn't exactly what President Bush had in mind lastWednesday when, during a political speech in New York, heurged banks to cut their credit-card interest rates. The linewas inserted by the president at the last minute, accordingto White House spokesman Gary Foster. It wasn't included in adraft of the speech that circulated through the White House,and it hadn't been cleared by Mr. Bush's top economicadvisers.</LP><TEXT>   But the call for lower credit-card rates has detonated anationwide explosion, spreading panic among bankers andretailers and even, according to some market analysts,triggering Friday's steep stock-market slide. Suddenly, thecredit-card furor has emerged as a vivid illustration of boththe paralysis of Washington's economic policy-making and thefragility of the U.S. economy.   While Mr. Bush lit the match, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato pouredon the gasoline. The New York Republican was at the Wednesdayspeech and basked in the president's praise. &quot;Thank God wehave people like Al fighting for our values every day&quot; inCongress, Mr. Bush said.   The next day, Sen. D'Amato went to the Senate floor andpushed a measure that would force credit-card interest ratesdown to 14% from their current average of 18.9%. Hissurprised fellow senators, quickly recognizing the politicalappeal of the move, voted 74-19 to support him. Not to beoutdone, a House subcommittee is scheduled to consider aninterest rate cap today with the possibility of passingsomething this week.   Overwhelmed by complaints from banks, retailers,regulators and its own economic advisers, the White House nowis reining in the stampede it started. But it won't be easy.&quot;I think the bull is out of the chute,&quot; says Stephen Bell, aWashington lobbyist for Salomon Brothers. &quot;It will be verydifficult to kill this outright.&quot;   Even if the cap effort fails, the political and economicimpact of the proposal will linger. It's likely to remain ametaphor for Washington's failure to address a limpingeconomy. The huge market in credit-card-backed securities hasbeen shaken. And the proposal will almost certainly promptfurther efforts by consumers as well as legislators to bringdown credit-card rates. &quot;It's made the consumer more aware&quot;of high rates, says John McCoy, the chairman of Banc OneCorp., a major issuer. &quot;He'll be out looking for lower rates.I think it will cause a decline.&quot;   Clearly Mr. Bush and Sen. D'Amato hit a nerve. Credit-cardrates are stubbornly high. Average credit-card interest rateshave stuck near 19% in recent years, providing sizableprofits to credit-card issuers, while almost all otherinterest rates have plummeted to their lowest levels in morethan a decade. &quot;The bank card industry has brought this onitself,&quot; says Elgie Holstein, executive director of BankcardHolders of America in Herndon, Va. Says Sen. D'Amato: &quot;Whatwe're talking about is working, middle-class taxpayers whoare being called upon to bail out the banks for the bad loansthey've made.&quot;   But the flip side of the argument, made forcefully byTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady during an appearance on&quot;Meet the Press&quot; yesterday, is that the D'Amato cap couldlead many banks to withdraw credit cards from high-riskcustomers, crimping consumer spending at precisely the wrongtime for a stagnant economy. &quot;If this legislation wentthrough, the only people who would have credit cards are therich people in this country,&quot; Mr. Brady said. White Houseeconomic adviser Michael Boskin called the measure&quot;economically dangerous,&quot; and Federal Reserve Board ChairmanAlan Greenspan said the cap would aggravate the currentcredit crunch.   Mr. Brady predicts confidently that the measure is &quot;nevergoing to see the light of day.&quot; But the bizarre battle hasclearly put the administration in a political bind. Althoughit opposes rate caps as a form of credit allocation, ithasn't yet vowed to veto the bill. Mr. Brady suggests a vetothreat might give &quot;an inducement to Congress to irresponsiblyput this on the president's desk,&quot; forcing the president toeither sign it or veto a politically popular measure.   To be sure, the measure has strong popular appeal. &quot;Ithink the law is an excellent idea,&quot; said Jane Burke, whileshopping at Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. in Washington Friday. &quot;Itmight get people buying again, not to have that little extrainterest.&quot; Moreover, the proposal comes at a time when allother efforts to help the economy appear to have fizzled.Huge budget deficits have prevented Congress from enactingnew tax cuts or spending programs, at least for this year.And efforts by the Federal Reserve to cut other interestrates don't seem to be having much effect.   The problem, however, is that Sen. D'Amato's cure may beworse than the disease. Even allowing for hyperbole, cardissuers -- from Citicorp to Marting's Department Store inPortsmouth, Ohio -- probably would curtail credit to theirriskiest customers. &quot;There is a large percentage of thepopulation that you couldn't service at a 14%,&quot; says DavidHunt, who runs the credit-card operation at Signet BankingCorp. &quot;Probably you'd be cutting out 50% to 60% of yourcustomers.&quot;   In the long run, cutting off credit to high-risk customersmight be a wise move. Credit cards were issuedindiscriminately during the 1980s, American householdssaddled themselves with a huge debt burden, and default ratesare rising sharply.   In the short run, however, a cut in consumer credit wouldsurely restrain an economic recovery that seemed enervatedfrom the start. Moreover, the move would take away one of thefew areas of profits for the nation's battered bankingsystem, perhaps forcing more of them into governmentbailouts. For Citicorp, the nation's largest bank and largestholder of credit-card debt, the cap would turn estimated 1992earnings of $1.50 per-share into a loss of 58 cents a share,Keefe Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc. predicts.   Many retailers, hard hit as well by the economic problemsof recent years, say they would also be losing one of theirfew sources of profits. David Horr, chairman of Marting'sDepartment Store in Portsmouth, says the rate reduction would&quot;reduce our bottom line by about $60,000. That will make adifference between a modest profit for this company and aloss.&quot;   Mr. Horr says the rate ruckus is just another sign ofWashington's inability to set economic policy intelligently.&quot;This just underscores one of the real problems that Americanbusinesses have with our government: We can't count on them,&quot;he says. &quot;You can't plan for the future.&quot;   After Friday's market plunge, some senators who voted forthe cap are having second thoughts. Sen. Christopher Dodd, aConnecticut Democrat who supported the D'Amato amendmentWednesday, told the Senate Friday that he now wants to modifyit. &quot;Certainly lowering interest rates for consumers has anappealing ring to it,&quot; he said. But the bill needs to bechanged &quot;to reflect some very legitimate concerns that havebeen raised.&quot;   Already, the effort to cut rates is having some effect.American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which is aggressivelymarketing its new Universal Card in competition with banks,capitalized on the furor by announcing a rate reductioneffective today. Unlike most bank cards, ATandamp;T's card chargesa rate that varies with the prime rate -- the banks' basiclending rate. The company said it was accelerating anexpected rate decline by 90 days in answer to &quot;PresidentBush's call to do even more for the American public.&quot; ATandamp;T'srate will fall to 16.4% from 17.4% for the 8.5 million&quot;charter&quot; card holders and to 17.4% from 18.4% for nearlythree million noncharter card holders.   Although Sen. D'Amato complains it &quot;is not a free market,&quot;the credit-card business is in fact enormously competitive.But issuers compete by bringing in new borrowers rather thanbringing down rates. As a result, the last decade has seen atremendous democratization of credit, with steadily growingpercentages of poor and lower-middle-class families joiningthe ranks of credit-card holders.   &quot;During the '80s, credit cards were extended to youngpeople {and} low-income people who never would have gotcredit before, and those people are in trouble now,&quot; saysSandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, aWashington, D.C., consulting firm.   The results of making credit cards more widely availableare striking. J.C. Penney Co., the giant Dallas-basedretailer, says 63% of all its sales were on credit cards in1990, up from 42.5% in 1980. Penney targets middle America:families with incomes between $35,000 and $70,000. Accordingto a Federal Reserve survey, in 1986, 61% of nonwhite orHispanic families had a credit card, up from 35% in 1977.   The expansion of credit cards, however, has led to lowerprofits, for a number of reasons, including an alarmingincrease in personal bankruptcies, higher operating costs anda rising number of card holders who are paying off theircredit-card balances in full or are trying to pay down theirdebt as a consequence of the slow economy. As a result, banksare earning less from finance charges.   Meanwhile, expenses are rising as more consumers becomedelinquent or don't pay at all. Banks have chargedoff-written off their balance sheet as uncollectable -- 42%more than last year, and are spending more on collectionefforts, according to the Nilson report, which monitors thecard industry.   Many banks now say they would be unable to earn a profitat a 14% rate. Already, banks' earnings per card had fallento $18.46 in 1990 from $20.51 in 1989, when the industryenjoyed its greatest returns, according to the Nilson Report.For 1991, profits are expected to go down to $15.32 per card.With a 14% cap on interest rates, banks would lose $9.73 oneach card if they kept all their current customers, theNilson report says.   In order to avoid such losses, banks would probably make anumber of moves to shore up their credit-card operations,including raising annual fees and eliminating the graceperiod between when the charges are billed to the customerand when interest is incurred. Rich Greenawalt, president ofAdvanta Corp. in Horsham, Pa., said on Friday that hiscompany could reduce the annual interest rate on its 1.8million credit cards to 13.95% from 17.95% by imposing anannual fee of $48. Most of its credit cards don't currentlycarry any fee.   More importantly, banks would also tighten creditrequirements, perhaps dramatically. &quot;You would have to beultrasensitive,&quot; says Scott P. Marks, head of First ChicagoCorp.'s credit-card business. &quot;That would leave out a largesegment of consumers.&quot; The cap would force banks and others&quot;to be more careful about the issuance of credit cards tofirst-time people,&quot; Mr. Holstein of Bankcard Holders says.   Banks would also likely increase the fees they chargeretailers and other merchants that accept credit cards. Theretailers would attempt to pass those on to consumer in theform of higher prices.   Some economists fear that the mere threat of reducedaccess to credit could quickly discourage buying, as did theillfated credit controls President Carter and the FederalReserve imposed in 1980 -- which prompted a recession. &quot;Asthe 1980 credit controls and the 1990 credit crunch vividlydemonstrate, restraints on credit quickly translate intorestraints on growth,&quot; says Susan Hering, an economist atSalomon Brothers.   The presidents of Banc One's 75 banks in seven statesstarted contacting members of Congress over the weekend tohead off the D'Amato cap. So far, the debate has &quot;been moreemotional than knowledgeable,&quot; Mr. McCoy says. &quot;Politically,they've got to find a way to get themselves out of thisthing. I don't think they have any expectation of whatthey're going to do to the marginal bankers.&quot;   ---   Staff reporters Peter Pae and Steven Lipin contributed tothis article.</TEXT></DOC>
