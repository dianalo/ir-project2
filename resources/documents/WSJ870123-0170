Unfortunately, their exercise serves more to demonstrate the difficulty of doing so than it does in solving the problem.    They write off as &quot;utterly irrelevant to political realities&quot; the libertarian, rights-oriented case for laissez faire (while conceding that it is &quot;true&quot;). In doing so, they undermine the very moral base from which they seek to establish their laudable defense of free enterprise and limited government. Their concern over &quot;political realities&quot; is precisely what has undermined the Reagan administration's original agenda of reducing the burden of government. Political reality is not reality in the sense of a law of physics. It can be changed. Indeed, is that not the purpose of intellectual/philosophical movements?    By embracing a pragmatic, statistical strategy they are vulnerable to statistical counterattacks from the left. Most of the media will believe the liberals, and most of the public remains confused. One must use what economic data one can, of course. But in the long run the case for the free market hinges on our ability to convince Americans (as they were once convinced by Jefferson, Paine, Mason, et al.) that there are certain principles that are required to sustain a free society, that government's role must be strictly limited, and that economic freedom is important regardless of its byproduct-prosperity.    Otherwise we are left in a position of lamely pointing to studies, as Mr. Rahn and Ms. Noonan do, which purport to prove that &quot;maximum rates of economic growth occur when government spending is about 15% to 25% of GNP.&quot; Oh? What on earth could government do with 25% of GNP that would foster economic growth? Does this mean an economy in which government took, say, 10% of GNP would be less prosperous? I doubt it, and I suspect Mr. Rahn and Ms. Noonan doubt it, too.    Finally, why must intelligent conservatives persist in being apologists for the Pentagon? &quot;By providing a defense umbrella for its allies,&quot; they write, &quot;the U.S. also benefits from an increase in worldwide prosperity and security.&quot; Our alliance system is in reality a giant welfare program in which U.S. taxpayers subsidize the defense of nations like West Germany, Korea and Japan that are perfectly capable of defending themselves.
