Five opposition parties, from communists to conservatives,united to kill the plan calling for a two-year freeze on wages andprices and restrictions on strikes. The government proposed thebill to quell escalating wage demands and labor strife.   The vote was 190-153 endorsing a committee resolution to rejectthe government's plan. Six members were absent.   Immediately following the vote Carlsson went to the chamber ofSpeaker Thage G. Peterson to hand in his resignation, Swedish Radioand the national news agency TT reported.   The resignation set off what could be an extended period ofhaggling to create a new government. If unsuccessful, an earlyelection will be required.   Commentators said Carlsson was the only politician capable offorming a new government, since his Social Democrats and Communiststogether could block any non-socialist coalition.   In an earlier speech, Carlsson said his plan was intended toguarantee continued full employment, ``the basis of a fairsociety.''   ``If the five opposition parties together reject the SocialDemocratic proposals, then Mr. Speaker, the government willresign,'' Carlsson had said, winning applause from the packedchamber and the spectators' gallery.   The vote came after several hours of debate.   All opposition parties said they objected to the measures. ``Wehappily reject these proposals, which no one believes in,'' saidCarl Bildt, leader of the center-right Moderate party, daringCarlsson to call an immediate election.   Carlsson would remain head of a caretaker government whilePeterson consulted on the formation of another government.   The assignment could be given to a coalition of center-rightopposition parties or Carlsson, himself, could be asked to tryagain.   If no one succeeded, an election would be called 35 to 90 daysafter efforts broke down. The next scheduled election is inSeptember 1991.   The Social Democrats, who have governed Sweden for 51 of thelast 58 years, unveiled the wage-price freeze last week to suppressa convulsion of strikes.   All Sweden's banks have been closed for nearly three weeks,drying up retail business and threatening major industries withliquidity and supply problems.   A potentially crippling strike of pre-school teachers, nursesand other municipal employees was suspended until next week.   Carlsson said the labor chaos was throwing the economy offbalance, adding that Sweden cannot afford to meet the wage demands.Salaries rose 28 percent over the last three years, whileproduction grew an average 2 percent, he said.   The measures were designed to curb an inflation rate headingtoward 9 percent, about double the European average. Economistshave blamed the low unemployment of just over 1 percent for addinginflationary pressures.   Carlsson said the opposition is so splintered that Sweden'seconomic crisis would be compounded by a political crisis if theSocial Democrats were forced out of office.   ``A political crisis might be created that leads to paralysis,uncertainty and insecurity, and that is the last thing Sweden needstoday,'' he said.   The Social Democrats control 156 seats in the 349-memberRiksdag, usually working in cooperation with the 20-seat CommunistParty.   The three center-right parties have a total of 152 seats, andthe balance is held by the Environment Party.</TEXT></DOC>
