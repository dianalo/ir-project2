Also Sunday, a rebel leader claimed opponents of American basesin the Philippines are targets of an assassination plot hatched bysupporters of President Corazon Aquino and the U.S. government.   Army headquarters in Manila said soldiers and civilian militiamenwere on patrol when they encountered more than 100 New People's Armyrebels in Tulunan town in North Cotabato, 600 miles southeast of thecapital.   The soldiers, backed by artillery fire and air strikes, battledthe rebels for three hours, the report said. A soldier and at least20 rebels were killed in the firefight, it said. It did not say whenthe battle was fought.   Rebels have been fighting for 20 years to install a Marxistgovernment.   Rebel leader Antonio Zumel, spokesman of the communist NationalDemocratic Front, claimed an alleged assassination plot would be putinto action before the start of official talks between thePhilippine and U.S. governments on the future of American militaryfacilities in the Philippines.   ``The plot involves the neutralization and, even worse, theassassination of leading personalities from the NDF and the legalmovement who are opposed to the U.S. bases,'' Zumel said in astatement.   ``The elimination of certain key cadres of the CPP's (CommunistParty of the Philippines) National Urban Commission and United FrontCommission will then be blamed on the so-called warring factionswithin the CPP and NDF,'' he added.   No comment was available from the presidential office and U.S.Embassy, which are closed on Sundays.   Several groups, including the communist underground, have pressedfor the dismantling of six U.S. facilities, which they view as aninfringement on Philippine sovereignty.   The future of the bases is to be a major topic during Mrs.Aquino's visit to the United States in November. The bases' leaseexpires in 1991, and any extension must be approved by two-thirds ofthe 23-member Senate, where opposition to the facilities is strong.</TEXT></DOC>
