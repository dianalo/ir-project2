The study cited a number of reasons for the Pentagon's weaponsproblems, including overreliance on new technologies, insufficienttesting of new weapons, inadequate competition among contractbidders and a ``revolving door'' between the Pentagon procurementsystem and private defense contractors.   It also blamed members of Congress for judging new weaponsprojects on the potential economic payoff for their own state ordistrict rather than the actual need for the weapons.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney recently forwarded to PresidentBush a package of recommendations for improving management of thePentagon, including changes in the procurement process. Details ofCheney's recommendations have not been made public.   The Nader group's study cited numerous weapons systems that havebeen plagued by previously reported problems, including theMidgetman and MX Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles,the M-1 Abrams tank, the F-14 Tomcat fighter jet and the BradleyFighting Vehicle. It said this formed a pattern of ineffectivePentagon control of procurement that undermines U.S. security.   Among the study's recommended reforms:   _Establish a ``procurement'' corps of weapons experts independentof the Defense Department and the military services, to manage allphases of weapons system acquisition. It would analyze the services'weapons requests, determine when development of new systems wasneeded, award production contracts and oversee testing.   _Increase competitive bidding, in part by inviting foreignmilitary contractors to participate in design competitions.   _End the practice of beginning production of a new weapon systembefore the development stage has been completed.</TEXT></DOC>
