Both the guerrillas and the army have concentrated most of theirfighters in or around San Salvador and several provincial capitalssince the rebels began their urban offensive Nov. 11.   Areas controlled by the insurgents and government forces havenot changed significantly, but the urban concentration appears tofavor the rebels, whose organizational base always has been theforsaken hamlets and byways of this small Central American nation.   Although fewer guerrillas are operating in the countryside, theyappear to be able to move more openly and with less pressure fromgovernment forces.   In Usulutan Province, in the heavily fought-over eastern thirdof the country, the government forces that were observed generallywere restricted to two paved highways and strategic populationcenters. During one day's travel in one region alone, no governmenttroops were seen at all.   Guerrillas, however, walked openly along trails andoxcart-rutted tracks through fields of corn, sorghum, soybeans andsesame.   In San Francisco Javier, a town of about 5,000 people, residentssaid rebels were coming and going almost daily, buying supplies,talking with townspeople and trying to recruit new fighters.   ``They gather the young guys and ask them to accompany them to ameeting outside town,'' said the owner of a small business. ``Aftera couple hours they come back, except maybe one or two who decideto join.''   He, like others, said the rebels did not point their guns at theprospective recruits or otherwise coerce them. Even so, one of thefew young men around said he hid every time the guerrillas came totown and almost no civilian males between 14 and 25 years oldwalked the streets.   The rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani hasaccused the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front of``kidnapping'' hundreds of young men in recent weeks, allegedly toreplace losses suffered in the offensive.   A five-man rebel squad encountered just south of San Franciscoincluded two boys barely taller than their M-16 assault rifles.One, who appeared to be about 13, flashed a smile and V-for-victorysign. He said he had been a guerrilla for three months.   The army has not completely abandoned the countryside. At theisolated hamlet of El Palmo, north of San Francisco Javier in thewest-central part of the province, a 30-man search-and-destroy unitof an elite infantry battalion engaged and routed a guerrillacontingent.   The soldiers of the Atonal battalion proceeded to burn or throwdown a ravine large quantities of beans, salt, tortillas, freshmeat and clothing left behind by rebels. The guerrilla camp hadalso served as a factory for homemade catapults used as artillery,about a dozen of which were found and destroyed.   In the southeastern part of the province near the Pacific coast,government forces were limited to a contingent of 6th army brigadetroops in Jucuaran and a detachment of Marines on El Espino beach.   Peasant farmers of the region know where the rebels are camped.After an hour of coffee sipping and conversation, a young womanexcused herself and left a tile-roofed adobe house near Jucuaran.She returned a few minutes later to say she would take reporters tothe rebel base several miles away.   ``The offensive is irreversible,'' said ``Carlos,'' thekhaki-clad, AK-47-toting regional commander in an interview beneatha tree beside a cow pasture. ``The war has entered a definitivephase, and nothing except deeper crisis and more instability can beexpected.''   Some of the most destructive fighting of the urban offensive hasbeen in working-class neighborhoods. Carlos acknowledged thattaking the war to the cities may have alienated many of the samepoor people the FMLN claims to champion.   ``People in San Salvador never really felt the war like peoplein the countryside. Their routine of home-to-work-to-home, thedesire for stability came to cloud their vision and limit theirambition to being able to put up a new curtain in the kitchen,'' hesaid.   ``We know war does not bring well-being. It's not that we seewar as the solution in itself. It is a means, and it is the onlyoption they have left us,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
