After rejecting an initial proposal made in February, directors of International Creative's parent company, Josephson International Inc. approved Wednesday a sweetened proposal for a leveraged buyout of Josephson.    Under the proposal, stockholders would receive $14.50 a share for their 2.3 million shares, or $33.4 million. Directors had earlier rejected a proposal that called for holders to receive $11.50 a share and $2 principal amount of 15% subordinated debentures.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Josephson shares closed at $12.875, down 12.5 cents.    Marvin Josephson, chairman and principal stockholder of Josephson, said the company expects to finance the transaction through Chase Manhattan Corp. Mr. Josephson owns 1.5 million of the company's 3.8 million shares outstanding. He also said the company settled shareholder lawsuits connected with the transaction as originally proposed.    Executives of International Creative, including Los Angeles-based Chairman Jeffrey Berg and President James Wiatt, and New York-based Vice Chairman Sam Cohn, will own about 60% of the company after the proposed buy-out.    International Creative is the only publicly held talent agency, and its executives have said the company can't compensate executives and compete as effectively as its closely held rivals such as Creative Artists Agency Inc.    In a leveraged buyout a company is acquired in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
