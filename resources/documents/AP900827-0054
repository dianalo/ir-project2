A third of the teachers who took an alternate route to theclassroom say they'd be willing to work in large inner cities,compared to 12 percent of all current public school teachers and 12percent of new hires from traditional programs, according to thestudy by the National Center for Education Information.   The independent, non-partisan reserach group looked atalternative certification plans in two states as part of a largerteacher study. It found that 43 percent of the non-traditionalteachers in Texas and 20 percent of those in New Jersey wereminorities.   The overall teaching force is becoming older, whiter and morefemale, the study found. The average age of all public schoolteachers is 42 years; of new teachers hired since 1985, the averageage is 35 years. Ninety-two percent of all public school teachersare white and 71 percent are women.   The study of 3,201 elementary and secondary school teacherscurrently on the job also concluded that a predicted teachingshortage probably will not occur because many teachers who leavethe profession tend to return.   Of the teachers in the study, 38 percent have had at least onebreak from teaching; 46 percent of those hired since 1985 have hadone break and 18 percent of these have had two or more breaks.   ``Teaching appears to be a revolving door,'' the study said.   Center director Emily Feistritzer said childbearing was listedmost often as the reason for taking a break from teaching. She saidmore attention should be paid to the ``returning teacherphenomenon.''   ``All this business of teachers being miserable and leaving isnot being borne out in data anywhere,''' she said.   There are 2.3 million public school teachers and another 300,000private school teachers in the United States. Someeducation-related groups are predicting a shortage due to teacherattrition, increasing student enrollments and fewer collegegraduates seeking teaching jobs.   Thanks to Teachers, an organization sponsored by the NationalEducation Association and private business groups, reports thatmany school districts already are reporting shortages. The groupsays far too few college students are enrolled in teacher-trainingprograms to fill the expected 1.3 million teaching job openingsexpected by 1994.   Other studies have estimated that about 200,000 new teacherswould be needed a year.   However, Feistritzer said about 650,000 teachers have been hiredin the last five years, averaging out to 130,000 a year. About71,000 of those hired each year are new teachers.   Three-quarters of the teachers in her study said they expect tobe teaching five years from now. Ten percent predicted they'd be inan education-related occupation, 7 percent plan to switch fieldsand 8 percent expect to retire.   The Feistritzer study is based on the results of a 58-questionsurvey of 2,380 public school teachers, 352 private school teachersand 469 people who had participated in the Texas and New Jerseyalternate-route programs.</TEXT></DOC>
