In a pre-dawn attack Friday, the guerrillas mined Route 69 _ thegovernment's only access road to Svay Chek town _ and seizedpositions east and west of town. Their ultimate objective isSisophon, 13 miles to the south, a government military operationscenter for areas along the Thai border.   Government forces returned the guerrilla fire Saturday, openingup with tanks and heavy guns in blasts that rocked the trenches theguerrillas had dug in the jungles and rice fields. All day, thearea reverberated with the thunder of heavy rounds and automaticweapons fire.   Friday's attack was the third and largest on the town byguerrillas of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, thefront's chief of staff, Gen. Pan Thai, said Saturday. He promisedanother big assault Sunday morning.   ``This is the most important battle so far for the KPNLF,'' hesaid. ``If we do not take Svay Chek tomorrow, we will not withdraw.We will reinforce our positions until we capture Svay Chek.''   The front is the smallest of three guerrilla groups fighting thegovernment that Vietnam installed in Cambodia after a late 1978invasion. Its fighters captured the area north of Svay Chek in lateSeptember, only days after Vietnam made what it claimed was thewithdrawal of its last troops from the country.   The capture of Svay Chek, the capital of the district of thesame name, would be their biggest victory of the war.   But they faced vastly superior government firepower.   ``They have so many mortars and heavy guns we aren't evencounting any more,'' said front-line guerrilla commander Gen. KhunBoeng.   Guerrilla commanders at the scene said the government Thursdayincreased the number of defenders at Svay Chek to 2,000 by truckingin 800 more soldiers just hours before the guerrillas cut off Route69.   While their jungle-shrouded guns pounded the town with mortarsand rockets, hundreds of guerrillas launched infantry attacks onthe defense perimeters at Svay Chek at 4:30 a.m. Friday. The 107mmrockets were captured last month.   ``No problem, no problem! Take cover! Take cover!'' theartillery commander shouted as the Soviet-made T-54 tanks firedback.   Thousands of rounds from rockets, mortars, artillery andautomatic weapons pounded the earth.   Hundreds of soldiers and civilians brought ammunition andsupplies to the front by ox carts, foot and Soviet-made transporttrucks they have captured in the past two weeks.   More than 300 guerrillas arrived early Saturday to join the nextassault, Pan Thai said. Guerrilla commanders from infantry andmortar units met in the jungle command post in Svay Chek districtto plan the attack.   At one guerrilla base, medics were taking off a truck aguerrilla wounded in the shoulder by shrapnel from arocket-propelled grenade. There were no reliable figures oncasualties in the fighting.   Next to their hammocks, the guerrillas dug trenches in thejungles and in the rice fields to prepare for their next advance.</TEXT></DOC>
