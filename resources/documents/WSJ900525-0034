The House on Wednesday approved its version of thelegislation, which would impose the nation's first controlson acid rain, curb cancer-causing emissions from factories,and take a new approach to cleaning up smog in all U.S.cities by 2010. The Senate passed its version last month.</LP><TEXT>   When fully in effect, the legislation is expected toimpose about $21.5 billion in annual costs on industry.&quot;Everybody is going to find out clean air is not free,&quot; saidRep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the House Energy and CommerceCommittee chairman, who predicted that the conference couldbe long and difficult.   Turning up the political heat on the conference, which isexpected to get under way soon after the Memorial Day recess,is the threat of a White House veto if the measure contains aHouse-approved unemployment-assistance package designed tohelp workers who lose their jobs because of the legislation.   The White House contends the five-year, $250 millionmeasure would create &quot;a potentially open-ended liability&quot;because there wouldn't be any way to determine whetherworkers lost their jobs because of the clean-air act oranother reason. Bush administration officials yesterday wereconfident they could kill the provision or dilute it duringconference.   The provision passed the House by a 271-146 margin,however. And in the Senate, a worker-aid package almostprevailed, despite opposition from Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell of Maine. Yesterday, an aide to the senatorsaid he hasn't yet taken a position on the House provision.   Even before the conference, the bills agree on billions ofdollars of controls. Both would force utilities to cutsulfur-dioxide emissions by 10 million tons a year byestablishing an innovative pollution-trading system proposedby President Bush. Under the system, utilities that madeextra-deep cuts would get pollution credits they could sellor swap with other utilities.   The measures would adopt a new system of regulating toxicemissions that would force plants to install the bestavailable technology to reduce cancer risks to nearbyresidents. Each bill would make auto companies clean up autoexhaust and require the oil industry to make cleaner-burninggasoline in an effort to reduce smog. &quot;The differencesbetween the House and Senate bills are not legion,&quot; said Rep.Billy Tauzin (D., La.).   Among key issues to be settled in conference are:   -- Whether to force the auto industry to start making carsthat run on alternatives to gasoline such as methanol andnatural gas. The House bill would launch such a pilot programin California.   -- How to determine whether to impose a second round ofcuts in auto-tailpipe emissions. Under the House bill, thesecuts, which the Environmental Protection Agency estimateswould add $500 to the price of a car, would go into effectonly if an EPA study determined they are needed andcost-effective. The Senate would make the controls dependenton the nation's air quality.   -- How to force factories to reduce the cancer risk tonearby residents after the best available pollutiontechnology has been installed. Industry and environmentalistsgenerally prefer the House approach.   -- How hard to crack down on industrial sources ofsmog-producing chemicals. The House would give a strongerrole to the federal government in forcing states and citiesto clean up smog.   Although they are contained in both bills, thereformulated gasoline provisions will be at issue as well, ifthe oil industry has its way. To the dismay of the industry,the measures spell out a recipe for gasoline to be sold inthe nation's nine smoggiest areas that would require the useof oxygenated additives such as ethanol.   House lawmakers generally contend they are heading intoconference from a strong position. After nine years of beingunable to even bring a clean-air bill to the floor, the Housecompleted voting on its measure in a single day. The speedreflected the effort by Mr. Dingell, a friend to industry,and Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), a strongenvironmentalist, to lock up agreements on almost allcontentious issues before they got to the floor. On severalmajor issues -- including auto-tailpipe emissions andcontrols on industrial smog -- the lawmakers are committed tothe accords through conference.   By contrast, the Senate debate took longer, and leaderswere governed during floor debate by an agreement worked outwith the White House. Mr. Mitchell, who said he would havepreferred stronger provisions on several issues, hasemphasized he is no longer bound by the agreement.   Both industry groups and environmentalists alike expressedoptimism yesterday that the conference committee wouldproduce a better bill than either the House or the Senateversion. William Fay, head of an industrywide lobbying group,said, &quot;I see some real opportunities to make these billsbetter. Mr. Dingell can be fairly formidable in a conferencecommittee.&quot;   Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club said, &quot;Bytaking the best from each, we can have a clean-airmasterpiece.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
