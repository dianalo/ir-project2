'-- REP. PATRICIA SCHROEDER, D-COLO.HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO LET WOMEN FLY COMBATMISSIONS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The panel also completed its deliberations on the $278 billion 1992Pentagon budget, voting to cancel the B-2 Stealth bomber and sharply curtailthe &quot;star wars&quot; anti-missile program.;    Blurred battle lines;  Current lawand regulation prohibit women from holding front-line combat jobs, althoughthe distinction between the front and the rear in battle increasingly hasbecome blurred. For example, three female reservists were among 28 soldierskilled in a Scud missile attack on a barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, duringthe Persian Gulf war.;    In the gulf deployment, 14 women were killed, 21were wounded and two were taken prisoner, according to the Defense Department.But in each case, officials said, the women were in jobs that were technicallyclassified as non-combat.;    About 35,000 of the 541,000 U.S. troops sent tothe Persian Gulf were women, in jobs ranging from physicians to truck driversto transport pilots.;    &quot;The women in Desert Storm did themselves proud,&quot;said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the Armed ServicesCommittee and sponsor of the women-in-combat amendment.;    Resistance frommilitary;  Schroeder and other liberal Democrats have tried for years tobroaden opportunities for women in the military, but they have been resistedby senior military leaders who believe that women should be kept behind thelines.;    Schroeder's amendment -- if approved by Congress and signed intolaw by President Bush -- would allow the Air Force and Navy to permit women tofly combat missions but would not require them to do so. It would be up toeach branch to decide how to implement the law.;    Current law bans anycombat role for women in the Air Force, Navy and Marines. The Army, which isgoverned by no statutory ban, has internal regulations forbidding women fromfilling combat roles.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910509  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  357  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 9, 199100130185,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
