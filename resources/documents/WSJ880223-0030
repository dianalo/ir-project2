President Reagan plans to announce today that he will nominate William Ball, an assistant to the president for legislative affairs, to become the new Navy secretary, administration officials said last night. Mr. Ball, a Navy veteran, served as an aide to Sen. John Tower when the Texas Republican was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He also worked closely with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci when Mr. Carlucci worked in the White House as President Reagan's national security adviser.    The White House considers Mr. Ball an attractive candidate partly because officials believe he would be confirmed by the Senate quickly and without controversy. Mr. Ball has worked closely with senators in his current job as the White House's chief legislative liaison.    Mr. Webb served a troubled 10-month stint as the Navy's leader. He frequently scrapped with the Pentagon leadership -- especially with Mr. Carlucci, who became defense secretary last November. In recent weeks, as sparring over the budget intensified, aides to both men said their relationship was full of animosity.    In a resignation letter delivered to President Reagan, the 42-year-old Navy secretary criticized Mr. Carlucci's handling of the budget crunch. The military squeezed $33 billion from its spending plans for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, and is working toward cutting an additional $174.4 billion for the next four fiscal years.    &quot;Many defense cuts have been made in the wrong areas, and without clear strategic thought,&quot; he said. Noting that Mr. Carlucci repeatedly rejected his advice on the budget, Mr. Webb stated, &quot;I am unable to support him personally, or to defend this amended budget.&quot;    In a brief statement issued after the resignation, Mr. Carlucci expressed regret over Mr. Webb's departure, adding, &quot;I wish him well in his future endeavors.&quot; Privately, aides to Mr. Carlucci complained of Mr. Webb's &quot;bad form&quot; in quitting on short notice without warning the defense secretary in advance.    Beyond the clashes over the Navy budget, Secretary Webb often took an independent course in the Pentagon, to the irritation of senior officials. A former Marine officer much-decorated for his service in Vietnam, he bristled during the long, tedious planning sessions held at the top levels of the Defense Department. Last week, returning from a meeting in Mr. Carlucci's office, he told aides, &quot;I just came back from a totally useless hour at the armed forces policy meeting.&quot;    Last summer, when the Reagan administration was shaping its convoy operations in the Persian Gulf, Secretary Webb rankled the Pentagon brass by voicing reservations. Inside the Pentagon, he repeatedly questioned whether the U.S. had defined its objectives in the region, and if it had a clear plan for meeting its goals and then scaling back its forces.    The budget cuts sparked another wrangle. Initially, Secretary Webb suggested dropping next year's planned construction of a Trident submarine and moving 16 aging frigates into the reserve forces. Instead, Secretary Carlucci restored the submarine and directed the Navy to mothball the frigates. Pentagon officials have said the frigates are costly to maintain and too complicated to be managed by naval reservists.    The upshot, as Mr. Webb and many other Navy officials see it, is that the U.S. may never realize the goal of having a 600-ship Navy -- a goal that President Reagan advanced in his 1980 presidential campaign and that Pentagon leaders have trumpeted throughout his administration. The Pentagon officially stands by the goal, but the demands for further budget savings over the next four years probably will force the Navy to retire other vessels, pushing the goal further into the future.    In a speech made recently at the National Press Club, Mr. Webb raised the ire of many Pentagon officials by a making a pitch for robust Navy funding while other military branches were forced to absorb cuts. In what was perceived as a jab at the Army, he charged that &quot;static defensive positions have drained both our economic and military resources.&quot;    Mr. Webb's departure will allow him to resume his vocation as a novelist and journalist. A year ago, when he was nominated to be Navy secretary, Mr. Webb was set to end a three-year job as the senior Pentagon official in charge of reserve forces. His plans include writing a novel set in the Civil War period and several journalistic projects overseas.    Meanwhile, inside the Pentagon, the Webb resignation marks a milestone in the effort to shrink the military budget. Said one budget planner: &quot;He's a casualty of fiscal reality, as the 600-ship Navy is.&quot;    ---   Gerald F. Seib contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
