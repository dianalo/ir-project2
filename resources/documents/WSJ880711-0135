But as trading moves into September, they add, concerns about the approaching U.S. presidential election could undermine investor confidence and set the market drifting downward.    Analysts foresee a rise in the Financial Times 100-Stock Index of 50 to 100 points, to about the 1950 level, before it falters as participants fret about what the U.S. election holds for British stocks.    In addition, market watchers say trading volumes will dwindle from already low levels over the next three months, as London is beset with its traditional summer doldrums.    As the quarter opens, analysts say they find British stocks range from undervalued to fairly valued against both historic standards and relative to prices in other markets.    The 100-Stock Index closed Thursday, the end of the second quarter, at 1857.6, below the year's best of 1892.2 reached on June 23. The index's 19% advance from its post-crash low is substantial but more cautious than the rally in Tokyo, where stocks last month reached record highs, and New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 21% from its post-crash low.    &quot;We think London equities look cheap on an international basis,&quot; says Tim Watson, a director and U.K. pension fund manager at Foreign andamp; Colonial Management Ltd. in London, a British fund manager that handles more than #2 billion of pension and trust assets.    Analysts say the market appears likely to weather increases in U.K. interest rates, as long as there is evidence that the higher rates are having the desired effect of nipping inflation. The higher rates should also help maintain confidence in the pound.    The latest of five recent half-point increases in the base lending rates came July 4, when the Bank of England signaled an expected rise to 10% by raising its lending rate to discount houses. Analysts say it's just a matter of time before mortgage rates increase, thus damping the inflationary threat posed by the recent surge in consumer credit.    Most analysts agree that base, or prime, rates still need to be pushed further before inflation is checked. A rise to 10% &quot;is only one bus stop on the road to 11% or even higher,&quot; one equity analyst says.    Stocks &quot;can absorb&quot; interest-rate rises as long as they aren't viewed as a panic step, says Charles Larkum, an analyst at James Capel andamp; Co. But the impact of rates on the stock market &quot;will progressively become more serious as we move higher.&quot;    Possibly the greatest problem facing the pound is the growing U.K. trade deficit. The U.K. current account deficit reached a record #1.205 billion for May and led Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson to concede that his forecast of a #4 billion deficit for the year is too low.    The disappointing May trade figure was in large part responsible for the decision of U.K. brokerage Capel to scale back its forecast for the 100-Share Index in the next quarter, to a high of about 1950 from its previous prediction of 2000.    The U.K. balance of payments &quot;is a well-known problem that isn't going away,&quot; says Glenn Davies, an equity strategist at CL-Alexanders Laing Cruickshank Ltd. &quot;The pound is bound to fall in the medium term as foreign investors react to signs that the U.K. economy is faltering.&quot;    In the end, however, &quot;the largest uncertainty&quot; in the U.K. market for the quarter &quot;could be the U.S. election in November,&quot; Mr. Davies says.    Michael Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential candidate, &quot;is an unknown quantity to European investors and any evidence that he is pulling ahead will be rather disturbing to them,&quot; says Jeffrey Thompson, an equity strategist with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Holdings Ltd. in London. But even if Republican candidate George Bush were to regain the lead in the U.S. polls, the markets wouldn't necessarily prosper, analysts say.    Analysts say dollar-sensitive international issues will be favored over the course of the next quarter, as many think the dollar has hit bottom. Dollar earners like Hanson Trust, Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), Reuters Holdings, Rolls-Royce, British Aerospace, Jaguar and Glaxo Holdings were among the shares mentioned as solid &quot;buy&quot; recommendations by analysts and fund managers in London.    Conversely, stocks in the retail and stores sector would likely be knocked by higher costs of credit and interest rates, analysts say. What's more, properties and building sector shares are forecast to fall back in the wake of higher mortgage costs, they say.    Some market watchers say bid speculation, which played a pivotal role during the second quarter in energizing an otherwise dull market, will continue to be present over the next quarter, albeit in a less substantial way. They also contend that bid speculation will likely continue as a prominent feature in the U.K. market as 1992 approaches, the year a single, barrier-free European market is planned.    In contrast, another analyst says recurrent bid speculation may have seen its heyday, as the market will begin to discount bids that fail to materialize and players take profits in disappointment. &quot;It's a tactic and a fad that can come around every so often to ramp (raise) a stock,&quot; he says. But its usefulness lasts only a short while, he adds.    ---   World Market Activity   London share prices rose strongly Friday, led by engineering issues, following news of a major arms-sale agreement between Britain and Saudi Arabia. Last week's North Sea oil rig explosion, which helped depress shares Thursday, didn't have any market impact Friday, dealers said.    The Financial Times 100-Share Index rose 21.7 points to 1877.2. The narrower 30share index rose 22.6 to 1506.8. Volume of 602 million shares was stronger than in recent sessions and particularly high for a Friday.    British Aerospace, which makes the Tornado fighter bomber that reportedly is at the center of the Saudi deal, leaped to a new 1988 high of 447 pence ($7.66) from 405 pence. Rolls Royce, the jet engine maker, also advanced. Drinks were another strong sector led by Guinness, after news that it is acquiring a stake in French luxury goods group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.    Share prices in Tokyo rose Friday but the market continued to lack a clear focus and trading fell back to a moderate level.    The Nikkei index gained 188.95 points to close at 27917.08 after losing 38.47 points Thursday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange first section index, which gained 4.31 points Thursday, rose 17.05 points to close at 2197.91. Turnover was 1.4 billion shares, sharply down from 2.0 billion shares Thursday.    In early trading in Tokyo Monday, share prices were higher. The Nikkei index stood at 27965.88, up 48.80 points.    The Tokyo market was closed Saturday.    Some financial and large-capitalization shares rose, but most buying was scattered through various sectors as the market searched for new direction. The dollar's continued weakness against the yen helped relieve concern that Japanese interest rates might rise and spur inflation, and thereby gave a boost to the stock market. But the yen's strength also helped trigger selling of export-oriented electrical and precision instrument issues.    In Frankfurt, prices bounced back Friday from the day-earlier bout of profit-taking, closing broadly higher in moderate trading. Shares were pushed higher by the stronger dollar and widespread relief that the day-earlier correction was short-lived and mild, brokers said. Thursday's decline on Wall Street and the rise in West German bond yields to their highest level this year did little to damp the bullish mood, they said. Automobile shares paced the market.    Elsewhere in Europe, prices rose in Zurich, ended mixed in Stockholm, Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris, and fell in Milan. In Pacific markets, prices closed higher in Sydney, Seoul and Wellington, were mixed in Hong Kong and lower in Manila and Taipei.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
