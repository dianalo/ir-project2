As a result, their main task when they officially opentheir session today is expected to be determining the size ofsuch cuts and how they'll be shared among the 13 members ofthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</LP><TEXT>   Technically, the emergency meeting called by SadekBoussena, Algeria's oil minister and acting OPEC president,is only of the organization's policy-setting monitoringcommittee. But Mr. Boussena invited all ministers to attend,and as they arrived yesterday, most quickly began informalconsultations. Many also met with Mr. Boussena last night.   The ministers were summoned on only about 10 days' noticeto figure out ways to halt a steep petroleum price slide. Themeeting was seen as so urgent that it was called even thougha regular session had already been scheduled for May 25. Mr.Boussena pushed that back to June 25.   World oil prices have skidded as much as $6 a barrel thisyear, mostly because OPEC's output has been running as muchas two million barrels a day ahead of its official first-halfproduction ceiling. Only in recent days have prices come offtheir lows to stabilize, in part because of OPEC's plannedmeeting and signs that its production is already easing some.Yesterday, oil prices rose as traders tried to avoid beingcaught short by today's meeting.   As they arrived, several ministers made clear that theyare disturbed by current oil prices.   &quot;We want them higher,&quot; said Hisham Nazer, oil minister ofSaudi Arabia. The kingdom, Kuwait and the United ArabEmirates generally are cited as major contributors to the oilglut because they have been producing beyond their quotas.   Still, most of the oil ministers appeared to be inagreement with Mr. Boussena on the task before them. &quot;Thetarget is clear: {elimination} of the surplus in the market,&quot;Mr. Boussena said.   Mr. Boussena then proposed a solution: OPEC productioncuts of one million to 1.5 million barrels a day. However, hesaid the question of whether all members including those suchas Algeria that already are producing below their quotasshould cut back &quot;is one of the issues we will discuss.&quot;   Other suggestions of possible reductions ranged from500,000 barrels a day to two million. Whatever the figure,the consensus seemed to be that any measures taken hereshould be limited to May and June and that the meeting bekept brief to avoid controversy that might further upset oilmarkets. OPEC's second-half production ceiling andcountry-by-country quotas should be left to the regularsummer conference, several ministers insisted.   &quot;We have to concentrate on what is happening now,&quot; saidDiego Tamariz, Ecuador's oil minister.   Differences have surfaced over how much OPEC is producingat the moment. Some delegates suggested that some ministersare inflating estimates of total production to make any cutslook larger. On the other hand, there have been indicationsrecently that production already is coming down from theeight-year high of 24 million barrels a day reached in March.Buyers have been balking as storage tanks are brimful, andsome exporters have refused to discount prices further tomove more of their oil.   Current output estimates range between 23 million and 24million barrels a day. Most are right about in the middle,though Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister,puts it at the top of the range. &quot;It's quite high,&quot; he toldreporters. &quot;It will have to go down quite a bit.&quot;   OPEC's economists are warning that continued output in thecurrent range would mean an enormous increase in oilinventories. They cautioned that the increases could reach2.2 million to 3.2 million barrels a day and that thisdevelopment could lead to another price fall similar to lastmonth's.   In their latest report, the economists again slightlyrevised upward their projected demand for OPEC oil for 1990to 22.5 million barrels a day. Still, they noted that demandfor OPEC oil, excluding inventory changes, totals only 20.9million barrels a day this quarter. Their estimates for thethird and fourth-quarter demand are 21.4 million and 24.3million, respectively.   Those figures aren't much different from estimates made bysome outside oil economists. Paul Mlotok of Morgan Stanley andamp;Co. forecast demand for OPEC oil at an average of 23 millionbarrels a day for the year, though he said it will run belowthat this quarter. &quot;They really do need to hold it {output}down for May and June,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
