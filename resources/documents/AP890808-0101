Also on Tuesday, more reports of arrests from the spring studentpro-democracy protests trickled into the capital.   A report in the Hebei Daily said seven Beijing student leadersand other alleged counterrevolutionaries were arrested last monthin Hebei. The province surrounds Beijing and many students fledthere after the military crackdown to crush their pro-democracymovement.   The China Daily said colleges have cut by 1,148 the number ofhigh school graduates they will accept from Beijing.   It quoted Li Huangguo, deputy chief of Beijing's HigherEducation Bureau, as saying colleges had adjusted their admissionsto compensate for over-enrollment in some majors.   Students do not select their majors, but are assigned todepartments regardless of personal preference. A more likelyexplanation is that out-of-town colleges fear students from Beijingmay cause political unrest on their campuses.   Many Beijing middle school students joined in the protests ledby college students that were crushed by the army June 3-4.   The government already has said that the college freshman classnationwide will be cut by 30,000 students, to 610,000. Beijingcolleges that led the student movement will have their freshmanclasses cut in half or more in a move that school officials say isa result of the protests.   The China Daily also said admission of new students will takeplace 24 days later than usual, in early October. All studentsexcept freshmen are scheduled to return to most Beijing schools inmid- or late August for several weeks of political education and tofinish classwork from the spring term, which was cut short by theprotests.   The Hebei Daily carried the arrest report July 12, but it onlywas seen in Beijing today.   It identified those arrested as leaders of independent studentunions that organized the protests. Also detained, it said, weretwo leaders of worker and citizen support groups, five peopleaccused of attacking soldiers who put down the protests and anunspecified number of other protesters.   Nearly 2,100 arrests have been reported nationwide, but mostsuch reports stopped in mid-July and thousands more people arebelieved to have been arrested secretly.</TEXT></DOC>
