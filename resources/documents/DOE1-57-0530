Chinese viewpoints were heavilyinfluenced by Western writings on nuclear matters from 1945-1950 andwere characterized by an integrated military, political, and psychologicalrealism. Previous studies, failing to make use of relevant Chinese-languagematerials, have neglected this crucial formative period. Both the Trumanand Eisenhower administrations considered using nuclear weapons in Koreaand China and attempted to shape the political settlement of the warthrough nuclear threats. The Chinese reaction was notable for its effortsto counteract the effects of fear among its population. They acknowledgedthe unprecedented destructiveness, not the military decisiveness, ofthe weapons, but they adamantly denied that nuclear threats would cowthem. Chinese propaganda stressed the Soviet deterrent and skillfullyappealed to worldwide opposition to nuclear weapons, often utilizingWestern spokesmen and playing upon the theme of US misuse of science.The Chinese considered a nuclear attack relatively unlikely but wereprepared to absorb an attack and fight a war of long duration. In Koreaboth the terrain and the extensive tunneling by Chinese troops affordedsignificant protection from nuclear weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
