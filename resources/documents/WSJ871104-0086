Even in today's computerized markets, thousands of hobbyists and professionals still map stock movements with pencils and graph paper. But the market's vexing dives and gains of the past two weeks have threatened to turn their charts into unwieldy origami creations.    Peter Eliades, for instance, has been charting by hand for 18 years. The editor and publisher of Stockmarket Cycles Newsletter in Los Angeles, Mr. Eliades usually can plot the market for six months or a year without adding any graph paper to the top or bottom of a chart. But as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508 points Oct. 19, Mr. Eliades kept reaching for more graph paper and cellophane tape until the chart trailed off his desk to the floor. &quot;I added five pieces -- a yard of paper -- straight down,&quot; he says.    Traditional chartists plot stock market indexes, individual stock prices and other data, looking for signposts that might indicate the future direction of the market. While the hobbyist may simply eyeball the lines and note the direction of the trend, professionals try to divine complex &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;sell&quot; signals.    Computers do most charting these days, but diehards say drawing them by hand gives a better feel for the market. &quot;The computer doesn't worry about aberrations like this,&quot; says Mr. Eliades, who charts electronically as well as manually. &quot;You add on five sheets of paper, you know how the market is doing.&quot;    Forrest R. Biard, a retired physics professor, prefers the low-tech method, too. &quot;I've just never taken to computers,&quot; the amateur chartist says. But how did he accommodate the record drop in the Dow? &quot;I didn't,&quot; he says. &quot;Almost everything went right off my chart.&quot; So, after 30 years of faithfully charting the market, Mr. Biard simply put it aside until prices recover enough to get back on the paper.    Even computerized services say the market turmoil was no picnic. The huge trading volume delayed accurate closing prices, and the wide swings made it hard to translate the data onto paper. &quot;It's just been a nightmare,&quot; says JoAnn Zembryski, director of charting at Mansfield Chart Service Inc., Jersey City, N.J. -- even if customer orders last week did exceed the most optimistic expectations.    Today's tortuous graphs have escalated a long-running, esoteric debate over the best method of constructing scales for stock market charts. Most charts are simply arithmetic, plotting absolute price moves. A 100-point price swing, for instance, is plotted with a line 10 times longer than a 10-point swing. But some graph makers, notably Value Line Inc., have long used logarithmic scales, in which prices of individual issues are plotted according to the percentage by which they change. These charts tend to smooth out roller-coaster swings.    Value Line says the market's recent volatility dramatizes the benefits of logarithmic charts. When there are steep changes in the market, publications using the arithmetic method have &quot;charts that start at the top of the page and go all the way to the bottom,&quot; says Samuel Eisenstadt, director of statistical research, while logarithmic charts take up less depth.    But many traditional chartists criticize the logarithmic approach, saying Value Line's smooth hills and valleys don't present as realistic a picture of today's volatile markets as the zigs and zags of arithmetic charts. &quot;Their charts look terrible,&quot; insists Ms. Zembryski. &quot;Our charts are easier to read and easier to look at,&quot; she says.    But for how long? Already the Commodity Research Bureau, which publishes price charts for stock-index and other futures contracts, has had to reduce its scales to make the arithmetic charts fit. Seymour Gaylinn, bureau production editor, says he hopes he doesn't have to reduce the scales &quot;too much further. We try to make charts as large as possible. That way they're legible and easy to read.&quot; In any case, he says, logarithmic scales would require &quot;a massive educational job&quot; for investors used to studying resistance areas, support levels and other technical barometers in arithmetic charts.    To some investors, however, the real question isn't logarithmic vs. arithmetic, but how helpful charts actually are in predicting market changes. John T. Brown III of Houston, editor of the Prudent Investing newsletter, says, &quot;Charts tell what happened in the past. They don't have much benefit to me.&quot;    Konnie Kuhn, editor of Kon-Lin Letter, Rocky Point, N.Y., however, swears by his charts. &quot;My charts have never failed me, and I don't think they will.&quot; He says in January his newsletter predicted a market tumble in the fourth quarter, based on the charts. He says he's &quot;using rolls and rolls of paper&quot; to keep the charts current these days. &quot;It's a lot of hard, tedious work, but the charts know where the market is. I've been in this business for more than 20 years. The charts don't lie.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
