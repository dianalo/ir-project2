They said three prisoners were missing, possibly killed by afire that swept thorugh a bakery storehouse at the Czarnepenitentiary.   The riots began late Thursday after the Sejm _ lower house ofParliament _ turned down a Senate proposal to extend theSolidarity-led government's amnesty program to repeat offenders.   Solidarity members of Parliament proposed the extended amnestyto give prisoners another chance under the new government. ManyPoles protested, fearing a mass release of hardened criminals.   The riots were quelled over the weekend when the governmentauthorized the use of force.   Some inmates surrendered as police and guards prepared assaultsand others gave up as police moved in using tear gas and watercannons, according to the state PAP news agency.   Col. Jan Swieczynski, a police spokesman, said the lawenforcement forces did not use firearms.   The worst rioting was at the Czarne prison, in northwesternPoland near the Baltic, which holds 1,500 inmates.   Control was regained after a 50-minute battle. PAP reportedauthorities found the bodies of four prisoners who had been hanged,apparently by fellow inmates, and said two others were killed bybullets. PAP said the prison commander, Capt. Andrzej Laminski, hadordered an investigation into the deaths.   The burned body of one inmate was found in a fire-gutted cell atthe Goleniow prison, also in northern Poland.   Goleniow, with 1,000 prisoners, and another prison in theregion, Nowogard with 850 inmates, were severely damaged by fires,PAP said. Rioting also was suppressed at the Kaminski penitentirarythat houses about 1,000 inmates.   Laminski told PAP that 800 Czarne inmates were transferred toother prisons.   All four prisons are maximum security facilities.   About 17,000 prisoners were expected to benefit from the amnestyprogram approved by the Sejm but it was not applied to those withfour or more convictions.</TEXT></DOC>
