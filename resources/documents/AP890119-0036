The Counter-Inaugural Coalition for a People's Agenda _ agathering of 80 groups ranging from the Gray Panthers to theCommittee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador _ launchedits activities Wednesday evening with a soup kitchen, dubbed a``banquet,'' on the plaza in front of Union Station.   The intended audience was the 2,500 Republican faithful who wereclimbing out of limousines and taxis at the Union Station entrancefor a lavish, $1,500 per ticket feast of Maryland crab and roastveal.   About an hour before the official Union Station dinner was tobegin, several hundred of those who had enjoyed their free meal ofhot chili and rice, tortilla chips, salad and apple cider startedshouting at the gala guests some 100 yards _ and two police lines _away.   ``The extravagance of George Bush's inauguration _ by far themost expensive in U.S. history _ demonstrates how far removed theBush-Quayle administration is from the concerns and worries of mostAmerican people,'' said Lisa Fithian, a spokeswoman for theprotesters.   The protesters' signs reflected their varied interests. Onebanner read, ``House the Homeless, Aid the Poor, U.S. Out of ElSalvador.''   ``What about the homeless?'' they screamed in unison.``Fifty-thousand dead from AIDS. Where was George?''   Park Police officers allowed them to encroach closer to the traindepot than their permit called for. But the officers gotreinforcements _ as well as barricades _ after the shouting started.   But the coalition's 80 groups had agreed in advance not toconduct any civil disobedience because, ``We could only do so muchif we wanted to do it well,'' Fithian said. ``We want to ensure thatwe maintain a positive attitude.'' They kept their word Wednesdaynight.   The screams were barely audible from the Union Station entrance,and the black-tie guests inside expressed little concern about theprotests.   ``I feel it's ridiculous,'' said Seattle business executiveThomas J. Stewart. ``They hold these staged events every timeRepublicans get together and it's in very poor taste.''   Among the events planned by various protest groups are a ``NoHoneymoon'' concert tonight benefiting the Christic Institute, whichhas sued the U.S. government over its Central America policies andactivities. Scheduled to appear are David Crosby, Graham Nash andMichelle Shocked.   In addition, the National Organization for Women plans a silentprotest Friday during the inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue,taking off on Bush's constant references to ``a thousand points oflight.''   The demonstrators will wear buttons number 1 to 1,000 that lightup and carry the message ``Keep Abortion Legal.''   The northwest corner of Lafayette Square, across the street fromthe White House, has been set aside for demonstrations, but there isno hour-by-hour schedule of who will be able to use the space.   Advocates for the homeless and a variety of other problemsalready have called on Bush to ask those who contributed money forthe inaugural celebrations to donate an equal amount to solve thoseproblems.</TEXT></DOC>
