Garcia</HL><DD> 05/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX)PETROLEUM (PET) </IN><TEXT>   While mergers, acquisitions and speculation fueled periodic wild demand for some oil-industry stocks in the past six years, many money managers were steadily decreasing their portfolio holdings of energy issues.    That has abruptly changed, at least temporarily, thrusting the group into the market leadership. Not only are some analysts and money managers warming up to the group again, but a few market strategists are even recommending greater weight for energy stocks in diversified investment portfolios.    &quot;We're going to see some leadership from this group,&quot; says John Connolly, a portfolio strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.    Indeed, that has already happened. According to Indata, a portfolio-monitoring service in Southport, Conn., energy stocks were the best-performing group in the stock market in the 52 weeks ended April 30, gaining nearly 49%.    And during the first four months of this year, the group rose almost 28%, an advance second only to technology stocks, which rose a little more than 36%. The figures are measures of total return, including capital appreciation and dividend reinvestment.    Gains of some individual energy issues this year are even more impressive. For instance, Atlantic Richfield has gained 54%, closing Friday at 92 3/8.    In deciding how much money to invest in which sectors of the stock market, portfolio managers usually use the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index as a benchmark. The index rose a little more than 19% in the four months ended April 30.    About 12% of the Sandamp;P index is made up of energy stocks, including domestic and international oil producers, oil-related supply and construction company stocks as well as coal, gas and pipeline issues.    But, says William T. Kennedy, a pension-fund consultant in Atlanta, the survey of 1,500 portfolios monitored by Indata shows just 8.8% of institutional portfolios are invested in the energy sector, just slightly more than the 8.3% they had in energy at the end of last year.    &quot;Money managers have been underweighted in the best-performing sector of the market for the past 52 weeks,&quot; says Mr. Kennedy.    After watching the price of crude oil drop below $10 a barrel last year, few money managers were eager to make big bets on the stocks. And the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement last fall to restrict production was greeted with a lot of skepticism by the market.    Now there is growing conviction that OPEC has been able to control production and may even be able to raise prices at its meeting late next month. The fundamentals for energy companies have stopped deteriorating and are starting slowly to improve, some analysts say.    Meanwhile, growing interest among portfolio managers in companies that benefit from a more robust economy and somewhat higher inflation has benefited energy issues along with the other commodity-based stocks.    &quot;Frankly, I'm amazed at the strength in the oil sector. It has to be institutional buying that is pushing them up to full valuation levels,&quot; says David Dreman, a managing partner of Dreman andamp; Embry Investment Management in New York. His concern is that many of the oil-producing and oil-service stocks are selling at &quot;pretty high prices relative to this year's earnings.&quot;    Other analysts say that current prices for these stocks already assume higher prices for oil reserves.    But, Mr. Dreman says, OPEC's ability to raise crude prices is still a big uncertainty. He started the year with 12% of his portfolio invested in energy stocks but has reduced that portion to 9% in the past two weeks because of his concern about the outlook for the companies' earnings.    Dean Witter's Mr. Connolly is more sanguine about the group because he believes the risk in owning in oil stocks &quot;is asymmetrical.&quot;    It wouldn't be surprising if crude oil prices decline 10% from current levels in the weeks ahead, because demand for petroleum products typically slows a bit in spring, he says. However, if oil's price rises 10%, &quot;we could have a stampede into these stocks&quot; because they are still underowned by institutions, he says.    Mitzi Malevich, a money manager with IDS Advisory Group in Minneapolis, broke away from the pack last year when she started buying the shares of oil producers. Ms. Malevich added oil-service companies to her portfolios in January.    Although she realizes that it is hard to make a case for owning many of these stocks on basis of higher earnings, especially for oil drillers, she believes a stronger economy will give the issues a boost.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stock prices declined in sluggish trading as investors mostly ignored news of an April unemployment drop, firmer bond prices and a higher dollar.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.36 to 2322.30. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fared worse, falling 1.34 to 293.37, even though decliners on the New York Stock Exchange barely edged gainers, 832 to 739.    Despite the economic news, &quot;there's a fair amount of jitteriness&quot; about the directions of the dollar and interest rates, said Larry Greenwald, co-head of the equity trading desk at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.    This nervousness is prompting investors to take their profits on many recent gainers, Mr. Greenwald said. Technology and oil stocks, big advancers earlier in the week, were hit by profit-taking Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
