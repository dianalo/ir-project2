The electric power generated from 1966 to1986 was 3,167 million KWh, and the average power output was 19,300 KW.Because of the steam dominant type, the reinjection wells of hot waterare not required. Therefore, the facilities were able to be simplified.In the past,the accidents of turbine blades due to breaking, pittingand corrosion occurred. Eleven wells have been dug, and the productionwell which was not able to be used was only one. The steam conditionis 4.0-4.85 kg/cm{sup 2}G, 218`C, and the steam production is stablearound 20 t/h. There has been the difficulty that fine powder has beencontained in steam, and adhered to the turbine. The wells have been dugto the depth of 1,500 m, and the geological structure of steam reservoirwas clarified.(5 figs, 6 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
