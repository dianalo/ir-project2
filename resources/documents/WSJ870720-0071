GalanteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   BRUCE FLEISHER is ready to part with some of his family's heritage. For nearly 30 years, the family has maintained close control of its industrial-supply distribution company in Kankakee, Ill. Now, to keep up with changes sweeping the distribution industry, Mr. Fleisher would like to double the size of the $20 million business through an acquisition. And he is willing to share ownership to do it.    Mr. Fleisher is determined that his family's business will survive a wave of consolidation that is threatening to swamp distributors of all kinds of products. In a report to be released next month, the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors predicts mergers and acquisitions will eliminate 25% of the country's more than 300,000 distributors by 1995. &quot;There is overcapacity in distribution, just as there is overcapacity in manufacturing,&quot; says Steve Samek, director of the wholesaling and distribution practice at Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., which directed the study.    The pressures are so intense that owners like Mr. Fleisher are willing to take steps they have shunned in the past. &quot;I think growth through acquisition is an important enough strategy for us to consider the risk of bringing in outside owners,&quot; he says. Another sign of the family's desire to evolve with the industry: It recently changed the company's name from Kankakee Industrial Supply Co. to Darter Inc. &quot;We didn't want to be limited by our name,&quot; Mr. Fleisher says, adding that Darter, if anything, connotes &quot;speedy.&quot;    THOUGH DISRUPTIVE to distributors, consolidation will benefit consumers. One-third of the country's gross national product passes through distributors on its way to market. As distributors battle for market share, they will cut prices and offer improved services, says Arthur Andersen's Mr. Samek.    That is what happened in areas where consolidation has already occurred. A decade ago, the U.S. had more than 300 pharmaceutical distributors; today, there are about 80. In the competition along the way, Mr. Samek says, &quot;five points have been shaved off profit margins and passed onto consumers in lower prices.&quot;    Consolidation doesn't necessarily mean the end of mom-and-pop distributors. &quot;The small guys probably will always have a niche to fill small orders,&quot; says William F. Jelin, an industry analyst at Chicago Corp., a brokerage firm. &quot;It's the guy in the middle range who really doesn't have a well-defined business plan who is going to be at a disadvantage.&quot;    The distributor association's report outlines several strategies members of the industry will adopt to survive. It says, for example, that the industry will shed its old-fashioned ways and make increasing use of technology to manage inventory and customer relations. It also predicts distributors increasingly will offer special services to win distribution rights from manufacturers.    COMPANIES SUCH AS Vonnegut Industrial Products Corp. are already making some of those changes. The Indianapolis distributor has installed an automated storage and retrieval system to cut personnel costs. One man operates the system, which stores 9,000 different products. By contrast, in an older part of the warehouse, six men are needed to manage 15,000 other items.    &quot;We're getting very heavily into this high-tech stuff,&quot; says Roy D. Sprowl, operations manager. Vonnegut has already automated its own record-keeping functions. Now, it's installing communications links that allow its biggest customers to send orders directly to Vonnegut's computers. That allows Vonnegut to fill the orders faster and more accurately, and to develop a record of what customers need so it can keep the right inventory on hand.    Marshall Electronics Inc. of Chicago has cemented ties with the manufacturers it represents by offering them special services. The British-made MacLaren strollers, popular with American yuppies these days, might not sell so well if Marshall didn't modify them by adding brighter-colored fabric, bigger wheels and seat belts that conform to U.S. safety standards.    &quot;A number of our competitors are falling by the wayside,&quot; says Walter C. Johnsen, vice chairman. &quot;And we're growing, partly because of the services we offer to manufacturers.&quot;    AS THE CONSOLIDATION continues and distributors get bigger, their sources of financing will change, the association says in its report. Retained earnings and bank loans will become less important, while equity and debt raised in the credit markets will be more important. Distributors increasingly will recruit chief executives from outside the family of the owner.    The industry's need for both outside financing and outside management has whetted the interest of venture capitalists, who often can provide both. &quot;There are a lot of smaller distribution companies that don't have the management to grow their business,&quot; says Harvey P. Mallement, managing director of Harvest Ventures Inc. of New York. &quot;They make good acquisition candidates.&quot;    One company Harvest backed, United Refrigerated Services Inc. of Atlanta, acquired several operators of refrigerated warehouses for food distributors over five years. Annual revenue grew to $50 million from less than $10 million. When Harvest sold its interest in United last year, it reaped a pre-tax return equivalent to more than 50% a year on its initial investment.    &quot;The marketplace will pay a higher multiple for a bigger, better-managed distributor than for a smaller one,&quot; Mr. Mallement says. &quot;That's what makes the industry interesting to us.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
