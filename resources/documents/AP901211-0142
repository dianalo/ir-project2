Juan Gomez Martinez, publisher of the daily El Colombiano, saidthe erman was left near the newspaper headquarters. The publisherhas been acting as a spokesman for the families of the kidnappedjournalists.   Buss, a freelance journalist, has lived several years inColombia. He called his Colombian wife, who lives in the northernport of Cartagena, and was quoted as telling her, ``I am herefinishing my stroll.'' Buss had spent 102 days in the custody ofthe Medellin cartel.   The Extraditables, the armed branch of the cartel, released astatement announcing Buss' release as ``recognition of the fightfor the defense of human rights in Colombia and various LatinAmerican countries.''   The statement announced the decision to go along with proposedlegislation that would allow drug traffickers to be tried inColombia and ``procedural guarantees'' of safety.   President Cesar Gaviria took office Aug. 7, 1990, vowing toremain tough against drug trafficking, but hinting that he mightstop extraditions to the United States and other unspecified movesto stop the bloody drug war that has killed hundreds of people thepast year.   Gaviria's predecessor, Virgilio Barco, launched a majoroffensive against the traffickers when Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, thefront-running presidential candidate, was assassinated in August1989 by gunmen employed by Colombia's drug traffickers.   In the following 12 months, Barco's administration allowed 22drug suspects to be extradited to the United States, killedMedellin cartel leader Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, and confiscatedhundreds of properties belonging to the cocaine magnates.   The traffickers are afraid of extradition to the United States,where they are unable to indimidate judges. Many traffickers havebeen freed by Colombian judges under threat of violence or due tobribery.   Buss was the second journalist freed by the traffickers. On Nov.26, Juan Vitta, editor of the weekly Hoy por Hoy was released.   Remaining in the hands of the traffickers are Diana Turbay,publisher of Hoy por Hoy and daughter of former President JulioCesar Turbay Ayala; Francisco Santos Calderoon, editor of theBogota daily El Tiempo; Azucena Lievano, editor of the a TV newsprogram and his two cameramen.   Also held by the Extraditables is Maruja Pachoon, director ofthe government's Film Promotion Board and her sister-in-law BeatrizVillmizar.   Buss said that he did not see the other kidnap victims, but saidhe had been told that the others were fine and would be releasedstarting Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
