The price cut, which is slightly larger than some analysts anticipated, is expected to put more pressure on profit margins for Washington-based MCI. Like other competitors of market-leader ATandamp;T, MCI has been hurt for some time by rising costs and industrywide price cuts. Company officials have said repeatedly that MCI will remain profitable, but that goal is becoming increasingly difficult to attain.    Now, some analysts say prospects for the second-largest long-distance concern are worsening. They say that MCI might report a second-quarter loss from operations, when it will experience the full impact of its latest price cut. In the fourth quarter the company is expected to report a net loss because of a charge for equipment write-downs and restructuring.    William E. Conway Jr., the company's chief financial officer, acknowledged that 1987 would be &quot;a very tough year.&quot; But he declined to comment on whether MCI would report any quarterly losses. He said only that the price cut, which he estimated would reduce annual revenue by about $250 million, would have &quot;a slight negative impact on our margins at the beginning.&quot;    That is because the price cut will be partially offset by a decline in charges that MCI pays to local telephone companies for connections to customers' homes and businesses. Mr. Conway said those savings would amount to &quot;significantly more than half&quot; the revenue he expected to be lost to lower prices.    Mr. Conway said the 10% price reduction on interstate calls is necessary to stay competitive with ATandamp;T. ATandamp;T cut its rates by an average of about 11% on Jan. 1.    The new MCI rates, like ATandamp;T's and those announced last week by No. 3 US Sprint Communications Co., offer the biggest benefits to business customers. MCI said the cost of daytime calls will decline by an average of 13.5%. Rates for WATS services, which already cost significantly less than daytime calls, will drop an average of 3.5%, MCI said. Costs for residential customers will drop an average of 8.5%. US Sprint is a Kansas City, Mo.-based joint venture between GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn., and United Telecommunications Inc., also in Kansas City.    MCI's price advantage, when compared with ATandamp;T, will continue to shrink, however. Day-time business calls will cost an average of 8% to 12% less than those made on ATandamp;T service. The price advantage for residential users, once as high as 50%, will drop to an average of about 3.5%.    The latest price cut reflects &quot;the price differential we feel we have to have to be competitive in the market, particularly with ATandamp;T,&quot; Mr. Conway said. He contended that MCI no longer needs a huge price advantage because the quality of its service has improved. Moreover, he said MCI's target customers -- mainly businesses -- will still enjoy a substantial discount and will benefit from new service features.    But Jack Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said that MCI could have trouble attracting new customers because of its shrinking price advantage. Since the new price reduction will also hurt profit margins, Mr. Grubman characterized it as &quot;a double whammy&quot; for MCI.    &quot;They continue to walk the tightrope between trying to remain profitable and (expanding) market share,&quot; he added. &quot;That's becoming increasingly difficult for them to do.&quot;    Last month, MCI laid off 15% of its work force and announced other steps to cut costs. The measures, which include equipment write-downs, are expected to produce a large charge that will result in a fourth-quarter loss on the order of $500 million, analysts say. In the 1985 fourth quarter, MCI earned $8.3 million, or four cents a share, after unusual items.    MCI's problems indicate that &quot;it's difficult to make money in the long distance business,&quot; says Glenn Pafumi, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MCI closed at $6.875 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
