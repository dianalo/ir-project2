As fears of a recession rose, investors dumped shares of toy companies, machine-tool makers and others whose sales are highly dependent on the strength of the economy. And some moved to traditional safe havens, such as dividend-paying utilities and food and beverage companies that can count on strong demand for their products in good times or bad.    The result: a very wide divergence in the October stock-market performance of various industry groups. &quot;I've never seen anything like this (divergence) in the life of the (recent) bull market,&quot; says Christine Lisec-Pinto, a vice president and investment strategist at Merrill Lynch.    Ms. Lisec-Pinto figures that the divergence among industry groups during the five trading days ended Oct. 21 -- which included the market's shocking 508-point-plunge of Oct. 19 -- was more than twice as great as usual. But that variation narrowed somewhat in the final week of October as the stock market rebounded and investors sought out bargains in the most battered issues.    Overall, the Standard andamp; Poor's index of 500 common stocks declined almost 22% in value last month. The top-performing stocks within that broad universe were the electric utility companies, whose stocks slipped only 3.5%. The prices of toy companies were at the bottom of the list, plunging nearly 42%.    In general, &quot;the industry groups that were hardest hit were the ones that were presumed to be most affected by a slowdown in economic growth,&quot; says Abby Joseph Cohen, an investment policy analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert. That includes makers of discretionary purchases -- such as leisure products, including sporting goods -- as well as machine-tool firms and other manufacturers.    Gold-mining shares, typically purchased as a hedge against inflation, also lost appeal as investors worried instead about a possible recession. The drop in gold shares &quot;is a strong indication that inflation is pretty far down the list of what people are worrying about,&quot; says David M. Blitzer, chief economist for Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Some of the stocks that declined most sharply in October, including offshore-drilling and gold-mining firms, show large gains for the year, even after the October crash. &quot;That would suggest investors are taking the profits out of these areas because they have done well -- taking profits for profits' sake,&quot; says A. Marshall Acuff Jr., portfolio strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    In contrast, the strongest performers in October were what Mr. Acuff calls &quot;the classical defensive types of stocks.&quot; Investors &quot;are running to areas where the growth may be more modest but is more dependable, more predictable. And they will tend to count more heavily on dividend yield as an increment to that growth,&quot; he explains.    Electric utility companies, for example, boast annual dividend yields averaging around 8%. And companies producing consumer staples such as food, beverages and drugs are relatively resistant to economic downturns. &quot;The demand for Coca-Cola is not particularly economy-sensitive,&quot; says Mrs. Cohen of Drexel.    Stocks such as utilities and property/casualty insurance issues are also seen as benefiting from the recent slide in interest rates. And since they have been lagging the market this year, some analysts say they may better withstand any further downturn.    Looking ahead, a number of investment professionals say the continuing decline of the U.S. dollar makes the cyclical industrial companies among the most attractive issues for purchase at today's post-crash prices.    At the same time, some professionals suggest that consumer-staple companies such as food and drug firms that investors have been turning to lately are unlikely to be stellar performers. The San Mateo, Calif., investment advisory firm of Bailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser has been moving out of those issues. Art Micheletti, director of U.S. research, says &quot;we think the economy will continue to grow, but we think it will be done through exports&quot; of manufactured goods, rather than through consumer spending.    Ms. Lisec-Pinto of Merrill Lynch says she thinks food and drug issues &quot;are near exhaustion&quot; after being stock-market leaders for the past few years.    But given the market turmoil, there is little consensus. Mr. Blitzer of Standard andamp; Poor's, for example, remains relatively bullish on the consumer durables and says it is too soon to buy cyclical stocks. &quot;Sooner or later we are going to forget Oct. 19. But it is going to take more than two weeks,&quot; he says. &quot;There is still a lot of defensive posturing. The interest-sensitive stocks and defensive stocks are still a good play.&quot;    ---          Smallest and Biggest Losers    Standard andamp; Poor's industry groups with the best and worstperformaces based on percentage change in stock price fromSept. 30 to Oct. 30    Best Performers    Electric companies              - 3.5%    Telephone                       - 8.1    Property/casualty insurers      -14.0    Beverages-Brewers               -14.6    International oils              -14.7    Household products              -15.2    Multi-line insurance            -15.3    Diversified health care         -15.9    Beverages-Soft drinks           -16.3    Food companies                  -17.2    Drug companies                  -17.4    Medical products, supplies      -18.4    Restaurants                     -18.8    Computer software, servies      -18.9    Worst Performers    Toys                            -41.8%    Machine tools                   -41.3    Leisure time                    -40.3    Miscellaneous metals            -39.4    Gold                            -38.3    Offshore drilling               -38.0    Auto trucks and parts           -36.8    Paper containers                -35.0    Electronics-Semiconductors      -33.9    Tires and rubber goods          -33.8    Manufactured housing            -33.2    Miscellaneous financial         -32.7    Aluminum                        -32.6    Retail department stores        -32.1    Homebuilding                    -31.8    Standard andamp; Poor's 500           -21.8%    Dow Jones Industrials           -23.2   Source: Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
