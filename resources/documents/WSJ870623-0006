A Merc special hearing committee said it expelled Peter R. Constantini from exchange membership and fined him $125,000 for, among other transgressions, writing a check to the brokerage firm that processed his trades that he knew was based on insufficient funds.    Mr. Constantini couldn't be reached.    The exchange alleged that Mr. Constantini also failed to turn in four trading cards for his own account to his clearing member brokerage firm on Feb. 9 for trades executed that day. He submitted the cards the following morning instead, the Merc said.    Mr. Constantini also failed to appear before an exchange investigative hearing, the exchange said.    So far this year, the exchange has levied more than $650,000 in fines against stock-index futures traders. </TEXT></DOC>
