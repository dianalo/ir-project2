Simon emerged as an equity investor in Sir James Goldsmith's bid for B.A.T Industries PLC and said he is a potential buyer of Farmers Group Inc., B.A.T's U.S. insurance unit.    Mr. Simon said he &quot;would clearly be interested in Farmers . . . if it was to be spun off&quot; under Sir James's planned break-up of the British tobacco, financial-services, retailing and paper conglomerate. Sir James wants to keep B.A.T's tobacco business and sell the rest, including Farmers, which B.A.T acquired late last year for $5.2 billion.    In any Goldsmith sale of Farmers, &quot;you have to consider Bill Simon an interested player,&quot; Mr. Simon said in a phone interview.    Since leaving government service, Mr. Simon has become a pioneer of leveraged buy-outs in the U.S., leading an independent investor group. His unexpected intervention in Europe's biggest takeover could lend new credibility to Sir James's campaign to acquire B.A.T. In the past two weeks, Sir James's Hoylake Investments Ltd. investor group has faced mounting skepticism as its efforts to secure U.S. regulatory approval for the #13.35 billion ($21.35 billion) bid have bogged down.    Hoylake has filed nine lawsuits to take the bid's insurance aspects away from U.S. state regulators and put them in federal court. Unveiling his formal offer document, Sir James hinted at ways to surmount U.S. regulatory problems, which he said he had expected. But the 74-page document, while giving details of more terms of the all-paper, highly leveraged offer, left many institutional investors and analysts highly skeptical of its prospects unless the Hoylake group sweetens and restructures it by adding cash.    Mr. Simon stressed that there aren't any firm proposals for a Hoylake sale of Farmers and indicated his interest was preliminary. But he said the investors intend to explore whether &quot;it makes a difference {to U.S. insurance regulators} if we are going to be the acquirer of the spunoff&quot; Farmers unit.    Mr. Simon said that Farmers would be &quot;a pretty big mouthful&quot; and might preclude his interest in other B.A.T units. He noted that other groups may be interested in other B.A.T businesses, which include U.S. retailers Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field.    California, Texas and Kansas state insurance officials said they couldn't speculate as to whether the agencies would respond more favorably to a Simon-led Farmers purchase. But Joseph Hennelly Jr., deputy director of the Arizona Department of Insurance, said, &quot;It's certainly something we'd consider in a hearing.&quot; Several state insurance regulatory officials said they didn't know Mr. Simon and were unaware of his possible interest in Farmers.    According to Hoylake's offer document, Mr. Simon has invested #1 million in the group's planned #868 million of equity. WSGP International Inc., an investment-banking company owned by Mr. Simon and Los Angeles attorney Gerald L. Parsky, has invested another #750,000.    Other investors disclosed yesterday include Britain's Duke of Beaufort; a member of the French Stern banking family; and Baron Philippe Lambert. Britain's General Electric Co., France's Banque Paribas, and Italy's Agnelli family were disclosed earlier as investors.    Acquiring Farmers would be a substantial leap forward for Mr. Simon's ambitions to expand in West Coast financial services. In various ventures, he and Mr. Parsky have acquired both troubled and healthy California savings and loan companies, and have plans to develop a merchant-banking business dealing with the Pacific Rim.    Buying Farmers also would represent a huge step up in size for Mr. Simon. Last year, in his largest single acquisition so far, a Simon-led group spent about $225 million to acquire two thrifts that had total assets of about $4.3 billion.    However, Mr. Simon often has had bigger targets in his sights. During 1987, a group including Mr. Simon and Mr. Parsky talked to federal regulators about taking control of Financial Corp. of America, then the parent of the nation's biggest troubled thrift, with massive government aid. The thrift had about $30 billion in assets but a huge portfolio of troubled real estate loans. The Simon group dropped out of the negotiations, however, after it became clear that the regulators weren't going to move fast and would continue to negotiate simultaneously with other bidders, including Ford Motor Co.    Mr. Simon said the B.A.T deal was an opportunity to expand in Europe. &quot;I want to be involved in the British market and I like everything going on in Europe&quot; as it approaches its 1992 target for removing barriers to a unified market. He said his interest in Hoylake arose when he spoke with Sir James during Britain's Wimbledon tennis championships earlier this summer. Mr. Simon also knows the Agnelli family of Italy, which has invested in some of his U.S. thrift acquisitions.    Sir James is offering B.A.T shareholders an 80%-debt, 20% equity package of securities, which Hoylake's financial advisers currently value at 878 pence a share.    At a news conference, Sir James renewed his attack on B.A.T, saying that if the company &quot;fights on its record, it is dead in the water.&quot; He said Hoylake also hopes to announce soon three trustees to head a voting trust into which Hoylake would put Farmers, another arrangement to surmount U.S. regulatory opposition.    Sir James said it would be &quot;barmy&quot; to make a cash bid and incur hundreds of millions of pounds in investment-banking fees, until he gets a better idea of chances for overcoming U.S. regulatory obstacles. He also said financial advisers Bankers Trust International Ltd., which has invested #20 million in the bidding group, and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., still are exploring ways to provide liquidity for the debt instruments.    Hoylake said the expenses of its bid, if successful, would total about #165 million. Its three financial advisers would share much of that, and could reap substantially more if the offer is underwritten. If the bid is completed, Hoylake's financial advisers would split a $100 million success fee, not less than $50 million of which would go to Drexel. Drexel already has been paid $5 million. Bankers Trust could receive $25 million or more, and Hambros Bank Ltd., Hoylake's U.K. merchant bank, would receive about $30 million.    B.A.T reiterated its criticism of the Hoylake offer and urged shareholders to reject it. &quot;Not only does it ignore the group's excellent prospects but it consists of a bundle of paper of dubious value.&quot; People close to B.A.T also said Mr. Simon, if he eventually makes a proposal for Farmers, might seek a leveraged buy-out that also could run into regulatory roadblocks. On London's Stock Exchange, B.A.T shares gained three pence to 848 pence.    Analysts and institutions remain skeptical about the current Hoylake offer's chances of success. One B.A.T institutional holder said he would be surprised if the current offer drew many acceptances before its first closing date, Aug. 29.    Andrew Threadgold, chief executive officer of Postel, a British institutional investor that controls just over 2% of B.A.T, said the Goldsmith offer document &quot;is the first shot across the bow&quot; of a battle that will run for several more weeks. </TEXT></DOC>
