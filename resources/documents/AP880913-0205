Cordes was accompanied by his wife and German envoys who flew toDamascus, Syria, after his release late Monday in Beirut.   In Damascus, the 55-year-old businessman said, ``I feel I'm bornagain.''   A twin-engine West German military jet carrying the couplearrived at the Cologne-Bonn Airport at 10:20 p.m. (4:20 p.m. EDT)after a five-hour flight from Damascus.   The plane taxied to the military area of the Cologne-Bonnairport, where Cordes was greeted by West German authorities. Thecouple then was taken to an undisclosed location in Bonn.   He is to have a medical examination and is expected to bedebriefed by security officials.   In Damascus, Cordes hugged his tearful wife, Marlene, and thecouple was escorted by Syrian security officers to the ForeignMinistry and turned over to West German officials.   Cordes said in Damascus he nearly despaired during the ordealand he saw none of the other 17 foreign hostages missing inLebanon, including nine Americans.   ``There were moments during which I was feeling so terrible. Butnow that I am a free man again, that I am joining my family,everything seems so far away,'' he told a news conference at theSyrian Foreign Ministry.   ``I'm rejoicing for being a free man again. I feel I'm bornagain. It is as if I have been granted a new life. I am feelingperfect, and I'm in a very good shape,'' he said in German as hegreeted Bonn's German State Minister for Chancery Affairs WolfgangSchaeuble who arrived to escort him home.   Schaeuble, speaking on West German TV, said Cordes told him hiskidnappers ``treated him humanely, but the conditions were hard, hewas always isolated and was always chained.   ``He was moved often and was in a continuous state ofuncertainty. He told me he received few letters from hisrelatives.''   Schaeuble said Cordes was not able to identify the kidnappersbecause they wore masks in his presence.   Cordes, Beirut manager for the Hoechst AG pharmaceuticalcompany, was freed in Beirut at midnight Monday, escorted toDamascus by Syrian officers and spent the night at a governmentguest palace.   There was no further information about the reported abductionand escape of an American engineer identified as Kenneth Wells.   Various reports said Wells was abducted Sunday by gunmen ineastern Lebanon after he married a Lebanese woman. U.S. officialsin Washingotn said Wells subdued his abductors, reached a Syrianarmy checkpoint and was escorted to Damascus where he was turnedover to the U.S. Embassy. They said Wells was employed in SaudiArabia for Litton Industries but they did not know his hometown.   Neither Syrian nor U.S. Embassy officials would comment on thecase Tuesday and Wells could not be located.   Cordes was kidnapped in Beirut Jan. 17, 1987, by Shiite Lebaneseextremists who were seeking to swap him for an Arab jailed inGermany on terrorist charges. Mohammed Ali Hamadi, 24, is beingtried in Frankfurt on murder and air piracy charges in the 1985hijacking a TWA jetliner to Beirut. U.S. Navy diver, Robert Stethemwas killed during the 17-day ordeal.   Hamadi's brother, Abbas, was sentenced to 13 years in prison inApril after he was convicted of kidnapping Cordes and anotherGerman, Alfred Schmidt, in Beirut in January 1987 to try andexchange them for Mohammed.   Schmidt, an engineer, was freed Sept. 7, 1987.   In Bonn, a West German government spokesman who demandedanonymity said he knew of no deal with Iran or with the kidnappersfor Cordes' freedom. The government has repeatedly denied it paid aransom for Schmidt's release.   Cordes appeared healthy, smiled all the time and spokeconfidently.   Asked at the news conference if he had seen any of the other 17foreign hostages held in Lebanon, he said in English: ``I haven'tseen any hostages. I was alone.''   Speaking slowly in a trembling voice, Mrs. Cordes, said inEnglish: `It is wonderful. I couldn't wait for it to happen _ thatour life becomes normal again. It is smashing, so exciting I cannotbelieve it is really happening.''   Cordes' captors, a group calling itself the Holy Warriors forFreedom, said in a statement Monday that they were freeing him inresponse to Iranian and Syrian intervention. The statement did notelaborate.   Cordes was reunited with his wife about two hours before he wasturned over to the German officials at the Syrian Foreign Ministry.   ``She fell into his arms and they kissed each other for a longtime,'' an official who witnessed the reunion said.   Syurian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said: ``On behalf ofPresident Hafez Assad I express how glad that he (Cordes) isreleased and going back home.''   Syria maintains about 40,000 troops in east and north Lebanon aswell as Moslem west Beirut. It has been trying to secure therelease of the foreign hostages most of whom are held by Shiitezealots loyal to Iran.   It is believed that most of the 17 foreigners still missing inLebanon are held by pro-Iranian Shiite kidnappers.   Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondentfor The Associated Press. Anderson, 40, was kidnapped in Beirut onMarch 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
