In a year of rhetoric about the American family, lawmakers haveyet to complete action on major initiatives to raise the minimumwage, expand and improve child care, reform the welfare system andguarantee leave to workers with pressing family responsibilities.   A number of appropriations bills, including one providing about$300 billion for the Defense Department, have been approved in someform, but differences remain between the House and Senate versions.   Also on the incomplete roster is the biggest environmental billof the 100th Congress, a revision of the Clean Air Act tostrengthen the battle against urban air pollution, acid rain andairborne toxic substances.   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has warnedsenators to be prepared for Saturday sessions if the 100th Congressis to end by Oct. 16 _ two weeks beyond the original target datefor finishing business.   The Senate has been mired for days on a bill to raise theminimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 over three years, unable to cutoff a filibuster mounted by conservative Republicans. The weekended with no resolution and a vow to try again this week.   Republican presidential candidate George Bush has becomeinvolved in the debate, saying last week he would support a modestincrease in the minimum wage, but only if it is coupled with alower ``training wage.''   The minimum wage, family leave and child care bills all havebecome entangled in presidential politics, with Democrats trying toget Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., to take positionson social measures he has opposed in the past.   House Democrats jumped on a Bush comment last week which seemedto endorse the family leave act opposed by the administration,saying in a letter that they would welcome his support.   The family leave bill, opposed by small business lobbies, isscheduled for consideration this week. The measure would guaranteeworkers with a newborn, newly adopted or very ill child at least 10weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave. Workers with serious medicalproblems themselves would be entitled to at least 15 weeks of leavewithout losing their jobs.   Welfare negotiators were meeting Monday to discuss the latestoffers and counter-offers on an overhaul bill that would bolsterchild support payments from absent parents and create a major jobs,training and education program for welfare recipients.   ``We haven't given birth yet but we're about in the ninth monthof gestation,'' said Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., as he emerged from ameeting Friday.   His Colorado colleague, Republican Sen. Bill Armstrong, wasslightly less optimistic about the bill's prospects. ``We're justright on the brink _ again,'' he said. ``The conferees clearly wanta bill. The question is can we get something we can sell to ourcolleagues.''   The question is particularly acute in the House, where a handfulof negotiators led by Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., are firmlyopposed to a work requirement for two-parent families on welfare.The Reagan administration is just as firm about its insistence thatthe requirement be included.   The latest Senate offer adds a degree of flexibility to the workrequirement and phases it in starting in 1991. The changes ``didn'tmove Hawkins,'' according to his spokesman, Jay Butler.   But other negotiators appeared headed toward compromise with afinal overhaul costing about $3 billion in the offing. If theyreach agreement, Hawkins and his followers will be outnumbered.   Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,reportedly have agreed on major elements of a compromise,bipartisan child care bill based on the Democrats' $2.5 billion Actfor Better Child Care Services.   The bill would help low-income and, to a lesser extent,middle-income families pay for child care and would require childcare homes and centers receiving federal money to conform tominimum federal health, safety, training and staffing standards.   The powerful National Education Association, along with theParent-Teachers Association, the American Civil Liberties Union andother groups are mounting a campaign against the bill becausechurch-sponsored day care programs would be eligible for aid.   But if the Senate ends up passing a popular bipartisan bill, theHouse is expected to resist the lobbying pressure and follow suit.   Closed-door negotiations over the air legislation have beengoing on for weeks on both sides of the Capitol. Lawmakers aredivided over whether Congress can agree on the complicated packagein the remaining weeks of the session.   Slated for House consideration this week is legislation toauthorize the Corps of Engineers to build about 20 new waterprojects around the nation. The projects still need separateappropriations legislation before they can get under way. The tightmoney situation had caused Congress to vote no money for newprojects this year.</TEXT></DOC>
