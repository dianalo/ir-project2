<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-1267 </DOCNO><TEXT>There is no reason to call for a revision of the atomic energy law, -or a re-enactment of the existing Atomic Energy Act - because the basicframework and structure of the existing Act is as suited to the needsof modern society as are other laws and regulatory provisions in theF.R.G. that are available for dealing with technological or scientificand medical subject matters. A short-term or medium-term prognostic analysisdoes not indicate any changes of circumstances of life drastic enoughto require a complete revision of existing laws. But there is reasonenough to amend parts of the existing Atomic Energy Act, in particularthose governing the licensing requirements, which have to be given amore systematic frame and basis, and those governing the licensing procedure.Amendments in this context should clarify the protection of third-partyrights; the right of participation of the public should be designed inaccordance with the principles applied by the courts in weighing thelegal merits, and the provisions for immediate execution should be designedto form a functional instrument.
