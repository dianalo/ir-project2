Integrated automationmeans to conduct remote surveillance and control of drum cutters andself-advancing supporting pillars. Although grasping the body conditionsof the automated cutter was possible, grasping the conditions aroundthe body such as drum and upper/lower panels, or body and seif-advancingsupporting pillar, etc. and the adaptability of the automated cuttertherefor were not satisfactory. Concerning the self-advancing supportingpillar, a remote control system and a remote surveillance system werecombined with a batch control system. As sensors, respective sensorsfor inner pressure of iron pillar, stroke of iron pillar, inclinationof hinged bar and shifter stroke were installed. Although an ITV camerawas introduced, the field of vision is still narrow and the visibilityis required to be improved. Although the cutters were driven for 62,000minutes in total, almost no big trouble occurred in the automated system,reaching the level of normal operational use. (5 figs, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
