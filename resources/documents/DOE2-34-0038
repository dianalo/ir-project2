Values for effectiveanisotropy field H/sub K//sub eff/ , g value, and exchange constant Awere derived. For Fe on glass, {vert_bar}H/sub K//sub eff/ {vert_bar}was found to increase with increasing thickness. These changes were attributedto stress which decreased with film thickness. The presence of a Cu ora Ti underlayer did not seem to affect H/sub K//sub eff/ for films grownat room temperature. However, Fe/Ti/glass films made at higher substratetemperatures, T/sub s/, did show an increase in {vert_bar}H/sub K//subeff/ {vert_bar}. The appearance of a spin-wave mode in the Fe films enablesus to compute the exchange constant A for Fe, A = (2.12 +- 0.14) x 10{sup-6} ergs cm{sup -1}. The coupling between two thin Fe films through anintervening Cu layer was investigated. A model predicting the numberand position of the peaks in the spectrum as a function of coupling ispresented. From experiment it was observed that the coupling remainsalmost constant through the 50--5-nm Cu thickness range but rises sharplyat 2-nm Cu thickness.</TEXT></DOC>
