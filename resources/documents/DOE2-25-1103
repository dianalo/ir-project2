<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-1103 </DOCNO><TEXT>Discusses design variants of mechanical gyroscopes and their positionson cutting booms of bucket wheel excavators in coal surface mines. Thesegyroscopes determine excavator digging horizons and produce electronicsignals for operating the digging bucket wheel boom. Four schemes ofgyroscope systems controlling the angle of the bucket wheel booms areprovided. They are patented by GDR patents DD 223 753 A 1 (1985), WPE 02 F/2682751 (1986) and WP E 02 F/299 788 (1987). Performance of gyroscopesduring boom slewing and lifting is explained as well as means of attachinginstruments to the boom. Gyroscope signals are displayed for manual boomoperation. They can also be processed for automated boom control. 11refs.</TEXT></DOC>
