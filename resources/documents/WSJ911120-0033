McDonnell Douglas Chairman John McDonnell could hardly bedescribed as a wheeler-dealer chief executive. Over the pastfew years, he has been more associated with defeat, and witha broad restructuring plan that even some company executivesprivately brand as a little flaky.</LP><TEXT>   Colleagues say it was the 53-year-old son of the company'sfounder who led the way to the tentative agreement for TaiwanAerospace to acquire up to 40% of McDonnell Douglas'scommercial airliner business for $2 billion. A final accordwith Taiwan would mark the first step in the formation of anew jetliner company that Mr. McDonnell hopes will eventuallyinclude several other Asian manufacturers.   The prospect may come as a surprise to some. Mr. McDonnellhas been viewed as so unassuming that &quot;sometimes peoplearen't aware of his strategic skills,&quot; says Frederick W.Smith, chairman of Federal Express Corp., a big McDonnellDouglas customer. &quot;They underestimate him.&quot;   The chairman's goal is to create an entity that can gainaccess to the lucrative Pacific Rim market, produce aircraftat far lower cost, and provide sufficient cash to launch thenew MD-12 wide-body plane.   There is a long way to go before the Taiwan deal, muchless the whole U.S.-Asian consortium, is complete.Competitors already are poking at McDonnell Douglas claimsabout the advantages the arrangement is supposed to bring.And some lawmakers say they fear Mr. McDonnell may be givingaway too much technology overseas.   Still, the agreement so far is a moment of triumph for Mr.McDonnell who, until recently, presided over a company thatwas losing lots of money at its Long Beach, Calif., transportaircraft factory. It was a drain that hasn't been interruptedmuch since McDonnell Aircraft took over Douglas Aircraft 24years ago.   Mr. McDonnell tried a massive restructuring at Long Beachin 1989, stripping away layers of management, and evenforcing managers to reapply for their jobs. Mr. McDonnellmaintains that his reorganization has triggered someimprovements.   But insiders say the changes mainly bred discontent. Theyalso say that while Mr. McDonnell rose through the company ina number of financially oriented jobs, he relied too much onbuzz words, and too little on solid fiscal controls.   Either way, the steps initiated two years ago clearlyweren't enough. Through the third quarter of 1991, accordingto Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., McDonnell Douglas had 21 moreairplane orders canceled than it managed to book. Meanwhile,Boeing Co. received 171 new firm orders and Airbus Industriewon 72.   Faced with this, McDonnell Douglas this year hired theconsulting firm McKinsey andamp; Co. to study the commercialairliner market. The report concluded that McDonnell Douglashad to do more than restructure itself; to survive, thereport said, it had to find a way to shake up the entirecommercial airline industry.   The conclusion jolted Mr. McDonnell, who quickly took thelead in finding a solution. Internally, the project becameknown by the code word &quot;D.G.&quot; for &quot;Douglas Global,&quot; and onlya handful of top executives were privy to its details.   It didn't take long for the chairman to begin targetingthe Far East, where many companies and governments have deeppockets, and production costs are cheaper. Further, thePacific Rim represents the world's fastest-growing airlinermarket.   &quot;Despite all the glamour and the complexity of ourindustry, we really are selling a commodity,&quot; Mr. McDonnellsays. &quot;We package a batch of seats that will go a certaindistance. In the final analysis, it's the one who can produceat that lowest cost who's going to have an advantage.&quot;   How much advantage McDonnell Douglas stands to gain is farfrom clear. &quot;What this says about John McDonnell's businessacumen really won't be known for years,&quot; says RobertCrandall, the chairman of American Airlines parent AMR Corp.Yet he praises &quot;John's perseverance&quot; for putting the Taiwandeal in motion, and notes that airlines benefit from having anumber of healthy jet producers around.   The Taiwan deal came together slowly. Mr. McDonnell madethree trips to the Far East, in May, June and October, andmet with Taiwan's president and prime minister. Last month,he ran into Taiwan Aerospace President Denny Ko on the flightto Taipei. Mr. McDonnell says that bit of serendipity madethe negotiations easier.   But mostly, it was hard bargaining. Although the dealwasn't in danger, things seemed to bog down when seniorTaiwan officials didn't give the go-ahead late last week.Then suddenly, the gridlock broke. On Monday, Mr. McDonnellwas en route to Washington, in part to brief U.S. officialson the Taiwan talks, when Taipei signaled that agreement wasreached. He got the good news as he walked into McDonnellDouglas's offices near the Pentagon.</TEXT></DOC>
