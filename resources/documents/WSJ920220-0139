While some of the bearish factors could pass during thenext few weeks, the analysts said, the market probably willbe grim until then.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, London share prices dropped sharply on the joltthat President Bush's political standing took in the NewHampshire primary election, and Frankfurt stocks eased onprofit-taking.   On Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index, whichslumped 452.95 points a day earlier, lost 253.73, or 1.22%,to 20618.30, its lowest close since Oct. 1, 1990, when theindex registered 20221.86.   In Tokyo on Thursday, the Nikkei index edged up 19.14points to close the morning session at 20637.44.   Wednesday's volume was an estimated 200 million shares, upfrom 184.6 million Tuesday. Losers outpaced gainers, 732-219,and 151 shares were unchanged. The Tokyo Stock Price Index ofall first-section issues, which fell 19.84 points Tuesday,dropped 19.37, or 1.26%, to 1520.62.   The Nikkei has closed below 21000 five times this year,and despite considerable volatility, recoveries haven't takenthe index above 22000 since Feb. 7.   &quot;We're weak,&quot; Alan Livsey, technical analyst at KleinwortBenson International, said. &quot;When you look at a chart of thepast year, we've been making new lows since the end of theGulf War.&quot; But he noted that the low-price, low-volume markethas tended to make sell-offs smaller than they were at theend of 1991, possibly an indication that the bear market ofthe past two years is running out of steam.   Wednesday's drop &quot;is a very poor signal,&quot; said NorioYamaguchi, general manager of investment strategy at ABN AmroSecurities (Japan) Ltd., &quot;but it can also happen at the finalstage of a bottom&quot; for the market.   In the near term, any rebound is likely to be subdued,however. The market is coping with various politicalscandals, recent poor corporate earnings forecasts andpressure on corporations to sell stock funds to clean uptheir books ahead of the fiscal year's end on March 31.   In the past, political scandals often have had littleinfluence on the market in Japan. But in this case, timing isan important factor.   &quot;If the (government's) budget is delayed (by thescandals), it will hurt the private sector,&quot; which sorelyneeds a stimulus from public-works spending, said FukuoKawakubo, assistant manager for research at Nomura SecuritiesCo. With that in mind, he said, &quot;the market isn't surewhether it will break 20000.&quot; The Japanese budget is normallysupposed to be passed by April 1, but wrangling overtestimony by scandal-tainted politicians has delayedparliamentary budget deliberations.   It wasn't clear how long the scandals would shake Japan,but stock-fund selling and most corporate earningsannouncements will pass within about a month.   Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry is likely to give up plansto sell 500,000 government-held shares of Nippon Telegraph andamp;Telephone in the current fiscal year because of the stockmarket slump, a Japanese news report said. The government issaid to believe the sale could cause the market to declinefurther. Separately, NTT lowered its earnings projection forthe current fiscal year, saying pretax profit will be lessthan its September estimate of 375 billion yen ($2.93billion).   Among corporate developments, Honda Motor fell 10 yen to1,440 yen ($11.25). Group pretax profit for the third quarterended Dec. 31 dropped 24% to 21.94 billion yen from a yearearlier. Honda cited the stronger yen and company operatingexpenses that grew more quickly than sales. Sony skidded 160,or 3.8%, to 4,000. The technology and consumer productscompany's consolidated operating profit for the third quarterended Dec. 31 slumped 17% to 78.6 billion yen. Net incomejumped 94% to 97.2 billion yen, but that reflected a gain of61.5 billion yen in the latest quarter from the sale of stockin a unit. Sony forecast a 45% plunge in operating profit forthe fiscal year and slashed 70 billion yen from itscapital-spending plans for the next fiscal year.   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex ended down 19.2 points at 2536.7. The FT 30-stock indexdeclined 8.4 points to 1975.3. Volume was 561.3 millionshares, compared with 559.3 million a day earlier.   London investors expected the U.S. presidential primaryoutcome to bode poorly for Wall Street. Their gloom worsenedbecause of Tokyo stocks' losses and worse-than-expectedprovisional British retail sales data for January.   In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-stock index declined 7.2 pointsto 1687.79, only fractionally above the intraday low. Buyershave disappeared and profit-taking has set in each time theDAX has approached the 1700 level, as it did Monday and onthree other occasions in the past four weeks.   In other corporate developments, in London, BritishAerospace surged 30 pence, or 11%, to 303 pence ($5.31). Thedefense contractor and auto maker posted a 1991 pretax lossof #81 million ($142 million), reversing a year-earlierprofit of #376 million, as a #235 million restructuringcharge was applied to recession-damaged results. Theperformance was in line with the company's previous forecastand better than the market expected. British Aerospacemaintained its dividend at 25 pence a share. Lloyds Bank fell7, or 1.8%, to 386. The bank's 60%-owned Lloyds Abbey Lifesaid its 1991 pretax profit slipped 4.2% to #305.5 million asstrong growth from its core insurance operations was offsetby the effect of the recession on the insurer's finance andreal estate activities.   Turbulent early trading in stocks of U.S. pharmaceuticaland biotechnology companies spread across the Atlantic todepress Britain's big drug stocks. Glaxo Holdings tumbled 22to 826, SmithKline Beecham Class A shares lost 26 to 924.5,and Wellcome shed 29 to #11.13 ($19.51).   In Paris, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer plummeted 14.30 Frenchfrancs, or 4%, to 344.50 francs ($61.51). The Frenchstate-controlled chemical and pharmaceutical concern's 1991group operating profit, after paying minority interests, rose3.2% to two billion francs ($357.8 million). But the resultswere slimmer than expected.   In Bangkok, Thai Airways International, the state-ownedcarrier, announced an initial public offering March 16-27 of95 million shares at 60 baht ($2.37) a share; an additionalfive million shares will be reserved for airline employees atthe par price of 10 baht a share.   ---   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital InternationalPerspective, Geneva.
