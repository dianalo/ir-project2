Recently, this technique has been appliedto streak cameras with excellent results. Two complementary techniqueshave emerged in which accurate synchronization of the streak camera deflectionwith the laser has been achieved. In each case, temporal fluctuation(jitter) has been reduced to the level of the streak camera resolution(-- 1 psec). The authors discuss several novel applications of the streakcamera that utilize the unique properties of these photoelectrons. Thefirst illustrates the concept of fast electrical switching in a semiconductorunder excitation by a picosecond electron burst. A gain of {approx_equal}10/sup 3/ over photoconductive gain is observed with 15-keV photoelectrons.The second example deals with the sampling of fast electrical transientspropagating on a transmission line by monitoring the deflection of thepicosecond photoelectron pulse produced by its interaction with the electricfield of the transmission line. Finally, they discuss an applicationusing the wavelike nature of the photoelectrons to generate electrondiffraction patterns of thin specimens. This technique should be particularlyuseful in the future to time resolve picosecond laser-induced structuralchanges such as those occurring in laser annealing.</TEXT></DOC>
