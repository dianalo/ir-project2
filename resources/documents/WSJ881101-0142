Researchers at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta are testing the long-term effects on the eyes of sodium lauryl sulfate, or SLS, an ingredient of many soaps and shampoos. SLS, until now, has been considered safe since no one has seen any obvious damage to human or animal eyes. &quot;Due to the widespread use of such detergents where exposure to the eye may occur, any immediately dangerous situations should have been readily observable,&quot; Georgia ophthalmology professor Keith Green told a meeting last month of the nonprofit Research to Prevent Blindness organization.    But new test-tube and animal experiments hint at potential problems, Dr. Green says. The experiments found that SLS is rapidly absorbed by eyes, particularly the eyes of young, growing animals. It is retained there in the eye for several days and causes some mysterious changes in certain proteins. And it delays the healing of wounds in the surface of the cornea.    &quot;Our findings lead us to call for more judicious use of detergents such as SLS&quot; by both manufacturers and consumers, Dr. Green says. &quot;This is particularly true when possible accidental exposure to SLS could occur in infants, where growth is occurring, and in any instance where a healing process occurs.&quot;    Expanding Uses for Way   To Clean Up Exhaust   REDUCING factory emissions that cause acid rain and smog may become practical through a new method.    Two years ago, researchers at the federally owned Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif., reported a lab experiment in which polluting nitric oxide compounds were eliminated from diesel exhaust by adding a simple chemical, cyanuric acid, to the exhaust gases. The technique worked over a wide range of temperatures, as low as 350 degrees Celsius.    But last month, in the scientific journal Nature, another research team reported that the Sandia results could only be achieved in a stainless steel tube, as at Sandia, or at temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius or higher. That raised questions about the practicality of the technique for factory and power-plant furnaces.    Now, Micheal Heap, president of Energy andamp; Environmental Research Corp. in Irvine, Calif., and his associate, David W. Pershing, of the University of Utah, report that in further experiments, they discovered a way to make the Sandia method work without stainless steel and over a wide range of temperatures. The cyanuric acid is added early in the combustion process when the fuel-air mixture is rich in fuel and then, &quot;downstream,&quot; a blast of air is injected into the combustion gases. This simulates the so-called staged combustion technique already being used by some utilities and prevents certain unburned chemicals from turning into nitric oxides.    In an experimental coal-burning furnace, the combination of staged combustion and cyanuric acid cut nitric oxide emissions to 40 parts per million of exhaust gases from more than 1,000 ppm, the researchers reported. Better yet, ammonium sulfate, a cheap and plentiful fertilizer, worked just as well as cyanuric acid, a swimming-pool additive.    New Method for Finding   Cause of Chest Pain   DETERMINING whether chest pain is caused by heartburn or heart disease should become more of a science as a result of experiments at Bowman Gray Medical College in Winston-Salem, N.C.    When doctors have trouble diagnosing chest pain, they often inject hydrochloric acid into the esophagus to see if it reproduces the chest pain. If so, the pain is considered a result of &quot;gastroesophageal reflux,&quot; the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus. A negative result points doctors to other causes, probably angina heart pain caused by clogged coronary arteries.    The Bowman Gray research questions the accuracy of this 30-year-old acid test. In an innocuous office procedure, the researchers slipped a tiny acid detector through the nose and into the esophagus of 35 patients whose chest pains had been blamed on acid reflux by the old test. After monitoring acid levels with the detectors for a full day in each patient, the researchers found that only 20 of the 35 actually suffered abnormally high acid levels in the esophagus.    Similarly, 14 of 36 chest-pain patients who supposedly were free of acid-reflux problems by the old test did, in fact, have abnormally high acid levels in the esophagus. The old acid test is only 60% reliable, Edward G. Hewson of the Bowman Gray research team told a recent meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology.    Twenty-four hour monitoring of acid levels in the esophagus with the tiny acid detector and of heart function with a strap-on electrocardiogram promises to be more accurate in distinguishing the source of unexplained chest pain, the researchers say.    Odds and Ends   THE WORLD'S tiniest barcoded label -- smaller than 0.09 inches square -- is being developed by Intermec Corp., Lynwood, Wash., and U.S. Agriculture Department scientists in Tucson, Ariz., who want to barcode bees so they can use a laser scanner to identify which are entering and leaving the hive, reports the trade magazine ID Systems. . . .
