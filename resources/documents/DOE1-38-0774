<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-38-0774 </DOCNO><TEXT>GaAs bipolar transistors have not seen the major development effort thatGaAs MESFETs have due primarily to the short minority carrier lifetimesin GaAs. The short minority carrier lifetimes require that the base regionbe very thin which, if done by implantation, requires that the dopingbe high to obtain a well defined base profile. These requirements arevery difficult to achieve in GaAs and typically, if high current gainand high speed are desired for a bipolar technology, then heterostructurebipolars are the appropriate technology, although the cost of heterostructuredevices will be prohibitive for some time to come. For applications requiringlow current gain, more modest fabrication rules can be followed. Lateralbipolars are particularly attractive since they would be easier to fabricatethan a planar bipolar or a heterojunction bipolar. Lateral bipolars donot require steps or deep contacts to make contact with the subcollectoror highly doped very thin epilayers for the base region and they candraw upon the semi-insulating properties of the GaAs substrates for deviceisolation. Bipolar transistors are described and shown to work successfully.</TEXT></DOC>
