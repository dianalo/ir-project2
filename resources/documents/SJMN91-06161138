Among them were Supervisors ZoeLofgren and Mike Honda, San Jose Councilwoman Blanca Alvarado, and mayoralaide Bob Brownstein. Supervisor Rod Diridon, state Sen. Al Alquist and U.S.Rep. Norman Mineta also appeared, though they left early. Conspicuously absentwere Dianne McKenna and Ron Gonzales, the two supes with the closest ties tohigh-tech companies targeted by the so-called Justice for Janitors campaign.;   The issue places Gonzales in an awkward situation. Although never close toorganized labor, Gonzales was elected in 1988 with strong grass-roots supportfrom the Hispanic community and generous financial backing from Silicon Valleycorporations. Now Hispanic leaders are attacking some of those corporations,including Gonzales' former employer, Hewlett-Packard, for hiring non-unionjanitorial firms.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SWEEPING UP AFTER THE PARTY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Insider  </MEMO><TEXT>     Gonzales' staff told us that the supervisor didn't attend because of aroutine scheduling conflict. But his father, Bob Gonzales, was thererepresenting the county Human Relations Commission. And the supervisor sent anaide, Cindy Chavez, who announced that her boss had already signed a letterurging corporate execs to meet with union leaders. Chavez told us thatGonzales is still awaiting a response to a missive he sent to Apple ComputerCEO John Sculley.;  A STRAIGHT FLUSH;    Now that Joe McNamara has departedthe San Jose Police Department, don't be surprised if there's a settlement inthe Garden City card club case. McNamara was always the most vociferousadvocate of closing Garden City down, a condition that made settlement of thecriminal charges against a dozen-odd card club principals and employeesdifficult. We hear that Superior Court Judge John McInerny is sitting downwith Deputy DA Julius Finkelstein and the lawyers for Nick and Chris Dalis,against whom the weight of evidence in the skimming case is thought to beheaviest. Insiders are betting Chris Dalis may escape a jail term because ofage, but that a settlement will mandate some kind of time for Nick Dalis.Meanwhile, there are rumbles at City Hall that Garden City -- which is doingphenomenally well with its new Asian games -- may seek an expansion.;  THECOWPOKE;    U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Ivory Tower, has gotten a nice ride inthe press recently, especially after a full-page Wall Street Journal ad thatboasted the endorsements of industrial leaders like Hewlett-Packard founderDavid Packard, Arco chairman Lodwrick Cook, Apple boss John Sculley and formerSecretary of State George Shultz. Last week at the Sculleys' horse ranch, hepicked up $500,000 from the region's high-tech execs. But Campbell's earlystrength could well be a point of attack if he makes it past the primary.Ex-Gov. Jerry Brown, a candidate for the Democratic nomination, told Merc Newspolitics watchdog Phil Trounstine that he intends to make a class assault onCampbell. Said His Moonbeam, an unlikely but apparently eager populist: &quot;He(Campbell) is the captive of the top 1 percent of the people who, with hismoral and political support, increased their income by more than 100 percentin the past decade, while the vast majority of the people were seeing theirshare of the American dream decline.&quot; Now, if we can just boil that messageinto a sound bite.;  SEE SPOT RUN;    San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer may haveplayed a bit dirty in the last campaign. But she hasn't completely lost hersense of humor about herself. Last Tuesday, a delegation of pupils from theschool of Supervisor Zoe Lofgren's daughter, Sheila, attended a councilmeeting. Hammer welcomed them and explained that the original idea had beenfor the mayor to visit the class and read. Then she jestingly explained thather reputation as a poor oral reader had preceded her (It's true: Hammerdelivers prepared remarks in a fashion that makes Walter Mondale seemdynamic.) Better, all in all, to have the students visit the council meeting.; IACOCCA TIME;    How sweet it is: A veteran San Jose cop who hasn't written atraffic ticket in two years came close last week. But after getting an angrytirade from the driver's wife, he settled for a few well-chosen words. Whenthe man was pulled over for speeding, his wife angrily complained to the cop,demanding to know why the officer was hassling law-abiding folks instead ofchasing down real criminals. At the end of the torrent, the officer turned tothe passenger's husband and said simply: &quot;I'm happy to see your air bag isworking.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  The Insider is compiled by Mercury News reporters.
