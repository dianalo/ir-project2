A final ruleon this subject was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> June 12, 1981 (46 FR 31206 et seq.), and wasamended October 22, 1982 (47 FR 47172 et seq.). The current proposed amendmentrestructures the part into three separate subparts to improve clarity andorganization. In subpart A (General), a section on definitions is added.In subpart B (Lost-Time Wages), the standard rate of payment of lost-timewages is set at 75%. This eliminates the need for staff to make a determinationof dependent support. The subpart also adds the ability to terminate lost-timewages if the recipient is placed into Disciplinary Segregation. SubpartC (Compensation for Work-Related Physical Impairment or Death) modifiesthe time parameters for filing a claim. A claim could be filed no morethan 45 days prior to the date of an inmate's release, but no less than15 days prior to the release date. This modification provides a 15 dayperiod prior to release in which the claimant may be examined by Bureaumedical staff. A section on review of entitlement is added. This sectionprovides that each monthly compensation recipient shall be required tosubmit to periodic medical examinations to determine the current statusof their physical impairment. It also provides for a reduction in compensationbenefits where excessive income is received by the claimant. The subpartalso provides for suspension of benefits where a monthly compensation recipientis subsequently incarcerated. Finally, the subpart incorporates a titlechange from ``Associate Commissioner'' to ``Chief Operating Officer.''Interested persons may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submittingdata, views, or arguments in writing to the Bureau of Prisons, Room 760,320 First Street NW., Washington, DC 20534. Comments received during thecomment period will be considered before final action is taken. The proposedrule may be changed in light of the comments received. No oral hearingsare contemplated.The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a major rulefor the purpose of EO 12291. After review of the law and regulations, theDirector, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purposeof the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), does not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 301</ITAG>Prisoners.<ITAG tagnum="6">J.

No claim for compensationwill be approved if full recovery occurs while the inmate is in custodyand no impairment remains at the time of release. (b) In determining the amount of accident compensation to be paid, thepermanency and severity of the injury in terms of functional impairmentshall be considered. The provisions of the Federal Employees' CompensationAct (FECA) (5 U.S.C. 8101, et seq.) shall be followed when practicable.The FECA establishes a set number of weeks of compensation applicable forinjuries to specific body members or organs (Section 8107). (c) All awards of Inmate Accident Compensation shall be based upon theminimum wage (as prescribed by the Fair Labor Standards Act).(1) For body members or organs covered under Section 8107, the minimumwage applicable at the time of the award shall be used as the basis fordetermining the amount of compensation. Awards regarding injury to bodymembers or organs covered under Section 8107 shall be paid in a lump sum.Acceptance of such an award shall constitute full and final settlementof the claim for compensation. (2) For body members or organs not covered under Section 8107, awards willbe paid on a monthly basis because such awards are subject to periodicreview of entitlement. The minimum wage applicable at the time of eachmonthly payment shall be used in determining the amount of each monthlypayment. Monthly payments are ordinarily mailed the first day of the monthfollowing the month in which the award is effective. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 301.315 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Review of entitlement </ITAG>(a) Each monthly compensation recipient shall be required, upon requestof the Claims Examiner, to submit to a medical examination, by a physicianspecified or approved by the Claims Examiner, to determine the currentstatus of his physical impairment. Any reduction in the degree of physicalimpairment revealed by this examination shall result in a commensuratereduction in the amount of monthly compensation provided. Failure to submitto this physical examination shall be deemed refusal, and shall ordinarilyresult in denial of future compensation. The cost associated with thisexamination shall be borne by Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (b) Inasmuch as compensation awards are based upon the minimum wage, anyincome received by a compensation recipient which exceeds the annual incomeavailable at the minimum wage (based upon a 40 hour work week), includingSocial Security or veterans benefits received as the result of the work-relatedinjury for which Inmate Accident Compensation has been awarded, shall bedeemed excessive. The amount of compensation payable to a claimant withan income deemed excessive shall be reduced at the rate of one dollar foreach two dollars of earned and benefit income which exceeds the annualincome available at minimum wage. Each monthly compensation recipient shallbe required to provide a statement of earnings on an annual basis, or asotherwise requested. Failure to provide this statement shall result inthe suspension or denial of all Inmate Accident Compensation benefits untilsuch time as satisfactory evidence of continued eligibility is provided.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 301.316 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Subsequent incarceration of compensation recipient.</ITAG>If, subsequent to an award of compensation on a monthly basis, a claimantbecomes incarcerated at any federal, state, or local correctional facility,monthly compensation payments payable to the claimant shall ordinarilybe suspended until such time as the claimant is released from the correctionalfacility.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 301.317 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Medical treatment following release.</ITAG>Federal Prison Industries, Inc., may not pay the cost of medical, hospitaltreatment, or any other related expense incurred after release from confinementunless such cost is authorized by the Claims Examiner in advance, or theClaims Examiner determines that circumstances warrant the waiver of thisrequirement. Generally, the payment of such costs is limited to impairmentevaluations, or treatments intended to reduce the degree of physical impairment,conducted at the direction of the Claim Examiner.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 301.318 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Civilian compensation laws distinguished.</ITAG>The Inmate Accident Compensation system is not obligated to comply withthe provisions of any other system of worker's compensation except wherespecifically stated in this part. Awards made under the provisions of theInmate Accident Compensation procedure differ from awards made under civilianworkmen's compensation laws in that hospitalization is usually completedprior to the inmate's release from the institution and, except for a three-daywaiting period, the inmate receives wages while absent from work. Otherfactors necessarily must be considered that do not enter into the administrationof civilian workmen's compensation laws.
