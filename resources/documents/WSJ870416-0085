Operating profit actually fell, said executives at the company's annual meeting here. James E. Olson, the New York-based company's chairman, said results were &quot;somewhat better than expected,&quot; because of cost cutting; however, some industry analysts didn't see much to cheer about, because earnings were boosted by factors that may not be repeated.    ATandamp;T shares were the most active in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, closing at $24.75, up 75 cents.    First-quarter profit rose to $445 million, or 40 cents a share, from last year's restated $354 million, or 31 cents a share. However, last year's operating profit was actually $529 million, or 47 cents a share; it was reduced by $175 million, or 16 cents a share, by a change in accounting for depreciation prior to 1986. The $175 million was part of a $1.7 billion charge ATandamp;T took last year to also account for job cuts, facility consolidations and inventory write-downs.    Analysts said that most worrisome was a 6.7% decline in total revenue, to $8.12 billion from $8.71 billion a year earlier. &quot;Their markets haven't responded&quot; to new products or improved marketing, said Maria Sbrilli, an analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;They can't keep taking costs off the books and not generate any revenue growth. At some point, you run out of assets to write off.&quot;    Rental revenue fell nearly 20% as a result of more customers buying equipment instead of renting it, and ATandamp;T said it expects rental revenue to continue to annually decline at that level. Revenue from long-distance service fell 2.1%, mostly because of price cuts.    &quot;ATandamp;T is misleading investors by picturing the results as better than expectations, because they are just better than what was a worst-case scenario,&quot; said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. &quot;They aren't better than a year ago and where International Business Machines Corp. can point to signs of growth, ATandamp;T can't.&quot;    Not all analysts were bearish; Glenn Pafumi of Dean Witter Reynolds called ATandamp;T's first quarter &quot;fabulous&quot; and praised Mr. Olson's efforts to cut costs.    In remarks to reporters, Mr. Olson acknowledged that &quot;product volume continues to be softer than we'd like,&quot; including computer sales. Some analysts attributed most of the decline in product sales to lower shipments rather than price cuts. Mr. Olson wouldn't comment on order rates, but analysts said ATandamp;T's investor-relations bulletin warned that &quot;a near-term recovery in product sales isn't anticipated.&quot;    Still, Mr. Olson said, &quot;I'm convinced that with the refocusing of the sales force, product sales will improve.&quot; ATandamp;T has combined its equipment and long-distance sales force. Overall, Mr. Olson said, &quot;I find the first-quarter results encouraging as we look ahead.&quot;    Analysts aren't certain whether ATandamp;T can sustain its current level of earnings through cost cutting. &quot;That is the question,&quot; said Robert M. Kavner, ATandamp;T's chief financial officer. ATandamp;T last year indicated it would be difficult to increase earnings this year from last year's $1.26-a-share &quot;earnings base,&quot; which took into account only part of its charges against earnings.    Robert Morris III of Prudential Bache said eight cents of ATandamp;T's first-quarter results came from such non-operating factors as a lower tax rate, lower interest costs and lower preferred dividend payouts. &quot;I wouldn't annualize the 40 cents and say they can earn $1.60 for the year,&quot; said Mr. Morris.    Cost cutting in the first quarter was most evident in improvement in gross profit margins on equipment, to 42% of sales from 34.8%. Mr. Grubman of PaineWebber warned, however, that part of this improvement was because of charges in last year's fourth quarter that reduced inventory values and may not represent continuing cost savings. &quot;Revenue will probably be down $2 billion this year, so they better cut costs just to stay even,&quot; Mr. Grubman said. Cost cutting &quot;isn't keeping up with the revenue decline.&quot;    But Mr. Kavner said product margins also improved because of tighter control over inventory and a &quot;real reduction in our cost structure&quot; from job cuts. ATandamp;T's employment fell to 306,000 at the end of the first quarter from 317,000 at the end of last year.    At the annual meeting, shareholders approved an increase in the number of the company's authorized common shares to 1.5 billion from 1.2 billion. ATandamp;T has said the shares could be used for a variety of purposes, including acquisitions. Mr. Kavner said that while acquisitions continue to be studied, &quot;right now, we don't have anything&quot; that is being specifically looked at as an acquisition. </TEXT></DOC>
