The resultant decrease in heat of fusionor crystallization, that in weight, and so forth were discussed in relationwith the progress of oxidation. The thermal stability of those materialsdiffered markedly with their substituents. The addition of radical scavengersbrought the remarkable suppression on the progress of thermal deteriorationof those materials in open atmosphere.</TEXT></DOC>
