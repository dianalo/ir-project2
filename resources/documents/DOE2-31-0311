Direct MBMS sampling of the vapors allows rapidanalysis of complex gas-phase species: (1) the pyrolysis products andthe degree of conversion to hydrocarbons for the major compound classes;(2) the yields of water and carbon oxides, compounds in which rejectedoxygen appears; (3) the composition of organic catalyst products, whichcontain olefins, alkanes, substituted benzenes, furans, and naphthalenes.Methods have been developed that allow yield estimates of the major products,based on the MBMS results. Three of the important parameters influencingyields and product distributions have been systematically screened: temperature;weight hourly space velocity; and feed partial pressure. The effectsof these major variables have been studied over the complete catalystlife from initial exposure of the fresh catalyst to the pyrolysis vaporto the breakthrough of feed vapors due to coke deposition and deactivation.These studies have indicated an additional mechanism of aromatic hydrocarbonformation from biomass pyrolysis is present that is not observed in methanolconversion. Studies in steam, rather than the presently used Helium,are indicated. 18 references.</TEXT></DOC>
