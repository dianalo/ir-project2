He was sure that experience had taught him patience -- until he had to deal with the U.S. Congress.    Mr. Swindle is in charge of the Economic Development Administration, which funnels federal funds to local communities, usually for public-works projects. Its $180 million grant budget is intended for areas of economic distress, but Congress routinely pushes through dubious projects to benefit local interests. What galls Mr. Swindle is that some Members are now forcing him to ignore every law in the book so they can drag home EDA funds.    During conference work on the 1987 continuing resolution Senator Ernest Hollings slipped in a requirement that the EDA approve &quot;without further requirement or delay&quot; a $3.5 million grant to Lexington County, S.C., for construction of a fiber-optics facility. The chief beneficiary is the Pirelli Cable Corp., a foreign-owned, for-profit company, which will pay the remaining $6 million of the project's cost. Local unemployment is 4%.    An angry Mr. Swindle finally signed the approval papers for the grant last year, but noted that this &quot;noncompetitive, unconditional, ineligible grant is reluctantly made to Lexington County for the primary and almost exclusive use of the Pirelli Corp.&quot; He also complained that Congress &quot;has directed that the funds be disbursed without regard to laws designed to protect civil rights {and} the environment.&quot;    Pirelli can use the facility by merely making annual lease payments that total $415,000 over the next 15 years. Pirelli may then keep the facility for one final payment of $200,000. The current discounted value of these payments is only $245,000 or 6% of the federal subsidy.    Rep. Joe Early decided his hometown of Worcester, Mass., needed a biotechnology center and supported the city's application for a $1 million EDA grant to build roads and sewers. Because Worcester has a jobless rate of only 3%, city officials insisted the project's 2,500 jobs were needed to aid &quot;pockets of distress&quot; in the city. Mr. Swindle wanted to ensure that a portion of the jobs created would go to people in census tracts the city deemed &quot;distressed.&quot; The city refused any conditions on the grant.    Soon Rep. Early had not only persuaded Congress to mandate giving the EDA grant to Worcester but also to exempt the project from such statutes as the Civil Rights Act, the Copeland &quot;Anti-Kickback&quot; Act, the Clean Air Act, laws requiring access for the handicapped and curbs on the use of lead paint. However, the project must follow Davis-Bacon provisions mandating that union wages be paid.    &quot;There were threats from staffers on the Appropriations Committee that other EDA programs would be in jeopardy if I did not waive those laws,&quot; Mr. Swindle says. &quot;I was told I had to do it.&quot; Last month he released the money, no strings attached.    Mr. Swindle could complain to congressional leaders about these misuses of the legislative process, but that would be a dead end. Last year, House Speaker Jim Wright earmarked $11.8 million in EDA funds for development of the Fort Worth Stockyards. Mr. Swindle says the grant is 20 times larger than the average EDA grant, and that the &quot;folks at the stockyards didn't even know what they wanted the money for.&quot; However, the grant was made at a time when a business partner of Mr. Wright's, George Mallick, had a financial interest in the project.    The Reagan administration has often tried to kill the EDA program, but its congressional value appears too great as a pipeline for distributing cash and favors. That EDA grants may have strayed far from their original purpose -- such as helping &quot;distressed areas&quot; -- has become quite irrelevant. </TEXT></DOC>
