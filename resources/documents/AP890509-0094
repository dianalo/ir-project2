The most recent loss was a Soviet Mike-class submarine off thecoast of Norway April 7, with two nuclear reactors aboard, saidJoshua Handler, one of the Greenpeace activists who prepared thereport.   The most serious loss was a Soviet Yankee-class submarine thatsank in the Atlantic Ocean Oct. 6, 1986, off the coast of Bermuda.Yankee-class subs are believed to carry 16 SS-N-6 ballisticmissiles, with two warheads apiece, and to be powered by twonuclear reactors, according to Western defense analysts.   Greenpeace said that most of the nuclear weapons and reactorslittering the ocean floor were lost at sea by the Soviet Union,which despite its new-found openness remains far more secretiveabout its nuclear armaments than does the United States.   Handler, interviewed by telephone Monday, declined to provide acomplete list of the 48 nuclear weapons and 11 reactors he believesare on the ocean floor. He said a full list of the nuclear devicesGreenpeace believes are on the ocean floor will be released nextmonth.   Known incidents include:   _The Soviet Mike-class submarine, April 7, 1989, with tworeactors.   _The Soviet Yankee-class submarine in 1986, with 32 warheads andtwo reactors.   _A Soviet November-class submarine in 1970, with two reactors.   _The U.S. submarine Scorpion, in 1968, with one reactor.   _The U.S. B-43 bomb from the Ticonderoga in 1965.   _The U.S. submarine Thresher, in 1963, with one reactor.   Sixteen years after the Okinawa accident, the U.S. Navyacknowledged it had lost a B-43 bomb aboard an A-4 attack plane offthe aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga on Dec. 5, 1965, as the shipsteamed toward port in Japan after bombing missions off Vietnam.   In its 1981 statement, the Navy said the incident had taken tookplace ``more than 500 miles from land ... at sea in the Pacific.''   But Handler and William Arkin, defense analyst for the Institutefor Policy Studies, a liberal, Washington-based research center,said they had discovered from the Ticonderoga's logs that theaccident occurred in international waters about 80 miles from theclosest point of the Okinawa island chain and only 200 miles or soeast of the heavily populated island of Okinawa.   At the time of the accident, Okinawa was under U.S. control. Itwas returned to Japan in 1972.   The Navy said in 1981 that the jet ``rolled off the elevator ofa U.S. aircraft carrier and fell into the sea'' and that the pilot,plane and bomb were all lost.   Arkin said Monday there was little danger of detonation from theone-megaton bomb, which has a force of 1 million tons of TNT. Butthe 15 kilograms of plutonium in the bomb, he added, could threatenthe environment as it deteriorates.   The A-4 was the Navy's main deep-strike aircraft at the time,and an undisclosed number on each U.S. carrier would always beequipped with B-43 hydrogen bombs, Arkin said.   The Navy on Monday maintained its policy of not commenting onwhether its ships carry nuclear weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
