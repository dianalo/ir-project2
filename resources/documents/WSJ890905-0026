Stemming the bullish sentiment about the currency are new evidence of slowing economic growth and the resulting expectations of an easing in Canada's relatively high interest rates. Adding to the worries is the nation's deteriorating trade picture.    &quot;The Canadian dollar is vulnerable here. I'm looking for downward pressure. We may have seen the Canadian dollar's highs for the year,&quot; says Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.    But the Canadian dollar probably won't go into a free fall, as Canada's interest rates should remain lofty enough to buttress the currency and the Bank of Canada probably would intervene against any massive selling spree, traders say.    Before running into problems, the Canadian dollar, which had been climbing since the beginning of the year, edged above 85 U.S. cents last month and hit its highest levels in about nine years.    In late New York trading Friday, it was quoted at 84.65 cents, well below its high but still about 1% above its level at the beginning of 1989. September Canadian dollar futures on the International Monetary Market settled at US$0.8451 Friday, compared with a life-of-contract high of $0.8530 reached last Tuesday.    Ms. Finstrom sees the Canadian dollar dropping to around 84 cents by the end of September. By year's end, she sees the currency at 82.50 cents; a number of more bearish analysts expect the Canadian dollar to be close to 80 cents by December.    While market participants may disagree about the speed of the anticipated descent, currency analysts say there is little doubt that the outlook for Canada's interest rates is the dollar's biggest problem.    The Bank of Canada is expected to ease credit in coming months because of Canada's moderating economic growth, and a &quot;gradual, fairly steady decline&quot; of the Canadian dollar probably will coincide with that development, says Mark Meagher, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc. in Toronto.    Interest rates can have a major influence on a nation's currency because they help determine demand for investments denominated in the unit.    Concerns about lower rates intensified after Thursday's release of Canada's second-quarter gross domestic product data, currency analysts say.    GDP grew at a 0.8% annual rate in the quarter, the slowest inflation-adjusted growth rate since the fourth quarter of 1986, because of slower growth in output, employment, housing starts and housing resales.    With growth likely to remain slow because of weakness in consumer demand and exports, the Bank of Canada may have room to loosen credit after tightening in recent months to battle inflation, says John Grant, chief economist at Wood Gundy Corp. in Toronto.    The closely watched differential between yields on three-month Canadian Treasury bills and three-month U.S. T-bills probably will shrink in the next few months to about 300 basis points, or three percentage points, Mr. Grant says.    The differential is currently 405 basis points, narrowed from 419 in early August but still far wider than the spread of 259 basis points seen in mid-January.    The Bank of Canada is expected to use a rate strategy similar to the U.S. Federal Reserve's, in which any easing will be gradual to avoid rekindling inflation, including price pressures that would be caused by a Canadian dollar plunge. Canada's consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 5.4% in June and July.    Rate concerns are compounded by Canada's trade problems. In the second quarter, its trade surplus narrowed to 719 million Canadian dollars (US$608 million), the smallest quarterly surplus in more than 10 years. Analysts attributed some of the narrowing to the strength of the Canadian currency during the quarter, but a surge in Canadian investment spending also was cited.    Ms. Finstrom of Shearson Lehman Hutton says, &quot;I expect the trade situation to deteriorate as long as the currency is where it is,&quot; and many say the weakening that's expected in the Canadian dollar might not be substantial enough to brighten the trade picture.    They point out that the currency's decline is likely to be curbed by Bank of Canada action and say the Canadian dollar might be seen as a good buy again if the U.S. dollar's recent climb runs out of steam.    &quot;The Canadian dollar's weakness is going to be limited,&quot; says Anthony Franz, a senior foreign exchange account executive at the Canadian Bank of Commerce Trust Co.    The Bank of Canada, he says, is probably content with the Canadian dollar holding around the current level at this time.    Meanwhile, for the U.S. dollar, traders say further gains are likely after its surge last week. Late Friday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.9810 West German marks and 145.98 yen, up from 1.9668 marks and 145.00 yen late Thursday, despite reports that the Bank of Japan sold an estimated $1 billion in Tokyo trading.    In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar opened at 145.85 yen, down from Monday's close of 146.13 yen.    The dollar is poised for a test of important resistance at 2.00 marks after news of the unexpectedly strong U.S. employment performance in August, many traders say.    The jobless rate remained unchanged at 5.2%, and non-farm payrolls grew by 110,000 even though strikes idled about 108,000 workers. Many analysts had expected a 5.3% unemployment rate for August and a non-farm payrolls rise of about 70,000 after the strike impact was accounted for.    &quot;Our economy is showing good growth and moderating inflation. That's good for the greenback,&quot; said Gary Thayer, a currency analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. It is likely that the dollar will try to top 2.05 marks, its 1989 peak so far, in the next few weeks, he says.    In trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $359.35 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
