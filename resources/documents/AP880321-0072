Takeshita's speech was his first at the nation's only defensecollege since he became prime minister last November.   Takeshita said Japan would use its military only for defensivepurposes and would never threaten other nations.   He said Japan's defense buildup would be attained within theframework of the Japan-U.S. security treaty, while adhering toJapan's three non-nuclear policies. Japan bans the manufacture,possession and introduction of nuclear arms into Japan.   The United States has been pressuring Japan to increase defensespending and take more responsibility for its defense. But someAsian nations, which suffered from Japanese aggression during WorldWar II, have expressed concern about a Japanese military build-up.   Takeshita said Japan's security ``will not be guaranteed by itsmilitary power alone'' and called for a comprehensive approach tosecurity, including diplomatic efforts and efforts to maintain acontinuous supply of natural resources from abroad, academyspokesman Nobuo Tsuchida quoted Takeshita as saying.   Last year, Japan formally scrapped a decade-old ceiling whichlimited defense spending to 1 percent of its gross nationalproduct. During the current 1986-90 defense buildup plan, thegovernment says Japan's defense spending will total $119.87 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
