But most of thousands of Irish aliens in the Bostonarea she never sees.   From her small office at St. Augustine's rectory in SouthBoston, Tracey helps illegal aliens apply for the federal amnestyprogram that ends May 4. The overwhelming majority of the area'slarge illegal Irish population won't bother coming.   ``Most of the Irish, unfortunately, are not eligible for theamnesty,'' Tracey said. ``The Irish are not as helped by this asare other ethnic groups.''   Estimates on the number of illegal Irish range from 8,000 to25,000 in Boston, a city of 550,000. Most immigration officials andleaders of the Irish community agree that only 2 percent to 3percent of the Irish qualify for amnesty, which is available toillegal aliens who entered the United States before Jan. 1, 1982.   ``The Irish have come and gone,'' said Charles T. Cobb, districtdirector of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. ``They workeight or nine months and then go home for a while. They never havethe continuity of illegality that is required to qualify under thisprogram.'' Most illegal Irish are employed in the construction andhotel-restaurant industries, he said.   An informal network exists among the Irish who have jobs, andthey help others who come, immigration officials say. Rarely aresuch rings broken up.   In March, a Hingham nursing home owner was indicted forallegedly inducing 11 Irish nationals, through ads in a Dublinnewspaper, to enter the United States illegally and work for him asnursing aides and orderlies.   Of the more than 7,100 aliens who had applied for amnesty inMassachusetts as of April 16, only 101 listed Ireland as theirhomeland. Some 30 others said they were from the United Kingdom,which could include residents of British-controlled NorthernIreland. Nationwide, about 600 Irish aliens have applied out ofabout 1.5 million applicants.   ``The low numbers surprise me to some degree,'' said Cobb. ``Igather that most of the Irish have come here after 1982.''   Bill O'Donnell, editor of the Irish Echo, said his newspaper hadpublished scores of articles in the last year explaining theamnesty provisions and listing the groups offering assistance toprospective applicants. Last week, the newspaper carried aneditorial demanding that Congress extend the deadline.   ``There just simply has not been enough time on the educationalend of it to get the word out,'' O'Donnell said.   Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., has proposed another amnestyprogram for an estimated 150,000 illegal Irish immigrants who don'tqualify for the INS program. Prospects for that proposal, as wellas efforts to extend the deadline, are dim.   Tracey, a social worker for Catholic Charities, meets withprospective applicants at least four days a week, explaining theguidelines and helping with the documentation needed to proveresidency in the United States prior to 1982. She says that whilethe percentage still is small, there has been an increase inapplications since the first of the year.   Cobb concurs.   ``The procrastinators are coming out of the woodwork,'' he said.``It's just like the 14th of April,'' the day before the federalincome tax deadline.   Brendan Scannell, the Irish consul general in Boston, says thatthe Irish who are eligible for amnesty and do not apply will haveno excuse.   ``We Irish are English-speaking, so we are not placed in thesame degree of difficulty about entitlement and awareness of thepackage that INS is offering as are other nationalities,'' Scannellsaid.   ``By now, everyone should know. But you always have people whofor a variety of reasons are reluctant to come forward.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 24</NOTE></DOC>
