 Ask anytrue-blue IBM-oriented developer and they will only have time for Token Ringnetworks.andP;  Ask another and they might well swear by Ethernet and at TokenRing.andP;  The topic is, as they say, an emotive one.andM;Ask each exactly why they prefer one protocol to the other and the repliesare usually the same: from the Token-Ring supporter it's that Ethernet grindsto a halt with only a couple of stations as load.andP;  Ask the Ethernet camp andhigh transmission speeds and long-distance transport are fired right back.andM;But surely there's a little more to it than that?andP;  There is.andP;  I'll describethe two respective protocols to a degree that will illustrate what's goingon, and, I hope, with no bias to either.andM;Both standards are defined in specifications laid down by the Institute ofElectrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE).andP;  Its 802 range of standards covervarious types of networking systems, normally to the lowest two levels of thepredominant International Standards Organization (ISO) Open Systems Interface(OSI) model.andP;  The 802 standard is a seven-layered model covering all aspectsof a network from cable to application.andM;Both the Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) standard and the Token Ring (IEEE 802.5)standards were sponsored by commercial concerns during their development --Ethernet by Xerox, which was then a consortium and Token Ring by IBM.andP;  Theoriginal 802.3 specification was published in 1983, the Token Ringspecification in 1985.andP;  In the PC market, a heavy campaign by IBM renderedToken Ring systems as almost the only viable alternative.andP;  The Ethernetsystem certainly still has considerable life left in it, as borne out by newproducts from its main proponent, 3-Com.andM;EthernetandM;Within the IEEE 802 range of network standards, Ethernet (the 802.3 standard)is the most widely deployed and supported.andP;  It's not, as much of the hypeconcerning IBM's Token Ring suggests, dead; indeed, it will probably continueas one of the major players for some years to come.andM;To clear up one common misconception, the name 'Ethernet' isn't mentionedwithin the 802.3 specification.andP;  Instead, it's trademarked by Xerox, whocarried out much of the development of this type of network.andM;There are two Ethernet specifications: Ethernet I and II.andP;  Ethernet I is theoriginal and isn't compatible with the 802.3 or Ethernet II specification.andO;Ethernet II is the definition that became the IEEE 802.3 standard.andP;  As aresult of this, either 'Ethernet's or 802.3 are commonly used when referringto a network that conforms to the 802.3 CSMA/CD standard.andM;The 802.3 standard uses an access method known as CSMA/CD (Collision Sense,Multiple Access/Collision Detection).andP;  This is a system that allows two ormore stations to share a single, common transmission medium.andP;  This is asingle length of cable, normally co-axial, terminated at each end and intowhich stations can tap using T-junction connectors.andM;In operation, a transmitting station tests the medium to check if any otherstation is currently transmitting data.andP;  If the net is free the transmissionwill take place, the data being sent in a bit serial form.andP;  If the mediumisn't free, the transmitting station will wait, then attempt to transmitagain.andM;If two or more stations are sending messages at the same time, a collisionoccurs.andP;  If this happens, it's detected by each of the offending transmittingstations which then send a few additional bytes to make it clear to otherstations that this has happened.andP;  The original message transmission is thenaborted.andM;After such a collision the affected stations back off for a pause, whichentails remaining quiet for a random length of time before attempting totransmit again.andP;  This random pause ensures that, after one collision, thestations involved don't suffer repeat collisions.andM;The 802.3 standard can be split into two sections that are analogous to thePhysical and Data Link layers of the ISO/OSI model.andP;  The top-most layerwithin the 802.3 model, the Data Link layer, consists of two sublayers: theLogical Link control (LLC) and the Media Access Control (MAC).andP;  Within thelowest layer, the Physical layer, are another two sublayers: the MediumDependent Interface (MDI) and the Attachment Unit Interface (AUI).andP;  Althoughthe Data Link layer is capable of supporting a range of transmission media,for compatibility -- which is, after all the issue -- all stations must stickto the physical media signals defined in the Physical layer, as well as thecorrect communications procedures.andM;The range of media types that could be supported ranges in data rate from1Mbit per second (Mbps) up to 20Mbps.andP;  However, a rate of 10Mbps has beenadopted for the baseband implementation, using a 50 ohm co-axial (trunk)cable.andP;  This trunk cable is often at a fair distance from the stations andso, although most of the hardware is located within the station, a devicecalled a transceiver exists in the form of a small circuit within the MAU.andM;Each layer of the model communicates using an interface.andP;  In this case, it'sbetween the MAC and the Physical layer.andP;  This interface will providefacilities for signals concerning framing (carrier sensing and transmissioninitiation), contention resolution (the detection of collisions), a timingfunction used during pauses, and the actual bit streams for transmission andreception.andM;Between the MAC and LLC sub-layers there also exists an interface for thetransmission and reception of frames as well as status information, whichwould be used by a higher-level layer to provide both error management andrecovery.andM;There are, in addition to these basic interlayer interfaces, a number ofothers concerned with high-level management, but these don't concern us forthe moment.andP;  They're specified within subsections of the 802.3 standard andare dependent upon network usage.andM;Frame structureandM;In many forms of digital communications the data is transmitted in a highlystructured form.andP;  This is no different within the 802 range of standards --the only difference being that within IEEE conventions, these structuredforms are known as frames.andM;The frame for the 802.3 standard contains eight fields, the contents of whichare represented within octets -- similar to a byte, with eight contiguousbits.andP;  Each of the fields have set lengths, the two exceptions being the datafield and the padding field (LLC and PAD respectively).andP;  The reason forpadding out a field is that a frame must be greater than the minimum of 64octets (and less than the maximum of 1518 octets).andM;The eight fields are as follows:andM;1.andP;  Preamble -- this is seven octets in length and allows the physicalsignalling circuitry to reach a steady state ready to correctly clock thefollowing bits.andM;2.andP;  Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) -- one octet containing a fixed pattern thatindicates the start of a frame.andM;3, 4.andP;  Address fields -- there are two address fields; source anddestination.andP;  The address field format can be either 16 or 48 bits.andM;5.andP;  Length -- a two-octet field indicating the number length of datafollowing.andM;6.andP;  Data -- the actual data.andM;7.andP;  PAD -- optional padding to make up the required 64-octet minimum framesize.andM;8.andP;  Frame Check Sequence -- four-octet cyclic redundancy check that iscalculated at source and checked at the destination to ensure no datacorruption has occurred.andM;From this brief description of the contents of a frame, it should be clearthat there is flexibility, primarily within the address fields which can beeither 16 or 48 bits long.andP;  Manufacturers are free to use whichever one theywant or, indeed, support both.andM;Developers can also link this frame structure to higher level protocols (asdoes DEC); these higher level protocols could include TCP/IP, X.25 and XNS.andM;Flexibility within the transmission medium also goes on to provide a furtherrange of implementation possibilities.andP;  For instance I've been discussingbaseband Ethernet up until now -- that is the digital signals are sent 'asis' -- there's no modulation.andP;  Enter broadband Ethernet.andP;  This wasstandardized in 1985 and provides Ethernet services using establishedtelevision-style technology (and frequencies).andP;  In effect, with a broadbandsystem several channels can be transmitted along a single (high-bandwidth)cable.andM;These require a total bandwidth of 36MHz -- with three forward and threereverse channels.andP;  The total capacity of a broadband transmission line mightbe 300 to 400MHz, but even so, trying to squeeze an extra 36MHz out hasalready led some manufacturers to adopt their own in-house standard taking upbetween 12 and 24MHz.andP;  Although the promise is for bigger and better Ethernetinstallations, it seems that people already want more.andM;Token RingandM;A Token Ring setup uses an endless network cabling system as its backbone --a ring.andP;  Stations can be connected into this -- the ring is broken at aconnection point, the station is added and so the ring is complete again.andO;The reason the ring remains unbroken is that all the network traffic passesthrough each station's Token Ring card.andM;If there's information directed to a particular station then as the framepasses through the card, it'll be picked out.andP;  If it isn't destined for thatstation the card will simply retransmit the whole unchanged.andM;In effect, the data is transferred, serially, from one station to the next.andO;This is unlike a CSMA/CD system in which every station receives the data as ageneral broadcast.andM;When IBM introduced its Token Ring implementation, it decided to use amulti-station access unit (MSAU) as the hub.andP;  This MSAU is the ring.andP;  It canaccept up to eight stations and can be chained into other MSAUs to increasethe size of the ring.andM;There are relays within the MSAU that ensure that the ring is alwayscomplete; if a station breaks down or disconnects, the relevant node's relaysnaps shut and the exteral connector is effectively short-circuited -- onceagain the ring is complete.andM;The Token Ring system, as its name implies, relies on the use of a token --just one -- which continuously races around the ring.andP;  If a station wants totransmit it must wait until the token gets around to it, it then checks thestate of the token and if it's 'free' changes it to 'busy' and retransmitsthe token, immediately followed by its message frame.andP;  As the token andmessage frames traverse the ring, they will pass through the designatedreceiver's card.andP;  The receiver copies the message, but can't clear the frame;this is done by the sender when the token and message eventually go completecircle and get back to it.andM;To ensure that no single station has control of the ring for too long aperiod, a token holding timer ensures that the token is only 'swallowed' bythe offending board for a certain time.andM;So there are two types of frames circulating, the token-structure and thetransmitted message frame.andP;  The token's structure is very simple -- a merethree octets in length: a starting delimiter, access control and an endingdelimiter.andM;The access control octet contains information regarding which stations areallowed to use the token -- depending on priority.andP;  On occasions there canalso be a third type of frame, the abort sequence.andM;This is composed of two fields, the starting delimiter and ending delimiter(exactly as in the token and message frames).andP;  If at any point a stationdecides to abort a transmission it can send this abort sequence -- networkcards are designed to recognize such a sequence anywhere within a bit stream-- and act on it accordingly.andM;The message frame contains nine fields:andM;1.andP;  Starting Delimiter -- one octet, a unique starting sequence.andP;  Uniquenessis achieved by violating the normal Manchester encoding method by insertingbits that have caused no transitions.andM;2.andP;  Access Control -- one octet, information regarding the priority of theframe, and so the priority required to take control.andM;3.andP;  Frame Control -- one octet, specifies the source of the frame; either theMAC or LLC sublayers.andM;4.andP;  Destination Address -- two or six octets.andM;5.andP;  Source Address -- two or six octets.andM;6.andP;  Information -- variable length of information.andP;  The length of this fieldcan be within the range of 4 to 65,535 bytes.andP;  Within the field (known as avector) are pairs of two-octet fields providing identifying and lengthinformation for information content.andP;  So, even if there's no informationthese four octets must be present.andM;7.andP;  Frame Check Sequence -- four octets containing a cyclic redundancy checkof the contents.andM;8.andP;  Ending Delimiter -- one octet, similar to the starting delimiter inmake-up.andM;9.andP;  Frame Status -- one octet containing result codes appended during theframe's travels around the ring.andM;One of the main low-level differences between the 802.5 standard and the802.3 is that the serial data is transmitted as most-significant bit first asopposed to least-significant bit first, which happens in the case of the802.3 and indeed most of the mini and micro architectures.andM;802.5 modelandM;Within the 802.5 model there are two layers, each with sub-layers.andP;  These areidentical to those in the 802.3 model in which the LCC sublayer supports datalink functions and provides services to and from the network layer (the nexthighest in the OSI model).andP;  The MAC sublayer controls access to the ringitself, while the physical layer detects and generates the signals over themedium.andP;  The signals travel around the ring at a rate of 4Mbps, although anew, high-speed standard has recently been introduced which providestransmission rates of 16Mbps.andM;In implementation, the wiring is normally twisted-pair.andP;  In fact, it's thewiring between the station and the ring's trunk cable that is recommended tobe twisted-pair, the actual trunk cable could quite happily be co-axial,optic-fibre, or twisted-pair.andM;The IBM Token Ring isn't the only system around, although in the PC marketit's the most prevalent.andP;  ANSI is working on a 100Mbps fibre-optic design andvarious large development companies, such as DEC, have discussed plans forsimilar high-speed networks.andM;ConclusionsandM;An interesting point is that, during development of the 802.3 Ethernetstandard, the inter-operation of equipment from various manufacturers wasplaced high on the list of concerns.andM;This was due to the way the 802.3 specification was sponsored -- by aconsortium of manufacturers.andP;  The Token Ring 802.5 standard was sponsoredprimarily by IBM.andM;As an aside, IBM originally supported its Token Ring standard instead of the802.3 specification, but in 1986 released a minicomputer -- the 9370 -- whichsupported both Ethernet and Token Ring.andM;So which of the two standards is the better?andP;  It is, of course, completelyunfair to ask this sort of question.andP;  Although within laboratory conditionsit's perfectly possible to show that the performance of one is superior tothat of the other.andP;  In a more realistic setting, however, the performance ofthe server's hard disk and processor will be most noticeable in effect.andM;Indeed, the way in which the LAN will be used will determine the performance.andO;The performance of the bus-structured Ethernet specification makes it almostcompletely independent of the number of workstations attached, whereas aToken Ring system can suffer simply by adding more stations (since eachstation has to receive then retransmit the frames a delay is incurred).andM;This argument holds true as long as all the stations are doing nothing.andP;  Theconverse is true when more and more stations become active: a Token Ringsystem's performance will stay approximately the same regardless of thenumber of stations active, while an Ethernet system's performance willdegrade as the numbers of concurrent users increases.andM;And the question of distance spanned?andP;  Well, both are measured by the outputpower of the network card.andP;  However, in a Token Ring system the relevantdistance is from one node to the next -- which is the greatest distance thata frame would have to travel before being boosted.andM;With an Ethernet system, one cable covers all nodes.andP;  So, a Token Ring canhave station up to around 300 metres from the MSAU, and an Ethernet systemcan have a trunk cable spanning up to 500 metres.andM;For a small installation, with users carrying out network-intensive tasks,the Token Ring will perform better than an Ethernet.andP;  The point, though, isthat almost any LAN technology will perform satisfactorily for mostapplications.andP;  Sorry, but neither wins outright.andM;ContactsandM;IBM for Token Ring specifications, network card and driver software on (01)928 1777.andM;3-Com provides a range of Ethernet cards, drivers and information on (0628)890670.andM;Xerox's main research laboratory provided us with the Ethernet standard andthe XNS (Xerox Networking System) file transfer system.andP;
