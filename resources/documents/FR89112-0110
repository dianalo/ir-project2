Type of Application Requested </ITAG>This announcement seeks applications for projects to develop and conducta program of research relating relating to predicting long-term costs andincome for the Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), Disability Insurance(DI), and Health Insurance (HI) Trust Funds. The Boards of Trustees, whichinclude the Secretaries of the Departments of Health and Human Services,Labor, and Treasury and two public trustees, annually agree on economic,demographic, and other assumptions to forecast the size of the OASI, DI,and HI trust funds. The assumptions chosen and methodologies developed are often used by privateinsurance firms, Federal, State and local governments, and private researchersfor a variety of purposes. Successful applicants must be willing to participate in an ASPE-sponsoredconference in Washington, DC, to be held in the spring of 1990. The conferencewill serve as a forum for discussion of important issues related to trustfund forecasts, and will enable researchers to share their results withothers. The following paragraphs describe the general area of interest in greaterdetail by enumerating high priority areas of research. The questions theycontain are intended as illustrations of specific concerns. Applicationsshould be for projects that address one or more of the priority areas discussedbelow; other, closely-related issues may also be included if they are shownto be relevant to the general areas of interest. A. The high priority research areas for which applications for the proposedprogram of research are most desired are as follows: 1. <T3>Productivity and real wage growth. </T3>Explaning the decline in Americanproductivity and forecasting future rates of productivity and wage growthare economic issues with major implications for trust fund forecasts. Thereare several issues that should be addressed. (a) Increased integration of the U.S. economy into world markets has hadan important short-run impact, and may affect long-term productivity growth.(b) One unresolved issue involves the choice of part time-periods as abasis for forecasts of productivity and real wage growth. (c) New forecasts of immigration and of human and physical capital growthmay imply different forecasts of productivity growth. (d) Other explanations for the productivity slowdown, including ``statisticalmyopia'' may be worth exploring. 2. <T3>Immigration. </T3>Important changes in immigration law with the passageof the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and in the global politicaland economic environment may imply dramatic changes in the pattern of immigration.It may be useful to incorporate these changes formally in projecting thenumber and employment characteristics of immigrants. Furthermore, immigrationwill affect overall fertility rates, earnings, and other aspects of thetrust fund forecast. New data may permit the examination of these and relatedissues, such as the relationship between illegal immigration and benefitpayments. 3. <T3>Uncertainty, confidence intervals, and long-term forecasts. </T3>Questionsin this area include: (a) Is there greater uncertainty in the projection of some variables thanothers? How important are these variables to the accuracy of the trustfund projections?(b) Do the policy consequences differ depending on whether the system isin surplus or deficit and the size of the projected imbalance? Would moreformal means (e.g. a loss-function approach) be helpful in taking intoaccount possible asymmetric costs of projection errors?(c) Should formal means be used to incorporate the greater uncertaintyof distant-year forecasts compared with the forecast for years in the not-so-distantfuture? How could confidence intervals be established for the projections?Is the current practice of using 75 years as the long-term projection reasonable?4. <T3>The future labor force</T3>_(a) <T3>Women in the labor force.</T3> The earnings and labor force participationof women, given the dramatic changes in the past twenty years, is an areawhere forecasts could be improved with better knowledge of current behavior.In particular, improved projections of women's <T3>lifetime</T3> labor force participation patterns and the male/femaleearnings differential would be useful in forecasting revenues, the numberand types of beneficiaries, as well as the level of benefits. The effectsof reduced fertility and increased divorce rates are important considerationsin modeling and predicting women's earnings and labor force participationrates. For example, actual or anticipated divorce may increase labor forceparticipation; increased labor market experience in turn could lead tohigher wage rates as well as increased lifetime earnings.(b)<T3> Older workers.</T3> The current pattern of substantial pre-age 65retirement may be dramatically influenced by changes in the demographicand economic environment, and by shifting government and employer policies.Do participation-rate forecasts accurately reflect current expectationsin these areas?Other areas, including fertility and mortality assumptions, the rate ofinflation, interest rates, and the rate of return on capital, divisionof compensation between money wages and fringe benefits, and the internalconsistency of assumptions could be candidates for supported research.However, preference will be given to well-designed research in the highpriority areas.Details about the assumptions, methods, and acturial estimates are containedin Actuarial Studies published by the Office of the Actuary, Social SecurityAdministration, and are available upon request from that office. Interestedparties can request the latest actuarial studies on economic and demographicprojections, e.g., <T3>OASDI Long-Range Beneficiary Projection: 1987 </T3>(Actuarial StudyNo. 100), <T3>Economic Projections for OASDIHI Cost and Income Estimates: 1987</T3>(Actuarial Study No. 101), <T3>Social Security Area Population Projections: 1988</T3> (Actuarial StudyNo. 102). Write to: Office of Actuary, Social Security Administration,Room 700, Altmeyer Bldg., Baltimore, Maryland 21235. phone: (301)-965-30151. ProductsThe applicant should present a schedule for delivery of interim progressreports and a final report. It is expected that the final report will include:(1) Analysis of past trends for the variable; (2) well-developed explanationsof the historical experience; (3) empirical tests of these explanations;and (4) forecasts of future trends based on the analysis.2. Potential UsersThe research is expected to be useful to the Trustees in choosing the assumptionsand/or to the actuaries in refining the methodologies used to make theirpredictions. Professionals in actuarial science, demography, economics,sociology, and related fields are potential users of the results. Becausemany of those who will be interested in this research lack advanced technicaltraining, it is important that the results of projects be presented ina fashion accessible to such an audience. This will involve the submissionof a separate, non-technical executive summary.3. Types of Projects ExcludedBecause of the nature of the work, projects from local service deliveryorganizations will not be funded.4. Content and Organization of the ApplicationsThe application must begin with a cover sheet followed by the requiredapplication forms and an abstract (of not more than two pages) of the application.Failure to include the abstract may result in delays in processing theapplication. Each application should include a discussion of the relevantliterature, a statement of the issue(s) being examined, the probable directionthe research will take, a discussion of some of the likely hypotheses tobe tested, and a discussion of possible data sources to test the hypotheses.Resumes of staff should be included, as should a full budget and a scheduleof tasks for the proposed projects.<ITAG tagnum="84">B.
