Meanwhile, India lacks an elected government, is runningperilously low on foreign-exchange reserves and has severaldebt payments coming due. Even the International MonetaryFund won't discuss more loans right now. Still, Indianofficials are trying to convince foreign governments thattheir country is a safe bet and that the current politicalflux is just part of the democratic process.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the Indianeconomy except the short-term problem with the balance ofpayments,&quot; says Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha. Hesaid he hopes friendly governments will be willing to lendIndia the money it needs, and says: &quot;It would be wrong toassume that the assertion of the democratic process isinstability.&quot;   The friendliest governments probably will be Japan, theU.S. and Britain. In Tokyo a few weeks ago, Mr. Sinha got apositive reception from Japanese officials, but no firmcommitments. And in Hong Kong, foreign bankers who met withMr. Sinha said they are curious about India's potential, butwon't consider lending until the IMF and governments set newloans.   For the IMF, the most important issue is India's comingparliamentary election. Since the government of PrimeMinister Chandra Shekhar resigned in early March, therehasn't been anyone in New Delhi empowered to consider new IMFconditions for fresh funding. Mr. Sinha is part of acaretaker government in place until the mid-May election.   Political crises have hobbled the country for nearly twoyears, preventing implementation of policies that would makethe country's insular economy more attractive to lenders. Andwhile many bankers, businessmen and officials atmultinational organizations believe that India has tremendouspotential, they also fear that unless the new governmenttakes some politically unsavory steps to free the economy,India will keep limping from crisis to crisis.   Indian politics have become increasingly fractured, withthe country's many small parties exacerbating religious andethnic strife, which in turn has slowed economic progress andfocused the world's attention on the country's problemsrather than its successes. Says a businessman from New Delhi,&quot;The only situation that can turn things around is that astable government is elected.&quot;   Since elections were last held in late 1989, India hasbeen ruled by two coalition governments, neither of which hadenough power to rule effectively. That meant that even beforethe most recent government collapsed in early March, thefragile economy had begun to show cracks.   India's foreign-exchange reserves dwindled to just $750million at one point during the first quarter of 1991. Andthough harsh import restrictions have since brought thefigure to more than $2 billion, it still is barely enough tocover imports at normal levels for three weeks. And exportsfell in the first weeks of the austerity move.   The IMF approved an interim loan of $1.79 billion inJanuary, but since Parliament was dissolved in March, therehas been no government able to discuss new terms with theIMF. The newest IMF money could be depleted as soon as lateMay, before the new Parliament can meet in early June.   Several other factors contributed to the decline inIndia's foreign reserves. Foreign investment in the countrydropped more than 50% last year from the 1989 level, and thePersian Gulf war cut remittances from workers in the Mideastand increased the cost of imported oil.   In addition, the global credit crunch has made it moredifficult and more expensive for countries and companies toborrow, particularly lower-rated borrowers such as India.U.S. credit-rating agencies lowered their ratings for Indiain March, the second cut in six months.   &quot;I don't see any commercial banks looking at India,&quot; saysa foreign banker in Hong Kong.   Unless the situation improves, India may have to seek arescheduling for some of its huge foreign debt of $70billion. Annual interest payments alone could soon reach $1billion, and the government is running a large budgetdeficit. But Indian officials want to preserve its ability tomake timely debt payments, which has kept the country in aleague above many debt-ridden Latin American countries. &quot;Weare determined to ensure that the excellent track recordsince our independence in 1947 of not defaulting on any ofour international commitments&quot; is maintained, Mr. Sinha says.   That record is one reason bankers and businessmen believeIndia's fortunes could turn around quickly. Economic growthin the year ended March 31 was an estimated 4%, afterexpanding an annual average of nearly 6% in five previousyears. Growth this year is expected to be flat, but steadyproduction in agriculture and small-scale manufacturingprobably will shore up the economy in the second half ifpolitical problems can be resolved.   &quot;The Indian economy has demonstrated that it can beextremely resilient,&quot; says the foreign banker in Hong Kong.He added that the closed economy is a mixed blessing. &quot;Itprotects them in times of crisis, but it means they can'tgrow out of their problems either,&quot; he says.   And though the Indian economy remains among the mostclosed in the world, liberalization is moving steadilyforward. Still, any new government will have to be strongenough to swallow the bitter medicine necessary to get theeconomy back on track. Many analysts say the only party thatcan achieve that level of strength is Rajiv Gandhi's Congress(I) Party, which has ruled the country for most of the past44 years. Mr. Gandhi lost the political mandate in 1989 amidscandal and widespread disillusionment. He isn't offering anew political agenda. &quot;His only platform is that he can forma stable government,&quot; says an Indian banker.</TEXT></DOC>
