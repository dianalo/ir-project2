Unfortunately, the statistic on which he based hisconclusion is not meaningful as used, and his analysisignores a substantial amount of contrary evidence.   The index of state &quot;relative tax effort&quot; computed by theAdvisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations measuresnot tax levels, but a state's tax collections relative to itspotential tax capacity. &quot;Tax capacity&quot; is an attempt tomeasure what collections would be if that state had a typicalstate tax structure.</LP><TEXT>   Tax levels seem more meaningful for people considering amove. California's &quot;relative tax effort&quot; is below thenational average, even though taxes per person in Californiaare about 10% above the national average. In contrast, taxesper person are nearly $300 lower in Iowa than California, butIowa is categorized as an above-average &quot;tax effort&quot; state.For someone comparing $50,000 jobs in California and Iowabased on taxes, it seems more relevant that taxes for theaverage person are $300 lower in Iowa, even though Iowa hashigher &quot;relative tax effort.&quot;   Differences in state taxes per person do not seem to haveinfluenced state population changes. Of the 10 statesidentified as having the slowest relative population growth,Indiana, Iowa, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and WestVirginia actually collected taxes per person below thenational average in 1988. Alaska, California and Washington,listed as having fast relative population growth, collecthigher taxes per person than average. (Alabama, Arkansas andMississippi are perennially low-tax states, but have notenjoyed substantial relative economic growth.)   The relevant issue is not whether taxes are higher in onestate than another, but whether a government is providing thelevel and type of services desired by its residents. Taxesare payments for services, and tax differences reflectdifferences in demand and cost. The economic principle of &quot;nofree lunch&quot; applies -- people get the services they pay for.And better services -- particularly for education andtransportation -- can attract both capital and individuals.As population and incomes increase, increases in the demandand costs for government services often occur. This requiresstates -- even such low-tax states as Arizona, Florida, NewHampshire and Texas -- to search for new revenues to buildinfrastructure and finance those services.   The realignment of population toward the South and Westcontinues. This trend has been influenced by the changing ageand ethnic composition of the population, by technologicaland infrastructure changes that have reduced the meaning ofdistances, and by a desire for warmer climates andless-crowded areas. Taxes are not the explanation. As long asgovernments provide the services demanded by residents asefficiently as possible, the fiscal differences among thestates reflect what people want and are a desirable featureof our federal fiscal system.

Robert A. Bowman   State Treasurer   State of Michigan   Lansing, Mich.   ---   Mr. Littman referred to California as a low-tax state. Asa California taxpayer, I wonder about that. I pay Californiastate income taxes of 9.3%, one of the highest in the nation.In my county of Santa Clara, I pay additional sales taxes of7.25%, also one of the nation's highest. According to arecent Tax Foundation tax table, in 1988 California had aper-capita state income tax of $454.34. Only 11 other stateshad higher income taxes for that year.   Anyone who thinks of California as a low-tax haven may beliving in a state of delusion.   Jack K. Ayre   Sunnyvale, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
