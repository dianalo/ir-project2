The 8-4 vote was on legislation to allow shooting victims and thefamilies of homicide victims to recover monetary damages from themanufacturer of a gun used in a shooting, regardless of who was atfault. If given final approval, it could be the first such law inthe United States.   Manufacturers around the country generally have not been heldresponsible by the courts for gun damage under existing laws. Thenew legislation could expose them to hundreds of new lawsuits.   Council members said they hope the measure will reduce theavailability of firearms in the district, as well as around thecountry.   ``This is not PR,'' said council member William P. Lightfoot,D-At Large, a proponent of the legislation. ``If you make adangerous weapon, we're going to hold you responsible any time it isused.''   Richard R. Atkinson Jr., a member of the board of directors ofthe National Rifle Association and president of the District ofColumbia Firearms Association, said the council's action could havea negative impact on home rule by giving its federal opponentsadditional ammunition with which to attack the district's localgovernment.   ``I think if the city council continues with this kind ofmeddling in other states' affairs, it will go down in history as thecity council that lost home rule,'' he said.   During the council debate over the legislation Tuesday, opponentsof the handgun bill raised similar concerns.   Council member Betty Ann Kane, who voted against the bill, calledit a ``knee-jerk'' response to the violence on the street. She saidshe doesn't understand ``why we are taking away individualresponsibility'' for the commission of shooting crimes.</TEXT></DOC>
