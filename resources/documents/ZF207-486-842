 Theyare supposed to require years of expertise in optics, thousands of hours offiber installation experience and many months of training.andP;  Not so for 10NetPlus for Fiber Optic.andP;  This fiber optic network installs in minutes.andP;  Infact, with preconnectorized fiber optic cable, we installed a four-node 10NetPlus for Fiber Optic network in less time than it took us to install 10Net'stwisted pair network, which is itself extremely easy to install.andM;10Net Plus for Fiber Optic uses a hub and spoke architecture, yet the accessmethod is Ethernet.andP;  That is, it still uses a Carrier Sense Multiple Accesswith Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol for network access.andP;  Each port onthe eight-port hub acts as a repeater, regenerating signals out to the otherports.andP;  Right now there is no standard for putting Ethernet on fiber opticcable, though it is in the works by the IEEE 802.3 10BASE-F committee.andP;  Thereis a 10BASE-F standard called the Fiber Optic Inter Repeater Link (FOIRL)standard, but 10Net does not conform to this standard.andP;  10Net fiber opticwill interoperate with any other Ethernet network on any other medium as soonas their fiber optic repeater is shipped in the third quarter of 1989.andM;10Net Plus for Fiber Optic requires three basic components: a fiber opticinterface card, a fiber optic hub and network operating system software.andP;  The10Net fiber optic interface card uses a standard 82586 Ethernet Controllerfrom Intel.andP;  It has 64K bytes of dual ported RAM for buffering and datatransfers to PC memory.andP;  It has one fiber optic transmitter and one fiberoptic receiver, both using SMA type 905 connectors.andP;  ST connectors (the typeATandamp;T uses) may be ordered from 10Net.andP;  The transmit and receive jacks on theboard are given different colors for easy identification.andP;  Three differentsizes of fiber -- 50, 62.5 and 100 microns -- are supported.andP;  A small, redLED at the back of the board indicates data transmission so users know theinterface card is working.andM;The 10Net fiber optic hub has eight ports, each with a fiber optictransmitter and a fiber optic receiver.andP;  These also use SMA type 905connectors, though ST type connectors may be ordered.andP;  Ports may connect toother hubs or to a PC.andP;  Up to three levels of hubs are permitted, allowingnetworks of up to 392 nodes without repeaters.andP;  The hub handles the samesizes of cable as the interface board.andP;  Finally, the hub is active, meaningit requires power.andM;10Net Plus software is the newest version of 10Net, shipped last year.andP;  Ituses NetBIOS and runs over many different media, including Token Ring,Ethernet, 10Net's twisted pair boards and, of course, 10Net's fiber opticboards.andP;  It allows any workstation to be a server, sharing any or all of itsresources.andP;  Network configuration and management is easy.andP;  Security isextensive.andP;  Diagnostics are terrific, making fault isolation fast.andP;  We haveused 10Net at LAN Magazine in various capacities and are quite happy with itas the basis for an editorial network.andM;Installing 10Net FiberandM;OpticandM;Installing 10Net Fiber Optic hardware was relatively easy.andP;  The mostdifficult part was keeping track of the cable.andP;  Two steps were involved:putting the interface cards in the PCs and connecting cards and hub withfiber optic cable.andM;10Net Fiber Optic uses multi-mode fiber, as opposed to single mode fiber.andP;  Ingeneral, multi-mode fiber is less expensive, has a larger aperture, andcarries light less far.andP;  Single mode fiber has an aperture of around ninemicrons.andP;  Multi-mode fiber's aperture is 50 or 60 microns and sometimes 100microns.andP;  The larger aperture means the light moves around much more as ittravels down the fiber, &quot;bouncing&quot; off the sides of the fiber.andP;  This reducesthe distance the light can travel.andM;Though there is technology to allow one fiber to carry light in twodirections, this is rarely used.andP;  Instead, two fibers are normally used forany one connection.andP;  Thus, to connect a PC to a fiber optic hub, two cablesare used.andP;  In making the connection, the transmit port of one device isconnected to the receive port of the other device, and vice versa.andP;  10Netmakes this a little easier by color coding the transmit and receive.andP;  One isa light color, the other is dark.andP;  We never did figure out which is which,but it didn't matter as long as we connected the light to the dark.andM;10Net does not provide fiber cable.andP;  We received this from a LAN dealer,already connectorized.andP;  Putting connectors on fiber optic cable is not aneasy task and should be avoided at almost all costs.andP;  If you cannot buypreconnectorized cable, use a professional installer.andP;  You'll actually savemoney.andP;  In either case, make sure the cable is well marked.andP;  The onlypossible mistake that can be made when hooking up devices is connecting twotransmit ports instead of one transmit port and one receive port.andP;  Properlylabelled cable will help avoid this problem.andM;Once all the boards are installed and all the cables are connected (theysimply screw on), the 10Net Fiber Optic hub needs to be plugged in.andP;  That'sall there is to 10Net's hardware installation.andM;Installing 10Net's software is even easier.andP;  Three disks hold the software.andO;An installation program leads users through the entire process of copying thefiles, selecting the proper memory addresses and interrupts, configuring eachworkstation and modifying the CONFIG.SYS file.andP;  Once the installation programis finished, rebooting the PC and typing GO is all that is needed to run10Net.andM;Using 10Net Fiber OpticandM;10Net Fiber Optic runs at 10M bits per second, the standard Ethernet speed.andO;This is a big improvement over the 1M-bits-per-second version we have used inthe past.andP;  In addition to the hardware improvements, several softwareadditions have boosted 10Net's performance, including NetBIOS, updatedtransport software and 10Net's caching program.andM;10Net's traditional ease of use has been maintained in the Fiber Opticversion.andP;  Not only is installation easy, but everyday use is a breeze.andO;Simple commands allow users to make any type of connection they desire.andO;Nothing is written in stone at boot up, other than the fact that aworkstation does or does not have the capacity to share devices.andP;  Evenchanging this is simple.andP;  All it takes is a change of two or three lines inan ASCII file and a reboot.andM;It is possible to make all workstations servers.andP;  This means users can shareany or all of their devices, whenever they want, for as long as they want.andO;Allowing users to share devices mirrors the way people work.andP;  Not allcommunications go through a central device.andP;  Why should people be forced toadd an extra step to their communications by passing everything through acentral file server?andM;In addition, 10Net will allow users to submit jobs to a server.andP;  For example,it is possible to make a server compile a program from a workstation.andP;  TheCHAT facility makes this easy.andP;  Users simply enter CHAT from any application,indicate the name of the server and type in the command.andP;  The server thenexecutes the command.andP;  This is ideal for running batch programs remotely.andO;Only programs run from the DOS prompt may be executed and only when theserver workstation is not being used for something else, though submittedjobs will be queued until the server is free.andP;  There is one drawback to thenew 10Net Fiber Optic.andP;  The diagnostics are not quite as good as the old10Net's.andP;  Because the hardware has been changed, it is more difficult to getthe good information about the card that was possible with the old,twisted-pair cards.andM;Nonetheless, there are tons of diagnostic information available at everyworkstation with the touch of a few keys, from within any application.andP;  Infact, this diagnostic capability is the most overlooked feature of 10Net.andO;The feature is called TALLYS.andP;  There are over 35 TALLYS, each indicatingsomething about the type of traffic being sent to and from a workstation.andO;Using 10Net's CHAT facility, a LAN manager can walk up to any station and getinformation about the interface card and the errors on the network.andP;  In amatter of seconds the LAN manager can see if too many retries are takingplace, possibly indicating a hardware problem, or if there are too manybuffer errors, indicating a need to change the workstation's softwareconfiguration.andM;ConclusionandM;10Net Fiber Optic has all the advantages of other fiber optic networks,without the hassle and cost.andP;  It is immune to electromagnetic interference,difficult to tap, runs very long distances (over two kilometers without arepeater) and is fast.andP;  Yet, it is easy to install, use and maintain.andP;  Plus,its total cost is less than $1,700 per node for hardware and software.andM;Further proof of 10Net Fiber Optic's viability (and the wisdom of thecompany's strategy) is demonstrated by the fact that many governmentagencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Air Force,are installing it.andP;  You know they chose it because it is secure (TEMPESTcompliant) and because it its cost effective.andM;The ultimate testimonial to 10Net's ease of installation, use and maintenanceis the fact that with 10Net, no full-time LAN manager is necessary.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
