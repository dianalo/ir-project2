He scans his cockpit controls for defending enemy planes.    Suddenly, one flashes into sight. The copilot shouts, &quot;4 o'clock high,&quot; and the pilot climbs hard. The mission is in trouble. The foe's jet loops back in hot pursuit, a second fighter plane appears. Words from an enemy pilot squawk over the cockpit radio.    &quot;Darn,&quot; says the invading aircraft's copilot. &quot;They got us.&quot;    It's just another day, another dogfight for Flight International Group Inc., one of the funkier over-the-counter concerns to come over the horizon. The company, the official sparring partner of the Pentagon, uses Soviet military tactics and simulates East bloc electronics to test U.S. military might. Says Douglas G. Matthews, Flight International's chairman: &quot;We're the Rent-a-Russian air force.&quot;    With 65 planes, Flight International has a bigger military air fleet than a lot of countries -- Ireland, Panama and Tunisia, to name a few. It has nine MiG &quot;kills&quot; to its pilots' credit and is second only to Moscow in anti-American electronic-warfare capability. This is an outfit that shouldn't be messed with. Mr. Matthews swears, though, that the West has nothing to fear, likening the firm to basketball's Washington Generals, that perennial opponent of the Harlem Globetrotters. &quot;We're supposed to make the game close,&quot; he says, &quot;but hopefully the Trotters will win.&quot;    Only a decade ago, this kind of business didn't exist. Mr. Matthews was flying for Delta Air Lines then, with a pilot-training school as a sideline. But after a stint in Vietnam, he still yearned for the action of a fighter pilot. And having operated a successful, though illicit, T-shirt business from his Naval Academy dorm, he dreamed of a more daring entrepreneurship. So in 1980, when the not usually frugal Pentagon was considering ways to save some money, he convinced the Navy that it could do certain kinds of training more cheaply by contract.    Today, Flight International dominates its little defense-contracting niche the way McDonald's serves up hamburgers: over 20,000 sorties this year alone. Oh, sure, the company has some tame sidelines -- like flying checks between Federal Reserve Banks -- but when its managers discuss &quot;the customer,&quot; there's no doubt that they are talking about the Defense Department.    Since 75% of Flight International's pilots are former military types, interservice rivalry and a cavalier combat-flier culture abound at the company's Newport News, Va., headquarters. &quot;We look down on anybody who can't land on a carrier,&quot; says David Sharp, a former Navy captain who oversees naval contracts. And the 42-year-old Mr. Matthews, a former Navy lieutenant, holds 122 Learjet speed records.    The Learjet, made by a subsidiary of Integrated Resources Inc., is actually the most essential piece of equipment for the company. Flight International buys used corporate jets -- the Oil Patch is a hot market, these days -- dismantles the executive bar, removes the plush seats, and otherwise strips the once-posh interior. Ground crews then begin adorning the exterior. Under the wing, they place a radio- and radar-jamming pod and a box for dropping &quot;chaff&quot; (shredded aluminum foil that creates false blips on radars). A bulbous antenna is attached to the back of the aircraft, and additional aerials are put on top. &quot;What we do,&quot; says retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Albert G. Rogers, a vice president, &quot;is take a beautiful custom jet and make a pickup truck out of it.&quot;    Flying a jury-rigged Learjet is a lot less expensive than operating a late-model fighter plane, and this enables Flight International to produce war games at about 20% of what it would cost its main customers, the Navy and Air Force. Not to mention that fighter jocks' valuable time is better spent learning how to repel the Bear, as they call their Russian counterparts. Also, the Soviet Union's chances of ever attacking in the guise of corporate jets are greatly diminished.    The Bear might be easy pickings compared with Flight International pilots. They include three veterans of the Navy's precision-flying Blue Angels and the Air Force's Thunderbirds, four former prisoners of war and plenty of 20-year military veterans. Because a fighter pilot's nightmare of retirement is loading luggage on a commuter airline or serving sandwiches aboard a corporate jet, playing the combat opponent is an ideal alternative. As pilot Hugh Garner puts it, &quot;I didn't want to have to fly straight and level.&quot;    There's little danger of that at Flight International, as a maneuver off the New Jersey coast shows. Mr. Garner is playing the &quot;bogey,&quot; as an invader is called, and the state's Air National Guard must try to intercept him. &quot;We have a spook in the area,&quot; says a voice over his radio, signaling the start of the game.    Mr. Garner turns his plane to point the radar- and radio-jamming pod at the defender. He begins flying right toward him, a head-on tactic that can be most deceptive. Larry Ederer, the electronic-warfare operator, fiddles with frequency dials and begins to drop chaff.    Pilot Garner can tell he is giving the good guys fits, as he hears them try to thwart the radio-jamming by saying one word at a time. He zooms closer: 50 miles, 30 miles, then less. Co-pilot Michael Banez squints into the distance, finally spots the other plane and shouts, &quot;3 o'clock high!&quot; It streaks by overhead. &quot;No kill,&quot; Mr. Garner declares. &quot;They couldn't see us until too late.&quot;    But, as with any sparring partner, Flight International often takes it on the chin. Once the fighter planes can eyeball the bogey -- announced with the sporting cry of &quot;Tally ho!&quot; -- they can usually score a kill. The fighter jets are twice as fast as Learjets, and once they have the quarry in the cross hairs of their guns, they announce the kill much like boys doing backyard combat.    Live ammunition is reserved for exercises like naval target-towing missions, wherein Flight International's planes cruise over a ship and let the anti-aircraft gunners blast away at an eight-foot-long cylinder trailing behind. This isn't as dangerous as it sounds; to avert the perils of inaccuracy, the target trails well behind -- about four miles.    It also isn't as easy to hit as it looks. After four passes over a Navy destroyer off Virginia one morning, Flight International crew member Edward Basile reels in the target, which hasn't even been grazed, and announces, &quot;It's a virgin!&quot; (Lest this give comfort to enemies, Mr. Sharp, the company's administrator, says the target is a little too tiny for the kind of anti-aircraft gun being used. Real aircraft, he asserts, would have been blasted to smithereens.)    For at-sea thrills, Flight International's pilots much prefer another exercise, in which they divebomb ships to simulate missiles and see whether radar operators are paying attention. And the company would like to be providing an even higher form of heart-pounding excitement. It is trying to assemble a fleet of used fighter planes for all-out dogfights with U.S. flyboys. First, however, it must convince the Pentagon that it needs this more terrible Ivan. And second, it must procure the equipment, and there aren't a lot of secondhand F-5s around for civilians. Nonetheless, Flight International already has one fighter, late of the Norwegian air force, and the company's chances shouldn't be discounted.    Flight International also has taken off financially, doubling revenue to about $40 million in fiscal 1988 and winning some investor attention. Its stock recently hit a high of $15.50 a share, up from a post-crash low of $6.25. It closed Friday at $14.75, down 25 cents. Chairman Matthews, tongue firmly in cheek, suggests one possible explanation: &quot;There's a rumor of a hostile tender offer by Spain.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
