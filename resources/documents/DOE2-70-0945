Decreasedspheromak open flux led to vastly improved decaying discharges, includingincreased global energy confinement times {tau}{sub E} (from 20 to 180{mu}s) and corresponding magnetic energy decay times {tau}{sub B{sup2}} (from 0.7 to 2 ms). Improved confinement allowed the observationof a pressure-driven instability which ejects plasma from the spheromakinterior to the wall. 9 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
