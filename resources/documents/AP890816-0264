It found that Venezuela has a 94 percent price advantage fornatural gas and 91 percent for fuel oil, Saudi Arabia 83 percent forgas and 72 percent for fuel oil, Indonesia a 50 percent advantagefor gas and none for fuel oil.   In Mexico, production costs are as much as 19.25 percent lowerthan in the United States due to savings from lower priced resources.   The report added that U.S. imports increased because of theseprice advantages.   The report, made at the request of Congress, concentrated oninvestment in the oil industry.   It found wide variation in the effects of other governments'policies on foreigners.   Indonesia, for example, has recently permitted companies to betreated like those locally owned as long as 51 percent of the stockis held by Indonesian nationals. But foreigners are still limited toa minority interest. Until recently, only companies completely ownedby Indonesian citizens were allowed to distribute goods.   Though the Soviet Union is now permitting foreigners to hold amajority of the stock in some joint ventures, they are limited to aminority holding in energy and the major industries that consume it.   The Communist government of China started encouraging foreigninvestors much earlier than the Soviets but still subjects them to along bureaucratic approval process, the report said.   A new law in Mexico this year automatically approves companiesowned by foreigners if the investment is less than $100 million. Butthe foreign share in a telecommunications firm is stil limited to 49percent and needs the approval of the National Foreign InvestmentCommission.   The Mexican government continues to hold exclusive rights toexplore and develop oil and natural gas, and to produce basicpetrochemicals, radioactive material and energy.   Canada insists on 50 percent ownership by its nationals beforeissuing licenses to exploit natural resources in frontier areas.   Saudi Arabia keeps exclusive control of minerals, except for oiland natural gas.   Venezuela controls the domestic oil industry through thestate-owned Petroleos de Venezuela.   Most members of the Organization of Petroleum ExpoprtingCountries (OPEC) control their domestic energy industries.</TEXT></DOC>
