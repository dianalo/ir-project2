Cigarettes are not involved in the action announced Tuesday byVons Cos. Inc. because they already carry a federally mandatedwarning label. Several brands of chewing tobacco that carry suchlabels also are exempt.   ``It's the first time we are aware of that a supermarket hastaken product off the shelves in response to Proposition 65,'' saidDeputy Attorney General Craig C. Thompson, the state enforcementcoordinator for the law created by the November 1986 ballotinitiative.   The law requires the state to identify products and substancesthan can cause cancer, birth defects and sterility. Businesses mustwarn the public of ``significant'' amounts of the substances.   Vons has 336 stores in the central and southern parts ofCalifornia. It recently acquired 172 Safeway supermarkets inSouthern California.   The removal of 17 tobacco products produced by five companieswas designed to comply with Proposition 65, said Vons spokeswomanVickie Sanders.   On Friday, state Attorney General John K. Van de Kamp filed acivil lawsuit against 25 tobacco manufacturers and eight food storechains, including Vons. The suit claimed the companies failed towarn consumers of the cancer risk of certain products.   However, Ms. Sanders told the Los Angeles Times that thedecision to pull the products had nothing to do with the lawsuit.   ``We did not do it without warning or notice to manufacturers.This is not a sudden move on Vons' part,'' she said.   Tobacco manufacturers and distributors were told in August thatVons would require warning labels on products by Sept. 17, Ms.Sanders said. That deadline later was extended until Monday, shesaid.   The tobacco industry hoped it could comply with the law byposting signs in stores and other measures short of attachingwarning labels to their products.   Norman F. Sharp, president of the Cigar Association of Americaand the Pipe Tobacco Council, said in a statement from Washington,D.C.: ``The warning message is, in fact, reaching the mass of cigarand pipe tobacco purchasers throughout the state. We do not thinkthe producers' efforts, which have been timely and responsible, canbe legitimately faulted.''   Mary Hernandez, assistant manager at Von's Westside Pavilionstore, said she finished pulling the cigars and other items fromshelves late Tuesday. So far, no customers had complained, she said.   ``You will see bare shelves. There will be a sign up theretelling customers we apologize for the inconvenience, but it is anecessary inconvenience,'' Ms. Sanders said.   John Shepherd, a spokesman for Safeway Stores Inc., said thechain, which has 221 stores in California, gave manufacturers untilOct. 17 to label products or have shipments refused. Meantime, thestores have posted warning signs near cigar, pipe and chewingtobacco displays.</TEXT></DOC>
