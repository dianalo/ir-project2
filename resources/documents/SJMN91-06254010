In fact, it's partly because ofhim that California doesn't have no-fault auto insurance, a system that wouldreduce substantially the auto insurance premiums most of us pay and wouldshrink the number of uninsured motorists on our roads.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GARAMENDI ACTED TOO LATE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Last year, when Garamendi ran for insurance commissioner, he opposedno-fault auto insurance. And while his endorsement of a plan similar to onestuck in the Senate Judiciary Committee is welcome, it came about a weekbefore the current legislative session ends. That's much too late to have anyeffect this year.;   Since Garamendi spent 16 years in the Legislature, hesurely knew that when he made his announcement in front of Los Angelestelevision cameras.;    EVEN THOUGH it came too late, Garamendi's endorsementof no-fault is useful. The issue is sure to come up in the Legislature nextyear, and if Garamendi doesn't change his mind again, his position will helpthose who favor no-fault.;   More important, Garamendi's announcement helpedfocus attention on the benefits that a good no-fault auto insurance law couldbring to California consumers.;   Such a proposal was written by ConsumersUnion, the not-for-profit publisher of Consumer Reports, and by Sen. PatrickJohnson, D-Stockton. It would already be law if the wishes of the majority ofthe Legislature, and of Gov. Pete Wilson, hadn't been thwarted by HouseSpeaker Willie Brown, D-San Francisco, and Sen. Bill Lockyer, D-Hayward, whohave bottled up the bill in committee.;   In a no-fault insurance system, aninjured party is paid by his or her insurance company without regard to whocaused an accident. It's the way most personal insurance, such as homeowner'sinsurance, works.;   Automobile bodily injury coverage was traditionally basedon the tort liability system, under which the negligent party's insurancecompany pays damages. To receive money under this system, you have to provethat somebody else was negligent, which can be time-consuming and expensive.;   NO-FAULT auto insurance can save money because it reduces the number oflawsuits and discourages exaggerated and fraudulent claims.;   California autoinsurance premiums grew 88 percent from 1982 to 1988. In New York, a strongno-fault state, they grew only 56 percent in the same period.;   There aremany kinds of no-fault laws. Some, like Proposition 104, which was defeated byCalifornia voters in 1988, are bad for consumers. But others, like the oneproposed by Johnston, are good.;   Johnston's bill is modeled on New York'svery successful law. No-fault policyholders would receive up to $15,000 forlost wages and medical bills from their own insurance company, no matter whocaused the accident. Drivers and passengers couldn't sue for pain andsuffering unless their injuries were considered severe or permanent or costmore than $15,000.;   Trial lawyers, who stand to lose a lot of business ifno-fault is adopted here, say they oppose the change because no-fault wouldtake away citizens' rights.;   Consumers would indeed lose out -- in arelatively few cases. But overall, California motorists would be far betteroff under the law proposed by Johnston.;   It's good that Garamendi says hehas seen the light. Perhaps in the future he will work for the adoption ofno-fault car insurance in a more timely and effective manner.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  James J.
