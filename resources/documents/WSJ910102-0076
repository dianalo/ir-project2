Eastern President Robert L. Gould said Monday that therecall &quot;allows us to move forward in a positive manner tosolve our remaining differences.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A federal appellate court last month upheld an earlierorder that Eastern rehire up to 800 pilots who struck inMarch 1989 and were told by the company they weren't neededwhen they ended their strike that November. Eastern earlierhad recalled about 140 pilots.   U.S. District Judge Edward Davis rejected Eastern'scontention that it didn't have to rehire former strikers inplace of newly hired pilots who were in training. Eastern hassaid it would continue appealing the ruling.   Mr. Gould said newly hired pilots wouldn't be laid off.   All but 200 of Eastern's 3,500 union pilots struck theunion, but dozens crossed picket lines to return to workbefore the union halted the strike.   Spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the company will recallthe most senior union pilots first, and they will enter acompany training program Jan. 15. She declined to say whenthey would resume flying and in what capacity.   E.J. Breen, spokesman for Eastern's pilots union, said therecall won't allow the strikers to come back as captains, butat lower-paying co-captain and flight engineer positions.</TEXT></DOC>
