Stocks also declined in Frankfurt, while the London market was closed for a holiday.    The Tokyo market's Nikkei index fell 299.81 points to close at 27379.10. The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section fell 22.50 to 2137.08. Volume on the first section was estimated at a slow 430 million shares. Estimated volume Friday, the last full day of trading before Monday, came to 450 million shares. In early trading Tuesday, the Nikkei stood at 27506.04, up 126.94 points.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange has a four-day settlement period, so Monday marked the beginning of the September trading month. Analysts were expecting that to help boost volume, because many salesmen try to start the new month with a bang. But in fact, the market's recent caution continued to hold sway.    &quot;The market was firmer early in the morning, helped by the beginning of September's trade, but it didn't last,&quot; said one trader. &quot;In this atmosphere, it is nearly impossible to buy.&quot;    Blue-chip auto makers and electricals were particularly hard-hit, although they were lower more on a lack of buying interest than on strong selling pressure. Steel stocks were also lower.    Pharmaceuticals, which were among the strongest sectors during the promising early moments of Monday's trading, fell back to end mostly lower.    Takeda Chemical Industries was down 110 yen to 2,660 yen ($19.85), while Yamanouchi fell 130 to 4,040.    Among auto makers, Toyota fell 70 to 2,600, while Honda was 70 lower at 2,070.    Among electricals, Toshiba closed at 1,020, down 50, while Hitachi fell 50 to 1,670, and Sony fell 210 to 6,620.    Kawasaki Steel closed 35 lower at 700, while NKK dropped 27 to 654.    &quot;The investment community . . . is in a waiting mode, but it's not very clear anymore what they're waiting for,&quot; said Simon Smithson, deputy general manager at Kleinwort Benson International Inc.    Mr. Smithson said that for the moment, investors are said to be awaiting U.S. unemployment figures for August due out this Friday, &quot;but after that is out of the way, they might just wait another month.&quot;    West German share prices closed generally lower on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in response to the continued weakness of the dollar and a lackluster performance on Wall Street Friday, brokers said.    The dollar's dive last week continued to weigh on export-oriented stocks, brokers said. Generally slow turnover, and the absence of London participants, compounded investors' wary mood, they said.    &quot;It was more the slow turnover {in New York Friday} than anything else that took the wind out of the market,&quot; said a senior analyst at a big West German bank.    Share price moves were more or less left to chance in the quiet market, brokers said.    Deutsche Bank tumbled 2.8 marks to 452.5 ($244), while Commerzbank was down 0.20 mark to 224 and Dresdner Bank gained 0.80 to 257.    In the auto sector, Daimler-Benz dropped 2.5 to 647.5, while Volkswagen was down 1.2 to 247, and Bayerische Motoren Werke eased 0.50 to 476.5.    Elsewhere, shares fell in Zurich, Amsterdam and Stockholm. Shares were mixed in Paris, Brussels and Milan.    Stocks closed lower in Sydney, Taipei, Singapore, Seoul and Wellington and were higher in Manila. The Hong Kong market was closed.    Taipei, which had been setting records almost daily, fell for the fifth consecutive session. The market's index has dropped 8.23% in that time.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
