The preliminary decision by Judge Robert W. Porter faulted the regulatory agency's freezing of funds owed to a healthy MCorp bank by a failed affiliate. Although limited in scope, the judge's opinion strikes at the heart of the FDIC's controversial practice of failing otherwise solvent banks by refusing to pay back funds lent to insolvent affiliates.    If upheld and applied in several similar cases, the decision could force the FDIC to pay millions of dollars in damages to the former owners of dozens of banks closed in Texas during the past year, including MCorp, First RepublicBank Corp., and Texas American Bancshares Inc.    &quot;The legal theory upon which the FDIC relied in each of those cases to create the insolvency of otherwise solvent banks has been flatly rejected by this court,&quot; said Howard Cayne, a partner with the Washington law firm Arnold andamp; Porter, which is representing MCorp.    An FDIC official declined to comment, other than to note that the judge's decision isn't yet final. Among other things, the judge still wants to consider the impact of the new savings-and-loan law, which explicitly grants the FDIC the authority to engineer such transactions. It isn't yet clear whether the new law can be applied retroactively. FDIC lawyers are expected to argue that the thrift bill merely clarified existing law, rather than rewriting it.    The lawsuit in question was brought by MCorp's New Braunfels, Texas, bank, which survived the March 28 seizure of 20 of the Dallas holding company's 25 banks. After the takeover, the FDIC refused to repay $17.1 million in federal funds that the New Braunfels bank had lent the company's lead Dallas bank. The bank now wants that money back.    Judge Porter's order, filed Aug. 29 and first reported in the American Banker, rejects the New Braunfels bank's request for a preliminary injunction requiring the FDIC to set aside the money needed for repayment. But the judge, citing a 100-year-old Supreme Court decision requiring all creditors be treated alike in a bank closing, indicated that he expects to rule in the plaintiff's favor.    The judge's logic appears to apply also to 12 former MCorp banks that allegedly failed only because the FDIC froze the funds they had lent to the Dallas bank. Regulators paid off creditors that weren't affiliated with MCorp.    A similar, regulator-inspired &quot;chain reaction&quot; led to the failure of dozens of otherwise solvent First RepublicBank Corp. banks last year, and to 14 of Texas American's 24 failed banks in July, according to lawsuits filed on behalf of those holding companies.    First RepublicBank's former units are currently owned by NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C. First RepublicBank hasn't any connection with First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco. Regulators are in the process of selling Texas American's failed banks to Dallas-based Deposit Guaranty Bank. MCorp's 20 failed banks were sold to Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio.    It is unclear what relief the former owners would receive if the FDIC is held to have acted illegally in all those instances. In the most extreme case, the government could be forced to return to the holding companies all those banks in which it &quot;manufactured&quot; the insolvencies. But most analysts doubt that would occur.    &quot;If the FDIC is wrong they can't say 'we're sorry, we'll give you the banks back,&quot;' says Robert Rieke, an analyst with Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Dallas. &quot;The fair response is that the fair value of the banks would revert back&quot; to the former holding companies.    MCorp, for example, has asserted in a lawsuit similar to the New Braunfels complaint, that the allegedly unlawfully seized banks were worth a total of $70 million. MCorp was particularly cheered by the New Braunfels decision, because its lawsuit is being heard by the same judge. </TEXT></DOC>
