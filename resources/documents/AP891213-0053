The destroyer Saguenay fired on the Concordia during a 12-hourchase off Cape Cod that began when Canadian authorities allegedlyspotted the boat poaching for scallops in Canadian waters.   The accounts given Tuesday of the confrontation between Capt.William Furey Jr.'s Concordia and the Saguenay varied widely. Therewere no injuries and no charges were filed, though Canadianofficials said they were investigating.   The episode appeared to be the most serious since 2,200 membersof the Canadian fishing patrol went on strike a month ago, leavingtheir territorial waters vulnerable and posing what Canadianauthorities say is a temptation for American fishermen.   The U.S. vessel was spotted five times during several dayspoaching scallops 2.5 nautical miles over an internationalfisheries line, said Carl Goodwin, chief of surveillance at theCanadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The line was set bythe World Court at The Hague in 1984, after a long dispute betweenthe two countries.   ``It is not our intent to harass American fishermen,'' Goodwinsaid from his Halifax office. ``We're not just a bunch of cavalierpeople who are running around firing at innocent Americanfishermen.''   The 366-foot Saguenay fired about 10 warning shots near the114-foot Concordia during the chase. The two boats collided andeach skipper accused the other of ramming his boat.   The Canadian destroyer pursued the Concordia from 130 miles offCape Cod through international waters until a Coast Guard cutterpicked the scalloper up early Tuesday at the American 12-mileboundary and escorted it to New Bedford.   Kenneth Crossman, a special agent with the U.S. National MarineFisheries Service, said officials boarded the scalloper in NewBedford, near the scalloper's home port of Fairhaven, to confirmthe captain's identity and to examine the catch.   Crossman said federal charges would be filed against theConcordia only if solid evidence was presented by Canadianofficials.   Furey said his charts never indicated he was in Canadianterritory. He also said he and his 10-member crew recharted theircourse early Monday after a Canadian plane flew by and ordered themnot to move until a warship arrived.   ``I wasn't going to stop the vessel and wait for a warship,'' hesaid. ``I was fishing, not at war.''   Furey, 31, said the destroyer eventually overtook his boat and,when he refused to stop, rammed it three times.   ``If we had been a wooden boat, we'd be cut in half,'' he said.``The crew hit the deck. I shut off all the boat's lights and keptweaving.''   Naval vessels have been patrolling Canadian waters since crewfrom the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans began a strikefor higher wages four weeks ago.   Goodwin said the strike had paralyzed much of the government'sfishing patrol and left Canadian waters vulnerable to Americanpoachers, who he alleged have crossed the World Court line on``almost a daily basis.''   ``It's our firm belief that those fishermen know exactly wherethe line is,'' Goodwin said. ``It has been there for quite a whilenow and they've been given ample time to get the necessary chartsand chart their course properly out there.''</TEXT></DOC>
