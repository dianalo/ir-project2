Woolworth Co. in downtown Boston, thesweaters are on sale, jelly beans are two bags for a dollar and thegun of the month is an M-1 semi-automatic carbine.   It's no toy, and City Councilor David Scondras wants thedepartment store and other stores to stop selling assault weapons.   ``Woolworth's is viewed as a wholesome American store, every kidin America knows about Woolworth's,'' Scondras said Friday. ``Whenyou say it's OK to sell something at Woolworth's then it sends amessage ... It sanctions the buying and selling of assaultweapons,'' he said.   The high number of gun-related deaths in Boston's neighborhoodsalong with the easy availability of assault weapons has led Scondrasand nine other council members to introduce a measure that wouldoutlaw the sale of assault weapons in the city. The council has 13members.   ``It'll be brought to a vote before the end of March. By Aprilthey won't be selling them,'' he said. The measure would not banstandard handguns.   Los Angeles and Stockton, Calif., have banned military-style,semi-automatic assault weapons recently in the aftermath of thekilling of five elementary students in Stockton. Last month, a manused an assault rifle to spray a schoolyard with 100 bullets withintwo minutes.   Ordinances banning the weapons have also been introduced in NewYork, New Orleans and Cleveland, as well as Maryland, Florida andWisconsin.   Robert Giroux, manager of the downtown store who refused tocomment on Scondras' complaints, said several other Woolworth'sstores sell firearms. Telephone calls to the company's New Yorkheadquarters were not returned Friday.   ``Gun of the Month'' has long been a feature in the Woolworth'ssporting goods department, located across from the children'ssection and upstairs from the pet shop, where finches were markeddown below half-price Friday.   The M-1 carbine, a smaller, lighter version of the .30-caliberrifle of the U.S. Army in World War II, was on sale for $199.99.   Scondras also was disturbed by a bolt-action rifle with a bayoneton display at the store.   ``You're not going to tell me that when you're selling a bayonetand a military weapon, and all this military imagery, you're selling(hunting gear),'' he said. ``You're pushing a fantasy for Rambo.''   Giroux said the bayonet was removed after the councilor'scomplaints were publicized.   Woolworth's sports department sells fishing gear, bows andarrows, bowie knives, shotguns and a limited variety of otherrifles, but no handguns.   Assault weapons ``aren't appealing to recreational sports,they're appealing to Rambo,'' Scondras said. ``We've been sendingthis wrong message for a long time, that you deal with your problemsby blowing away your enemies.''</TEXT></DOC>
