In one constitutional case after another, Justice Scaliais asserting that the Constitution, especially the Bill ofRights and the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process,must be interpreted in light of historical practice andtradition.</LP><TEXT>   Occasionally, this approach produces surprising results.That was the case last week when Justice Scalia wrote anopinion dissenting from the high court's decision that anindividual arrested without a warrant may be detained bypolice for as many as 48 hours without arranging a courthearing to determine if the arrest was valid.   Justice Scalia, generally the court's most conservativemember, was with the court's liberal wing in this case,interpreting the Fourth Amendment protection against&quot;unreasonable. . .seizures.&quot; He said the court's conclusioncontradicted historical practice that &quot;already existed in1791&quot; when the Bill of Rights was ratified and that &quot;has beengenerally adhered to by the traditions of our society eversince.&quot; The historical practice, he said, was that anofficial who arrests an individual without a warrant must getthe person to a judge or magistrate &quot;as soon as he reasonablycan.&quot;   More often than not, however, Justice Scalia's historicalanalysis provides a forceful rationale for a conservativedecision.   Last month in another case, he traced the legal history ofthe word &quot;seizure&quot; in a majority ruling. He wrote that anindividual who flees at the sight of the police who have nobasis to suspect him isn't &quot;seized&quot; for purposes of theFourth Amendment and, therefore, can't try to excludeevidence as the fruits of an unlawful arrest. &quot;A ship stillfleeing, even though under attack, would not be considered tohave been seized as a war prize,&quot; he wrote, citing an 1825Supreme Court decision.   Richard Bernstein, a Washington lawyer and former lawclerk to Justice Scalia, says the dissenting opinion on howlong police can hold a person after a warrantless arrest&quot;shows that his is an intellectually honest method that willbe followed even when it leads to liberal results.&quot;   But the approach has its critics, too. &quot;History seems tobe too unambiguous in his portrayal,&quot; says Daniel Farber, aprofessor at the University of Minnesota Law School. &quot;Hedoesn't ever seem to find any ambiguity.&quot;   Justice Scalia's view, which he expounds with great vigorin his court opinions, isn't simply a rekindling of thedebate five years ago about whether the meaning of theConstitution should be limited to the &quot;original intent&quot; ofthose who wrote it in 1787. That position seemed to lose muchof its vociferousness when Edwin Meese resigned as attorneygeneral in 1988.   Justice Scalia's approach is more complex. He looks firstto the text of the Constitution, but when the words of theConstitution don't provide an answer, he examines the historyof court precedents, known as the common law, sometimes evenpredating the Constitution.   In the warrantless arrest case, he said that when there isa tradition that existed when the Bill of Rights was adopted&quot;it is the function of the Bill of Rights to preserve thatjudgment, not only against the changing views of presidentsand members of Congress, but also against the changing viewsof justices. . . &quot;   Some law professors reject this approach. &quot;I don't know ofany clear indication that the framers intended to incorporatethe common law in the Bill of Rights,&quot; says Michael Seidman,a professor at Georgetown University Law School.   Justice Scalia's most frequent use of history is ininterpreting the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of dueprocess. He ignited a heated debate in 1989 by asserting thatdue process only protects &quot;an interest traditionallyprotected by our society.&quot; Justice William Brennan took theopposing view that that was far too narrow a reading of thedue-process guarantee, but his retirement last July removedfrom the court the strongest challenge to Justice Scalia'sapproach.   ---   FAST TRACK? Before Justice David Souter was picked toreplace Justice Brennan last July, some pundits saidPresident Bush should pick an Hispanic to help cement thatvoting bloc in the Republican camp. Speculation included thename of a little-known federal district judge, RicardoHinojosa of McAllen, Texas, appointed by Ronald Reagan in1983. Judge Hinojosa took a big leap from obscurity last weekwhen he attended the state dinner for Queen Elizabeth.</TEXT></DOC>
