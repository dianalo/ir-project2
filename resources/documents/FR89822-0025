These procedures definethe types of facility projects for which the Postal Service prepares environmentalassessments. Regulations concerning floodplains and wetlands appear in39 CFR 776.The categories of projects for which an environmental assessment is normallynot done (referred to as categorical exclusions in andSection; 775.4(b))are being revised in order to clarify, update, and extend them.Section 775.4(b)(1) is being replaced with new andSection; 775.4(b)(1) andandSection; 775.4(b)(5) to accommodate new real estate techniques such aslandbanking and advance acquisition of sites. Advance site acquisitionis used in ``tight'' real estate markets or to take advantage of real estateopportunities. Landbanking is used to acquire land in high-growth areas,where a future need for facilities is anticipated but specific needs orprojects have not been identified. The revised criteria do not providefor environmental assessments for advance site acquisition and acquisitionof land under landbanking procedures because the process of acquisitiondoes not have environmental impacts. However, any plan for us or disposalof such land would be subject to applicable review requirements under thissection.New andSection; 775.4(b)(2) is added, and the first part of andSection; 775.4(b)(3)is amended to account for length of occupancy. Also, the former test forexclusion that there be no ``enlarged occupancy'' is changed to requirethat there be no ``significant'' change in the use of the property. Underproposed andSection; 775.4(b)(2) those buildings acquired through purchase,lease, or exchange under 50,000 net interior square feet with occupancyof more than 90 days would not require an environment assessment. Underproposed andSection; 775.4(b)(3) leasing buildings of any size for occupancyof 90 days or less would not require an environmental assessment. Temporaryoccupancies are viewed as not having environmental impacts of a naturewarranting an environmental assessment.Current andSection; 775.4(b)(2) is renumbered andSection; 775.4(b)(4) and amendedto propose that the expansion or improvement of an existing postal facilitywould not involve an environmental assessment unless the gross square footageis to be increased 30,000 square feet or more. The revision conforms thisthreshold with that for the construction of a new building and reflectspostal experience that renovation projects below this threshold do notinvolve significant environmental impacts.The second part of current andSection; 775.4(b)(3) is renumberd andSection;775.4(b)(10) and amended to refer to planned postal uses, instead of thesize of the operation.Current andSection; 775.4(b)(4) is renumbered andSection; 775.4(b)(7).Current andSection; 775.4(b)(5) is renumbered andSection; 775.4(b)(9) and amendedto provide an exclusion for disposal of improved real estate either throughsale or outlease involving under 30,000 net interior square feet.Section andSection; 775.4(b)(6) is amended to provide that routine protectionand maintenance of properties are excluded unless they alter the configurationof the building.Current andSection; 775.4(b)(7) is renumbered andSection; 775.4(b)(15).An exclusion is being proposed as new andSection; 775.4(b)(8) for obtaining,granting, disposing, or changing easements, licenses and permits, and similarinterests, since no environmental impacts have been associated with theseactions.Current andSection; 775.4(b)(8) is renumbered andSection; 775.4(b)(13) andamended to add an exclusion for the procurement or disposal of mail handlingequipment. Experience has shown that the procurement and disposal of mailhandling equipment does not involve environmental impacts.Current andSection; 775.4(b)(9) is renumbered andSection; 775.4(b)(14).An exclusion is proposed as new andSection; 775.4(b)(11) for the extension,renewal, renegotiation, or termination of existing lease agreements. Again,experience has shown that these actions do not create environmental impacts.An exclusion is proposed as new andSection; 775.4(b)(12) for joint developmentand/or joint-use projects involving construction under 30,000 net interiorsquare feet. Experience has shown that the degree of impacts does not differwhether construction within this limit is for ownership or lease.Section andSection; 775.6(a)(1)(ii) is being amended to make reference toa set of internal review procedures for assisting in the determinationof extraordinary circumstances, which, if found, would lead to a preparationof an environmental assessment. In addition, andSection; 775.6(b)(3) wouldbe changed to make it clear that under appropriate circumstances, continuedcontrol of competing sites for purposes of this regulation could be accomplishedby advance acquisition.In the EIS evaluation process, the reference to ``worst-case'' analysisof alternatives in andSection; 775.8(b)(6) would be replaced with a requirementto evaluate alternatives based on reasonably foreseeable future conditions.This change is made to be consistent with changes made in regulations ofthe Council on Environmental Quality. See 40 CFR 1502.22(b). The Postal Service's planning process for facilities projects no longerrequires the preparation of studies entitled ``Site Planning Report'' and``Economic Analysis Report,'' the names used in part 776. Changes are proposedto require that the same information be collected and analysis performed,and the same determinations made, without specifying the names of the analyticaldocuments. Other changes would conform the regulations more closely toExecutive Orders on floodplains and wetlands. In view of the above considerations, the Postal Service proposes to amend39 CFR parts 775 and 776 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 39 CFR Parts 775 and 776 </ITAG>Environmental Assessments, Environmental Impact Statements, FloodplainManagement and Protection of Wetlands Procedures.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 775_ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEDURES </ITAG>1.

Section 775.4(b) is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;775.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Typical classes of action. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(b) <T3>Categorical exclusions. </T3>The classes of action in paragraphs (b)(1) through (15) of this section normally do not require either an environmentalassessment or an environmental impact statement. However, the responsibleofficial must be alert to unusual conditions that would require an environmentalassessment or an environmental impact statement notwithstanding the applicabilityof a categorical exclusion to particular action. (1) New construction, Postal Service owned, including site acquisitionby any method, or Postal Service leased, of less than 30,000 net interiorsquare feet. (2) Acquisition by purchase, lease, or exchange, of existing buildingscontaining less than 50,000 net interior square feet with occupancy ofgreater than 90 days where planned postal uses do not differ significantlyfrom past uses of the site. (3) Lease of existing buildings of any size for occupancy of 90 days orless. (4) Expansion or improvement of an existing facility where the expansiondoes not exceed 30,000 net interior square feet. (5) Acquisition of unimproved real property not connected to specific facilityplans or when necessary to protect the interests of the Postal Servicein advance of final project approval. This categorical exclusion appliesonly to the acquisition. Any subsequent use of the property for a facilityproject must be considered under this part without regard to ownershipof the real property. (6) Routine actions normally conducted to protect and maintain propertiesand which do not alter the configuration of the building. (7) Repair to, or replacement-in-kind of, building equipment or components(e.g., electrical distribution, HVAC systems, doors, windows, roofs, etc.).(8) Obtaining, granting, disposing, or changing of easements, licensesand permits, rights-of-way and similar interests. (9) Disposal through sale or outlease of unimproved real property of anysize or improved real estate under 30,000 net interior square feet. (10) Purchase of Postal Service occupied leased property where plannedpostal uses do not differ significantly from past uses of the site. (11) Extension, renewal, renegotiation, or termination of existing leaseagreements. (12) Joint development and/or joint-use projects involving constructionunder 30,000 net interior square feet. (13) Procurement or disposal of motor vehicles not involving a substantialincrease in the concentration of vehicles in a geographic impact area.Procurement or disposal of mail handling equipment. (14) Postal rate or mail classification actions. (15) Postal facility function changes not involving construction, the relocationof a substantial number of employees, or a substantial increase in thenumber of motor vehicles at a facility. 3.
