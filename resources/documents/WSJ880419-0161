Albert Gore Jr., including the candidate's 80-year-old father, pays his respects to Larry Daughtrey, a reporter from the Tennessean.    A few weeks earlier, Boston Globe reporter Joan Vennochi was on her last campaign trip with the Dukakis campaign before returning to Boston, when Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, went to the back of the plane to present a giant chocolate cake topped with a &quot;Dukakis for President&quot; bumper sticker.    These journalists get special treatment by the candidates they cover for one reason: They report for the candidates' hometown newspapers. It is through these reporters' eyes that the candidates' constituents, neighbors and closest supporters view the campaign. No matter what the outcome of these Democrats' presidential bids, their hometown newspapers will continue to cover them, sometimes with their arms around -- rather than at arms length from -- the candidate.    &quot;A hometown newspaper is obligated to tell the story for an audience of enthusiasts, producing a built-in tension between professional standards and boosterism,&quot; says Stephen Hess, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. Finlay Lewis, who was the hometown reporter from the Minneapolis Star and Tribune covering Democratic candidate Walter Mondale in 1984, says, &quot;The most obvious problem with hometown journalism is one of proportion and balance.&quot;    The tendency to hometown boosterism rankles some. &quot;The hometown paper can be a candidate's best cheerleader,&quot; charges Todd Domke, a Republican political consultant in Boston, who complains that the Globe has been that for Gov. Dukakis.    The Boston Globe and Nashville's Tennessean, both considered first-rate newspapers, are pouring substantial resources into campaign coverage and devoting huge amounts of space to the hometown candidate.    The Globe has assigned 20 reporters and three editors to work full time on the presidential campaign. It has at least one reporter with Gov. Dukakis at all times. Currently, Andrew Blake is traveling with the governor after spending the past five years covering the Massachusetts statehouse. He can readily tell when Mr. Dukakis utters something new. When the ever-cautious governor recently said &quot;damn&quot; once and &quot;hell&quot; twice, Mr. Blake recorded it. He knows the candidate's stump speech so well that at a recent rally in New York, Mr. Blake mimicked nearly every word as Mr. Dukakis spoke.    The Globe has run some tough stories about Gov. Dukakis. After campaign manager John Sasso resigned for providing videotapes leading to Sen. Joseph Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race, the Globe jumped all over the story, saying that Mr. Dukakis's presidential bid had &quot;suffered a serious setback.&quot; A recent article laid out the problems some Massachusetts lawmakers are having with the governor's lengthy absences from the state, under the headline, &quot;Dukakis Road Show Has Some Worried About the Home Front.&quot;    More often, however, the Globe's campaign coverage favorably highlights Mr. Dukakis. After the Super Tuesday round of primaries last month, for example, the Globe called Gov. Dukakis &quot;the leader in the race for the nomination&quot; when the rest of the news media saw the results as producing a three-way race with the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Sen. Gore.    &quot;On certain days, the Globe's desire to coronate Dukakis comes out loud and clear,&quot; says Mark Jurkowitz, media critic for the Boston Phoenix, a weekly newspaper.    The now-defunct campaign of Rep. Richard Gephardt from Missouri argues that the Globe's coverage of Mr. Dukakis going into the New Hampshire primary was so excessive that it hurt Mr. Gephardt. &quot;The Globe acts as the assignment editor for Boston TV, so it had an extraordinary effect on the New Hampshire primary,&quot; Edward Reilly, a strategist for the Gephardt campaign, says.    John Driscoll, editor of the Globe, disagrees and says that &quot;this isn't the first time out for us,&quot; alluding to the presidential campaigns of John F., Robert F. and Edward M. Kennedy. Once the primaries began, he says, the Globe covered the Dukakis campaign &quot;more from a national perspective than a local perspective.&quot;    Benjamin Taylor, the Globe's executive editor, says, &quot;It's important for us to be the authority on Dukakis, not to be pro-Dukakis or anti-Dukakis.&quot;    But some Globe reporters acknowledge holding an enthusiastic view of Gov. Dukakis.    &quot;I have a favorable view of him,&quot; political reporter Chris Black says. &quot;My outlook and ideology can't be divorced from my copy, but as a reporter I try to be dispassionate.&quot; She says she occasionally drops an &quot;adjective or phrase&quot; so her stories won't appear too favorable to Mr. Dukakis. Ms. Black expects the governor will win in November. &quot;I would love to come to Washington,&quot; she says.    At the Tennessean, reporters are covering not only the hometown boy making good but also a former journalistic colleague. &quot;Literally 12 years ago, Al was sitting in front of me and asking me for help on his stories,&quot; says Mr. Daughtrey, whose family has vacationed and socialized with the Gore family.    Despite those ties -- or perhaps because of them -- the Tennessean's coverage of Sen. Gore has been mixed.    When Sen. Gore disclosed that he had smoked marijuana in the past, including when he was at the Tennessean, the newspaper treated it as a major event, publishing several articles about what it called &quot;the confession.&quot; It not only carried the story on Mr. Gore's disclosure but also ran one on how the campaign agonized over what to do and another one headlined &quot;Gore's Ex-Colleagues Surprised at Pot Use.&quot;    The Nashville newspaper carried strong columns by Mr. Daughtrey and others criticizing disorganization and financial secrecy in the Gore campaign. But Edward Kimbrell, a journalism professor at Middle Tennessee State University, says he detects a &quot;delay&quot; in reporting negative developments about Mr. Gore's campaign, &quot;as if to say let's wait to see if things improve.&quot;    When Sen. Gore placed a distant third in the Wisconsin primary, the Tennessean reported that the senator &quot;bolstered his White House bid with a solid third place.&quot; And when reporting about Sen. Gore borrowing money for campaign advertising, a Tennessean headline put the action in the most positive light: &quot;Gore Climbs Media Spending Ladder.&quot;    Supporters of Mr. Jackson in Tennessee are especially angry at the paper's campaign coverage.    &quot;Most black Nashvilleans have been concerned that the Tennessean's reporting is slanted toward Gore,&quot; the Rev. Wallace Charles Smith, a Jackson backer in Nashville, says.    But John Seigenthaler, the Tennessean's publisher, says its readers want to know &quot;every time Al Gore belches, so they can say you're excused.&quot; (It was Mr. Seigenthaler who tipped Sen. Gore to the impending retirement of the congressman whose seat Mr. Gore ran for and won in 1976.) He adds, &quot;If he (Mr. Gore) had never been a reporter here, it would have been easier.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
