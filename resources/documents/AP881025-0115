(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wildlife officials combed Pelican Islandon Tuesday for clues to a mysterious malady that has killed morethan 100 brown pelicans and left scores of others blinded andweakened.   State biologists speculated that a larval parasite that attacksthe birds' eyes and head had spread among the large population onthis small island in the Halifax River south of Daytona Beach.   Among the dead or dying birds in the mangroves on the400-yard-long island were several snowy egrets.   Carcasses of some dead pelicans and several sickened birds,including a snowy egret, were being studied at the veterinaryhospital at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Officialsthere said it could take days or weeks to determine a cause.   Veterinarians and animal specialists were stunned by the deaths.   ``It's almost like a leprosy,'' said Carol Swain, a wildliferehabilitator. ``It's eating away, rotting their skulls. The bonewas almost exposed.''   ``Nobody's ever seen it like this,'' said Michele Yown, a MarinePatrol officer.   In efforts to prevent spread of the disease, Swain and colleaguesgave lethal injections to 38 blinded birds, which were thencremated, on Monday.   The sick birds are lethargic and easy to catch.   ``You can walk right up to them,'' said Swain. ``If you can catchit (a bird), there's something wrong with it.''   Lt. Vernon Hitt of the Florida Game and Fresh Water FishCommission said the birds become disoriented, losing their abilityto fly or walk well. Other game officials said the birds did notappear to have been poisoned, and they did not believe pollution wasto blame.   No similar problems were found on neighboring small islands, mostof which are made from dredge material like Pelican Island.   Paul Minshew, assistant director of environmental health for theVolusia County Health Department, said it was unlikely that thebirds' disease can spread to humans.   ``I've never heard any reports of diseases that go from pelicansor snowy egrets to humans,'' he said. ``It appears to be veryspecific to the two species.''   The brown pelican was removed from the endangered-species listalong the Atlantic Coast in 1985, when the population swelled,according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.   Donald Forrester, a University of Florida veterinarian, saidpelicans occasionally die in large numbers around the state.   One of three things is usually to blame, Forrester said: blood inthe intestines, starvation, or an abnormally high number of stomachworms that result when pelicans change their diet from one speciesof fish to another.   He declined to speculate about the deadly malady on PelicanIsland.</TEXT></DOC>
