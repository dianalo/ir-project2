(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   2 Live Crew took X-rated pokes at locallaw officials, but performed without incident just hours after arecord store owner was arrested for selling the rap group's ``AsNasty As They Wanna Be.''   ``This city has a lot greater problems to deal with than who isperforming at Club Nu,'' City Commissioner Bruce Singer said beforeFriday night's show.   The Miami rappers played for 45 minutes to a packed house atClub Nu, which holds about 1,500. They took profanity-laced verbaljabs at Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro and Gov. Bob Martinez,who have attacked the group's sexually explicit lyrics.   On Saturday, about 150 anti-censorship activists staged a briefprotest at the Coral Gables home of Jack Thompson, an attorney whohas campaigned to get 2 Live Crew's records removed from area musicstores.   The protestors left after about 15 minutes when policeresponding to neighbors' complaints told the group they lacked apermit for the demonstration, said police Sgt. Dennis Koronkiewicz.Coral Gables is a suburb of Miami.   About 15 police officers and a small crowd of several hundredpeople were on hand as the rappers performed an early, clean showfor patrons of all ages Saturday night at Hollywood's Club Futura.Band members expected a larger audience and a livelier show duringan adults-only set later Saturday at the club.   ``We're gonna do 2 Live, nasty as they wanna be,'' band leaderLuther Campbell vowed, speaking of the second show.   A spokesman for Hollywood police said that would be fine _ atleast in the short run.   ``We are not going to jump up and stop the show and run the riskof having some kind of wild riot and have to take a lot of peopleto jail,'' Ed Cunningham said Saturday. ``If something happens thatappears it does violate the judge's order, we'll document it andwe're going to forward it to the judge or the state attorney'soffice for Broward County.''   U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled Wednesday that themillion-selling album, released more than a year ago, is obscene bycommunity standards in Broward, Dade and Palm Beach counties.   That cleared the way for Friday's arrest of Charles Freeman,owner of E-C Records, who sold copies of the recording to anundercover deputy. He faces a first-degree misdemeanor charge andis free on $100 bond.   If convicted, he could be jailed for a year and fined $1,000.   Both Freeman and Campbell said they had gotten supportive phonecalls Friday from rock star Frank Zappa, a vocal opponent ofcensorship.   Campbell also pledged his financial, legal and moral support toretailers who have problems after selling the record. He is ownerand president of 2 Live Crew's record label, now called Luke'sbecause of copyright problems with the former name Luke Skyywalker.   The obscenity ruling brought new interest in the group, apromoter said.   ``Until this trial, we never could have booked this group onsuch short notice, with no time (to advertise) and still expect afull house,'' said Club Nu promoter Bob Slade. ``They're morepopular than ever now.''   Campbell was enjoying all the free publicity.   ``I can't pay for this advertising,'' he said at a Friday newsconference held in the two-story building he recently purchased tohouse his recording empire.   ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' a double album, has sold morethan 1.7 million copies.   ``The machines are running right now,'' Campbell he said,smiling.</TEXT></DOC>
