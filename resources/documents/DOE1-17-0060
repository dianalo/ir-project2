No small angle neutron scattering couldbe observed from any of the glasses. The neutron powder diffraction profilewas measured and the calculated radial distribution functions resemblethose of vitreous silica. Five broad bands are observed in the Ramanspectra and they are interpreted principally as stretching vibrationsof T-O-T bonds (T is a tetrahedral cation). A high degree of depolymerisationof the intermediate structure of the glasses is inferred.</TEXT></DOC>
