Lesser members of the party aristocracy -- Hamilton, Gore and Gephardt -- have traveled to Boston for interviews and conferrals with the candidate. Lloyd Bentsen, as befits a political man from Texas, made the candidate also travel to him. What we are now witnessing is the elaborate fandango by which a liberal Northern nominee will arrive at the side of his strongest Southern suitor.    Senator Sam Nunn, of course, is out there posturing with the other Hamlets, Mario Cuomo and Bill Bradley. We think he's running. Why? Unlike Governor Cuomo and Senator Bradley, this is Mr. Nunn's best if not only shot to become President of the United States. He'll never arrive there except through the vice presidential route.    The Senator's problem, even for the vice presidency, is that he's unacceptable to the party's left. It is alleged that some dark period in the Senator's legislative past keeps him from entering polite Democratic society today. The Nation magazine characteristically makes the party's Social Register case against Mr. Nunn:   &quot;On civil rights, Nunn has apparently cared more about protecting the putative sensitivities of white voters in Georgia than demonstrating leadership.&quot; We then learn that Mr. Nunn voted 13 years ago against renewing the Voting Rights Act and by 1982 he &quot;equivocated, but finally he did vote for the bill.&quot; There also was an unacceptable vote against abortion in 1983, and he &quot;now supports federal funding for abortion only in limited cases.&quot;    So Senator Nunn needs someone to absolve him of these unforgivable sins against party orthodoxy. Of course only Jesse Jackson can do this. Similarly, Mr. Dukakis must at some point be seen making a significant concession to Rev. Jackson, while preserving his own relatively new standing in the national party. To accomplish this, he will hand Rev. Jackson a single veto. With this, Jesse Jackson through his aides is currently sending the 1988 presidential career of Tennessee's Albert Gore Jr. to oblivion.    With no deep asset other than his Southernness, Mr. Gore becomes the sacrifice for Rev. Jackson's demand that the party honor the sensibilities of Southern black voters. This done, the Rev. Jackson, a realist, can support a chastened Senator Nunn.    That still leaves the question of conforming Senator Nunn's strategic-thinker reputation with the party's neo-isolationist, Paul-Kennedy wing. Well, we were never comfortable with the argument that Mr. Nunn's ABM battle with Abe Sofaer merely reflected his concern for preserving senatorial prerogatives. In retrospect, Senator Biden's championing of this cause during the INF debate makes it clearer that the political result of the Sofaer battle was an appeased Democratic caucus. They, too, come on board.    Still, the partners must somehow land on vectors leading to the same point. As befits austere politicians of the mind, Messrs. Dukakis and Nunn converge via the position paper. Governor Dukakis offered his world views recently in a speech to the Atlantic Council. Lo, in the midst of the selection process, Senator Nunn suddenly appears this past weekend on the New York Times op-ed page with a vast essay on NATO, which began: &quot;Next January the new President will confront. . . .&quot; The essay was written in grand language -- grander than that normally used by Senators, perhaps not so grand as someone running for the presidency. In between. </TEXT></DOC>
