Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6900, downfrom 1.6935 marks late Tuesday in New York. The U.S. currencyalso was trading at 134.80 yen, unchanged. Sterling fetched$1.7310, up from $1.7295.</LP><TEXT>   In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 134.33yen, down a bit from Tokyo's Wednesday close of 134.75 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6840 marks,down from 1.6903 marks on Wednesday.   A late bout of dollar dumping, rumored to be from BankNegara, the Malaysian central bank, and other players, erasedslim gains made earlier in the day. Spokesmen for BankNegara's offices in New York and Kuala Lumpur declined tocomment on market talk attributing the dollar's late slump tothe central bank.   &quot;It was really quiet and then all of a sudden, out ofnowhere, the dollar dropped,&quot; said Judy Rubenstein, a vicepresident and trader at Bank of America in Los Angeles.   She said the selling probably triggered corporate sellorders that added to the dollar's losses.   The dollar fell swiftly to 1.6930 marks from 1.6960 marks.It hovered at the lower level for about 30 minutes beforecrashing through support at the previous intraday low at1.6900 marks. The dollar's intraday low yesterday was 1.6875marks.   Ms. Rubenstein said the selling may have heightened thedollar's vulnerability, and added that the currency couldfall to 1.6850 marks or 1.6700 marks overnight.   The dollar traded in a narrow range earlier in the globalday, finding modest support among players becoming lesscertain of the widely anticipated cut in U.S. interest rates.   Since Friday, the market has been selling the dollar,bracing itself for a cut in U.S. interest rates that wouldstimulate the sluggish U.S. economy but would makedollar-based investments less attractive to overseasinvestors.   The market is geared for a half-percentage-point cut inthe 5.5% discount rate, the U.S. Federal Reserve's leastexpensive form of lending. A quarter-point reduction isexpected in the 5.5% target for federal funds. The federalfunds rate is the rate banks charge one another for overnightloans.   But yesterday, some traders began buying dollars back, ineffect pricing a portion of the expected easing out of thedollar's value, said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange managerat Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.   The buying, abetted by intraday speculative purchases,lifted the dollar to its session peak of 1.7020 marks duringthe North American morning. The dollar also rose to 135.20yen during the North American afternoon.   &quot;Dollar bulls are probably getting a little bit morecomfortable,&quot; Mr. Pettit said of longer-term market players,explaining that comfort was what helped underpin the dollaryesterday.   Mr. Pettit said bulls and bears appear to be evenlymatched, with &quot;fairly large&quot; positions in both camps. Butbears, including himself, had &quot;hoped that the Fed would haveeased by this time in the week,&quot; he said.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $345.40 an ounce, down $4.50. Estimatedvolume was a moderate 4.2 million ounces. en   In Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was quoted at $345.60 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
