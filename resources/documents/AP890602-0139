The boy, his mother and a lawyer for the city are to make thetrip Sunday to the M.D. Anderson institute at the University ofTexas in Houston.   The agreement was reached with the city, the parents and thejudge, who on Thursday returned the 4-year-old boy toMemorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, from which his father tookhim in violation of a court order.   The father, Steven Pagan, 36, surrendered with his son, Darian,on Thursday after hearing that his wife, Migdalia, had been jailedbecause of his action.   Deutsch returned Darian to the custody of the city's ChildWelfare Administration and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.He ordered an examination of Darian but specifically prohibiteddoctors at Sloan-Kettering from administering any treatment withouthis consent.   The dispute began when the parents objected to a plannedchemotherapy treatment, which could be painful.   The judge imposed a 10-day suspended sentence against Pagan forcontempt of court and freed Mrs. Pagan, 35, who had spent the lasttwo nights in jail.   ``Their feelings are confusion, relief and apprehension,'' saidthe parents' lawyer, Steven Mandel. ``They still have a child withleukemia and this is something no parent should have to go tothrough.''   Darian was hospitalized last Friday under an order from Deutschthat was requested by the Child Welfare Administration becausehospital officials said the boy was not getting the treatment heneeded.   The city became involved in the case after doctors fromSloan-Kettering called them and said Darian was in imminent dangerif he did not receive a radical form of radiation and chemotherapy,which the parents had resisted.   The Pagans, who live in Brooklyn, are Jehovah's Witnesses, areligion that opposes blood transfusions. But Mandel said theirreligion did not play a part in the court case.</TEXT></DOC>
