As Iraqis jammed roads out of the capital, U.S. DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney said today in Saudi Arabia that war with Iraqwas increasingly likely. ``Absolute, total victory'' is the onlyoption if war breaks out, he said.   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was no less confident, predictingvictory in any war with the U.S.-led multinational forces. He alsostood by his refusal to pull out of Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadline.   Germany's ZDF television network broadcast the Saddam interviewtoday, saying it had been conducted in Baghdad on Thursday.   ``In the event of war, there will be great losses, not just interms of human life. Those who now say yes to war will beresponsible,'' Saddam said. ``Allah is on our side, so we willdefeat the aggressors.''   In Germany today, the government said it was investigating U.S.suspicions that German companies are violating trade sanctionsagainst Iraq. One firm denied giving Iraq sensitive nuclearknow-how and equipment.   The government confirmed a report that Washington has given it alist of German companies suspected of violating the U.N. embargo.Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said the U.S. allegations werebeing investigated but no proof has been found of deliveries thatviolate the sanctions.   President Bush was to meet later today with John Major,Britain's new prime minister. In several television interviewstoday, Major said the question of war was ``in Saddam Hussein'shands.''   Also today, the U.S. military command said eight Americansoldiers have been poisoned by home-brewed alcohol and hospitalizedsince Sunday.   The soldiers, from the 101st Airborne Division, are the firstknown casualties of home-brewed liquor since U.S. forces weredeployed in Saudi Arabia, a Moslem country that bans all alcohol.   During the evacuation drill many Iraqis stayed home, residentssaid.   Participants ran on foot to civil defense centers in Baghdad orsped out of town in cars. Hundreds of buses waiting at centers tookIraqis to shelters north, east and south of the city.   Roads leading out of the capital were jammed with thousands ofcars, trucks, buses and even carriages pulled by tractors.The drillbegan at 7 a.m. and ended five hours later.   Iraq has been preparing for war since the U.N. Security Councilauthorized force to remove Iraq from Kuwait if it does not leavethe emirate by Jan. 15. Iraqi media carry instructions for buildingbomb shelters and courses in civil defense and first-aid.   U.S. officials have suggested Iraq's cities could be bombedheavily in the event of war. Gen. Michael Dugan, the air forcechief of staff, was fired in September for revealing contingencyplans that involved bombing Baghdad.   The evacuation drill today was conducted for the half of Baghdadthat lies on the east bank of the Tigris River, but only about 1million of the 2 million residents participated, said residents,who spoke on condition of anonymity.   A second exercise Saturday will cover west Baghdad.   Basra, Iraq's second-largest city with a million people, wasevacuated in a similar exercise Thursday.   In Saudi Arabia, Cheney told troops that war was closer.   ``It increasingly looks like (Saddam's) not getting the messageand we'll have to use force,'' Cheney said. ``The only acceptableoutcome, if hostilities begin, is absolute, total victory.''   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, saidthat if an attack were lauched: ``We will launch it violently, wewill launch it in a way that will make it decisive so we canget itover as quickly as possible and there's no question who won.''   Bush met with members of Congress on Thursday and told them hebelieved Saddam was underestimating U.S. power and intentions,several legislators said.   Saddam must be made aware that ``if we get into an armedsituation, he's going to get his ass kicked,'' Rep. Elton Gallegly,R-Calif., quoted Bush as saying. Bush's remark was confirmed byanother person at the meeting.   A Pentagon spokesman said 10,000 more U.S. troops reached SaudiArabia this week, bringing the American force to 280,000. Thespokesman, Bob Hall, said U.S. intelligence sources put the Iraqiforce in and around Kuwait at 510,000.</TEXT></DOC>
