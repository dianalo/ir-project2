The Defense Department's position is bound to provokecontroversy on Capitol Hill, where there are many boosters ofhometown reserve units. Lawmakers are likely to complain thattens of billions of dollars will have been spent fruitlesslyover the years training and equipping the Army National Guardand reserves with the idea of having them jump quickly into acombat role if necessary.</LP><TEXT>   In a report to Congress, expected to be made public soon,the Pentagon has concluded that Army reserve combat unitsshouldn't be part of any fast-response, contingency forcesuch as Operation Desert Shield.   People familiar with the report said that it indicatesthat it takes too long to call up and train reserve brigadesfor them to be effective as front-line combat forces in suchquick-response operations. Some Army reserve combat unitsalready called to active duty, for example, are stilltraining and won't be ready to begin deploying to the Gulffor several more weeks.   Ordered by Congress more than a year ago and influenced bythe latest deployment to the Gulf, the report already hasprompted some complaints from commanders in the Gulf. Theycontend the findings violate the longstanding concept thatactive and reserve units should be interchangeable.   Pentagon and congressional aides familiar with thelong-awaited report, called the Total Force Policy Study,said it also envisions deep annual cuts in the Army's600,000-member guard and reserve forces totaling 25% over thenext five years. Lawmakers overwhelmingly rejected similarcuts proposed by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that wouldhave proportionately cut reserves as deeply as active forces.Instead, Congress voted to cut active forces more deeply anduse reserves to fill in many of the gaps.   So far, about 145,000 reservists have been activated as aresult of the current Gulf crisis, with the Army calling upwell over 100,000 of the total.   Army reservists have been assigned to everything fromtransportation, ammunition and medical units to publicaffairs offices and shops making eyeglasses. But the Army sofar hasn't assigned any reserve units to combat duty. At thesame time, the Air Force and Navy have called up more than40,000 reservists to various duties in the Gulf, includingpilots who are expected to lead some of the earliest bombingruns against Iraqi targets.   About 15,000 Army reservists have started a new round ofdesert warfare training in the U.S., and Mr. Cheney has saidhe might send them to the front in Saudi Arabia.   Col. Robert Grasso, who heads a special Army team in SaudiArabia studying reserve issues, said that the role ofreserves must change with the end of the Cold War. Now, hesaid, there is no longer ample time to prepare for a majormilitary buildup. &quot;Since Kuwait fell in five hours . . . wehave to take a look at restructuring the Army to cope&quot; withmuch shorter warning times.</TEXT></DOC>
