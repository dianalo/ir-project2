To identify components of the mixturethat were responsible for this effect, a high-boiling coal liquid wasseparated into aliphatic, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), nitrogen-containingpolycyclic aromatic compounds (NPAC) and oxygen-containing PAH fractions(HPAH); these were spiked with {sup 3}H-BaP and administered dermallyto mice, and DNA was isolated 24 hr later. The BaP binding, estimatedby radioactivity associated with DNA, decreased to 47, 55 and 66% ofthat for the same BaP dose administered alone for PAH, NPAC and HPAHfractions, respectively. In vitro studies with Aroclor-induced rat liverS9 showed that the rate of BaP metabolism decreased when BaP was coadministeredwith the mixtures. However, BaP metabolite profiles for BaP alone andin the presence of the mixture were similar. Differences in mutagenicand, presumably, carcinogenic activities of BaP administered with a complexmixture may reflect decreased rates of BaP conversion to reactive metabolites.</TEXT></DOC>
