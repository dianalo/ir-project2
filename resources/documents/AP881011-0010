Congress imposed the sanctions because of South Africa's policyof racial discrimination against its non-white majority, overridinga veto by President Reagan in the process.   The congressional General Accounting Office analyzed data forthe first nine months of 1987, and found that South Africa's majorexports to the United States declined by $417 million compared withthe same period the year before. The biggest losses were in ironand steel and uranium.   Twenty-three industrialized and newly industrializing countriesare major South African trading partners, but the others have nottaken up the slack, the GAO found.   ``South Africa has not been able to replace its former exportsto the United States of these commodities by redirecting trade tothe other 22 nations and has suffered further losses in exports tothese countries as well,'' said the report to Sens. Edward Kennedy,D-Mass., and Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., both of whom supported thesanctions.   The total loss in South African sales was put at $469 million.The report listed West Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and Hong Kongas making the deepest cuts after the United States. Theirreductions were considerably less than those of the United States,however. The biggest drop, just under $70 million, was in WestGerman purchases.   South African sales would have fallen even more had Taiwan notgone against the trend and increased its purchases by $164 million,the report said.   U.S. investments in South Africa also fell in 1987, the reportfound, although total U.S. investment is still up from the level of1984.   U.S. investments in South Africa increased nearly 10 percentfrom 1984 to 1986 _ from $2.04 billion to $2.23 billion _ beforedeclining in 1987, after sanctions were imposed, by about 5 percentto $2.12 billion.   ``Despite more than half of U.S. companies withdrawing since1984, the value of U.S. direct investments in South Africa ... hasincreased 4 percent,'' the report said. ``This increase is largelythe result of significant reinvested earnings.''   In 1987 American companies reinvested $94 million of theirprofits in South Africa. The sanctions law banned new investment.</TEXT></DOC>
