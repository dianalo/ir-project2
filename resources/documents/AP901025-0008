Fox News said some of the bodies may be buried in mass gravesnear Warrenton, Va., about 45 miles southwest of Washington.   Authorities were told of the abductions by Edward Allen See, aninmate in a Nevada prison, Fox said. See is serving a life sentencewithout possibility of parole for the murders of two women.   The network said See was ``having trouble identifying thespecific place'' of burial, and no one had yet searched for thebodies.   Justice Department spokesman Michael Robinson told TheAssociated Press he had no information about the report.   The network said See told the FBI a number of blacks werekidnapped at random from the streets of Washington.   See also has alleged the killings were done with the complicityof local law enforcement officials and politicians.   See has passed one lie detector test and is scheduled foranother next week, Fox said.   But his mother told authorities on one occasion he was ``a liarwho just wants attention.''</TEXT></DOC>
