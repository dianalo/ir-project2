A damsel in distress. &quot;I can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable than the situation in which I find myself,&quot; she says.    Once again, the game is afoot. Once again, PBS brings us new episodes in the splendid series &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (PBS, Thursdays, 9 p.m.). Starting this week and running through mid-December, this third season of master detection includes &quot;Silver Blaze,&quot; &quot;The Devil's Foot,&quot; and a two-part &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles.&quot;    The season opens with a classic, &quot;The Sign of Four&quot; (shown in two parts, Oct. 27 and Nov. 3). Only the second Holmes story that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote, it's a strange and exotic tale, set against the backdrop of British colonization of India.    Young Mary Morstan (Jenny Seagrove) arrives at 221B Baker Street and tells Holmes that her father, an officer in the Bombay Infantry, disappeared some 10 years earlier. For each of the past six years, she's been receiving a single magnificent pearl from an anonymous benefactor.    This year, she's also received a mysterious letter. &quot;You're a wronged woman, and shall be avenged,&quot; says the letter, which also asks for a rendezvous &quot;at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre tonight at seven o'clock.&quot;    And so Holmes and Watson are plunged into a tale bristling with vivid, offbeat characters -- a peculiar, hookah-smoking recluse, turbaned Sikhs, and a fierce, peglegged soldier bent on revenge.    With its richly drawn textures of Victorian England, &quot;The Sign of Four&quot; -- like all the episodes in this series -- is impeccably put together (dramatized by John Hawkesworth of &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; fame; produced by June Wyndham Davies). Horse-drawn carriages clatter over cobblestones on foggy London nights. Elegant manor houses sit on the moors, shrouded in mist.    But above all, you tune in to watch Jeremy Brett, as flashy as ever in his third season as the great detective. His Holmes is a virtuoso, temperamental and imperious. &quot;I draw your attention to the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime,&quot; he proclaims. &quot;But the dog did nothing in the nighttime,&quot; says an astounded listener. &quot;That,&quot; Holmes gives a curt nod, &quot;is the curious incident.&quot;    Tall and bony, Mr. Brett looks like Holmes should, with a lean, aquiline face, and an intense, hawklike gaze. He also has the gestures you might expect -- the finger to the lips, the furrowed brow.    But Mr. Brett has gone one step further to truly flesh his character out. Singleminded in the pursuit of clues, his Holmes walks into a room and throws his hat and coat in a heap on the floor. He is brilliant in a vaguely antisocial way, and his rapid-fire intelligence doesn't suffer fools, or interference, gladly. &quot;Mrs. Hudson,&quot; he tells his faithful housekeeper, &quot;you are hideously in the way. Please disappear.&quot;    Above all, it's Mr. Brett's subtle shadings that are wonderful. Holmes's smile, for instance, is a brief, ironic flicker that comes and goes as quickly as a summer storm. It's the smile of a man who has wit, but is too absorbed to indulge himself in humor.    And in one startling moment last season -- when Inspector Lestrade finally broke down and congratulated Holmes on solving a case -- Mr. Brett's face registered pleasure, scorn, bemusement and triumph all at once. Five seconds long, it was a bravura performance -- the kind of performance to convince you that, as unforgettable as Basil Rathbone was, Jeremy Brett is Sherlock Holmes. (He is, in fact, currently playing the sleuth on the London stage in &quot;The Secret of Sherlock Holmes.&quot;)    If there is a problem with this third season, it's that the stories have gotten a little slim. Some of them, like &quot;The Devil's Foot,&quot; are not Sir Arthur's best. Short on plot, they are forced to lean heavily on ambiance and characterization. Not that that's so terrible. The worst of these is more entertaining -- more sheer cozy fun for a cold fall evening -- than most of the network crime dramas.    But the best are very good indeed, and one in particular this season is great -- &quot;Wisteria Lodge&quot; (dramatized by Jeremy Paul), airing Dec. 1.    At the Baker Street flat, Holmes is moping: &quot;Life is commonplace. The audacity of man has passed from the world.&quot; Suddenly, a flustered, portly, middle-aged man shows up, bearing a strange tale. He was the weekend house guest at the manor home of an acquaintance. When he awoke, the lodge was empty -- his host and all the staff had disappeared.    Once again, Holmes is thrust into &quot;a most extraordinary and tragic affair,&quot; a baffling case of abduction and murder. But this time, there's an extra twist. The local constable, Inspector Baynes, turns out to be a worthy adversary for the detective -- round and beaming where Holmes is lean and intense. As played by Freddie Jones, Baynes is quite a character -- half jovial, half sinister, and shrewd as can be. Their intellectual duel is delicious.    As a series, this &quot;Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; is witty, lavish and just plain fun. In short, it's good television. Don't miss it. </TEXT></DOC>
