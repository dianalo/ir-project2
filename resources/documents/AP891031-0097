STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East German Communist Party chief Egon Krenzheaded to Moscow today to discuss reform proposals with thearchitect of perestroika, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   The official news agency ADN reported this afternoon that Krenzhad flown to the Soviet Union but it did not specify when hedeparted.   He was scheduled to meet with Gorbachev on Wednesday morning andhold a news conference in the afternoon before leaving the Sovietcapital, ADN said.   Krenz's first foreign trip East Germany's leader began after anight demonstrations in nine cities. About 500,000 East Germanstook to the streets to demand democratic reforms in the largestprotests in East Germany's 40-year history; about 300,000 peoplemarched through Leipzig.   East Germany's largest opposition group today sent a message ofsupport to human rights activists in Czechoslovakia.   The statement from the New Forum opposition group, which countsmore than 15,000 members, reflected the growing feeling thatKrenz's leadership is serious about loosening restrictions on freespeech.   ``We are convinced that new times will come to you, too, andthat the Prague Spring will finally have its Summer,'' New Forumsaid in a letter sent to Czechoslovak human rights activists. Theletter was made public in West Berlin.   Czechoslovakia began a sweeping program of liberal reforms underCommunist leader Alexander Dubcek, but the so-called ``PragueSpring'' was quashed by the Warsaw Pact invasion of August 1968.   The current Communist leadership in Prague has strongly rejectedthe need for reforms and has dealt harshly with dissent.   About 10,000 people demonstrated in Prague on Saturday for moredemocracy. Protesters were beaten by police and more than 300 werearrested.   Monday's protests in East Germany took place in Leipzig, Halle,Schwerin, Karl-Marx-Stadt, Cottbus, Magdeburg, Dresden, Poessneckand East Berlin, according to the state-run news agency ADN.   Activists said marchers demanded that the Communist Partyrelinquish its monopoly on power. Witnesses also said theprotesters carried signs demanding free elections and thelegalization of opposition groups.   There were no reports of violence or arrests.   The protests of recent weeks followed an exodus of East Germansto the West. Since August, nearly 70,000 _ many of them youngskilled workers _ have fled to the West.   Krenz replaced hard-liner Erich Honecker on Oct. 18 and thegovernment has launched an unparalleled campaign of dialogue andopenness aimed at winning public trust.   In a speech to military academy graduates Monday, Krenzreiterated his belief in the Communist Party's leading role insociety.   He said the party was ``at the head of qualitative changes goingon in society.''   Krenz has promised changes including freer travel to the Westand amnesty for people jailed for trying to escape thetightly-controlled society and for those who have succeeded.   He has also declared that East Germany has much to learn fromreforms in the Soviet Union, a major reversal from Honecker'scontention that such changes were unnecessary.   A leader of East Germany's Communist-allied Liberal DemocraticParty charged Monday that the country's ``political structure nolonger corresponds to the will of the people.''   Manfred Bogisch suggested in a commentary in his party'snewspaper, Der Morgen, that the Communists' leading role would haveto be won, not dictated.   Although Bogisch said socialism was not at issue in the reformdiscussion, he said the Communist leadership's policies are `now amatter of debate.''   Under East Germany's constitution, all recognized politicalparties are allied with the Communists. However, the LiberalDemocrats have said the other parties should have more independence.   Also Monday, leaders of the country's government-aligned tradeunion federation met to discuss a confidence vote called by theunion's leader.   Union head Harry Tisch, who also sits on the ruling Politburo,asked for the vote on his leadership after many young memberscharged the union served only the interests of the government,neglecting workers' needs.   The official ADN news agency said a final decision on Tisch'svote had been postponed until Nov. 17, when the union leadershipplans to meet again.   The agency reported that some members had already withdrawntheir support for Tisch but that the majority still backed him.   In a statement carried by ADN late Monday, the trade unionleadership said the nation's Communist system faced ``seriousdanger.''   However, it said it was partly to blame for letting problemspile up and pledged to better represent the interests of workers inthe future.</TEXT></DOC>
