The earthquakes, the stronger of which registered 7.3 on the Richter scale, jolted Ecuador and parts of Colombia late Thursday night. The quakes, with epicenters in the Andes about 70 miles northeast of Quito, also damaged natural gas pipelines. Ecuador's president, Leon Febres Cordero, declared a state of emergency in three provinces, where thousands were left homeless.    &quot;We are not exporting one drop of oil as of today,&quot; Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador's deputy oil minister, told the AP-Dow Jones News Service Friday. He said exports aren't expected to resume until April at the earliest.    Analysts said Ecuador had been exporting about 235,000 barrels of oil a day, slightly above its quota of 210,000 barrels assigned by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    The nation's suspension of exports contributed to a price rally Friday that led oil above $18 a barrel for the first time in a month. Crude oil contracts for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange surged 38 cents a barrel, to $18.13. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures prices also rose.    On the non-contract market, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 40 cents, to $18.15, and March North Sea Brent, an abundantly traded European blend, climbed 35 cents, to $17.55 a barrel.    Separately, landslides over the weekend have cracked the Iraqi crude-oil pipeline that runs through Turkey. Oil industry officials weren't able to confirm whether oil shipments along the 600-mile line have been halted. </TEXT></DOC>
