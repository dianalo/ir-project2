The Environmental Protection Agency said that results midway through a lab study show the chemical caused lung tumors in male and female mice at low, medium and high doses.    The chemical, made by Avery Inc.'s Uniroyal Chemical Co. unit under the trade name Alar, mostly has been used to keep apples from falling off trees before the fruit can be picked. Most growers stopped using it voluntarily in 1986 after health concerns were raised, but the EPA hasn't had enough evidence to ban or severely restrict its use.    The EPA said that while tumors were found in mice, they haven't so far been found in rats midway through a two-year study. Thus, the evidence is too preliminary to determine daminozide's cancer-causing potential or to take regulatory action yet against the chemical, the EPA's pesticides chief, John Moore, said in a letter to the International Apple Institute.    But because tumors developed in one species of animal, &quot;we could classify it as a possible human carcinogen,&quot; an EPA spokesman said. &quot;The evidence right now isn't strong enough to have us remove this from the marketplace,&quot; he said. &quot;The tests just aren't finished. But it certainly confirms that our concerns aren't completely unfounded.&quot;    Spokesmen for Uniroyal Chemical couldn't be reached for comment. The EPA spokesman said the Middlebury, Conn.-based company contends the tumors in the mice were benign. However, the EPA routinely considers any tumors potentially carcinogenic.    A second battery of tests, on a byproduct of the chemical, also caused lung tumors in mice in one study, the agency said. But at a lower dose in another continuing study, the byproduct hasn't caused tumors in rats or mice.    Earlier studies found the chemical or its byproduct caused cancer in laboratory animals, and the EPA in 1984 considered banning it. But its independent Science Advisory Panel said the studies were flawed, so the agency began a new review and ordered new tests.    The EPA could decide whether to restrict or ban daminozide as early as this fall, according to Mr. Moore's letter.    More than one-third of apples produced in the U.S. used to be treated with the growth-regulating chemical, which less frequently is used on such crops as peanuts, cherries, peaches and pears. In 1985 and 1986, grocery stores and companies making apple juice and apple sauce stopped accepting apples sprayed with Alar.    Derl Derr, executive vice president of the International Apple Institute, said the industry already has &quot;substantially cut back&quot; on use of the chemical since 1986. The preliminary test results &quot;aren't going to make a major difference in practices at the moment, though (they) may indicate that long-range this chemical might not be available,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
