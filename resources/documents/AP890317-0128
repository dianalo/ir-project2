Bush, speaking with reporters on Air Force One as he flew herefrom Colorado, said that the national debate over assault weaponslike the AK-47 had gotten ``a little bit' too hot.   ``We'll make our decisions in a cool way. ... We won't be swayedby the temper of the debate,'' he said.   Bush said that the decision to limit imports of five models ofsemiautomatic weapons ``represents a heightened concern on my partabout AK-47s'' but that he is not prepared at this point to movebeyond that action.   ``We have to find an accommodation between the police and thesporting interests,'' Bush said.   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms said the government may ban imports of additional kinds ofsemiautomatic weapons.   The bureau is still reviewing the uses of all types of importedsemiautomatics but has not reached a decision on whether to suspendimportation of more models than the five types banned from importthis week, said Jerry Rudden, a spokesman for the agency.   ``The process is ongoing. Additional firearms may very well beadded to the list. ... Large numbers of firearms are being lookedat,'' he said.   National Rifle Association lobbyist Wayne LaPierre met withBush's chief of staff, John Sununu, on Thursday. But an aide toSununu said LaPierre did not push to block an expansion of the banto more weapons models.   Asked if the import ban _ which does not affect sale of U.S.-madeweapons _ was a change of position on gun control, Bush held hishand up to his wrist and said: ``It's a pulse change.''   He voiced support for the decision this week of a U.S. firearmsmanufacturer, Colt, to impose voluntary restraints on its productionof semiautomatic weapons.   ``I'm certainly not going to differ with that decision,'' he said.   Bush said he could understand the emotionally charged nature ofthe debate on guns. ``I can understand when kids are shot down bysemiautomatic weapons, I can certainly understand the publicoutcry.''   When asked whether he was looking at further steps, Bush said:``Well, we'll let you know.''   Bush also said:   _That ``no decision has been made'' on a proposed joint venturewith the Japanese for production in Japan of a new version of theF-16 jet fighter. He sought to play down earlier suggestions that abasic commitment had been made to the project, with only detailsremaining to be worked out.   _He was saddened that hostage Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, was beginning his fifth yearof captivity in Lebanon, but said that wouldn't lead to any changeor reformulation in U.S. policy on hostages. The fact that Andersonand others remain held against their will ``is with me every singlewaking hour,'' Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
