SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Navy has put off until early August thesecond submarine launch test of its newest and most powerful nuclearweapon, the Trident 2 missile, Pentagon officials said Thursday.   The first such test ended in failure on March 21, when themissile self-destructed four seconds after it was launched by thesubmarine USS Tennessee off the coast of Cape Canaveral.   Although a second test had been anticipated for mid-July,Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams announced that the Navy's analysisof tests involving the missile's rebuilt nozzle control system wouldnot be completed in time to meet such a schedule.   Therefore, the test has been rescheduled for early August,Williams said.   The delay will not affect the Navy's plans to meet its deadlinefor putting the submarine missile in full operation by March 1990,the spokesman said.   In the first attempt to launch the missile from the submergedTennessee, the weapon popped to the surface as planned and the firststage ignited properly, but the missile then began spinning like aburning pinwheel and exploded.   Afterwards, Pentagon officials said they suspected a mechanicalfault in the part of the missile that swivels the rocket nozzlesfrom side to side, thereby directing the missile's angle of flight.   The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weaponthat is the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent, the Trident1. The new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads toindividual targets up to 4,600 miles away.   The Trident 1 experienced some test failures but was deployed onschedule, Pentagon officials said after the Trident 2's first testfailure.   The Navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than itsundersea predecessors _ Polaris, Poseidon and Trident 1 _ and canmatch the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it islaunched from a submerged, moving submarine.   The Tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry24 of the missiles.   Navy spokeswoman Lt. Janet Mescus said in May that analysis ofdata and parts recovered from the failed test indicated the missilewent out of control for two reasons.   One problem originated in the mechanical link that transmitsdirection commands to the first stage exhaust nozzle, which pivotsto control the missile's direction. The second involved the timingand degree of the nozzle position commands as pressure was buildingin the motor early in the missile's flight.   ``Instead of commands directing the missile to go up and out, itwent up and over,'' Mescus said.   The missile, also known as the D-5, is built by the LockheedMissiles andamp; Space Co. and costs $26.5 million each.</TEXT></DOC>
