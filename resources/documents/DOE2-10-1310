Itdescribes the selection of test items meeting the DOE requirements andthe methods by which they were used to test the metal detector. It providesa collection of data generated by detection sensitivity tests, electricaland radio frequency interference tests, and walk tests performed underlaboratory conditions. Test results are included in both raw and graphicform. A synoptic discussion of the tests includes an analysis of theresults and conjecture on their impact on field applications. Pertinentinformation is presented regarding the use of standard test articles.The results of the testing indicate that the metal detection performanceof the Astrophysics Mark 100 AT exceeds the literal DOE requirements,but that it has some characteristics which may limit its applicationat nuclear installations. For example, all the test weapons could easilybe detected, but not on any single one of the four factory metal detectionprograms tested. All shielding test articles could be detected on a singleprogram, but required high sensitivity settings that caused excessivenuisance alarms. However, under special unspecified applications themetal detection performance may be acceptable, even exemplary. It hasdetection attributes that make it particularly well suited for selectivelydetecting items of aluminum, mild steel, and austenitic and ferriticstainless steel materials.</TEXT></DOC>
