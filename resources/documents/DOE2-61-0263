<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-61-0263 </DOCNO><TEXT>This bibliography contains citations concerning the radiation crosslinkingof thermoplastic and thermosetting plastics and elastomers. Energy efficiencyand performance of polymer curing by such radiation as ultraviolet, microwave,and infrared wavelengths are discussed relative to such materials aspolymeric coatings, adhesives, elastomers, and epoxy resins. Hazardsof radiation curing of polymers as well as applications of the electron-processedplastics are included. (This updated bibliography contains 176 citations,62 of which are new entries to the previous edition.)</TEXT></DOC>
