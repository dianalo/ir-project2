The five firms, Salomon Brothers Inc., a unit of Salomon Inc., Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., PaineWebber Inc., a unit of Paine Webber Group Inc., Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., a unit of General Electric Co., and Bear Stearns andamp; Co., said that for the time being they have stopped doing so-called index arbitrage for their own accounts, the most common form of program trading. With yesterday's announcement, all major Wall Street firms have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts, industry officials said.    In index arbitrage trading, traders, assisted by computers, buy or sell baskets of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from brief price discrepancies. Many big investors and securities industry officials have charged that program trading has been a major cause of stock-market volatility in the wake of the last October's crash.    Traders and portfolio managers reacted favorably to the firms' announcements, although the statements had no visible effect on the market's activity yesterday. The managers and traders added that the move won't solve the stock market's volatility problems. &quot;If people thought (proprietary index arbitrage) was the main problem, that's being a little shortsighted,&quot; said Nick Minucci, a trader at First Boston Corp. &quot;There's still a big universe out there who are doing index arbitrage&quot; for customer accounts, including some big money managers.    In Washington, where program trading has been a central issue in the debate over post-crash reforms, the firms' announcements received mixed reviews. Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House finance subcommittee, which held hearings on program trading last week, greeted the firms' move as possibly &quot;some of the best news the markets have had since the October crash.&quot;    But Securities and Exchange Commissioner Joseph Grundfest said, &quot;This isn't in and of itself going to fix the market's problems. Index arbitrage isn't the problem. It is the mechanism by which, in part, the problems express themselves. The odds are (the withdrawals) will make the markets worse.&quot;    Officials at three of the firms, Morgan Stanley, Salomon and PaineWebber, whose announcements occurred within a few minutes of each other, said their moves had been coordinated. Trading executives at the three firms had held several informal conversations beginning last week and ending on Monday, when it was decided that the announcements should be made yesterday morning. A trader for Kidder said his firm hadn't been consulted.    &quot;There has been a loss of confidence in the markets,&quot; said PaineWebber Chairman Donald B. Marron, explaining why his firm had decided to take this step. Mr. Marron said his firm had received complaints mostly from individual investors.    But executives of the other firms said pressure had increased sharply last week from big institutional traders that don't do program trading. Moreover, corporate clients were growing increasingly uncomfortable with what they saw as program trading's creation of volatility and uncertainty in their stock prices.    Industry officials also said that the New York Stock Exchange had been working behind the scenes to pressure the firms that were still doing proprietary index arbitrage trading.    Nonetheless, some players contend that the pullout may create even more violent stock price swings. &quot;It's going to increase the volatility,&quot; said a futures trader for one of the firms that announced its withdrawal. &quot;You'll see a serious day, and you'll see a de-linking of the (stock and futures) markets. The only reason you want the markets linked is to bring more capital to the pie. This limits the sources of capital.&quot;    Jack R. Meyer, chief investment officer for the Rockefeller Foundation, said, &quot;Index arbitrage is a stabilizing force for the market. It really by definition is price neutral.&quot; He expects the foundation to boost its use of index arbitrage now that there are fewer players to close the spreads between the stock and futures indexes. &quot;It will likely increase our opportunities, and we would plan to take advantage of those opportunities,&quot; he said.    But Robert Kirby, a longtime critic of the practice and chairman of Capital Guardian Trust Co., a Los Angeles money manager, said the announcements are &quot;a big step toward lifting the suspicion&quot; that firms are trading for their own accounts before placing customer orders. &quot;I'm pleased but certainly not gloating,&quot; he said, adding that the large customers will still use the computerized strategy.    The biggest institutional players who engage in index arbitrage, including Wells Fargo Investment Advisors, Bankers Trust Co. and Mellon Capital Management, structure their portfolios to match such indexes as the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.    Rick Nelson, the head of passive management at Bankers Trust Co., called the announcements &quot;unfortunate,&quot; and contends that the long-term effect may be to make the U.S. securities markets less competitive with other markets.    &quot;People are going to see a lot of liquidity drying up,&quot; he argued. &quot;I think this will exacerbate the volume and liquidity problems by taking away a natural trade. Some bad precedents are being set.&quot;    Mr. Nelson estimates that roughly $4 billion to $5 billion of pension money is available for index arbitrage. Bankers Trust typically has less than $1 billion available for the strategy, he said.    Other major Wall Street firms, including Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., suspended index arbitrage trading for their own accounts as early as January in reaction to client pressure.    One of the five firms that announced a suspension yesterday, Bear Stearns, said it also stopped executing such program trades for customers. Many industry officials insist that the majority of program trades executed since the October market crash has been for customers, such as large pension funds and money managers.    Bear Stearns Chairman Alan Greenberg yesterday criticized the moves of the other firms as not going far enough. &quot;If you stop doing it for yourself, but still do it for customers, it's a joke,&quot; he said. But officials at the other firms argued that a suspension of all index arbitrage business would be impractical unless the practice was banned by regulators.    Some of the firms making announcements yesterday attempted to play down the importance of program trading to their profitability.    Salomon, for example, said revenue from proprietary stock index arbitrage accounted for only $2.5 million of Salomon's $1.61 billion in revenue for the first quarter. The average amount of capital the firm used in such trading was only $75 million, it said. However, Stanley Shopkorn, a Salomon vice chairman, declined to say how much revenue Salomon makes from executing program trades for clients.    Morgan Stanley said its own proprietary index arbitrage operation generated only about one half of 1% of the firm's $975.4 million in first-quarter revenue. A senior Morgan official said that index arbitrage executed for customer accounts netted the firm a roughly equal amount of revenue. The firm earned $98.6 million, or $3.82 a share, in the quarter.    Bear Stearns's Mr. Greenberg, who has been one of program trading's staunchest public supporters, asserted that &quot;there's no money in it&quot; recently because the thin trading volume in both stocks and stock index futures prevents program traders from executing large trades.    ---   Thomas E.
