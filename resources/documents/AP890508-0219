That's new.''   He said the U.S. Commerce Department recently granted exportlicenses to Austria for three apparently unrelated components, noneseen as sensitive on its own. Together, they allowed the Soviets tomake advanced fiber optics.   ``All they needed was a little piece of software to make it allhum, but Commerce did not see the overall context,'' the Pentagonofficial said.   CIA estimates say the Soviet Military Industrial Commissionobtained 30,000 pieces of hardware and 400,000 technical documentsbetween 1976 and 1980.   In the early 1980s, the Reagan administration pressed its alliesto clamp down, but Gorbachev came along in 1985 with his talk ofpeace and reform.   Waldegrave, the British deputy foreign secretary, said: ``Wemust not let Gorbeuphoria sweep away our defenses.''   West Germany, which borders the Soviet bloc and depends heavilyon export earnings, argues energetically for cooperation and moreselective controls.   ``We don't want to have a new artificial division between Eastand West,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hanns Schumacher said.   Officials in the United States, Britain and France said theyworried about West Germany's ability, and will, to controlsensitive exports.   A U.S. Defense Department document made available to TheAssociated Press identifies West Germany as ``the greatest singlesource of illegal transfers of sensitive technology.''   After West German sales of chemical weapons components to Libyaand the Middle East were criticized, Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sgovernment agreed to crack down on sensitive exports.   Enforcement officers remained skeptical. German companies cansue officials for delaying goods and no pre-license orpost-delivery checks guard against fraud. Investigators havelimited access to company records.   ``There are 20 cases where the Germans are pretending nothing isgoing on,'' said Perle, the former U.S. defense official.   ``We pleaded with them, but they have not put in place amechanism for enforcement. They let the companies go out and sell.''   Differences in philosophy divide even close allies.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain recently allowed thecompany Simon Carves to sell electronic machining equipment worth$450 million to a factory in Soviet Armenia despite U.S. objections.   Britain said nothing new was given away and the deal warmed theEast-West climate. U.S. officials argued against helping with suchcomplex projects.   Technology theft made headlines when Toshiba Machine of Japanand Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk of Norway were caught faking documentsto sell the Soviets milling equipment to produce silent submarinepropellers.   The case broke in 1985, but one Pentagon specialist said thefull effects would not be known until the mid-1990s. Westernengineers had to design better noise-detecting devices.   Japan tightened controls, but subsequent probes found similarviolations in France, West Germany and Italy. Americans and Britonswere involved in other cases.   Punishment is seldom harsh for diverting technology, andinvestigators complain that governments sometimes mask details toavoid scandal.   Bryen, the former U.S. trade security official, likened the morerecent Forest-Line case in France to Toshiba-Kongsberg because itallowed the Soviets to machine sophisticated aircraft wings.   Last April, four executives of the Forest-Line company werecharged with smuggling machine tools to the Soviet Union.   They were released pending trial. The Paris daily Liberationreported much later that a fifth man, a government consultant, wasalso under investigation.   A French official confirmed a fifth suspect who worked for thegovernment, then shrugged and said: ``True, we didn't exactly shoutit from the rooftops.''   From a U.S. Embassy annex in Paris, CoCom's small staff protectsa list of components and processes the size of a city telephonebook. A separate U.S. list controls items for reasons of securityor foreign policy.   The agency was not established by treaty and depends on the willof governments to apply national laws or priorities. Some Europeansaccuse CoCom of needlessly limiting their markets.   Many say the list is outdated and too long. As a Dutch delegateput it, CoCom needs ``a higher wall around a smaller garden.''   U.S. officials fear sensitive technology will move uncheckedtoward the easiest exit when the European Economic Community lowersinternal customs barriers in 1993.   In Washington, the Defense and Commerce departments argue overwhat to deny the Soviet Union and how much to sacrifice in exportearnings.   Under ``foreign availability,'' an exporter can sell arestricted item if he demonstrates someone else already is doingit. Officials say that invites abuse.   Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary of commerce for exportadministration, agreed with others that controls at best could slowan inevitable process, stopping big diversions while smaller onespassed unnoticed.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 14</NOTE></DOC>
