Now itmust launch a profitable business.   Pegasus, the first U.S.-developed launch vehicle since thespace shuttle, is designed to carry small satellites intospace. The crewless rocket, outfitted with a distinctivetriangular wing, is launched from a B-52 bomber to eliminatethe need for a costly ground booster.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, at 12:10 PDT, the rocket worked just as itsyouthful inventors hoped it would. The B-52 dropped thePegasus booster over the Pacific Ocean; it fell for fiveheart-stopping seconds; then it ignited. A camera in a jettrailing the B-52 televised the rocket's fiery ascent intospace. &quot;I got my view of Pegasus really climbing fast,&quot; saidthe B-52 pilot, Gordon Fullerton. &quot;It looked like a shuttleheading for the sky.&quot;   The launch's success was a big boost for privately heldOrbital Sciences Corp., which developed the rocket, and forspace entrepreneurship generally. Most immediately, it clearsthe way for Orbital Sciences to complete its initial publicstock offering and raise a much-needed $16.3 million, beforeunderwriting fees. The offering was postponed last week aftera Wall Street Journal article appeared describing the risk ofthe launch.   Even more important, the launch enhances the credibilityof the Fairfax, Va., company, which had been promotingPegasus for several years but had run into a host oftechnical problems in building the rocket. &quot;The first launchrepresents the ultimate proof of concept -- of design,analysis and testing,&quot; said Orbital Sciences Chairman DavidThompson. &quot;It's a very important milestone.&quot;   The launch also was a milestone for aerospace technology.No winged vehicle ever accelerated to eight times the speedof sound, as Pegasus did. The computer models that OrbitalSciences used to make the rocket will now be utilized by theNational Aerospace and Space Administration to design itsproposed X-30 jet, which would take off from an airport andvault into space.   The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Agency bought thefirst three Pegasus rockets and ran yesterday's launch,indicating the military's keen interest in Pegasus.Air-launched rockets can be used to put up smallreconnaissance and communications satellites quickly overout-of-the way trouble spots. Indeed, one of the two smallobjects Pegasus put into orbit yesterday was a Navycommunications satellite that could be useful for spies.   &quot;Pegasus offers a capability we haven't had before,&quot; saidJerry Grey, vice president of technology for the AmericanInstitute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. &quot;You can launchfrom anywhere into any orbit.&quot;   But Orbital Sciences may have a tough time exploiting thatadvantage because of competition and price pressures. NASAplans to choose a company later this year to build thatagency a small launcher of its own and may be hesitant to usea Pegasus-based vehicle for fear of relying too much on asingle launcher. Meanwhile, commercial customers demand lowprices, but the cost of Pegasus may be going up.   Orbital Sciences charges the Pentagon research agencyabout $6.5 million for each Pegasus -- about half the goingrate for small launchers. But Orbital Sciences has said itwill raise that price to about $8 million to launchcommercial satellites, and may have to raise it even moreonce it starts renting its own plane instead of using theNASA B-52.   The rocket company also will be under pressure to raiseprices to boost profit. So far, the company has had losses ofabout $46.5 million since its founding in 1982. In the ninemonths ended last Sept. 30, the latest period for which ithas filed financial data, Orbital Sciences had a loss of $5.4million on revenue of $56.8 million.</TEXT></DOC>
