Hastings' request that the full Senateconduct evidence hearings in his impeachment trial.   Instead, the committee called for a panel of 12 lawmakers toconduct hearings that would be televised so senators could watch ifthey chose.   ``There will be no question about the fairness of it,'' RulesCommittee Chairman Wendell Ford, D-Ky., said as his panel approved,9-0, a plan under which Senate leaders would name six Republican andsix Democratic lawmakers to hear evidence.   The 52-year-old Florida jurist is accused of plotting to get a$150,000 payoff.   Under the committee's plan, which is expected to be approved bythe Senate, the full Senate would first hold hearings on Hastings'motions to dismiss the charges against him.   Then the 12-senator panel would convene to hear perhaps six weeksof evidence concerning Hastings, who is the first black officialever to be impeached. He is also the first black U.S. District judgein Florida.   The House approved 413-3 on Aug. 8 a bill of impeachment allegingthat the U.S. District Court judge conspired with a Washingtonattorney to obtain money from two convicted racketeers in exchangefor a guarantee they would not serve time.   It also accuses him of making false statements at the 1983 trialin which a federal jury acquitted him of conspiracy in that case.   The bill of impeachment also accuses Hastings of disclosinginformation obtained by the government from a wiretap. It says hisaction wrecked a federal criminal investigation.   Impeached by the House, Hastings now faces the second step in theprocess, trial by the Senate. If convicted by the full Senate, hewill be removed from his $89,500 post on the bench. House membersact as prosecutors, and there is no appeal from the Senate'sdecision.   Hastings, who was not on hand for the Rules Committee session,says he is innocent. He wasn't in his chambers Thursday in Miami andcouldn't be reached immediately for comment on the ruling.   He has been saying that all of the senators who will vote on thecharges should hear the evidence in person and see the demeanor ofthe witnesses, not merely read a committee transcript.   Lawmakers, however, have been wary about tying up the Senatefloor for six weeks or more. Shunting such sessions into a committeeis a procedure devised in the 1930s after a painfully longimpeachment trial.   ``We have other constitutional responsibilities,'' Ford said.   The procedure was not used until 1986 when impeached DistrictJudge Harry E. Claiborne of Las Vegas sought in vain to hang ontohis black robe, even though he already was serving a prison sentencefor tax evasion.   In the current case, the Rules Committee left it up to thespecial 12-member panel to decide if the television signals from theevidence hearings would be sent by closed circuit only to senators'offices or made available to the public. The Claiborne trial wasbroadcast nationwide by the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network(C-SPAN).   The evidence hearings also will be videotaped for viewing bysenators in their offices.   ``The video will give us an opportunity to accommodate JudgeHastings in his request that we watch the demeanor of thewitnesses,'' Ford said.   Before the evidence phase of the trial gets under way, perhaps inMarch, the Senate must first act on motions by Hastings and hisattorney, Terence J. Anderson, to dismiss the counts against him.   Ford said he thought such matters could be cleared up within 30days.   Anderson, a University of Miami law professor, said he thoughtthe scheduling of motions was ``sensible'' and represents ``somerecognition of the seriousness of the issues.''   Anderson repeated his argument that leaving the case to a panelwas unconstitutional, although he said it could prove beneficial toHastings.   ``The argument is at least you'll have the full attention of 12senators instead of people wandering in and out. But I'm not surethat's constitutional,'' he said. ``Judge Hastings is not fightingjust to keep a job; he's fought to vindicate constitutionalprinciple.''</TEXT></DOC>
