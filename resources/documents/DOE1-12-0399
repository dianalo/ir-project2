<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-12-0399 </DOCNO><TEXT>A spectrometer based on an air-core, superconducting solenoid has beenconstructed, tested, and demonstrated to be useful as a heavy-ion reaction-productcollection and detection device. Two detector systems which measure ionenergy loss, residual energy, time-of-flight, and position in the detectorplane have been developed for use with the spectrometer. This spectrometeris the first which uses an air-core rather than a steel-yoked magnet.The characteristics of the two different designs are compared. The spectrometer'scylindrical symmetry, focusing properties, and large solid angle makeit well-suited for several different types of experiments, includingreactions with low cross sections and experiments requiring detectionof reaction products emitted at small angles to the beam. The opticalproperties of the spectrometer were determined using alpha-particle sourcesand elastically scattered particles from an accelerator beam. Simplefirst-order and ray-tracing calculations are shown to reproduce wellthe measured effects. The spectrometer was then used in the study of{sup 18}O-induced transfer reactions on neutron-rich targets, which resultedin the measurement of the masses of {sup 30}Mg, {sup 108}Ru, and {sup109}Rh.</TEXT></DOC>
