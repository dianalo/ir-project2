The producer of non-ferrous metals said the unit sold its interest to a company formed by Jean Dupere, chairman of LAB Chrysotile Inc., the limited partnership's general partner. Asarco said the purchase was made for $11.7 million in cash and notes.    Asarco said the sale will result in an after-tax charge of about $12 million against Asarco's third-quarter earnings. Asarco declined to forecast third-quarter earnings; in the year-ago quarter, the company earned $46.2 million, or $1.10 a share, on sales of $499.4 million.    Asarco said its unit ended its direct involvement in asbestos mining in July 1986, when it contributed its asbestos operations to a limited partnership formed by the owners of other asbestos-mining operations in the vicinity of Thetford Mines, Quebec. The sale of the one-third interest in the limited partnership has ended the company's investment in asbestos mining. </TEXT></DOC>
