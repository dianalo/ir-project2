FEVURLY</BYLINE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In today's consumer-oriented society, most peoplehave possessions and, in some form or another, many people haveplans to pass their wealth to their children or other youngrelatives.   Whether at the prompting of a financial adviser to get some taxsavings by shifting income to another person or solely out ofgenerosity, many people begin transferring their property duringtheir lifetimes.   However, when the recipient is legally a minor, a problemarises: State property laws restrict minors from possessing,owning, managing, selling or transferring property. In addition,third parties often assume a greater risk dealing with minorsbecause children may disaffirm or renounce any contract they haveentered.   The solution to these complications can take many forms: trustarrangements, court-appointed guardianships or custodianships, andeven state-authorized means of transfer.   All states have special laws that make it easier and legallysafer to make a gift to a minor. These laws primarily take twoforms: the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, which has been adopted inalmost all states, or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, which atlast count was in place in 34 states.   UGMA, which has been in effect since 1956, provides that anadult donor may make a gift of securities, money or a lifeinsurance product to a minor by having it registered in the nameof, and delivering it to, an adult (either the donor or anotheradult) or institution to hold as custodian for the minor.   UTMA, a creation of the Uniform Law commissioners in 1983, ismuch broader in its scope; it allows any kind of property _ real orpersonal, tangible or intangible _ to be given as a custodial giftand, unlike UGMA, also applies to such property transactions asrepayments of loans borrowed from minors and tranfers of propertyfrom trusts, guardianships or estates.   Under both forms, the minor acquires legal title to the propertygifted; the adult relinquishes all title.   Under either act, after a gift is made, custodians generallymaintain the same powers over the transferred property thatunmarried adult owners already have. The custodian may invest,manage or dispose of the gifted property on the minor's behalf, forany purpose whatsoever, short of using the income from one propertyto fulfill a legal obligation of support toward the child.   When income produced by a custodial gift relieves an individual,such as a parent, of a legal obligation to feed and clothe a child,the law taxes that income to such an individual.   Of course, grandparents or other family member donors, unlessthey also have been appointed the child's legal guardian, need notbe concerned with this problem.   Both acts provide for turning over the custodial property afterthe child reaches a specified age. The UGMA legislation originallyestablished the time of the distribution as age 21; however, inmany states, this has been reduced, typically to 18. In somestates, the age at which the child is entitled to receive theproperty can be extended by the donor, but in no event beyond age21.   UTMA sets the age for distribution of gifted property at age 21,and at 18 or other state-specified age for property other than agift. One should consult individual state law regarding what ageapplies.   Overall, UGMA and UTMA transfers provide a simple, inexpensivemeans to a desirable end. Both allow an adult to make a substantialgift of property to a child without the child having to assumecontrol of the property while still a minor. In addition, theparent or other relative may continue to monitor or manage thegrowth of the transferred property while achieving his or ownpersonal financial planning goals.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Keith Fevurly is an academic associate of theCollege for Financial Planning and an expert in estate and taxplanning.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thurs, May 31</NOTE></DOC>
