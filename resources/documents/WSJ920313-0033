The dispute stems from a 1988 action by American, a unitof Fort Worth, Texas's AMR Corp., when the carrier reducedthe number of seats available to frequent fliers and blackedout certain travel dates. A group of the frequent fliersclaimed American breached its contract with them and violatedthe Illinois consumer fraud law.</LP><TEXT>   American claimed state courts shouldn't even hear thedispute because federal law and the U.S. Constitutionpre-empt state regulation of fares, service or routes. Thecourt agreed with American partly, saying that the carriercouldn't be barred from implementing new rules for itsfrequent flier program. But the court said damage claims forconsumer fraud and breach of contract weren't covered byfederal law. &quot;These claims bear only a tangential relation to{American's} rates and services and are not expresslypre-empted,&quot; the court said in its opinion.   The case will go back to a lower state court to be triedon its merits. A spokesman for American said the carrier isstill studying its options for appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
