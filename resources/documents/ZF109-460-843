 It then signed a deal for theneeded space at a fair market price, bringing the occupancy rate up to 99%.andO;American Software president and CEO James Edenfield explained that a fullyoccupied office building is worth a lot more than a building two-thirds full.andM;After finding a buyer for the now more valuable building, Edenfield executedwhat is known as a &quot;three-room transaction,&quot; where he signed the purchasepapers, went next door to sell the building and finished up in a third room20 minutes later with a profit of $2.5 million to add to what is now a $58million pool of cash and marketable securities.andM;That deal is one example of the sound management that has allowed the20-year-old company, whose specialty is materials management software, torecord a compound annual growth rate of about 30% since the early 1980s,analysts said.andP;  Publicly held, American Software recorded revenue in 1990 of$91 million, with $19 million in earnings.andP;  Its consistent and conservativemanagement in an era of frequent mergers and acquisitions has beennoteworthy, according to observers.andM;STABILITY AN ADVANTAGEandM;Jay Vleeschhouwer, a securities analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., New Yorksaid, &quot;[American Software] stands out as being a very stable company comparedto its competitors who have been acquired or absorbed into other companies.&quot;andO;He said the real estate deal &quot;reflects a pretty sharp financial managementteam.andP;  They know a good deal when they see one.&quot;andM;He noted that given the strategic importance of mainframe software systems atthe core of a customer's business, financial stability and a clear directionis highly important.andP;  A number of American Software products compete withthose of Management Science America (MSA) and McCormack andamp; Dodge, whichearlier this year merged to become Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software, headquarteredin Atlanta.andP;  A 9% workforce layoff followed the merger.andM;Both Edenfield, the former president of MSA, and Thomas Newberry, formerchairman of MSA, left the company in 1970 to found American Software.andO;Newberry is now chairman of American Software.andP;  Edenfield agreed that the Dandamp;Bmerger would help his company.andM;&quot;The changes thus far have been constructive for us,&quot; Edenfield said.andO;&quot;Whenever there is confusion in the mind of the customer and there is someturnover of personnel, others benefit.andP;  I'm not sure how long it willcontinue, but we probably haven't reached the point of maximum benefit,&quot; hesaid, noting that American Software has also hired a number of workers laidoff at MSA's Atlanta headquarters.andM;A management information director at a manufacturing company, who asked notto be named, said he purchased American Software's distribution requirementsplanning package for his company prior to the Dandamp;B merger and breathed a sighof relief when he read of the merger.andP;  &quot;If I had known about it [the merger]at the time, it definitely would have become part of our purchase decision.andO;When I heard about it several months later, I said to myself, 'There's onedecision I won't have to lose any sleep over.'&quot;andM;American Software vice president and chief financial officer MichaelKohlsdorf said the $58 million the company holds in cash and marketablesecurities is comforting to customers.andP;  &quot;It helps us from a marketingstandpoint.andP;  Our vice president of international marketing has told me it'snice to be able to walk into a customer's office and show them the balancesheet.andP;  They know then that we'll be around for a long time.&quot;andM;CEO Edenfield said, &quot;We didn't just let it [cash] build up.andP;  It was planned.andO;We feel it's important that when talking to a large multinational companythat they can be reassured to see our resources.&quot;andM;Kohlsdorf and vice presidents Paul DiBono and Jack Gable make up a committeethat is charged with finding an acquisition opportunity for some of thatcash.andP;  American Software, whose products run exclusively on IBM mainframes,midrange systems and PCs, said it is looking at acquiring software thatoperates in other environments, notably Unix or VMS from Digital EquipmentCorp., based in Maynard, Mass.andM;Said Vleeschhouwer, a DEC or Unix acquisition &quot;would make sense because theircurrent software is used in manufacturing and distribution applications wherethere is probably a high number of those boxes.&quot;andM;According to DiBono, &quot;The ideal [acquisition] candidate would be a productand not a body shop where the real assets could walk out the door.andP;  We'relooking for something complementary to our current product line, somethingthat wouldn't dilute what we've already got.&quot;andM;Said Kohlsdorf, &quot;But we don't feel an overwhelming need to go out and spendthat money.andP;  We're taking our time and evaluating things carefully.andP;  We'vegotten a flood of proposals.&quot;andM;And an acquisition of American Software would be extremely difficult foranother company, because Edenfield and Newberry hold 28% of the company'sequity.andM;With software available for distribution, manufacturing, financial,healthcare and public utilities applications, an acquisition would have to bean adjunct to those lines or for another industry entirely.andP;  Edenfield saidthat retail, financial and healthcare are among the industries they haveconsidered.andP;  He said an overseas acquisition would be preferable to adomestic purchase, with non-U.S.andP;  revenues expected to be a full third of thecompany's total sales within four years.andP;  Overseas sales accounted for 16% of1990 revenue, up from 11% a year earlier.andM;A DIFFICULT RETROFITandM;But the company acknowledges that buying an existing product would besomewhat difficult to retrofit to its unique product packaging techniques.andM;Since 1975, American Software has used an automated approach to buildingpackaged software, which it calls the Solution Builder.andP;  The mainframe-basedsystem provides sales representatives with a checklist of features thecustomer selects, and the source code is automatically assembled on a modularbasis.andP;  The package includes a complete source library with JCL and iscompiled and tested before it leaves American Software's building.andM;&quot;The concept of packaged software for large-scale systems is tantamount toasking every driver to drive a Winnebago,&quot; said Gable.andP;  &quot;When you start toput all the features that everyone might need in one package, you getsomething that is huge.andP;  We have taken the approach that you don't have topay for and suffer the overhead for that which you don't need.&quot;andM;But, he said, &quot;It would be both easy and tedious work to fit an acquiredproduct into this after the fact, rather than keeping it in mind duringproduct development.&quot;andM;DiBono likened the Solution Builder to IBM's Systems Application Architecture(SAA)--IBM's software blueprint across platforms--in that both concepts havea goal of interoperability.andP;  The Solution Builder can use one set of sourcecode to create the same application for multiple target environments.andP;  Healso noted that American Software was one of 12 companies that participatedin IBM's 1989 SAA announcement.andM;With the Solution Builder customers can select, for example, an accountsreceivable configuration that has a customer number field that matches thenumber of digits they currently use, Gable said.andP;  Although customers areprovided source code for the purchased applications and could change suchdetails themselves, the automated Solution Builder eliminates the necessityof modifying the application each time an update is shipped.andP;  For new salesof software, he said, the technique also allows American Software to shiporders quickly, typically within one month of receiving the order.andM;PROFESSIONAL SERVICES GROWINGandM;For customer needs that go beyond what is offered by the Solution Builder,American Software offers a range of services, including consulting, training,project management and implementation assistance.andP;  From $8 million in 1987,professional services grew to $37 million in 1990.andP;  Edenfield said he expectsthat sector to continue to grow.andM;&quot;American companies have really cut their costs to the bone in an attempt toremain competitive and our customers would, by a 70% margin, prefer to buytheir services from the software provider rather than a third party,&quot;Edenfield said.andM;Gene Crouch, vice president for customer support, said that in addition tothe 24-hour support line, documentation, project guidance and accountmanagement offered as part of American Software's licensing agreements, thecompany strongly urges customers to contract for an implementation strategyconference.andP;  The three-day conference is held on the customer site to map outan implementation plan.andM;As for the future, American Software plans to offer support for distributedprocessing, and to place a greater reliance on its midrange products as themainframe market sales soften.andP;  The company also plans continued aggressiveoverseas expansion.andP;  A number of relationships have been signed with overseasdistributors in the last year and more agreements are expected.andM;The company is now at work on a national language feature that will boost itsoverseas operations.andP;  Users will be able to optionally choose the languagethey wish to work in.andM;Analyst Vleeschhouwer said the foreign language project is &quot;very interesting&quot;and will likely boost overseas sales.andP;  &quot;I suspect it will accelerate theirforeign business in non-English speaking countries,&quot; he said.andM;Edenfield said that research and development would be funded with part of thecompany's cash.andP;  Randamp;D expenditures have held constant at about $5 millionannually for the last three years, although the amount as a part of softwarelicense fees has declined largely because of increases in software sales.andM;CEO Edenfield said that Randamp;D also gets a boost from contract programming,where some developments can be moved into the products side of the business.andM;About five years ago, American Software was able to effectively double itsRandamp;D dollars through a deal made with an investment group.andP;  The investorsprovided half of the funds for a $6 million effort in which American Softwarewould develop an accounts receivable application and manufacturing softwarefor the IBM System/38 processor.andP;  The contract, with royalties to be paidlater, specified a fixed price with the developer to pay overruns, butAmerican Software was able to bring the project in for slightly less than $6million.andM;Edenfield said the choice of the S/38 was fortuitous because it later turnedout to be the platform most closely allied with the newer and popular AS/400.andO;He said the conversion from the S/38 to the AS/400 was relatively simple, butif they selected the S/36 years ago it would have been far more difficult.andM;The AS/400 product line produced $15 million in American Software salesduring 1989 and Edenfield predicted that sector will grow rapidly.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
