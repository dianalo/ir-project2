Big deal. Today is a holiday, too. St. Urho's Day.    Born several decades ago during another long winter of boredom in northern Minnesota, the legend of the fictional Finnish saint began as a satirical offshoot of St. Patrick. Trouble is, some people are getting a bit carried away.    Governors of all 50 states, badgered by enthusiastic Finnish-Americans, have issued proclamations declaring that March 16th is St. Urho's Day. The saint's backers are soliciting Congress to make this date a national holiday. And in Helsinki, Finland, where the country's patron saint was never heard of until 20 years ago, there is now a St. Urho's Pub. What next, a parade on New York's Fifth Avenue?    &quot;It's just to let the Irish know the rest of the world has their traditions as well,&quot; says Ted Melander of Minneapolis, a celebrant of St. Urho's Day for 30 years.    But St. Urho worshipers sure have some weird traditions. St. Patrick became famous for chasing the snakes out of Ireland. As legend has it, St. Urho shooed grasshoppers out of Finland with a pitchfork, saving the country's grapevines from the critters. Thus, fans of the &quot;hopper chopper&quot; don colors of royal purple and pale green to symbolize the grape and the grasshopper. And they quaff purple beer and chant: &quot;Heinasirkka, heinasirkka, mene taalta hiiteen!&quot; (Translation: &quot;Grasshopper, grasshopper, go away!&quot;)    Not everyone finds all this folklore amusing. &quot;They're trying to steal the limelight from the good Catholic St. Patrick,&quot; says Al Snider, who is trying to organize the St. Patrick's Day parade in his hometown of Bemidji, Minn. -- in the midst of St. Urho revelers. &quot;They shouldn't be allowed to use the title of saint.&quot;    Nobody in northern Minnesota seems to know how the St. Urho myth got started. Back in 1958 the holiday's original celebration date was switched to March 16 from May 24, and the coupling with St. Patrick's Day made the tale popular. So popular, in fact, that Menahga, Minn. -- which claims to be the &quot;Home of St. Urho&quot; -- has erected a 13-foot statue of its hero, a bearded figure who grasps a pitchfork with a threefoot grasshopper impaled on the prongs.    Does it matter whether you're Irish or Finnish to celebrate St. Urho's or St. Patrick's? Mr. Melander thinks not. &quot;People always use holidays as a good excuse to belt down a few.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
