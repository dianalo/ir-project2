Norton said it earned $17 million, or 81 cents a share, after a tax-loss carry-forward credit of $5 million. In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned $5.9 million, or 30 cents a share. Sales rose about 16% to $300.4 million from $259.9 million.    Norton makes abrasives, ceramics and chemicals, and, through joint ventures, supplies drilling products and services to the energy industry.    The company said its results for the third quarter benefited from a reduction in its tax rate to 24.5% from 49.6% a year earlier. The company added that its abrasives sales rose 22.4% during the quarter compared with year-earlier sales.    Norton said it narrowed its operating loss for the quarter to $700,000 in its petroleum-related business compared with a loss of $3.2 million a year ago. However, operating profit from the company's engineering materials business declined during the quarter.    For the nine months, Norton's earnings rose 22% to $49.3 million, or $2.37 a share, including a gain of $1.8 million from a tax credit offset by a loss from retirement of debt. Net income for the year-earlier period was $40.5 million, or $1.99 a share. Sales rose 8% to $917.5 million from $848.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
