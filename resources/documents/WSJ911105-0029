Washington's polls may be the most closely watched in thenation this year, because voters not only will decide theright-to-die measure but another widely debated initiativethat would limit the terms of elected officials on the stateand federal levels. Polls indicate that voters support bothmeasures.</LP><TEXT>   The &quot;Death with Dignity&quot; initiative would enablephysicians in certain cases to help end the lives ofterminally ill people without legal liability. Theterm-limits measure would mean, among other things, theouster of the state's Congressional delegation, includingHouse Speaker Thomas Foley, beginning with the 1994 election.Many legal scholars doubt the measure is constitutional.   Two other proposals will be considered in Washington: ameasure that would protect the right to abortion should theU.S. Supreme Court reverse Roe vs. Wade, and an initiativethat would roll back property tax assessments for residentswho purchased homes before 1985. The abortion-rights measureis expected to be approved; the tax proposal is consideredtoo close to call.   In Texas, voters are expected to approve a constitutionalamendment allowing a state-run lottery, a move thatproponents hope will alleviate the need for a state incometax.   A recent poll, conducted by Harte-Hanks CommunicationsInc., shows that nearly three out of four Texans favor alottery, and that even a majority of Baptists, traditionallyvocal opponents of legalized gambling, support it. One of themost fervent supporters has been Ann Richards, the newDemocratic governor.   If approved, scratch-off lottery tickets could beavailable for sale in July. Opponents, who argue that alottery amounts to a regressive tax and could fostercompulsive gambling, concede a low voter turnout probablywould be needed for them to defeat the measure.   Texans also will consider a proposal that would authorizethe issuing of up to $1.1 billion of general obligation bondsto build and renovate prisons and mental-health facilities.Voters in Houston, meanwhile, will vote on a $500 millionissue of general obligation bonds as part of the city'scapital improvement program.   Large bond-issue proposals in other states include a $737million issue for public facilities by Maricopa County,Ariz., and a $500 million issue for solid waste projects byOakland County, Mich.   Voters in Maine will decide the future of highwayexpansion in the state. A ballot measure would block a planto widen the Maine Turnpike and would create a new statepolicy favoring alternatives to highway building.   Trucking and construction groups say the measure would notonly stifle highway construction in the state but set adangerous precedent. They say the measure's requirement forpublic participation in transportation decision-making wouldadd to costs, delays and bureaucracy.   Environmentalists and other supporters of the measure sayscrapping the turnpike widening would free money to rebuildexisting roadways. They say that expansion of the state'shighway capacity, where alternatives are possible, wouldpromote greater use of automobiles, air pollution and use offoreign oil.   Elsewhere, voters in St. Louis will consider a $1.5billion issue to expand and modernize Lambert-St. LouisInternational Airport. On the state level, Missouri voterswill consider Proposition B, a $385 million education reformand tax measure that would set a 1.5% tax increase oncorporations with at least $100,000 in taxable net income,increase the state sales tax and raise the cigarette tax.   New Yorkers will consider three amendments to the stateconstitution. The first proposal would increase the state'sliability to guarantee payments on loans made by the JobDevelopment Authority, a public corporation, to as much as$900 million from the current $600 million. The purpose is togive the Job Development Authority the ability to raise moremoney through bond issues to make more economic developmentloans and create and retain more jobs, said Duncan MacKenzie,director of the state Senate Commerce Committee.   The second proposal would authorize the state to exchangesome forest preserve land in the Adirondack town of Ariettafor use in extending an airport runway, in exchange forforest preserve land in an adjacent town. The main purpose isto allow Arietta to cut down about 130 trees that have growninto the airport flight path, said Peter Edman, director ofthe Senate Banks Committee. This must be voted on because thetrees are on state land and the constitution prohibitscutting them down.   The third proposal would eliminate a prohibition on feeson New York's canal system, including the Erie Canal. Revenuewould go toward canal maintenance. Tolls would be set by thestate legislature.   New Jersey voters will consider two measures. One wouldamend the constitution to entitle a crime victim to betreated with &quot;fairness, compassion and respect&quot; by thecriminal justice system. The second question is a nonbindingreferendum to see if New Jersey should urge the U.S. Congressand president to enact a national health-care program.</TEXT></DOC>
