Fialka (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MDEST EUROP </CO><IN> ARO MON </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a major move to expand its air force, Saudi Arabia signed a new arms agreement with the United Kingdom with a value believed to exceed #7 billion ($12 billion).    The agreement is the largest ever negotiated by Britain. It involves construction of two new military airfields in Saudi Arabia and the purchase of about 50 Tornado fighter-bombers, at least 50 jet trainers and six mine sweepers, according to people in the British defense industry familiar with the accord.    The memorandum of agreement, signed July 3, will provide a &quot;significant enhancement&quot; to Saudi defense capabilities, the British Ministry of Defense said. The accord is the second phase to &quot;Project Al Yamamah,&quot; a #5 billion arms package that the British sold to the Saudis in 1985, the ministry added.    The sale marks a continuing shift away from U.S. weaponry by the Saudis; its requests to purchase U.S. F-15 fighters repeatedly have been defeated by Congress's strong pro-Israel lobby.    The British defense ministry said the package also includes a &quot;positive and constructive economic-offset program&quot; requiring British companies to spend money in the Arab kingdom. Fuller details of the new arms package are being withheld at the Saudis' request, according to the defense ministry.    Sources familiar with the arms agreement say the details of payment haven't yet been worked out. Even though Britain is a major oil producer, the sources believe the payment may be similar to that of the first arms purchase by Saudi Arabia in 1985. That was paid for by bartering 400,000 barrels of oil-a-day through 1990.    The main recipient of the agreement is British Aerospace PLC, a major U.K. aircraft maker and defense contractor that manufactures Tornados. Last year, it purchased a Dutch construction company, Ballast Nedam N.V., which has built several roads and airfields in Saudi Arabia. The industry sources said the construction segment of the package will go to the new Dutch subsidiary. British Aerospace said it couldn't elaborate beyond the government's statement.    Project Al Yamamah started in 1985 with the purchase of 72 Tornados, which can be used in both fighter and fighter-bomber roles. Those aircraft aren't believed to be operational yet, despite the Saudis' ambitious program to train Saudi pilots, using British and Swiss-made trainers.    Phasing in the rest of the aircraft and building the new bases likely will take ten years. The new bases would enhance Saudi defense capabilities by dispersing its aircraft over more areas in the large, desert country.    The Saudis will purchase as many as 90 helicopters from Westland PLC to move troops and for search and rescue missions, the sources said. Westland said it couldn't confirm the sale, but the company is marketing its Black Hawk helicopter in the Middle East.    In addition to British Aerospace and Westland, Vosper Thorneycroft PLC, which makes mine sweepers, is believed to be a major participant in the new arms package. A spokesman for the Portsmouth, England-based company said &quot;We are hopeful, but no contract has been signed yet.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
