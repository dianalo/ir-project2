Renewable energy resources offer a wide varietyof possible alternative ways to provide situationally appropriate answersto this budget problem. This study described the renewable-energy-resource-systemoptions in such detail as to enable educational leaders to make choicesin directing planners to do further feasibility studies and in applyingexisting technologies to current facilities and new construction. Someof the energy-resource categories examined were as follows: solar (includingactive and passive solar heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting,photovoltaics, and solar salt ponds), wind, hydropower, biomass, andgeothermal. A good deal of the task was to describe the systems, to provideexamples, to review the literature, resources, and location of usage,to analyze their cost effectiveness, to determine standardization andavailability of technology, to review other feasibility considerations,and to examine institutional, governmental, and other inhibitors to useof available systems. All of the renewable-energy-resource systems havedemonstrated successful competition with traditional energy resourcesin appropriate settings.</TEXT></DOC>
