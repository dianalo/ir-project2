 If IBM's plan succeeds, this position of preemmence willlargely be achieved by IBM assuming the role of enterprise-wide manager.andO;NetView is IBM's strategic product line for delivering managementcapabilities across a broad array of network and systems needs.andP;  Thus, theNetView announcements of the past few years are a crucial part of IBM'slongrange plan for maintaining a strong account control position in thecomplicated open system environment of the 1990s.andM;This article will examine today's NetView, as well as IBM's plans forimproving iL It will also discuss the ways that NetView is coming underattack in the marketplace.andP;  To begin with, we will retrace the major NetViewannouncements of the past few yew.andP;  IBM's Management Architecture In thespring of 1986, IBM announced its Open Communications Architecture, of whichOpen Network Management is a part.andP;  Open Network Management is intended as aframework for the development of IBM management products, which are aimed atmanaging large SNA (Systems Network Architecture) networks.andP;  Throughpublished interfaces and message formats, IBM is also inviting other vendorsto implement compatibility with this architecture, in much the same way thatmost vendors implement at least limited SNA compatibility.andP;  Under thisframework, there are three major kinds of elements that perform managementfunctions: * Focal points, which provide centralized network managementandM;support.andP;  Focal points support the needs of human andandM;programmed operators and provide a central point for collecting,andM;analyzing, and storing network and system managementandM;data.andP;  The NetView family of products constitutesandM;IBM's strategic focal point products.andP;  * Entry points, which are SNA devicesthat are capable ofandM;implementing the management services architecture forandM;themselves and other attached products.andP;  Most IBM data networkandM;products are capable of functioning as entry points.andP;  * Service points, whichprovide management support forandM;themselves and attached devices and networks that are notandM;capable of being entry points (e.g., IEEE 802 LANs orandM;PBXs).andP;  The service point is capable of sending networkandM;management data about non-SNA systems to a focal point,andM;and it is capable of receiving commands from a focal point toandM;be executed on the non-SNA systems.andP;  The service point isandM;thus a network management gateway of sorts, translatingandM;between the SNA formats and those of non-SNA devices.andM;NetView/PC is IBM's major service point product, although,andM;as we will see later, other management packages now containandM;embedded service points.andM;IBM hailed these announcements as a major strategic initiative.andP;  They doindeed set a direction for IBM.andP;  First and foremost, they establish the S/370mainframe as the focus of management capabilities within the IBM productline.andP;  However, these announcements also established IBM's intention to usethe focal point to manage afl the information resources of the enterprise,even those from other vendors, through the agency of the service point.andP;  Theypreempted other vendors and gave IBM a major marketing lead for about a yearand a half.andP;  As we will see, other vendors are now actively competing withIBM for control of the enterprise-wide focal point.andM;Very recently, IBM has been informally showing an expanded version of itsopen management architecture.andP;  It adds the following architectural elements:* Secondary focal points, which are redundant focal points thatandM;can take over in case the primary focal point fails.andP;  ReactingandM;to the need for high availability of the focal point, IBM willandM;be providing increased support for multiple focal pointsandM;which are able to back each other up.andP;  * Nested focal points, which providedistributed managementandM;support for segments of large networks while still forwardingandM;critical information up to more global focal points.andP;  * Collection points,which provide a network managementandM;relay function from a self-contained SNA subnetwork to aandM;standard focal point.andP;  It would appear that the AS/400 win actandM;as a collection point for IBM peer-to-peer networks of mid-rangeandM;systems.andM;IBM has not announced these updates to the architecture, and there have beenno formal estimates on when these  types of functions will be added toNetView and other products.andP;  However, the direction is clear.andP;  IBM will bedeveloping the capability for a more distributed approach to network andsystem management that allows many different IBM network management systemsto work together to deliver enterprise-wide management The NetView ProductLine IBM's approach to network management today is firmly oriented towardcentralization of management, and it is NetView that provides the primaryenvironment for execution of centralized functions.andP;  NetView also providesthe human interface to network management functions.andP;  NetView runs on an IBMmainframe under the MVS or VM operating systems.andP;  Every mainframe host in anIBM network must run NetView to make it visible to operators.andP;  NetView is aconsolidation of previous IBM network management products.andP;  The initialrelease of NetView primarily addressed the problem of providing an operatoraccess to these different network management functions from a singleterminal, allowing the operator to move from one function to another quicklyand easily.andP;  As part of this user interface development, changes were made inspecific displays to make them more consistent and easy to use.andM;The second release of NetView, announced in spring of 1987, extended theoperator's reach to include management of the operating system and majorapplication subsystems (e.g., TSO, IBM's mainframe timesharing monitor, andCICS, IBM's transaction processing environment).andP;  Release 2 also introduced avariety of capabilities for automating routine operator tasks and improvingthe filtering of information to be displayed to operators.andM;The third release of NetView, announced in the fall of 1988, brought higherlevel language support to user-written procedures, commands, and exitroutines.andP;  It also included support for network devices to dynamicallyprovide NetView with key configuration data (which IBM calls vital productdata).andP;  In Release 3, IBM also began to lay the groundwork for bringing OSImanagement data into NetView.andM;NetView is a message-routing and task-scheduling subsystem that allowsmultiple operators to use many different functions.andP;  It brings under a singleuser interface what were previously a number of separate management programs.andO;The most important NetView functions are the following: * The Commandfacility is the base component of NetView.andP;  It  replaces the former NetworkCommunication and Control  Facility  NOCF).andP;  An operator interacts with theCommand  facility for basic command entry and response display.andP;  *The SessionMonitor collects and correlates data about SNA  sessions and providesinteractive access to this data for the  operator.andP;  The Session Monitorreplaces the former Network  Logical Data Monitor (NLDM).andP;  *The HardwareMonitor collects error and information records  from network devices andprovides an alert display.andP;  The  Hardware Monitor replaces the former NetworkProblem  Determination Aid (NPDA).andP;  *The Status Monitor displays a summary ofnetwork conditions.andP;  It replaces the VTAM Node Control Application  (VNCA).andO;*The Help Desk facility provides step-by-step problem determination assistance to operators.andP;  *The Browse facility enables an operator to viewvarious files  that NetView maintains, including the network log.andP;  *The Helpfacility provides extensive information to operators  on how to use NetViewand the meaning of various displays.andP;  It has over 1,500 help panels.andM;In addition to these functions, which are included with the base produce IBMoffers a Solution Pack, which is a large collection of command procedures(known as CLISTS) that enhance and extend NetView's functionality.andP;  Forexample, the Solution Pack provides an automated Help Desk function, whichautomatically issues commands for the operator who is trying to ascertain thecause of a routine network problem.andM;IBM also offers a number of other products under the NetView product linename.andP;  These other products, while very important for managing IBM networks,are only loosely integrated with the main NetView product.andP;  Two importantones are: *NetView Distribution Manager, which is a mainframe-based  productfor configuration and change management of software  for mid-range andlow-end systems, such as the  AS/400, and for PS/2s.andP;  It allows scheduleddownloading and  installation of new copies of software and maintains arepository  of currently deployed software.andP;  * NetView Network PerformanceMonitor, which collects andandM;analyzes detailed SNA network performance data.andP;  It is capableandM;of displaying the results in graphical form.andP;  NetView's Protocol Formats Thekey to IBM's goal of establishing NetView as a new de facto standard isacceptance by other vendors of IBM's protocol interface for networkmanagement data.andP;  Under IBM's architecture, management data flows from anentry point or a service point to a focal point  over an SNA session, whichprovides reliable, connection-oriented, network transport The basic SNAmessage unit for all types of information is cared a Request/Response Unit(RU).andP;  The specific RU type reserved for management data is called thenetwork management vector transport RU (NMVT).andM;NMVTs are composed of a major vector that contains a variable number ofsubvectors.andP;  NMVTs are primarily used to send alerts (i.e., events or alarms)to the focal point.andP;  Hence, the most important major vector is the alertmajor vector.andM;Most of the data in an NMVT is contained in subvectors, each of which is ofandM;variable length and may contain specific subfields.andP;   This flexible mandM;essage structure allows for modular messages and makes it easy to add newfields.andM;IBM's approach to reporting network management data is a model of compactcoding for efficiency.andP;  Most fields within subvectors are one or two bytes inlength and contain codes (called code points) that index into tables on themainframe which contain text strings to insert in operator displays.andP;  Thus,alerts are constructed from a set of building blocks (subvectors, subfields,and fields), which contain instructions, so to speak, on how to construct amessage to display to an operator.andP;  This method of constructing alerts byconcatenating standard information units (causes, types of alert,reccommended actions, etc.) is called generic alerts.andP;  IBM has published itstables of standard code-point strings and encourages other vendors toimplement NMVT support in their devices.andM;In addition to the alert vectors, there are specialized NMVT formats definedfor the service point command facility (SPCF), by which a focal point sendsan embedded command to a service point for execution on the target system(s)managed by the service point.andP;  These formats allow target-specific commandstrings to be embedded in the SNA messages to the service point.andM;The generic alert mechanism is a good solution to the problem of isolatingdevice-specific information within the code point.andP;  However, there is still aneed for device-specific alerts that convey information and conditions thatare not defined in the generic alert code point tables.andP;  IBM has defined manyspecific subvectors for SDLC link stations, various aspects of theToken-Ring, Token-Ring bridges, and other devices.andP;  Although IBM claims thatthe generic alert mechanism is suitable for conveying information about awide variety of nonSNA devices, this is not likely to be the case.andP;  Realmanagement of non-IBM equipment will require the definition of device-specific subvectors in most cases.andP;  When asked how other vendors can get newcode points added to the generic alert definitions, IBM has responded bysaying that the vendor should fill out and send in the reader comment card onthe back of the SNA Formats and Protocols manual in which the generic alertcode points are defined!andM;There are major deficiencies in IBM's proprietary approach to exchangingnetwork management information: * It is blatantly hierarchical andasymmetrical.andP;  InformationandM;flows to the focal point, and commands flow from the focalandM;point.andP;  Thus, only vendors of management systems for networkandM;subsystems (TI, modems, etc.) are likely to participateandM;willingly in this approach to multivendor management AandM;truly viable multivendor standard would have to be peer-to-peer.andP;  * Itsapproach lacks a data model to guide the definition ofandM;information to be exchanged among management systems.andM;IBM has defined a laundry list of alerts, causes, actions, andandM;identifiers which has no architecture behind it other than aandM;very high-level set of numbering conventions for codeandM;points.andP;  This makes it impossible for anyone but IBM toandM;define extensions to the formats and message W&quot;, andandM;means that the formats really only apply meaningfully toandM;managing IBM products.andP;  * It lacks a mechanism for exchanging configurationinformation.andP;  * The service point command facility is extremely primitiveandM;and provides no standardization of command functions.andM;Nonetheless, IBM's standards will be used by many users and third parties toprovide increased functionality on top of what NetView already provides.andO;Also, IBM will continue to expand the scope of its standards and thericliness of their functionality.andP;  The service point command facility willdefinitely be augmented.andP;  IBM has promised to publish a real data model alongwith its new repository applications.andM;A race is on between IBM formats and OSI formats as the basis of multivendornetwork management.andP;  IBM's advantage here remains the large existinginstalled base of IBM equipment It has used this advantage in the past tomake SNA the de facto corporate backbone protocol standard, and it isattempting do that again in the network management standard area.andP;  NetViewand OSI Networks After IBM announced its Open Management Architecture, theother major computer and communication system vendors, most notably Digitaland ATandamp;T, refused to acknowledge it as a new de facto standard.andP;  Instead,they proposed a vendor-independent standard based on emerging ISO work inOSI-based network management.andP;  ATandamp;T has been particularly aggressive inpushing the OSI alternative for linking different vendors' network managementsystems.andM;IBM's position on OSI networking has been clearly articulated.andP;  SNA protocolswill be used to link IBM equipment, while OSI protocols will be used tointerface to other networking architectures.andP;  IBM has been trying to portrayOSI as an inter-architecture standard and does not yet accept OSI protocolsas a sm&quot; basis for general networking.andP;  Ibis stance is quite reasonable fromIBM's point of view.andP;  It has invested so heavily in SNA, and its customershave such a large installed base of SNA equipment, that IBM cannot afford tomigrate from SNA to OSI.andP;  Of course, SNA also represents a major means forIBM to retain a large portion of the Fortune 500 networking market share.andO;IBM's stance on OSI network management paral- lels its general positiontoward OSI.andP;  IBM networks will be managed using SNA management informationformats and protocols.andP;  OSI management protocols will be limited to exchanging network management information with other q&quot; of networks.andM;The initial OSI management interface for IBM systems will be part of IBM'snewly announced OSI/Communications Subsystem (OSI/CS), which will provide afull implementation of the seven layers of the OSI model.andP;  IBM will implementthe OSI Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) under OSI/CS.andP;  Thiswill allow OSI/CS to report events to other OSI management systems and/or toreceive CMEP messages.andP;  OSI/CS will also be able to translate a CMIP eventmessage into an SNA NMVT generic alert, which can be forwarded to NetView.andM;IBM is certain to attempt to position NetView as a platform for managingmultivendor OSI networks.andP;  From today's vantage point, this would appeardifficult, since NetView is so heavily tied to IBM proprietary protocols.andP;  Atruly bilingual NetView that could also directly use OSI management protocolswould be a powerful asset to IBM's goal of establishing NetView as theenterprise-wide information system manager.andP;  IBM has indicated do laterreleases of NetView will directly receive CMIP messages, although atranslation to generic alert format will most likely be required for manyyears to come.andP;  IBM's network management applications are very specificallydesigned for SNA concepts, structure, and formats.andP;  Every screen containsdata that is specific to SNA.andP;  Adapting NetView to manage networks of OSIsystems would essentially require entirely new applications.andM;IBM is not doing anything to speed up the adoption of OSI standards, but itis certainly not ignoring the OSI movement, either.andP;  It is participatingheavily in the standards process, including the management standardizationeffort, and in trials for ISDN and OSI protocols.andP;  IBM is more aggressivelypursuing OSI products in Europe, where users' demands for OSI are stronger.andO;IBM is hedging against the possibility that OSI becomes the dominantarchitecture, but that is not the outcome it favors.andP;  IBM LAN Management IBMhas taken a five-part approach to managing the TokenRing that dividesresponsibility for different levels of the com- munication function Automatic detection and bypass of media and station  adapter failures throughmechanisms embedded  in the station adapters themselves.andP;  Some of  thesemechanisms are part  of the 802.5 standard, and others are IBM extensions.andO;These mechanisms automatically detect and correct the loss of a token or afailure in a transmitter or receiver.andP;  Certain wiring faults (breaks betweenmultistation access units) require manual reconfiguration.andP;  Breaks in lobewiring are automatically detected and bypassed.andP;  Standards are also definedfor stations to record errors they detect or observe.andP;  Distributed managementservers, which reside on a single ring and are usually located in bridges.andO;They provide these management services to stations: A: Ring Error Monitor(REM), which collects error statisticsandM;from stations.andP;  REM monitors the status of the ring (normal or in errorrecovery) and tabulates errors accordingandM;to where the fault occurred and the error type.andP;  B : Ring Parameter Server(RPS), which provides parametersandM;to new stations being inserted into the ring.andP;  At theandM;moment, there are very few parameters that are loaded atandM;insertion time.andP;  The major one is the ring number.andP;  C:  Configuration ReportServer (CRS), which collects reportsandM;of changes in the physical or logical configurationandM;of the ring.andP;  D: LAN Bridge Server  LBS), which maintains statistics onandM;bridge activity, such as number of frames forwarded.andP;  E: LAN ReportingMechanism  (LRM) which runs a managementandM;session between per-ring servers and multiringandM;management applications.andP;  Local LAN management applications, which provide alocal operator with a means  of interacting with embedded LAN managementfacilities and distributed  management server functions.andP;  The mainstreamproduct for this is now the IBM LAN  Manager (not to be confused with theMicrosoft/3Com software for OS/2  client-server computing).andP;  The IBM LANManager provides a number of fault,  configuration, and performancemanagement functions for LAN stations and  bridges.andP;  The LAN Managercommunicates with the LRM using the IEEE logical link  control (LLC)protocol, not SNA protocols.andP;  The LAN Manager is capable of  managing bridgedrings and IBM broadband PC networks.andP;  *Hierarchical centralized management ofLAN transport  through a service point interface to a focal point.andP;  Version2.0  of the IBM LAN Manager provides a service point interface  to NetView.andO;This allows alerts generated by LAN components,  including REM and the LANManager, to be forwarded  to NetView.andP;  Version 2.0 also takes advantage ofthe  Service Point Command Facility to receive commands from  NetViewoperators.andP;  *Direct centralized management of SNA devices residing on  theLAN from a NetView focal point.andP;  Most devices attached  to the LAN canfunction as entry points, but they do not  report on LAN media conditions.andM;Thus, IBM's approach is to treat the LAN as a specialized transport subsystemwhich must be managed through a service point.andP;  This is similar to the way itwould treat the management of other transport subsystems, such as a TIbackbone.andM;IBM provides no capabilities for managing Ethernets (802.3).andP;  Some vendors(e.g., Ungemann-Bass) have announced NetView/PC service point applicationsthat will allow some integrated management of Ethernets from NetView.andO;NetView/PC IBM's plan for multivendor management integration depends heavilyon NetView/PC, which provides an easily accessible environment in which thirdparties and other vendors can write service point applications.andP;  The originalNetView/PC was implemented under MS-DOS, which severely limited what could bedone with it.andP;  Routines had to be written in assembler language.andP;  For theseand other reasons, most vendors have not moved aggressively to get theirNetView/PC applications out into the market.andM;In addition, users have not bought NetView/PC.andP;  Since each link to a non-SNAmanagement system requires its own copy of NetView/PC, large users would findthemselves needing dozens of them.andP;  Data Communications magazine has reportedthat only 60 copies of NetView/PC are in active use now.andP;  IBM disputes thesefigures, however.andM;Lan fall, IBM announced Version 1.2 of NetView/PC, which operates on the PS/2under OS/2 Extended Edition (OS/ 2 EE).andP;  Applications may now be written alsoin C or PL/l.andP;  These changes will make NetView/PC much more viable and shouldresult in some important new third-party products based on iL Managing OtherTypes of Networks IBM has been following through on its efforts to extendNetView's reach.andP;  Last fall, the company unveiled the IBM TransmissionNetwork Manager, which is an OS/2 EE-based network management system fornetworks of Network Equipment Technology's IDNX T1 multiplexers.andP;  TheTransmission Network Manager features color graphics, windows, a relationaldatabase and proprietary ties to NetView.andP;  With this product, IBM customerscan begin to automate T1 network management from NetView.andP;  The TransmissionNetwork Manager is also a glimpse of what IBM's future NetView managementworkstation should look like.andM;IBM has also announced a number of different application software packagesfor managing voice networks.andP;  The latest announcements featured products thatwere developed for IBM by third parties and that offer interfaces to PBXsfrom many suppliers.andP;  NetView's Automation Facilities IBM has made networkand system automation the new hot topic.andP;  Recognizing the appeal to itscustomers of providing the means of reducing the number of operationspersonnel, IBM has been advocating the development of automation plans basedon NetView's capabilities.andP;  In addition, automation can improve the rapidityof response to failure conditions and hence increase availability.andM;IBM is currently concentrating its automation efforts on responses tooperator display messages.andP;  Through the Message Table facility, it ispossible to define standard responses to routine conditions, such asrestarting lines or devices.andP;  The Message Table entry can be a single commandor an invocation of a CLIST for more complicated actions.andM;CLISTs are command language scripts that are interpreted at run-time.andP;  IBMsupplies a set of sample CLISTs with NetView that perform a number of systemand network automation  functions.andP;  Triggered off the message table, CLISTscan simulate the responses of real operators to system and subsystem queries,thus speeding up execution of routine functions such as start-up.andP;  Release 3of NetView will make it possible to write these types of response routines inIBM's REXX language, which is a so-called 4GL or very high-level language.andM;It is also possible to write user exits to initiate responses to particularmessages.andP;  Another possibility would be to write a user command task that isinvoked from the message table.andP;  With Release 3, these types of routines canbe written in assembler, PL/1, or C.andM;The most common action taken on a received message is to throw it away.andP;  Thevast majority of messages reaching the system console of an IBM mainframe donot need to be seen by an operator.andP;  Most others can be handled with anautomated response.andP;  Thus, all but a few messages can be filtered fromoperator displays, resulting in a much simpler monitoring task for theoperator.andP;  In one example cited by IBM, a total of 665,000 messages weregenerated to the NetView log in one day.andP;  These were filtered and handledautomatically to the point where only 160 were displayed on the operator'sterminal!andM;More sophisticated automation of network and system management will requiresome form of expert system.andP;  IBM is known to be working on various expertsystem projects, some of which are surely in the area of network and systemsmanagement However, the company has made no announcements concerning theiravailability.andP;  NetView's lack of an integrated management database for statusand configuration data is a major obstacle to development of an expertsystem.andP;  NetView's Major Functional Deficiencies IBM has so far concentratedits network management effort in the fault management area.andP;  Most of thedisplays in NetView are oriented toward displaying network status informationand alerts.andP;  A secondary emphasis has been on performance management,specifically response-time monitoring.andP;  IBM is definitely able to obtaindetailed information for troubleshooting hardware or software problems in itsown devices.andP;  However, that information is presented on a number of differentscreen panels in a cumbersome manner, making troubleshooting more difficultthan it should be.andM;IBM is still very weak in the configuration and change management area,although the NetView/Distribution Manager product is a major improvement fordistributed departmental systems.andP;  IBM's inability to dynamically changenetwork configuration and parameters is a ma-  jor shortcoming of SNA networkmanagement The lack of an integrated configuration database is a majordeficiency.andP;  IBM also appears to have no architectural solution to thenetwork directory problem.andP;  The lack of a directory services architecture isa major shortcoming in SNA and will become an increasingly big problem asdistributed networks increase in importance.andM;The major shortcoming of IBM's approach with NetView is the continuedfragmentation and compartmentalization of its features, apparently the effectof IBM's development methodologies, which do not usually result in productswith a unified sense of design.andP;  Although IBM has put the word NetView in thetitle of every new host-based network management product, in reality, itsproducts are hardly integrated.andM;In addition, NetView consumes a significant number of expensive mainframeresources in relation to the functionality it provides.andP;  Release 2 of NetViewshows significant performance improvements over Release 1.andP;  However, there issome reason to doubt the cost effectiveness of this approach to networkmanagement, especially when many vendors are building their systems onhigh-end wotkstations, one per operator.andP;  Of course, IBM is aiming atmanagement of very large corporate networks of 50,000 or more end points, forwhich workstation-based solutions would hardly suffice.andM;NetView can shoulder only some of the blame for the difficulty of managing anSNA network.andP;  The basic rigidity and inflexibility of SNA, as well as itsinability to cope with dynamically changing network configurations, representthe primary reasons for the difficulty of managing networks based on thisarchitecture.andP;  What about Peer-to-Peer Networks? Most of IBM's networkmanagement product improvements over the past two years have been orientedtoward improving the management of the large, existing SNA networks installedin IBM's largest customer accounts.andP;  IBM is tom between the need to keepthese, its most important customers, happy and its desire to meet theemerging challenge of distributed networking laid down by such competitors asDigital, HP, Sun, and Apollo.andM;IBM faces a chicken-and-egg problem with distributed networking support.andO;Most IBM customers are not making production use of SNA's peer-to-peerextensions yet.andP;  One of the reasons is that there are very few tools formanaging these peer-to-peer sessions.andP;  Yet, IBM is not prioritizing therelease of products that are optimized to managing distributed networks,presumably since there are no large systems depending upon it.andP;  Inparticular, IBM has not faced up to the possibility that the mainframe maynot be the correct vehicle for managing networks of low-cost distributedprocessors.andM;IBM appears to be leaving pure networks of mid-range systems (S/3x, AS/400)stranded.andP;  When these systems are in use in a larger context of enterpriseSNA networks, they will be given increasing visibility to the focal point.andO;But when they are the sole basis for a distributed application environment,they may have to rely on the less fully-developed management capabilitiesthat are resident on these systems.andP;  Stay Tuned for the Repository Perhapsthe weakest area of NetView is its lack of database support for inventorymanagement, configuration management, directory services, amble tickets,trending, and so forth.andP;  IBM has outlined its solution to this problem inwhat it calls the repository.andP;  This will be one or more relational databaseswhich will store non-real-time network management data and administrativeinformation.andP;  NetView will stiff need specialized files for real-timeprocessing.andP;  Historical data, trouble tickets, and inventory data will bestored in the repository.andP;  The current NetView Distribution Manager is anindication of this direction.andP;  It provides a repository for centrally storingdata about software configurations in distributed processors and plans fortransmitting changes.andM;The DB/2 relational database product is almost surely going to be the basisof the repository, since it is IBM's mainstream database offering and it isincluded as a key element of the SAA definitions.andP;  IBM has also stated thatit will present a data model for the structure of the database that includesguidelines for extending the database.andP;  This is similar to what ATandamp;T iscurrently doing in its specification of OSI management classes.andM;IBM has stated that an announcement on the repository will appear this year,probably before summer.andP;  IBM will begin to segregate the different functionalareas of network management into centralized administrative applicationsbased on the repository, distributed real-time operations functions that usesubsets of repository data, and more limited hooks into operating systemsoftware, eliminating the need to run a fun copy of NetView on each host.andO;Notice that NetView itself is primarily concerned with message and commandrouting and automated task operation.andM;The big question is what applications IBM will provide along with therepository and how open it will be.andP;  If it is open, many third-partyapplications will appear that will enhance the usefulness of the repositoryto users.andP;  Next, the Integrated Workstation IBM is aware of the gap betweenits network displays and those of most other networking vendors.andP;  Color textis the state of the art for NetView and NetView/PC displays.andP;  Wedded to the3270 character mode terminal, NetView is unable to use the windowingparadigm.andM;IBM is working on an integrated workstation for network management based onthe PS/2 and OS/2 that incorporates a graphics interface.andP;  IBM has statedthat this workstation will become a common interface to aU IBM networkmanagement products for low-end, mid-range, and mainframe systems.andM;The workstation software will be written to SAA guidelines (all new IBMsoftware must meet these guidelines) and will probably communicate with themainframe using LU6.2 sessions.andP;  It will be interesting to see if IBMpublishes the details of the interface with NetView.andP;  If it does, expect tosee lots of clones of IBM's workstation.andM;IBM says that the key to the workstation will be its task orientation.andP;  Theuser interface will be defined in terms of specific tasks that each member ofthe operations center must accomplish as part of its daily responsibilities,such as installing new equipment or diagnosing a problem.andP;  The actualfunctions that implement these tasks will be largely hidden from the user bythe new interface.andM;The workstation will also support multiple operator sessions to a variety ofsubsystems.andP;  Operators will be able to switch between different sessionsthrough function keys.andP;  Presumably, it will finally offer IBM networkoperators a windowing user interface so they can work with more than onething on dc screen at the same time.andP;  The Battle Is Joined For the past Omyears, IBM has been setting the pace in network and system management,despite the general shortcomings of its existing products.andP;  Never has thesobriquet &quot;In- adequate But Marketable&quot; applied so well to Big Blue.andP;  Itsmajor strategy of setting a de facto standard is at least partially working,and the company is in a strong position with regard to multivendorintegration.andP;  Much will depend on what choices users make.andP;  IBM is certainlypressuring its large customers to go with NetView.andM;IBM has made automation and the integrated management of systems and networksthe new strategic issue.andP;  It has a strong story to tell, especially since itcontrols so much of the systems market.andM;Most other vendors are adopting OSI protocols as the means of competing withIBM.andP;  ATandamp;T, in particular, has made aggressive moves to establish the OSIalternative as a viable contender to NetView for enterprise-wide managementintegration.andP;  Last summer, ATandamp;T announced a joint development agreement withCincom Systems, which sells the only true competitor to NetView.andP;  Itsproduct, called Net/Master, offers most of the same features as NetView, butwith better performance, greater flexibility, and cleaner displays.andP;  Undertheir agreement, ATandamp;T and Cincom will develop an OSI link between Net/Masterand ATandamp;T's new integrated network management system, the AccumasterIntegrator.andP;  The ATandamp;T/Cincom team is a strong competitor to NetView.andP;  ButNET/MASTER has only 10 to 20 percent share of the SNA network managementmarket, and the Integrator is only in beta test now.andM;The success of this and other OSI-based alternatives to NetView depends onuser acceptance of the OSI approach and vendors' ability to achievecross-vendor compatibility.andP;  There is very little so far in IBM's approach tonetwork management that puts the company in a good position to compete in anOSI- dominated environment.andP;  However, its efforts toward implementing OSIsoftware are serious, if somewhat slow.andM;IBM has dramatically increased the amount of development resources devoted tonetwork management, and we should see a constant stream of new announcementsover the next few years.andP;  Whether or not these developments can be managed ina way to present an integrated, coherent network management system iscertainly in doubt Meanwhile, IBM's competitors will bring out a flood of newmanagement products with flashy user interfaces, OSI protocols, and supportfor distributed networks.andP;  With most vendors using Unix as their platform fornetwork management systems, a new software application market will mostlikely emerge that will strengthen the Unix alternative to IBM's mainframeorientation.andM;Will IBM's installed base be an asset or a liability? Backwards compatibilityand the need to continually meet current operational needs of its largestcustomers limit IBM's ability to innovate with NetView.andP;  Other vendors willoffer better technology that once the OSI standards are stable, will bebetter connected than NetView.andP;  It will certainly be interesting to see thebattle unfold.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
