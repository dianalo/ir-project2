The British company is the sole challenger to the industry's two giants, both of the U.S., General Electric Co. and the Pratt andamp; Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp. They are part of huge industrial conglomerates, and Rolls isn't. And, because the market is U.S.-dominated, a base in strong-currency Britain ought to prove a critical handicap, with exports priced in dollars translating into fewer British pounds to pay for development and labor costs.    But Rolls is demonstrating particular vigor lately. A prized sale last month to AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit, which ordered #1 billion ($1.79 billion) of Rolls engines to power 50 new Boeing 757s, underscored the British maker's competitiveness. Rolls hailed the sale -- to a big and tough customer outside its usual base of United Kingdom and Commonwealth airlines -- as a &quot;breakthrough.&quot;    &quot;We're getting a very broad base of business, and we believe our market share is going to increase,&quot; says Sir Ralph Robins, Rolls managing director. A U.S. aerospace executive, who asks not to be identified, says the American sale &quot;was a very significant victory, but it remains to be seen if they can follow it up.&quot;    For years Rolls's market share has hovered around 20%, a steady No. 3 position maintained by long-established ties to customers like British Airways. In the future, Sir Ralph says, &quot;A 30% share would be a nice share.&quot; He reckons Rolls has about a 60% share of engines for the 757, while on the new generation of jumbo 747s the orders have been split exactly three ways.    Whether those strengths can translate into higher share depends partly on winning more U.S. customers. And Rolls faces fierce competition from Pratt and GE, which have strong ties with most U.S. customers as well as major Asian carriers. &quot;The American victory could be a step in that direction,&quot; says the U.S. executive. &quot;Rolls may very well gain at Pratt's expense.&quot;    But analysts question how profitable more orders will prove if current exchange rates prevail. &quot;At the end of the day they don't have the cost advantage of Pratt andamp; Whitney,&quot; says Robert Speed, aerospace analyst at London stockbrokers Phillips andamp; Drew. Alan Coats, a London-based analyst for Banque Paribas Capital Markets, voices similar worries over currencies and capital resources. But he says he is &quot;getting more positive&quot; because of the 757 sales. &quot;I could imagine their market share would tend to increase if the 757 becomes more popular,&quot; he says.    The company earlier this month announced plans to develop a new engine for Boeing's 767 and other big twin-aisled aircraft, for which it plans to seek an unspecified amount of British government aid. And it says much-publicized technical problems with the V2500 engine being developed in a consortium with Pratt and other companies for the Airbus Industrie A320 are sorted out.    Rolls's current strength rests on the very product that forced the company into receivership in 1971. Building the RB-211 engine, originally designed for Lockheed Corp.'s TriStar but now the base of the 757 and 747 engines, exhausted Rolls's cash. The government took over. In May of last year, Rolls -- minus the famous luxury-car business, acquired by Vickers PLC in 1980 -- returned to the private sector, raising #1.36 billion for the U.K. Treasury.    The government timed its sale well. Since then, the pound's continuing rise has scared investors away from the stock of companies with heavy dollar exposure. Rolls shares, which were nine times oversubscribed when offered at 170 pence ($3.04) each, have recently traded around 125 pence. Investors and analysts remain far warier about the company's prospects than Sir Ralph.    &quot;You won't find us doing a lot of moaning about the exchange rate,&quot; Sir Ralph says. &quot;Obviously we wouldn't like to see it at around $2, and we'd like to see $1.60.&quot; But, he says, &quot;if you have a strong economy, you're going to have a strong currency. Our first approach is we have to live with it.&quot;    Living with it doesn't mean doing nothing. Hedging -- Rolls locks in current exchange rates for most of the expected revenue each time it makes a sale -- helps soften the blow. Rolls is eliminating 2,000 more jobs, reducing the total to about 40,000. Between 1980 and 1984, the company cut 20,000 jobs. Sir Ralph says it continues to invest in automation, mating existing equipment with new computers.    But Sir Ralph says Rolls's exposure to currency problems is less than outsiders think. It buys many parts -- about 35% of the 757 engines, which were aimed from the first at U.S. customers -- in the U.S. And about half of Rolls's business is military engines, priced mostly in sterling.    One London stockbroker, Banque Paribas Capital Markets, predicts Rolls pretax profit in 1988 will edge up 4% to #162 million from #156 million in 1987. Last year the company posted a 12% gain in net income to #134 million on a 14% revenue jump to #2.06 billion.    U.S. airlines' sudden interest in the 757 is a plus, at last. Rolls began work in the late 1970s on the 757 engine, but airlines focused on smaller jets to serve their developing hub-and-spoke networks with frequent flights. Now, with crowded airports and skies, they need the 757's larger seating capacity.    When American first ordered the 757 it selected Pratt engines, but later canceled the order. In choosing Rolls this time, American noted the low noise level and high efficiency and reliability of the Rolls engine. Pratt, perhaps smarting, privately suggests low prices had something to do with it. &quot;We don't think {Rolls's} profit motive is as strong as an American company's,&quot; says one Pratt executive. Sir Ralph brushes aside the notion, saying he could snipe at Pratt's recent sale for engines to power United Airlines 757s -- &quot;if I were snide.&quot;    ---    The Jet Engine Battle   Sales (in billions)1     1986     1987   General Electric         $6.0     $6.8   Pratt andamp; Whitney           5.5      5.7   Rolls-Royce 2             2.7      3.2   Profits (in millions)1   General Electric         $869     $940   Pratt andamp; Whitney 3         506      606   Rolls-Royce 2             451      579   1 -- Figures cover civil and military engines only   2 -- Converted from pounds at current rate   3 -- Excludes restructuring costs   Note: GE figures include engines made in a joint venture with Snecma of France. </TEXT></DOC>
