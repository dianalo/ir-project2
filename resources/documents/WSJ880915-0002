Both the dollar and U.S. bond prices surged early in yesterday's session as the Commerce Department reported a $9.53 billion trade gap in July, the lowest in nearly four years. But bonds later gave back most of their early gains because of concern over higher oil prices.    At one stage early yesterday, prices of Treasury bonds were up as much as 1 1/4 points, or $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount, from Tuesday's closing levels. They wound up the day, though, with gains of only about 1/4 of a point from the previous day. The yield on the latest 30-year government bonds fell to 8.97% from 9% late Tuesday. The yield on Treasury notes due in about five years dropped to 8.59% from 8.63%, and rates on short-term Treasury bills also edged lower.    The July trade figure came in far below the $11.5 billion that many analysts had expected and June's revised deficit of $13.22 billion. Moreover, it was even lower than the most optimistic estimate of 15 economists surveyed earlier this week by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.    Some investment managers argued that the trade figure was a fluke and proves only how extraordinarily volatile the numbers can be from month to month. Fears also persist that inflation will accelerate, prompting the Federal Reserve to tighten credit further.    &quot;I still expect rates to drift up again,&quot; said John E. Haupert, treasurer of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.    But others reacted enthusiastically to the trade report. Zane Brown, a managing director of Equitable Capital Management Corp., which manages about $24 billion of fixed-income securities, said reports such as this make &quot;very constructive markets.&quot; He expects further declines in interest rates, adding that he wouldn't be surprised to see 30-year Treasury bond yields fall another 1/4 percentage point to 8 3/4% &quot;within a month.&quot;    Mr. Brown says many portfolio managers have been positioned defensively, holding bond positions that are somewhat shorter in duration than their benchmark index. &quot;Getting even with that index to slightly long is going to put a fair amount of money in the market,&quot; he said.    Nevertheless, the spurt in oil prices dominated activity yesterday afternoon. Traders attributed the increase largely to the possibility of supply disruptions stemming from the massive hurricane sweeping into the Gulf of Mexico yesterday.    &quot;To a great extent, the focus has been on oil,&quot; said Joseph M. Petri, president of Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc.    Treasury Securities   Although the trade report ignited a strong bond rally early yesterday, most of the gains later evaporated as oil prices climbed.    Nevertheless, an index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. advanced for the 11th day out of the last 13. The index rose 3.16 points to 1247.51, only slightly above its low for the day of 1246.88. The high was 1256.88.    Among actively traded issues, the government's 9 1/4% bonds due in May 2018 rose 9/32 of a point to 101 18/32. The latest 10-year issue rose to 102 3/8 from 102 5/32, as its yield fell to 8.88% from 8.92%.    The yield on the latest two-year Treasury notes declined to 8.32% from 8.38%.    Among short-term rates, the rate on the latest three-month Treasury bill fell to 7.14% bid from 7.17%, while the latest six-month bill rate declined to 7.34% bid from 7.40%.    Municipal Issues   Fueled by the unexpectedly small trade deficit and strong demand for an influx of new issues, municipal bond prices climbed.    Some active issues registered gains of 1/4 to 5/8 point. Expectations of higher oil prices and a slightly disappointing seasonally adjusted 0.2% advance in August industrial production capped the early advance, but municipals were able to retain the bulk of their gains.    Underwriters quickly took advantage of slumping rates by unveiling several large new issues. Three massive issues alone -- one new money and two refundings -- injected about $948 million of bonds into the marketplace.    Among these was a $396.5 million offering by the Municipal Assistance Corp. for the City of New York, known as MAC. Under the proposed terms, the MAC offering includes bonds with yields ranging from 5.75% in 1989 to 7.698% on those bonds due in 2008. Investors greeted the offering with enthusiasm, according to lead underwriter Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.    In another refunding transaction, underwriters led by Citicorp Securities Markets Inc. tenatively priced $291.78 million various purpose general obligation bonds for the state of Washington.    The offering includes $125.1 million of bonds priced to yield from 5.75% in 1989 to 7.80% in 2009 and 2010, and $166.7 million of bonds priced to yield from 5.75% in 1989 to about 7.33% in 2001.    Elsewhere in the new-issue market, underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. tentatively priced $260.7 million of single-family mortgage revenue bonds from the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Corp. The issue was &quot;in excellent shape,&quot; according to a Shearson official.    In the secondary market, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds of 2018 were quoted late yesterday at 93 1/8 bid, up 5/8 on the day and just off the session high of 93 1/4 bid. The bonds yield about 7.79%, down from 7.85% late Tuesday.    Illustrating the extent of the market's recent strength, a month ago the Turnpike Authority's bonds were yielding 8.22%, 0.43 percentage point more than their current level.    Corporate Issues   Corporate bonds closed 1/4 to 1/2 point higher, with an unexpected narrowing in the merchandise trade deficit touching off a session of heavy trading.    The trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted $9.53 billion in July from a revised $13.22 billion in June. Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report had expected an $11.2 billion July trade gap.    In one of the larger corporate financings so far this week, underwriters led by First Boston Corp. priced a $500 million two-part offering for Sun Exploration andamp; Production Co., a unit of Sun Co.    The deal includes $250 million of notes due Sept. 15, 1998, priced at par, at a spread of 89 basis points over the benchmark Treasury 10-year note. The notes are noncallable for seven years.    There are also $250 million of debentures due Sept. 15, 2018, priced at 99.58 to yield 10.42%. The debentures, nonrefundable for 10 years, were priced at 140 basis points above the Treasury 8 7/8 issue of 2017.    A sinking fund retires 5% of the debentures annually beginning in the 11th year.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   After a sharp early rally, mortgage securities gave up most of their gains as active issues ended 1/8 to 1/4 point higher.    Some traders tied heavy purchases of mortgage securities shortly after the opening to investors concerned about missing the rally in the bond market.    As the bond market moved higher following the trade report, a number of investors bought mortgage issues because their portfolios were underweighted in mortgages relative to major bond market indexes, or because they were holding substantial cash positions, traders said.    The September Ginnie Mae 9% issue closed at 94 30/32, up 6/32, after touching a high of 95 14/32. The September 10% issue ended at 100 5/8, up 7/32, and Freddie Mac's 10% securities at 100 6/32, also up 7/32.    The yield advantage of mortgage issues above intermediate Treasurys finished wider on the day as the Treasury market eased from highs and mortgage investors took profits.    Ginnie Mae's 10% issue was yielding 10.03% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note widened two basis points to 116 basis points.    In the asset-backed market, J.C. Penney Co. made its first offering of securities backed by credit-card receivables. The $250 million issue was priced at 99 3/4 to yield 9.13%, 68 basis points above the Treasury three-year note. First Boston Corp. led the underwriting group.    The J.C. Penney issue marked the third large credit-card offering during the past week. Sears Roebuck andamp; Co. and MNC Financial Inc. each made $500 million offerings last week.    Two unusual asset and mortgage offerings are due for pricing by the week's end.    Chemical Bank plans to make the first offering of securities backed by loans on pleasure boats. The $381 million, to be underwritten by the bank and First Boston Corp., is expected to be priced at 80 to 85 basis points above a Treasury issue with a roughly 2.4-year maturity.    The Veterans Administration is scheduled to sell $143 million of securities backed by &quot;Vendee&quot; loans. The four-class offer, through American Housing Trust II, also will be underwritten by a First Boston group.    As with the prior Vendee sale earlier this year, there will be no government or VA guarantee on the securities. Credit support will consist only of a large subordinated class amounting to 39% of the issue.    Vendee loans are made by the VA to facilitate the sale of properties obtained by the agency after foreclosures on VA-guaranteed mortgages. Because defaults occur in depressed economic areas, the Vendee aren't of high credit quality, resulting in the large subordinated class needed for the expected Triple-A ratings from Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    The typical size of a subordinated class for a Triple-A-rated mortgage securities issue is 10% or less.    Foreign Bonds   West German government bond prices rose early yesterday but later retreated to finish with small gains. British government issues also edged higher, while Japanese bonds ended lower.    The West German government's benchmark 6 3/4% issue of 1998 ended at 100.85, up 0.30 point from the previous day, to yield 6.628%. The gains, however, were only half those reached just before the U.S. trade figures for July were announced. Corporate bonds were up as much as 1/4 point on the day.    In London, prices of British government bonds, or gilts, ended with small gains even though the British pound declined against the dollar after the release of the U.S. trade data.    Traders are bracing for bad news Friday with the release of August's inflation data. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson warned that the figures will show a &quot;significant increase&quot; due to recent mortgage rate rises. Economists had already been widely forecasting a rise to 5.3% to 5.6% from 4.8% annual inflation in July.    Among active issues, the benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% issue 2003/2007 rose 6/32 to 113 31/32 to yield 9.90%. Among shorter-term issues, the Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 1991 rose 1/32 to 102 7/32 to yield 10.61% while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 was up 2/32 to 107 to yield 10.44%.    Eurodollar issues rose about 3/8 point in 10-year maturities on news of the U.S. trade deficit. The data may also boost near-term Eurodollar bond participation by drawing back some European investors who had been wary of the market, analysts in London said.    Amid the volatility, only two fixed-coupon Eurodollar bond issues were launched. Morgan Stanley International led $200 million offerings on behalf of both GMAC Canada and Finnish Export Credit Ltd., Finland's export finance agency.    Separately, Mitsubishi Electric Corp., the Japanese electronics and electrical equipment maker, issued a well-received $300 million in Eurobonds with equity-purchase warrants, via Daiwa Europe Ltd.    Japanese government bond prices ended slightly lower on the day in light activity, ahead of the release of the U.S. trade data. Thursday is a holiday in Japan, eliminating the early chance to react to the U.S. data during Tokyo hours.    Many Japanese dealers thought the July U.S. trade deficit would be even higher than the $11.2 billion average estimate of 15 economists surveyed earlier this week by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.    The Japanese government's benchmark No. 105, 5% issue due 1997 closed at a yield of 5.16% in the interdealer market, up 3.5 basis points on the day. The range on the session was 5.135% to 5.175%. The closing yield represented a price of 98.99, down 0.22 yen per 100 yen face value. </TEXT></DOC>
