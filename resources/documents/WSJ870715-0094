Guinn plans to take early retirement next year as chairman and chief executive officer.    As part of the major management change, the San Francisco-based regional Bell holding company also placed in line as Mr. Guinn's heir apparent Sam L. Ginn, the chief architect of the company's unregulated, or non-telephone, operations. Effective Sept. 1, Mr. Ginn will succeed Mr. Guinn as president and assume the new post of chief operating officer, Pacific Telesis said. Currently, Mr. Ginn is vice chairman.    In addition, Theodore J. Saenger is taking early retirement from his post as president and chief executive officer of Bell Cos., the holding company for Pacific Telesis's local telephone concerns, Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell.    Securities analysts said the company is losing a visionary whose tenure was marked by a remarkable financial rebound.    Mr. Guinn, 54 years old, had planned for years that he would retire at age 55 to pursue personal interests, the company said. The 33-year veteran of the old Bell system became Pacific Telesis's top officer Jan. 1, 1984, when the seven so-called Baby Bells were spun off from Ma Bell in 1984.    Mr. Ginn, 50, began his career with the Bell System 26 years ago. In addition to his current post as vice chairman, he also is president and chief executive of PacTel Corp., the unit encompassing Pacific Telesis' unregulated operations. &quot;What his rise tells you is that they know their future growth doesn't so much lie in traditional phone service as it does in enhancement of that service and diversification,&quot; said Jack Grubman, analyst with PaineWebber Securities Inc.    Pacific Telesis named C. Lee Cox, 46, currently vice president marketing for the Pacific Bell unit, to succeed Mr. Ginn. Named to succeed the 59-year-old Mr. Saenger was Philip J. Quigley, 45, the currently executive vice president of the PacTel Corp. unit. Mr. Quigley will be succeeded by Thomas G. Cross, 46, who currently is Pacific Telesis's vice president and treasurer. </TEXT></DOC>
