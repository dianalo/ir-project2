The developer and operator of alternative energy plants said each partner will hold 50% of the development rights in the project, designed to produce about 45,000 kilowatts of electricity for sale to a local utility. Steam from the plant will be sold for use in enhanced oil recovery operations nearby, and some of the petroleum products recovered will be burned to help fire the boilers.    Closely held Sunlaw, a Seal Beach, Calif., energy project developer and operator, has been responsible for development work to date, Bonneville said. Construction is scheduled to begin in January, with completion set for December 1989. </TEXT></DOC>
