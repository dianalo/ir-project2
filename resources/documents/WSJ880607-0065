The educational establishment (teacher unions, state education departments, school boards and administrators, and colleges of education) has seized on concerns about these matters to demand more funding for education. The presidential hopefuls will have a lot more to say and promise on this score before this year's race mercifully ends.    Virtually none of the debate, however, has focused on a shocking trend in American education -- the dramatic decline in educational productivity. In 1950, our public elementary and secondary schools educated 16.5% of the nation's population at a cost of barely 2% of the nation's output; in 1986, it took 3.5% of the nation's output to educate the same proportion of the citizenry. In constant-dollar terms, expenditures per pupil more than tripled.    While in 1940 there were more than 29 students for each classroom teacher in the public schools, in 1986 there were fewer than 18. If non-classroom members of the instructional staff are included, the trend is even more pronounced.    Measuring educational &quot;output&quot; is difficult, as the very body of knowledge needed to be disseminated has broadened dramatically. Still, the human mind can absorb only so much, and it is probably not too far-fetched to assume that the teacher today teaches roughly the same amount of material (even though different in content) as 50 years ago. Given declining test scores, even this may be an optimistic assumption.    Under this assumption, the chart shows what has happened to &quot;output&quot; per instructional staff member between 1940 and 1986, compared with output per worker in the economy as a whole. While the output of workers outside education more than doubled, that of teachers fell as class sizes grew smaller and the number of non-teaching professional staff grew.    Some teachers would demur, arguing that they can provide so much more individualized attention in today's smaller classes than could their counterparts in 1940, and that the quality of the learning experience has improved. Yet a recent study released by the Education Department confirms what several other investigations have noted -- the relationship between class size and learning is very weak. Japanese students do much better than Americans in math -- yet the average class size in Japan approaches 40, about twice the U.S. level.    While the reasons for the productivity decline are no doubt complex, three factors are of unquestionable importance:   --Monopoly power. For many consumers of elementary and secondary education in the U.S., there is no real choice of schools. Private schools either are unavailable or too expensive, and public school districts do not compete with one another for students.    Even within school districts, parents usually are not allowed any choice. Schools have no meaningful economic incentives to improve the quality of their product, or provide it at lower cost. Monopolists incur higher average costs than competitive firms under most conditions, and that principle applies to education as well. Private schools, which face competition for students and need tuition revenues to survive, spent 36% less per pupil than public schools in 1985.    --Third-party payments. For most goods and services, payments are made by the consumers to the producers -- the two parties to the transaction. In public education, a third party -- government -- makes the payments necessary to provide the service. Consumers have little incentive to demand efficiency, since they are not paying for it. Similarly, producers can increase the wealth of their employees and make their customers happy by lobbying for ever-larger amounts of money from the general taxpayer. The move away from dominant reliance on local government funding probably has aggravated the problem.    --Seeking something for nothing. Taking advantage of the lack of much monitoring of costs, teachers relentlessly demand higher salaries and fringe benefits, smaller class sizes (to make the job easier), aides, administrative support, etc. They become &quot;rent-seekers&quot; -- i.e., attempt to increase their income without a trade-off of any added work.    In doing this, they are no different from many others who seek &quot;rents&quot; from government, and certainly there are many dedicated teachers who work very long hours for very modest pay. Still, teacher groups (affiliates of the National Education Association more than those of the American Federation of Teachers) get legislatures to restrict entry into the field by imposing dubious certification requirements involving lots of methods courses devoid of meaningful intellectual content.    The lawmakers impose minimum salary and maximum teaching-load restrictions, constrain boards of education from firing incompetents, and restrict the use of merit pay. The unions generously contribute to the re-election campaigns of legislators who support the teachers' special interests and work against those who have the courage to oppose their costly policies.    Despite union opposition, in the past few years several states have removed some of the restrictions on staffing and pay. While there have been some positive results, much remains to be done.    Paying government education subsidies to consumers (students -- or their parents) rather than school districts would reduce monopoly power and the emphasis on third-party payments. Parents then could approach education the way they would any major consumer purchase. The time has come for a major federal experiment using the voucher approach.    If this still is considered too radical, the federal government could dispense aid in a way that promotes reform. It could give generously to states that emulate Minnesota in allowing students free choice among all public-school options. It could &quot;bribe&quot; states to end such cost-increasing provisions as elaborate certification requirements. Bonus payments could be made to states whose public schools increase productivity without any decline in student learning as measured through standardized tests.    Of course, educators will scream if we try any of these things, but given the sharp increase in educational costs resulting from falling labor productivity, it is good policy and probably even good politics to start standing up to the Educational Establishment.    ---   Mr. Vedder is a professor of economics at Ohio University and a member of the Athens, Ohio, school board.    ---                     Labor Productivity                                           1940       1986    Public primary and secondary    school instructional staff             100         62    All civilian workers                   100        208    Source: U.S. Dept. of Commerce; Council of Economic Advisors</TEXT></DOC>
