Richard Beckler told a federal court hearing that independentcounsel Lawrence Walsh violated his office's own procedures byhiring Dan Webb in September to head the prosecution team againstPoindexter, who was President Reagan's national security adviser.   Another member of the Poindexter prosecution team, Howard Pearl,a longtime colleague of Webb, was hired a few weeks ago.   At the hearing, Webb disclosed he plans to call 46 witnesses inthe government's case, including former National Security Councilaide Oliver North, who in May was convicted of three felonies inthe Iran-Contra scandal.   Webb also said many of the same witnesses from the North casewill be called when Poindexter is put on trial. Webb did notelaborate. The witnesses at North's trial included former NationalSecurity Adviser Robert McFarlane, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., andformer Attorney General Edwin Meese III.   North worked in 1985 and 1986 for Poindexter, who is chargedwith conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two countsof making false statements. The alleged crimes occurred inconnection with North's secret resupply operation to the NicaraguanContras and in regard to a shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran in1985 assisted by the CIA.   Walsh set up elaborate regulations in 1987 to insulate his triallawyers from being exposed to the immunized congressional testimonyof Iran-Contra figures, including Poindexter.   Webb, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago, has been in private lawpractice and so has undoubtedly been tainted by Poindexter'snationally televised testimony, Beckler suggested.   ``This almost borders on bad faith,'' Beckler told U.S. DistrictCourt Judge Harold Greene, who has set Jan. 22 to startPoindexter's trial.   ``Here you have a prosecutor who has built a Chinese wall toblock off the ... taint and then he has gone out and hired peopleto go around the Chinese wall or go through it or under it,''Beckler complained. ``It makes a complete mockery of the process.''   Webb has filed an affidavit saying he didn't watch or readPoindexter's immunized congressional testimony.   Webb offered to undergo questioning by Beckler in Greene'scourtroom on the question of exposure to immunized testimony andGreene indicated he would take Webb up on the offer.   A Supreme Court ruling says that no portion of a criminal casemay be derived from a witness's immunized testimony.</TEXT></DOC>
