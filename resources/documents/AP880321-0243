The sultan reclined on a carpet by an open fire in the darkpalace, slowly spinning a silver cylinder of snuff in his hand.Across from him on lawn chairs sat a reporter and producer from theBritish Broadcasting Co., nervously negotiating.   They explained their plan to an old, white-robed interpreter whotranslated it from French for the sultan and his retinue. Thesultan's black eyes, the only part of his head not concealed by anabundant turban, revealed nothing but inscrutable reserve.   After a while he raised his hand and discussion of detailsceased between the BBC and a barefoot caravaner. He approved 30camels and agreed to outfit the caravan for a reasonable price _and agreed to be interviewed on camera for the trade route film.   ``Thirty camels can go now without danger,'' the sultan says.``It is no longer necessary to travel in large groups forprotection.''   The danger facing Agadez these days, he says, is not other men,but nature.   ``It is getting drier, the water table is falling and we havenot had a good rain in two years,'' he says. ``It is difficult tosay exactly what is happening.   ``We have enough water for the moment for our 30,000 people andthere is enough fodder, but any further loss of pasture and therewill be no livestock left. I don't know about will happen to thepeople.''   The spread of the Sahara is the biggest problem in Agadez, inthe region, in all of Niger. Desertification and the environmentwas the top priority listed by the new government when it took overin November. The new chief of state is Ali Seibou, the third man tolead Niger since it gained independence from France three decadesago.   Col. Seibou, leader of the Nigerien military, took over Nov. 17from President Seyna Kountche, who died in a Paris hospital of abrain tumor. Seibou immediately was chosen to head the seven-manruling Supreme Military Council.   Already known for his leadership in efficiently distributingfood throughout Niger during the 1984 famine, Seibou increased hispopularity by releasing about 200 political prisoners and reducingpolice presence in Niamey, the capital. Articles mildly critical ofthe government began appearing in the press. The atmosphere seemedlooser, people said.   The transition of power was especially smooth when compared toother West African nations, where violent coups d'etat often markthe change in government. Niger's reputation for stability has beenstrengthened in international circles, including the United States.   International affairs, even national ones, receive littleattention in Agadez, where there are only a couple of televisionsets and one plane a week lands on the sand-swept airstrip neartown. Tradition is what matters.   Even the way of saying hello on the street is rooted in theSahara's golden age. The Tuareg have a complicated and courteousway of greeting each other, exchanging several phrases beforeconversation begins. Softly spoken, ritualistic phrases, whicheveryone knows by heart, sometimes go on for a minute or more.   ``Salum alaikum,'' they begin. Peace to you.   ``Alaikum wa salam.'' Peace to you too.   ``Yak lo bas.'' No evil to you.   ``Lo bas.'' No evil.   ``Lo bas. Hamdullah.'' No evil, thanks to God.   As the phrases continue, the men look each other over. Theritual was useful for sizing up a stranger on the desert,identifying his tribe.   Abdou, sporting a Georgia Historical Society T-shirt given tohim by a foreign friend, thinks the greeting is old-fashioned. Buthe respects the ancient traditions, knowing that this is whatbrings the tourists to his grandfather's shop.   ``You want to go see the camel market outside town?'' he asks avisitor. ``I can borrow my brother's motorcycle and take youthere.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 3</NOTE></DOC>
