The treaty, which establishes a common market, is viewedby Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Western officialsas a prerequisite for reforming the nation's economy andreceiving Western financial assistance.</LP><TEXT>   Soviet news agencies said Ukrainian Prime Minister VitoldFokin made the announcement at a Kremlin meeting with Mr.Gorbachev and leaders of other republics yesterday. Mr. Fokininitialed a draft of the treaty in September but backed awayfrom signing the final text after his action provoked a stormof protest in the Ukraine, which is to hold a referendum onindependence Dec. 1.   It isn't clear whether the substantial number of deputiesin the Ukrainian Parliament who opposed signing the documentscan block the move. But Mr. Fokin's statement was greetedwith dismay by some in Kiev, with one official saying itwould be &quot;like signing a death sentence.&quot;   If the signing does go ahead, it would be a significantvictory for Mr. Gorbachev, who has pressured the Ukraine tojoin the pact and drop some of its more nationalist policies.That didn't stop Ukrainian legislators yesterday fromapproving laws setting up the Ukraine's own National Guard,consisting initially of 33,000 former Soviet InteriorMinistry troops. A Ukrainian border-troops unit also wasestablished.</TEXT></DOC>
