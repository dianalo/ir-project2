The threeApproved Testing Materials (ATMs) are borosilicate glasses based uponthe MCC-76-68 glass composition. One radioisotope was added to form eachATM. The radioisotopes added to form ATM-2, ATM-3, and ATM-4 were {sup241}Am, {sup 237}Np, and {sup 239}Pu, respectively. Each of the ATM lotswas produced in a nominal lot size of 450 g from feed stock melted ina nitrogen-atmosphere glove box at 1200{degree}C in a platinum crucible.Each ATM was then cast into bars. Analyzed compositions of these glassesare listed. The nonradioactive elements were analyzed by inductivelycoupled argon plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP), and the radioisotopeanalyses were done by alpha energy analysis. Results are discussed. 7refs., 3 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
