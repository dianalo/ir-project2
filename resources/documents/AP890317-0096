SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Money has been raised to keep the Landsatearth-sensing satellites going for at least four months, theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told Congress onFriday.   The satellites had been threatened with shutdown on March 31because of a lack of money, but passing the hat among agencies thatuse information from Landsat has generated enough pledges to keepthe satellites operating.   The Defense Department pledged $3 million; $1.6 million will comefrom satellite operating receipts; $1 million from the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration; $500,000 from the InteriorDepartment, and $300,000 from the Department of Agriculture, saidDr. William E. Evans, Commerce under secrtetary for oceans andatmospheres.   The Landsat satellites, which collect information used inmapping, locating mineral resources and assessing agricultural andother land features, are operated by the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration, which is under Evans.   The budget problem was caused by the fact that the two satellitesare past their anticipated lifetimes and planners had not expectedthem to last this long. A replacement is to be launched in a year orso, and that has been funded.   Asked what will happen when the new financing runs out in fourmonths, Evans told the House Appropriations commerce subcommitteethat he is not sure, but he wants to be cautious about committinglarge amounts of money. ``Nature may solve the problem by shuttingdown'' the satellites, he commented.   Evans' comments came at a hearing on the proposed $1.06 billionbudget for NOAA, which he said will allow the agency to concentrateon three primary areas: coastal zone research and development,modernization of the National Weather Service and research intoglobal climate change.</TEXT></DOC>
