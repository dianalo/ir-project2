Stock funds gained 31.2% in the year through Dec. 26,nicely ahead of the 26.6% gain by Standard andamp; Poor's 500-StockIndex. Stock funds also did far better than both taxable bondfunds, which were up 17.2%, and money funds, which eked outreturns of just 5.7%.</LP><TEXT>   For mutual fund investors, last year was a welcometurnaround after 1990's drubbing, when stock funds had theirworst performance since 1974 and taxable bond funds posted anaverage gain of just 4.3%.   With the turnaround in fund performance came a flood ofmoney from investors. &quot;Despite the general economicenvironment, and the virtual collapse of consumer confidencein the last few months, interest in mutual funds&quot; is atrecord levels, notes Avi Nachmany, an analyst with StrategicInsight, a New York mutual fund consulting firm.   The big money went to bond mutual funds. According to theInvestment Company Institute, $63.4 billion flooded into bondfunds during the first 11 months of 1991, the best showingfor bond fund sales since 1986.   Bond funds gained assets as yield-hungry investors shiftedcash out of money market funds and certificates of deposit,which now yield less than 5%, and into bond funds, many ofwhich are still paying 7% and above.   The big beneficiaries were what Mr. Nachmany calls &quot;lowvolatility funds,&quot; such as short-term bond funds, adjustablerate mortgage funds and short-term global bond funds. Thesefunds offer higher yields than money market funds, butshareholders also have to put up with modest share pricefluctuations. In 1991, &quot;we estimate that those fundsaccounted for almost half of the money coming into bondfunds,&quot; says Mr. Nachmany.   Stock funds, meanwhile, pulled in a record $31 billion inthe first 11 months of 1991. That amount is safely ahead ofthe previous record year, 1986, when stock funds attracted$21.9 billion.   Though stock funds on average performed well, the gainsweren't even. Funds specializing in smaller stocks, thosewith stock market values of $1 billion and below, outpacedcompetitors that stuck with larger-company stocks.Small-company stock funds returned 43.9%, compared with 31.2%for the average stock fund tracked by Lipper AnalyticalServices, a Summit, N.J., fund research firm.   But even among small-stock funds, there were sharpdifferences in performance. Funds that buy growth stocks,such as Montgomery Small Cap Fund and Oberweis EmergingGrowth Fund, posted gains of as much as 70% and above.   It was a less glorious year for small-company value funds,such as Pennsylvania Mutual Fund and Southeastern AssetManagement Small-Cap Fund, both of which look for stocks thatare cheap relative to assets, cash flow or current earnings.Some of these funds posted gains of less than 30%.   Value funds that buy large and medium-sized company stocksalso did poorly in 1991. After rallying in late 1990 andearly 1991, value funds stalled, and many funds finished theyear with disappointing results. Well-regarded value fundssuch as Gabelli Asset Fund, Mutual Shares Fund and WindsorFund all lagged behind the average stock fund tracked byLipper Analytical.   Funds that buy large-company growth stocks, which havebeen on a tear since 1989, had another strong year in 1991.Buoyed by its hefty holdings of growth stocks, Fidelity'sMagellan Fund, the country's largest mutual fund with $19billion in assets, soared 36.4% during 1991.   &quot;My feeling is that things that worked well {in 1991} willcontinue to work well over the next year,&quot; says KennethGregory, editor of L/G No-Load Fund Analyst, a San Francisconewsletter. &quot;I think small will do better than big, andgrowth will do better than value.&quot;   Among funds that specialize in the stocks of a singleindustry sector, the big winners in 1991 were health andbiotechnology sector funds, up 66%. Funds specializing infinancial services stocks also did well, gaining 55.4%.   High-yielding junk-bond funds, which got pummelled in 1989and 1990, were the top-performing category of bond fund lastyear, with a gain of 35.1% in the first 11 months of 1991.But investors remained leery of junk funds. During the first11 months of 1991, investors put a paltry $2.1 billion intothese funds, just 3% of all money going into bond mutualfunds.   Among publicly traded funds, last year's hottest sellerswere municipal-bond funds. According to Lipper Analytical, 37publicly traded funds were launched in the first 11 months of1991, raising $8.3 billion. Thirty of those funds weremunicipal-bond funds, together pulling in $6.7 billion.   ---                    How Different Types                   Of Mutual Funds Fared                                                                                                                                           % CHANGE     % CHANGE                                 12/31/90 TO     12/31/89                                    12/26/91     12/31/90                                                                                                          Health/biotech.                   +66.4%        +19.35%   Financial services                +55.41        -14.88   Small co. growth                  +43.85        - 9.89   Science/technology                +39.64        - 3.13   Cap. appreciation                 +34.58        - 8.02   Growth                            +31.77        - 5.48   Real estate                       +27.45        -16.91   Convertible securities            +27.27        - 7.59   Growth andamp; income                   +25.28        - 4.48   Equity income                     +23.63        - 6.29   Balanced                          +23.35        - 0.21   Flexible portfolio                +21.11        - 0.92   Utility                           +19.93        - 1.46   Option income                     +19.04        - 3.21   Fixed income                      +17.18        + 4.26   Global                            +16.12        -10.52   Global flex. portfolio            +13.40        - 3.74   Pacific Region                    +10.89        -18.89   World income                      +10.05        +14.25   International                     + 9.76        -11.95   Environmental                     + 4.34        - 9.28   European region                   + 4.17        - 4.39   Natural resources                 + 0.97        - 7.90   Gold                              - 8.16        -22.07                                                                                                          AVERAGE GENERAL                   +31.20%       - 6.27%   EQUITY FUND                                                                                                          Source: Lipper Analytical Services                                                                                                                            1991 Mutual Fund                    Winners and Losers                                                                                                          Data are through Dec. 26, 1991                                                                                                                                                     % CHANGE                                                                                                          Ten Best Performers                                                                                                          Oppenheimer Global Bio-Tech                +107.21%   CGM Capital Development                    + 94.50   American Heritage Fund                     + 88.89   Montgomery Small Cap.                      + 88.10   Fidelity Select-Biotechnology              + 88.86   Berger One Hundred                         + 81.13   United New Concepts                        + 79.61   Oberweis Emerging Growth                   + 77.29   MFS Lifetime Emerging Growth               + 76.43                                                                                                          Ten Worst Performers                                                                                                          Strategic Gold/Minerals                    - 28.57%   Fidelity Select-Energy Service             - 25.53   Rushmore Precious Metals Index             - 24.97   Strategic Investments                      - 20.58   MetLife-State Street  Global Energy        - 19.49   Benham Gold Equities Index                 - 17.75   SunAmerica Precious Metals                 - 15.50   Strategic Silver                           - 15.46   United Services Gold Shares                - 14.75   Shearson Precious Metals                   - 14.05                                                                                                          Source: Lipper Analytical Services</TEXT></DOC>
