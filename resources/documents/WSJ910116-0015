The maker of marine, recreational and defense products,said the detector has been under development for about 10years through the Army's chemical research development andengineering center in Edgewood, Md. Five units are believedto be part of the Desert Shield deployment, Brunswick said.</LP><TEXT>   The Remote Sensing Chemical Agent Alarm, which Brunswicksaid could vastly improve warning of a chemical attack, usesinfrared technology to detect chemical agents at far greaterdistances and at vastly lower levels of concentration thanany other detector. It can detect agents at five kilometersor more, compared with a maximum of 400 meters for systemscurrently used by the Army.   The company said an initial order for 100 units has beenplaced by the Marine Corps, with delivery scheduled to beginin June 1991. A contract from the Army and additional ordersfrom the Marines are also expected.   Brunswick said troops turn on the device and point it inthe direction to be scanned -- usually upwind of theirlocation. The detector operates unattended, automatically andwithout interruption. If it detects an agent, it sounds analarm, gives a visual readout of the type of agent andindicates the direction where it was detected.</TEXT></DOC>
