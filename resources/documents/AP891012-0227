One member of the House Intelligence Committee alluded to thecongressional restrictions during debate on the appropriations billfor intelligence agencies, saying President Bush's cautiousresponse to the coup was justified in part by interference from theDemocratic Congress.   ``Who could expect this administration or any administration, orany intelligence agencies, to make gutsy decisions when we havelashed them, put them under the whip, tethered them, told them theybetter not do anything?'' said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa.   In an apparent allusion to remarks made earlier this week bySenate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.,Shuster noted that some on Capitol Hill have claimed Bush hasreceived ``everything he wanted with regard to Panama.''   ``And yet we know there are those who have gone to the WhiteHouse and threatened them with exposure (of) classifiedinformation, and said, `You dare not engage in covertoperations,''' Shuster said.   Other knowledgeable congressional sources said members of theHouse Intelligence Committee had specifically barred theadministration from exercising unspecified options that could haveyielded better inside knowledge of the Panamanian Defense Forces.   The administration had notified Congress of the options in anintelligence ``finding,'' a document required to be given toCongress before undertaking covert actions, the sources said.   Shuster mentioned no lawmakers by name, but House MinorityLeader Robert Michel, R-Ill., later called Shuster's remarkssignificant.   Referring to lawmakers critical of Bush's inaction _ a groupthat includes Boren _ Michel said there is ``plenty in the(classified) record ... to know that some of these people are goingfar beyond what they've got the right to say about theadministration's requests in the past, what was granted and whatwas denied.''   In another development, the Bush administration denied Noriega'sallegations the United States paid $1 million to rebel officers tolaunch last week's failed coup.   ``That's nonsense,'' said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.   ``Absurd,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.   ``The State Department says it's absurd, the National SecurityCouncil says there's nothing to it and I say we don't believeanything Noriega says,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid in Gulfport, Miss.   Noriega told reporters for The Los Angeles Times and The BostonGlobe in an interview Wednesday night that Panamanian investigatorsdiscovered a bank account in the name of Capt. Erick A. Murillo,one of the alleged coup leaders, with more than $1 million.   ``There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian,''Noriega was quoted as saying. ``Six zeroes. It was a million dollaraccount.''   Noriega said: ``The United States was involved before, duringand after the coup. They had to make the contacts, woo them,convince them. It's a lot of work before you've hooked the fish.But they were the hook and the useful fools were the fish.''   He also said Nicaraguan Contras delivered money and relayedmessages between U.S. officials and coup plotters.   The Bush administration has said previously that U.S. officialswere notified in advance by Panamanians involved in the coup butdid not play a part in planning it.   According to a remarks Thursday at Wichita State University inKansas by Robert Blackwill, a National Security Council staffmember and 1962 graduate of the university, the coup plotters saidthey didn't want U.S. help.   ``Indeed they said they didn't wish for their effort to betainted by American intervention,'' Blackwill said in answeringquestions after a speech.   He said the Noreiga troops that crushed the coup arrived throughthe honeycomb of streets in the densely populated center of oldPanama City. U.S. intervention would have been difficult, he said.   ``This is not putting a log over a tow path,'' he said. ``Thiswould have been the deployment of American forces in the center ofa foreign country, perhaps igniting a fight in which many civilianswould have been killed.''   The United States has admitted blocking two other routes to thecoup site.   As for the accusation that the United States used the Contras asgo-betweens, Ms. Tutwiler said, ``That's the first I've ever heardof something like that.''</TEXT></DOC>
