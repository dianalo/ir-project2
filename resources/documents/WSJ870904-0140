The tax-reform bill was sent to the upper house for final action, which is expected by Sept. 18. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's Liberal Democratic Party, whose 304 members of the 512-seat lower house voted in favor of the measure, also holds a majority in the upper house.    Japan has pledged to the U.S. that it would cut taxes as part of an effort to stimulate its economy. The U.S. has pressed Japan to spur domestic demand so that it imports more and narrows its wide trade surplus.    However, there is some question as to how much the proposed tax cuts will contribute to boosting the Japanese economy, since they will be offset to some degree by the new tax on savings accounts.    The bill passed by the lower house yesterday would raise the minimum taxable income to 1.5 million yen ($10,670) from 500,000 yen and reduce the number of tax brackets to 12 from 15. Interest on small savings accounts would be taxed at 20%, although exemptions would be retained for people over age 65 and the physically handicapped.    Mr. Nakasone earlier this year sought to include a 5% sales tax in a tax-reform package, but that proposal was withdrawn after it prompted an unprecedented public outcry that was blamed for LDP losses in local elections in April. Some opposition leaders believe Mr. Nakasone plans to reintroduce a sales-tax proposal after parliament takes final action on the measure passed by the lower house yesterday.    ---   Minister Coming to the U.S.    TOKYO -- Hajime Tamura, Japan's minister of international trade and industry, will make his second trip to Washington in three months in an attempt to head off protectionist legislation.    Mr. Tamura will leave Tuesday, pending approval from Japan's parliament. He is scheduled to meet with Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, Treasury Secretary James Baker and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, a ministry official said. </TEXT></DOC>
