Bennett andbudget director Richard Darman are ``apart by more than a couple ofhundred million dollars'' on spending to fight drugs in 1991 andPresident Bush may settle the dispute, an administration officialsays.   ``It's a big enough gap that it's likely to have to go to thepresident,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The recently approved anti-drug budget for the 1990 fiscal yeartotaled $8.8 billion, which Congress had boosted by $900 millionover Bush's request of $7.9 billion.   ``I'd expect to see a real increase'' in 1991, not just anadjustment for inflation, the official said in an interview Monday.   But how much has not been determined, said the source, whorefused to provide details on how much is being sought by Bennett,director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and howmuch is sought by Darman, director of the Office of Management andBudget.   ``Bennett and Darman are apart by more than couple of hundredmillion dollars,'' the official said. ``It may end up going to thepresident to get things sorted out. Hard to know when.''   Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton said, ``This is the time of yearwhen lots of agency heads and Cabinet secretaries are talking toDarman, occasionally in strong terms.''   Meanwhile, Bennett's office is continuing work on what is beingreferred to among officials as ``Strategy Two,'' the update on thenational drug control strategy Bush presented Sept. 5. The update,like the original strategy, was required by Congress.   Hamilton said the updated strategy will add detail to someareas, focus on several anti-drug plans being employed around thecountry that are working and will get into specifics on proposedbudgets.   Expected to be included are the designations of cities or areasconsidered ``high-intensity drug trafficking areas'' that would beeligible for additional federal resources, both in money andpersonnel.   Published reports have said the areas to be designated in theupcoming strategy are Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Houston and thesouthwest border, but officials in Bennett's office say no finaldecisions have been made.   ``The conversations in reference to high-intensity drugtrafficking areas are still ongoing,'' said Reggie Walton, the drugoffice's associate director for state and local affairs.   ``I have thoughts in my mind what areas stand at the top of thelist,'' said Walton, who took the lead on determining the criteriafor designating the targeted areas.   In the current fiscal year, only $25 million total has beenallocated from the federal budget for such areas, but that couldincrease by $20 million to $21 million with money coming out of thefederal asset forfeiture fund, Walton said. That fund containsrevenue from assets seized from drug traffickers.   The second administration official said even the higher amount``is not that much money to begin with. Los Angeles spent $2billion in the drug war in L.A. County. We're looking at dividingthis money up among four, five, six, seven areas. What can you dowith this money? Obviously, we'll be looking at more money later.''   Walton would not say how much money he would seek in the 1991budget for the high-intensity drug trafficking areas.   The federal effort to crack down on drugs in the nation'scapital alone will cost about $97 million, Bennett has said.However, that includes money for three drug treatment centers and anew jail for the District of Columbia still in the planning stages.   Walton said some places designated as high-intensity drugtrafficking areas could get computers to enhance targeting ofmoney-laundering operations, while others may need more prosecutorsor law enforcement agents.</TEXT></DOC>
