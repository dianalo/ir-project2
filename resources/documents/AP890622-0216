Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell mainly from the GulfCoast to the middle Atlantic Coast and southern sections of theGreat Lakes region.   Flood or flash flood watches remained in effect for sections ofAlabama, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, WestVirginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York state.   In Tennessee, Gov. Ned McWherter requested federal disaster aidfor Rhea County, where $400,000 in damage to flooded homes andbusinesses was reported. Numerous recreation areas in the state wereunder water.   The Tennessee Valley Authority was hindered during the rainbecause it did not have its vast reservoir system drawn down, notsurprising since this is the wettest June since TVA was created 56years ago.   Average June rainfall across the river valley has been 7.55inches through Thursday morning, compared to a normal average ofjust under 3 inches for the entire month, TVA said. So far this yearthe valley has gotten 34.29 inches of rain, about 3 inches belowrainfall for all of 1988 _ compared with an average of 26.58 throughthe end of the month in a normal year.   In Alabama, floods have caused at least $2 million in damage tocrops and homes, officials said Thursday.   However, the rain has helped replenish Alabama's groundwatersupplies, depleted by two straight years of drought.   ``Over most of the state, the water levels have completelyrecovered from the drought we had last summer,'' said James D.Moore, director of the water division of the Geological Survey ofAlabama in Tuscaloosa.   Unofficial reports indicated 6 to nearly 7 inches of rain fellThursday morning on eastern Montgomery County in parchedsouthwestern Iowa.   ``The old ground sucked that up like you wouldn't believe. Ithadn't seen it in a while, and it took advantage of it,'' saidMontgomery County Sheriff Marvin Meggison.   Reports of a dousing in western Iowa apparently convincedcommodity traders that severely dry conditions there were easing,and corn and soybean futures prices closed sharply lower on theChicago Board of Trade.   Along the Licking River in central Ohio, two families wereevacuated at Newark when the water reached its 17-foot flood stage.At Utica, about 10 miles north of Newark, firefighters andvolunteers piled up sandbags on the south side of the city in anattempt to hold back the river, authorities said.   Storms also raised several rivers in southeastern Michigan aboveflood stage Thursday, authorities said.   In addition, a number of arriving and departing morning flightsat Detroit Metropolitan Airport were delayed by dense fog, airtraffic manager Jerry Linton said.   Elsewhere, there were showers over eastern Colorado, the TexasPanhandle western Oklahoma, and western and central Kansas.   Low-temperature records for the date were set in Casper, Wyo.,where it was 34 degrees; Cheyenne, Wyo., 35; Rapid City, S.D., 39;Scottsbluff, Neb., 38; and Winslow, Ariz., 45.   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 52degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 105 at Palm Springs,Calif. Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 27 degrees atCraig, Colo.   Friday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstormsacross much of the nation east of the Rockies, with thunderstormsespecially from southern Louisiana to Alabama, over North Carolina,and in the upper Ohio Valley, and showers most numerous fromnortheastern Minnesota to upper Michigan and northern lowerMichigan. Showers also were forecast over the northern Rockies, withshowers most numerous in western Montana.   Highs only in the 60s were predicted in the northern Rockies; inthe 60s and 70s in southern New England, along much of the PacificCoast, and across the northern and central high Plains to upperMichigan; above 90 across Florida and southern Georgia, and from thelower Mississippi Valley to southern New Mexico and the valleys anddeserts of California; and above 100 in the desert Southwest.</TEXT></DOC>
