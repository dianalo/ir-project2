King, chairman of King World Productions Inc.: Our firm represents the cabdriver whom Mr. King assaulted. This man suffered permanent injury that affected his vision and he is under treatment at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami. It is important that the record be set straight. When Mr. King states that he is &quot;glad no one was hurt,&quot; I think he means that he is glad that he was not hurt by the court system, because he certainly hurt the man he assaulted.    John E.
