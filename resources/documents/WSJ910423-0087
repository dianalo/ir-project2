The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chose Fleet's bid overBank of Boston Corp. and BankAmerica Corp., saying that thewinning offer will mean the least cost to the federal bankinsurance fund.</LP><TEXT>   The victory underscores the emergence of Fleet, once arelatively small bank based in Providence, R.I., as thelargest bank in New England. And it marks a major move by KKR-- best known for its takeovers of industrial companies --into banking as an investor.   Fleet will pay $625 million for Bank of New England -- acapital infusion of $500 million in the failed bank and a$125 million premium payment to the FDIC, which seized thebank in January. The cost of the federally assisted bailoutto the FDIC is expected to be $2.5 billion, about 10% higherthan the amount initially estimated by the FDIC.   FDIC Chairman William Seidman emphasized that KKR will beonly &quot;a passive investor&quot; in the acquisition by Fleet andwon't have any control over the bank. However, KKR'sinvestment marks one of the first times that a non-bankingconcern has been allowed to inject substantial capital into amajor U.S. bank.   People familiar with the Bank of New England sale sayKKR's investment was carefully structured -- and renegotiatedseveral times -- to comply with a web of federal regulationsthat severely limit bank ownership by industrial concerns.The willingness of the FDIC to permit the investmentillustrates its desire to attract a new source of capital forbanking. &quot;We are delighted to see this new money coming intothe banking system,&quot; Mr. Seidman said.   Indeed, a KKR executive commented: &quot;We plan to do more ofthis, and we think a lot of other {financial and industrialgroups} will be encouraged by it.&quot;   The participation of KKR in the transaction is likely toattract more political attention. Earlier this month, Rep.John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy andCommerce Committee, warned regulators that the Fleet/KKR bidcould violate current laws barring commercial companies fromowning banks. However, federal officials concluded thereweren't any violations. &quot;KKR is really performing aninvestment banker function,&quot; said Comptroller of the CurrencyRobert L. Clarke, an FDIC board member.   Moreover, the FDIC's decision might be questioned onfinancial grounds. After its announcement, rumors began tocirculate that BankAmerica had offered a better price -- acash premium of $237 million compared with Fleet's premium of$125 million, made up of $100 million in preferred stock andjust $25 million in cash.   Without acknowledging the difference, an FDIC officialsaid the premium was just the starting point for evaluating abid. Each bid contained conditions and contingencies that hadto be priced out by the FDIC staff. Comptroller of theCurrency Clarke, said: &quot;In the final analysis it was prettyclear&quot; that Fleet had submitted the best bid, although there&quot;was a relatively narrow range&quot; among the bids.   The victory by Fleet is a setback for BankAmerica, whichwas hoping to take a major step toward becoming a nationwidebank. But BankAmerica has indicated that it plans to pursuebanks in other parts of the country. The decision also was ablow for Bank of Boston, which had hoped to combine itsstrength in commercial lending with Bank of New England'sstrong consumer franchise to overcome its own financialproblems resulting from the region's real-estate slump.   Fleet, with assets of $32.6 billion and banks in most ofNew England and New York, will become a regional powerhousewith the acquisition. Bank of New England has assets of $20billion, although the FDIC initially will assume about $5.5billion in bad assets.   As in many federally assisted bank takeovers in the past,the transaction is largely risk-free for Fleet. During thenext three years, Fleet can turn over any additional troubledassets to the FDIC with only small penalties.   &quot;This is of great strategic importance to our company,&quot;said Terrence Murray, chairman and chief executive officer ofFleet. &quot;We think we're buying the best single franchises inboth Connecticut and Massachusetts,&quot; where most of Bank ofNew England's assets are located. &quot;It's a terrifichand-in-glove fit for us.&quot;   Fleet will finance the purchase by raising a total of $708million: $283 million in convertible preferred stock thatwill be sold to KKR and its investors; an estimated $175million from the sale of 10 million shares in common stock;$150 million from the sale of subordinated debentures; and$100 million in a publicly sold preferred stock offering.   KKR's $283 million in preferred stock carries no couponand is convertible at $17.65 a share after three years. Inaddition, KKR has warrants to buy 6.5 million Fleet commonshares, also at $17.65 apiece. Together, this would give KKRabout 16.5% of Fleet's stock, although it would all benonvoting stock to satisfy federal banking laws.   Under certain circumstances, KKR investors can convert thepreferred stock into a 50% stake in the Bank of New Englandinstead of Fleet stock.   The FDIC's selection of the winning bidder was announcedafter the close of the stock market. In composite trading onthe New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Fleet/Norstar commonclosed at $17.875, off 37.5 cents.   For KKR, victory in the bidding for Bank of New Englandcomes after two earlier defeats in seeking bank acquisitions.In 1983, KKR considered making a joint bid with theWashington state pension plan for SeaFirst Corp. of Seattle,but was outflanked by BankAmerica, which bought SeaFirst. In1989, KKR was considered a front-runner in the bidding forthe failed Texas banks of MCorp, but lost out to Banc OneCorp. At that time, Comptroller of the Currency Clarkeexpressed concern about whether KKR was a suitable long-terminvestor in the banking industry.   During the past year, KKR has built a 9.9% stake in FirstInterstate Bancorp. through regular stock market purchases,but only as an investment.   The primary factor the FDIC considered in selecting awinning bidder was the cost to the bank insurance fund duringthe period it will take Fleet to assimilate the Bank of NewEngland assets and sell off its bad loans and other credits.The agency said Fleet won because its bid &quot;will have thelowest cost to the bank insurance fund.&quot;   Another attractive element is that it will lead to someconsolidation in a market that is crowded with competitors.Although Fleet has only a minor presence in Massachusetts, ithas banking operations in Connecticut and Maine that will bemerged with overlapping Bank of New England franchises inthose states.   Harrison Young, the FDIC's lead negotiator in thetransaction, said he anticipated large economies from thetakeover, saying that he expected to see &quot;the majority of thecost savings come from combining operations&quot; throughoutFleet's expanded territory.   Harrison Young, the FDIC's lead negotiator in thetransaction, said he anticipated large economies from thetakeover, saying that he expected to see &quot;the majority of thecost savings come from combining operations&quot; throughoutFleet's expanded territory. The acquisition could result insubstantial dismissals of Bank of New England's staff.   Fleet will take over the Bank of New England operationsnext Monday under an interim management agreement. The FDICexpects the acquisition to be completed in about threemonths.   Fleet, while considered among the better managed banks inthe region, hasn't been able to fully escape the effects ofthe New England downturn. It incurred a loss of $48.5 millionin 1990 -- much narrower than other large banks in the region-- largely because of souring real estate loans.   Under Mr. Murray, the bank has expanded aggressively --first into fee-based businesses such as mortgage servicingand student-loan processing, and later by acquisition,including Norstar Bancorp of Albany, N.Y. Ironically, itacquired Norstar after losing out in the bidding for ConiferGroup in Worcester, Mass., to Bank of New England. Analystssay that Bank of New England overpaid for Conifer, whichcontributed to its later problems.   The main challenge for Fleet will be integrating itsoperations with Bank of New England's. &quot;When the integrationis completed, Fleet will have the best franchise from LongIsland, N.Y., all the way up to Maine,&quot; said Gerard Cassidy,an analyst at Tucker, Anthony Inc. &quot;When the region does turnaround, which it will, they will be able to take advantage ofthe turnaround by covering the market like no other bank.&quot;   ---   George Anders in New York contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
