 Beats m.andP;  I didn't even see it all.andP;  Not thatI didn't try.andP;  As one of 110,000 people dashing to visit 1,700 exhibits,numerous conferences, dozens of parties, and uncountable private meetingsbetween the Las Vegas Convention Center and other sites miles apart, missingsomething was unavoidable.andP;  Many people, including myself, adopted mental&quot;blinders,&quot; excluding unending assaults on the senses.andP;  COMDEX is as muchshow-biz as it is technology.andP;  Magician as a metaphor for advanced technologywas a popular and reasonable theme this year.andP;  Several booths had residentillusionists.andP;  It was so easy to miss goodies that every chance encounterwith friends immediately became a snap quiz.andP;  &quot;What did you see?andP;  I've beentrying to find it.andP;  Where is it?andP;  How did I miss it?andP;  I've walked by there 17times!&quot;andM;I went to Fall COMDEX with multiple targets, ranging from VAR information tonew products to competitive perspectives to networking (the people kind), allwith a database management focus.andP;  Much of what happens at COMDEX isinvisible from the convention floor.andP;  There is another conference going onbehind the scenes, in whispered conversations, hotel rooms, privatefunctions, and after-hours gatherings.andP;  By attending &quot;both&quot; conferences Ihoped to give you the full breadth of COMDEX.andP;  As it turned out, this was animpossible mission, but since I was neither caught nor captured, here is whatmy I.M.andP;  Force discovered.andM;First stop, Ashton-TateandM;First stop, Ashton-Tate, where bad news seems to arrive in threes.andP;  Theyreleased a version of dBASE IV with problems ranging from slow speed tobroken networkability to rampant bugs.andP;  Then the dBASE IV SQL implementationis ridiculed for its non-standard syntax and terrible performance.andP;  Now, atCOMDEX, ballpoint pens are given to everyone who enters Ashton-Tate's exhibitroom.andP;  Their third problem, trivial yet ironic, is that the pens, prominentlylabeled &quot;dBASE IV,&quot; generally do not work!andP;  Seriously!andM;Nevertheless, Ashton-Tate was omni-present at COMDEX.andP;  Countless computers inendless booths sported diamond-shaped &quot;dBASE IV On Board&quot; signs (at leastthey weren't yellow).andP;  A few exhibitors even showed their product running,delicately, with dBASE IV.andP;  (A rumored diversion was to walk up to an exhibitrunning dBASE IV and tap a couple of keys to lock it up.andP;  Nothing embarrassesa COMDEX exhibitor more than a cold boot.)andM;Everybody with a dBASE III PLUS related product announced a dBASE IV version.andO;Many firms displayed the &quot;dBASE IV On Board&quot; sign if their product was orwill be dBASE compatible.andP;  Quarterdeck Office Systems flew the dBASE IVbanner because Ashton-Tate announced that Buzzwords International wasdeveloping MoveOver, a tool-set to let multiple dBASE III and IV applicationsuse Desqview to share information.andP;  Microsoft showed dBASE IV running on LanManager, and IBM showed it running on OS/2.andM;While some products were truly targeted at dBASE IV, most new&quot;dBASE-compatible&quot; software actually supports dBASE III PLUS DBFs.andP;  Severalfirms offered graphics functions similar to those profiled last month in DataBased Advisor.andP;  This product category started with a few firms offeringtentative ways to capture video images (from camera or VCR), edit and enhancethem, display them on screen, and send them to laser printers.andP;  A dozen ormore exhibitors showed much more complete combinations of hardware andsoftware to do this and more, including adding images to dBASE applications(and Emerald Bay, too).andP;  What vendors of such products fail to mention isthat high resolution images consume sizable amounts of disk space.andP;  Storing alarge number of pictures of inventory items or real estate listings may betechnically possible but economically prohibitive.andM;Another rapidly improving utility category is form generators with datamerge.andP;  Several products let you draw a form, or scan an existing form, thenprint the form, completely filled in, on a laser printer.andP;  The data can comefrom a variety of sources, to be merged with the form image at print time.andO;Deerfield Systems goes even farther in their Display Form II.andP;  The actualform is displayed on screen.andP;  As the form is completed, information is storedin a dBASE III file.andP;  When a form is printed, data can be merged from dBASEor ASCII files.andM;dBASE IV offers little to fill the common need to cross-tabulate data.andO;Fast-Answer, from the Canadian form, ProMark Software, is a report writerthat directly reads, cross-tabs and formats data from dBASE and 1-2-3 files.andO;Another one of their utilities, Dupe-Out, scans dBASE mailing list files toidentify and eliminate duplicate records.andP;  (As with many products shown atCOMDEX, we can't confirm performance claims until the actual product isevaluated.)andM;SBT demonstrated a multiuser application running simultaneously on a PC and aMacintosh using FoxBASE.andP;  Versions of SBT accounting applications revised forvarious countries were shown, including one that displays text in Chinesecharacters right on the screen.andP;  SBT's Series VII, designed to run with dBASEIV, was demonstrated but not released.andP;  Until dBASE IV stabilizes, SBT musthold their new product at the beta stage.andM;Sourcemate demonstrated two versions of their new AccountMate version 2.0.andO;Version 2.0 adds a wide range of improvements to the dBASE III PLUS version,including the ability to select items by scrolling through a pick list.andP;  ThedBASE IV version, also on hold until Ashton-Tate's product gets fixed, adds anew interface and takes advantage of many new features.andM;Champion and Lake Avenue Software are likewise stuck at the same point.andP;  Bothhave enhanced their dBASE source code accounting systems with spiffy newfeatures that depend on a reliable dBASE IV to perform.andM;Many exhibitors privately expressed concern that the obvious problems ofdBASE IV &quot;The Product&quot; will mar the image of dBASE &quot;The Category.&quot;andP;  Onetheory was that six months would give Ashton-Tate enough time to finish betatesting.andP;  Will COMDEX/Spring, in Chicago, be the place where dBASE IVapplications can actually be delivered?andM;COMDEX offered further evidence that, for programmers who are willing tomaster several dialectical variations, speaking dBASE will become even morevaluable.andP;  As expected, all existing dBASE compatible language products arebeing enhanced.andP;  Perhaps unexpected by those who believe that dBASE IV is aclone-killer, several new dBASE language compatible products are on theirway.andM;XDB Systems, developers of the SQL relational database system XDB, plans toadd a dBASE language compiler front-end by spring.andP;  Borland's dBASEcompatible product wasn't announced but was much whispered about.andP;  In view ofBorland's recent cut-backs, introducing a new product into an already-crowdedmarket may not be wise unless it offers a significant new twist.andP;  Thewhispers weren't about whether Borland has dBASE clone, but about what mightmake it desirable.andP;  A dBASE language front-end to Paradox might be popular,as would a dBASE implementation that provided the same SQL serverconnectivity as Paradox will soon have.andP;  Even a new version of a venerableshareware product, PC-File, now uses DBF files, and promises to add a dBASElanguage soon.andP;  The new product is dubbed PC-File:dB.andM;WordTech Systems, who had previously established a position as a dBASEconnection to Oracle, announced similar arrangements for Gupta Technologies'SQLBase and Novell's XQL.andP;  Word Tech's plan, apparently, is to position dBXLand Quicksilver as dBASE language front-ends to the SQL servers of variousmajor firms.andM;The Fox StoryandM;FoxBASE+ has perhaps the shortest distance to go to meet the dBASE IVchallenge.andP;  At a breakfast with Fox Software, dBASE IV was described asrunning much slower than promised.andP;  While it does perform certaincomputational functions faster than dBASE III PLUS, Fox claims dBASE Ivactually runs slower than dBASE III PLUS in many data manipulations.andP;  OverallFox ranks dBASE IV about two times faster than dBASE III PLUS, withFoxBASE+2.10 ranked 3.7 times faster.andM;President Dave Fulton outlined key elements in Fox Software's strategy forthe next year.andP;  Their priorities: DOS,  Macintosh, then Presentation Manager.andO;Claiming that &quot;products that only support one platform will have tough timesin coming years,&quot; Dr. Fulton sees multiuser FoxBASE+/Mac as a majorachievement.andP;  Users can now share DBF files with complete record and filelocking between DOS and Mac machines.andP;  Connected across a network likeNovell, 3Com, or Appleshare (but not TOPS, which uses too much PC RAM, lacksNETBIOS, and doesn't support extended Mac file features), users can adoptwhatever workstation they prefer, PC or Mac, and run the same multiuserFoxBASE+ application.andP;  FoxBASE+/Mac will also be enhanced in the firstquarter with a new report writer and hypercard XCMD linking.andP;  FoxBASE+/Macwill eventually have full dBASE IV and SQL compatibility.andP;  Fox has aMacintosh head-start, but they won't be alone.andP;  Ashton-Tate will be rewritingdBASE/Mac to do the same thing with dBASE IV about a year from now.andP;  EmeraldBay is also adding Macintosh support as soon as possible.andM;Around February, Fox's dBASE IV language compatible release should appear,with much faster speed (two times faster than dBASE IV and six to seven timesfaster than FoxBASE+ 2.10), and additional features.andP;  Actually, the newFoxBASE+ will only be a partial clone of dBASE IV, compatible just at thelanguage and data file levels.andP;  Not compatible will be the template language,command center interface, documenter utilities, and report writer.andP;  Fox's SQLversion will not be a dBASE IV clone, mainly because Fox doesn't want toemulate what they see as major flaws in Ashton-Tate's approach to SQL.andO;FoxBASE+ will use fully-integrated embedded SQL commands, and will supportdual FoxBASE+/dBASE IV syntax where feasible.andP;  A new SET COMPATIBLE ON/OFFcommand will be available to resolve direct conflicts (where the same commandmeans something different to dBASE than to Fox-BASE+).andP;  While Fox is writingtheir own local workstation SQL, they'd prefer to license a sturdy centralserver (perhaps Emerald Bay's?), then integrate it with FoxBASE+.andP;  The SQLserver version of Fox will have a data dictionary, a vital facility manyhoped to see in dBASE IV.andM;FoxBASE+ will become more Clip-per-like by greatly expanding UDFfunctionality, and adding the ability to manipulate memo fields as strings ofup to 32K in length.andP;  By mid-year FoxBASE+ will be able to generate EXEfiles.andP;  Dr. Fulton sees this as a &quot;packaging issue,&quot; since internallyFoxBASE+ EXEs will still contain a runtime library, as Clipper EXEs do today.andO;No promise was made to dump Fox's separate runtime nonsense.andP;  Coming soon toFoxBASE+ are mouse support, LIM 4.0 support, and the ability to use as muchscreen resolution as possible.andP;  FoxBASE+ will be able to present graphicalscreens similar to those used in FoxBASE+/Mac.andP;  The DOS and OS/2 versionswill use character graphics, the Presentation Manager version will use truebit-mapped graphics.andP;  Still obsessed by speed, all of Fox's future productsinclude a specification of &quot;several times faster than dBASE IV.&quot;andM;Of course, these promises were made a few days before Ashton-Tate filed theirlawsuit againt Fox Software, a suit that might delay or even divert Fox'sprogress.andP;  It also might kill dBASE.andP;  Examples abound of the futility oftrying to win anyplace but on the playing field.andP;  In order to save the MicroChannel Architecture, IBM is frantically trying to get other firms to makeclones.andP;  A single source product is too risky for Corporate America, and IBMhas discovered that one firm doesn't make a market.andP;  Yet Ashton-Tate istrying to get to exactly where IBM is trying to leave.andP;  Without the dynamicsof competition, few products evolve as rapidly as users require.andP;  Killing offthe competition won't necessarily leave dBASE IV as the survivor.andP;  I'mrooting for all the new dBASE-compatible products, but I'm also spending alot more time with Emerald Bay/Eagle.andM;Where's Emerald Bay?andM;Eagle is almost ready to soar over Emerald Bay.andP;  This &quot;next generation&quot; ofdBASe shows great progress and exciting potential.andP;  The central serverdatabase engine eliminates the short-comings that are so obvious in othermultiuser dBASE products.andP;  NETBIOS or Novell's IPX is all that's needed tocommunicate with Emerald Bay's server, meaning that a multiuser Eagleapplication can operate without using a network operating system at all, justcommon network interface cards.andP;  Most firms would still want a networkoperating system like Novell, PC Net or Lantastic to support otherapplications and spool printers, but it's exciting to know that Emerald Baywill be so full-featured.andM;In a private meeting, Wayne Ratliff, Jordan Brown and Bob Byers describedtheir coming Macintosh surface, SQL surface, and support by other productswhose applications will be able to talk to Emerald Bay.andP;  On a networkinstalled in Migent's suite, an Eagle application and a Lotus 1-2-3spreadsheet were both connected to an Emerald Bay databased.andP;  When data waschanged in the Eagle program, pressing F9 (1-2-3's &quot;Recale&quot;) caused thespreadsheet to be instantly updated with the new information.andP;  The Eagleprogram even included a video image, stored in a binary field, displayed viaa menu choice.andP;  Very impressive.andP;  The more I see of the various attempts totie database managers to a central server the more I appreciate WayneRatliff's approach: clean, powerful, and efficient.andP;  dBASE developers owethemselves a test flight with Eagle.andM;The Paradox linkandM;In Philippe Kahn's aptly-named &quot;Fantasy Suite&quot; in Caesar's Palace (with agrand piano in a two-story hotel room), Borland's Richard Schwartz and KenEinstein showed Data Based Advisor Paradox's new ability to transparentlylink with a variety of SQL-based servers.andP;  Our demonstration had Paradoxsharing a network with IBM's Presentation Manager database manager on asecond computer and Oracle's SQL server on a third.andP;  When a Paradox query wasentered, Paradox figured out which server held the data, Made the connectionacross the network, issued a SQL command using the syntax appropriate for thespecific SQL server, passed results back over the network to Paradox,converted it into a Paradox table, and presented it for our perusal.andP;  To theuser it was just another Paradox query by example, nothing out of theordinary.andP;  Borland has been positioning Paradox as a PC-based tool forcorporate environments.andP;  This SQL connection will make Paradox an ideal userinterface to mini and mainframe databases.andM;Talking headsandM;Conferences are a valuable part of COMDEX.andP;  Adam Green hosted a paneldiscussion on &quot;SAA and SQL: Initial Impressions for Database VARs.&quot;andP;  Everyoneon the panel agreed that few people know much about IBM's Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA).andP;  It is not seen as offering anything particularlysuperior, but users do show a preference for standardization.andP;  Fox Software'sDave Fulton said the new FoxBASE+ interface will use SAA keystrokeassignments because he sees no reason to inven t others.andP;  But he believespublishers with established products will find it very difficult to justifyswitching to an SAS-style interface.andP;  An audience, member commented thatpossibly the corporate marketplace will force adoption by purchasing onlySAA-style products.andM;Considering the heat being generated by a horde of vendors, shedding light onthe SQL issue is timely.andP;  Asked, &quot;is SQL really a standard?&quot; most panelistsagreed that the ANSI SQL standard is only a subset of the functions needed inreal applications.andP;  Oracle's Gene Shklar believes SQL is a true standard withminor dialectical differences between vendors.andP;  XDB Systems' Bing Yaocautions that because SQL extensions vary, true portability is threatened.andO;David Kaplan of Microsoft wasn't sure how much actual demand for portabilityacross platforms exists.andP;  He agrees with the general feeling that SQL must beembedded in a database language to be useful for applications development.andO;Joe Alsop of Progress Software did an audience survey to confirm the viewthat SQL's main value was as a non-procedural data query tool within anotherlanguage.andP;  Dave Fulton joked that he once considered putting &quot;Now with SQL&quot;on FoxBASE+ boxes, since he presumed no one would use it anyway.andP;  Admittingthat he's joined the believers, Fulton sees Fox's mission as making SQLusable by dBASE developers.andP;  To make such integration as seamless aspossible, Fox will not adhere to Ashton-Tate's dBASE IV/SQL methods.andP;  Thisbrought disagreement from John Henderson of Concentric Data System, whobelieves users really want portability, including the ability to move betweendBASE and FoxBASE.andP;  Adam Green concluded by saying that, while Ashton-Tatedid adopt much of the SAA user interface standard in dBASE IV, they'veimplemented SQL in a non-standard way that others may not want to copy.andM;The party animalandM;For many convention-goers, COMDEX wouldn't be COMDEX without parties.andP;  Withseveral to choose from each night, I caroused with the database crowd.andO;Ashton-Tate rocked in a high-tech disco, dark, smokey and ear-shatteringlyloud.andP;  WordTech hosted a sedate gathering in a garden setting, serenaded by asmooth pianist playing Gershwin.andP;  And this magazine threw a huge bash in agiant tent, complete with lively mariachi music, endless eats, and festiveelbow-rubbing with everybody you've ever heard of in the database world.andM;The party's overandM;So, what does COMDEX mean?andP;  Everything, and nothing.andP;  If you can absorb itall, you'll come away with a feeling for the PC industry you can't getanyplace else.andP;  It's efficient in getting almost everything that counts inone place (or at least, in one town).andP;  It's also expensive, both in the costof going, and the cost of losing a week of work (and possibly at the gamingtables).andM;Sprawling COMDEX suffers from poorly-focused obesity.andP;  With hotels andexhibit sites all over town, something must be done to improve&quot;connectivity.&quot;andP;  Shuttle buses were inadequate, taxis were often scarce, andthe lack of hotel rooms put some conventioneers 30 miles away in BoulderCity.andP;  COMDEX booths are not grouped by any category, so it's impossible toefficiently gather information on specific topics.andP;  Besides, the productsannounced at COMDEX will receive plenty of publicity elsewhere.andP;  Sinceattendees were a mix of dealers, VARs, consultants, vendors, press, corporatebuyers, and end users, conducting serious business in the booths isinhibited.andP;  Product demonstrators have a tough time because they don't knowwho's in the audience.andP;  In general, COMDEX is pretty much of a mess.andP;  Butit's what we've got and we need it, or something like it.andP;  I'd embrace anannual database convention (not sponsored by any particular vendor),reasonably priced and widely attended.andP;  Until my wish comes true, if you needto find anybody who's anybody in microcomputing in one spot, COMDEX is it.andO;See you next year!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
