British Airways suspended service of its two A320 jets atmidnight Sunday while waiting for information about the cause ofthe crash near the Swiss-French border which killed three people.   Following discussions with Airbus Industrie, the plane'smanufacturer, and Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, BritishAirways said it will on Tuesday resume its A320 service betweenLondon's Gatwick Airport and various European destinations.   ``We are satisfied with the safety and operating integrity ofthe aircraft,'' said an airline spokesman, speaking anonymously inkeeping with British custom.   Michael Hennell, a professor of computational mathematics atLiverpool University, said he has been warning authorities sincelast year about flaws in the A320, the first civilian airliner witha fully computerized flight-control system that performs many taskspreviously done by pilots.   The system replaces the pilot's control stick with a series ofcomputers and miles of electronic cables. Instead of the pilotphysically moving the stick to adjust the aircraft's flaps, forexample, computers are used to send an electronic signal to theflaps.   Airbus Industrie maintains the system permits safer,electronically controlled flight, but Hennell said it does notalways allow the pilot to override the computer. Airbus is afour-nation consortium in which Britain has a large stake.   ``The pilot has very little last say,'' Hennell said. ``It isthe computer that really determines what is to happen and that isto avoid pilot error.   ``Computers control almost every aspect of this aircraft. It isvery hard to see what could have happened that couldn't be laid atthe door of one of the computers.''   Hennell has campaigned before Britain's Civil Aviation Authorityagainst licensing the A320.   Hennell said in a British Broadcasting Corp. TV interview: ``Thebasic problem as I see it is that we don't have the technology toensure that the computer programs are anything like correct. Thetechnology of writing programs and designing computers of thiscomplexity just is not adequate for this sort of task.''   But Capt. Paul Wilson, of the Guild of Air Pilots, told the BBC:``I don't believe the computer system is responsible for thisaccident.''</TEXT></DOC>
