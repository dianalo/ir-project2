We now have 90. We also have 40 women and children in ourconvent,'' said the Rev. Gregory Boyle, pastor of Mission Dolores, aRoman Catholic parish that has become a refuge to illegal immigrantsfrom Mexico and Central America.   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents on Wednesdayarrested 27 more suspected illegal aliens aboard a Piedmont Airlinesflight during a stop in Charlotte, N.C., between Phoenix and NewYork.   The journey of the Salvadorans, Ecuadorans, Mexicans andBrazilians began with an America West flight from Los Angeles toPhoenix, authorities said.   On Monday, 79 suspected illegal aliens taking Eastern Airlines'``red eye'' from Los Angeles to New York were arrested during a stopin Atlanta. Late Monday, 69 were arrested while boarding the sameflight in Los Angeles.   The 1986 Immigration Control and Reform Act hits employers withsanctions if they hire illegal aliens. On Wednesday, a Californiafarm labor contractor accused of more than 330 violations of the lawbecame the first agricultural business in the nation to be finedunder the law.   Sandamp;A Farm Contractors of Madera was fined $153,250 for employing27 illegal aliens who were arrested during Border Patrol sweeps inJanuary, said J. William Carter, chief of the Border Patrol officein Livermore.   Some officials say the law may be the reason why illegalimmigrants are turning away from their longtime destination, LosAngeles and California farms.   Neil Jacobs, the assistant INS director for investigations inAtlanta, described Los Angeles as ``literally saturated withaliens,'' and said word has gotten around that they can't get jobs.   Boyle agreed, and said it stems from the immigration law reform.   ``My feeling is there is a saturation here,'' he said, notingthat movement into the agricultural San Joaquin Valley evaporatedmonths ago.   Smugglers' use of airlines is not new, although it is notconsidered commonplace. The Charlotte arrests were the third forthat Piedmont flight since October.   ``Apparently, they've been using the flight for the last threemonths pretty regularly,'' said David Carmichael, INS supervisor inCharlotte.   In the case of Eastern's ``red eye,'' Flight 80, the INS believesseveral smugglers were taking advantage of low fares to move thealiens, who are subject to deportation if caught.   ``This flight, we are hopeful, will be closed to smugglers ofaliens, but we expect there will be other flights in the future,''said Donald H. Looney, acting district director of the INS in LosAngeles.   Airlines say they cooperate with the INS but do not have policiesof trying to determine if any passengers might be illegal immigrants.   ``We don't engage in trying to detect these types ofpassengers,'' said Eastern spokeswoman Virginia Sanchez in Miami.``That's what the INS is there for. If they wish to enforce theirimmigration regulations, that's part of their job.''   America West reserves the right to ask any passenger foridentification, but that would not be operationally possibleconsidering the airline carried 13 million passengers last year,said spokesman Dick Shimizu.   ``I'm sure you would be able to see the enormous delays.''   Delta, a major airline serving Los Angeles, also doesn't checkidentification, said spokeswoman Glenda Hatchett Johnson in Atlanta.   Boyle, the parish pastor, is not convinced that large numbers areleaving Los Angeles, especially by the smuggling schemes that theINS said cost aliens up to $4,000. ``The concept of $4,000 _ I can'teven wrap my mind about that one,'' he said.   He is certain, however, that illegal immigrants will continue tocome.   ``As hopeless as things are becoming here, it's even more so fromwhere they come,'' Boyle said.   ``Nightly, now, there's not a single square foot of place leftwhere a person could lie down.''</TEXT></DOC>
