The agreement, signed yesterday, calls for the company'sATandamp;T Network Systems International overseas arm to own 68% ofthe venture, called ATandamp;T St. Petersburg. The rest will beheld by Dalnya Sviaz, the Russian supplier, ATandamp;T said.</LP><TEXT>   In its initial phase, ATandamp;T St. Petersburg will be suppliedby ATandamp;T Network Systems' factory in Huizen, the Netherlands,near the overseas arm's European headquarters. ATandamp;T and itsRussian partner will then adapt the equipment to localstandards to work with Russia's antiquated phone system,which stretches over 11 time zones. &quot;The business potential,given the country's size, is enormous,&quot; said a spokesman.   Financial details of the agreement were sketchy. ATandamp;T'sspokesman described the initial investment as &quot;relativelysmall, a few million dollars.&quot; The first office will have 15people. The partners are still trying to work out how ATandamp;Tcan repatriate its profit from Russia, whose ruble currencyisn't yet convertible. &quot;We're considering all kinds offinancing methods, including barter,&quot; the spokesman said.   ATandamp;T said the partners will sell highspeed transmissionequipment. Later, they may do joint manufacturing, thespokesman said.   ATandamp;T has big plans for the former Soviet republics. Itrecently signed a pact to build and operate a long-distancephone network in Ukraine, as well as to supply equipment andexplore a joint manufacturing arrangement. It also openeddirect communications between Armenia and the U.S.   But ATandamp;T isn't the first telephone company attracted bybusiness opportunities resulting from the fall of communismin Eastern Europe and the former U.S.S.R. France's Alcatelalready operates joint manufacturing operations in Russia.Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd. yesterday disclosed anagreement to equip Czechoslovakia with data packet switchingequipment for a new public data network.   None of these deals, however, call for state-of-the artequipment such as ATandamp;T's sophisticated 5ESS digital phoneswitch. The U.S.'s largest phone manufacturer used thesigning of the accord in St. Petersburg to renew its call forthe Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls,which is controlled by the U.S. and its allies, to put theCold War behind it and lift restrictions on shipments ofhigh-technology gear bound for the republics.   ATandamp;T's efforts in the former Soviet Union &quot;should put ATandamp;Tahead of its competitors in the race to sell phone equipmentin the republics,&quot; said H. Paris Burstyn, telecommunicationsanalyst at Business Research Group, a division of CahnersPublishing Co., Newton, Mass. &quot;Telephone penetration in thecountry is very low, and the technology in use is out of the1920s.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
