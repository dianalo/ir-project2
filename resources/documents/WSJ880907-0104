Dorfman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> OAT MO PRGR GE </CO><IN> STK </IN><TEXT>   What's cooking at Quaker Oats Co.?    R. Bruce Sampsell, president of the Fisher-Price division, sold 40,740 shares last month at $51.50 a share, realizing more than $2 million on the sale. The sale amounted to 93% of his holdings.    In early August, Quaker asked the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange to investigate the source of takeover rumors that were roiling its stock. One rumor said that Philip Morris Cos. might bid for Quaker. Around the same time, Quaker reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Daily trading volume at the food company surged to nine times normal on Aug. 5.    On Aug. 9, Mr. Sampsell sold the 40,740 shares, which he had acquired by exercising stock options in January. The same day, James R. Tindall, a corporate vice president, sold 4,500 shares.    Messrs. Sampsell and Tindall couldn't be reached for comment, and may simply have been taking advantage of the favorable price.    But even before the August price runup, eight insiders had sold at least 1,000 shares apiece. Those sales mainly took place in the spring, at prices near $45.    No Quaker Oats officers or directors have purchased shares lately, according to insider filings, though some have accumulated shares through company plans or by exercising stock options. A spokesman for Quaker said that in many cases officers who sell company stock are &quot;simply trying to diversify their holdings.&quot;    ---   Launched last week, the Insider Trading Spotlight is based on data provided by Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., database service that collects insider reports filed with the SEC. Using criteria devised by The Wall Street Journal, Invest/Net screens all the data to produce the table to be published each Wednesday.    Insider buying generally suggests that officers and directors like their company's prospects. But selling doesn't necessarily indicate pessimism; it may mean that someone is paying a tuition bill, diversifying his or her holdings, or buying a house.    The ranking of individuals' transactions by dollar value is based solely on the previous week's filings. The company rankings include only companies whose officers and directors filed at least one report during the week, but the rankings are based on transactions over the past eight weeks.    In the company portion, the percentage shown for the eight-week and 24-week periods measures the change in the holdings of only those insiders who traded during those periods. It doesn't measure the change in holdings of all insiders as a class. The idea is to measure the thinking of people who may have recently re-evaluated their companies' prospects in deciding whether to buy or sell its shares.    The table reflects shares insiders hold directly, and also shares they control or influence indirectly (through trusts, for example). Where some or all of the shares in a transaction are held indirectly, a footnote will so indicate.    (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ Sept. 7, 1988)   ---   BRIEFLY NOTED: Golfing great Arnold Palmer picked up another 1,784 shares of Progroup Inc. last month for about $15,000. He already had more than 241,000 shares, and now owns close to 10% of the Chattanooga, Tenn., sporting goods company.    Over the past 24 weeks, six insiders have bought General Electric Co. stock and none have sold. The latest to buy was Lawrence E. Fouraker, a director and former dean of the Harvard Business School. He bought 1,000 shares, doubling his holding. </TEXT></DOC>
