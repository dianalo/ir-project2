I'd hate tothink it is politically motivated material. You get sick and tiredof saying `I've told the truth' ... You get bombarded by theseinsinuations and tired stories.''   The magazine reported Sunday that arms dealer Richard J.Brenneke had said in a sworn deposition to a Senate ForeignRelations subcommittee that Donald Gregg was the Washington contactfor the enterprise, called Arms Supermarket.   Bush campaign spokesman Pete Teeley said Sunday he believed theallegation had been raised before, and that Gregg had said he hadnot spoken with Brenneke. ``Gregg has denied that,'' Teeley said.   Bush said today of Teeley's response, ``I think Pete Teeley putit in great perspective yesterday. It's just pure unadulterated _I've got to watch my language.''   Bush also implied that Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of thesubcommittee that Brenneke testified before, leaked the informationto Newsweek.   ``If Sen. Kerry and that committee of his have any allegationsto make against anybody who works for me or against me, I wouldthink they would have the courtesy instead of going with thesenameless stories to stand up and say what they are,'' he said.   Bush's office told the magazine that Brenneke's story was ``justrumors and the same old regurgitated stories we thought we'd put torest long ago.''   Newsweek quoted unidentifed Senate staffers as saying they hadconfirmed part of Brenneke's story from an agent with Israel'sMossad secret service and from former Panamanian consul JoseBlandon but are still assessing Brenneke's credibility.   Arms Supermarket supplied the Nicaraguan rebels during thecongressional aid cutbacks of 1984-86, before the Iran-Contraoperation set up by National Security Council aide Lt. Col. OliverNorth, the magazine said.   It involved CIA arms merchants, Mossad agents, the intelligencearm of the Honduran military and members of a Colombian drugcartel, according to Newsweek.   Brenneke, an Oregon businessman with connections in the Sovietbloc, has done work for both Mossad and the CIA, the magazine said.   Newsweek, quoting unidentified government sources, publicrecords about the Iran-Contra affair and the subcommittee'sinvestigation, reported that Brenneke also said the Medellincocaine cartel put up financing for the operation, used its planesto fly arms to the Contras and then used the same planes to flysome of its drug shipments from Colombia to the United States.   Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega granted transitprivileges for the flights and took a cut of the profits, Blandontestified at the committee hearings, according to Newsweek.   The magazine did not say how much in arms reached the Contras.It said the Arms Supermarket had been phased out by August 1986,with $20 million of arms left unsold in warehouses in Honduras.   According to Newsweek, in a July 12, 1985 notebook entry _recently released by the Iran-contra joint committee _ Northpredicted a ``bad end'' for the Arms Supermarket. ``$14 M(illion)to finance came from drugs,'' he wrote, the magazine said.</TEXT></DOC>
