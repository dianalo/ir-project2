The system has taken 4,096 x 4,096 x 12-bit images with ameasured spatial resolution of 8 line pairs per millimeter. Until a largerdisplay system is available, image display will take place on two 1,024x 1,280-pixel display systems with access to the full database. The imagingsystem is described in detail, comparison images of phantoms is shown,limited human testing is described, and potential for exploitation ofthe digital nature of the image for improving diagnostic accuracy isdiscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
