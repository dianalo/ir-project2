Specific claims could not be confirmed by independent sources.But Western sources at the Thai-Cambodian border confirmed that oneguerrilla faction, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front,made major gains against Cambodian government forces.   ``We will know more in the next couple of days; at the moment itis difficult to judge how much is true and how much ispropaganda,'' a Western relief official based in Aranyaprathet saidon condition of anonymity.   The claims came less than a week after Vietnam said its lasttroops had left Cambodia, where they fought the guerrillas for morethan a decade.   Abdulgaffar Peang-Meth, spokesman for the Liberation Front, said5,000 fighters launched attacks against five towns and otherpositions along Highway 69, which runs parallel to theThai-Cambodian border in northwestern Cambodia.   A second guerrilla faction, loyal to resistance leader PrinceNorodom Sihanouk, said it had joined the Liberation Front in a``general offensive'' and had taken part in some of the fighting onSaturday.   A Sihanouk spokesman, Bounthy Ung, said the Khmer Rouge _ theCommunist faction in the three-faction coalition _ had not joinedin the fighting.   The groups are fighting the Cambodian government in a loosecoalition led by Sihanouk.   The Western relief official said heavy shelling could be heardduring the day near Aranyaprathet, a key border town.   The acting Liberation Front commander-in-chief, Gen. Dien Del,said the insurgents damaged a number of tanks, overran 10 PhnomPenh army positions flanking Highway 69 and seized the districtcapital of Thmar Puok, which the Vietnamese army had left just sixdays ago as part of its withdrawal from Cambodia.   Bounthy Ung also said the fighters had taken Phom Srok, adistrict seat about 40 miles inside Cambodia from the Thai border.Dien Del said the insurgents also seized Banteay Chmar and found awarehouse containing 1,000 weapons and other military hardware.   The general said his forces were closing in on two other towns,Svey Chiek and Kandoun, and had surrounded Sisophon, at thestrategic crossroad of Highway 69 and national Route 5, which leadsto Phnom Penh.   Dien Del said the guerrillas intended to test the strength ofthe Cambodian government and ``force Phnom Penh to the negotiatingtable. Today is a very big day for the KPNLF. It is the largestvictory in 10 years.''   He said the attackers suffered few casualties.   A Western diplomat who requested anonymity questioned whetherthe guerrillas would be able to hold onto their gains.   The Liberation Front, reportedly using conventional war tacticsrather than guerrilla-style ones in the attacks, is armed withlight-infantry weapons and newly acquired 84mm anti-tank rockets.   The Soviet-supplied Cambodian army has tanks and heavy artillery.   ``We have less war material than (the government),'' Dien Delsaid, ``but we have more experience, better morale and bettertraining. We have been fighting for 10 years.''   The Liberation Front claims to have more than 16,000 fighters.The strongest guerrilla group, the Khmer Rouge, fields between30,000 and 40,000, according to Western estimates.   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge inlate 1978, said it completed the withdrawal of all its troops fromthe country on Tuesday. But the guerrillas say thousands ofVietnamese have stayed behind.   The Khmer Rouge recently claimed a series of battle successesagainst Cambodian army units. Officials in Phnom Penh have admittedsome setbacks near the town of Pailin in western Cambodia butinsist their forces can keep control of the area.   When it was in power between 1975 and 1978, the Khmer Rougekilled hundreds of thousands of people in an attempt to impose aradical agarian society.</TEXT></DOC>
