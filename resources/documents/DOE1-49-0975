As compared with RADSHIP-2 codewhich we presented in the Waste Management '86 Symposium, the major improvementin RADSHIP-3 involves the following additional considerations: the exposurepathway to the pedestrians, the shielding effect of housing, the useof the experimental data of doses to replace the original calculationmodel for handlers and crewmen, and the extension of the functional modefor analyzing the radiological impact from spent fuel transportation.Besides, RADSHIP-3 code also involves a new dispersion model in sea,modifies the resuspension dose factor, and adds nuclides for the analysisof radioactive material transportation. Based on the Taipower's radwastetransportation data and with the aid of FACOM-M200 computer system, theresults calculated from both RADSHIP-3 and RADSHIP-2 are compared. Thecomparison reveals that the annual doses computed from RADSHIP-3 aremuch more reasonable and acceptable than those from RADSHIP-2, particularlyunder the operational and environmental conditions in Taiwan.</TEXT></DOC>
