Hechema, he suggested that a taqueria might be a good idea.;  But Hechema, an immigrant from Egypt by way of San Jose, decided thatHollister already had enough taquerias, and he wanted to do somethingdifferent.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HOLLISTER RESTAURATEUR BETS ON FALAFEL TO WINCUSTOMERS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     B.J.'s Gourmet Cuisine is different, serving a mix of Middle Eastern,American and Mexican dishes all prepared by Hechema daily using fresh, localproduce and fresh meat from Santa Clara.;   &quot;I was scared at first because itisn't traditional,&quot; said Hechema, 35. But the Middle Eastern shish kebabs andfalafel -- a spicy, deep-fried patty of ground chickpeas and herbs -- are someof his best-selling items, he said.;   This is the first restaurant forHechema, who said he learned to cook from his mother when he was 7 years old.At 8, he was preparing food for the troop on his Egyptian Boy Scout outings.Before opening shop in Hollister, he ran a catering service in San Jose.;  The building on San Benito Street where B.J.'s is located was originally aWendy's and later was occupied by two different taquerias -- all of which wentout of business. The location was considered a problem because of its distancefrom downtown and because access can be difficult.;   The owner of the leasewas frustrated with the turnover and handed Hechema the keys with theinstructions to &quot;go do something with the place,&quot; Hechema said, adding that hethinks the location is fine -- on the main street in a large, clean buildingwith adequate parking. He said he is convinced he can remove the &quot;jinx&quot; on thebuilding.;   Since opening in March, the restaurant has been breaking even, hesaid. To help keep prices low, Hechema employs only a small staff, withhimself and his Egyptian-born wife, Mona, plus three additional employees.Hechema, dressed in jeans, sneakers and a red polo shirt, sometimes waitstables and likes to talk with customers.;   Although business has been slow,B.J.'s is steadily building up a clientele of regulars who are spreadingaround town, Hechema said.;   &quot;It only takes 10 good customers here to get 100to come because everybody knows each other,&quot; he said.;   Hechema recentlybegan serving an all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet with traditional foods suchas homemade biscuits and country gravy, pancakes, sausage and eggs, as well assome ethnic dishes such as chorizo, linguica, tortillas and beans. The set-upis geared toward commuters, who can come in at 6 a.m., serve themselves and beout the door in 20 minutes, Hechema said.;   Opening early for breakfast meansHechema must put in 18-hour days, arriving by 4 a.m. with an hour's commutefrom San Jose. But he said he expects the hard work to pay off.;   Hechema'sCatholic parents migrated from Lebanon to Egypt in 1948 when fighting brokeout over the formation of Israel. Hechema married in 1979 and left Egypt in1980. At the time, he said he told his wife, &quot; 'If we stay in Egypt we willnever be anything, never do anything.';   &quot;We knew that if we came to theUnited States, we would have to work hard. But hard-working people can achievetheir goals here.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAT PAQUETTE, Special to the Mercury News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910909  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  547  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, September 9, 199100253067,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
