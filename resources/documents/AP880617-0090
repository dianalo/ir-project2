President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq put the law, known as Shariah,into effect Wednesday night in a televised address to the nation.   The decree makes Islam ``the supreme law of Pakistan'' but willnot affect the rights of non-Moslems or the country's businesscontracts with other nations, Zia said.   Ms. Bhutto, leader of the Pakistan People's Party, said Zia had``no right to impose his will on the people of Pakistan,''according to a report today in the English-language Daily Muslim.   ``Islam, like in the past, is again being used to perpetuateoppressive rule,'' she was quoted as telling journalists Wednesday.   ``We believe it is not the business of a caretaker government oran individual to impose their views on the nation,'' Ms. Bhuttosaid. ``Like in the past, we will resist any such move.''   Zia, who also is chief of the army, fired his entire civiliangovernment May 29 and dissolved the national assembly.   He claimed that in three years in power, they failed to enactthe Islamic code and to battle deteriorating law and order.   Zia hinted that elections would be announced within 90 days buthas yet to set a date.   Zia ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar AliBhutto, in a 1977 military coup and had him hanged two years laterfor complicity in a murder plot.   After ruling eight years under martial law, Zia allowed acivilian government to form in 1985.   Ms. Bhutto, 35, repeated her call for free elections and deniedreports that her advancing pregnancy would prevent her frompreaching the party's platform of popular socialism.   She was married to Karachi businessman Asif Zardari lastDecember and is expecting her first child in December.</TEXT></DOC>
