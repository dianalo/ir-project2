On Monday the Senate produced by that election took its first major action. Fifty-seven senators signed a letter urging President Reagan to abide by the terms of the SALT II nuclear-arms treaty, which was negotiated from 1972 to 1979, criticized relentlessly by the Senate from 1977 to 1979, withdrawn from the ratification process by President Carter in 1980, and expired altogether in 1985. With 57 senators throwing themselves foursquare behind a stone-dead treaty, the record of the new Senate has nowhere to go but up.    Some people no doubt will regard the senators' letter as merely a well-intended attempt at arms control. Mr. Reagan recently armed a B-52 bomber with nuclear-armed cruise missiles, breaching the limits set in President Carter's 1979 treaty with Leonid Brezhnev. The supporters of that unratified treaty are upset. Their distress, however, shouldn't prevent the rest of us from more closely examining the political significance of the senators' letter.    Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution says the ratification of treaties is the Senate's job: The president &quot;shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present concur.&quot; The 57 senatorial letter signers, however, quite obviously want Ronald Reagan to do their work for them. They want him to &quot;ratify&quot; SALT II, a treaty he neither negotiated nor signed.    There has been a lot of talk recently about U.S. foreign policy and about how Congress has to reassert itself in the policy-making process. Is this treaty-ratification-by-letter what the Beltway has in mind?    The letter writers' extraordinary abdication of constitutional responsibility is unsettling enough. Equally disturbing is the almost easeful manner with which these 57 senators would adopt such a strategy. In its first test, SALT II was exposed to two years of thorough, demanding debate. Times have changed. Under the new rules of Washington's debased political games, you put an issue in play with some grandiose but ultimately empty public-relations gesture, such as this letter. The senators' institutional prestige guarantees that the gesture will receive overnight play in the news. After that, the ball sits in the president's court, with the burden on him to react to the &quot;position&quot; taken by a &quot;majority of the Senate.&quot; And that's it. No-sweat politics.    Sen. Bob Dole, apparently deciding that this game needs new rules, has decided to blow the whistle on it. Sen. Dole says he may try to force a Senate vote next year on the actual language of the 1979 SALT II treaty. This means we may all have the opportunity to reargue the merits of SALT II, and we suspect the wings are crammed with people who will be only too happy to accommodate the 57 letter-legislators.    One signer whose views should be especially interesting if that debate occurs is Sen. John Glenn, who in 1977 took the lead in reducing SALT to rubble. Back then, Sen. Glenn said: &quot;We are unable to distinguish now between the SS-20 and the SS-16 mobiles. They can convert without detection. We cannot really pinpoint which boosters are MIRVed and not MIRVed. We cannot tell whether the Backfire is going to be refueled or not because refueling probes can be internal. . . . We have no way of checking their reload capabilities on individual silos. . . . These are examples that I can think of this morning, just off the top of my head, without really going through the documents.&quot;    Today Sen. Glenn is just a signer. This effort's intellectual force is Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, whose letter says the Soviets &quot;have respected&quot; the treaty's numerical limits. We would look forward to hearing Sen. Bumpers and his 56 colleagues defend the Soviet compliance record on the floor of the Senate.    In fact, the chances of such an informed debate taking place are about zero. The letter writers won't stand for that fight. The fact that a majority of the senators equate their signatures with arms control suggests the larger crisis of political responsibility in Washington. The members of Congress have become adept at denouncing executive-branch actions and demanding that presidents comply with obsolete arms-control treaties. But when it comes time to bear public responsibility for the consequences of those actions, Congress disappears. </TEXT></DOC>
