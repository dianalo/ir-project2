After the lastsliver of space in the old dump is filled, San Lorenzo Valley's trash will betrucked from the Ben Lomond transfer station to Santa Cruz County's BuenaVista landfill in Watsonville. The new center will accept the same types ofmaterials collected at the old Ben Lomond dump, with the exception of filldirt, construction debris and large materials.;    Until the logistics can beworked out, Bolich said, the time-honored tradition of trash salvaging, whichtook place at the Ben Lomond disposal site, will be put on hold and salvagepermits no longer issued.;    &quot;We might reopen that aspect in June, after wefigure out how to safely incorporate salvaging in the new facility,&quot; he said.;   $4 million price tag;  Building a drive-in dump and capping the Ben Lomondlandfill is costing the county more than $4 million, and the price of truckingtrash is steep. The county paid about $540,000 for the three new transfertrucks and trailers it needs to get the refuse and recyclables from the northend of the county to the south. Despite the expense, Bolich said, trashcollection bills aren't expected to rise.;    Residents also will be able toleave recyclable materials in bins next to the new transfer station. Inaddition to dropping off newspapers, aluminum cans, and glass bottles andjars, residents will be able to leave used motor oil in sealed containers,used tires, old mattresses and worn-out appliances.;    In the near future,Bolich said, the facility will begin to accept household hazardous wastematerials on an appointment basis.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TERRI MORGAN, Special to the Mercury News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910422  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  425  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 22, 199100113066,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
