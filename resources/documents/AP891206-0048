(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The evangelist who introduced Jim Bakkerto Jessica Hahn was charged along with a former PTL minister withlying to a special grand jury.   The federal grand jury on Tuesday charged evangelist John WesleyFletcher with one count of perjury for his testimony about howBakker was introduced to Ms. Hahn.   According to the indictment, on Sept. 24, 1987, he denied takingMiss Hahn to a Clearwater Beach, Fla., hotel to have sex withBakker. But, the indictment said, on Sept. 20, 1988, he testifiedthat he agreed when Bakker asked him, ``Get me a woman.''   Sam Johnson, a former minister at PTL's Heritage Village Church,was charged with 12 counts of perjury for his testimony before thespecial grand jury. Johnson's testimony focused on a $10,000 loanhe made to former PTL Executive Vice President Richard Dortch thatlater went to Ms. Hahn.   The payment was made Nov. 1, 1984, before the former churchsecretary received $265,000 in PTL funds in exchange for hersilence about her 1980 sexual encounter with Bakker in a Floridamotel room.   ``We don't expect any further PTL-related indictments from thisgrand jury,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller, whoprosecuted Bakker. He wouldn't elaborate.   The indictments were issued about three hours after Dortch,Bakker's former second in command at PTL, testified to the federalgrand jury.   Dortch, who pleaded guilty in August to fraud and conspiracy forhis role in the PTL affair, had no comment as he left thecourthouse.   Late Tuesday, Dortch's attorneys filed a motion asking U.S.District Judge Robert Potter to reduce Dortch's sentence because ofhis cooperation with prosecutors.   Dortch was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined$200,000. His plea agreement enables the former Assemblies of Godofficial to remain free until federal authorities no longer requirehis cooperation.   According to prosecutors, Dortch had one of his assistantsdeliver $10,000 in an envelope to former PTL board member AimeeCortese, who handed over the money to Miss Hahn during a meeting ata church in New York City in November 1984.   During his two appearances before the special PTL grand jury,Johnson said Dortch had asked him for a $10,000 loan, but Johnsontold the panel he could not remember where he got the money,according to the indictment.   Johnson could not be reached for comment Tuesday. His secretary,Pam Jewett, said he was taping a Christmas TV special in themountains.   Fletcher's number wasn't listed in the Durham telephonedirectory, so attempts to reach him were unsuccessful.   Bakker is serving a 45-year term in a federal prison inMinnesota after being convicted Oct. 5 of fraud and conspiracy.Bakker is appealing the conviction, but a panel of the 4th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals refused to free Bakker on bond while theappeal was prepared.   Bakker was accused of bilking followers who sent him $158million for partnerships in the ministry entitling them to annuallodging guarantees. Prosecutors said Bakker diverted $3.7 millionin PTL money to buy expensive homes, cars, jewelry and vacations.</TEXT></DOC>
