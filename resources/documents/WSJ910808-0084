Their opinions, summarized in the latest report from theFederal Reserve's regional banks, offer further evidence thatthe country's climb out of the recession may not be a strongone.</LP><TEXT>   Retailers in particular said there was little evidence ofstrength in consumer spending. Most of the 12 districtFederal Reserve banks reported that retail sales were flat ordown during June and July. Retailers in the Fed district ofNew York said the heat wave kept shoppers out of their storesunless they happened to need fans or air conditioners. Andhalf the retailers in the Richmond, Va., area told the Fedthey thought the economy was still in a downturn, while fewerthan a third said they thought the recession had ended.   The pickup in home sales that began in the spring alsolost some momentum in the summer, according to people invarious Fed districts. The New York Fed reported that onelarge builder now faces bankruptcy because a loan for a largedevelopment was not renewed.   In a separate sign that consumers aren't yet in a buyingmood, the Fed reported yesterday that consumer credit in Juneregistered its largest drop since January, when the start ofthe Persian Gulf War sent consumers scurrying for cover. Thefigures showed that credit dropped by 3%, or $1.8 billion, inJune. That follows a decline of 2.2%, or $1.3 billion, inMay.   Auto loans posted the sharpest decline during June,falling more than 10%, while mobile home loans increased forthe first time in six months.   The Fed's survey of regional conditions also shows theemployment picture remains mixed around the country.Manufacturers in the Boston region said they plan furtheremployee cuts, mainly through attrition and reductions in theworkweek. The Philadelphia region's manufacturers also planto trim payrolls. Some natural-gas producers in the Atlantaregion said they are scaling back production and thinkingseriously about paring down their work forces. But theCleveland Fed said employment in Ohio rose in three of thepast four months.   The July heat wave apparently took a toll on the farmeconomy, according to the report. In some districts, corn,soybean and cotton growers have had their crops destroyed.But the cattle industry remains strong throughout thecountry, despite a recent drop in prices.   The sentiments expressed in the Fed report underscoreother recent signs that renewed economic growth may befeeble. A report released by the Labor Department Fridayshowed that business payrolls declined by 51,000 in July.   On Tuesday, the Fed lowered short-term interest rates to 51/2% from 5 3/4%, responding to slow money growth andcontinued sluggishness in the economy.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday thatthe lower interest rates will be &quot;helpful&quot; for a &quot;steadygrowth path out of the recession.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
