A U.N. cease-fire team planned to leave for Iran and Iraq thisweekend after Iraq finally agreed Friday to accept it. Iran agreedearlier to welcome the mission.   Iran formally protested Iraq's latest ground offensive and saidIraqi chemical warfare attacks had killed dozens and injuredhundreds.   On Monday, Iran finally accepted Resolution 598, the SecurityCouncil's year-old plan to end the Persian Gulf war. Iraq acceptedit earlier.   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati and his Iraqicounterpart Tariz Aziz agreed to hold separate, intensive talks inNew York with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar onimplementing the plan.   After more than a dozen rounds of fruitless U.N. talks, thisround will be the most crucial, diplomats said. Perez de Cuellarsaid Wednesday he hoped to have a cease-fire in a week or 10 days.   It was not immediately known whether the belligerents would holddirect talks, as urged by Iraq; whether they would hold proximitytalks with Perez de Cuellar shuttling between delegations, orwhether the talks would take place at different times.   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati told reportersthat Velayati might agree to a face-to-face meeting with Aziz.Earlier in the week Mahallati rejected direct talks.   ``Iran is ready to go along without any limitations whatsover inthe implementation of Resolution 598 if the secretary generalrequires it,'' he said.   Perez de Cuellar says he prefers direct talks, but diplomatssaid he was not likely to force the issue.   Velayati is expected to be here Monday, and Aziz also isexpected to arrive early next week. Previously, Iranian envoys fromTehran refused to be here while ranking Iraqi officials met thesecretary-general.   The decision by Iran, militarily battered and politicallyisolated, to accept a cease-fire was a surprise.   Iraq, after a string of battlefield victories, initially calledIran's move a trick and said it would accept a cease-fire onlyafter direct talks with Iran.   But Iraq came under intense diplomatic pressure from manynations, including the Soviet Union, its major arms supplier, andthe United States, to come to terms quickly and agree to acease-fire, said informed diplomatic sources who spoke on conditionof anonymity.   When the secretary-general agreed to call both envoys to NewYork, Iraq agreed to allow the U.N. cease-fire mission to go toBaghdad.   ``I am very optimistic now because the confusion andmisunderstandings have been removed,'' said Ismat Kittani, Iraq'sambassador to the U.N. ``The two foreign ministers will come anddiscuss with the secretary-general how to get the peace processgoing full-blast at the technical level and political level.''   Mahallati said the U.N. team will arrive in Tehran on Sunday.The team then planned to travel to Iraq in its week-long missionbefore reporting back to the secretary-general.   Perez de Cuellar said that after the team returns, he will beable to put Resolution 598 into motion by setting dates for acease-fire, troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange and formal peacetalks and establishing an impartial panel to decide which nationstarted the war.   Iran has insisted that Iraq must be branded the aggressor.Diplomats say Iran needs international condemnation of Iraq topersuade Iranians to accept a cease-fire.   But Resolution 598 is vague on a panel that would determineresponsibility for the war, and diplomatic observers said theyexpected Iraq to try to undercut that provision.   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after several borderskirmishes.   The U.N. technical team will include five officers from the U.N.Truce Supervision Organization based in Jerusalem, two U.N.observers already in both Tehran and Baghdad and a civilianpolitical officer.   Perez de Cuellar said the cease-fire would be monitored by about250 U.N. observers. But he said funding would be a serious problemfor a new U.N. peacekeeping or observer force.   ``Now that the U.N. is engaged in a very major operation, theresoon will be a lack of financial stability and, in fact, almostbankruptcy of the organization,'' he said in a statement. ``Thiswill impair very seriously these new operations.''   The United Nations is facing a crisis of unpaid dues, largelybecause the United States has not paid $467 million, or abouttwo-thirds of the total owed to the world organization by itsmember states.</TEXT></DOC>
