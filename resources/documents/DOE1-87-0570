<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-0570 </DOCNO><TEXT>A mathematical model of the Li-LiAlCl/sub 4/, SOCl/sub 2/-C static cellwith neutral electrolyte is presented. The model considers a whole prismaticcell consisting of negative electrode, separator, electrolyte reservoir,and positive electrode. Physical phenomena described are ohmic potentialdrop and diffusion potential in the electrolyte, changes in porosityand electrolyte composition due to electrochemical reactions, local reactionrates, and diffusion, convection, and migration of electrolyte. The theoreticalresults show the trends in behavior observed experimentally. The effectsof state of charge, initial electrolyte composition, electrode thicknessand porosity, and current density are presented, and factors that canlimit cell performance are identified.</TEXT></DOC>
