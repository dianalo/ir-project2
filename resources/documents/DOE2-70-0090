<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-70-0090 </DOCNO><TEXT>A Liquid Waste Treatment System (LWTS) has been developed to treat thevariety of low level radioactive waste streams being generated from thedecontamination and decommissioning of the former nuclear fuel reprocessingplant at West Valley, New York. The system uses a non-regenerative zeoliteion exchange process to remove and concentrate the radioactive contaminants(i.e., cesium and strontium) from these waste streams. To effectivelyprocess the waste streams of interest, a zeolite mixture has been identifiedas the media of choice. Using 2.5 cm diameter laboratory columns, testinghas been conducted on this mixture to identify and optimize the criticalparameters involved in the successful design and operation of this zeolitesystem. Areas examined included bed preparation requirements, the effectof various process conditions, and system scale-up. Proper bed preparation(e.g., fines and air removal) was found to be particularly importantto the successful operation of the system. The required backwash flowrates and durations were determined. The effects of waste solution chemistryand residence time on the zeolite performance were also examined.</TEXT></DOC>
