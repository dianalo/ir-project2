Wednesday's move follows 800 job cuts late last year, a seniormanagement overhaul and $1 billion in capital infusions by parentAmerican Express Co. to prop up the securities company's financialposition.   Shearson President Howard L. Clark Jr. said the latestreductions are part of a broad cost-cutting program that would savethe company $400 million a year. He said a review of the investmentbank's operations could lead to the elimination of certainbusinesses and the paring down of others.   Shearson officials said the latest layoffs, which will becompleted by the end of March, would occur in all divisions.   ``These steps are necessary to position ourselves for long-termsuccess in the decade ahead,'' said Clark, a former AmericanExpress executive who took over Shearson last month after theouster of Peter A. Cohen, who led the firm's bold expansion in the1980s.   Clark said the cost cutting and business review would result insignificant one-time charges that would depress first-quarterearnings.   As part of the review, he said Shearson would consider shrinkingor closing down businesses, selling entire units, enteringpartnerships in some markets with other Wall Street firms orexpanding in some areas.   One potential union reportedly failed. Wall Street sources saidAmerican Express and Primerica Corp., parent of Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co., held talks about merging some areas to improveoperating efficiency but they ended without a deal this week.   However, The New York Times reported that talks were continuingabout a possible merger of Shearson and Smith Barney, which wouldcreate the nation's largest brokerage.   Under a proposed stock-for-assets swap, Primerica would receivea large portion of American Express' stake in Shearson and the twocompanies would be partners as parents of the merged brokerages,the newspaper said, citing unidentified people involved in thetalks.   Primerica Chairman Sanford I. Weill, the man who built upShearson in the 1970s and sold it to American Express in 1981,would take over as chairman of Shearson, the Times said.   The new layoffs would reduce Shearson's work force to 33,500from a peak of 46,000 in January 1988. The cuts come amid a generalindustry slowdown since the October 1987 stock market crash thathas cost more than 40,000 jobs.   ``Shearson like other firms is readjusting to the new marketrealities,'' said John Kriz, a securities industry analyst withMoody's Investors Service Inc.   Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical Services said he expectedShearson to cut up to 3,000 more jobs this year and reduce itsreliance on businesses such as investment banking and trading infavor of retail brokerage.   The latest cuts came two days after American Express said itwould inject $750 million into Shearson to shore up its finances,following a $250 million infusion in December. In return, AmericanExpress increased its ownership stake in Shearson.   Analysts said the injection was designed to quell widespreadrumors on Wall Street about Shearson's financial conditionfollowing the recent collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   American Express had planned to shore up Shearson's finances andreduce its stake in the brokerage to about 45 percent from 61percent under a complex recapitalization plan involving the issueof $250 million of new Shearson stock. But weak market conditionsforced the company to abandon the offering.   Long estimated the new infusion would give American Expressabout 72 percent of Shearson. But he said if Shearson's financialposition improves, the parent still would need to consider whetherto sell the firm, spin it off to shareholders or assume 100 percentownership.</TEXT></DOC>
