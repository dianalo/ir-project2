The Tokyo market was closed for the second day of a three-day holiday.    London's Financial Times 30-share index fell 11.6 to 1438.1. Volume was a moderate 427.4 million shares, compared with 335 million Tuesday. The 100-share index was off 12.5 to close at 1794.7, its intraday low.    Wall Street also opened lower, adding to the decline in London, dealers said. Some said the bearish tone was set early in the London session when Britain's Department of Trade and Industry said it would refer the Kuwait Investment Office's purchase of 22% of British Petroleum shares to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission, citing possible anti-competitive and national security implications.    The announcement cooled the takeover speculation that had fueled a recent market rise, as dealers said the government's move could signal a harder line on takeover bids and accumulations of big stakes.    Oil shares ended mostly lower. BP was down 6 pence at 266 pence ($4.97) a share, Shell Transport andamp; Trading fell 3 to 1,060, and Lasmo dropped 10 to 414. Consolidated Gold Fields, which rose 35 Tuesday on takeover speculation, eased 22 to 968 on profit-taking. One dealer said the market began to doubt the possibility of a bid for the company.    Several &quot;brand-name&quot; stocks that were in demand last week because of brokerages' strong buy recommendations and takeover talk were dumped yesterday.    Reckitt andamp; Colman eased 15 to 864, and Cadbury-Schweppes fell 18 to 330. English China Clays, however, rose 22 to 451 on speculation that cash-rich RTZ, a mining and energy concern, may bid for it. RTZ was down 3 at 382.    Pearson, an information, banking and industrial conglomerate, was up 25 at 706. Analysts said two large blocks of Pearson shares were bought by an unidentified institution. There also were conflicting rumors that media owner and investor Rupert Murdoch was about to either raise or reduce his 20.4% stake in Pearson.    Frankfurt's rally was accompanied by increased trading volume after chemicals group Hoechst posted a 20% jump in first-quarter pretax profit, a far better report than expected. Hoechst rose 5.80 to 255.80 marks ($152.34) a share.    Two large chemicals concerns that are due to report first-quarter earnings next week also gained, with Bayer up 3.70 to 265.50 and BASF rising 3.20 to 242.40.    Steel and machinery shares profited from Tuesday's agreement, reached by steelmakers Fried. Krupp and Mannesmann and West German trade unions, to close a steel plant in Duisburg-Rheinhausen by 1990. The accord ended months of debate and strikes.    Hoesch rose 7.90 to 129, Mannesmann climbed 6 to 142.50, and Thyssen moved up 5.60 to 136. In the machinery sector, Linde rose 4.50 to 635.00, and M.A.N. firmed 1 to 176.    Auto maker Daimler-Benz jumped 9 to 612, and Bayerische Motoren Werke added 8.50 to 509.50. Volkswagen edged up 0.70 to 238.70.    In the electrical sector, Siemens recovered some of the loss it had Tuesday, when it reported a 9% decline in first-half group profit. The stock firmed 4.70 to 337.50. AEG climbed 2.40 to 210.40.    In Sydney, Australian resource shares extended their retreat after gold prices declined further Tuesday and the Australian dollar soared to a three-year high. But the broader market finished above its lows as early selling pressure abated.    The All-Ordinaries index, which fell 11.3 Tuesday, slipped 1.5 to 1443.2. Brokers said some foreign investors sold stocks to realize currency gains on the recent rise of the Australian dollar. The currency was quoted late in the day in Sydney at 77.09 U.S. cents.    Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's largest listed stock, was 8 cents higher at 7.58 Australian dollars ($5.84) a share. Bell Group, which was off 7 Tuesday, fell 3 cents to 1.70 dollars. But its 43%-controlled affiliate, Bell Resources, gained 5 to 1.74 dollars. Mr. Murdoch's News Corp. slipped 15 cents to 13.95 dollars.    Elsewhere, shares were higher in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, Manila, Paris, Zurich, Milan and Brussels. Prices were mixed in Amsterdam and lower in Seoul, Wellington and Stockholm. Gold stocks were lower in Johannesburg.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                     % This                                  May 3    May 2     Year U.S. ........................... 241.7    240.4    +  5.3 Britain ........................ 543.0    541.0    +  4.9 Canada ......................... 367.8    366.5    +  4.9 Japan ......................... 1307.2   1307.2    + 27.9 France ......................... 319.9    319.1    + 10.9 Germany ........................ 163.7    165.4    +  4.6 Hong Kong ..................... 1866.7   1860.4    + 13.5 Switzerland .................... 148.5    149.2    +  5.6 Australia ...................... 285.8    288.6    + 10.2 World index .................... 460.7    459.1    + 12.9</TEXT></DOC>
