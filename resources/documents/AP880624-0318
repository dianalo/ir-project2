(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Top management of Payless Cashways Inc.offered to acquire the building materials company for $875 millionin an apparent effort to discourage unwanted attention from NewYork investor Asher B. Adelman.   A group headed by Payless chairman David Stanley offered to pay$26 a share for the company's 33.6 million shares of common stockoutstanding.   The management offer pre-empts any attempt at making a bid byEdelman, who has been building a stake in Payless and has said hemight be interested in bidding for the nation's third-largestbuilding materials retailer.   Stanley, who is also chief executive, and other members ofmanagement acknowledged two weeks ago they were considering abuyout.   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Payless Cashways rose$2.62{ a share to $25.62{. It was one of the 10 most-active issues.   Edelman amassed his stake with Sutherland Lumber-Southwest Inc.of Kansas City, a privately owned Payless competitor that operatesabout 86 building materials stores in Midwest and Southern states.   At one point the Edelman group held about 9.9 percent ofPayless's outstanding shares but has recently been reducing itsholdings, which now account for about 8.1 percent of the company'sshares.   Perry Sutherland, an executive in Sutherland Lumber, said thegroup was still interested in acquiring Payless.   The Payless management group said it has received commitments tofinance the entire offer, which would be structured as a leveragedbuyout. In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy acompany and then pay off the debt with the target company's cashflow or the sale of its assets.   The group headed by Stanley owned less than 2 percent of thecompany stock at the time of the last proxy statement on Feb. 25.   Payless said a special committee of independent directors formedto consider takover proposals would evaluate the proposal.   Payless serves the home improvement, maintenance and repairmarket with 200 retail stores in 26 states.   Other managers involved in the offer include Larry P. Kunz,president and chief operating officer, and Melvin Cohen and HaroldCohen, co-chairmen of Somerville Lumber and Supply Inc., a Paylesssubsidiary.   The Edelman group had said in a filing with the Securities andExchange Commission that it would consider selling Paylessoperations as ``going concerns'' in many regions of the country.   Bruce Benteman, a research analyst at the securities firm WealthMonitors Inc., said he didn't expect Edelman to make a seriouscounteroffer for Payless. Benteman said Edelman had probably soldoff more Payless stock since the last report.</TEXT></DOC>
