Sakharov wasburied today in the cold earth of the Russia he tried so hard tochange, mourned by tens of thousands of countrymen and praised bythe leadership that once reviled him.   ``It's over,'' Sakharov's wife and dissident comrade-in-arms,Yelena Bonner, said as she turned to a companion during thetwilight burial in a Moscow cemetery.   Before Sakharov's crimson- and black-trimmed coffin was loweredinto the ground at Vostryakovskoye Cemetery, its cover was removedto allow Bonner to bid a final farewell. She removed the shroudfrom his face and bent to kiss him on the forehead.   Sakharov, who died Thursday of an apparent heart attack at theage of 68, he was buried alongside Bonner's mother, Ruth, aStalin-era political prisoner who died in 1987 at age 87.   Top party brass riding sleek black limousines and tens ofthousands of common people trudging through the slush joined inpaying their last respects to the Nobel laureate.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other ruling Politburomembers stood in icy morning rain to view the body outside theAcademy of Sciences, to which Sakharov, a creator of the Soviethydrogen bomb, belonged. Gorbachev spoke at length with Bonner.   ``Now it is clear that he deserved the Nobel Prize,'' Gorbachevtold reporters. Sakharov was denied permission to travel to Norwayto accept the 1975 prize for his human rights campaign. He washounded for years and finally banished into internal exile by pastSoviet leaders.   Some marchers carried protest signs demanding democraticelections, echoing the final cause of Sakharov before he died lastweek. Others hoisted the blue-red-white flag of czarist Russia, nowthe symbol of the grassroots pro-democracy Russian People's Front.   More than 8,000 grieving Soviets followed Sakharov's body,transported in an open-ended bus that also carried Bonner alongLenin Prospekt to outdoor funeral ceremonies at Luzhniki sportscomplex. The southern Moscow facility is a favorite site forrallies by human rights activists.   In the Kremlin, the 2,250-member Soviet Congress to whichSakharov belonged adjourned at midday so its members could attendthe ceremony.   State-run television showed excerpts of the service in a specialbroadcast of the kind usually reserved for the deaths of majorgovernment figures.   At the outdoor service, the crowd surged dangerously forwardtoward Sakharov's coffin and Bonner had to plead for order. Thecoffin was then transported nine miles in a bus along slush-filledstreets to the cemetery.   In the afternoon, tens of thousands of mourners gathered at theLuzhniki stadium parking lot for a memorial service.   Sakharov ``did all he could,'' said Ilya Zaslavsky, a Moscowmember of the Soviet Congress. ``Now only his ideas can changethings, and only we can fulfill his ideas.''   Other parliamentarians pledged to heed Sakharov's call to createa full-fledged opposition in the Congress and to push for victoryfor progressives in local elections.   ``The best wreath for Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov is to win overconservatives in the March elections,'' said economist and deputyGavriil Popov.   Lech Walesa, the leader of Poland's Solidarity movement andwinner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, had been expected to attendthe funeral, but Poland's official PAP news agency reported thathis plane had to land in Leningrad because of bad weather.   Gorbachev and other top Soviet officials, including Politburomembers Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, AlexanderN. Yakovlev and Vadim A. Medvedev arrived at the Academy ofSciences building in Moscow in the morning to view Sakharov's body.   From another direction, buses escorted by police cars arrived.Some 20 people bore a closed casket on their shoulders from a bus,and placed it on a platform in front of the academy. Bonner alsoemerged, accompanied by her son Alexei Semenov.   The coffin was opened in the frigid rain, and an umbrella openedto shield Sakharov's face.   Gorbachev walked to the foot of the casket, and stood for awhilein silence. He then nodded, and the huddle of people around thecasket broke up.   Sakharov's body was placed back on the bus and taken to theLebedev Physics Institute, where Sakharov worked.   ``His only wish was for the state to have a human face,''Academician Yevgeny L. Feynberg said of his fellow physicist ascolleagues at the institute filed past the casket.   Outside the Academy of Sciences, Gorbachev and Bonner spokeanimatedly, with Bonner smiling at one point. Gorbachev and hisentourage entered the academy building to sign an official book ofcondolences. The Soviet leader simply wrote ``M.S. Gorbachev.''   He emerged, and talked briefly with repoters. ``The relationsbetween myself and Sakharov were always those of mutual respect,''Gorbachev said. ``Now it is clear that he deserved the NobelPrize.''   It was Gorbachev who allowed Sakharov to return to Moscow inDecember 1986 after nearly seven years of internal exile in thecity of Gorky. The two men had clashed, however, over the speed andsweep of Gorbachev's political reform program, with Sakharovdemanding the Communist Party that Gorbachev heads renounce itsconstitutional monopoly on power.   Moscow News _ an organ of the official press which once brandedSakharov an ``utterly ignorant person'' _ took the rare step Sundayof publishing a special edition devoted to the activist.   It included a text of Sakharov's last public remarks, a speechhe delivered hours before his death in which he said the Soviethierarchy was ``leading the country to a catastrophe.''</TEXT></DOC>
