Police said one man was killed and another captured after threegunmen in a jeep fired on a police car in suburban Quezon Cityduring the fireworks display.   Meanwhile, communist guerrillas killed a woman and her two sons,and government soldiers gunned down three rebels in separateincidents over the weekend, the news agency and the military said.   Sgt. Manny Siocon said the attack in Quezon apparently waslinked to the fireworks display. He said the third assailantescaped and police recovered a rifle, flares and bundles offireworks from the gunmen's vehicle.   Police and residents said the fireworks began about 8:30 p.m. atmilitary camps in the Manila area and lasted up to 15 minutes.   A member of the Presidential Security Group told The AssociatedPress the fireworks explosions could also be heard near thepresidential palace.   Columnist Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc wrote in the pro-governmentPhilippine Daily Inquirer Sunday that a group called theRevolutionary Association for the People's Freedom would explodefireworks across the nation to signal ``the birthing of a Filipinomovement to free the nation now mired in greed and looting.''   There were no reports of displays elsewhere in the country, butMrs. Magsanoc said pamphlets published by the previously unknowngroup called for ``dismantling of the transitional exploitativegovernment,'' a reference to the Aquino administration. Police saidthey accept the journalist's explanation, but refused furthercomment.   She said the fireworks would honor the leaders of a bloody Aug.28, 1987, coup attempt, in which renegade soldiers led by formerLt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan tried to topple the Aquinogovernment. At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 werewounded in the coup attempt.   Honasan was captured in December but escaped in April from aprison ship in Manila Bay and remains at large.   He played a key role in the February 1986 military revolt thattoppled President Ferdinand Marcos and propelled Mrs. Aquino topower.   But Honasan became disillusioned with Mrs. Aquino for heralleged failure to crush the 19-year Communist insurgency andrestore an honest, democratic administration.   In Capiz on Panay island about 200 miles south of Manila,guerrillas Saturday strafed the house of Boday Hulido, 30, killingher and her two sons, the Philippines News Agency said. It said therebels may have been looking for Hulido's husband, who had justbeen recruited into a new militia force.

Antonio Zaldua said the soldiers were sent to thevillage after receiving reports that rebels were allegedly askingresidents for money.   The soldiers recovered firearms, medicines, foodstuff and aradio transmitter from the scene of the firefight, the officialsaid. No government casualties were reported.
