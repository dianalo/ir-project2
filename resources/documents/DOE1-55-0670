Method: For the safety inspection of thedry well, the reactor power is reduced to render the reactor in a subcriticalstate. However, since the steams in the reactor are discharged to a condensator,the temperature of the reactor water is lowered. Then, if the temperatureof the reactor water is reduced, the density of the water is increasedto increase the neutron moderating efficiency to add a positive reactivityto the reactor. In view of the above, the reactor again turns to thepower-increasing trend, providing dangerous states for the working. Inview of the above, the reactor power has always been monitored and controlrods have been inserted additionally. In the present invention, afterclosing the main steam drain valve and attaining the subcriticality bythe insertion of the control rods, the recycling pumps are operated andthe temperature of the reactor water is elevated by the heat generatedfrom pumps and motors thereby suppressing the lowering in the temperatureof the reactor water. In this way, the withdrawal amount of the controlrod can be decreased to enable reactor recovery in a short period oftime. (Kamimura, M.).</TEXT></DOC>
