The National Aeronautics and Space Administration contract runs for six years with a three-year option for renewal. The software system will be developed for primary use at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.    The Reagan administration has directed NASA to start work on a space station to orbit Earth at an altitude of 200 to 250 miles. The station, which would be resupplied by space shuttles, would be used as a laboratory with astronauts living there for as long as 90 days. A spokesman for Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed said the estimated $14 billion project is targeted for 1996. </TEXT></DOC>
