In interviews with The Associated Press, three Estoniandelegates described what they said were efforts dating back to lastfall to work out a political and economic program giving therepublic independence over its economy, ecology, education andculture.   The program has been summarized in the platform of Estonia's 32delegates to the party conference, who said it has been wellreceived by influential reformers in Moscow.   ``The Soviet leadership supports it, I know,'' said Johan Aare,one of Estonia's most popular television journalists and leader ofa Greens ecology movement born in the small republic last month.   Mikhail Bronstein, an economics professor at Estonia's historicTartu university, said the ideas in the republic's platform wereworked out unofficially by intellectuals in discussions thatstarted months ago.   Estonia was the first of the three Baltic republics to form aNational Front in support of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's``perestroika,'' or restructuring. Lithuania has followed suit,while hundreds of Latvian intellectuals have formulated demands forsovereignty extending to independent membership for their republicin the United Nations and their own team at the Olympics.   The intellectuals also worked out a more detailed program foreconomic independence known by the acronym of IME, which means``miracle'' in Estonian, Bronstein said.   At first, he said, conservatives attacked the program andaccused Estonian nationals of seeking secession from the SovietUnion.   ``On the contrary, we see this as the only chance ofstrengthening the Soviet Union along Leninist principles of equalrights, sovereignty and a federation,'' Bronstein said.   Both he and Aare said they see a federation as the only path todevelop their republic and to help keep the Soviet Unioncompetitive.   ``The tempo of growth is what is important,'' Aare said. ``Ifthere was just one state in the world, it wouldn't matter. But ifthere are other states moving faster right by your side, you cannotlag behind.''   Estonians often compare their standard of living with that ofneighboring Finland, which has a prosperous, Western-style economy.   Both men conceded it might be difficult to create a federationin the Soviet Union when the 15 republics that make up the countryhave such diverse histories and levels of development.   Central Asian republics moved from near-feudal circumstances tosocialism after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Bronstein said. Bycontrast, Estonia and the Baltic republics of Lithuania and Latviadeveloped under centuries of domination by the prosperous HanseaticLeague, he said.   But they appeared convinced their ideas will win Kremlinapproval.   ``It is necessary to work carefully, thoroughly,diplomatically,'' said Aare. ``But we have a program, that's theimportant thing.''   The two men gave the impression that Estonian intellectuals havemade a careful, well-planned effort to use Gorbachev's reforms tobring about change in their republic.   They also stressed that demands to make Estonian the officiallanguage and to improve education in Estonian culture are notdirected against the tens of thousands of ethnic Russians broughtinto the republic since World War II to man industry.   Just over half of Estonia's 1.56 million citizens are Estonians,compared with 90 percent in 1940, when Soviet troops seized thethree Baltic republics under a secret protocol to Moscow's 1939pact with Nazi Germany.   Russian immigration, maintenance of indigenous culture and thespoiling of the environment by post-World War II industry are ofgrowing concern to citizens of the Baltic republics.   Aare said Estonian intellectuals criticized the then-leader ofEstonia's Communists, Karl G. Vaino, and decided to unite in aNational Front, which he said has since gained the support of tensof thousands of the republic's 1.5 million people.   Bronstein said the Estonians want the right to open their ownoffices in Scandinavian countries and the United States to furthertrade and maintain contacts with emigres.   Emigres from the Baltic republics have been reviled in officialmedia as enemies of socialism who want to restore the ``bourgeoisdemocracy'' that ruled before Soviet troops seized the threeterritories in 1940.   Indrek Toome, the Communist Party secretary in charge ofideology in Estonia, said it would be important to give theNational Front, the Greens and any other mass social movementswhich emerge a constitutional right to exist.</TEXT></DOC>
