They've made&quot;blight&quot; a synonym for &quot;billboard.&quot; Who could be against beauty?;    But thinkagain.;    Billboards a blight? No -- they aren't a debilitating urbandisease, they're the most lively and useful parts of our streetscape. Theyshow the city's productivity, diversity, vitality.;    Billboards aspollution? Come on -- noxious chemicals in the air and water are one thing,pretty pictures of new cars and candy bars are another.;    Billboards toocommercial? So what? Every building in the entire city -- banks, offices,convention centers, even churches -- sells one thing or another.;    Turn downthe rhetoric. Drop these red herring from future discussion of billboards.;   Why do billboards provoke such outrage? They are a lightning rod for all thepopulist, commercial forces that shape cities today. They're a symbol that theold elites -- architectural, governmental, cultural -- have lost control overthe way the city looks. Instead of Daniel Burnham's imperial City Beautiful orLe Corbusier's rational Radiant City, today's American city is a form of massmedia. Instead of expressing the elite's taste and reserve, cities today showoff a rainbow of tastes, good, bad and indifferent.;    Pass this bill andleave a voiceless city. It couldn't speak -- or boast -- about its variety,its vitality, its interest. It would also be a city without rhythm, color,splash, glitter. Don't count on conventional architecture to fill the gap inproviding wonder, humor and startling sights for our streets.;    It's time totake a fresh look at billboards.;    Super structures;  First of all there'sthe billboard's structure itself. Drive El Camino Real through Santa Clara andyou'll see muscular columns effortlessly lifting tremendous signboards severalstories into the air. While you're stopped at a traffic light sometime, take acloser look. They're often cantilevered over a store with a breathtakingdaring absent in other architecture. They have the same graceful directnessthat strictly functional designs like bridges and dams have.;    Look at thebillboard itself. Not all are beautiful, admittedly. Not all churches areChartres, either. But at their best billboards are spectacular. Images ofsleek sports cars float like a dream against the sunset sky. Lettuces as bigas bungalows hover like overhead landmarks. Wierdstuff's neon-nerd graphicsand highway graffiti show the cultural range the form is capable of.;    Andin an era when the bucolic past of the Valley of Heart's Delight is but amemory and most architecture looks like Anywhere, U.S.A., only a recentCalistoga billboard conjured up a Grant Wood vision of Santa Clara's vanishedorchards and farms. For months, this glorious sylvan reminder was plastered onbillboards all over town.;    With these overscaled images from advertisingheaven, it's no wonder that billboards inspired pop art. They place ordinaryobjects in extraordinary places and inflate them to godlike dimensions. In oureveryday lives they are picture windows to exotic lands. Few pop artists everachieved the power of the originals, though. Ugly? Visual pollution? No way.;   We need billboards. Not everywhere -- not billboards on Half Dome; not neonsigns on the Golden Gate Bridge. But we need pictures and images that addvariety to our public streets.;    But the biggest argument againstanti-billboard laws is that they just don't work. Previous attempts to limitroadside-sign size, shape and lighting in the name of tastefulness onlyproduced today's crop of illegible ladder signs commonly seen at corner malls.One skimpy signboard piles on top of the next. Every word is the same size.Instead of big and bold, they're small and unreadable. And there's nothingmore useless than an unreadable sign. Thanks, Taste Police.;    Earlier thiscentury, fresher eyes saw the possibilities in billboards as an exciting newmeans of urban communication in the Automotive Age. Architect Richard Neutralined the roof of his sophisticated 1933 Universal Pictures building inHollywood with elegant billboards advertising the studio's latest releases. Inearlier centuries, entire facades of Gothic churches were laden with mosaicstelling stories of saints and prophets -- a billboard by any other name.;   And that's what billboards still do: Tell a story about who we are and what welike. You may not like the story. You may find it tasteless. But thecommercial strips where billboards congregate are the only place (besidescable TV) where all classes go. It demands that we confront other people,other tastes -- even those we dislike.;    The Taste Police know what theylike and they want the rest of us to like it too, if we know what's good forus. Sign companies have put up a wishy-washy defense mumbling about propertyrights. No one's talking about what billboards really are and what they do ina city. They're messy, gaudy, crowded and brash. But they are the newest andmost vital form of the city's oldest purpose -- to communicate.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Alan Hess column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910707  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  930  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 7, 199100189105,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
