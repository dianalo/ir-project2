Until last week, the 25-year-old Toyota Motor Co. employee fit neatly into an orderly corporate structure. He reported to a section chief, who reported to a division chief, and so on up the line. After a couple of decades, a patient Mr. Hashimoto himself might have expected to ascend to section or division chief.    Suddenly, though, there are no section chiefs at Toyota. Worried that management was bogged down by the swollen number of middle-aged, white-collar workers getting automatic seniority promotions, Toyota last week abruptly eliminated two tiers of middle-ranking positions. With the shift, about 1,000 people were reassigned, many to lower-level jobs. The move had the double effect of eliminating inefficient layers of bureaucracy and averting top-heaviness in management. It also should prepare the company to deal with thinning numbers of younger workers.    Mr. Hashimoto is delighted at the change. Though he may have to wait longer to get into upper management, he now has fewer people looking over his shoulder and more-direct access to top people. &quot;Before, the &quot;kacho&quot; (section chief) just gave instructions,&quot; the third-year employee says. &quot;From now on, we can ask him to move the pencil a bit, too. Now, I feel that we're people working together.&quot;    The collegial approach welcomed by Mr. Hashimoto once would have been heresy in Japan's hierarchical corporate world. Far from an egalitarian society, Japan's business world still relies heavily on rank and tenure; titles such as kacho have tended to denote longevity rather than managerial expertise. But change is afoot, and not just at Toyota.    Like many U.S. corporations, Japan Inc. is doing away with layers of middle management in hopes of improving efficiency. But beyond efficiency, the revamping of some renowned Japanese employment practices also reflects shifting demographics. With the bulk of the country's work force now passing through middle age, Japanese companies are fretting about how to sidestep seniority systems for older employees and how to win new, young employees, who are becoming a rare commodity. In a country where rigid structures are the norm, a little less rigidity is probably attractive to young people.    &quot;Right now, Japan has too many chiefs and too few Indians,&quot; says an executive recruiter for one U.S. firm in Tokyo. And the situation isn't improving. &quot;Anybody who can read a population chart can tell you that these numbers aren't going to go away,&quot; says Dan Maher, co-head of consulting at Chuo Coopers andamp; Lybrand K.K.    Japan's most recent population statistics show a big bulge in the age group between 35 and 39 years old. Nearly one in 10 Japanese falls into that small bracket, and almost a third of all Japanese are between 30 and 50 years old. Moreover, the pool of young people is drying up: Only one in 12 Japanese will be joining the work force in the next five years.    Companies are feeling the rising age curve. At Nissan Motor Co. the average age of employees today is 38.1 years, up from 33.9 in 1979. As the average age rises, more and more workers expect to get automatically promoted to managerial positions.    At some companies, employees are promoted by rote to managerial positions with nobody working under them. Some even end up without responsibilities themselves, and become known as &quot;madogiwa zoku,&quot; or window-side sitters, because they have nothing to do but gaze out the window.    Nissan was one of the first to act on the growing managerial problem. Four years ago, the auto maker began dropping the courtesy titles, like kacho, that employees attached to their supervisors' names, hoping to reduce the pressure on automatic promotions. And more recently, Nissan told workers it will base promotions on ability, rather than tenure.    A smaller Japanese company, die-cast maker Ryobi Ltd., has taken an even more direct approach: It bases middle managers' salaries on performance. That may sound standard to Western ears, but in the land of lifetime employment, salaries traditionally have been determined by length of tenure. A Ryobi spokesman says the move is intended to &quot;activate&quot; managers and to spur initiative.    The move by Toyota is the most severe effort yet to steer out of the traditional seniority-promotion system. Not only did the company eliminate the titles of 1,000 middle managers, but it flattened out some vertical management structures to reduce the number of people and bureaucratic steps involved in key business decisions and strategies. The company says that quick decision-making is important, particularly for getting new car models off the drawing board and into production.    &quot;By eliminating titles, the organization becomes more flexible,&quot; says Yoshihisa Murasawa, a vice president at Booz-Allen andamp; Hamilton (Japan) Inc., consultants. &quot;Business is becoming much more complex, and it was too easy for decisions to fall between different sections in the same company.&quot; At the same time that Japanese companies are finding they have too many workers of middle-manager age, they're suffering from a lack of young blood. As a result, competition to lure new workers is intense. Today, there are nearly 130 job offers for every 100 applicants in Japan, and major universities report that graduating seniors have an average of three job offers from which to choose.    With such rosy prospects and a booming Japanese economy, young workers have the luxury of becoming picky with what job they take. More surprising, they are willing to desert jobs they don't like, a major break from the past.    &quot;People's values are changing,&quot; says Yoshiaki Noguchi, a business strategy consultant at ODS Corp. For decades, Japanese have tended to stick with the same employer until retirement. Nowadays, with Japan's affluence rising, workers are more concerned with their own lives, and less concerned with their employers. &quot;There's a lot less loyalty towards companies,&quot; Mr. Noguchi says. &quot;Job-hopping is becoming natural.&quot;    Adds Booz-Allen's Mr. Murasawa: &quot;People take it for granted that there is money and Japan is affluent. Loyalties are to jobs, not companies.&quot;    That fact is forcing companies to improve the conditions they offer to new employees. Young, single workers traditionally have tended to live in company dormitories, mainly because of sky-high real estate and consumer prices in Tokyo. Now, many big companies are polishing up those company apartments in hopes of winning and keeping new workers.    Along with announcing the middle-management changes, Toyota last week said it would commit 100 billion yen ($714.8 million) to improve employee residences. And Nikko Securities Co. raised 100 billion yen through a new share issue, of which 43.7 billion yen is earmarked to upgrade employee quarters with telephones, satellite television and health centers. Nikko also hopes to double the average size of its employee dormitory rooms to about 100 square feet.    &quot;In some dormitories, space was so, so small,&quot; says Yuko Onuma, a spokeswoman for Nikko. &quot;Employees have come to expect help from their companies, so we have done this.&quot;    Analysts say the Japanese efforts to adjust to the new demographics will continue, and take many different forms. Notes Coopers andamp; Lybrand's Mr. Maher: &quot;There's probably as many ways as there are companies.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
