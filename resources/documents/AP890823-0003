WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Women around the country see a new female-majoritygovernment in West Berlin as a sign of a new age in West Germany anda test case that could influence their political fortunes in thefuture.   Women hold eight of the 13 seats in the West Berlin Senate, thecity's governing body.   While the coalition of leftist Social Democrats andenvironmentalists has held together better than many had predictedwhen it took office in March, it has been tainted by controversy.   Anne Klein, the state minister for youth affairs, has beenaccused of taking part in illegal gambling activities.   Culture Minister Anke Martiny has come under fire in the pressfollowing allegations that one of her women staffers misused officecontacts and mailing privileges to secure an apartment.   But women defenders respond that what happened to the women isnothing more than the kind of trouble men get into.   ``I wouldn't want to understate the seriousness of such matters,but it's fair to say that they are not problems specific to womenpoliticians,'' said Ingrid Hesse, a spokeswoman for the SocialDemocratic Women's Organization, an arm of the Social DemocraticParty, which governs in coalition with an environmentalist group.   ``The fact that a woman is discovered to have taken part insomething questionable doesn't detract from the undeniableimportance of this huge step forward for women,'' Ms. Hesse added.   Peter Rudolph, a taxi driver in his 50s, tended to agree.   ``People are always looking for excuses to complain about thegovernment, especially now with all those women,'' he said. ``Theyaren't doing anything the male politicians weren't doing, buteveryone notices now.''   The eight women senators caucus over croissants and coffee eachTuesday morning in a ritual that has been called the ``WitchesBreakfast.''   ``It is really quite productive, and it lets all these women blowoff steam so that it doesn't interfere with the whole Senate'sbusiness,'' said Alice Uebe, chief adviser to Ms. Martiny and anactive the Social Democrat.   The women are credited with pressing for changes aimed atimproving living conditions in this city of 2 million people tightlyringed by communist East Germany.   They have introduced measures to reduce air and noise pollution,improve housing availability and to expand day-care opportunitiesfor the increasing numbers of West German women who work outside thehome.   While many Berliners attribute the atmospheric changes to thewomen's influence, they likewise are blamed for decisions and edictsthat don't sit well with the public.   West Berlin's interior minister, Erich Paetzold, decided in Julyto require that official correspondence be gender-neutral. Forexample, a male resident is a Berliner, and a female is aBerlinerin. The unisex term is BerlinerIn, with the second ``i''capitalized.   What has become known as the ``Big I'' decision has been widelyridiculed as silliness resulting from the female majority in theSenate. Hanna-Renate Laurien, a former senator of the out-of-powerChristian Democratic Union, called it ``perverse.''   Monika Herrmann, one of the founding members of the women-onlyArtemisia Hotel and art gallery in West Berlin, says the newgovernment has awakened the West German women's movement.   But she and others also maintained that it has left some menfeeling defensive and threatened.   ``For a long time many people have confused emancipation withsexual alternativism,'' Ms. Herrmann said in an interview. ``Womenare doing things for themselves, and men fear their power is beingreduced.''   A member of the city government's 35-women advisory council onfamily and social affairs, Ms. Herrmann said the women in positionsof authority now recognize that they have to move carefully toachieve what they want without undermiing their electoral support.   Meanwhile, women politicians in other parts of the country keep aclose eye on West Berlin to gauge their own standing with voters.   ``The Berliners have given the situation for political women astep up, but we are seeing this in other areas of the country aswell, in smaller cities,'' observed Ingrid Sehrbrock, director ofthe Women's Union of the Christian Democatic Union. ``What kind ofexample the Berlin coalition poses remains to be seen, but it hascertainly raised everyone's consciousness.''</TEXT></DOC>
