But supporters of a statewide limit on lighting up cigarettes,cigars and pipes in stores, offices and other public places plan tomeet with representatives of the tobacco industry next month in anunprecedented effort to reach a compromise over the failed cleanindoor air bill of 1989.   ``We did agree that there would be no smoking at the meeting,''said Anne Donley, executive director of Virginia GASP _ Group toAlleviate Smoking in Public. ``I think it's certainly historic thatthe tobacco industry is sitting down and talking with health groupsabout this.''   Paige Sutherland, the Tobacco Institute's regional director,said, ``We're willing to consider some type of restriction onpublic smoking at the statewide level in lieu of any additionalordinances at the local level.''   The industry that supports Virginia's leading agricultural cropmounted a massive offensive at the General Assembly session earlierthis year to defeat a proposal to limit public smoking.   The bill proposed by Sen. Thomas J. Michie Jr. and DelegateBernard S. Cohen would have banned smoking in elevators andhospital emergency rooms and required no-smoking areas in largegrocery stores and government buildings.   But lawmakers, pressed by a $100,000-plus lobbying campaign bytobacco backers, turned down the plan and instead passed a one-yearmoratorium, effective July 1, on local no-smoking ordinances thatapply to private industry.   According to Sutherland, anti-tobacco advocates are ``hounding''local government bodies to adopt something before the July 1 cutoff.   On Tuesday, the Newport News City Council approved an ordinancethat limits smoking in stores, theaters, restaurants and otherpublic places. Portsmouth City Council is considering passing suchan ordinance before July 1.   About a dozen localities already have such regulations.   Ms. Donley said she believes the tobacco industry would like tosee the moratorium extended indefinitely. But she said businessgroups such as retailers, hotel and restaurant operators arekeeping an open mind.   Sutherland said complaints that tobacco companies have beenunyielding in opposition to smoking restrictions are unfair.   ``We're always portrayed as the bad guy,'' he said. ``That'ssimply not true.   ``We're reasonable business people. Our product is legal and itmakes a substantial contribution to the economy,'' he said. ``We'rewilling to meet with them and get down to trying to hammer out anaccord.''   The meeting tentatively has been set for June 20 in the downtownRichmond office of Anthony F. Troy, a lawyer and former stateattorney general who is a lobbyist for the Tobacco Institute.   Sutherland said an industry-prepared draft of proposedlegislation would be given to Michie and Cohen at the meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
