The friendly offer for the hospital company, organized byminority shareholder Dr. M. Lee Pearce of Miami, is valued by theofferer at $24 a share. Of that, $21 a share is cash and the restin securities.   Clayton andamp; Dubilier, a private firm that financed the $960million management buyout of Colgate Palmolive Co.'s Kendall Co. inOctober, leads the buyout group, according to AMI.   A special committee of the company's board is studying theoffer, AMI said in a news release.   The potential buyers set a June 15 deadline, and indicated theywere willing to negotiate for a higher price, AMI said.   Pearce, one of several shareholders who have been pressing thecompany to boost its earnings and stock price, first offered to buythe company in March.
