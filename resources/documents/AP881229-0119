Police and fire sirens roared and many motorists stopped theircars and honked in Lima and other cities to usher in a ``minute ofsilence for peace.''   Thousands elsewhere in Lima froze in their tracks on downtown andsuburban streets for a moment of private reflection, but many othersothers went about their business, ignoring the event.   Officials say nearly 2,000 people have died in the leftistinsurgency of the Shining Path guerrilla group since the firstnationwide peace vigil was held exactly one year ago.   ``Too much blood has been spilled. This is both a silentinvitation and the clamor of the multitudes. We want peace,''Cardinal Juan Landazuri said in a nationally televised speech.   Lima's Municipal Palace, where Landazuri spoke in a ceremonyattended by dozens of the nation's leaders, was guarded by scores ofheavily armed police, a stark reminder of the possibility of aterror attack.   Riot police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse a noonmarch near the Municipal Palace of about 300 members of theConfederation of State Laborers, said reporters on the scene.   The protesters said they were marching to demand that authoritiesrelease a confederation leader arrested three weeks ago. Police havedenied the man was detained.   In the highland, where rebel violence has been heaviest,Thursday's vigil passed unheeded in Ayacucho, 225 miles southeast ofLima. But church bells rang and sirens wailed in Huancayo, 125 mileseast of Lima, witnesses said.   The protest against terrorism came as Peru faces a severeeconomic recession. Inflation is expected to hit 1,800 percent thisyear.   A recent report by the Senate's commission on violence said theeconomic woes and the insurgency and repressive countermeasures bygovernment forces were undermining Peru's democracy.   The commission said the roots of the insurgency are imbedded incenturies of hatred and discrimination between Peru's rich and poor.   Along with increasing reports of violence since October,newspapers daily carry stories on factory shutdowns, layoffs, adramatic fall in public spending power and growing lines for basicfoods.   ``Peru's general crisis brings us toward decisive years duringwhich our revolution will accelerate powerfully,'' the leader andfounder of the Shining Path, Abimael Guzman, said recently duringhis only published interview since the fighting began.   Guzman launched the insurgency to topple Peru's electedgovernment and install Marxist rule in May 1980.   Since then, the fighting has killed more than 12,000 people andhas spread throughout the central highlands, down to the majorcoastal cities and into the eastern jungle.   Among those slain this year were one American and two Frenchagricultural development workers, the first foreigners known to havebeen executed purposely by the guerrillas.   To counter the guerrillas, the government has installed states ofemergency, giving the military broad policing and governing powersin eight states where more than half of Peru's 21 million peoplelive.   Both the London-based Amnesty International and the NewYork-based Americas Watch sharply criticized Peruvian authorities inreports this year for tolerating human rights violations.</TEXT></DOC>
