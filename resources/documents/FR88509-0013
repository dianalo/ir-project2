Background and Summary  </ITAG>On November 25, 1986, the Commission adopted new shareholder communicationsrules and related amendments\9\<NOTE/> to effect the Shareholder Communications Act of 1985.\1\\0\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\Release No. 34-23847 (November 25, 1986) (51 FR 44267). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\Pub. L. No. 99-222, 99 Stat. 1737 (1985), amending 15U.S.C. 78n(b) (1982).   The new rules set forth the obligations of banks, associations and otherentities that exercise fiduciary powers (``banks'') in connection withforwarding proxy material\1\\1\<NOTE/> to beneficial owners and facilitating registrants' communicationswith beneficial owners of securities registered in the banks' names. Atthe time it adopted the new rules, the Commission deferred, until July1, 1987, the effectiveness of paragraphs (a) through (c) of Rule 14b-2,\1\\2\<NOTE/> which set forth the proxy processing obligations of banksand the omnibus proxy system, to give banks sufficient time to establishworkable procedures for the implementation of the proxy processing system.Banks' obligations with respect to the direct communications systems, however,became effective on December 28, 1986.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\The phrase ``proxy material'' is used in this releaseto refer collectively to proxy cards or requests for voting instructions,proxy soliciting material and annual reports to security holders.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\17 CFR 240.14b-2 (a) through (c).  While the new bank rules, as adopted, covered employee benefit plan participants,the Commission indicated that it would consider, in a separate rulemakingproceeding, the application of the shareholder communications rules toemployee benefit plans with securities held in nominee name by either brokersand dealers (``brokers'') or banks. On March 27, 1987, the Commission issueda release proposing rules to exclude, under specified circumstances, employeebenefit plan participants from the proxy processing and direct communicationsprovisions at the option of the registrant.\1\\3\<NOTE/> Specifically, under the March proposal, the registrant couldchoose to exclude plan particpants with securities held in nominee namepursuant to the plan from the proxy processing system established underthe shareholder communications rules, where the plan contained a mechanismfor timely dissemination of proxy material to plan participants and actionwas taken reasonably calculated to assure that plan participants receivedsuch materials in accordance with that mechanism. With regard to the directcommunications provisions, the proposal provided that a registrant couldchoose to exclude plan participants from a request for a list of beneficialowners, if the registrant had access, by some means other than the directcommunications provisions, to the names and addresses of the plan participants. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\Release No. 34-24274 (March 27, 1987) (52 FR 11083)(the ``March proposal'').  In addition, the release set forth a number of alternatives to the proposal.These alternatives included: (1) Making one or both of the exclusions mandatoryrather than optional; (2) basing automatic or optional exclusion from theshareholder communications rules on satisfaction of both prerequisites;(3) basing automatic or optional exclusion on satisfaction of only oneprerequisite; and (4) an automatic across-the-board mandatory exclusionof employee benefit plan participants from all aspects of the proxy processingand direct communications systems.   Twenty-one commentators responded to the Commission's request for commenton the March proposal.\14\<NOTE/> Sixteen of these commentators favored mandatory exclusionof plan participants from the proxy processing system either on an automaticacross-the-board basis or on satisfaction of the prerequisite that theplan have a system for obtaining and forwarding proxy material to planparticipants.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The comment letters are available for public inspectionand copying at the Commission's Public Reference Room (<T3>see</T3> File No. S7-11-87).Two commentators favored an exclusion at the option of the registrant.One commentator opposed, on recordkeeping grounds, any exclusion of planparticipants from the proxy processing system. Another commentator, theAmerican Bankers Association (``ABA''), suggested an additional approachto excluding plan participants. The ABA recommended an amendment to theproxy processing provisions that would make registrants solely responsiblefor ensuring that proxy material is distributed to participants who holdsecurities of the registrant in nominee name pursuant to an employee benefitplan that provides pass-through voting (the ``ABA approach''). Anothercommentator, the Department of Labor, stated that it had no objectionsto the ABA approach.To permit consideration of the ABA approach in addition to the March proposal,the Commission, on June 18, 1987, published for comment another proposalfor the treatment of plan participants under the proxy processing rulesthat reflected the ABA approach.\15\<NOTE/> Under the June proposal, beneficial owners who are employeebenefit plan participants would be excluded from the proxy processing provisionswith respect to securities of a registrant held in nominee name pursuantto the plan, if two prerequisites were satisfied. The first prerequisitewould require the registrant to have access to the names and addressesof such participants by some means other than the direct communicationsprovisions. The second prerequisite would require that the registrant notbe prohibited by the terms of the plan from communicating directly withsuch participants. The June proposal did not require that the plan itselfcontain a mechanism for furnishing proxy material to plan participants.Rather, it included a requirement that registrants cause proxy materialto be furnished to plan participants.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Release No. 34-24607 (June 18, 1987) (52 FR 23855) (the``June proposal''). Pending further consideration of the manner in whichemployee benefit plan participants would be treated under the shareholdercommunications rules, the Commission temporarily deferred imposing on banksan obligation under the shareholder communications rules to distributeproxy material to employee benefit plan participants. Corollary amendmentsto Rules 14a-13 and 14c-7 temporarily relieved registrants of their correspondingobligations under the shareholder communications rules with respect tosuch beneficial owners. Release No. 34-24606 (June 18, 1987) (52 FR 23643).The deferral did not apply to employee benefit plans with securities heldin nominee name by brokers.With respect to the direct communications provisions, registrants' requestsfor lists of beneficial owners would not cover employee benefit plan participantswith securities of that registrant held in nominee name pursuant to theplan. Just as for the proxy processing provisions, the exclusion wouldbe conditioned on registrant access to participant names and addresses,by some means other than the direct communications provisions.Under the June proposal, registrants would have been required to notifybrokers and banks of those plans satisfying the necessary prerequisites.Once such notice was received, a broker or bank would not include planparticipants when fulfilling its obligations under either the proxy processingor direct communications systems.Sixteen commentators addressed the June proposal.\16\<NOTE/> Of the 15 commentators that addressed this issue, 12 supporteda mandatory exclusion of plan participants from the shareholder communicationsrules, while two commentators opined that the exclusion should be optional.The Department of Labor stated that it had no objection to adoption ofthe proposed amendments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ The comment letters are available for public inspectionand copying at the Commission's Public Reference Room (<T3>see</T3> File No. S7-23-87).Exclusion of employee benefit plan securities from the shareholder communicationsrules will result in cost savings to registrants and lessen the administrativeburden on brokers and banks. Absent the exclusion, registrants would berequired to reimburse brokers and banks for expenses incurred in connectionwith complying with their obligations with respect to such beneficial ownersunder the proxy processing and direct communications systems. This wouldbe true even if the registrant has an established system for communicatingwith such plan participant beneficial owners. In addition, brokers andbanks would be required to maintain records regarding plan participants'names, addresses and securities positions, if such participants were coveredby the shareholder communications rules.At the same time, when coupled with a requirement that registrants causeproxy materials to be furnished to these plan participants, the exclusionpresents little danger that plan participants will be disenfranchised.Accordingly, as proposed in June, the Commission is adopting a mandatoryexclusion from the shareholder communications rules. In contrast, securitiesof companies unaffiliated with the plan sponsor that are held in an employeebenefit plan will continue to be subject to the shareholder communicationsrules.The amendments adopted today differ from the June proposal in a numberof respects. First, the exclusion is effected through a definition of ``exemptemployee benefit plan securities,'' while the June proposal structuredthe exclusion through prerequisites. Second, the notice requirement hasbeen eliminated for plans established by the registrant (``registrant-sponsoredplans''). A notice requirement has been retained, however, with regardto plans established by an affiliate of the registrant and holding securitiesof the registrant (``affiliate-sponsored plans''). Third, while the exclusionfrom the shareholder communications rules for securities held by registrant-sponsoredplans is mandatory, the exclusion for those held by affiliate-sponsoredplans is optional.The Commission also is amending the definition of employee benefit planapplicable to the shareholder communications rules. As proposed in June,the amendment would expand the term to cover plans primarily for employees,but that also include other persons.Finally, other technical and clarifying amendments, necessitated by theamendments adopted today, have been made.\17\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ All proxy rule amendments discussed below also have beenmade, where appropriate, to Rules 14c-1 and 14c-7, which govern informationstatements.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion </ITAG>Under the proxy processing exclusion adopted today, registrants generallywill be responsible for providing proxy material to employee benefit planparticipants. Brokers and banks generally will have no obligation withregard to either responding to registrants' requests for the number ofsets of proxy material needed for forwarding to beneficial owners or forwardingsuch material to these plan participants. Brokers' and banks' sole obligationwill be to sign the proxy card on behalf of the voting plan participant.Getting instructions to brokers and banks on the timing and method of signingthe proxy card will be the responsibility of the registrant.The proxy processing exclusion is only an exclusion in the sense that beneficialowner plan participants generally will not receive proxy material in accordancewith the shareholder communications procedures. These plan participants,however, will receive such material directly from the registrant, and ina timely manner. In contrast, the exclusion from the direct communicationsrules is a total exclusion. No alternate procedure for obtaining the names,addresses and securities positions of plan participants is mandated underthese rules. Registrants should note, however, that they may be requiredunder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (``ERISA'') \18\<NOTE/> to forward directly to plan participants the same shareholdercommunications they forward to beneficial owners through the direct communicationssystem.\19\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ 29 U.S.C. 1001,<T3> et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>See</T3> n. 23<T3> infra.</T3>A. Proxy Processing Provisions<ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Exclusion</ITAG>The amendments exclude from operation of the proxy processing provisionssecurities of the registrant held by an employee benefit plan establishedor sponsored by either the same registrant or an affiliate \20\<NOTE/> of the registrant.\21\<NOTE/> Securities of a registrant held by a plan sponsored by thesame registrant are automatically excluded, while securities held by aplan sponsored by an affiliate of the registrant are excluded only at theoption of the registrant.\22\<NOTE/> The registrant is required to furnish proxy material to planparticipants excluded (either automatically or at the election of the registrant)from the proxy processing provisions.\23\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ The term ``affiliate'' should be interpreted as definedin Rule 12b-2 (17 CFR 240.12b-2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ The term ``registrant'' means the issuer of the securitiesin respect of which proxies are to be solicited.<T3> See</T3> Rule 14a-1(j) (17 CFR 240.14a-1(j)).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ <T3>See</T3> Section II.A.1.b.<T3> infra</T3> for discussion of the optional exclusion for affiliate-sponsoredplans.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Compliance with the provisions of this requirement doesnot necessarily establish compliance with the fiduciary responsibilityprovisions of ERISA. Under section 404(a)(1)(D) of ERISA (29 U.S.C. 1104(a)(1)(D)),fiduciaries of employee benefit plans generally are required to dischargetheir duties in accordance with the documents and instruments governingthe plan insofar as they are consistent with requirements of ERISA. Inthis respect, under sections 403 and 404(a) of ERISA (29 U.S.C. 1103 and1104(a)), every plan fiduciary must discharge his duties for the exclusivebenefit, and solely in the interest, of plan participants and beneficiaries.A fiduciary must adhere strictly to these standards in implementing anyplan provisions relating to proxy materials. The Department of Labor hasindicated that, in the case of a plan which permits participants to directplan responses to tender offers, plan trustees would be relieved of liabilityfor losses resulting from participant decisions only if, among other things,they assure that participants are provided information necessary to makeindependent decisions.<T3> See</T3> letter to John Welch dated April 30, 1984, reprinted in BNAPens. Rptr., vol. 11, no. 19, at 633 (May 7, 1984). The Department of Laborviews the duties of plan fiduciaries under ERISA with respect to pass-throughvoting of securities similar to those with respect to pass-through of tenderoffers as articulated in the Welch letter. Thus, in discharging their dutiesunder ERISA, plan trustees may be obliged to take steps to disseminatematerials to participants in addition to the materials required to be distributedunder the plan.<T3>a. Mandatory_Registrant-Sponsored Employee Benefit Plans.</T3> Withregard to the mandatory exclusion, the amendments add a proviso to paragraph(a)(2) of Rule 14a-13 specifying that a registrant's Rule 14a-13(a)(1)\2\\4\<NOTE/> and (a)(2)\2\\5\<NOTE/> search card inquiry shall not cover beneficial owners\2\\6\<NOTE/> of exempt employee benefit plan securities. The term ``exemptemployee benefit plan securities'' is defined in new paragraph (d) to Rule14a-1\2\\7\<NOTE/> to include securities of the registrant held by an employeebenefit plan\2\\8\<NOTE/> established by the same registrant (as well as specifiedsecurities held by an affiliate-sponsored plan, which are exempt at theoption of the registrant, as discussed below).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ 17 CFR 240.14a-13(a)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ 17 CFR 240.14a-13(a)(2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ If voting authority rests with the plan trustee, thetrustee is the beneficial owner for purposes of the shareholder communicationsrules. <T3>See</T3> Rule 14b-2(i) (17 CFR 240.14b-2(i)).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ 17 CFR 240.14a-1(d).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ <T3>See</T3> Section II.C.1 <T3>infra</T3> for discussion of the revised definition of ``employee benefitplan.''All other proxy processing obligations of the registrant are derived fromthe Rule 14a-13(a) search card inquiry. Accordingly, no other revisionsare required to exclude employee benefit plan securities from the proxyprocessing procedures. Corollary amendments have been made to Rules 14b-1(d)(1)\2\\9\<NOTE/> and 14b-2(g)(1),\3\\0\<NOTE/> making it clear that brokers and banks have no obligationunder the proxy processing provisions to respond to registrants' Rule 14a-13(a)search card inquiries with respect to beneficial owners of exempt employeebenefit plan securities or to forward proxy material to such security holders.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ 17 CFR 240.14b-1(d)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ 17 CFR 240.14b-2(g)(1).The exclusion from the proxy processing provisions does not excuse a bankfrom executing an omnibus proxy under Rule 14b-2(b)\3\\1\<NOTE/> in favor of respondent banks with respect to exempt employeebenefit plan securities. Although proxy material will not be distributedto beneficial owners of exempt employee benefit plan securities under Commissionshareholder communications procedures and, instead, will be distributeddirectly by the registrant, the omnibus proxy procedure still will be requiredto ensure that legal voting authority reaches the bank with which plansecurities have been deposited. Alternatively, banks may comply with theterms of any Commission-approved alternate procedure to the omnibus proxyunder Rule 14b-2 (d).\3\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ 17 CFR 240.14b-2(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ 17 CFR 240.14b-2(d).New paragraph (d) to Rule 14a-13\3\\3\<NOTE/> requires that a registrant cause proxy material to be furnished,in a timely manner, to beneficial owners of exempt employee benefit plan.\3\\4\<NOTE/> Under this provision, a registrant may adopt in-house proceduresto perform its obligations under paragraph (d) of Rule 14a-13 or designatean agent, such as the plan administrator or trustee, to perform the service.\3\\5\<NOTE/> These amendments are intended to ensure that employee benefitplan participants, like other beneficial owners, receive proxy materialin a timely fashion.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ 17 CFR 240.14a-13(d).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ A new Note 3 to Rule 14a-13(a) directs registrants'attention to their obligations under paragraph (d) of Rule 14a-13. In addition,Note 2 to Rule 14a-13(a) has been amended to add a reference to the newlyadopted exclusion.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ A registrant that chooses to carry out these obligationsthrough an agent may be liable for the acts or omissions of its agent.Because banks often do not perform recordkeeping functions for employeebenefit plans, they may not have access to the names and addresses of planparticipants. Thus, these amendments eliminate the need to require, banksto obtain that information and maintain records regarding plan participantsthat duplicate those of the registrant. Once a determination has been madethat securities held by a registrant-sponsored plan are exempt from theshareholder communications rules, a bank, to the extent it maintains suchinformation, would be free to delete plan participant information, insofaras it relates to the exempt securities, from its beneficial owner records.To permit brokers to delete information from their records regarding whetheror not beneficial owners of exempt employee benefit plan securities objectedto disclosure of their names, addresses and securities positions to registrants,\36\<NOTE/> Rule 17a-3(a)(9)(ii) \37\<NOTE/> has been amended to eliminate the requirement that brokersmaintain this information as part of their recordkeeping obligations.\38\<NOTE/> This recordkeeping obligation was added as part of the shareholdercommunications rules.\39\<NOTE/> By deleting this requirement as it applies to exempt employeebenefit plan securities held by registrant-sponsored plans, the Commissionis leaving unchanged what is required under the general broker recordkeepingrules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ Brokers are required to collect this information pursuantto their obligations under the direct communications provisions. <T3>See</T3> Rule 14b-1(c) (17 CFR 240.14b-1(c)).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ 17 CFR 240.17a-3(a)(9)(ii).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ In both the March and June proposals comment was solicitedon whether Rule 17a-3(a)(9) should be amended to permit brokers to deletesuch information. Data on the costs associated with brokers continuingto request beneficial owner information from plan participants and maintainthis information also was requested. No comments on this issue were received.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ Release No. 34-20021 (July 28, 1983) (48 FR 35082).<T3>b. Optional_Affiliate-Sponsored Employee Benefit Plans.</T3> The Juneproposal generally would have required registrants to exclude employeebenefit plan holdings of their securities if the plan was sponsored byan affiliate of the registrant. The exclusion would have been accomplishedthrough the prerequisite that the registrant have access to plan participants'names and addresses, which presumably would be the case with regard tomost affiliate-sponsored plans. However, because such access cannot bepresumed for all affiliate-sponsored plans, the amendments provide foran exclusion at the option of the registrant that will permit registrantsto exclude from the proxy processing provisions their securities held bysuch plans.If a registrant has access to the names and addresses of participants inan affiliate-sponsored plan, the amendments would permit the registrantto realize the cost savings associated with the exclusion. If, however,the registrant does not have access to the names and addresses of theseplan participants, the registrant will be unable to comply with its obligationunder the exclusion to forward proxy materials to plan participants and,instead, will comply with its obligations under the proxy processing provisionsof the shareholder communications rules.Specifically, the amendments provide that the term ``exempt employee benefitplan securities'' includes securities of the registrant held by an employeebenefit plan where such plan is established by an affiliate of the registrantand notice regarding the current solicitation has been given pursuant toRule 240.14a-13(a)(1)(ii)(C).\40\<NOTE/> Once all requirements of the definition are satisfied, registrantswould be required under Rule 14a-13(d) to cause proxy material to be furnished,in a timely manner, to beneficial owners of these exempt employee benefitplan securities. The corollary amendments made to Rules 14b-1(d)(1) and14b-2(g)(1) provide that brokers and banks have no obligation under theproxy processing provisions to respond to registrants' Rule 14a-13 (a)(1)and (a)(2) search card inquiries with respect to beneficial owners of theseexempt employee benefit plan securities or to forward proxy material tosuch security holders.\41\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ 17 CFR 240.14a-13(a)(1)(ii)(C).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ As with the mandatory exclusion, the optional exclusionfrom the proxy processing provisions would not excuse a bank from executingan omnibus proxy under Rule 14b-2(g) in favor of respondent banks withrespect to these exempt employee benefit plan securities. <T3>See</T3> discussion <T3>supra</T3> Section II.A.1.a.The June proposal provided that brokers and banks would have been awareof excluded affiliate-sponsored plans through the notice requirement. Inthe absence of a notice provision, brokers and banks might have difficultyascertaining which employee benefit plan securities are subject to theexclusion. Thus, the definition of exempt employee benefit plan securitiesprovides for a notification procedure that will inform brokers and banksby means of the search card that securities of the registrant held by anaffiliate-sponsored plan are not to be included in responding to registrants'Rule 14a-13 (a)(1) and (a)(2) search cards. New paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(C)of Rule 14a-13 provides that registrants, at their option, may give noticeof any affiliate-sponsored plan of the registrant holding securities ofthe registrant that the registrant elects to treat as exempt employee benefitplan securities. Once such notice is received, a broker or bank will knownot to include such beneficial owners in its response to that search cardor to forward the forthcoming proxy material to such security holders.Because the relationship between a registrant and its affiliates may change,the rules have been structured so the notice does not trigger a permanentexclusion from the Commission's proxy processing procedures. Rather, theexclusion only applies to the particular solicitation with respect to whichthe registrant provided notice through its search card. Accordingly, thedefinition of exempt employee benefit plan securities refers to noticeregarding the current solicitation.Since the exclusion is optional with respect to securities held by an affiliate-sponsoredplan and notice is to be given for every proxy solicitation, the amendmentsto Rule 17a-3(a)(9)(ii) \4\\2\<NOTE/> do not permit brokers to exclude from their records beneficialowner information regarding whether such beneficial owners objected todisclosure of their name, address and securities position to registrants.Similarly, because the exclusion is an optional one with regard to affiliate-sponsoredplans and information regarding participants in such plans can be requestedat any time, banks should not delete affiliate plan participant informationfrom their beneficial owner records.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\<T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>supra </T3>Section II.A.1.a.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Proposed Access Prerequisite  </ITAG>The June proposal conditioned mandatory exclusion on the registrant havingaccess to the names and addresses of beneficial owners who are employeebenefit plan participants, by some means other than the direct communicationsprovisions of paragraph (b) of Rule 14a-13.\4\\3\<NOTE/> This access prerequisite was intended to ensure that registrantscould obtain the information necessary to forward proxy material to suchplan participants in accordance with the obligation proposed to be placedon registrants. For example, registrants could obtain information as tonames, addresses and securities positions of plan participants throughpayroll deductions or a list of plan participants provided by the planadministrator. Commentators generally opposed the access prerequisite asintroducing unnecessary lack of definitiveness, stating that plan sponsorregistrants always will have access to the names and addresses of planparticipants. As proposed, the access requirement also compelled a noticerequirement commentators viewed as burdensome.\4\\4\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\17 CFR 240.14a-13(b).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\<T3>See </T3>discussion at Section II.A.5. <T3>infra </T3>regarding the proposed notice requirement.  The proposed access prerequisite also was designed to limit the exclusionto participants in employee benefit plans only with respect to their holdingsof securities issued by a registrant that is the plan sponsor or an affiliateof the sponsor. Ordinarily, a registrant would not have access to the namesand addresses of beneficial owners who are participants in employee benefitplans that it does not sponsor.\4\\5\<NOTE/> Under the June proposal, the exclusion would not have beenapplicable to such securities. Rather, the proxy material would have beenfurnished to plan participants pursuant to the shareholder communicationsrules.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\For example, some plans permit the participants to designateinvestments in securities other than those issued by the sponsoring registrant. The rules, as adopted, address commentators' concerns about the accessand notice prerequisites by mandating delivery of proxy material to planparticipants by the registrant. The mandated delivery requirement is basedon the premise that all registrants have or can obtain access to the namesand addresses of participants in plans sponsored by them. With respectto affiliate-sponsored plans, the Commission was unable to conclude thatall registrants would have access to the names and addresses of such planparticipants or that brokers and banks would know which plans are affiliate-sponsored.Therefore, the exclusion was made optional and a notice provision was necessaryto effect the exclusion. The registrant, of course, should not give noticeregarding affiliate-sponsored plans unless it has access to the informationneeded to enable it to comply with its obligation to deliver proxy materialto the plan participants holding its securities.  In contrast, the definition does not encompass securities held by plansestablished by parties other than the registrant or its affiliate. Withrespect to such securities, registrants are required to comply with theproxy processing procedures with respect to plan participant holdings oftheir securities. Banks and brokers, correspondingly, are required to carryout their proxy processing obligations with respect to such securities. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Obtaining Beneficial Owner Information for Plan Participant Holdings </ITAG>The Commission recognizes that brokers and banks that do not perform participantrecordkeeping duties may not necessarily have access to the informationnecessary to perform their proxy processing obligations regarding securitiesof the registrant held by either affiliate-sponsored plans (where the registranthas chosen not to trigger the exclusion) or plans sponsored by entitiesnot affiliated with the registrant. Where there is no exclusion from theproxy processing provisions, a broker or bank, in order to satisfy theregistrant's request for the number of sets of proxy material needed forforwarding to beneficial owners who are plan participants, would have torequest such information from the party performing the recordkeeping function(which may be the registrant itself in the case of a non-plan sponsor'srequest). If the broker or bank makes a good faith effort to obtain thatinformation from the recordkeeper and is denied access to that information,in the Commission's view, it need not take further steps to satisfy itsobligations under these rules.\4\\6\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\Non-plan sponsor registrants also would comply withthe direct communications procedures under the shareholder communicationsrules, while registrants may wish to comply with such procedures regardingaffiliate-sponsored plan holdings of its securities, <T3>see </T3>discussion <T3>infra </T3>at Section II.B. Broker or bank difficulties, in such cases,in gaining access to the necessary information also would be subject toa good faith effort standard.   <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Proposed Prerequisite That Registrants Not Be Prohibited From CommunicatingWith Plan Participants</ITAG>The June proposal also contained an additional requirement for mandatoryexclusion of plan participants from the proxy processing provisions_thata registrant not be prohibited by the terms of the employee benefit planfrom communicating directly with beneficial owners who are employee benefitplan participants. This prerequisite was intended to recognize the possibilitythat a registrant could be unable to fulfill its obligation to cause proxymaterial to be furnished to plan participants. Under the proposal, distributionof proxy material, in such a situation, would have been accomplished inthe most effective manner through the proxy processing provisions of theshareholder communications rules.Several commentators addressed this prerequisite and stated that it wasunnecessary for the rules to distinguish between plans that meet the prerequisiteand plans that do not because, in effect, all plans do meet the prerequisite.Plans generally do not prohibit a registrant from communicating directlywith plan participants. Plan confidentiality provisions typically restrictmanagement from learning an employee's voting or tender instructions andfrom gaining access to account records where a tender offeror has purchasedany employer stock from the plan pursuant to a hostile tender offer. Thelatter type of confidentiality provision may, under limited circumstances,prevent the employer only from examining plan records to determine whetherany particular employee is still a ``beneficial owner'' of employer stockin the aftermath of a hostile tender offer. Further, even in the most unlikelyevent that a plan did contain such a prohibition on communicating directlywith participants, the registrant could use a third party such as the plantrustee for distributing proxy materials to plan participants.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Proposed Notice Requirement</ITAG>The June proposal would have required registrants to notify brokers andbanks of plans that met the prerequisites for exclusion from the proxyprocessing provisions. Under the proposed notice provision, the mandatorynotice generally would have been given to only one broker or bank_the entitythat directly held the registrant's securities in nominee name pursuantto an employee benefit plan. If the registrant failed to notify the appropriatebroker or bank, it would have been liable for any reasonable costs incurredby the broker or bank in performing its obligations under the proxy processingprovisions with regard to such excluded plan participants.In recognition of some of the difficulties involved in requiring a noticeprior to effectiveness of a mandatory exclusion, the Commission specificallystated in the June proposal that it was considering eliminating the noticerequirement because of the increased administrative burdens on banks andbrokers. With a notice requirement, banks and brokers would have to: (1)Determine which registrant/plan sponsors had provided notice and whichhad not; and (2) make provision in their recordkeeping systems for twocategories of plans. In addition, a notice requirement could have the resultof converting a mandatory exclusion to an optional one because brokersand banks would not be permitted to exclude securities that otherwise satisfiedthe requirements unless notice had been furnished by the registrant. Consistentwith those concerns and commentators' general opposition to a notice requirement,the Commission has deleted the notice requirement from the amendments applicableto the mandatory exclusion. As adopted today, the mandatory exclusion willput all banks and brokers on notice that specific securities held by employeebenefit plans are excluded from the proxy processing provisions of theshareholder communications rules.As discussed above, securities held in affiliate-sponsored plans may beexcluded at the option of the registrant. Notice must be given throughthe search card request in order to trigger the exclusion for such securitieswith respect to a particular proxy solicitation.B. Direct Communications Provisions<ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Exclusion</ITAG><T3>a. Mandatory_Registrant-Sponsored Employee Benefit Plans.</T3> Paragraph(b)(3) of Rule 14a-13 \4\\7\<NOTE/> is amended to provide that a registrant's request for a listof beneficial owners shall not cover beneficial owners of exempt employeebenefit plan securities.\4\\8\<NOTE/> Corollary amendments to Rules 14b-1 and 14b-2 provide thatbrokers and banks shall not include such information when responding toregistrants' requests for lists of beneficial owners.\4\\9\<NOTE/> This provision is intended to permit registrants to realizecost savings in connection with requesting beneficial owner lists while,at the same time, not requiring brokers and banks that generally do notperform plan recordkeeping duties to develop and maintain such records.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ 17 CFR 240.14a-13(b)(3).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\8\ <T3>See</T3> Section II.A.1 <T3>supra</T3> for discussion of the new definition of exempt employeebenefit plan securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\9\ Rules 14b-1(d)(2) and 14b-2(g)(2) (17 CFR 240.14b-1(d)(2)and 14b-2(g)(2)).<T3>b. Optional_Affiliate-Sponsored Employee Benefit Plans.</T3> The optionalexclusion regarding registrants' requests for beneficial owner informationconcerning beneficial owners of the registrants' securities held by anaffiliate-sponsored plan is structured in a similar fashion to the mandatoryexclusion from the direct communications provisions. The term ``exemptemployee benefit plan securities'' includes such securities if notice regardingthe current request for a list of names, addresses and securities positionsof beneficial owners has been given pursuant to Rule 14a-13(b)(3). Noticeis to be given at the time the registrant makes its request for a beneficialowner list. Like the notice provision for the proxy processing provisions,the notice is to be given each time a request for beneficial owner informationis made.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Proposed Access Prerequisite</ITAG>The June proposal provided for an access prerequisite similar to that proposedfor the proxy processing exclusion.\5\\0\<NOTE/> Commentators similarly viewed an explicit access prerequisiteas unnecessary because plan sponsor registrants always will have accessto plan participants' names and addresses. The Commission agrees. Insteadof an explicit prerequisite, the rules, as adopted, address the need foraccess through the definition of exempt employee benefit plan securities,as is done in the proxy processing system.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\0\ The March proposal contained a similar access prerequisitefor the direct communications exclusion. That exclusion was to be optionalon the part of the registrant. The exclusion adopted today, however, ismandatory, except with respect to affiliate-sponsored plans.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Proposed Notice Requirement</ITAG>The June proposal provided for a notice requirement for the direct communicationssystem like that proposed for the proxy processing exclusion. For the samereasons the Commission deleted the notice requirement for the proxy processingprovisions, the Commission has deleted the notice requirement for the directcommunications system, except with respect to the optional exclusion foraffiliate-sponsored plans.C. Other Revisions<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Amendment to the Definition of Employee Benefit Plan</ITAG>As proposed in June, amendments to paragraph (b) to Rule 14a-1 \5\\1\<NOTE/> and paragraph (b) to Rule 14c-1 \5\\2\<NOTE/> substitute the term ``primarily'' for the term ``solely''in the definition of employee benefit plan. These definitions previouslyincluded only plans solely for employees, directors, trustees or officers.\5\\3\<NOTE/> The amended definitions also encompass plans that are primarilyfor employees but also include other persons, such as consultants.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\ 17 CFR 240.14a-1(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\2\ 17 CFR 240.14c-1(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\3\ The amended definitions apply only to the shareholdercommunications rules and do not modify, in any way, the definitions includedin Rules 405 (17 CFR 230.405) and 701 (17 CFR 230.701) under the SecuritiesAct of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 771a, <T3>et seq.</T3>), and Rule 16b-3 (17 CFR 240.16b-3) under the ExchangeAct.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Dividend or Interest Reinvestment Plans</ITAG>In the June proposal, the Commission requested comment on whether the proposedexclusions from the proxy processing and direct communications provisionsshould be expanded further to include dividend or interest reinvestmentplans. Such plans often allow holders of securities to have their dividendsor interest automatically reinvested by the dividend or interest payingagent in additional securities in lieu of cash distribution. Securitiespurchased under the plan generally are held in nominee name. One commentatoron the March proposal stated that a common requirement for such plans isthat a participant must hold at least one share of the registrant's stockin his own name. According to this commentator, this requirement assuresthat the name and address of the participant is known to the registrant,despite the fact that the participant's ownership of the registrant's securitiesis in nominee name. Accordingly, the Commission solicited comment in connectionwith the June proposal on whether, in fact, this is a common feature ofsuch plans.Commentators were divided on whether this was a common feature of dividendor interest reinvestment plans. Two commentators noted that, although theplan may require the participant to be a record holder of at least oneshare of the registrant's stock at the time of enrolling in the plan, someplans do not require the record holder to maintain any shares directlyin its name after joining the plan.Due to the division among commentators regarding common features of theseplans and the Commission's desire not to make it more difficult for securityholders to exercise their right to vote, the Commission has determinedthat, at this time, it will not exclude securities held pursuant to a dividendor interest reinvestment plan from the shareholder communications rules.Participants in such plans will continue to receive proxy material andother corporate communications through established shareholder communicationssystems.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Cost-Benefit Analysis</ITAG>The Commission requested commentators to provide views and data as to thecosts and benefits associated with the proposed amendments. In the Junerelease, the Commission noted that the proposal would obligate the registrantto furnish proxy material to beneficial owners whose securities are heldin nominee name pursuant to an employee benefit plan, but eliminate boththe requirement that record holders and respondent banks distribute proxymaterial to such plan participants, and the need for record holders andrespondent banks to obtain and maintain beneficial owner information regardingsuch plan participants. In addition, the Commission noted that the proposalswould permit further cost savings to registrants in obtaining beneficialowner lists, the charges for which are calculated on a per name basis.The Commission also noted that additional costs would be incurred in connectionwith the notice requirement. The notice requirement has been deleted fromthe amendments as adopted, except for notice with respect to the optionalexclusion for affiliate-sponsored plans.Commentators generally expressed the view that the proposed amendmentswould decrease costs of complying with the shareholder communications rulesfor both brokers and banks and registrants.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
