I was the attorney who argued for similar relief before the U.S. Supreme Court in the landmark securities-fraud case, McMahon v. Shearson, where I urged the Supreme Court to permit investors to retain the right to choose either a judicial or arbitral forum to resolve claims of brokerage fraud. In the wake of the narrow five-to-four Supreme Court decision that would under normal circumstances require the enforceability of predispute arbitration agreements, Massachusetts correctly notes that investors do not negotiate this item with the brokerage firm, but typically sign a printed form with the arbitration clause in print so fine that it would cause normal eyes to become myopic.    The securities industry has been reported to have sued the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on grounds that the rule is unconstitutional. I believe states do have the right to both license brokerage firms and make rules pertaining to fair trade practices. Each of the 50 states has a securities division that is set up by statute in order to regulate the securities industry on the state level. The North American Securities Administrators Association is a highly regarded organization, composed of state securities commissioners, which has during the past year strongly come out in favor of consumer legislation such as the one the securities industry is attacking.    Congress also has not sat on its hands with this issue. The House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance proposed a bill that would not only retroactively prohibit mandatory arbitration clauses but would also require that the securities arbitrations procedures, currently in place at the self-regulatory organizations, be reformed in an attempt to take away the home-field advantage now enjoyed by the securities industry.
