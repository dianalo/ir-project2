 Major changes arelooming in systems, applications and, most important, personnel skills.andM;This transition will be complicated by the fact that products based onofficial standards historically have been a step or two behind the state ofthe art.andP;  Inevitably, politics will inhibit the swift development andacceptance of official standards around the world.andM;Despite these obstacles, products are available that can ease the comingtransition as well as improve operations in the meantime.andM;Perhaps the best example is the de facto UNIX operating-system standard onwhich the formal standard Posix is based.andP;  UNIX provides the sourcetechnology for an open systems environment.andP;  It is widely accepted as amultiuser, multitasking system that lets users port applications acrossmicros, minicomputers and mainframes.andM;Yet UNIX carries inherent transition problems that will affect everypotential user.andP;  How can the shake-up of day-to-day operations be reduced asthe new operating system is brought in and staff is trained?andM;The solution may be a virtual-machine environment in which both non-UNIX andUNIX applications run concurrently.andP;  Virtual-machine computing should not beconfused with simple emulations or &quot;metaport&quot; implementations where UNIX islayered atop a proprietary operating system.andM;Although the two operating systems in a layered situation may live in thesame house, so to speak, system performance suffers.andP;  As in an up-and-downduplex, second-floor residents have slower and more difficult access thanfirst-floor residents.andM;Layering also affects applications portability because a metaport relies onproprietary operating services that may not correspond functionally with UNIXservices.andP;  Metaports can provide both worlds, but not the best of bothworlds.andM;On the other hand, a true virtual-machine capability allows multipleoperating systems to share the same computer's main memory, CPU and I/Odevices, much as a conventional operating system lets multiple users sharethe resources of a single operating system.andM;In this side-by-side duplex, virtual-machine connections are defined aslogical, not physical.andP;  Each operating system functions as if it were in anative environment with sole control of the physical machine.andM;A virtual-machine environment can be especially helpful in migrating from anexisting operating system to UNIX.andM;By partitioning a single physical machine into multiple virtual machines, theADP manager can test the new operating system and train staff to use it on adevelopmental virtual machine, while continuing to run the old operatingsystem on a production virtual machine.andM;This arrangement gives users time to migrate gradually rather than changingall at once to a new operating system, new applications and a new userinterface.andM;Workstations and disks can be shared among virtual machines, so the cost ofimplementation is negligible compared with buying a replacement computer.andM;Such a system also can be set up for task independence and security byprohibiting one virtual machine from accessing the memory and resourcesallocated to other virtual machines.andM;One virtual machine can be halted and restarted while other virtual machineprograms can continue to run uninterrupted.andM;Virtual-machine products are available now for micros, minis and mainframes.andO;In the micro market, Phoenix Technologies, Norwood, Mass.; InteractiveSystems Corp., Santa Monica, Calif.; and the Santa Cruz Operation, SantaCruz, Calif., market VP/ix, which allows MS-DOS to operate as a task underunix or Xenix.andP;  With VP/ix, a single-user PC also gains the ability to runmultiuser applications.andM;IBM Corp. mainframes and compatibles have had virtual machine capabilitiesfor years.andP;  VM/370 is installed on a third of all IBM mainframes, and thePR/SM package recently was announced for the 3090.andM;Amdahl Corp.'s multiple domain feature allows the creation of multiplevirtual machines.andP;  Among minicomputers, Wang Laboratories Inc. has VS/VM,which allows VS IN/ix, a UNIX System V-complaint operating system, to runconcurrently with as many as 15 VS operating system virtual machines.andP;  IBM'sVM/370 product also runs on its midrange 9370 computers.andM;However intoxicating the benefits of open systems, users should be preparedto travel a bumpy road in the wilderness to reach them.andP;  Virtual-machinecomputing can help cushion the ride and preserve investments.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
