Adler (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> TNM </IN><TEXT>   The law firms Hopkins andamp; Sutter and Hamel andamp; Park agreed to join forces, forming a firm that will have 238 lawyers.    The firms project combined revenue of $55 million for 1988, according to Michael Phenner, managing partner of Hopkins andamp; Sutter, based in Chicago. The new firm will have 162 lawyers in Chicago, 60 in Washington, where Hamel andamp; Park is based, and 16 in a Dallas branch.    Hopkins andamp; Sutter's partnership yesterday voted unanimously to approve the merger, effective July 1. Partners in the smaller Hamel andamp; Park consented in a May 20 vote.    The Chicago and Dallas offices will operate under the name of Hopkins andamp; Sutter, while the Washington office will be called Hopkins, Sutter, Hamel andamp; Park.    The merger comes in the wake of the disintegration of Isham, Lincoln andamp; Beale, once a prominent Chicago firm that merged with the smaller, feistier Reuben andamp; Proctor in 1986. Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson andamp; Casey, now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings, also was built through a series of mergers. And in late 1986, two prominent Dallas firms unhitched after an unhappy five-month marriage.    Mr. Phenner took pains to distinguish this merger from those unsuccessful efforts. &quot;Isham was a mix of totally different cultures. This is not that at all. Hopkins andamp; Sutter and Hamel andamp; Park are very, very similar in many respects,&quot; he said.    John Pettit, managing partner of Hamel andamp; Park, said the two firms first discussed a merger five years ago and have had on-and-off talks since then. Lawyers at the two firms have worked together frequently, particularly in representing insurance company associations in tax matters, Mr. Pettit said.    For Hamel andamp; Park, which has 48 lawyers, the merger provides the resources of a much larger firm and allows it to expand its practices in tax, banking, and corporate securities. For its part, Hopkins andamp; Sutter gains a major Washington presence that will be particularly helpful to its banking practice. &quot;All clients in banking have legislative and regulatory concerns and issues,&quot; Mr. Phenner said.    Based on projected revenue of $55 million, the merged firm expects to generate profits of about $266,000 per equity partner in the current calendar year, Mr. Phenner said.    Law firm mergers tend to run aground on such issues as corporate culture, partner compensation, and systems of management. The two firms retained management consultant Bradford Hildebrandt to analyze the compatibility of the firms and smooth the transition. &quot;Those of us in the business knew the Isham thing should never have been put together,&quot; Mr. Hildebrandt said. &quot;We did our due diligence here and it's a perfect combination.&quot;    Mr. Phenner, who will become managing partner of the combined firm, said the two firms have similar partnership structures in which younger partners are paid salaries and only later become eligible for full equity participation. In addition, he said the two firms have similar levels of profitability, making it unlikely that any partner's compensation will be altered significantly.    In merging, the two firms will come full circle. The predecessor to Hamel andamp; Park was formed 59 years ago when Charles Hamel left Hopkins andamp; Sutter and started his own firm. </TEXT></DOC>
