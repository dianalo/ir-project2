The Pakistani official, Yaqoub Khan, met with President HafezAssad after a closed-door session with his Syrian counterpart,Farouk Sharaa, the official Syrian News Agency reported. It gave nodetails.   But diplomatic sources said Khan, who flew in earlier Saturdayfrom Tehran, briefed Sharaa on the results of his talks in Iran onthe hostage issue.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Sharaa toldKhan about efforts Syria had exerted on behalf of the hostages.Syria has 40,000 troops in Moslem regions of Lebanon under a 1976Arab League peacekeeping mandate.   Khan was expected to fly to Washington to discuss with PresidentBush the results of his efforts.   In Tehran, the English-language daily Tehran Times called onWashington Saturday to take practical steps, ``rather than talk onbettering ties with Iran.''   While Khan was in Tehran, Iran's new president, HashemiRafsanjani, was quoted by the official media as saying his countrywould work for the release of Western hostages if the United Statesadopts more a friendly stance toward the Islamic republic.   Rafsanjani also told Khan that the United States should pressureIsrael to release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, 33, who was abducted July28 from his home in south Lebanon by an Israeli commando unit.   Obeid is the local leader of Hezbollah in south Lebanon.Hezbollah, or Party of God, is Iran's proxy force in Lebanon. It isbelieved to be an umbrella for extremists holding the foreignhostages.   A group calling itself The Oppressed on Earth Organization hasclaimed that it hanged an U.S. Marine, Lt. Col William R. Higgins,in retaliation for Obeid's abduction. U.S. sources say Higgins mayhave been killed earlier.   Eight Americans are among the 16 hostages that remain incaptivity. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1983.</TEXT></DOC>
