Appears Ready To Move Up Presidential Primary Date</HEAD><BYLINE>By STEVE LAWRENCE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tired of being a wallflower inpresidential nomination politics, California appears ready to moveup its primary to make it one of the nation's earliest, a step thatcould jolt the selection process.   ``It would be probably one of the most significant changes in thetexture of the nominating process in the last several decades,''Mike McCurry, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee,said earlier this month.   ``It would probably confine the field of likely candidates tothose that are well financed and able to put together substantialstate organizing drives.''   Delegate-rich California, with more than 13 million registeredvoters and five major TV markets, requires several million dollarseven for a minimal statewide campaign effort.   Various proposals would schedule the state's presidential primaryon the third Tuesday in February, the first Tuesday in March or inApril.   If the February or March proposals had been in effect last year,California's primary would have come immediately after the Iowacaucuses and New Hampshire primary and would have overshadowed thoseraces, traditionally the kickoff points for presidential campaigns,one lawmaker said.   New Hampshire has a law mandating that it always be the firstprimary. Iowa caucuses, in which party activists pick committeddelegates, have in the last four elections preceded the NewHampshire primary by about two weeks.   ``If you're a candidate running for president do you want to betrudging around in the snow (in Iowa or New Hampshire) or do youwant to be in California?'' asks Assemblyman Mike Roos, co-author ofone early primary bill.   California holds one of the latest primary elections in thenation _ on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in June _ andits voters have not had a real impact in determining a presidentialnominee since 1972, even though the state sends the largest blocs ofdelegates to the Republican and Democratic conventions.   In recent years, the nominations of both major parties have beenlocked up or virtually locked up by June.   Critics grumble that the late primary has allowed candidates totap the state for campaign donations but ignore issues of particularconcern to Californians, such as offshore oil drilling, until afterthe conventions.   Putting California near the top of the schedule would reversethat situation and help the state's economy by increasing campaignspending here, supporters of a change say.   ``The result is that all of the candidates would spend a lot moretime in California actively campaigning,'' said Assembly MinorityLeader Ross Johnson, author of a February primary bill.   The Legislature has rejected several previous attempts to move upthe election date, but backers have been picking up influentialsupport.   Gov. George Deukmejian, once an opponent of early primarylegislation, endorsed the idea in January, and the Legislature's topleaders have all given the concept at least lukewarm support.   ``There is a growing realization across the board that Californiaought to play a greater role in the candidate selection process,''said Johnson. ``It does not make sense for New Hampshire and Iowa tohave the disproportionate influence they do.''</TEXT></DOC>
