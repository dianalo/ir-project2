But in the marketplace, monopolies are rare, and unregulated monopolies rarer yet.    So some investment professionals seek what they consider the next-best thing: companies with a dominant market share, say 75% or more. These companies, they say, can stiff-arm competition, maintain high profit margins, and set the rules of the game within their industries or market niches.    One partisan of the market-share approach to picking stocks is Eugene Martin, a portfolio manager for National Investment Services of America Inc. in Milwaukee. Two stocks he currently holds are Paychex Inc. and Agency Rent-A-Car.    Paychex, Mr. Martin says, &quot;has been and continues to be an unregulated monopoly&quot; in providing payroll checks and related services to companies with fewer than 100 employees. The service is similar to that offered larger companies by Automatic Data Processing. But Mr. Martin believes Paychex needn't worry about ADP's muscling in on its niche, because he says Paychex can serve the smaller customer at much lower cost.    Agency Rent-A-Car, Mr. Martin says, has a 30% annual earnings growth rate and a price-earnings ratio of 15. This fits the statistical profile he looks for -- a company where the growth rate is twice the P-E ratio. Despite heavy competition in the general car-rental business, Mr. Martin sees Agency as the only company so far that offers low-cost rental cars to people whose cars have been damaged in accidents. Agency markets the rentals mainly through insurance companies.    Chris Niemczewski, president of Justin Asset Management, also advocates market share as an important factor in stock picking. One of his past winners was Washington Post, whose flagship newspaper has a virtual monopoly in the nation's capital. After roughly tripling his money, he sold his shares in 1985, believing them overpriced.    &quot;I wish there were such easy investments around now,&quot; Mr. Niemczewski says. Four market-dominant concerns he likes, but considers too pricey, even after the October stock market crash, are Snap-On Tools, Deluxe Check Printers, Safety-Kleen and Dun andamp; Bradstreet.    Unable to find any concerns with near-monopoly status at prices he considers reasonable, Mr. Niemczewski is looking at oligopoly situations -- in which a given market is controlled by a small number of companies or suppliers -- in the advertising industry and investment banking. He believes a handful of companies will increasingly dominate both industries, and is toying with the idea of buying Ogilvy Group and Salomon.    For Andrew Lanyi, managing director of the Lanyi division of Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co., his ideal stock is a small, rapidly growing company with a dominant position in a recession-resistant niche. Over the years, Mr. Lanyi says, he has racked up profits of about 30-fold by getting in early on such stocks as Automatic Data Processing and Handamp;R Block. Today, three of his favorites are Actmedia, Insituform of North America and PCS.    Actmedia specializes in point-of-sale advertising, like signs on shopping carts and supermarket aisles. According to Mr. Lanyi, it has the top 20 consumer-goods manufacturers and the top 20 supermarket chains as clients, making it extremely difficult for competitors to break in. An upstart called Shelfvision tried last year, but Actmedia lowered its prices, defeated the challenge, and ultimately bought out Shelfvision. Mr. Lanyi believes Actmedia will raise its prices this spring; an Actmedia spokeswoman says she doesn't know about that.    Insituform of North America has a proprietary process for repairing damaged sewer lines. After its stock exploded to about 25 from 2 1/2 over an 18-month period, the stock fell back to 4 3/4 last year, partly because of management infighting. But Mr. Lanyi says &quot;business today is better than ever&quot; and calls the company &quot;probably the purest monopoly in the U.S. today.&quot;    PCS, partly spun off from McKesson Corp. in late 1986, provides employees of various companies with cards used to purchase drugs from pharmacies. The employer gets a single bill and reduced transaction costs, the pharmacist gets extra business, and the employee gets reimbursed for drug costs without having to fill out long insurance forms.    A look at 1987 shows clearly that picking high-market-share companies isn't a foolproof strategy. For example, Mr. Lanyi's three stocks averaged about a 9% loss last year. PCS rose 63%, but Insituform of North America declined 63% and Actmedia declined 28%. Meanwhile, the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2%. Similarly, Mr. Martin's picks didn't burn up the track: Paychex rose 6% but Agency dropped 5%.    One problem with picking high-market-share companies is that they often sell for a high multiple of earnings, lessening the chances for gain because high expectations are already built into the stock price.    Also, an apparent barrier to entry by competitors sometimes proves to be a fence with a hole in it. And Charles Haynes, a financial planner in Birmingham, Ala., frets that companies with a high market share may &quot;get fat and happy.&quot; Before long, once-royal profit margins may start to slip.    Still, Mr. Lanyi argues, picking market-dominant companies early in their growth cycle will pay off in the long run, on the belief that a few big winners will carry the whole portfolio. </TEXT></DOC>
