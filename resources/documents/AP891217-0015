These ``reversions,'' legal under a 1974 law, face growingcriticism amid warnings that parts of the nation's $2 trillionprivate pension system are on shaky ground and could eventuallyforce a massive taxpayer bailout.   Big business, backed by the Bush administration, argues that thepension raids only involve surplus money, most of it supplied bythe employer in the first place. Some unions and workers, however,say they are being robbed of money that is rightfully theirs.   Corporate raiders, taking hundreds of millions of dollars in asingle reversion, have attracted most of the attention. But bigbusiness isn't alone in taking advantage of the law.   Some 2,000 companies have applications pending with the InternalRevenue Service for pension reversions. Among them, according toIRS documents obtained by The Associated Press: The Museum ofModern Art in New York, which is seeking $17 million; the DetroitAthletic Club, seeking $842,000; Niagara University, $500,000; theSt. Louis Country Club, $736,000.   The 1974 Employment Retirement Income Security Act, known asERISA, allows employers to pull back the money by terminating thepension programs and paying off the employees, usually with a lumpsum.   Industry statistics show that 25 percent of the plans are notreplaced. In many other cases, the pensions are succeeded byprograms that provide fewer benefits. And even if a plan isrestored, it has been stripped of its cushion against potentialfuture losses from bad investments or stock crashes.   The Labor Department estimates that about 80 percent of privatepension plans contain some sort of surplus, making them potentialtargets.   Michael S. Gordon, a Washington pension attorney, likens themaneuver to ``breaking into a piggy bank.''   ``In order to get its mitts on what is usually a surplus, theemployer will terminate the plan. Not for any sound businessreason, but to help finance a takeover or ward off one,'' Gordonsaid.   ``That money should stay in the retiree system,'' said James B.Foley, a retired American Red Cross vice president whose formeremployer took an almost $100 million reversion this year.   The West German company, Tengelmann Group, recouped the money itused to buy Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co. by terminating the Aandamp;Ppension plan and netting more than $200 million. On the other side,Union Carbide helped thwart a takeover by GAF by pulling $500million from its pension plans.   Exxon Corp. drew a record $1.6 billion reversion in 1986.   The government's official tally shows that since 1980, about2,000 companies have terminated their employer-paid plans to nababout $26 billion. And those figures do not include the far morenumerous reversions of less than $1 million.   Ten reversions of more than $1 million were completed in May andJune of this year, the IRS documents show. At the same time, 298smaller ones were completed.   Jeffrey Mamorsky, a New York pension attorney and author, saysthe money is a well-deserved reward for companies, large or small,that have managed their pension programs well.   ``We don't live in a communist country,'' he said. ``There'snothing that's forcing employers to install the plan or keep theplan.''   Gordon, who helped write the ERISA law, disagrees. ``Theattitude of the (Bush) administration and business is totally atwar with the interests of the beneficiaries across the UnitedStates,'' he said.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum says he's been fighting for six years tomake it tougher for companies to skim off the excess money.   ``I don't think it should be legal,'' the Ohio Democrat said.``I'm not saying any of these people are being evil; I just saythey're being unfair.''   But Mark Ugoretz, executive director of the ERISA IndustryCommittee, argues that restrictive laws will cause employers todump their plans.   ``Ultimately you will see a complete reduction in planfunding,'' Ugoretz said. ``It would weaken the retirement securityof people in the plans. It would substantially jeopardize thestatus of the PBGC.''   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, is thefederal insurer for employer-paid plans. Already holding a deficitof $1.5 billion, the PBGC gets most of its revenues from premiumspaid by the companies.   James B. Lockhart, executive director of the PBGC, said most ofthe deficit stems from the beleaguered steel industry but notedthat pension funds of the major airlines are underfunded by about$2 billion. Should they collapse, the burden would fall on thefederal agency.   Papers obtained under the Freedom of Information Act showed thatDelta Air Lines and Pan American World Airways are among thecompanies that have been fined by the PBGC for making late premiumpayments. Both have underfunded plans.   The PBGC also filed a contingency claim against Eastern AirLines to cover an estimated pension plan underfunding of $1.1billion.   The pension agency faces another threat from the Dallas-basedLTV Corp. The company declared bankruptcy in 1986 and saddled thePBGC with claims of about $2.3 billion for more than 108,000employees.   LTV has since restructured and come out of bankruptcy, butcontends that the government should still have to pay its pensionobligations.   The case is before the Supreme Court, where a ruling in favor ofLTV could open the door to similar maneuvers by other companiesseeking to dump their pension obligations on taxpayers.   ``Like the federal savings and loan insurance program, thepension termination insurance program is in dire financialcondition,'' the Justice Department says in a legal brief backingthe PBGC's suit.</TEXT></DOC>
