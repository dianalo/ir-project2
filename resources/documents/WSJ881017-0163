Lublin (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MNRCY ANGLY DBRSY GLDFY NEM </CO><IN> PCS TNM CMD </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When the shouting is over, will South African interests dominate the world's supply of diamonds, gold, platinum and key strategic minerals?    That possibility is the central argument in Consolidated Gold Fields PLC's struggle to defeat a hostile takeover bid by Minorco S.A. Minorco, which has ties to a huge South African industrial empire, has offered #2.05 billion for the 70.6% of the big British mining company that it doesn't already own. Last week, it marginally increased its Consolidated holding to 29.5% from 29.4% with its first share purchases since launching the bid Sept. 21. (Amid speculation that it might raise the offer, Consolidated urged shareholders to reject the bid because it &quot;seriously undervalues&quot; Consolidated's assets.)    The winner of this bitter slugfest between the globe's gold giants will carry tremendous clout in the world's precious metals industry. If Consolidated's claim came true, South Africa's increased domination could harm U.S. defense interests and alter its balance of power with the West. South Africa might, for instance, withhold strategic minerals from countries in retaliation for sanctions imposed because of its apartheid policies.    But Consolidated's argument generally isn't believed. Under political pressure, Minorco already has agreed or likely will agree to sell those Consolidated interests that significantly would increase its holdings of precious metals and strategic minerals. And Consolidated so far has failed to attract broad support for its fight in the U.S., partly because of presidential campaign politics and partly because it too has South African connections.    &quot;It's really quite damaging to make all these claims&quot; about possibly wider South African domination when Consolidated can't substantiate them, argues Mark Wood, a mining-industry analyst at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities Ltd., a London brokerage. &quot;I can't see how a threat to U.S. interests exists at all.&quot;    Consolidated, founded 101 years ago by empire builder Cecil Rhodes, is battling Harry Oppenheimer, the head of one of South Africa's wealthiest families. Minorco, a Luxembourg-based company, recently moved from Bermuda. It is 60.1%-owned by Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the gold- and diamond-mining interests controlled by the Oppenheimers. Shares issued under the bid would reduce De Beers and Anglo American's total holding in Minorco to about 40.9%.    De Beers dominates the world's diamond production, a role unaltered by Minorco's offer. The picture also wouldn't change much for either gold or platinum if the Minorco bid succeeds and it carries out planned sales of several Consolidated stakes.    Minorco has said the merged company would dispose of Consolidated's 49.7% stake in Newmont Corp., the biggest U.S. gold mining company, and its 38% stake in Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd., a mining company. The unanswered gold question is what happens to Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd., an Australian mining concern in which Consolidated owns a 49% stake. Renison has a one-third interest in the potentially rich Porgera gold mining project in Papua New Guinea; last week, the government there said Renison would have to sell those holdings if South African interests acquired Consolidated.    With the expected sales, Minorco's effective control of Western gold supplies would increase only slightly, to 21% from the current 20%. Similarly, Minorco's sale of the Gold Fields of South Africa interest would dispose of Consolidated's sole platinum mining interest.    The picture is less clear for strategic minerals, but experts also raise doubts about whether Minorco's success would widen South African domination of two key minerals, titanium and zirconium. Consolidated claims Renison is the world's largest producer of mineral sands, feedstocks for these widely used metals. Titanium, largely used as a paint thickener, also is used in jet engines and the space shuttle. Zirconium, mainly used in foundries and chemical processing, also is a critical part in U.S. nuclear submarines, power plants and rocket nose cones.    But how critical are these feedstock supplies for the defense and nuclear industries? Very important, Consolidated says. It cited them in asking President Reagan to block the hostile takeover on grounds that it would endanger U.S. national security. Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke sides with Consolidated. Last week, he asked Britain and the U.S. to intervene in the bid.    But Minorco -- and many industry analysts -- disagree. In a letter Friday to Mr. Reagan, Minorco said the acquisition couldn't present a threat to national security. Only 5% of zircon sand production &quot;goes into anything that might be considered strategic,&quot; says a London analyst. He says the same is true for rutile, a titanium metal feedstock that Renison produces.    In addition, &quot;there is no shortage of feedstock,&quot; adds Kleinwort Grievson's Mr. Wood. Most titanium metal found in U.S. military planes and other defense equipment, for example, comes from plentiful sources of rutile in America. If international opposition were to build over the strategic minerals issue, Minorco &quot;would be quite happy to get rid of {Consolidated's stake in} Renison,&quot; observes Duncan Balmer, an analyst with London brokers Phillips andamp; Drew. In fact, he adds, all Minorco really wants through the bid is Gold Fields Mining Corp., a U.S. mining unit, and ARC, a building materials supplier.    Consolidated's U.S. image, tarnished by its South African holding, makes it even harder for the British company to defeat Minorco's bid there. Some U.S. pension funds have refused to buy Consolidated shares because of its South African stake. To oppose apartheid, about 33 states and 75 cities won't give work to companies owned by South Africans or with direct South African ties. Consolidated's ARC unit, the biggest producer in the U.S. of concrete pipe, has been able to keep winning state and local government contracts only by strenuously arguing that its South African holding is merely an investment.    If Consolidated &quot;had no links to South Africa and Minorco was trying to take it over, that would have aroused much more anger than is the case now,&quot; observes Mike Terry, executive secretary of the Anti-Apartheid Movement in London.    The U.S. presidential campaign muddies the picture even further. The last thing Republicans &quot;want to do is to highlight South African issues right before the election,&quot; says Mr. Wood, the analyst. A senior Reagan administration official agrees. &quot;I don't think at this point in the campaign that {the White House} is going to open up a Pandora's box&quot; such as investigating South Africa's threatened domination of strategic metals, the official says.    Consolidated officials aren't discouraged. They note that five U.S. Senators, including three Republicans, have urged President Reagan to block or at least investigate Minorco's bid. The company also has asked Britain, South Africa and Australia to stop the bid for anti-competitive or national interest reasons; a South African monopolies probe has begun.    &quot;We are fighting this war on many fronts,&quot; observes Gerry Grimstone, a director of J. Henry Schroder Wagg andamp; Co., Consolidated's London advisers. A single loss, say in the U.S., won't be &quot;fundamental to our overall campaign.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
