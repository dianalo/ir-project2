The ruling Tuesday grew out of a dispute between RichardRosenbaum and his mother, Jean, a retired teacher. The son, who isin his early 40s, filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction to stop herfrom calling him and his wife.   Judge Thomas J. O'Brien issued the injunction in 1985 butordered the son to telephone his mother at least once every threemonths and meet with her once a year.   The judge later dropped those requirements, but did order theson to keep his mother informed of where he lives. Mrs. Rosenbaumappealed the ruling.   State Appeals Court Justice Anthony Scariano sided with the son.   ``This is a sad and unfortunate situation,'' he said. ``However,it takes more than a mere secular tribunal to command filialdevotion.''</TEXT></DOC>
