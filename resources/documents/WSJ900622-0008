Indosuez Asia's parent company, Banque Indosuez of Paris,bought Gartmore's London parent, Gartmore InvestmentManagement Ltd., last March for $230 million from British andamp;Commonwealth Holdings PLC, a troubled Britishfinancial-services company. Gartmore had been up for salesince November 1989.</LP><TEXT>   Indosuez Asia officials said that Gartmore's Hong Kongoperation will be closed, and that its remaining employeeswill be given the option of staying on with Indosuez Asia.Gartmore funds that are administered in Europe will continueto carry the Gartmore name as part of Gartmore Indosuez AssetManagement Ltd., the newly created holding company for allGartmore-Indosuez fund-management activities world-wide.   The absorption of Gartmore's Asian-Pacific operations byIndosuez Asia marks the end of what once was one of theregion's highest-profile fund managers. Under the leadershipof managing director Duncan Mount, now a director at CEFInvestment Management (Bermuda) Ltd. in Hong Kong, severaltop-performing Gartmore funds attracted droves of investorsduring the bull market of the mid-1980s.   Then the equities crash of 1987 hit Gartmore's funds hard.Its Oriental Ventures Trust, a diversified Asian-Pacific fundthat was heavily publicized, lost more than half its value.Since then, Gartmore has taken a more conservative approachto managing funds, but the tarnish from the crash never woreoff, according to fund managers and brokers in Hong Kong.   Indosuez Asia, with more than $1 billion under management,will pick up about $150 million by absorbing Gartmore'sregional funds, said Robert Lloyd George, managing directorof Indosuez Asia in Hong Kong. World-wide, the mergedIndosuez-Gartmore operations will have about $25 billionunder management.   Bernard Simon Barboux, a Paris-based executive vicepresident of Banque Indosuez, said the acquisition ofGartmore has given Indosuez new prowess in pension-fundmanagement. &quot;Gartmore brings us more pension-fund expertise,&quot;he said. &quot;Indosuez has primarily been involved in unit trustsand mutual funds. We now plan to expand into the pension-fundarea.&quot;   The move into pension-fund management marks a shift incorporate culture at Indosuez Asia. Under Mr. Lloyd George,the company has concentrated on conservatively managed,diversified retail funds invested in the Asian-Pacificregion. Indosuez Asia also has been a pioneer in the region'semerging markets; it launched the first international equityfund that invests in Indonesia, and this month its HimalayanFund became the first to invest in India, Sri Lanka,Bangladesh and Nepal.   Mr. Lloyd George said the new emphasis on pension-fundmoney won't come at the expense of retail clients,particularly those now holding Gartmore funds.   Gartmore funds that will be merged into Indosuez AsiaFunds or re-registered with Hong Kong authorities under theIndosuez name are: Gartmore International Bond Fund, whichwill be merged with Indosuez Asian Income Fund; GartmoreSingapore andamp; Malaysia Trust, to be merged with Indosuez FIFSingapore, a Banque Indosuez fund managed by Indosuez Asia;and Gartmore Precious Metals Trust, to be merged withIndosuez Pacific Gold Fund.   These Gartmore funds will carry the Indosuez Asianameplate: Japan Fund, Oriental Ventures Trust, Hong KongFund, Managed Trust, New Zealand Fund, North American Trust,Pacific Trust, and Pacific Warrant Fund.</TEXT></DOC>
