For their part, Japanese officials are apprehensive overthe amount of pressure U.S. officials might exert in the June25-26 negotiations for more specific commitments on futureactions to open up Japanese markets for more imports andprivate foreign investments.</LP><TEXT>   In advance of these talks, Japanese officials areindicating that they aren't planning to make any newconcessions to the U.S., such as making advance commitmentson the amount of planned public works spending in Japan as apercentage of the country's gross national product.   Japanese officials also are less than enthusiastic aboutanother U.S. proposal that negotiations on structural tradeissues be &quot;institutionalized&quot; in the form of continuingconsultations several times a year, to rehash old issues anddiscuss new ones.   Meanwhile, the new economic &quot;theology&quot; about the merits ofcontinued Japanese international trade surpluses, put forwardby some Japanese &quot;think-tank&quot; experts, is viewed as apotentially troublesome issue, particularly if the Japanesegovernment were to openly endorse such a strategy.   Thus far, U.S. reaction has been low-keyed, but severaltop U.S. economic policy makers have said this idea lacksmerit.   As things stand, the U.S. and Japan are slated to producein mid-July the final versions of their reports on policyactions, both in Tokyo and Washington, to achieve a betterbalance in trade on a longer-term basis.   In interim reports issued in April, both governmentsmanaged to ease some of the tensions in their bilateral traderelations. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and President Bush,who are expected to get together early next month in Houston,ahead of the economic summit, probably will be looking forways to keep things on a smooth track.                                                                                                          Delays in Congress: General Motors Corp. and othercompanies are signing some long-term agreements to supplyequipment and technology to the Soviet Union.   But they may have to wait until September or even longerto know whether Congress will approve a bilateral tradeagreement to reduce U.S. tariffs on Soviet goods and, perhapsmore important, clear the way for the Export-Import Bank tohelp finance exports of goods and services the Russians wantto buy.   Separately, it also may take several months for U.S.companies doing business with China to know, for sure, thatthe U.S. will continue its &quot;most-favored-nation&quot; treatmentfor imports of Chinese-made goods.   The House Ways and Means international trade subcommittee,headed by Rep. Sam Gibbons (D., Fla.) will begin hearingsJune 19 on various bills designed to overturn PresidentBush's decision to extend for one-year most-favored-nationtreatment for Chinese products, which means lower U.S. importduties.   Mr. Gibbons is promising other members of Congress, irkedover the White House decision on China, a comprehensive setof hearings that will explore, among other things, Chinesegovernment policies and the impact of trade and investmentties on the U.S., China and Hong Kong.   Technically, Congress must decide no later than Sept. 3whether to uphold (through inaction) or disapprove (throughlegislative action) the White House China trade decision ofMay 24.   But some House members are proposing entirely newlegislation that would change the ground rules and set newconditions for any future extensions of the U.S. tariffconcessions on imports of apparel, footwear, toys, machineryor other products from China.   On the Soviet Union, U.S. trade-policy officials weresaying recently they couldn't predict how soon President Bushwould formally transmit the bilateral trade agreement withthat country to Congress, coupling this with approval of&quot;waivers&quot; under a 1974 Trade act to lower U.S. import dutieson Soviet exports.   They suggested it won't happen soon because Moscow maytake several months to enact a law allowing unrestrictedemigration of Soviet residents to other countries.   How Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev resolves Moscow'sproblems with the breakaway Baltic states also will be animportant factor in this situation, according tocongressional leaders who discussed this issue with PresidentBush at the White House recently.                                                                                                          Credits To Finance Trade: Although the Soviet Union now isappealing openly for credits from Western nations, includingthe U.S., Moscow hasn't gotten around yet to applying formembership in the International Monetary Fund or the WorldBank, both of which are pumping out funds to other Easternand Central European countries to support economic reforms.   Last week, for example, the World Bank approved a $250million loan to Poland to help expand natural-gas productionin that country. The bank also has assigned experts to helpPoland work out contractual arrangements to attract foreignparticipation in the country's oil industry.   While some Russian officials apparently are claiming thatthey have sought informal, unofficial advice from the IMFabout currency-related issues, IMF officials say that hasn'thappened.   In the bilateral trade agreement negotiated between theU.S. and the Soviet Union, it was agreed that commercialtransactions between these two countries would have to besettled in freely convertible currencies.   In a separate &quot;side-letter&quot; agreement that could createnew drains on Moscow's limited holdings of dollars, theRussians promised to begin discussions with the U.S. onrepaying about $714 million in old U.S. government loans,after the main U.S.-Soviet trade agreement takes effect.   U.S. officials said these old debts include $674 millionin World War II lend-lease accounts, plus $44 million theSoviet Union still owes to the Export-Import Bank on loansapproved many years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
