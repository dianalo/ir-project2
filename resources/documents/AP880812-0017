NRA letters mailed across the country urge the gun lobby'ssupporters to pressure members of Congress to defeat the measure.   But even conservative Republicans who call themselves NRAsupporters said Thursday that the mailings contain factualdistortions, and some of the GOP members are downright angry.   ``They ought to stop beating up on their friends,'' said Rep.John J. Rhodes III, R-Ariz., who is undecided on the legislation.``They are really screwing up their credibility with people whosupported them for a long, long time.''   The NRA especially angered Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.,R-Wis., who said the organization's letter attacking him personallyis ``downright erroneous, false and plays on hysteria in an attemptto get me to change my vote.''   Sensenbrenner said he supports the waiting period and won'tchange his mind.   The NRA official who signed the letters, Wayne LaPierre, saidSensenbrenner was singled out because he wrote his constituentsproclaiming his support for the right to keep and bear arms.   ``You don't have it both ways,'' said LaPierre, director of theNRA's Institute for Legislative Action. ``Everybody knows this is abig gun vote. You're either for gun owners or against gun owners.   ``If someone is going to vote for a bill that takes these rightsaway ... we're going to fight back. That's what sportsmen and gunowners expect us to do.''   The waiting period measure, part of omnibus drug legislationthat the House will vote on in September, would require a seven-daywait in the purchase of a handgun from a licensed dealer.   The dealer must send to law enforcement authorities a swornstatement that includes a description of the gun, the serialnumber, and the name, address and birth date of the buyer. Policemay, but are not required to, conduct a background check.   Purchasers who would be prohibited from buying handguns would bethose already ineligible under existing federal law: convictedfelons, fugitives from justice, illegal aliens, drug addicts, thoseadjudicated mentally ill or committed to a mental institution,those dishonorably discharged from the military and people underindictment for a felony.   Twenty-two states already have enacted a waiting period ofvarying duration.   The NRA contends the waiting period would amount to a nationalregistration of handguns, would cost ``hundreds of millions'' ofdollars to enforce, and would require ``a bureaucrat's permission''to buy a gun.   Conservatives and liberals alike said all these assertions werewrong.   But conservative House members targeted for pressure said thatperhaps the ultimate insult was the NRA's attempt to link them toliberals who support gun control.   LaPierre wrote Sensenbrenner's constituents: ``I have in my handa letter dated July 1988 from the Sensenbrenner Campaign Committeefor Re-Election proclaiming his fight for gun owners' rights ...HA. With support like that, you might as well have Ted Kennedyrepresenting you.''   Kennedy, D-Mass., is one of the most liberal senators and is astrong supporter of handgun control.   While other versions of the letter do not attack individuallawmakers, they make the same points about the legislation.   The NRA contended that backers of the bill ``want the police tovisit your home before you can buy a firearm, yet police right nowdon't have the resources to send cruisers to investigateresidential burglaries in many areas.''   LaPierre defended the statement even though no such language isin the bill. He said it was a response to statements made bybackers of the legislation that police would drive by homes tocheck addresses on a gun purchaser's forms.   Responding to a criticism of Sensenbrenner, LaPierreacknowledged that the NRA supported waiting periods in the early1970s, but changed its mind a few years later when it found ``theydon't stop crime. It's simply red tape for honest people.''   Other lawmakers angered by the NRA campaign included Rep. DanLungren, R-Calif., a Judiciary Committee member who has backed pastNRA positions; and Rep. Herbert H. Bateman, R-Va., who considershimself a strong supporter of the right to own guns.   Lungren called the attack on Sensenbrenner ``a pretty desperateletter against one of their supporters.''   Bateman said, ``I am shocked and disappointed at the excessivelanguage and tactics used by the NRA in the letter to myconstituents.''</TEXT></DOC>
