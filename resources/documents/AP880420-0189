PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A parliamentary commission Wednesday approved theU.S.-Soviet treaty banning intermediate-range missiles, setting thestage for Soviet ratification before the Moscow summit.   Commission chairman Giorgy M. Kornienko also told a newsconference that it would be difficult, but still possible, toconclude a treaty cutting strategic nuclear weapons by the time ofPresident Reagan's May 29-June 2 visit.   But he said progress on strategic weapons depends on whatSecretary of State George P. Shultz says when he arrives in Moscowon Thursday.   Kornienko said that at a meeting Wednesday a special commissionset up by the foreign relations commissions of the two houses ofthe Soviet parliament came to a ``positive conclusion on the issueof ratifying the treaty.''   The matter will be returned to the foreign affairs commissionsof the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities and thento the collective presidency, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.   The commissions will consider the recommendation at the regularspring meeting of the Supreme Soviet in May, Kornienko said. ThePresidium may then ratify the treaty.   Western diplomats who follow the Soviet lawmaking process saythe full 1,500-member Supreme Soviet can be expected to endorse thePresidium's decision at the spring meeting.   The Soviet government is going through a detailed ratificationprocess, but final approval is a formality because the treatysigned by Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Dec. 8 already hasbeen approved by the Communist Party, the country's dominant force.   In Washington, the White House prodded the Senate to ratify thetreaty and said it would be ``most unfortunate'' if the agreementis not ratified by the time Reagan goes to Moscow.   The treaty, banning all U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles withranges between 300 and 3,400 miles, is not expected to come to theSenate floor until May 9 at the earliest.   Kornienko's commission began its hearings in February and heldseveral sessions to which foreign correspondents were invited.   Kornienko said it considered the concerns of Soviet citizensexpressed in letters to the commission and to the official presswhether the treaty damages Soviet security and came to theconclusion that it does not.   ``The security and defense capabilities of the Soviet Union andits allies will be on the same level, and Soviet people should notbe concerned about that,'' he said.   The commission also concluded that the treaty would not causewide unemployment or other social or economic problems. Destructionof the missiles according to terms of the treaty will not causeecological damage, he said.   The commission expressed concern about the calls in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization for compensation for the U.S. Pershing2 and cruise missiles that are being eliminated under the treaty,Kornienko said.   Shultz's visit to Moscow is one of a series he and SovietForeign Minister Eduard A. Shervardnadze are conducting before thefourth meeting between Reagan and Gorbachev.   The two sides are trying to work out the details of an agreementto cut their arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles by 50 percent.   Kornienko said Reagan and Gorbachev reached a basis for anagreement during their December summit in Washington, but that soonafterward at the Geneva negotiations ``we faced the unpreparednessof the American side to go ahead at the pace necessary for signingat the Moscow meeting.''   He said an accord depends on agreement on the U.S. program for aspace-based shield against nuclear attack and adherence to the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The Soviets say the missile program,popularly known as ``Star Wars,'' is a violation of the ABM treaty.   Officials said this week that U.S. and Soviet negotiatorsidentified about 1,200 disputed items in the strategic weaponstreaty, about half of them technical problems that could beresolved if major verification problems are worked out.   Negotiators say that among the other problems to be worked outare the detection and counting of mobile and cruise missilescarried on planes and warships.   Kornienko said another meeting between Shultz and Shevardnadzecould be held before Reagan's visit to Moscow.</TEXT></DOC>
