The president, who underwent surgery for colon cancer in July1985, will undergo a colonoscopy, a chest X-ray, a CAT scan, acardiac stress test and a pulmonary function evaluation, Hutton said.   Mrs. Reagan, who had her left breast removed in October 1987,will have her second mammogram since undergoing the modified radicalmastectomy, Hutton said.   Following the exams, the couple will go to Camp David, Md., forthe weekend, the statement said.   In Reagan's initial surgery, doctors removed a two-inch cancerouspolyp and nearly two feet of his colon as well as the surroundingtissue.   Since 1985 and up until last January, Reagan had a colonoscopyevery six months to check for any recurrence of cancer. Each time,doctors found polyps _ or small, fleshy growths _ and removed them.They were all found to be non-cancerous.   No polyps were found in his last such examination in January ofthis year. Reagan did not have such a checkup this summer.   The colonoscopy is an examination of the large intestine with along, flexible instrument that uses fiber optic technology to allowdoctors to see inside the bowel.   The CAT scan is a computerized three-dimensional X-ray of theinternal organs.</TEXT></DOC>
