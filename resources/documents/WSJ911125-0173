Klein</HL><DATE>11/25/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><LP>   Oakland, Calif. -- There are several ways to regard theearly part of a National Basketball Association schedule thatconsumes about as many months and miles as a probe of Venus.One is to ignore it altogether and focus instead on suchseasonal sports as football and indoor tennis. Another is togive the newspaper box scores a quick-enough scan to see ifthe Sacramento Kings won a road game (they did]). A third isto save your attention until Michael Jordan comes to yourtown or tube.   A fourth, and my favorite, is to use the warm-up period tosniff the new flowers that every season produces, fullyexpecting that they won't be quite as fragrant by the timethe league gets around to the serious business of picking achampion come April, May and June.</LP><TEXT>   The current campaign isn't yet a month old but already ithas sent up some interesting specimens. The Miami Heat andOrlando Magic, newish clubs which had heretofore beendistinguished only by their singular nicknames and losingrecords, are off and running near the top of the NBA'sAtlantic Division. Benoit Benjamin seems to have found hisbalance after several seasons as an overweight underachiever,and his Seattle Supersonics have taken off nicely. TheHouston Rockets, another team with a space-age moniker,haven't faltered on the launching pad as in previous annums.   The brightest blossom, though, may be the Golden StateWarriors, whose 120-115 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks onSaturday night in Oakland-Alameda County coliseum advancedtheir record to 9-3. Not only was that the best mark in thePacific Division, but it has been achieved mostly in thequite-unNBAlike fashion of winning six of seven games on theroad over such blue-ribbon foes as the Chicago Bulls andPortland Trail Blazers. Any bunch that can do that may bemore than a hothouse wonder.   One fella who professes to be amazed as well as amused bythe Warriors' hot start is their coach and general manager,Don Nelson. He points out that his starting lineup --including two rookies and a second-year man -- has to beamong the greenest in pro hoops. &quot;We're young, and I thoughtwe'd be lucky to keep our heads above water for the firstcouple months,&quot; he said after Saturday's fray. &quot;It'sgratifying we've done as well as we have, but I don't thinkwe're as good as our record.&quot;   But he added: &quot;Don't get me wrong; it's nice to have thewins. They'll come in handy while we're building.&quot;   If anyone can put the Warriors' together in a morepermanent way, Nelson is the man; he's probably the bestcoach never to win a championship in the league. He was headman at Milwaukee for 11 seasons before heading west in 1988,and his 14 coaching seasons have produced a nearly-60%won-lost average, 11 playoff berths and seven divisionalcrowns.   None of those titles have come in the Bay Area, but he hasdone the next-best thing here, which is to fashion a quick,slick-passing squad whose brand of basketball puts fannies inthe seats; Saturday's full house of 15,025 was the team's108th straight, dating from 1989. Three players -- TimHardaway, Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin -- so epitomizedthat dashing style that a newspaper had a contest to find anickname for the trio, and the winning entry of &quot;RUN TMC&quot; socaptured the local fancy that it reduced the Warriors to akind of subsidiary.   Trouble was that while Tim, Mitch and Chris were running,bigger teams were piling up better records with moretraditional styles. Nelson noticed, and on opening day tradedRichmond and other consideration to Sacramento for the rightsto Billy Owens, the third player chosen in the last collegedraft. Although many wondered aloud if he'd be an improvementover the beloved Mitch, Nelson would be happy if he were fourinches better. That's the difference in height between the6-foot-9 Owens and the 6-5 Richmond.   &quot;We needed Billy's size and the versatility he gives us,&quot;said the coach. &quot;He's a piece I can use inside or outside.&quot;   Nelson likes to talk about players as &quot;pieces,&quot; no offensemeant, and in Mullin and Hardaway he has two of the best.Mullin, who mostly plays forward, is a shooter par excellencewhose 25.7 points per game average was the league's eighthbest last season. Hardaway is a guard who's come to be knownas the &quot;King of the Crossover.&quot; That's a dribble move inwhich a player bounces the ball between his legs with onehand and retrieves it with the other. Lots of players can doit standing still. Hardaway can do it in full flight.   Owens is an ex-Syracuse U. flash who should fit in wellwith those guys once he tunes his body to the pro grind. TheWarriors want him to do what he often did in college, whichis take down a rebound, whip the ball out to a guard, andreach the distant basket in time to cap a fast break with adunk. If Owens doesn't get the rebound, Nelson hopes thateither Tyrone Hill, a 6-9 second-year man, or rookie VictorAlexander, a 6-9, 285-pound Baby Huey, will. They usuallystart, though they don't always finish.   Otherwise, Nelson has a bunch of &quot;pieces&quot; who can playwherever the situation demands. He cherishes and collectsthat type. Sarunas Marciulionis, a muscular 6-5er out ofVilnius State U. (that's in Lithuania) is one, 6-7 vet RodHiggins is another, and Vincent Askew, a 225-pound guard whowears size 15 shoes, is a third. &quot;He's not afraid to put hisbody on the big guys,&quot; says the coach of Askew. Neither arethe others.   On Friday night, at Portland, Marciulionis drove the laneand passed off to Mullin for a winning, 18-foot jump shot. OnSaturday, a rugged Milwaukee team upset the Warriors' passinggame by closely shadowing Mullin and Hardaway, and Owens leftearly with a sprained ankle, so Marciulionis took chargeagain, flinging himself down the lane for baskets or freethrows after he was hacked. He scored 21 of his game-high 26points in the second half, and all were needed.   &quot;It was a struggle. We survived,&quot; said Nelson.   But he was being too modest. The Warriors are prospering,at least for now.</TEXT></DOC>
