For the expected strongest performer, Burlington NorthernInc., earnings growth reflected robust coal and grainshipments and the company's limited exposure to the vagariesof new automobile shipments. But even railroads that are moreheavily dependent upon industrial freight shipments faredreasonably well, analysts said, reflecting vigorouscost-cutting.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The railroads' improved efficiency is boosting earningsin a lackluster economy,&quot; said Gary Yablon, an analyst atWertheim Schroder andamp; Co., who expects the group'ssecond-quarter profit from continuing operations &quot;to be up inthe mid-single digits.&quot; Mr. Yablon said railroads havetightened scheduling of freight trains, lowered car-hirecosts, reduced manpower, cut material use, and reducedlittle-used track.   A Burlington Northern spokesman said the company is&quot;comfortable&quot; with analysts' estimates that second-quarternet income was about 81 cents a share compared with 74 centsa share in the year-earlier period. The spokesman saidcontinued growth in coal shipments reflected new contractswith utilities in the railroad's territory and test shipmentsof low-sulfur Western coal to utilities in the Midwest andEast concerned about more stringent air pollution standards.He added that Burlington Northern benefited from highershipments of corn to West Coast ports from the Midwest.   CSX Corp., the only member of the group to discloseresults, reported last week that second-quarter net incomedropped 28%. However, CSX's earnings from continuingoperations rose 20%, reflecting improved results at rail,barging and container shipping units.   Analysts said that they expect Consolidated Rail Corp. topost moderately higher earnings but that per-share earningsfor Union Pacific Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. will beflat.   Some analysts say rail operations were disappointing atSanta Fe Pacific Corp., which faces tough competition forfreight from trucks and other railroads. Estimates of SantaFe's second-quarter earnings range from nil to two cents ashare. In the 1989 quarter, Santa Fe had net of $2.7 million,or two cents a share. A Santa Fe spokesman wouldn't commenton analysts' projections.   Rail carloadings at the major railroads were up 1.3%,according to the Association of American Railroads. Shipmentsof coal rose 5.8%, chemicals were up 3.6%, and metalsincreased 3.2%. Grain carloads were off about half a percent.Carloadings of some higher-value freight were down, withmotor vehicles declining 4%, lumber 8.3% and paper less than1%.   Some analysts were cheered by the overall traffic gain.&quot;At this time a year ago tonnage was sliding, but now tonnageis improving,&quot; said Andras Petery, an analyst at MorganStanley andamp; Co.   Michael Lloyd, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., saidhe is encouraged by rail shipments of finished automobiles,which improved toward the end of the second quarter after avery weak beginning. However, Mr. Lloyd believes that theimprovement partly reflects inventory -- building inanticipation of a strike by the United Auto Workers union,whose contract expires in September.   &quot;I'm worried that the stocks of the railroads will respondpositively to near-term traffic trends, trapping investorsfor possible disappointment this fall,&quot; Mr. Lloyd said.   When CSX reported that second-quarter net dropped to $109million from $151 million, CSX said that earnings in the 1989second period were inflated by gains from the sale ofsubsidiaries. CSX said rail pretax operating profit rose7.8%, reflecting improved coal tonnage that offset the extraexpense of an expanded locomotive repair program. Autotraffic, while not reaching levels of the year-ago quarter,improved sharply from the first period of 1990, the companysaid. CSX said operating profit rose 40% at itscontainer-shipping unit, Sea-Land Service Inc., whileoperating profit jumped 25% at the barge unit, reflectingstrong coal shipments and expanded operations at the marineconstruction division.   Some analysts expect Conrail to report second-quarter netincome of $1.30 to $1.40 a share compared with net of $1.19 ashare a year ago. One analyst said second-quarter resultsincluded an after-tax gain of about 21 cents a share fromsale of a branch line. Conrail officials wouldn't comment onanalysts' estimates other than to say that traffic levels are&quot;relatively flat.&quot;   Union Pacific officials said per-share earnings were aboutthe same as the $1.41 a share earned in the 1989 secondperiod, but net income fell slightly, reflecting higherinterest expense related to a share-repurchase program. Theofficials cited earnings improvements at its rail, truck,hazardous waste and real estate units. The officials saidearnings of the company's oil and gas unit won't matchafter-tax earnings of $55 million in the year-ago quarter,which included a $17 million gain on gas contractsettlements. Higher gas volumes in the recent quarter offsetprice declines in oil and gas and flat oil volumes, theofficials said.   They added that the rail unit benefited from a 1%improvement in carloadings and a reduction in railroad workforce to 31,500 from 32,800 a year ago.   Norfolk Southern wouldn't comment on analysts' projectionsthat net income was flat at 99 cents a share.</TEXT></DOC>
