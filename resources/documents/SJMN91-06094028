The problem, according to Boss, was thatthe operating room at the clinic was slightly smaller than the state agencyrequires for tubal ligations paid for by Medi-Cal.;    Boss said his clinichas now asked the state Department of Health Services for certification toallow it to do tubal ligations for women receiving Medi-Cal benefits. He saidhe'd been told that the clinic should have that authorization within a fewweeks.;    Elinor Hall, head of the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency,called the waiver &quot;good news, very good news.&quot;;    Hall, members of the boardof supervisors and other county officials, as well as representatives ofwomen's groups and numerous community organizations, expressed concern aboutthe problem after Dominican Hospital took over Community Hospital in SantaCruz last year, eliminating the only non-Catholic hospital in the north end ofthe county.;    &quot;I'm very pleased with this,&quot; Hall said Tuesday.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LEE QUARNSTROM, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910403  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  305  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 3, 199100094028,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
