The consultations began as judicial investigators named two ofPapandreou's former Cabinet ministers in a bribery inquiry and askedParliament to lift immunity so that they can be prosecuted. The twoministers named are former Deputy Premier Agamemnon Koutsogiorgasand Public Order Minister George Petsos.   At the same time, Koutsogiorgas' wife, Aliki, was among threepeople charged with involvement in the alleged payment of a $2million bribe to Koutsogiorgas.   The reports of bribery and corruption involving leaders inPapandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Party led to its defeat inSunday's parliamentary election.   Conservative leader Constantine Mitsotakis and Harilaos Florakis,the leader of a communist-dominated alliance, said the prosecutionof those involved in the scandals dominated their talks.   ``We remained absolutely agreed on one thing, the issue ofcatharsis and the scandals must not be written off,'' said Florakis,whose alliance holds a decisive hand in forming a coalitiongovernment.   ``The dominant issue now is catharsis and political developmentsmust be oriented toward this objective,'' Mitsotakis said.   Latest election results announced Wednesday gave Mitsotakis' NewDemocracy Party 145 seats in the 300-member Parliament, six seatsshort of the required majority. Papandreou, who has led Greece since1981, won 125 seats. Florakis' alliance took 29 seats.   The post-election posturing has taken on new significance in thelight of the corruption inquiry.   Under the Greek Constitution, only the present or subsequentParliament has the power to lift the ministers' parliamentaryimmunity and prosecute them. If no new government is formed and anew election is called, those elected parliamentarians would beunable to prosecute them.   Mrs. Koutsogiorgas was charged with opening a joint Swiss bankaccount with her husband where a bribe was deposited. The indictmentsaid the $2 million was a bribe to Koutsogiorgas, who was alsoJustice Minister, for approving a banking law that helped hideirregularities in the Bank of Crete.   Also charged were bank owner George Koskotas and Kosotos' lawyer,Yannis Mantzouranis.   Mantzouranis, who also was the secretary of Papandreou's councilof ministers, was charged with arranging the bribe, and with keepingan unspecified amount of the $2 million.   Koskotas was charged with embezzling the $2 million and withbribing Koutsogiorgas. He is in prison in the United States awaitingthe hearing of an extradition demand by the Greek government.   No date was announced for a judicial hearing against thosecharged.   In the parliamentary request, the magistrates accusedKoutsogiorgas of accepting bribes while in office and Petsos withaccepting gifts.   Parliament Speaker Yannis Alevras said the evidence against thetwo ministers would be kept secret until its presentation to thefirst session of the new Parliament, scheduled for July 3.   Consultations to form a coalition government are expected tocontinue until next week. Each of the three party leaders is givengiven three days to try to accomplish this, with Mistotakis havingthe first go.</TEXT></DOC>
