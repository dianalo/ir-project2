<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-83-0651 </DOCNO><TEXT>A description is provided of IRUS (Intrusion Resistant Underground Structure),a belowground vault intended for LLRW with a hazardous lifetime of 500years, and scheduled to start accepting wastes in 1991. The Randamp;D programsin support of IRUS are concentrating on the optimization of barrier materials,such as concrete and buffer layers, and on understanding the chemistryand physics of the processing occurring within the vault. Safety assessmentsusing the COSMOS S/D code have shown that the risks to the critical populationfrom IRUS are well within regulatory limits.</TEXT></DOC>
