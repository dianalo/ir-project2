The three said they found that even if computer modelspredicting global warming are correct, it will be many yearsbefore the predicted changes in temperatures andprecipitation will be large enough to stand out in theweather records. The models predict the Great Plains andcentral U.S. will suffer a warming and a drop inprecipitation, suggesting increasing bouts of drought.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;These analyses leave planners and policy makers in anunenviable position&quot; of having to decide whether to use ordismiss the computer projections of global climate changeswithout knowing how valid the projections are, declared threemeteorologists with the Commerce Department's NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate laboratory inAsheville, N.C. The analyses by Thomas R. Karl, Richard R.Heim Jr. and Robert G. Quayle were published in this week'sissue of the journal Science.   &quot;We aren't making any judgment on the accuracy of the{global warming} models,&quot; Mr. Heim emphasized. Their aim wasto see how soon a warming of the climate will show up in aparticular region, the central U.S. in this case.   The three researchers noted that there are three computermodels of the Earth's climate that have predicted that aglobal warming is being caused by human activity spewingincreasing amounts of carbon dioxide, methane and other gasesinto the atmosphere.   The three computer models simulate what happens to theclimate if the greenhouse gases continue to accumulate atpresent and predicted rates. They show, for instance, that inthe central part of North America summer rainfall willdecrease, winter precipitation will increase and temperatureswill rise.   The climatologists analyzed the weather records for thecentral U.S. back to 1895 and failed to find any trends intemperatures and precipitation of the kind predicted by thecomputer climate models.   For example, the computer models say that if the averageglobal temperature rises by 1.8 degrees Celsius over 40 yearsthen the central U.S. would experience a 15% increase inwinter precipitation and a 5% to 10% drop in summer rainfall.In fact, the weather records show that winter precipitationhas decreased instead of increasing and that summer rainfallhas dropped only slightly.   On the other hand, temperatures did rise slightly in thecentral U.S. over the past 95 years, consistent with, butsmaller than, the projections of the computer models. Thetrend, however, wasn't statistically significant.   To see how soon the greenhouse effect would stand out fromthe natural weather changes, the researchers imposed thecomputer-projected changes on the kind of natural weatherchanges seen in the past for the central U.S. They assumedthat a 1.8degree rise in the average global temperature wouldoccur by the year 2030 and that 0.5 degrees, or 28%, of thischange has already occurred.   &quot;Another 15 to 20 years would be required for thedetection of summer temperature changes,&quot; they said. &quot;Between15 and 30 years would be required for the detection of winter{temperature} changes&quot; depending on which computer model isused and how much of the warming has already occurred, theysaid.   Detecting the projected greenhouse-induced changes in rainand snow fall will take as long as 40 years, they said. &quot;Ifthe precipitation changes were about twice as large as thoseprojected, we probably could detect the changes by about2020,&quot; they added.</TEXT></DOC>
