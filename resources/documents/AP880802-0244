New Orleans in August means high temperatures about 90.3 degreesand relative humidity that rarely dives below 50 percent.   The heat index _ a formula used by the National Weather Servicethat combines both heat and humidity _ hovers close to 100.   Perspiration doesn't evaporate in the damp air and the onlyrespite from the sticky heat comes in the form of briefthundershowers that hit almost every day.   Convention officials plan to use awnings, covered walkways andair conditioned convention vehicles in an attempt to help thoseunaccustomed to such unkind conditions.   Hurricanes are another summer weather worry, although the stormsare more likely to threaten later in the year.   Convention manager Bill Philips said the city would have severaldays notice should a hurricane or tropical storm form in the Gulfand head toward the city. He said plans and schedules would have tobe adjusted on a day-to-day basis to ensure convention-goers'safety.   But he added, ``I'm more concerned about the humidity.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 7</NOTE></DOC>
