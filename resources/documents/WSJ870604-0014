Traders conceded that they overreacted in pummeling the dollar after the announcement that Paul Volcker will step down as head of the Fed and that Alan Greenspan was nominated as his successor.    In an effort to calm financial markets, top government officials around the world yesterday voiced support and approval over the Greenspan nomination. They said they expect he will continue the U.S.'s current monetary policies and its cooperation with major allies.    &quot;There's a perception that Alan Greenspan isn't as bad as was feared,&quot; said Michael Snow, senior vice president, foreign exchange, at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. Tuesday &quot;was an overreaction,&quot; and yesterday &quot;was a return to normalcy,&quot; he said.    The dollar stood at 143.40 Japanese yen in late New York trading, a 1.5% increase from 141.23 late Tuesday. The U.S. currency also climbed 0.9% to 1.8118 West German marks from 1.7958. The British pound fell 1% to $1.6318 from $1.6480.    Calm also returned to the currency markets in Tokyo, where Japanese officials voiced support for the economist named to run the Fed. Japan's central bank intervened to buy small amounts of dollars to bolster the U.S. currency, traders said.    Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told reporters he expects no major U.S. policy changes to result from Mr. Volcker's departure.    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita called Mr. Greenspan, his prospective U.S. counterpart, &quot;a man of deep insight.&quot; He said he expects cooperation between the U.S. and its major allies in pursuit of exchange-rate stability to continue with Mr. Greenspan running the Fed.    In London, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said he was &quot;absolutely&quot; saddened by Mr. Volcker's decision not to stay at the Fed after his second four-year term ends in August. But he said he is confident that Mr. Greenspan has &quot;the qualifications to take over.&quot;    Traders, meanwhile, were concluding that Tuesday's dollar sell-off wasn't justified by the personnel change at the Fed. That move was &quot;definitely overdone in all markets,&quot; Victor Polce, vice president, foreign exchange, at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York, said.    &quot;There really isn't that much difference between Volcker and Greenspan except that across the oceans, Greenspan is less well known,&quot; he said.    Some traders, however, still see little reason to buy the dollar. They acknowledge that technical analysis of the currency's mostly upward move since mid-May indicates continued advances. But any analysis of economic factors, particularly the U.S. trade and budget deficits, points to a lower dollar, they say.    &quot;I don't see any real good reason to be any more interested in buying dollars today than a week ago,&quot; Leslie A. Puth, a trader at Banque Indosuez in New York, said. &quot;Certainly nothing noteworthy has come out to support the dollar. We'll probably move up higher, but I can't think of any fundamental reasons.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $6 an ounce to $450.20 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was three million ounces.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 143.90 yen.    Gold was quoted at $448.25 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Wednesday, June 3, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
