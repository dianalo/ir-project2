WHITING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A freighter that embarked from Philadelphia morethan two years ago with a cargo of toxic waste that no country wouldaccept has reached Singapore.   Now called the Pelicano, the vessel is believed to have startedits odyssey Aug. 31, 1986, with 14,000 tons of municipal andindustrial incinerator ash under the name Khian Sea, according topublished reports and shipping sources. It was renamed the Feliciaduring a stop for repairs in Yugoslavia in July, these sources said.   ``We don't want the Pelicano to come in,'' an official of thePort of Singapore Authority said Thursday.   ``There is no need to give reasons. We don't know its country ofregistration. The vessel is anchored outside Singapore ininternational waters and has been there for about three days,'' saidthe official, who insisted on anonymity.   In a radio-telephone call to the ship by The Associated Press, aman who said he was the captain, declined to answer questions orgive his name.   The Straits Times newspaper Thursday quoted a crew member assaying in another phone call that the ship originally carried toxicwaste but disposed of it.   It said the crew member confirmed the ship was previously knownas Khian Sea and Felicia.   The Felicia was last sighted early this month off Sri Lanka whereit was denied entry, according to Lloyd's List, a shippingnewsletter. There were unconfirmed reports then that it was headingtoward the Philippines.   The environmentalist group Greenpeace said earlier this week thatthe ship dumped its cargo somewhere in the Indian Ocean. SpokeswomanUta Bellion said Greenpeace learned this from shipping sources.   At least 11 countries on four continents spurned the toxic waste.A report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said the cargocontained aluminum, arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, mercury,nickel, zinc and dioxins.   Other ships are involved in toxic transport, but because of thelength of its voyage the wayward freighter came to symbolize theproblem of toxic dumping, particularly in the Third World.   Greenpeace estimates at least 11 developing countries have takenin waste from the United States and Europe since 1986, while 38 morewere approached. The EPA said about 2.2 million tons of toxicgarbage crosses international borders each year.   Said to have been registered in Liberia, the Bahamas and Hondurasat different times, the Khian Sea spent 18 months wandering theCaribbean seeking an unloading port after leaving Philadelphia.Between 2,000 and 4,500 tons of waste were left in Haiti before theship made an unsuccessful attempt to enter Delaware Bay, shippingsources said.   Senegal in West Africa next rejected the vessel before it went tothe Mediterranean and then the Indian Ocean.   In another phone call to the ship Thursday, The Associated Presswas told by a crewman who refused to identify himself that the shiphad no cargo on board.   Asked where the vessel was bound, he said it had ``no furtherinstruction from the owners, Romo Shipping of Greece.''   The freighter was anchored five miles southwest of the Malaysianstate of Johor, near Singapore's Sultan Shoal lighthouse.   The Port of Singapore Authority spokesman said it was being keptunder surveillance.</TEXT></DOC>
