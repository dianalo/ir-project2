The lawyer, George F. Pavarini, sent regular newsletters and statements to investors falsely reporting they were making money, according to the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office, which brought the charges. In fact, the investment fund began losing money in 1982, the prosecutors said.    Mr. Pavarini also tricked investors into thinking the fund was profitable by making occasional payments to them from money he received from law clients and new investors, said Anne Ryan, assistant U.S. attorney.    The scheme was uncovered by the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed a civil suit Thursday against Mr. Pavarini and his Pavtec Hedge Funds. The SEC said Mr. Pavarini, 47 years old, agreed to a civil settlement under which his personal assets and those of the funds are frozen. He neither admits nor denies wrongdoing. The SEC estimates that about $158,000 remains in the funds.    According to Ms. Ryan, Mr. Pavarini is scheduled to enter guilty pleas today to the two criminal charges: operating an unregistered investment fund and mail fraud. He also faces the possibility of disbarment. Mr. Pavarini's attorney, Barry Mandel, couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
