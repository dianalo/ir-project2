 Sun acknowledges that it needsmuch more than this-naming services, time synchronization services, andauthentication services to start-and promises to build additional componentsinto ONC.andM;Sun recently announced its  Road Map&quot; for extending ONC.andP;  The plan is vintageSun, stressing time to market and aggressive marketing.andP;  However, Sun alsosignaled that it will produce the ONC distributed environment using internaldevelopment projects, as opposed to working with partners.andP;  LicensingNetwise's RPC Tool, then, was an anomaly.andP;  This approach contrasts with theOpen Software Foundation (OSF) strategy, which is built on technologypartnering (see illustration above).andM;SUN'S RATIONALE.andP;  Corporate users have been clamoring for an end to the RPCwars.andP;  At the Patricia Seybold's Technology Forum in April, the call for asingle standard was loud and clear.andP;  Yet Sun is portraying its ONC strategyas serving the needs of users who have already invested in NFS and ONC.andM;Sun has a responsibility to its installed base, and it is committed tocarrying forward ONC.andP;  Company executives note that Sun has signed up manymore users and can claim more applications than the Apollo division ofHewlett-Packard, its archrival, for its competing Network Computing System.andO;How, they ask, could the OSF turn its back on such market support?andM;The answer to that question reveals the risks of Sun's approach.andP;  Theindustry's transition to distributed computing has just begun.andP;  Sun'sfoundation for this new era is NFS, a solution originally designed to supportworkgroups that is, for the most part, untested in larger settings.andP;  Sun issaying to its customers: Trust us to add the services you'll need in thefuture to what you have installed today.andM;The OSF and the participants in its Distributed Computing Environment want tomake sure that customers have a solid architectural foundation as they startimplementing distributed computing applications in a big way.andP;  OSF's platformdescribes services to support both localized and enterprise-scaleapplications.andP;  Interestingly, the components of Sun's architecture fordistributed applications are the same as those identified by the OSF for itsDCE.andM;Sun's marketing rationale is also disingenuous because it fails to considermigration as an option for users.andP;  For years, IBM, Digital EquipmentCorporation, Hewlett-Packard, and others have been crafting migration pathsto bridge customers' existing investments in technology and emergingtechnologies.andP;  Migration is a fact of life as technology changes.andP;  Accordingto Sun, customers will migrate, too, but within ONC.andP;  Sun believes itscustomers are loyal and will follow its ONC path.andM;WHAT'S IN THE ONC PLAN.andP;  There's not much new in Sun's ONC Road Map.andP;  Sun iscommitting to deliver new time/synchronization services, new authenticationservices, and improvements to its Network Information Service (formerlycalled Yellow Pages) and NFS during the next two to three years (see table onpage 20).andM;The Road Map doesn't provide very many new features.andP;  Sun had previouslyannounced its intention to move to Netwise's RPC Tool, superseding its ownRPC/GEN.andP;  Netwise's RPC Tool will compile into Sun's External DataRepresentation's  (XDR's) canonical format and eventually give users theoption of compiling to OSI's ASN.1 format.andP;  The Transport Layer Interface(TLI) incorporated in Unix System V Release 4 will provide the transportindependence.andM;A Base Architecture.andP;  The Road Map is notable in setting out Sun's view ofwhat comprises a distributed computing environment.andP;  Sun's approach is morefocused than OSF'S.andP;  Then again, at some point, Sun will have to figure outhow to add some or all of the services outlined in the OSF architecture.andM;The following are the other improvements Sun plans to make on the ONC we knowof today:andM;RPC Improvements.andP;  Along with the RPC Tool, Sun win introduce two new RPCfeatures to its users.andP;  First, it w supply an asynchronous call facility.andO;This allows an application to continue working even as it waits for theresults of an RPC to be returned.andP;  Previously, Sun's RPC  blocked&quot; the flowof an application while an RPC was serviced.andP;  Asynchronous RPCs will first beused to take advantage of multiprocessing hardware, next in parallelprocessing.andM;Sun has also committed to implementing the threads model for RPCs next year.andO;Currently, Sun o the lightweight process model.andP;  Again, threads are in linewith the requirements of multi- and parallel-processing.andP;  NFS Enhancements.andO;Sun has committed to four improvements to NFS.andP;  First, Sun will use acombination of tuning and local disk-caching to increase performance.andP;  One ofSun's goals in improving NFS's performance is to allow more desktops per NFSserver.andM;Second, Sun will make NSF networks easier to administer with new tools andwith integration of existing tools into its SunNet Manager network managementsoftware.andP;  Third, Sun will add file replication as a way to provide read-onlyNFS operations, thus improving overall reliability.andM;Last, Sun will add the Kerberos authentication scheme as a security optionfor users.andP;  Actually, Kerberos fits into a separate group of authenticationservice enhancements in the Road Map.andP;  Authentication Services.andP;  NET'sKerberos, which is also part of OSF's DCE, is an interim solution withinSun's ONC.andP;  Sun will offer Kerberos as well as its existing Secure RPC asauthentication services.andP;  Kerberos maintains a database of clients, each ofwhich has a private key known only to iL The Kerberos scheme also providesfor message encryption.andP;  Secure RPC is an optional mode of Sun's RPC thatprovides much of the function of Kerberos.andP;  In the secure mode, the RPCenforces user name and password security in an encrypted formal Sun currentlyoffers the federal Data Encryption Standard (DES) formalandM;Sun is offering Kerberos because Kerberos has emerged as a standard.andP;  Thestrategic direction for ONC, however, is to improve its Secure RPC incombination with security enhancements to its Network Information Service(NIS).andP;  Sun is particularly concerned about accommodating both private keysand the public keys of outside clients.andP;  In its ultimate authenticationmodel, RPCs will retrieve keys from a secure naming service.andP;  Sun is workingon this enhancement itself.andM;Naming Services.andP;  Sun's Network Information Service win be the basis for adistributed Naming Service in ONC.andP;  Sun is improving the consistency of itscurrent product by adding a synchronization mechanism between directories andallowing multiple instances of a name.andP;  It is also adding a location andbinding interface that will allow network objects to automatically registerthemselves with NIS and allow application clients to locate and bind to thenetwork services.andM;Sun is also moving toward an object-oriented naming approach by addingsecurity attributes to the information NIS stores about users and reSourcesattached to the network.andM;Sun is positioning NIS as a superset of the X.500 standard for directoryservices, and it is committing to interoperate with X.500 directories.andO;Time/Synchronization Services.andP;  To synchronize the time on networks withworld standard time, Sun is adopting the Internet's Network Time Protocol(NTP) as part of ONC.andP;  NTP provides an absolute time throughout the networkand coordinates that time with the world time standard.andM;CONCLUSIONS.andP;  Despite our preference for an immediate end to the RPC war,we're encouraged that Sun's new ONC Road Map at least brings it into closeralignment with OSF.andP;  The Road Map identifies a subset of the services OSFincluded in its DCE.andP;  There's hope that, as time passes, Sun's architecturewill evolve to be virtually indistinguishable from OSF'S.andP;  Sun itselfacknowledges that the OSF initiative caused it to whip its uncoordinatedresearch projects to extend ONC into a structure and a set of priorities.andM;But, for the moment, Sun will fight OSF and the backers of its DCE.andP;  Givenits position as the market leader, this is certainly understandable.andP;  There'sno business imperative for Sun to join in an industry-wide effort right now.andM;Sun has always operated with a lot of self-confidence.andP;  The danger for Sun isletting its confidence become corporate hubris.andP;  The latest slogan inventedby Sun CEO Scott McNealy is, &quot;All of our wood behind one arrowhead,&quot; with thewood being the SPARC RISC chips, Unix System V.4, ONC, and OpenLook.andP;  Sun isdeveloping d= of these four technologies by itself, which is a big, big jobeven for a multibillion dollar company.andP;  We expect Sun to Telax its defiantstance over time to grab the technologies it needs to satisfy its marketimperatives.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
