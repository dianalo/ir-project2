Also Wednesday, Iran-based guerrilla leaders were quoted assaying plans were under way for an offensive near Kabul.   In Singapore, an Afghan resistance leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,said the resistance plans to shift its interim government this weekfrom Pakistan to the ``liberated'' Afghanistan provinces of Kunarand Paktia.   Hekmatyar, foreign minister of the interim government set up inFebruary by several guerrilla groups, told a news conferenceWednesday that the entire Cabinet would move within the ``next twoto three days,'' some ministries to Asadabad, capital of Kunar, andothers to a site still be decided in Paktia.   Hekmatyar was in Singapore on an eight-nation tour to seekrecognition for his government. Malaysia announced Tuesday if willformally recognize the interim government.   Mohammad Karim Khalili, spokesman of the Iran-based guerrillas,said at a news conference in Tehran that ``forces in the city ofMeidan, near Kabul, and in Ghazi and areas to the north of thecapital are preparing to start operations, and soon a new frontwill be opened near Kabul,'' Tehran radio reported.   The guerrillas are split into the Iran-based Shiite coalitionand the larger Sunni alliance based in Pakistan. The two have beenat odds over the formation of a guerrilla government, in which theShiite alliance is not represented.   An unidentified official of the Shiite alliance was quoted byIran's official Islamic Republic News Agency as saying that ``plansto attack Kabul have been drawn up and efforts are under way tounite all mujahedeen groups for delivering the coup de grace.''   Pakistan-based guerrilla groups have been engaged in heavyfighting for Jalalabad since March 6.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 19 civiliansdied and 15 were wounded in the latest rebel attack on Jalalabad,45 miles from the border with Pakistan.   ``Government forces counterattacked and forced the opposition tohalt their offensive and retreat,'' he said.   Amani said there were no casualties among government soldiers.He said 271 guerrillas were killed and 201 were injured.   The information could not be independently confirmed.   The guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors,have been fighting nearly 11 years to topple Afghanistan's Marxistgovernment.   Capturing Jalalabad is considered a key element in theirstrategy because it would give the guerrillas their first majorurban foothold.   Amani also said U.N. checkpoints will be set up at six pointsalong the Afghan-Pakistani border to check for aid Afghanistanalleges is flowing to the guerrillas illegally from Pakistan.   Pakistan agreed Tuesday to allow the U.N. to set up permanentmonitoring posts along the border. It denies the Afghan allegations.   The checkpoints will be manned by the U.N. Good Office Missionto Afghanistan and Pakistan, which monitored the withdrawal ofSoviet troops from Afghanistan.   In Iran, Khalili said the Iran-based forces oppose the U.N.deployment.   Rasul Sayyaf, prime minister of the rebels' provisionalgovernment, told U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar onWednesday to stay clear of what he called a dying Kabulgovernment's desperate tactic to draw the Security Council into adomestic war.   In a letter, he asked the U.N. chief to pre-empt a SecurityCouncil debate and if that was not possible, then to ``steer thedebate on the right course _ Russian interference in Afghanistan.''   Afghanistan's ruling Marxists charged in an emergency session ofthe Security Council Tuesday that Pakistan was waging a``full-fledged war'' against Kabul and intervening in the war bysending Pakistani army and milita to the battlefront. Pakistandenied these charges, which have repeatedly been leveled by theKabul government.</TEXT></DOC>
