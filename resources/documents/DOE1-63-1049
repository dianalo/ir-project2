<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-63-1049 </DOCNO><TEXT>Natural gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) has designed and installeda waste heat recovery plant, as a demonstration project, at its compressorstation in Beatrice, Nebraska. A programmable controller and a professionalcomputer comprise the control system for the plant. The plant recoversenergy from the exhaust gas of two four thousand horsepower compressors,and using an expander/compressor turbine, converts thermal to mechanicalenergy to provide additional horsepower for the compression of naturalgas. The experimental nature of the plant, makes it necessary to be ableto change the control sequence and operating parameters easily. Additionally,reliable data acquisition and logging are important considerations. Theprogrammable controller is particularly well suited to this type of application.This paper discusses the operation of the heat recovery plant and designof the hardware and software systems required to control it.</TEXT></DOC>
