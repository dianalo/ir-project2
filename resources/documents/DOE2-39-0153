<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0153 </DOCNO><TEXT>Motivated by a particularly predictive model based on SO(10), we analysesome phenomenological consequences of a sizeable mixing between the tauneutrino and some heavy (mostly right-handed) neutral lepton. In particular,we discuss the impact of such a mixing to the planned experiments ate/sup +/e/sup -/ colliders, reaching the Z/sup 0/-resonance.</TEXT></DOC>
