The initial public response to the widely publicized tiff, which came during a live interview on the Iran-Contra affair Monday night, has been overwhelmingly favorable to the vice president. Mr. Bush seems to have won new political converts among conservatives who dislike the press and voters who previously doubted his mettle.    &quot;I've changed and I'm going with Bush all the way now,&quot; asserted Jacob Sneller, a retired Iowan who earlier leaned toward Sen. Robert Dole. &quot;I think Dan Rather is a jerk.&quot;    Yet if Mr. Bush won the confrontation on style, the substance of what he said may yet come back to haunt him. Amid the on-air fireworks, Mr. Bush didn't fully explain his claims that he didn't know arms were being swapped for hostages after he heard an Israeli official describe the operation in detail. Nor did he completely explain how he failed to hear the protests that top Reagan administration officials voiced at a White House meeting, although President Reagan defended the vice president on the issue yesterday.    Also, some voters are beginning to suspect that Mr. Bush's bluster was a ploy designed to avoid answering tough questions. &quot;It was a cheap shot to put Rather on the spot like that,&quot; said Julianne Austin, a 24-year-old department store saleswoman in New Hampshire, where Mr. Bush leads in the polls. &quot;Bush didn't impress me at all by doing that.&quot;    The vice president's confrontation with Mr. Rather also has raised further questions about the media's performance this political season, as CBS and its affiliates were flooded with phone calls, mostly critical of Mr. Rather. &quot;The press was already being criticized about reporting on candidates' private lives and having TV anchors act as dictatorial schoolteachers in moderating debates,&quot; said Ben H. Bagdikian, dean of the graduate school of journalism at the University of California at Berkeley. &quot;This episode can only add to the public's growing negative image of TV journalism.&quot;    Bush partisans were particularly agitated by their understanding that CBS used a Democratic political operative, Thomas Donilon, who was a top aide to Water Mondale in the former vice president's 1984 presidential campaign, in preparing its report on Mr. Bush's Iran-Contra role. Last night, Mr. Donilon confirmed that he had consulted with Mr. Rather and other CBS officials about the Bush story, saying he was a regular consultant to CBS News: &quot;I talk to CBS regularly on a range of political issues.&quot;    Mr. Rather generally was denounced for his conduct during the interview on CBS Inc.'s regular evening news broadcast. &quot;Dan Rather was out of control,&quot; said Christine Dolan, who directs Cable News Network's political coverage. &quot;He had the right to press the vice president, but he crossed the line with his badgering.&quot;    Mr. Bush angrily maintained during the broadcast that CBS had lured him onto the air under false pretenses by claiming it was airing a general political profile, rather than a segment about the Iran-Contra affair. The letter CBS sent Mr. Bush requesting the interview said that the network was doing a series of candidate profiles, that it had &quot;purposely saved&quot; the Bush profile for last and that Mr. Rather wanted to do the interview himself because &quot;your candidacy deserves special attention.&quot;    But CBS yesterday contended that the network -- not Mr. Bush -- was set up, asserting that the vice president had to have been aware that the interview would focus on his role in the Iran-Contra affair. &quot;This (clash with Mr. Rather) was all contrived for Bush's political purposes,&quot; said Richard Cohen, CBS's senior producer for political coverage. &quot;Bush was trying to beat his Iran-Contra problem and the wimp factor at the same time.&quot;    &quot;Untrue,&quot; responded Craig Fuller, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, although some Bush aides acknowledged privately that they expected Iran-Contra questions to be a dominant feature of the interview. In any event, it was the Bush campaign reaping the benefits of the CBS exclusive. Campaign manager Lee Atwater maintained that his office had to put 15 additional staffers to work Monday night to handle a flood of incoming calls of support.    Mr. Bush also seemed to gain grudging respect among GOP political operatives who have been cool toward him, including some conservatives. &quot;I talked to conservatives all day today, and I think he took a significant step toward the nomination, no question about it,&quot; said Richard Viguerie, a prominent conservative fund-raiser who supports Rep. Jack Kemp of New York. CBS and Mr. Rather are &quot;big bogeymen among conservatives out there,&quot; Mr. Viguerie said.    Philip Jones, vice president and general manager of CBS affiliate KCTV in Kansas City, Mo., said calls to the television station initially were 3-to-1 in favor of Mr. Bush. By late yesterday, however, he said the callers were about even, with nearly half critical of Mr. Bush's failure to answer the questions. &quot;People were saying that the vice president was incorrect for taking offense at the questions,&quot; said Mr. Jones.    One of the questions Mr. Rather posed to Mr. Bush dealt with a meeting that the vice president held in Jerusalem with Amiram Nir, Israel's top counter-terrorism expert, in July 1986. A memo written after the meeting by Bush aide, Mr. Fuller, indicates that the Israeli talked at length about efforts to &quot;gain the release of the U.S. hostages&quot; in Lebanon, and about the steps Israel was taking to facilitate American arms shipments to Iran to &quot;make sure the U.S. will not be involved in logistical aspects.&quot;    Yet Mr. Bush has insisted that he didn't know until the Iran-Contra affair became public six months later that the U.S. was swapping arms for hostages. In explanation, the vice president has sometimes maintained that he wasn't certain what Mr. Nir was talking about. He asserted in the interview with Mr. Rather that Mr. Nir was talking about actions Israel -- not the U.S. -- was taking. Mr. Fuller said yesterday that &quot;with 20/20 hindsight you can read what Nir told us and have a very clear understanding,&quot; but that at the time Mr. Bush and his aides knew so little about operational details of the Iran initiative that it was &quot;unclear&quot; what the Israeli meant.    The other principal question over which Mr. Bush and Mr. Rather quarreled dealt with a White House meeting on the Iran arms sales that the vice president attended on Jan. 7, 1986. Secretary of State George Shultz and then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger have testified that they vigorously protested the arms sales at that session, but Mr. Bush maintained in the CBS interview that he never heard any objections, and added in an aside: &quot;Maybe I wasn't there at that point.&quot;    Administration aides explained yesterday that there were two meetings of top officials that day, and that the objections were voiced at the second meeting, which took place in the Oval Office. Notes and diaries suggest Mr. Bush may have missed the beginning of that session. President Reagan yesterday supported Mr. Bush's argument that he didn't hear the objections. Asked at a White House photo session whether the vice president was present when protests were aired, Mr. Reagan replied: &quot;No, he wasn't.&quot;    The Rather-Bush tiff has attracted so much attention that even CBS's main rivals, ABC and NBC, led their evening TV newscasts with stories about the affair last night.    On CBS last night, Mr. Rather added &quot;a few notes&quot; on the interview, saying that he respects &quot;the office of the vice presidency and the institution of the vice president.&quot; But he added: &quot;Trying to be persistent about answers is part of a reporter's job, and however it may seem at any given time, the intention of even persistent questioning in a spirited interview is to do an honest, honorable job.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;...As Rather May Face Protest From CBS's Affiliate Stations&quot; -- WSJ Jan. 27, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
