(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The piping plovers and roseate terns dueto arrive in nesting areas here in the coming weeks will be met bythousands of gulls, renewing a battle blamed for the decline of theendangered birds off Cape Cod.   Thirty years ago, piping plovers and roseate terns outnumberedthe gulls nesting on Monomoy Island during the spring and summer.   But last year just two pairs of piping plovers and seven pairsof roseate terns nested at the Monomoy wildlife refuge, fightingfor survival against an estimated 70,000 gulls.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which runs Monomoy, thismonth released a new master plan for the refuge that permitspoisoning the gulls to protect the endangered birds.   The gull population explosion has coincided with rampantresidential development on the coast, where garbage in landfillshas given the gulls a new food source.   ``We're giving them a free, hot lunch every day and the ternsand plovers just aren't adaptable enough to take advantage of thatopportunity,'' said Thomas French, director of the state'sendangered species program.   ``They are competing for the same piece of land and the gullsare much more aggressive,'' French said. ``They will eat the ternsfor lunch.''   There will be no poisoning this year because the plan wasreleased too late to conduct the necessary environmental studybefore the migrating shorebirds arrive from winter habitats in theSouth.   But refuge manager Jack Fillio believes the plan will be usednext spring.   ``I'm of the opinion that the gull population has expanded tothe point where this seems to be the most viable technology touse,'' Fillio said in an interview last week. ``You could study theissue until the plovers and terns are gone.''   Animal rights activists have denounced the plan. But state andfederal environmental officials say they reluctantly endorse it asa means of restoring balance to the habitat.   Only one pair of herring gulls was spotted at Monomoy in 1961.More than 15,000 pairs have nested there since 1980. There were noblack-backed gulls nesting at the refuge 25 years ago, but morethan 5,000 pairs have made it their summer home in recent years.   Chris Lahey, conservation director for the Massachusetts AudubonSociety, said provisions in the new master plan endorsing gullpoisoning only as a last resort ``sound like a step in the rightdirection.''   Because poison cannot be used this year, Fillio said refugestaffers will use wire mesh to fence off tern and plover nests anddisrupt gull nests near areas the endangered birds's nests.   Bradford Blodgett, a state ornithologist, said nature may haveprovided an alternative to poison. He said a new barrier islandcreated last year when a winter storm cut through a huge sandbaroff Chatham has created what could be a gull-free home for ternsand plovers.   By breaking up gull nests established on the new island, theterns and plovers could prosper undisturbed if they settle there,Blodgett said.   If the new island helps protect the piping plovers and terns, itwill be the second time in 50 years that nature helped the birds intheir fight against man's influence.   Many species of shorebirds, particularly piping plovers, werehunted almost to extinction in the latter part of the 19th century.Their populations began to recover after passage of the MigratoryBird Treaty Act of 1918, and then rebounded dramatically 20 yearslater when a 1938 hurricane reshaped the land and provided newnesting areas.</TEXT></DOC>
