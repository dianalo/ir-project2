O'Boyle (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ELE PRO </IN><DATELINE> MUNICH, West Germany  </DATELINE><TEXT>   As a physicist, Karlheinz Kaske knows all about inertia -- the tendency of things that are motionless to stay motionless. But understanding inertia and getting rid of it are two different things, as the Siemens AG chairman knows all too well.    In his seven years at the helm of Europe's largest electronics concern, Mr. Kaske, a technical wizard, has tried to work some managerial wizardry at inertia-bound Siemens. He has lectured his troops, telling them that German thoroughness isn't enough any more, that they must foster innovation and be more market driven. He has preached the virtues of less bureaucracy and faster decision-making.    But he has largely failed.    Siemens's continuing inertia comes partly from the company's centralized management style, partly from its culture and partly from Mr. Kaske's own personality. Awakening Siemens has importance far beyond a single company, for Siemens carries the technology banner for West Germany and, to a large extent, for Europe. The dizzying pace of innovation in electronics and the prospect of a truly common European market by 1992 means inertia can no longer be tolerated.    &quot;If Siemens doesn't get going, then the vacuum will be filled by someone else, most likely the Japanese,&quot; says Malcolm Ross, an electronics consultant with Arthur D. Little Inc. in Munich who has worked extensively for Siemens.    Senior management at the electronics giant has long recognized the threat, but appears ready only now to take the big steps necessary to speed the glacial pace of corporate change. Mr. Kaske launched the assault in a July 7 letter to Siemens's top managers outlining what could be the most radical management restructuring in the company's 141-year history.    It would scrap the cumbersome structure that divides Siemens into seven autonomous operating groups and replace it with a flatter organization with significantly more operating groups. As many as seven management levels now separate Mr. Kaske from a plant manager; the new structure would cut that to three or four. Meanwhile, corporate staff functions will be reassigned, as will responsibilities within the 31-man managing board.    &quot;It's a fairly fundamental reshuffling of leadership and it's coming just in the nick of time,&quot; says Mr. Ross. He recalls a presentation he gave to the corporate planning department six years ago. The message: Siemens, with 312 separate businesses, needed to find a focus.    &quot;They all nodded their heads in agreement,&quot; he says. &quot;But you're hard pressed to find evidence of any real change that has occurred there since then.&quot;    Thus, four fields that Siemens long ago singled out for strategic development -- factory automation, office automation, semiconductors and communications -- contributed 65% of Siemens's sales last year, one percentage point less than they did in 1982 despite the fact that these areas have grown phenomenally elsewhere.    Siemens is a competent company. Earnings are likely to recover this year after a 13% decline in 1987. And within Siemens there are some truly successful businesses, such as its medical-equipment group.    But the usual way is to muddle along. &quot;They simply aren't aggressive enough,&quot; says George Verghese, an electronics analyst at the securities research unit of Deutsche Bank AG in London.    That was illustrated four weeks after October's stock market crash, when Siemens cut its dividend 8% despite cash holdings of 23 billion marks ($12.27 billion). With that cash hoard, Siemens could buy all its outstanding shares, even at a significant premium. The 200 Siemens relatives, who own about 10% of the stock, are a bulwark against takeovers with their preferred voting rights that give them a veto at shareholders meetings. The formidable bureaucracy and a work force of 359,000 add to Siemens's elephantine nature.    Siemens was founded in 1847 when Werner von Siemens opened a factory to make an improved telegraph. Over the years a cozy relationship developed between Siemens and its main customer, the Bundespost, Germany's state-run post and telecommunications monopoly. When the Bundespost made procurement decisions, a Siemens representative often sat in the same room. Hans Baur, the Siemens director in charge of telecommunications, still sits on the Bundespost board.    The relationship fostered a sprawling but sleepy civil-service-like company nurtured by the government. Siemens says that atmosphere has changed, but at a plant in southern Germany, one of 172 Siemens factories in 35 countries, it continues to make telephone switching gear that it introduced in 1953, partly to satisfy demand for spare parts.    Even the stodgy Bundespost appears to be changing more rapidly than Siemens. Siemens now supplies 40% of the Bundespost's telephone equipment, instead of its one-time near monopoly.    Some Siemens executives recognize the need for change. The head of corporate planning, Wigand Grosse-Oetringhaus, told a recent Arthur D. Little seminar in Wiesbaden that of Siemens's 312 businesses, it was doing very well in about 50%, so-so in 30% and poorly in 20%.    &quot;He said the company should get out of the businesses where it didn't have market leadership,&quot; says someone who attended the lecture. &quot;It was really radical talk for a Siemens executive.&quot;    In telecommunications, Siemens competes against American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.; in computers, International Business Machines Corp.; in medical equipment and power plants, General Electric Co. of the U.S.; in semiconductors, Japan's Hitachi Ltd.; in light bulbs, N.V. Philips of the Netherlands. Many have a leg up on Siemens because they concentrate on specific technology areas. Over the weekend, Siemens disclosed that it has held exploratory talks with GE on possible cooperative power-generation ventures. They apparently are seeking ways to counter last year's merger of Asea AB of Sweden and Brown, Boveri andamp; Co. of Switzerland into the world's largest power-systems business, Asea Brown Boveri AG.    But bold thinking too often is stifled in Siemens's maze of corporate fiefdoms, where managers often have a tough time making tough decisions. Mr. Kaske's own personality is geared toward reaching consensus. Associates describe the 60-year-old executive as even-tempered, not a tablepounder. While he is a good conceptualizer, they say, he is uncomfortable with conflict and dislikes confrontation. He considers himself an equal among the 30 others on the managing board.    The management reorganization would concentrate more power in the hands of Mr. Kaske and a few trusted associates. &quot;When the dust settles, there will basically be three to five top people running the company and Kaske will be among them,&quot; says a consultant close to Siemens.    For years Mr. Kaske has attacked what he sees as Siemens's chief problem: too much centralization. The company's compartmentalized style also kept research executives miles away from executives in marketing and product development. Now, Siemens has decided the way to get people together is to relocate them.    That is what has happened at the company's computer plant in Augsburg, where Mr. Kaske's vision of the future is taking shape. The plant, besides being Siemens's most highly automated computer manufacturing site, operates under the new management scheme, which gives plant managers responsibility for all aspects of the business they run.    Of the 1,200 employees at Augsburg, 310 work in the product development department, which reports directly to the plant manager. In the past, they were at a different location and reported to company headquarters in nearby Munich.    Siemens is now able to deliver a custom-made computer work station, from order entry to delivery, in 10 days. A year ago, when the computers were made at another site, the process took four weeks.    &quot;We are quicker now but we're still at the starting point,&quot; says Wolfgang Herberich, an assistant to the plant manager. &quot;We haven't yet reached our goals.&quot;    ---              Siemens: Strength and Weakness   Siemens ranked toward the top in research spending per employee ...
