The sample was drawn from 315 randomly selected geographicpoints in the continental United States. Each region of thecountry was represented in proportion to its population.Households were selected by a method that gave all telephonenumbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance of beingincluded. One registered voter, 18 years or older, wasselected from each household by a procedure to provide thecorrect number of male and female respondents. The results ofthe survey were minimally weighted by race and partyidentification to assure that the poll accurately reflectsregistered voters nationwide.</LP><TEXT>   Chances are 19 of 20 that if all registered voters in theU.S. had been surveyed using the same questionnaire, thefindings would differ from these poll results by no more than2.6 percentage points in either direction. The margin oferror for subgroups would be larger.   An additional number of black respondents were alsoincluded. This oversample does not change the results of theoverall survey, but aids in analyzing black voters' views.The margin of error among blacks in this survey is plus orminus 6.7 percentage points.
