LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Riot troops stormed two universitycampuses today to break up rallies supporting a South Korean studentwho defied a ban on travel to communist North Korea.   Also today, 20,000 anti-communist protesters scuffled with policewho blocked their path to the National Assembly.   About 1,500 riot police moved on Konkuk University in easternSeoul after student leaders issued a joint communique with NorthKorean counterparts. Riot police searched school buildings and tookaway about 200 students.   The protest was held to support Im Su-kyong, a Seoul student whowent to North Korea for the 13th World Festival of Youth andStudents. The festival ends Saturday, and the government has saidshe will be arrested and charged with national security violationswhen she returns home.   Student leaders said their communique, announced simultaneouslyin North Korea, urged South and North Korean students to worktogether for national unification and removal of U.S. troops fromthe Korean peninsula.   At nearby Korea University, 1,000 riot police firing tear gascharged the campus and battled several hundred students who ralliedin support of Ms. Im. Protesters armed with firebombs, rocks andclubs drove police back after about 20 minutes of fierce fighting.   About 20,000 riot police sealed off all major universities inSeoul and guarded downtown streets to prevent other rallies. Policestopped pedestrians and cars around campuses for identificationchecks and took away some students.   The Seoul government has accused North Korea of using thefestival to dramatize calls for the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troopsbased in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.   North Korea and dissidents in South Korea contend the U.S. forceshinder unification of the peninsula, which was divided at the end ofWorld War II.   The anti-communist protesters initially pushed their way throughpolice lines to the National Assembly, denouncing an oppositionlawmaker who visited the North. The protesters demanded punishmentof leftists and pro-North Korean dissidents. They also urged theParty for Peace and Democracy, South Korea's largest oppositiongroup, to purge what they called ``pro-communist elements.''   Shouting ``Down with the PPD!'' and ``Destroy communists!'' theprotesters scuffled with riot police who blocked the march in frontof the assembly hall. Many were elderly people who escaped NorthKorea before and during the 1950-53 Korean War.   PPD lawmaker Suh Kyung-won is under arrest after turning himselfin June 25 for traveling to see North Korean leader Kim Il Sung inAugust 1988. Suh was charged with violating national security laws,which carries a maximum penalty of death.   South Korean authorities have arrested eight party members andfriends of Suh who were questioned in the case. South Korea says allcontacts with North Korea must be made only through officialchannels.</TEXT></DOC>
