The detector is transportable,takes data rapidly, and requires only partial removal of the assembliesfrom the storage racks. After describing the detector and the natureof the data taken with it, this report will concentrate on the sensitivityof the detector to missing fuel pins. The interactions between the analysesof the neutron and gamma-ray data place severe restrictions on potentialdiverters. The fork detector essentially forces a potential diverterinto either foregoing a diversion or making a large diversion that couldbe readily detected. A diversion that would escape detection by the forkwould require the removal of a few pins from a large number of assemblies,enhancing the detection probability by other safeguards techniques. 38refs., 34 figs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
