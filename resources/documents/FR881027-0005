It alsochanges the maximum PDR for destinations listed in Supplement No. 3 toPart 773 from 250 million bits per second (with case-by-case approval forindividual requests up to a PDR of 500 million bits per second) to a PDRof 500 million bits per second.Formerly, for destinations in countries not listed in Supplement Nos. 2,3, or 8 to Part 773, the DL authorized shipments of computers having a<T3>floating point</T3> PDR of 20 million bits per second or less. Thisfinal rule establishes a new maximum limit of a <T3>total</T3> PDR of 200 million bits per second for shipments of computersunder the Distribution License to these countries.The new PDR levels are established to maintain consistency with other licensingpolicies and to increase the use of the Distribution License by increasingthe thresholds for computer eligibility consistent with nuclear non-proliferationconcerns and other export control requirements. Moreover, this change isconsistent with the continuing initiative by the Department of Commerceto reform the U.S. export control system and ensure that export licensingrequirements are justified in light of escalating worldwide levels of computertechnology and ever growing foreign availability of computers.Finally, this rule removes the prohibition against exporting electroniccomputers under the Project License procedure to conform with the Officeof Export Licensing's practice of routinely waiving this prohibition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective October 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Eileen Albanese, Special LicensingDivision, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 377-3287.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.2. This rule involves a collection of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These collections have been approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget under Control Numbers 0694-0002, 0694-0006, and 0694-0015.3. This final rule does not contain policies with Federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612.4. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule.5. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is noformal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome ona continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Willard Fisher, Officeof Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Departmentof Commerce, P.O.
