In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the wheatcontract for March delivery rose six cents a bushel to settleat $4.0750. Corn and soybean prices also rose.</LP><TEXT>   With the start of March, an additional $200 million infood-buying loan guarantees were made available to the formerSoviet republics. Armed with the guarantees, thecommonwealth's grain-importing agency reportedly is trying toarrange financing to purchase more than 600,000 metric tonsof subsidized U.S. wheat.   Under a program designed to boost U.S. crop exports, theAgriculture Department compensates grain companies that selldiscount-priced wheat to certain customers such as thecommonwealth.   Grain traders said that the commonwealth is also movingquickly to buy more than 400,000 metric tons of U.S. corn,75,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal and 50,000 metrictons of U.S. soybeans.   The U.S. government is slated to release anotherallocation of loan guarantees to the commonwealth in April.   Prices of crop futures contracts were also supported byreports that a high-ranking official of the Russian republicindicated at a Paris agricultural convention that therepublic possibly needs to import an additional nine millionmetric tons of crops from all sources between now and July.   How much of that business goes to the U.S. might depend onhow the White House responds this month to a visit byofficials of the commonwealth's grain importing agency,Exportkhleb. The officials are expected to pass along aRussian request that the republic independently receive a$600 million package of loan guarantees. The U.S. has beenallocating loan guarantees to the commonwealth, which thenuses them to distribute U.S. crops among the republics.   One consideration for the U.S. government is whether thecommonwealth and its republics can continue to make timelypayments on last year's grain-buying loans. The U.S.government is responsible for some of the loans if thecommonwealth falls behind.   Daniel W. Basse, director of market research at AgResourceCo., Chicago, figures that the commonwealth this month isslated to pay about $124 million -- the largest amount it hashad to pay so far. Since December 1990, the U.S. hasallocated $3.75 billion in loan guarantees for the formerSoviet republics.   Unusually warm weekend weather in the Midwest fannedspeculation about the chances that dry weather might developover the region this summer. Traders are ripe for suchspeculation because an El Nino has formed in the PacificOcean. Such a pocket of warm air and water influences U.S.weather, but traders are divided over whether it signals asummer drought in the Farm Belt.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Gasoline, which has been setting the pace anddirection for petroleum futures prices in recent sessions,fizzled in yesterday's trading on the New York MercantileExchange, bringing other petroleum prices down with it. Mostmarket participants could point to no news events or otherdevelopments to explain the slide and attributed the pricedeclines to technical factors. April gasoline lost 1.08 centsa gallon to settle at 58.75 cents, while April crude oil fell34 cents a barrel to settle at $18.34. April heating oil lostmore ground than crude or gasoline, falling 1.38 cents agallon to settle at 50.20 cents.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures prices fell. Gold for Marchdelivery ended at $351.40 an ounce, down $1.60. The activelytraded April contract finished at $352.50, also $1.60 loweron the day. Analysts attributed the decline to signs thatspeculative demand for gold in India may be reduced ifproposed moves by the Indian government are implemented.Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank,said that the recently submitted Indian budget for 1992-1993calls for liberalizing the rules governing gold imports. Sucha move would likely depress the hefty premium at which goldis sold in India. As a result, Mideast and Asian merchants,who supply the illicit gold pipeline in India, wereliquidating their stocks yesterday. According toKnight-Ridder Financial News, India's plan would allow Indiannationals living or traveling abroad to bring as much as fivekilograms of gold into the country with a duty. &quot;The thingthat depressed the market is that the black market for goldin India would be lessened&quot; as a result of the measuresproposed in the latest budget, said William O'Neill, seniorfutures strategist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. With thesemeasures, the Indian government is trying to &quot;lessen thehistorical activity of smuggling in silver and gold.&quot; Mr.O'Neill said gold also was hurt by Russian and South Africanproducers who were selling in European markets.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices fell on profit-taking. Copper forMarch delivery fell 0.55 cent to $1.024 a pound. The activelytraded May contract finished at $1.024, down 0.80 cent. FredDemler, metals economist at PaineWebber, said that hewouldn't rule out further declines in copper futures. &quot;Rightnow we are still in the correction phase,&quot; said Mr. Demler,adding he thinks the March contract could test the $1.015level or even $1 before climbing again. But Mr. Demler isoptimistic about copper longer term. &quot;General businessconditions are relatively healthy to firm for copper,&quot; Mr.Demler said. Exchange stocks have fallen, consumption issteady and inventories are well-managed, Mr. Demler said.</TEXT></DOC>
