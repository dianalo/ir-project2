(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Christmas star said to have ledthe three wise men to Bethlehem could have been a conjunction ofJupiter, Saturn and Mars, a physicist says.   The three planets were in conjunction _ appearing from Earth tohave merged _ in 6 B.C., about the time of the birth of Christ,said Gary Henson, a physics professor at East Tennessee StateUniversity.   ``The combined light of all three of them would be brighter thanany star,'' Henson said.   Other astronomical phenomenon also have been offered asexplanation for the Christmas story, including a supernova, orexploding star, a comet, or Venus, which can shine very brightly attimes.   One drawback to the conjunction theory, Henson notes, is thatthe wise men were said to be educated in astronomy and should haverecognized the lining up of the three planets or some otherrecurring astronomical event.   ``Even many thousands of years ago, they knew the motions of theplanets,'' Henson said. ``If it was one of those natural objects,they should have been aware of it.''</TEXT><DATELINE>TIGARD, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   His age and size, combined with his ties tothe business community, prove Santa Claus is a Republican, a RotaryClub has determined.   Since they weren't able to check his voter registration,Rotarians in this Portland suburb could only guess Santa'spolitical affiliation. But more than half of the 60 peopleattending Thursday's debate, most of whom were Republicans, decidedto claim the jolly old elf as one of their own.   Tigard city administrator Pat Reilly said Santa, like mostRepublicans, is an older man dedicated to family values.   The fact that St. Nick has lent his jolly image to marketingschemes indicates he's sympathetic to business interests, saidReilly. His concept of merit pay _ gifts only for the nice _ alsofits the Republican image.   But Bill Knudsen, director of Tigard Community Youth Services,disagreed.   If Santa were a true Republican, Knudsen said, he'd live inbalmy Palm Beach instead of the North Pole.   An then there's that long, white beard.   ``I mean, maybe he'd have a pencil-thin mustache, but everyoneknows it's illegal in America for a Republican to wear a beard,''Knudsen said.</TEXT><DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Giving your true love all the giftsmentioned in ``The 12 Days of Christmas'' would cost $8,401 thisyear.   That's the estimate of Texas Comptroller Bob Bullock, who notesstate and local sales tax would have to be added in many areas.   Here's the rundown, at Texas prices:   _ A partridge, $40.   _ Two turtle doves, $25.   _ Three French hens, $18.   _ Four calling birds, $250.   _ Five golden rings, $648.   _ Six geese-a-laying $90.   _ Seven swans a-swimming, $7,000.   _ Eight maids a-milking, at a salary of $200 a day.   _ A pair of ballet tickets to see nine ladies dancing and 10lords leaping, $50.   _ Eleven pipers piping and 12 drummers drumming could be had fortwo $40 symphony tickets.   If it all seems a bit much, there's always a card, about $1.50.</TEXT><DATELINE>SANTA CLAUS, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Visitors who drive hundreds of miles tosee the tiny town named after St. Nick are greeted by a sorry Santawho slumps and groans.   Some residents say the condition of the 30-foot fiberglass Santaon the edge of town is embarassing. Others say it's downrightdangerous.   ``People stop there all the time to sit their kids on his bootsand snap pictures,'' said Marlin Rook. ``Wouldn't it be tragic ifsomeone was standing there and Santa Claus fell on them?''   Santa is slumped forward on crumpled boots, with only a steelcable to support his weight. When the winter wind whistles by, thenot-so-jolly old elf rocks and moans.   The statue beside Highway 245 is the most prominent of two SantaClauses still standing of four the Chamber of Commerce erected in1981. One was blown over and another, located near a high school,had to be removed after students covered it with graffiti.   Last year, Mrs. Rook and resident Cammie Pruss repainted thestatue. But in July, Santa began to slump forward. Since then, he'ssteadily gotten worse.   Now a property is considering loaning money for some of theneeded repairs, estimated at from $2,500 to $3,000.   ``A lot of people who live here have lived here all their livesand they don't realize how neat it is,'' said Mrs. Pruss, who isfrom Pittsburgh. ``You don't see these statues of Santa Clausstanding around everywhere.''</TEXT></DOC>
