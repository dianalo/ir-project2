Investors have continuedto pour money into stock and bond mutual funds despiterecently shaky securities prices, and the industry's assetsare now at an all-time high.   But the champagne is unlikely to flow this week when 1,200fund-industry executives gather in Washington, D.C., fortheir annual shindig, the Investment Company Institutegeneral membership meeting.</LP><TEXT>   For although fund shareholders have remained tenacious intheir investing, it seems fund executives have been even morebullish -- and now are starting to pay for their excesses.   The problem is simple enough: The fund industry isbringing out new funds faster than money is rolling in. That,plus the recent slump in stock and bond prices, has meantdeclining assets per mutual fund and hence lower profits forthe industry.   Today, the average bond and income fund is 8% smaller thanit was at the end of 1985, and the average stock fund is only11% larger. Money-market funds have made healthy gains inassets, but these funds often aren't as profitable for thefund-management companies.   &quot;In 1987 and 1988, we continued to see the introduction ofnew funds,&quot; and they attracted healthy dollops of assets,says Edward Mahoney, president of AMEV Advisers. &quot;In 1989, westill saw new funds, but they didn't get the assets that theyexpected.&quot;   Launching new funds is proving harder than ever, forcingfund executives to advertise heavily, cut prices and mergeuneconomical funds. Once the dust settles, the big loser maywell turn out to be smaller fund groups that cannot afford tocompete. Fund investors stand to be the big winners,benefiting from lower expense ratios and lower mutual fundsales commissions.   The motto among some large fund groups seems to be: Grabassets at almost any price. In the no-load fund arena, themost visible combatants are Dreyfus Corp. and FidelityInvestments, which have been temporarily absorbing expenseson some funds in an effort to get greater market share.   After butting heads last year over money-market funds,Dreyfus and Fidelity are at it once again, this time withfunds that seek to track the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stockmarket index. Dreyfus's Peoples Index Fund is absorbing allexpenses for the moment, while Fidelity's Spartan MarketIndex Fund is holding down its expenses to 0.28% of assetsannually.   Dreyfus has promised to absorb expenses until year end oruntil the fund hits $100 million in assets, whichever comesfirst. Fidelity says it will hold down expenses through May1991.   One potential loser in this price-cutting war is VanguardGroup, which has long relied on its low expense ratios as itsprincipal marketing tool. &quot;On the money-market side, it'sclear they have slowed our perennial gains in market share,&quot;says Vanguard Chairman John Bogle. He recently made amuch-publicized complaint to the Securities and ExchangeCommission, arguing that the 12-month yields being advertisedon some money funds were artificially high because expenseswere being absorbed and could be imposed at any time.   As no-load funds absorb expenses to pump up returns,broker-sold funds have been cutting commissions to pull innew customers, and today few funds still charge the maximum8.5% sales commission. Over the past year, large fund groupssuch as American Funds Group, Putnam Financial Services andPrimerica Corp.'s majority-owned subsidiary, American CapitalManagement andamp; Research Inc. have cut the loads on their equityfunds to 5.75%, at the same time introducing an annual &quot;12b1&quot;marketing fee of 0.25%.   The fight for assets is starting to punish profits. T.Rowe Price Associates Inc., Colonial Group Inc. and AmericanCapital all reported stagnant earnings for the most recentquarter compared with a year earlier, and Dreyfus's earningswere down slightly.   While price-cutting and ballooning advertising costs havehurt profits at some large fund groups, they have also helpedthese companies nab greater market share. According to arecent research report from Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., the10 largest independent fund groups now manage 38% of theindustry's assets, up from 35% four years ago. The reportpredicts that the market share of these 10 fund groups couldbe as high as 45% by 1994.   Some smaller players are finding they just can't afford tocompete. After 13 years of managing mutual funds, Bull andamp; BearGroup Inc. put its fund business up for sale this pastJanuary. &quot;The giants of the business provide seriouscompetition, and we decided that we weren't well enoughcapitalized to compete,&quot; says Chairman Bassett Winmill. Thefund group has received 280 inquiries from groups interestedin buying the $345 million, 10-fund family.   Ivy Group has talked to some would-be suitors, thoughChairman Michael Peers says the firm has never activelylooked for a merger partner. Still, Ivy has clearly hadtrouble pulling in new assets. In February, it closed downits government bond fund, which had just $2 million inassets. &quot;It just hadn't taken off,&quot; says Mr. Peers. &quot;We setit up three years ago, and it just didn't go anywhere.&quot;   Ivy's four remaining no-load funds -- three stock fundsand a money-market -- have fared only slightly better,pulling in just $293 million despite producing excellentreturns for investors. &quot;It could be competition, or it couldbe that we're just not great marketers,&quot; says Mr. Peers. &quot;Ilook at these fund groups with records much poorer than ours,and they're the ones pulling in the money.&quot;   Because the mutual fund industry has historically enjoyedsuch fat profit margins, the recent step-up in competition isunlikely to force many fund groups to abandon the industryaltogether. &quot;At the time of the '87 crash, mutual fund salesdropped off and a lot of people were calling for massconsolidation,&quot; recalls one analyst. &quot;But even some of thesmall mutual fund companies are still doing relatively well.The margins are still pretty generous.&quot;   Instead, analysts predict that fund groups will streamlineby merging small, unprofitable funds into larger, moreeconomical units or scrapping small funds altogether.National Securities andamp; Research Corp. now is shrinking to 13funds from 16, American Capital is in the process of mergingfour funds and Boston Co. recently abandoned a yearlongeffort to sell four index funds.   Fund mergers have an added advantage: They often provide away of burying pitiful performance records. At the end ofMarch, American Capital merged $39 million American CapitalOver-The-Counter Securities into $198 million AmericanCapital Venture. American Capital Venture had returned 49%over the preceding five years; American Capital OTC hadreturned just 5%.   Expunging a bad record &quot;is not the motivation for thisparticular merger,&quot; says Don Powell, American Capital'schairman. &quot;We're merging smaller, high-expense-ratio fundsinto larger funds.&quot;   He adds, &quot;I think {mergers} are a plus for shareholders.They generally result in higher yields and lower expenseratios.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
