CHELLGREN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lawmakers in Kentucky, the nation's leadingtobacco producer, are pressuring the University of Louisville todrop its plan to restrict smoking, days after a government reportshowed the state had the nation's highest smoking-related death rate.   The chairman of the state House agriculture committee said Mondaythat the controversy over designated non-smoking areas at theuniversity is about economics and individual rights, not abouthealth.   But supporters of segregating smokers said that health is theoverriding concern and that they are not enemies of the tobaccoindustry in a state where it accounts for an estimated 54,000 jobsand where burley tobacco is the No. 1 cash crop with $451 million insales last year.   The dispute grew out of the university's consideration of apolicy to ban smoking in classrooms, reception areas and elevatorsand to permit smoking only in designated areas of most otherbuildings.   Members of the General Assembly's Tobacco Task Force reacted bythreatening to cut the university's budget.   ``I don't think we're fighting for the tobacco industry, or thetobacco farmer. We're talking about people's rights here,'' saidRep. Clay Crupper, chairman of the Agriculture and Natural ResourcesCommittee.   Crupper said it sends a bad signal to the rest of the countrywhen Kentucky joins the list of places where tobacco is under attack.   At a meeting in Owensboro late Sunday, Crupper first called onthe task-force members to approve a resolution asking the universityto back down. But he later agreed to give the university until thetask force's Dec. 5 meeting to revise its policy.   A newly released report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Controlshows Kentucky with the nation's highest smoking-related death rate.   Kentucky reported 176 smoking-related deaths for every 100,000residents in 1985, the agency reported Thursday. Nationwide, smokingkilled 314,574 Americans that year.   Agriculture Commissioner Ward ``Butch'' Burnette, a smoker andpromoter of the tobacco industry, said the state university'sproposed smoking policy was a slap at the farmers and companies thatpay taxes on their tobacco business.   ``I personally believe that since we are such a large tobaccostate, it is a mistake for a school like U of L to do that becauseso many of their tax dollars come from it,'' Burnette said.   Dan Hall, special assistant to Louisville's president, said theschool expected some backlash when it began considering the policy,but is trying to balance health concerns and individual rights.   ``Given the history and the fact that tobacco has played animportant role in the history of the commonwealth, we expected therewould be some reaction to it,'' Hall said.   ``This is not an anti-smoking policy. This is not an anti-tobaccopolicy.'' Hall said.</TEXT></DOC>
