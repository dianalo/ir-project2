The State Department said it continues to recognize Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle as the constitutional leader of Panama, thus giving banks legal grounds to heed his request that they hold on to Panamanian assets in the U.S. The department also indicated it would heed Mr. Delvalle's request that the U.S. effectively withhold some $7 million in monthly payments for the Panama Canal.    Gen. Noriega had President Delvalle ousted after the Panamanian president tried last week to dismiss him as military leader.    Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of four U.S. senators will introduce legislation today to impose a total trade embargo on Panama. The lawmakers include Sens. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.), Jesse Helms (R., N.C.), Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and John Kerry (D., Mass.).    The freezing of assets is just one part of a multifaceted economic warfare strategy against Gen. Noriega devised in Washington by supporters of President Delvalle with the advice of William Rogers, a former U.S. government official and Washington lawyer.    &quot;We are imposing as tight a freeze on transfers to the Noriega regime by the financial system of the United States as we know how to do,&quot; said Mr. Rogers, a member of the law firm Arnold andamp; Porter. &quot;And we are throwing a net, as wide as we know how to throw it, and we hope to catch every fish in the sea.&quot;    Backers of Mr. Delvalle, asserting they represented the Republic of Panama, yesterday managed to have the Republic National Bank of New York transfer $10 million in Panamanian funds to an account under their control at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. They had filed suit seeking that the bank be enjoined from transferring to the control of the Noriega regime any funds or other property belonging to Panama. The suit was dropped after the money was transferred.    However, Delvalle's forces late yesterday extended their legal action to include Marine Midland Bank, Bankers Trust Co., and Irving Trust Co. The suits seeks to make the banks liable for any funds transferred to the control of the Noriega regime after Feb. 26, the day after President Delvalle announced the dismissal of Gen. Noriega.    John Petty, chairman of Marine Midland Bank, had no comment on the suit, saying he was &quot;trying to sort it out.&quot; Spokesmen at both Bankers Trust and Irving Trust said they had no comment.    U.S. District Judge Lloyd MacManon in New York will decide today whether to grant the anti-Noriega group's request for a temporary restraining order enjoining any debits against any accounts of the Republic of Panama without the approval of Juan Sosa, Panama's ambassador to the U.S. The judge granted just such a restraining order in the Republic National Bank case.    Meanwhile, the U.S. has taken action that will withhold from Gen. Noriega at least part of the more than $80 million the U.S. owes the Panamanian government each year for use of the Panama Canal. Currently, the payments are made in monthly installments of $7 million. But at the request of President Delvalle, the U.S. said it will stop making monthly payments, the next of which is due March 15, and instead pay the entire annual amount later in the year.    While this would deny Gen. Noriega's regime cash it dearly needs now, an administration official said that it still would meet the U.S.'s legal requirements under the Panama Canal Treaty.    U.S. officials say the actions against Gen. Noriega here come atop mounting economic difficulties for him at home. They hope the increasing economic pressure will prompt fellow Panamanian military officers to oust Gen. Noriega.    A Reagan administration official said a general strike in Panama, which started slowly earlier this week, now has shut down more than 75% of the country's businesses. He said all Panamanian banks have been closed since Monday, when there was a run on their funds. Gen. Noriega has ordered the banks to reopen on Friday, but they will only do so with limited staff so as to avoid another run, the administration official said. </TEXT></DOC>
