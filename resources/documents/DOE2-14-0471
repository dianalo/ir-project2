Using in vitro vertebral quantitative CT and chemical analysis,the authors evaluated data from several centers to compare fat-inducederrors with the remaining error sources for the technique. Followinglaw of error propagation, the fat-related error and the remaining errorsources add quadratically to yield the total accuracy error. For example,with the General Electric CT/T 9800 scanner a fat-related error of 6.9mg/ml contributes to only 14% to the total SEE of 13.7 mg/ml for single-energyquantitative CT, versus mineral content data. The remaining 11.8 mg/mlresults from other error sources. The authors compared these findingswith data obtained on other scanners. Analyzing normative fat versusage and mineral versus age data, they found that with the GE CT/T 9800scanner, fat variability contributes only about 3% to a total SEE of25 mg/ml for single-energy quantitative CT, versus age. Implicationsfor the diagnostic validity of this method in individual patients aregiven.</TEXT></DOC>
