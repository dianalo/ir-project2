The bill, co-sponsored Thursday by Reps. Al Swift, D-Wash., andTom Tauke, R-Iowa, would lift some restraints that were imposed onthe companies when the Bell System was broken up by a federalconsent decree in 1984.   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., introduced a non-binding resolutionin the House last year that called for allowing the Baby Bells backinto manufacturing and information services, and it had 205co-sponsors.   The Bell companies claim federal regulation is limiting U.S.telecommunications competitiveness overseas and is deprivingconsumers of the latest in communications advances.   ``Other countries are racing ahead with telecommunicationsresearch and development, but we stand with our hands tied behindour back,'' Tauke said in a statement.   Pacific Telesis Group Chairman Sam Ginn called the bill a``milestone in the history of telecommunications policy'' andcommended Congress ``for taking this first step toward bringingU.S. consumers and businesses time-saving conveniences andcompetitive tools that other countries now enjoy.''   Nynex Corp. said lifting the restrictions was ``essential to theenhancement of competition in both domestic and global markets.''   Ameritech Chairman William L. Weiss said it was ``a criticallyimportant step forward.''   BellSouth Corp. also hailed the bill, but said it also imposesrestrictions ``that will further delay the wide availability ofinformation services, including the provision of electronicpublishing.''   Jerry W. Friedheim, president of the American NewspaperPublishers Association, which would face heavy competition inelectronic classified ads, said the bill ``would result in less _not more _ information being provided to American homeselectronically.''   The Swift-Tauke measure includes provisions designed to protectconsumers, and orders the FCC to assure compliance.   The Bell companies must provide other information serviceproviders with non-discriminatory access to their phone lines.   The FCC must determine that a Bell company does not holdmonopoly power over electronic publishing services such aselectronic yellow pages or telephone exchange service in its area.It also limits revisions to the yellow pages to once a month forthe first two years.   The Bell companies could provide electronic publishing outsidetheir service areas without restriction.   The bill would supersede U.S. District Judge Harold Greene'soversight of the Bell companies, said Ed Senn, an aide to Tauke.   It would not apply to American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., norwould it repeal restrictions on telephone companies from providingcable TV programming, Senn said.   ATandamp;T has opposed the regional Bell companies' entry intolong-distance and manufacturing as long as they retain control overlocal phone networks. ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said ATandamp;T didn'tthink the bill was necessary because the consent decree was working.   Linnen said it was ``startling'' that one part of the bill``appears to exempt the telephone companies from antitrust law withrespect to some of the activities they want to enter.''   ``The bill's attempts to prescribe certain safeguards againstabuse in manufacturing and information services strike us asfutile, given the bill's other provisions that would removeantitrust protections,'' Linnen said.   The bill also requires the Bell companies to providenon-discriminatory procurement in the manufacture of telephoneequipment, and bars the phone companies from using proceeds fromregulated telephone service to subsidize information services ormanufacturing, and vice versa.   The FCC also must assure that telephone customers do not pay forfailed information services or manufacturing ventures and thatinvestment costs cannot be assigned to phone customers unless thecustomers will benefit.   The bill also requires the FCC to regulate any transfer ofassets between enterprises or credit arrangements.   The bill calls for unspecified penalties and fines forviolations.</TEXT></DOC>
