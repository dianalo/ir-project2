Construction of thepowerline began in 1983, and the powerline was energized in 1985. TheGarrison-Taft powerline corridor crossed 251 km of mountainous terrainin western Montana; about 465 km of new roads were constructed to providepermanent access to the powerline towers. The objectives of the studywere: (1) to monitor the effectiveness of mitigation measures, includingtiming restrictions on construction activities and road closures on newly-builtaccess roads, and (2) to determine if opening previously-unroaded elksecurity habitats to hunters by powerline access roads affected elk habitatuse, distribution, use of security areas, or elk harvest. In addition,both the potential for accelerated timber harvest in areas crossed bythe powerline that would not have otherwise been logged because of marginaleconomics and lack of haul roads and the potential effect of powerlineflashovers on future prescribed burning of elk winter-ranges were evaluated.83 refs., 88 figs., 15 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
