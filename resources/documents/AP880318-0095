Carlucci said todaythat U.S. soldiers will conduct exercises in Honduras for about 10days and reiterated that there are no plans for them to engage incombat.   A Pentagon spokeswoman, Capt. Nancy LaLuntas, said that 1,062troops were on the ground in Honduras Thursday night and that all3,126 were expected to be in place by tonight. Carlucci said onABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' that only 300 had arrived inHonduras, but the spokeswoman said that figure was wrong.   Troops being flown to Honduras included the 82nd Airborne fromFort Bragg, N.C., and the 7th Light Infantry Division, based atFort Ord, Calif.   ``The plan is for the exercise to last approximately 10 days,''Carlucci told ABC.   ``There are no plans for these troops to engage in combat, andwe never comment on contingency plans, of course,'' he said.   Fighting continues between Nicaraguan government forces and theContra rebels, with the U.S.-backed rebels forced to pull back fromsome of their positions, Carlucci said.   ``We don't have an accurate count of casualties, but people arebeing wounded and killed,'' he said.   Carlucci said it was also difficult to tell how many Sandinistatroops had crossed the Honduran border because the incursion wastaking place in a remote area. He said 1,500 to 2,000 Sandinistatroops have been amassed in the border area since March 1.   Asked if there had been any significant victories or defeats inthe fighting, Carlucci said, ``No, I wouldn't characterize it inthose terms, although the freedom fighters have had to fall back abit. They've had to abandon some of their positions and move toother positions.''   He said there were no plans to move any other U.S. land, sea orair forces into the area.   Carlucci said he was confident the Honduran troops would ``takewhatever measures they consider appropriate to defend themselves.We stand by to be helpful and we are showing our moral supportthrough the exercise.''
