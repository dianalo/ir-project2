In 115 patients (31%) such lesions could be demonstrated. Computedtomography of the liver was performed in 52 of these patients, a longterm sonographic follow-up in 76, and a biopsy in 3 cases. In 103 patientsthe hypoechoic lesions were due to sonographic pseudolesions (PL's),probably representing normal liver tissue in otherwise diffusely fattyinfiltrated livers. The PL's showed characteristic sonographic appearancessuch as a missing mass effect, a 'landscape'-like configuration withangulated margins and slender extensions of hypoechoic tissue. The PL'swere located below the capsule, near the gallbladder (41%), and ventralto the portal vein (37%). In 75 per cent they occurred in a liver withconsiderably increased echogenicity. In 12 patients hypoechoic lesionswere caused by circumscribed malignant or infectious involvement of theliver. They could be discriminated from PL's by their mass-like appearancein 8 subjects. In 4 of these 12 cases the foci were of PL-typical appearance,but not of PL-typical location. In the light of these results and ofrecently published reports a rational diagnostic approach to hypoechoiclesions without halo in echogenic livers varies, depending on such factorsas known primary malignancy or site of the lesion.</TEXT></DOC>
