 No longer are theprime agency databases on inaccessible mainframes -- often a mini or a microis the database server.andM;Unfortunately, access to these databases is frequently difficult for theuninitiated.andP;  An attempt to fill this void comes from the vendors of reportwriters and in the UNIX market, one such product that is easy to use andpowerful is Intelligent Query from Programmed Intelligence.andM;A consistent interface and clear English-like commands make IntelligentQuery's proprietary, non-procedural language easier to learn and use thanStructured Query Language.andM;The basic operating interface revolves around the pop-up window.andP;  Mostwindows list a series of choices, which when selected pop up another window.andO;For example, when building a query, the bottom portion of the screen holdsthe query while the top consists of a series of overlapping windows.andM;Once you are working in a window, move the cursor to the desired choice andpress Enter.andP;  The interface is so easy to use that the average user willseldom resort to the pages of the manual after a couple of hours.andM;The user's first task is to pick a database to use from the list of availableones.andP;  IQ will provide a complete list of all tables for which a datadictionary has been created.andP;  Once selected the process of building the queryreport begins.andM;Once a database table is opened, a group of records need to be selected.andP;  Thepoint-and-pick menu makes for easy record selection.andP;  You select a field anduse the pop-up menu to select an operator.andP;  Available operators fall into twocategories: comparative ones such as LESS THAN and EQUALS and string orcharacter ones such as contains.andP;  All the operators can be mixed and matchedwith AND/OR conjunctions.andP;  For example, you can select all widgets whoseprice is greater than $10 AND whose manufacturing elements field containslead.andM;Output ChoicesandM;Because IQ is more than a query writer, the choice of output is broad.andP;  For asimple query, you choose the Display Mode.andP;  After choosing the output mode, awindow of all available fields displays for inclusion inthe query.andP;  Using thecursor and Enter key, you highlight the fields selected for the query.andM;If a printed result is necessary but formatting is extraneous, then selectPrint Mode rather than Display.andP;  Control over the format, similar to theDisplay Mode, is limited.andP;  Both of these choices are quick and dirty,allowing hassle-free results.andP;  Even the most naive user can produce a printedquery in this fashion.andM;A highly polished report requires the user to choose Report Output.andP;  As isthe case with the other output options, you must first choose the criteriafor record selection.andM;In the Report Mode, a full page editing screen handles input with the reportdivided into headings, body and subtotals.andP;  Each of these areas can betailored to the needs of the report.andM;Report a la ModeandM;The heading section contains titles, column headings, dates, top of pageinformation and so on.andP;  While far from a good text editor, the Report Modedoes allow for lineandM;deletion and insertion, and centering.andP;   FieldsandM;can go in the heading when appropriate.andM;Actual output fields show up in the body of the report in whatever orderdesired.andP;  You can suppress sorted fields until the sort field changes value.andO;This is something the Query Mode does not allow.andP;  You can produce up to a250-column report.andM;Subtotals of selected fields can reprot out and go under the fields.andP;  Totalsof subtotals are also possible.andP;  When complete, you return to the menu forfurther action.andP;  Normally, this is when you choose the fields to sort.andO;Prudent planning dictates that the layout of the report be built with thesorted fields in mind.andM;Once you choose a set of records and identify report fields, the next logicalstep is to sort them.andP;  Again, a pop-up window allows you to identify thefields to sort.andP;  There are, however, two areas where the sorting procedurefor queries is short of the best.andM;The printed order of sorted fields does not change, whereas many products putthe sorted fields at the far left.andP;  Also, a sorted field is listed for everyentry and not just once for a category.andP;  This makes a query more difficult toread, especially when dealing with many repeated fields.andP;  The report writerhandles both of these problems.andM;You can use Command Line Mode, but there is seldom any need to use it.andP;  Theonly commands not directly supported in the pick-and-point frames are &quot;if&quot;statements.andP;  The only other reason to use the Command Line Mode relates tobuilding involved record selections that require more than two levels ofrecord selectors.andM;Experience suggests that few queries fall into these groups for the averageuser -- the very market for IQ.andM;Execution of the report or query always provides a screen preview option.andP;  Ifthe report looks good, then proceed to print, otherwise you can return to theReport Mode and make further modifications.andP;  You also can save reports orqueries to disk in several different formats.andM;Programmed Intelligence put a basic graphics ability into IQ, but it isextremely limited.andP;  If you can tolerate the choice between an XY graph and anon-flexible bar histogram, then these options may help out.andM;For most users, the lack of formatting, graph-type options or user controlwill make graphing a last resort.andP;  It is much easier to dump a report to diskand load it into a good graphics package such as SCO ImageBuilder from theSanta Cruz Operation Inc. in Santa Cruz, Calif., or a DOS package.andM;The documentation is average, but most uses will never have to consult it.andO;The point-and-pick menus are clear.andP;  Errors are difficult to make, and a helpscreen can pop up at nearly every level.andM;A good on-line tutorial accompanies IQ.andP;  It consists of a 50-record payrolldatabase.andM;Easy to UseandM;You can follow the lead of the book, or better yet, just go into the tutorialand run with it by building some reports.andM;The only reason to buy a report writer is because it is easier to use thanthe original database management system query and report generators.andP;  In thecase of IQ, it passes with flying colors.andP;  In almost every environment,Intelligent Query is many times easier to use and just as fast for standardinquiries.andM;I tested IQ against a database in Informix from Informix Software Inc. inLenexa, Kan., using a 16-MHz 80386 from Zeos International Ltd., in St. Paul,Minn.andP;  The operating system was SCO Xenix 386.andP;  IQ-built queries were just asfast as Informix SQL ones and many times easier to build.andM;This simplicity, of course, has its downside.andP;  The user trades power for easeof use.andP;  But then, that is the idea behind IQ.andM;Pricing varies dependent on the type of computer but ranges from $1,500 to$17,500.andP;  Support is free for 30 days.andM;Michael J.
