Lung cancer was found in 16% of reported silicosispatients, in 81% it was simple silicosis, in 50% of cases in was an epidermoidtype of cancer. In two cases the malignant process originated in thesilicotic node, in one case from a tuberculoma. Lung cancer occurredmost frequently in the right lower lung region. The mean age of the silicosisgroup was 48.6 years and 56.0 years for the lung cancer group. No differencewas thus seen from the mean age of patients with lung cancer from radioactivecompounds diagnosed in the years 1976 to 1980 but it was significantlylower that the reported average age of patients with coincidence of lungcancer and pneumoconiosis in the population not exposed to ionizing radiation.(author). 2 figs., 1 tab., 18 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
