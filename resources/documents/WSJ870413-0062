TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMT </IN><DATELINE> NYACK, N.Y.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   &quot;How do you keep the flame alive?&quot; asks Interior Secretary Donald Hodel. &quot;I say it is time for us to be bold.&quot;    Mr. Hodel flew here Saturday to urge a New York state Conservative Party convention &quot;to make sure that Ronald Reagan's principles are carried forward.&quot;    The former Oregon precinct organizer, state chairman and draft-Reagan-for-president worker says he can feel the energy ebbing from the Reagan administration's political boiler. &quot;You have to wonder how much go power you've got&quot; at this point in the administration, Mr. Hodel concedes. He worries that in 1988, the Republican Party will fudge its commitment to conservative principles.    &quot;I believe there will be a great effort, and it is going on now in my estimation, to convince the American people that they are not conservative,&quot; he explains in an interview. &quot;And I don't want to see the Republican Party or the nation fall prey to that.&quot;    So the 51-year-old Mr. Hodel has taken on the self-appointed role of Keeper of the Flame. This has sparked speculation that he hopes to ignite a political future for himself. Members of his staff have whispered the words vice president, and he sounds interested in being party chairman. But most political professionals scoff at such hopes. &quot;It's highly unlikely that somebody is going to get on the ticket that's never been elected to public office,&quot; says Robert Teeter, a GOP pollster.    Mr. Hodel generally gets high marks for his two-year tenure as Energy secretary. And even critics credit his openness and caution at the Interior Department with calming the backlash stirred up by his predecessor and one-time boss, James Watt. But critics say he lacks major accomplishments and has made slim progress in a polarized atmosphere toward reestablishing the mineral-leasing programs that Congress sharply restricted in reaction to Mr. Watt.    Mr. Hodel isn't widely known outside of Washington. But over the past six months or so he has been increasingly visible, visiting newspapers, talking to political reporters and speaking out on subjects as far afield from his department as support for anti-communist guerrillas around the world.    In recent weeks he has hosted the Republican National Committee and worked the party's conservative wing. In February he spoke to the Citizens for the Republic, in March to the National Conservative Political Action Committee. Last year he was the commencement speaker at Jerry Falwell's Liberty University.    Mr. Hodel's message is tailored to the latest conservative style: Don't negotiate away the Strategic Defense Initiative, try to turn back the &quot;Soviet-Marxist-Leninist domination&quot; of the Soviet Union's satellite countries, balance the budget without new taxes, elevate religious and family values, and let states block abortion and permit school prayer.    He warns the Conservative Party here that Democratic lawmakers are &quot;attempting to bring down the presidency&quot; by prolonging the Iran-Contra scandal. And he urges liberal use of Mr. Reagan's veto to curb growth of &quot;misshapen, bloated government.&quot;    The Interior secretary has been the administration's leading advocate of strong action to curb the growing U.S. reliance on oil imports.    At times he seems shrill and divisive. He aroused an angry backlash in Canada when he suggested that Canada is demanding strong U.S. acid-rain controls to improve its own energy exports to the U.S. His wide-ranging comments on energy policies have irritated Energy Secretary John Herrington, who has publicly disagreed with Mr. Hodel's predictions of gasoline shortages and gas-station lines in two to five years. But Mr. Hodel hasn't pulled back. &quot;I can go a long way before I will be reined in,&quot; he says.    He has dropped the conciliatory theme that he voiced when he became Interior secretary Feb. 7, 1985. An early attempt at conciliation, with environmentalists who had revolted against Mr. Watt's unrestrained pro-development bent, backfired.    In summer 1985, Mr. Hodel entered into a &quot;preliminary agreement&quot; with California coastal congressmen, all opponents of offshore oil development, to limit leasing on the continental shelf where Congress had forbidden drilling. But the oil industry was outraged and told Mr. Hodel's staff that the 150 tracts the agreement would open for leasing were almost worthless. Mr. Hodel backpedaled, ruling out sensitive areas like the Big Sur coastline in a vain hope that Californians would clear leasing on more tracts. Finally, Mr. Hodel rejected the deal.    Some environmental-group leaders have never trusted him again. Even the most moderate of the groups, the National Wildlife Federation, has stopped talking to him and has stepped up its lawsuits against the Interior Department to a record high. Mr. Hodel is &quot;a nice person,&quot; says Jay Hair, the federation's executive director, but his conciliatory talk is &quot;just a fluff and puff show. Whenever there is a question between conservation and exploitation, he always comes down&quot; favoring the exploitation side.    More important to Reaganites, Mr. Hodel also lost the confidence of some oilmen who helped form the heart of President Reagan's natural constituency. Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, still complains that Mr. Hodel closed off lands to the industry.    Mr. Hodel's positions gradually have hardened. He is moving toward an offshore development plan that eliminates some promises to close off sensitive areas until the year 2000. He also is expected to propose full exploration and development of part of a wildlife refuge in Alaska that has great oil and gas promise.    He says he is determined not to make &quot;the error of trying to compromise with somebody who has taken a no-compromise position.&quot; More broadly, he tells conservatives, &quot;It is better to stand and fail on some issues than to compromise and look wishy-washy.&quot;    Rep. Leon Panetta, Democratic leader of California's congressional drilling opponents, faults Mr. Hodel for failing to build a consensus for an offshore oil policy or a national energy policy. Mr. Hodel's speeches &quot;feed the suspicion that he's not interested in getting something done on Capitol Hill but in developing a public relations image,&quot; Rep. Panetta says.    New York Conservative Party Chairman Serphin Maltese greets Mr. Hodel here as &quot;a leader in the next wave of the Reagan revolution.&quot; But Mr. Hodel insists he is speaking to influence the Republican Party and the nation, rather than to pave the way for a political candidacy. &quot;My plans,&quot; he says, &quot;are no more fixed than to go back to the West.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
