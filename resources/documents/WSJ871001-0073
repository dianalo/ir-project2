The bill, approved 14-6, would close the so-called 13D window that allows an investor acquiring more than 5% of a company's stock to wait 10 days before disclosing that fact to the Securities and Exchange Commission.    The amended bill would prohibit an acquirer crossing the 5% threshold from making any additional purchases of the stock of the company in question until disclosure of that holding had been made to the SEC. In addition, the acquirer would be required to make the disclosure within five days, instead of the 10 currently allowed.    The committee deleted from the bill sections that would have inhibited the use of so-called poison-pill takeover defenses, as well as a proposed limitation of &quot;golden parachute&quot; payouts for management ousted by takeovers.    The committee also approved an amendment that would allow holders of more than 10% of a concern's stock to have their own proxy solicitation materials included with the company's mailings to shareholders, rather than having to make their own mailing.    The amended bill also would require any investor acquiring more than 25% of a company's stock to make a formal tender offer. Originally, the bill had set that level at 15%. Currently, there isn't any trigger point at which investors are required to make an offer.    In dealing with the issue of the right of the states to govern corporate matters -- a subject that has become sensitive as dozens of states have passed or considered adopting anti-takeover statutes -- the committee struck an apparent balance. It deleted language in the bill that explicitly affirmed states' rights to oversee corporate affairs, but also voted down an amendment offered by Sen. William Armstrong (R., Colo.) that effectively would have overridden the anti-takeover laws of several states.    The committee also rejected a &quot;one-share, one-vote&quot; amendment that would have prohibited the listing for trading of companies that in the future create unequal classes of common stock. Another provision that would have provided for secret voting in proxy contests was also narrowly voted down.    Remarks made in the course of the lengthy mark-up session indicated that the revised bill is still far from its final form. Several of the votes on the amendments were close, and at least two resulted in ties. &quot;I can't wait to debate this bill on the floor,&quot; said Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas). &quot;I suspect we're going to have a long and rich debate.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
