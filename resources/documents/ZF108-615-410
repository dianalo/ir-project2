(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>On-Line Documentation DeliversandM;If ever there existed a point of common suffering among information systemsusers, it is documentation.andP;  The pain transcends the monthly ritual ofremoving old pages from looseleaf binders and replacing them with updates.andO;Documentation has become such a chaotic, expensive and confusing aspect ofcomputer use that many users no longer bother consulting the manuals exceptas a last alternative.andM;There's a lot more at stake here than some programmer's prose buried in amanual.andP;  The real casualty is productivity, both for the preparers of thedocumentation and the users.andP;  The cost of publishing and distributing manualsand updates can be thousands of dollars a month.andP;  And enforcing themaintenance of manuals across a corporation, many companies have learned, isgrowing almost impossible.andM;In order to make documentation more accessible, many companies are putting iton line.andP;  For some personal computer applications, tools such as hypertextand on-line reference already deliver this feature.andP;  Stumped users can hit afunction key and explode a word into a help screen or a chapter ofdocumentation.andP;  They don't leave their workstations, and they can oftenresolve the problems in minutes.andM;But until recently, users of midrange and mainframe systems have had fewoptions for on-line documentation.andP;  Paper-based documentation has been almosta cultural imperative for builders and users of large systems.andP;  Despitegrowing complaints about the quality and administration of paperdocumentation, users have been largely inert, viewing paper-baseddocumentation as a kind of necessary evil with few or no alternatives.andM;The problems of documentation have not gone unnoticed, says Larry Overstreet,a senior design analyst with Morton international Inc.andP;  Overstreet says theChicago-based salt and chemical company has had a litany of troubles withtechnical manuals.andP;  &quot;They were paper.andP;  They were never up to date.andP;  If theywere up to date, the user probably couldn't find them.andP;  And if we had sentthem the latest copy--which was always open to doubt--the supervisor probablyhad the documentation up on a shelf so that the person who actually needed itcouldn't find it.&quot;andM;In 1986, Hewlett-Packard Co. conducted a customer satisfaction survey of itsinformation systems users.andP;  Among those responding were programmers and ISmanagers.andP;  &quot;One of the messages coming back was that we needed to dosomething about documentation,&quot; recalls Doug Iles, product developmentmanager for the Application Support Division at HP's Mountain View, Calif.andO;site.andM;The customers complained about inconsistencies in the structure of themanuals, a problem iles says sprang from HP's decentralized structure of 52autonomous divisions.andP;  &quot;We couldn't even get the logo the same on two piecesof documentation,&quot; he remembers.andM;There was more trouble.andP;  Information was hard to find in the manuals,complained HP's customers.andP;  &quot;Productivity was also becoming an issue,&quot; Ilessays.andP;  &quot;So was the amount of documentation.andP;  The actual floor space itconsumed was an issue in some circumstances.&quot;andM;Paper is MoneyandM;Besides productivity problems stemming from hard-to-find or outdated papermanuals, soaring costs and unwieldy distribution systems add to thedocumentation dilemma.andP;  One of the Big Five accounting firms in New York Citykept score by tracing documentation delivery to its technical staff.andP;  &quot;SeniorIS management recognized that we had a problem with the methods we used todistribute information internally,&quot; says an assistant vice president of ISwho asked to remain anonymous.andP;  &quot;Historically, we'd done it through labor-andpaper-intensive techniques, but the size of our organization does not permitthat to be done efficiently.andP;  What we found we were really doing wasmaintaining mailing lists and generating paper--usually several thousandcopies of whatever documentation--then distributing it within the ISorganization here.andP;  We were not doing a good job.&quot;andM;The accounting firm decided to invest in bringing its paper documentation online and chose ASSIST/GT from Alpharetta, Ga.-based GT Software Inc.andP;  So far,the accounting firm has put 5,000 pages of its IS-level documentation online--accessible to its 2,000 application development, maintenance and datacenter technicians with the touch of a key.andM;ASSIST/GT is an IBM mainframe-based package that enables any company withdocumentation maintained in electronic format--say, in word processing fileson a personal computer--to move that documentation to the mainframe.andP;  Oncethe information is on the mainframe.andP;  Once the information is on themainframe, it can be modified to suit user preferences.andP;  According to GTSoftware, ASSIST/GT does not modify an application's source code; rather, itworks in tandem with an application to add context-sensitive help functions.andM;Out of the Paper AbyssandM;Back at the Big Five accounting company, the payback from ASSIST/GT was fast.andO;&quot;We felt after the first month of distribution that we had saved the cost ofthe product in paper savings alone--about $20,000,&quot; says the IS executive.andM;This year the accounting company embarked on an even more ambitiouscost-cutting program to reduce paperwork.andP;  &quot;There is an effort under way toreduce the computer printer output that we deal with by $20 million,&quot; saysthe executive.andP;  &quot;We think we'll make inroads against that problem by usingthis product.&quot;andP;  Besides cutting back on paper documentation, the firm alsohopes to reduce its supply of paper reference works by putting them on lineas well.andM;With such potential advantages awaiting users--especially in light of theirscathing complaints about documentation--you'd think they would be lining upto put their documentation on line.andP;  That hasn't been the case so far.andP;  Theproblem of resistance appears to be one part habit and one part ignorance.andM;After HP analyzed its customer survey, it took action by creating ahigh-level Corporate Documentation Council.andP;  The group proposed putting HPdocumentation onto compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM) discs that could beaccessed through PCs with CD-ROM drives.andP;  This approach would allow HP tostore the equivalent of 25, three-inch-thick user manuals on a single disc.andM;When Hewlett-Packard introduced the concept to customers, 80% indicated thatthey still wanted to keep the paper documentation coming.andP;  Since 1987, whenthe company formally announced HP LaserROM as a supplement to its papermanuals, only 15% of its customer base has bought into documentation on disc.andO;However, the tide of acceptance is shifting among those users with hands-onexperience.andP;  &quot;Now only 20% [of LaserROM users] say they want to keep the hardcopy,&quot; says Iles.andP;  &quot;There's a significant migration to the alternativemedium.&quot;andM;On April 1, HP announced a more aggressive program whereby HP LaserROM willbecome a lower-cost, full-fledged alternative--not just a supplement--to thecompany's paper documentation.andP;  Iles anticipates that once users get theopportunity for hands-on use, acceptance will grow.andP;  &quot;I believe the unitcost, if somebody went out and ordered a second copy of the documentation forone of our operating systems, is about $13,000.andP;  It has to be delivered on acouple of pallets.&quot;andP;  Within a few years, HP anticipates that 50% of itscustomers will want documentation delivered on CD-ROM.andP;  If so, everybody willsave money, and not the least of them HP.andM;Indeed, last year the company tabulated the costs of shipping the paperdocumentation for a new release of UNIX to 800 field engineers worldwide.andO;&quot;We found it was so substantial,&quot; says Iles, &quot;that we could give them all PCswith compact disc drives and all of the documentation on compact disc, andstill save a lot of money.&quot;andP;  Even more savings is possible when LaserROM isset up to be accessed on a local area network using HP's LaserNet product.andO;When used on a LAN, LaserROM documentation can be made instantly available toall networked users without forcing them to get up from their PCs just toquery the disc in a centralized library.andM;HP, along with Digital Equipment Corp., IBM, and others that are pushingCD-ROM options for documentation, might be betting correctly on forthcominguser acceptance.andP;  Phil Hartl, assistant vice president, support, forChicago's Harris Trust and Savings Bank, took a chance on HP LaserROM lastOctober almost out of desperation.andP;  &quot;A large percentage of my time wasdevoted simply to looking up solutions to problems that the programmers, theoperators or the end users might have.andP;  We were looking for anything thatmight make my job a little easier.&quot;andM;The system worked.andP;  Hartl now says that 90% of the documentation inquiriescan be answered in 10 minutes or less.andP;  Meanwhile, the bank's paperalternative is growing far less attractive as a tool for problem solving.andO;&quot;I've got six linear feet of HP manuals,&quot; says Hartl.andP;  &quot;The very idea that Icould cross-index all of these documents to try to find the best solution toa problem is just ludicrous.andP;  Yet CD-ROM is able to reference that entiredocument base and find out all the possible resolutions, then boil them downso you can review them and pick the best one.&quot;andM;Not Abandoning PaperandM;Few can dispute the clear advantages of on-line documentation.andP;  But where HPand other sellers of various on-line documentation technologies may be offbase in their pitch for a perfectly &quot;paperless&quot; environment.andP;  Says Hartl: &quot;Iwas ready to throw my manuals out.andP;  But after having [HP LaserROM] in housefor a while, I got a little more realistic.andP;  LaserROM has very definitebenefits when you have a generalized question or a problem that doesn't haveany real target that you can go after.andP;  But if you have a very specificproblem area--say, someone wants to know how to use a COBOL verb--it's easierjust to reach up and grab the COBOL manual.&quot;andM;Jim Wright, a systems programmer for the Houston Chronicle, also isn't readyto forsake paper.andP;  Wright uses an on-line code-reference tool calledMVS/Quick-Ref, from Chicago-Soft Ltd., a Chicago-based vendor.andP;  The system isnot a complete repository of all MVS documentation, but a tool to deciphererror messages that would otherwise have to be looked up in a manual.andP;  Wrightis high on the software, and on-line documentation in general, but sees nowisdom in totally discarding paper manuals.andP;  &quot;The system might go down,&quot; hesays.andP;  &quot;And if the system's not up, on-line documentation just isn't going tohelp.&quot;andM;Still, Hartl envisions the day when manual documentation is all but gone.andO;&quot;There's the potential there, assuming the technology advances to the pointof having a good notebook computer with built-in CD-ROM capabilities,&quot; saysHartl.andP;  &quot;In essence, you could take the CD-ROM with you and read it on thetrain.andP;  Until that day comes, I can't see a total replacement [for paper].&quot;andM;The foremost truth of documentation is that it is useful only when it isaccessible, up to date and understandable.andP;  Subtract even one of thosefactors and it becomes just so much paper or words on a screen.andO;Unfortunately, documentation--whether authored by independent documentationspecialists or in-house programmers--has garnered a reputation for frequentlylacking all three.andM;A Matter of QualityandM;The quality problem is particularly acute for documentation that's producedin house.andP;  Programmers loathe the process because it is more administrativethan creative.andP;  As a result, documentation for internally developed softwareoften ends up being the last priority for the creators, a problem exacerbatedwhent he creators move on to new positions or leave the company--and theundocumented software--behind.andM;Of course, documenting systems can be an agony.andP;  &quot;We would write out thedocumentation longhand, then we'd give it to the secretaries,&quot; remembersOverstreet of Morton International, a current user of the mainframe-basedHELP system from On-Line Documentation Inc., of Yorba Linda, Calif.andP;  &quot;Thenthey would type it into a correct format.andP;  Later they'd hand it back forcorrections.andP;  Then we'd hand it back for retyping.&quot;andP;  The documentation oftenwas outdated before the process was complete.andM;With an on-line system, says Overstreet, the programming and documentationactivities can be melded into a simultaneous process.andP;  &quot;Now as soon as wemove an application into production, the documentation is right up to theminute,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;And it doesn't ever get lost.andP;  You just hit a PF key andthere it is.&quot;andM;Joseph Martin, standards and procedures coordinator for Yamaha Motor Corp.andO;USA, in Cypress, Calif., is in charge of all IS and computer-related userdocumentation for his company.andP;  He was originally hired to create manuals forinternally developed systems.andP;  &quot;I was brought in to generate documentation,&quot;he says.andP;  &quot;The future for me was just reams and reams of paper.andP;  The more Ithought about it, it just didn't make much sense.&quot;andM;Martin, like many of his contemporaries, didn't immediately see anyalternatives.andP;  &quot;I knew about on-line help for PCs, but I never associated itwith mainframes until I saw these [on-line help] packages,&quot; he says.andP;  Twoyears ago, he bought ASSIST/GT and became a believer.andM;&quot;We implemented on-line help for a brand new sales and distribution system,&quot;he says.andP;  &quot;It consisted of seven different subsystems.andP;  All together, we had125 different screens that we had to document.&quot;andP;  After the system went live,users voted almost unanimously in favor of on-line documentation for futuresystems.andM;On-Line LearningandM;Martin has noticed another critical and frequently overlooked benefit ofmaking documentation accessible and friendly: users became better studentsof, and ultimately more fluent in, their applications.andP;  &quot;The key benefit isthat users are utilizing the documentation much more than they would manualsbecause it's so handy,&quot; he says.andM;Iles of HP believes that on-line documentation, whether in a CD-ROM format orattached to the software more directly through on-line help screens, willfind a place alongside other important educational tools.andP;  &quot;When you talkabout documentation, on-line help, CBT [computer-based training] programs anduser reference manuals, you're really looking at a whole suite of knowledgetools that are available,&quot; he says.andM;New users, observers say, are the most frequent users of on-line help anddocumentation.andP;  &quot;Our newer programmers use it a lot,&quot; notes Wright of theHouston Chronicle.andP;  &quot;It's kind of like a cheat sheet.&quot;andP;  MortonInternational's Overstreet concurs.andP;  &quot;I would guess that, for a new user,productivity might be as much as 50% higher,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;If someone showsthem the key to press for help, they can just go from there.&quot;andM;Combining on-line documentation with computer-based training is Goal SystemsInternational Inc. of Columbus, Ohio.andP;  Its on-line reference tool, Preferenceversion 7.2, runs on IBM VM and MVS systems.andP;  Preference can be used inconjunction with Goal System's Phoenix CGT authoring system (also in release7.2), a program for creating on-line tutorials.andP;  When the two systems aretied together, users who are stumped on a particular portion of thedocumentation can go directly into a CBT tutorial for added instruction.andM;Although on-line documentation has been around since the early 1980s, it isstill largely in its first generation for non-PC platforms and software.andO;What users seem to want next boils down to the greater flexibility ofhypertext and artificial intelligence.andP;  As for hypertext, numerous usersurveys have shown he demand to be so strong that its appearance is assured.andO;Thanks to such popular hypertext tools as Apple Computer Inc.'s HyperCard,users and programmers know that the technology already exists to jump fromone topic to another by exploring a wide range of subject associations.andP;  It'sjust a matter of implementation.andM;Artificial intelligence-based assistance, although an attractive idea forsome, has more formidable technological and cultural obstacles to overcome.andO;Yamaha's Martin likes the idea of being able to pose a question and get ananswer from documentation.andP;  &quot;I think it would be sensational,&quot; he says.andP;  Butwill this ever happen?andP;  &quot;There's no question in my mind,&quot; says Hartl ofHarris Bank.andP;  &quot;HP already has [an AI] facility called the Expert SystemManager.andP;  It's an AI system written in Prolog that will assist small-siteusers with a lot of the common problems on the HP 3000 systems.&quot;andM;Future On-Line DocumentationandM;Others are even less optimistic.andP;  &quot;Most of the AI systems I've seen I haven'tliked very well,&quot; says Carl Downing, a senior technical analyst for BlueCross and Blue Shield of Minnesota in St. Paul, and an enthusiastic user ofMVS/Quick-Ref.andP;  &quot;A lot of those systems come to very dumb decisions.andP;  To me,the best intelligence is in the thing sitting on top of your head.&quot;andM;Still, even if AI is out of the picture, current users of on-line help anddocumentation technology think broad acceptance is looming.andP;  The notion willbe embraced when it is, well, embraced.andP;  As Martin says, people only come toreally appreciate its productivity and educational value after they've gottenhands-on experience.andP;  &quot;It's inevitable,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;I think the reason youdon't see it all over today is, one, most people don't even know that itexists.andP;  And, two, people are used to books.andP;  But once they find out abouton-line help, I just don't see how anyone can resist it.&quot;andM;Robert Hamilton is president of The Hamilton Group.andP;  Dennis Hamilton is aprincipal with Software Analytics.andP;
