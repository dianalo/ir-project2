Doug Hall, founder of Richard Saunders International Inc.in Cincinnati, gives clients up to 50 new-product ideas andsales forecasts within 30 days.   That compares with months or years that it takes most newproducts to be developed and tested. Mr. Hall and hiscolleagues, who include both engineers and marketingspecialists, have 47 patents, for products from cake pans totoxic-waste incinerators.   The key to his firm's speed is a single consumer-feedbacksession that melds features of traditional focus groups andtest marketing. In the session, a representative sample ofpeople use keyboards to answer questions about a product;their responses move directly into a computer data base.   &quot;This approaches test-market results in terms of accuracy,but it's more timely,&quot; says Lynn Kahle, chairman of theUniversity of Oregon's marketing department, who has studiedMr. Hall's methods. It's also much cheaper.   Clients say it works. &quot;It's lightning fast,&quot; says AustinMcNamara, a vice president of marketing and sales at DinnerBell Foods, a division of Chiquita Brands International,which recently hired Mr. Hall to develop a new line ofproducts.   The company also forecasts the potential for new productsdeveloped by others. Starting next month, his firm, alongwith Marketing Intelligence Service Ltd., a new-productresearch firm in Naples, N.Y., will publish a newsletter,AcuPoll Reports, grading new products on an A-to-F scale,based on consumer's ratings.   The new McDonald's Lean Deluxe sandwich, for example,rates an A. But Mr. Hall cautions that its initial popularitymay fade. One reason: The 91% fat-free burger tastesdifferent from other McDonald's burgers.   Nestle's new Nescafe Mocha Cooler, a chilled chocolatecoffee drink, gets a D. &quot;Cold coffee is bad coffee to theAmerican consumer,&quot; Mr. Hall says.                                                                                                          Pittsburgh Pastor Gets   Religion for Promotions                                                                                                          THE PULPIT isn't the only place where a Pittsburghpreacher peddles prayer.   East Liberty Presbyterian Church has been losing membersfor four decades, in part because of the high death rate inthe graying Steel City. &quot;We lose three dozen members a yearto deaths,&quot; says Senior Pastor Robert A. Chesnut. Membershiphas plunged to 700 from 2,800 in 1951.   So Mr. Chesnut began recruiting new members. He boughtbillboards around the city to promote Easter worship. Ads inthe local papers appear in the entertainment section, ratherthan in traditional church listings. &quot;I want to reach anaudience who won't look on the church pages,&quot; he says.   The church recently mailed 7,000 brochures inviting localdoctors and lawyers to discuss genetic engineering; 125showed up. This month, the church is sponsoring a folkconcert by a Russian bluegrass artist.   The campaign seems to be working. Since it began lastyear, attendence has jumped 30%, Mr. Chesnut says.   More churches may have to try such methods. The proportionof regular churchgoers has held steady at about four of every10 people, says Martin Marty, a University of Chicagoprofessor who studies the history of American religion. So,in some areas, such as Pittsburgh, the number of worshipershas fallen.   But drawing new members can be tough. &quot;You're competingfor a finite market,&quot; Mr. Marty says. &quot;There are no Jews outthere waiting to hear from the East Liberty PresbyterianChurch.&quot;                                                                                                          Commercial Tie-Ins Muddy   Earth Day Observance                                                                                                          EARTH DAY could easily be renamed Marketing Day.   Companies looking to link their products to this year'sApril 22 celebration have created some odd partnerships.Procter andamp; Gamble, a favorite target of environmentalists, isadvertising several products in an Earth Day magazine to besold at Hardee's restaurants this month. The publication willinclude a diaper ad that has drawn flak for promoting Pandamp;G'sPampers and Luvs brands as easily compostable.   Pandamp;G says the ad educates consumers about developingtechnologies for composting. But critics, who say the ad ismisleading because the composting technology mentioned forthe diapers isn't widely available, are outraged that theplug is linked to Earth Day. &quot;That's the last place that adshould appear,&quot; says Judith Enck, senior environmentalassociate at the New York Public Interest Research Group.   Meanwhile, EarthWorks Press, publisher of &quot;50 SimpleThings You Can Do to Save The Earth,&quot; is printing specialeditions of the book for Earth Day promotions. An EarthWorksspokeswoman says: &quot;Businesses want to appear moreenvironmentally friendly.&quot;   The biggest order, for a million copies, is fromTambrands, maker of Tampax tampons. Its edition has atwo-page message on the company's environmental good deeds,such as using recycled cardboard in cartons. The book, with apale-blue cover like a Tampax box, will be given away withtampon purchases.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          IF LIQUOR companies can't advertise on TV, they'll take itto the stage. That's the plan for Johnnie Walker Black, whichwill sponsor a summer tour of &quot;City of Angels,&quot; anaward-winning musical. The bottle even gets a cameoappearance when a star takes a swig. . . . Supporters ofnatural gas try a personal touch. A recent quarter-page ad inPeople magazine reads: &quot;Highly successful advertisingexecutive seeks honest and open dialogue. . . . Enjoy sports,the fine arts . . . and have a total commitment to clean airand gas water heaters.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
