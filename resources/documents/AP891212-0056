Environmentalists and South Pacific nations have criticizedJapan and Taiwan for using giant drift nets in the region. The netssweep as much as 30 miles of ocean and critics say they killvirtually all fish and marine animals that swim into them.   ``In the South Pacific we will stop, at least temporarily, thecatching of albacore tuna by an agreed date, with the expectationthat when management control measures for the preservation ofmarine resources are agreed upon, it will be reopened,'' ForeignMinistry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said.   Watanabe did not say when Japan would halt the practice, butanother Foreign Ministry official said it would be by 1992.   Kyodo News Service said Japanese and U.S. representatives at theUnited Nations had agreed on a draft resolution calling for an endto drift-net fishing in the region's international waters by June30, 1992, except where protective measures have been taken.   Ministry officials said the decision would not apply to theNorth Pacific because measures were being taken to preserve marineresources in that region.   Japanese officials say drift nets are the most economical meansof harvesting fish in the open seas.   Last year, the number of Japanese drift net boats in the SouthPacific surged from 20 to 60 and Taiwan's fleet included at least60 vessels.   Following criticism from the region, Japan said it would reduceits number to 20 this season, and Taiwan promised to reduce itsfleet to 24.</TEXT></DOC>
