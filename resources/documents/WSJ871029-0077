Opponents of altering the legal barrier separating commercial and investment banking are using last week's record stock market fall to bolster their arguments for preserving the law, known as the Glass-Steagall Act.    But Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke told a House Banking subcommittee that &quot;the events of the past week (don't) take away anything from&quot; the arguments for change. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman William Seidman, at the same hearing, said: &quot;Despite the problems in the equities market, this is the time to deal with . . . the restructuring of financial services.&quot;    Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) earlier this month had planned to introduce legislation repealing Glass-Steagall, but after the market's crash he decided to put it off.    Both Messrs. Clarke and Seidman told lawmakers that banks should be allowed to underwrite securities through a subsidiary and that the parent bank could be sufficiently insulated from the risks involved in that business.    Some lawmakers were skeptical, though. Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) said Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co.'s admission that it made improper cash advances to an options-clearing subsidiary last week showed &quot;how legal separation may not work at a time of crisis.&quot;    The same day it occurred, federal regulators ordered Continental Illinois, a Chicago-based unit of Continental Illinois Corp., to correct the violation. On Monday, bank officials signed an agreement with the comptroller's office promising to never let it happen again.    In New York, the incident was also cited yesterday by Edward O'Brien, head of the Securities Industry Association, who called the regulators' arguments in favor of altering Glass-Steagall &quot;a classic case of lack of common sense.&quot;    Mr. Seidman told the lawmakers that the market's decline should result in &quot;no material difference&quot; in the number of bank failures this year or next. The FDIC expects bank failures in 1988 to decline 25% from this year. A total of 153 federally insured banks have failed so far in 1987, and regulators say the number may climb as high as 200 for the year.    Banks have benefited from the huge sell-off in the stock market, Mr. Seidman said. Deposits have increased as some of the money that had been in the market has been put in bank accounts, and the decrease in interest rates has cut banks' operating costs. </TEXT></DOC>
