The department said the gross national product, a measureof the economy's total output, shrank at a 0.1% annual rateafter inflation in the second quarter. Last month, thedepartment said GNP grew at a 0.4% rate in the period.</LP><TEXT>   The revision was relatively modest given the vagaries ofgovernment statistics, and the figure could well return tothe positive side of the ledger when later changes areannounced next month. &quot;I don't think the revision changed theworld too much,&quot; said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist withPNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh.   Many economists agree that the recession ended sometimethis spring. Nevertheless, because the second-quarter numberwent from positive to negative, it injected further pessimisminto the debate about the strength of the recovery. GNPfigures now show that the economy contracted for threeconsecutive quarters; it posted a sharp 2.8% decline in thefirst three months of this year and dropped 1.6% in the lastquarter of 1990.   &quot;The GNP does tell us that the economy remained in a slumpthrough the second quarter,&quot; said Bruce Steinberg, senioreconomist for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;This definitely shows usthat the recovery is very, very puny,&quot; agreed Boston Co.economist Allen Sinai.   President Bush was more optimistic. &quot;I feel all rightabout things,&quot; he said. &quot;There are some statistics up andsome down, but basically I think it's doing all right.&quot;   Michael Boskin, the president's top economic adviser, saidthe new GNP number is &quot;still quite consistent with the viewthat the economy is in the very early stages of a modestrecovery, whose strength and duration are still to bedetermined.&quot;   The Commerce Department attributed much of the revision toa large liquidation of inventory. Ironically, that changeprobably means third-quarter GNP growth will be stronger thanotherwise, because companies most likely will have to replacelost inventories. &quot;Inventories are so low that any increasein demand will elicit that much stronger of a productionresponse, and that will mean more jobs,&quot; said RobertChandross, chief economist for Lloyds Bank PLC.   Analysts expressed surprise at a downward revision inconsumer spending to show a 2.8% growth rate rather than the3.6% jump previously reported. They hadn't expected such achange because retail sales figures released by thegovernment last month included raised estimates for May andJune sales.   The Commerce Department attributed part of the adjustmentin consumer spending to an accounting change: Some car salesthat had been counted as consumer spending were reclassifiedas business spending.   Despite the new number, many economists still believe therecession ended in the second quarter. Victor Zarnowitz, aprofessor at the University of Chicago's business school anda member of a private panel that dates the beginning and endof recessions, says assertions that the latest downturn endedin March were probably premature. Referring to the latestrevision, however, he said: &quot;All of this is very, very small,but certainly people will make much of it and it may have apsychological impact.&quot;   In a sign of the recession's impact on businesses, thegovernment said in a related report that corporate after-taxprofits slumped 1.6% to $163.7 billion in the second quarter,the lowest level since the third quarter of 1989.
