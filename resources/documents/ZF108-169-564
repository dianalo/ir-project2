(products).andO;Product:   CompuAdd HardCache/ESDI (Control board).andO;Topic:     Disk DrivesControllersEvaluationHard DiskBoards-Cards.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>CompuAddandM;HARDCACHE/ESDI CARDandM;In terms of &quot;bang for the buck,&quot; the CompuAdd HardCache card is the mosteffective.andM;This full-length ESDI controller -- competitively priced at $495 with itsminimum 256K bytes of cache memory -- was the only device to use a securedirect write-through method to write data to a PC.andM;Though slower, the write-through memory-cache method is more reliable thanthe write-back method used by the other reviewed controllers because data iswritten to the hard disk immediately upon PC request.andP;  As a result, data lossis minimal with write-through devices in the case of power loss.andM;In contrast, write-back controllers wait for a trigger before data is savedto disk.andM;PC Week reviewed a HardCache/ESDI Card with its maximum of 4M bytes ofon-board cache memory.andP;  Memory is upgraded with single in-line memory module(SIMM) chips.andP;  In performance tests, CompuAdd's board ranked second --peaking at 932K bytes per second when reading data and 660K bytes per secondwhen writing data.andM;The unit comes with its own disk BIOS that must be enabled for properoperation.andP;  The CompuAdd controller BIOS is similar to the standard IBM PC ATdisk BIOS, so it needs no drivers to run in MS-DOS, Unix, Xenix, OS/2 orNovell Inc.andP;  NetWare environments.andP;  Jumpers on the board offer two differentBIOS addresses, C800 and CA00.andP;  (See sidebar, Page 81.)andM;Unlike the other controllers reviewed here, the CompuAdd board uses customchips to control all aspects of seeking, reading and writing to disks -- theothers rely on commodity microprocessors.andM;A well-illustrated guide makes installation and controller operation easy.andO;In addition, the hard- and floppy-drive connectors are all horizontallyaligned across the top of the card, allowing cables to flow easily overexisting PC add-in cards.andM;However, to retain configuration information when a PC is powered down, autility that writes drive information to a complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) -- such as Storage Dimensions Inc.'s SpeedStor -- mustbe used.andP;  IBM PC AT and 386 PCs have at least 256 bytes of CMOS memory intowhich information is recorded for use when a PC starts up.andP;  This includesdate, time and type of floppy.andP;  The most important CMOS data has to do withthe hard disk.andM;CompuAdd's bundled HCU hard-cache utility provides options to customize theboard's cache-memory management, display statistics about cacheeffectiveness, and enable, flush and disable the controller cache memory.andM;CompuAdd, of Austin, Texas, can be reached at (800) 999-9901.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;I paid $495 for a controller that reads 20 percent faster than a $1,295 DPTproduct,&quot; said Michael Chiedell, president of Florida Datamation Inc., asystems integrator in Boca Raton, Fla.andP;  &quot;I am very happy with the [HardCachecard] and pleased with its performance.andP;  When putting in an expensive fileserver, what's $495?&quot;andM;CompuAdd's memory-upgrade scheme proved to be another advantage for Chiedell.andO;&quot;With CompuAdd I can use [standard] SIMM strips, whereas the DPT locks youinto proprietary RAM boards,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;After looking at the market, I found companies asking exorbitant prices,&quot;said David Long, senior systems analyst at Vista Wall Architectural, amanufacturer of curtain-wall sheathing in Terrell, Texas.andP;  &quot;[The HardCachecard] was an exceptional buy.andP;  At its price, I didn't really have anything tolose.&quot;andM;Long, who has been using HardCache for more than six months, is also pleasedwith its performance.andP;  &quot;[Once installed,] my hard-disk access time read at0.3 milliseconds and was 100 percent faster than Core [International's]standard drive without a caching controller,&quot; he said.andM;As for compatibility, &quot;Unix, Xenix and DOS have run flawlessly,&quot; said Long.andO;&quot;I have a DOS and Unix network running on a Compaq 16MHz 386 and a Micronics33MHz 386.andP;  For databases and large transactions, [the HardCache card] speedsup the process tremendously.&quot;andM;</TEXT></DOC>
