ADLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Overestimating future sales and the value of itsassets when it went private led to the demise of Fruehauf Corp.,which sold the last of its holdings to keep bill collectors at bay,analysts say.   The ultimate failure of the leveraged buyout attempted by theworld's largest maker of truck trailers could foreshadow troublefor other companies still trying to pay off debts incurred throughrestructuring, analysts said Tuesday.   In Fruehauf's case, the leveraged buyout led to liquidation andthe end of a 75-year-old company once among the top 200manufacturing companies in the nation.   The projections on which Fruehauf based its leveraged buyout mayhave been fantasy, said Donald Ratajczak, director of economicforecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta.   ``When you're dealing with the trucking industry, (projecting)five years without a downturn is absurd,'' Ratajczak said.   Fruehauf borrowed $1.5 billion to restructure itself in 1986 inthe face of a hostile takeover attempt by investor Asher Edelman.   ``The trailer business turned much too slow for them. Theyoverpaid when they took it private,'' said Rolf W. Wagner, ananalyst with Scott andamp; Stringfellow in Richmond, Va.   The sale of Fruehauf's Kelsey-Hayes division, which producesauto and truck wheels, will bring in $66 million in cash and $430million in notes. Kelsey-Hayes is the company's last significantasset.   Analysts at Roney andamp; Co. in Detroit said it is doubtful Fruehaufmanagement profited from the liquidation. However, Merrill Lynch,which handled the sale of various Fruehauf divisions andsubsidiaries, received a windfall in fees and stock, said TonyViscogliosi, a Roney analyst who has followed Fruehauf for the past2{ years.   ``They've gotten six times their original investment in Class Ashares'' by selling the company off piecemeal, he said.   Merrill Lynch spokesmen in New York did not return phone forcomment.   Ratajczak said investment companies are calling the shots in theleveraged buyout game.   ``The truth is, it's being motivated out of downtown Manhattan.There's a network of these firms out there trying to convincecompanies they're worth more by restructuring. After the fees arethrough, these guys are out of there,'' he said.   Fruehauf's peddling of assets began in 1987 with the sale of itsfleet of 5,000 leased trailers. If the sale of Kelsey-Hayes toVarity of Toronto goes through, only Fruehauf's nameplate on itstrucks will remain.   Also in 1987, Fruehauf sold its international and domestictrailer rental operations, financial subsidiary, aerospace unit,heavy-duty auto group, 91 percent of its interest in Fruehauf ofCanada, 60 percent of its European trailer operations.   Last year, it sold off the balance of its trailer manufacturingoperations _ its founding and main business segment _ and itsmaritime operations, which included two ship yards, and its heavycrane manufacturing and heavy cargo handling equipment.   ``It was clear that they were selling their businesses to paydown their debt to survive,'' Viscogliosi said.</TEXT></DOC>
