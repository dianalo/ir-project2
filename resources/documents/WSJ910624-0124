However, itsproposed alternative to President Bush's crime bill wouldmake law enforcement even more difficult than today, no smallfeat.   This year's exercise is part &quot;deja vu,&quot; part the Bushadministration negotiating against itself.</LP><TEXT>   The original version of Senator Joe Biden's crime billincluded provisions similar to last year's. It would haveprohibited any execution &quot;if that person's death furthers aracially discriminatory pattern.&quot; Whatever this means, itlooked like a demand for a racial quota on death row based onthe local racial percentages. This provision was dropped lastweek, but look for it to reappear in the House version.   The Biden bill would overrule the most important SupremeCourt reform of the endless appeals of death penalties. Inthe case of Teague vs. Lane, the Justices limited the newappeals that convicts can make to legal arguments based onthe law as it was when their trial occurred. The Biden billwould instead continue the current system of continuingappeals. Even when criminals confess to murder, it takesnearly a decade between the death sentence and the execution.   The Bush administration, apparently catching the virus,walked away from one of its own best proposals last week.This provision would have enacted what Attorney GeneralThornburgh has dubbed the &quot;inclusionary rule.&quot; It would letthe jury see evidence of a gun used in a crime even if therewas a Fourth Amendment search-and-seizure violation. Theoffending law-enforcement officer would then be disciplineddirectly. As President Bush said in offering his proposal,&quot;It never did make sense that because a policeman has made amistake, a dangerous criminal can get off scot-free.&quot; TheBush bill still includes minor reforms of the exclusionaryrule, but the rule itself would remain.   The Biden bill would actually expand the exclusionary ruleby cutting back on the &quot;good-faith&quot; exception created by theSupreme Court. The Justices no longer suppress evidence whenpolice acted on a good-faith reliance on a warrant that turnsout to be faulty. The Biden bill would limit even thisexception. It would also reverse two courts of appeal rulingsthat extend the good-faith exception to cases of searchesmade without warrants.   Then there is the Brady Bill. As we've said (and even manyof the bill's supporters don't seriously disagree) aseven-day waiting requirement before a gun dealer can sell ahandgun to a customer is not going to have a measurableimpact on crime. Most states have no central record offelons. It would only make sense to have a waiting period ifwe have a national data bank of people who everyone can agreeshouldn't have firearms. Otherwise we are talking about asymbolic waiting period, which would inconvenience thelaw-abiding and encourage the already healthy illicit marketfor guns in inner cities.   President Bush threatens to veto any bill that wouldencourage endless death-penalty appeals, expand theexclusionary rule or enact the Brady Bill without any way toidentify people who shouldn't get guns. Outside the fringesof Democratic politics, Mr. Bush has plenty of support forthis stance. Poll after poll shows that crime is one of thebiggest worries of Americans in every income and regionalgroup. Every day's edition of any large urban daily newspapermakes it perfectly obvious that the poor are especially atrisk, making effective law enforcement the chief missingingredient of the constitutional promise of civil rights.   Congress needs to decide whether it wants to fight crimeor vote for a bill that claims to fight crime while doing theopposite. If Congress decides to create new roadblocks to lawenforcement, the Members will have to explain what it isabout the level of safety on our streets today that demands acrime bill to make punishment more difficult.   As the debate unfolds on a crime bill, the Democrats inCongress need to reflect on something on which they areindeed expert: Americans stopped electing liberal Democratsto the presidency when voters no longer felt they could betrusted with the country's external defense. It may not belong before the voters conclude that they can't trust thissame party to maintain domestic order inside the country,either.</TEXT></DOC>
