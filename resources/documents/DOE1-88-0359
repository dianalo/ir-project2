To achieve this end, wind observations froma data set of high spatial density are compared to model predictionsof the wind. Additionally, gross turbine powers, derived from the windobservations, are compared to the same quantity calculated from model-derivedwind speeds. The model is operated using two approaches. With the firstapproach, The model is operated repeatedly in an attempt to constructwind speed frequency distributions over the modeled area; from thesedistributions mean speeds and gross powers are determined. With the secondapproach, the model is run only once using mean speeds as input. Whenthe first approach is used, it is found that the wind speed and turbinepower prediction errors are about 5% and 11%, respectively. When thesecond approach is employed, the wind speed and power prediction errorsare about 5% and 13%, respectively. (Because the gross turbine powerdoes not include many factors that influence turbine performance, theerror in model predictions of actual turbine power is likely to be substantiallyhigher, although this is no fault of the model.) Two other aspects ofmodel application are also briefly investigated. First, it is found thatthe modeling results are sensitive to the location of the tuning sites;second, values of the model's stability parameter, {tau}, and the calculatedwind direction, {theta}, derived for one modeling domain, are not transferrableto a nearby domain. 5 refs., 17 figs., 10 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
