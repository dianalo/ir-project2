This action is taken in response to amendments to theResource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), enacted in the Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984. Today's notice promulgates specifictreatment standards and prohibition effective dates for certain SecondThird wastes, and imposes the ``soft hammer'' provisions of 40 CFR 268.8on Second Third wastes for which the Agency is not establishing treatmentstandards. In addition, this notice promulgates treatment standards andeffective dates for certain First Third (40 CFR 268.10) ``soft hammer''wastes, as well as for certain wastes originally contained in the ThirdThird of the schedule (40 CFR 268.12). Wastes for which treatment standardsare being promulgated can be land disposed after the applicable effectivedates only if the respective treatment standards are met, or if disposaloccurs in units that satisfy the ``no migration'' standard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This final rule is effective June 8, 1989, exceptfor EPA Hazardous Waste F006_cyanide (nonwastewater) which is effectiveJuly 9, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The official record for this rulemaking is identifiedas Docket Number F-89-LD11-FFFFF and is located in the EPA RCRA docket,Room 2427, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Summary of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 and theLand Disposal Restrictions Framework<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Statutory Requirements</ITAG>The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA), enacted on November 8,1984, prohibit the land disposal of hazardous wastes. Specifically, theamendments specify dates when particular groups of hazardous wastes areprohibited from land disposal unless ``it has been demonstrated to theAdministrator, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that there will beno migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit or injectionzone for as long as the wastes remain hazardous'' (RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1),(e)(1), (g)(5); 42 U.S.C. 6924 (d)(1), (e)(1), (g)(5)). Congress establisheda separate schedule for restricting the disposal by underground injectionof solvent- and dioxin-containing hazardous wastes, wastes referred tocollectively as California list hazardous wastes (RCRA section 3004(f)(2),42 U.S.C. 6924(f)(2)), and soil and debris resulting from CERCLA section104 and 106 response actions and RCRA corrective actions when the soiland debris contains listed spent solvent, dioxin, and California list hazardouswastes.The amendments also require the Agency to set ``levels or methods of treatment,if any, which substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantiallyreduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the wasteso that short-term and long-term threats to human health and the environmentare minimized'' (RCRA section 3004(m)(1), 42 U.S.C. 6924(m)(1)). Wastesthat meet treatment standards established by EPA are not prohibited andmay be land disposed. In addition, a hazardous waste that does not meetthe treatment standard may be land disposed provided the ``no migration''demonstration specified in RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1), (e)(1) and (g)(5)is made.For the purposes of the restrictions, HSWA defines land disposal ``to include,but not be limited to, any placement of * * * hazardous waste in a landfill,surface impoundment, waste pile, injection well, land treatment facility,salt dome formation, salt bed formation, or underground mine or cave''(RCRA section 3004(k), 42 U.S.C. 6924(k)). Therefore, because HSWA definesland disposal to include underground injection wells, disposal of hazardouswastes in injection wells is subject to the land disposal restrictions.The land disposal restrictions are immediately effective unless the Administratorgrants a national variance from the statutory or regulatory deadline andestablishes a different date (not to exceed two years beyond the applicabledeadline) based on ``the earliest date on which adequate alternative treatment,recovery, or disposal capacity which protects human health and the environmentwill be available'' (RCRA section 3004(h)(2), 42 U.S.C. 6924(h)(2)). TheAdministrator may also grant a case-by-case extension of the effectivedate for up to one year, renewable once for up to one additional year,when an applicant successfully makes certain demonstrations (RCRA section3004(h)(3), 42 U.S.C. 6924(h)(3)). A case-by-case extension can be grantedwhether or not a national capacity variance has been granted.The statute also allows treatment of hazardous wastes in surface impoundmentsthat meet certain minimum technological requirements (or certain exceptionsthereto). Treatment in surface impoundments is permissible provided thetreatment residues that do not meet the treatment standard(s) (or applicablestatutory prohibition levels) are ``removed for subsequent management withinone year of the entry of the waste into the surface impoundment'' (RCRAsection 3005(j)(11)(B), 42 U.S.C. 6925(j)(11)(B)).In addition to prohibiting the land disposal of hazardous wastes, Congressprohibited storage of any waste which is prohibited from land disposalunless ``such storage is solely for the purpose of the accumulation ofsuch quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate properrecovery, treatment or disposal'' (RCRA section 3004(j), 42 U.S.C. 6924(j)).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Applicability to Injected Wastes</ITAG>As noted above, disposal of hazardous wastes in injection wells is subjectto the provisions of HSWA. The Agency has previously proposed and promulgatedregulations pertaining to injected wastes separately from regulations addressingwastes disposed in surface facilities. The Agency chose this approach fortwo reasons. First, injection of hazardous wastes is controlled by twostatutes, RCRA and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The regulationsgoverning injection of these wastes have been codified along with otherregulations of the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program under theSDWA in Parts 124, 144, 145, 146, 147, and 148 of the Code of Federal Regulations(CFR). EPA believes that it is useful to the regulated community and tothe State regulators to have requirements regarding restrictions on hazardouswaste injection located in the same portion of the CFR as are other requirementspertaining to injection wells. Second, the statute established a separateschedule for the restrictions on injection of certain wastes.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Solvents and Dioxins </ITAG>Effective November 8, 1986, HSWA prohibited land disposal (except by undergroundinjection into deep wells) of dioxin-containing hazardous wastes numberedF020, F021, F022, and F023 and solvent-containing hazardous wastes numberedF001, F002, F003, F004, and F005 listed in 40 CFR 261.31. (RCRA sections3004 (e)(1), (e)(2), 42 U.S.C. 6924 (e)(1), (e)(2)).On November 7, 1986, EPA promulgated a final rule (51 FR 40572) implementingRCRA section 3004(e). This rule not only established the general frameworkfor the land disposal restrictions program, but also established treatmentstandards for the F001-F005 solvent wastes and F020, F023 and F026-F028dioxin-containing wastes. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. California List Wastes </ITAG>Effective July 8, 1987, the statute prohibited further land disposal (exceptby deep well injection) of the following listed or identified wastes (RCRAsection 3001) set out in RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1) and (d)(2) (42 U.S.C.6924 (d)(1), (d)(2)). (A) Liquid hazardous wastes, including free liquids associated with anysolid or sludge, containing free cyanides at concentrations greater thanor equial to 1,000 mg/l. (B) Liquid hazardous wastes, including free liquids associated with anysolid or sludge, containing the following metals (or elements) or compoundsof these metals or elements) at concentrations greater than or equal tothose specified below: (i) arsenic and/or compounds (as As) 500 mg/l; (ii) cadmium and/or compounds (as Cd) 100 mg/l; (iii) chromium (VI and/or compounds (as Cr VI)) 500 mg/l; (iv) lead and/or compounds (as Pb) 500 mg/l; (v) mercury and/or compounds (as Hg) 20 mg/l; (vi) nickel and/or compounds (as Ni) 134 mg/l; (vii) selenium and/or compounds (as Se) 100 mg/l; and (viii) thallium and/or compounds (as Tl) 130 mg/l. (C) Liquid hazardous wastes having a pH less than or equal to two (2.0).(D) Liquid hazardous wastes containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)at concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm. (E) Hazardous wastes containing halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) intotal concentration greater than or equal to 1,000 mg/kg. On July 8, 1987, EPA promulgated a final rule (52 FR 25760) implementingRCRA section 3004(d). This rule established treatment standards for Californialist wastes containing PCBs and certain HOCs, and codified the statutoryprohibition for liquid corrosive wastes. The statutory prohibition is alsoin effect for California list wastes containing free cyanides, metals,and dilute HOC wastewaters. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Disposal of Solvents, Dioxins and California List Wastes in InjectionWells </ITAG>Section 3004(f) of RCRA required that the Administrator prohibit the disposalof solvents, dioxins and California list wastes in deep wells, effectiveAugust 8, 1988, unless such disposal had been determined to be protectiveof human health and the environment for as long as the wastes remainedhazardous or unless a variance had been granted under RCRA section 3004(h).On July 26, 1988, the Agency established effective dates for the prohibitionon injection of solvents and dioxin wastes (53 FR 28118). In another regulation,effective August 6, 1988 and published August 16, 1988 in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Agency established, in part, effective datesfor the prohibition on injection of California list wastes (53 FR 30908).<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Scheduled Wastes </ITAG>The amendments required the Agency to prepare a schedule for restrictingthe land disposal of all hazardous wastes listed or identified as of November8, 1984 in 40 CFR Part 261, excluding solvent- and dioxin-containing wastesand California list wastes covered under the schedule set by Congress.The schedule, based on a ranking of the listed wastes that considers theirintrinsic hazard and their volume, is to ensure that prohibitions and treatmentstandards are promulgated first for high volume hazardous wastes with highintrinsic hazard before standards are set for low volume wastes with lowintrinsic hazard. The statute further requires that these determinationsbe made by the following deadlines: (A) At least one-third (the First Third) of all listed hazardous wastesby August 8, 1988. (B) At least two-thirds (the Second Third) of all listed hazardous wastesby June 8, 1989. (C) All remaining listed hazardous wastes and all hazardous wastes identifiedby one or more of the characteristics defined in 40 CFR Part 261 (the ThirdThird) by May 8, 1990. On May 28, 1986, EPA promulgated the schedule for setting treatment standardsfor the listed and identified hazardous wastes (51 FR 19300). This scheduleis incorporated in 40 CFR 268.10, 268.11, and 268.12. If EPA fails to set a treatment standard by the statutory deadline forany hazardous waste in the First or Second Third, the waste may be disposedin a landfill or surface impoundment provided ``such facility'' is in compliancewith the minimum technological requirements specified in RCRA section 3004(o)for new facilities (RCRA section 3004(g)(6)).<ITAG tagnum="21">Note: On August 17, 1988, EPA interpreted the term ``such facility''in 3004(g)(6) to refer to the individual surface impoundment or landfillunit. See 53 FR 31181. This interpretation was upheld by the D.C. Circuitin <T3>Steel Bar Mills</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3>, No. 88-1608 (Order of Feb. 22, 1989).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In addition, prior to land disposal, the generator must certify tothe Administrator that he has investigated the availability of treatmentcapacity and has determined that he has contracted to use the practicallyavailable technology that yields the greatest environmental benefit, orthat disposal in such landfill or surface impoundment is the only practicalalternative to treatment currently available to the generator. This restrictionon the use of landfills and surface impoundments applies until EPA setsa treatment standard for the waste or until May 8, 1990, whichever is sooner.Other forms of land disposal, including underground injection, are notsimilarly restricted and may continue to be used for disposal of untreatedwastes until EPA promulgates a treatment standard and sets an effectivedate, or until May 8, 1990, whichever is sooner. If the Agency fails toset a treatment standard for any scheduled hazardous waste by May 8, 1990,the waste is automatically prohibited from all forms of land disposal afterthat time unless the waste is the subject of a successful ``no migration''demonstration (RCRA section 3004(g)(5), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(5)). For the scheduled wastes, the statute does not provide different deadlinesfor restriction of underground injected versus surface land disposed wastes;however, the Agency proposed and promulgated First Third regulations forsurface disposed and injected wastes on separate dates. The First Thirdfinal rule, promulgated on August 8, 1988 and published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31138), set out theconditions under which wastes may continue to be land disposed by meansother than by injection. Effective dates for the prohibition of injectionof certain First Third wastes are included in the final regulation publishedAugust 16, 1988 (53 FR 30908). In addition, the Agency promulgated effectivedates for the prohibition on injection of another group of First Thirdwastes on June 14, 1989 (54 FR 25416). Today's final rule promulgates theconditions under which Second Third wastes may continue to be land disposed.It also promulgates treatment standards for some First Third and ThirdThird restricted hazardous wastes. This rule applies to all forms of landdisposal including deep well injection, and finalizes the January 11, 1989proposed rulemaking (54 FR 1056). <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Newly Identified and Listed Wastes </ITAG>RCRA requires the Agency to make a land disposal prohibition determinationfor any hazardous waste that is newly identified or listed in 40 CFR Part261 after November 8, 1984 within six months of the date of identificationor listing (RCRA section 3004(g)(4), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(4)). However, thestatute does not provide for an automatic prohibition of the land disposalof such wastes if EPA fails to meet this deadline. B. Regulatory FrameworkThe November 7, 1986 final rule (51 FR 40572) established the regulatoryframework for implementing the land disposal restrictions program. Somechanges to the framework were made in the July 8, 1987 California listfinal rule (52 FR 25760), as well as in the August 17, 1988 First Thirdfinal rule (53 FR 31138). Regulations specifying how the framework appliesto injected wastes were promulgated July 26, 1988 (53 FR 28118).The following discussion summarizes the major provisions of the land disposalrestrictions framework. (For a comprehensive understanding of the LandDisposal Restrictions program, refer to the aforementioned final rules.)It is included for purposes of information only, any does not reopen andof the previously-stated principles for judicial review.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Applicability</ITAG>The land disposal restrictions apply prospectively to the affected wastes.In other words, hazardous wastes land disposed after the applicable effectivedates are subject to the restrictions, but wastes land disposed prior tothe effective dates are not required to be removed or exhumed for treatment(51 FR 40577). Similarly, only surface impoundments receiving restrictedwastes after the applicable deadline are subject to the restrictions ontreatment in surface impoundments contained in 40 CFR 268.4 and RCRA 3005(j)(11).Also, the storage restrictions apply to wastes placed in storage afterthe effective dates.The provisions of the land disposal restrictions program apply to wastesproduced by generators (including small quantity generators) of greaterthan 100 kilograms of hazardous waste (or greater than 1 kilogram of acutelyhazardous waste) in a calendar month. Wastes produced by small quantitygenerators of less than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste (or less than1 kilogram of acute hazardous waste) per calendar month are conditionallyexempt from RCRA, including the land disposal restrictions (see 40 CFR268.1).The land disposal restrictions apply to both interim status and permittedfacilities. The requirements of the land disposal restrictions programsupersede 40 CFR 270.4(a); therefore, even though the requirements maynot be specified in the permit conditions, all permitted facilities aresubject to the restrictions.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Treatment Standards</ITAG>By each statutory deadline, the Agency must establish the applicable treatmentstandards under 40 CFR Part 268 Subpart D for each restricted hazardouswaste. After the applicable effective dates, restricted wastes may be landdisposed if they meet the treatment standards. If EPA does not promulgatetreatment standards by the statutory deadlines, such wastes are prohibitedfrom land disposal (with the exception of First Third and Second Thirdwastes that are subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions of 40 CFR 268.8).A treatment standard is based on the performance of the best demonstratedavailable technology (BDAT) to treat the waste (51 FR 40578). EPA may establishtreatment standards either as specific technologies or as performance standardsbased on the performance of BDAT technologies. Compliance with performancestandards may be monitored by measuring the concentration level of thehazardous constituents (or in some circumstances, indicator pollutants)in the waste, treatment residual, or in the extract of the waste or treatmentresidual. When treatment standards are set as performance levels, the regulatedcommunity may use any technology not otherwise prohibited (such as impermissibledilution) to treat the waste to meet the treatment standard. Treaters thusare not limited to use of only a particular technology. However, when treatmentstandards are expressed as specific technologies, such technologies mustbe employed.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. National Variances from the Effective Dates</ITAG>The Agency has the authority to grant national variances from the statutoryor regulatory effective dates, not to exceed two years, if there is insufficientalternative protective treatment, recovery or disposal capacity for thewastes (RCRA section 3004(h)(2)). If there is a significant shortage ofsuch capacity nationwide, EPA will establish an alternative effective datebased on the earliest date such capacity will be available.During the period a capacity variance is in place, disposal in a landfillor surface impoundment may be made only in a unit meeting the minimum technologicalrequirements of RCRA section 3004(o). The D.C. Circuit recently upheldthe Agency's interpretation of the term ``such facility'' in section 3004(h)(4)to refer to the disposal unit.

It is the Agency's opinion,however, that if a waste subject to a national capacity variance is treatedto meet the applicable treatment standards (or meets the standards as generated),the land disposal restrictions allow such waste to be disposed in a SubtitleC landfill or surface impoundment regardless of whether the unit meetsminimum technological requirements (MTRs) (but see RCRA sections 3004(o)(1)and 3005(j)(1), which independently require that certain surface impoundmentsand landfills meet MTRs). This is because such waste, once treated to meetthe promulgated treatment standard (or which meets such standard as generated),is no longer prohibited from land disposal. In addition, from a policyperspective, if a person treats a national capacity variance waste to meeta treatment standard, thus electing not to take advantage of the variance,he should receive some benefit under the law and thus should be able toutilize non-MTR landfills and impoundments as he would if the Agency hadnot granted the national capacity variance.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Case-By-Case Extensions of the Effective Dates</ITAG>The Agency will consider granting up to a one-year extension (renewableonce) of a ban effective date on a case-by-case basis. The requirementsoutlined in 40 CFR 268.5 must be satisfied. During the period that sucha case-by-case extension is in place, disposal in a landfill or surfaceimpoundment may be made only in a unit meeting the minimum technologicalrequirements of RCRA section 3004(o). In considering whether to grant acase-by-case extension, the Agency has stated that it will consider thefeasibility of providing alternative capacity during the extension period,and that the determination of feasibility ``may involve considerationsof the technical and practical difficulties associated with providing alternativecapacity.'' (51 FR 40603, Nov. 7, 1986.) EPA wishes to clarify that inassessing questions of feasibility, it will never base a decision solelyon the assertion that alternative treatment is too costly.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. ``No Migration'' Exemptions From the Restrictions</ITAG>The Agency has the authority to allow the land disposal of a restrictedhazardous waste which does not meet the treatment standard upon the successfuldemonstration that there will be no migration of hazardous constituentsfrom the disposal unit or injection zone for as long as the waste remainshazardous (for surface disposed wastes see 40 CFR 268.6; for undergroundinjected wastes see 40 CFR 148.20). If a ``no migration'' petition is granted,it can remain in effect for no longer than ten years for disposal in interimstatus land disposal units, and for no longer than the term of the RCRApermit for disposal in permitted units (40 CFR 268.6(h)).The Agency's plan for implementing the ``no migration'' provisions of RCRAwith respect to injected wastes are outlined in detail in 40 CFR 148.20(53 FR 28118, July 26, 1988). A petitioner is required to demonstrate throughmodeling that there is no migration of hazardous constituents from theinjection zone for as long as the waste remains hazardous. This demonstrationcan be made in one of two ways: The use of flow and transport models toshow that injected fluids will not migrate vertically out of the injectionzone for a period of 10,000 years or laterally within the injection zoneto a point of discharge or interface with an underground source of drinkingwater; or, use of geochemical modeling to show that the waste is transformedso it will become nonhazardous at the edge of the injection zone. Also,a showing must be made that the well is in compliance with the substantivearea of review, corrective action, and mechanical integrity requirementsof Part 146.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Variances From the Treatment Standards</ITAG>The variance from the treatment standard procedures were established toaccount for cases where the treatment standard is expressed as a performancelevel and the waste, after properly-conducted treatment, cannot meet thelevel, or where the treatment technology is not appropriate for the waste.The petitioner must demonstrate that because the physical or chemical propertiesof the waste differs significantly from the wastes analyzed in developingthe treatment standard, the waste cannot be treated to specified levelsor by the specified methods (51 FR 40605 and 40 CFR 268.44). The varianceprocedure can result in the establishment of a new treatability group andcorresponding treatment standard that applies to all wastes meeting thecriteria of the new waste treatability group. A site-specific variancefrom the treatment standard may also be granted administratively (withoutrulemaking), but the variance has no generic applicability to the wasteif it is generated at other sites (53 FR 31199, August 17, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Exemption for Treatment in Surface Impoundments</ITAG>Wastes that would otherwise be prohibited from one or more methods of landdisposal may be treated in a surface impoundment that meets certain technologicalrequirements (RCRA section 3005(j)(11) and 40 CFR 268.4(a)(3)) as longas treatment residuals that do not meet the applicable treatment standard(or statutory prohibition levels where no treatment standards are established)are removed for subsequent management within one year of entry into theimpoundment and are not placed into any other surface impoundment. Theowner or operator must certify to the Regional Administrator that the impoundmentmeets the liner, leachate collection system and ground water monitoringrequirements imposed by RCRA section 3004(o)(1) (unless the impoundmentqualifies for an exemption from those requirements under RCRA sections3005 (j)(2) and (j)(4)). The owner or operator must also submit a copyof the waste analysis plan that has been modified to provide for testingtreatment residuals in accordance with andSection; 268.4 requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Storage of Restricted Wastes</ITAG>Storage of restricted wastes is prohibited except where storage is solelyfor the purpose of accumulating sufficient quantities of wastes to facilitateproper treatment, recovery, or disposal (RCRA section 3004(j) and 40 CFR268.50). A facility that stores a prohibited waste for more than one yearbears the burden of proving that such storage is solely for this purpose.The Agency bears the burden of proof if it believes that storage of a restrictedwaste by a facility for up to one year is not for the purpose of accumulatingsufficient quantities to facilitate proper treatment, recovery, or disposal.Since any placement of wastes in landfills, piles, impoundments, etc. isdefined as land disposal (RCRA section 3004(k)), only storage in tanksand containers is affected by the storage prohibition in andSection; 268.50(see 52 FR 21013, June 4, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="81">9. The ``Soft Hammer'' Provisions</ITAG>The First and Second Third wastes for which EPA has not promulgated treatmentstandards may be disposed in landfill and surface impoundment units, providedcertain demonstrations are made, and provided these units meet the minimumtechnology requirements of section 3004(o) as specified in 40 CFR 268.8.The Agency's reading that ``soft hammer'' wastes destined for landfillor impoundment disposal can only be disposed in minimum technology landfillsand surface impoundment units was upheld by the D.C. Circuit in <T3>Steel Bar Mills Ass'n</T3>. v. <T3>EPA</T3>, No. 88-1608 (order of Feb. 22, 1989), and endorsed in <T3>dicta</T3> in <T3>Mobil Oil Corp. </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3><T2>X</T2>F.2d<T2>X</T2> (D.C. Cir., April 4, 1989, slip op. at 7-8). The ``soft hammer''provisions apply only until May 8, 1990, or until EPA promulgates treatmentstandards, whichever is sooner. Other types of land disposal are not restricteduntil EPA promulgates treatment standards and effective dates, or untilMay 8, 1990.C. Summary of the Proposed RuleThe Agency proposed treatment standards and effective dates for 32 SecondThird wastes. In addition, the Agency proposed treatment standards andeffective dates for 19 First Third wastes which previously had been subjectto the ``soft hammer'' provisions, as well as for 14 Third Third wastesand 4 newly listed wastes. Effective dates for wastes being undergroundinjected were also proposed. No changes to the land disposal restrictionsframework were proposed. The proposed approach, as well as any changesbeing made in today's final rule, is discussed in preamble section IIIof today's rule.D. Comments Received on the Proposed RuleThe Agency received 92 comments addressing various elements of the proposedrule. Some of the most frequently discussed issues were: the proposed treatmentstandards for cyanide wastes, the use of ``no land disposal'' as a treatmentstandard, and rescheduling of wastes from the Third Third to the SecondThird. A summary of these issues, along with the Agency's response, isprovided in the appropriate preamble sections related to the individualwaste codes of today's rule.The Agency also received comments on the applicability of the land disposalrestrictions to wastes included in lab packs and on the advance noticeof the Agency's proposed approach for regulating the remaining listed andcharacteristic wastes by May 8, 1990. A summary of these comments and theAgency's responses follows in this section.Detailed summaries of all comments and the Agency's responses can be foundin the documents ``Comment Response Document for the Second Third LandDisposal Restrictions Proposed Rule'', Volumes 1-3, in the RCRA docket.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Regulation of Lab Packs</ITAG>The Agency received several comments related to the regulation of lab packsunder the land disposal restrictions framework. Some commenters requestedan exemption from the land disposal restrictions for lab packs. Other commentersrequested that the Agency establish as the treatment standard a specifiedtreatment method for the entire lab pack, disregarding the treatment standardsapplicable to the wastes it contains. Several commenters requested relieffrom the paperwork burden associated with providing notice of each restrictedwaste in the lab pack and its corresponding treatment standard (as requiredunder the land disposal restrictions recordkeeping requirements). Commentersalso stated that there may be hundreds of wastes included in a lab packand the land disposal restrictions require that applicable treatment standardsor ``soft hammer'' requirements be met for each waste prior to land disposal.They assert that such regulation is inappropriate for lab packs.The Agency addressed the issue of applicability of the land disposal restrictionsto lab packs in the final rule promulgated on November 7, 1986 (see 51FR 40584-85), and is not changing its position in today's final rule. TheAgency maintains that these wastes cannot be exempt from the statutoryrequirements since the plain language of the statute includes them, andthere is no indication in the legislative history to exclude lab packsfrom the land disposal restrictions if they contain restricted wastes.With respect to means of easing the administrative burden on lab packs,the Agency is sympathetic to the concerns voiced, but lacks the time andresources (given the pressing statutory deadlines) to take action in thisrulemaking, particularly when no clearly acceptable approach is now apparent.The Agency is thus today soliciting further comment and data on issuesassociated with lab packs. The Agency requests data and specific suggestionssupporting treatment options for lab packs. The Agency also solicits specificsuggestions on modifications that could be made to the notification andcertification requirements, in order that the administrative burden forlab packs might be somewhat relieved, while at the same time satisfyingthe ``cradle to grave'' paper trail for hazardous wastes regulated underthe land disposal restrictions.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Advance Notice of Third Third Approach</ITAG>Several comments addressed the Agency's advance notice of an approach forregulating the remaining listed and characteristic hazardous wastes byMay 8, 1990. The Agency appreciates these comments and suggestions, andwill consider them when proposing land disposal restrictions for the ThirdThird later this year. The Agency will respond to comments received onthe advance notice in the Response to Comments Document for Third Thirdwastes.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Comments on Stabilization of Organics</ITAG>Comments were received in response to the Agency's request for data onthe effectiveness of stabilization of organic constituents. The Agencywill evaluate these comments prior to promulgation of the Third Third finalrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Today's Final Rule</ITAG>Today's notice describes the Agency's final approach to implementing RCRAsection 3004(g) requirements with respect to certain listed hazardous wastesincluded in 40 CFR 268.11 (as well as andSection;andSection; 268.10 and 268.12).The Agency is required to promulgate regulations establishing conditionsunder which Second Third wastes may be land disposed by the statutory deadlineof June 8, 1989.A. Applicability of Treatment Standards Today the Agency is promulgating treatment standards and effective datesfor only certain Second Third wastes. Wastes listed in 40 CFR 268.11 forwhich EPA does not establish treatment standards or effective dates aresubject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions that allow continued land disposaluntil May 8, 1990, or until treatment standards are promulgated, whicheveris sooner (40 CFR 268.8).The Agency is also promulgating treatment standards for certain First Third``soft hammer'' wastes, as well as certain Third Third wastes, to becomeeffective immediately upon promulgation. The Third Third wastes includedin today's final rule were originally scheduled to be prohibited from landdisposal by May 8, 1990. These wastes are included in today's rule becauseof the similarity of the Third Third wastes to First or Second Third wastetreatability groups for which treatment standards are being promulgated.The Agency maintains that the original schedule promulgated May 26, 1986(51 FR 19300) is not irrevocable: the Agency retains a continuing authorityto shift particular wastes from one third of the schedule to another (see<T3>Chemical Waste Management </T3>v. <T3>EPA</T3>, 839 F. 2d 1526, 1529 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1989). The statutorylanguage likewise indicates that scheduling decisions are committed solelyto the Agency's discretion (RCRA section 3004(g)(3)), and that prohibitionsneed not be delayed until the end of a scheduling period to take effect(see, e.g., RCRA section 3004(g)(1): ``Not later than * * *''). Given theCongressional concern about an expeditious end to land disposal of untreatedhazardous wastes (see e.g., RCRA sections 1002(b)(7), 1003(5), 1003(6)),it also makes sense from a policy perspective to accelerate prohibitionswhere it is possible to do so. Thus, the Agency is not precluded from proposingor promulgating treatment standards for any wastes ahead of schedule.In addition, the Agency is amending the schedule so that certain SecondThird wastes are moved to the Third Third. The Agency is moving wastewaterresidues resulting from certain treatment methods (i.e., metals recovery,metals precipitation, cyanide destruction, carbon adsorption, chemicaloxidation, steam stripping, biodegradation, and incineration or other directthermal destruction provided such treatment methods are well-designed andwell-operated) for which EPA has not promulgated wastewater treatment standards.This action is being taken in order that residues from substantial treatmentof these ``soft hammer'' wastes may be further treated in land disposalunits that do not meet minimum technology requirements. As was explainedin the First Third final rule (53 FR 31184), the Agency finds justificationfor such action in that wastes that have undergone substantial treatmentto levels that may ultimately satisfy treatment standards should not beprecluded from further treatment in polishing or advanced biological treatmentunits (RCRA sections 3005 (j)(3) and (j)(13)) that are substantially protectiveof human health and the environment.It should be noted that the Agency moved all multi-source leachate derivedfrom most listed hazardous wastes to the Third Third in a final rule promulgatedon February 27, 1989 (54 FR 8264). The February 27, 1989 rule thus appliesto multi-source leachate derived from disposal of Second Third listed hazardouswastes. This action has the effect of rescheduling the residues from treatingthe leachate and to contaminated ground water or soil that contain suchleachate. <T3>Id.</T3> Other restricted wastes not initially part of the leachatethat are mixed with it, however, are not rescheduled and thus remain subjectto all applicable statutory and regulatory prohibitions. <T3>Id.</T3>EPA is today deleting andSection; 268.12(c), as adopted in the August 17,1988 First Third regulation. That provision rescheduled leachate derivedfrom management of soft hammer wastes to the Third Third. By reschedulingall multi-source leachate to the Third Third, this provision is no longernecessary. The only leachate to which it would still apply would be single-sourceleachate, and EPA has already determined that all prohibitions and standardsfor single-source leachate should take effect immediately (see 54 FR 8265,Feb. 27, 1989). Consequently, there is no reason for this provision toremain in effect.The Agency is moving Second Third wastes that are mixed hazardous/radioactivewastes to the Third Third. As was explained in the First Third final rule(53 FR 31147), there are relatively small volumes of such waste mixturesbeing generated, so such waste is more appropriately addressed in the ThirdThird.B. Best Demonstrated Available Technologies (BDAT)Today's final rule defines waste treatability groups and identifies theBest Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT) for each (see preamble sectionIII.A.). Treatment standards applicable to each treatability group arebased on the performance levels achievable by the corresponding BDAT. Anytechnology not otherwise prohibited (i.e., impermissible dilution) maybe used to meet concentration-based treatment standards. Where treatmentstandards are expressed as a specified technology, the waste must be treatedusing the specified technology prior to land disposal.Following are tables listing BDAT for the wastes for which treatment standardsare promulgated in today's rule:<ITAG tagnum="81">Best Demonstrated Available Technologies for Wastes Included in Today'sFinal Rule </ITAG>1.

Applicabilityof Today's Rule to Class I-H Hazardous Waste Injection Wells RegulatedUnder 40 CFR Part 148 The Agency has previously proposed and promulgated regulations and effectivedates for underground injected hazardous wastes covered under RCRA sections3004(f) and (g) separately from regulations addressing wastes disposedin surface facilities. The Agency is today addressing all methods of landdisposal, including injection wells regulated jointly under the Safe DrinkingWater Act (SDWA) and RCRA. D. Waste Analysis Requirements The Agency is today finalizing for Second Third wastes the waste analysisrequirements already promulgated in the First Third final rule (53 FR 31146).Where BDAT is a destruction or removal technology, a total waste analysisis required because it is most appropriate for measuring such destructionor removal. Similarly, where BDAT is identified as an immobilization technologysuch as stabilization, analysis of a TCLP waste extract is required becauseit is the most appropriate measure of immobilization. In cases where bothtypes of technology are identified as BDAT, both types of waste analysesare required. In order for the initial generator to determine whether his waste meetsthe applicable treatment standard as generated, he should analyze the totalwaste if a treatment standard is in andSection; 268.41, or he should analyzea waste extract if the treatment standard is found in andSection; 268.43.The generator may also make this determination based on his knowledge ofthe waste provided there is a reasonable basis for doing so as, for example,the generator using so little of a key constituent that it could not befound in the waste at levels exceeding a treatment standard (51 FR 40597,Nov. 7, 1986; and andSection; 268.7(a)). E. Nationwide Extensions of the Effective Date Due to lack of sufficient alternative protective treatment or recoverycapacity, EPA is granting a national capacity extension for soil and debriscontaminated with certain waste codes covered by today's final rule. Atwo-year extension, until June 8, 1991, is granted for soil and debriscontaminated with First, Second, and Third Third wastes for which treatmentstandards promulgated in today's rule are based upon the performance ofincineration. (See preamble section III.C.2.) A capacity variance is also granted for certain wastes disposed by undergroundinjection. A two-year extension of the effective date, until June 8, 1991,is granted for hazardous waste codes F007, K009 (wastewaters), K011 (nonwastewaters),and K013 (nonwastewaters) (see preamble section III.C.3.). EPA has determined to establish an effective date of July 8, 1989 for theF006_cyanide (nonwastewater) treatment standard. Although existing informationindicates that the treatment standard is readily achievable with existingtreatment systems, the delayed effective date will provide any time neededfor generators to adjust or fine tune existing treatment systems, or toenter into contracts with commercial treaters. At the same time, giventhe information showing that well over 90 percent of generators are alreadyachieving treatment standards and the existence of excess commercial treatmentcapacity (see preamble section III.C.), EPA does not believe that the regulatedcommunity needs any longer period to come into compliance with the newstandard (see RCRA section 3010(b)(1)). EPA does not believe that section 3004(h)(1) mandates an immediate effectivedate for the cyanide standard for F006 nonwastewaters. Section 3004(h)(1)applies to prohibitions issued under sections 3004(d)-(g). The cyanidestandard is not a prohibition of the waste (since F006 is already prohibitedunder the First Third rule), but rather an additional treatment standardissued pursuant to section 3004(m). The general policy of section 3004(h),however, provides good cause within the meaning of section 3010(b)(3) fornot delaying the new standard's effective date for any more than 30 days.The Agency is also delaying the effective date for 30 days, until July8, 1989, for F007, F008, and F009 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. EPA hasdetermined that no long term national capacity variance for these wastesis warranted. The extension is being granted, however, in order to be cautiousand allow time (if any is truly needed) for facilities to adjust existingcyanide treatment processes to operate more efficiently, or to enter intocontracts with commercial treatment facilities. EPA is also granting a 30-day capacity extension to F011 and F012 wastewatersand nonwastewaters, until July 8, 1989. Additionally, for the period betweenJuly 8, 1989 and December 8, 1989, F011 and F012 nonwastewaters will besubject to the same cyanide standards as the electroplating wastes (i.e.,590 mg/kg for total cyanide and 30 mg/kg for amenable cyanide). EffectiveDecember 8, 1989, however, these wastes must meet the 110 mg/kg total cyanidestandard and the 9.1 mg/kg amenable cyanide standard (see preamble sectionIII.C.1. for further discussion of the effective dates). F. Treatment Standards for Prohibited Wastes that are Mixed with Non-ProhibitedWastes Prohibited wastes are not exempted from the land disposal prohibitionswhen they are mixed with other wastes (or any other materials, for thatmatter.) Were this not the case, land disposal prohibitions would be withoutmeaning since they could be evaded by the expedient of mixing with a non-prohibitedwaste. (See 54 FR 8265, Feb. 27, 1989.) Prohibited wastes are sometimes mixed with other materials in the courseof treatment. If the prohibited waste is no longer capable of being treatedto meet the treatment standard after mixing, it is possible that an improperform of mixing is occurring. The Agency realizes and acknowledges, however,that mixing wastes can be a normal part of treatment. Therefore, to theextent that such mixing occurs and can be determined to be a legitimatepart of the treatment process, the mixture could be eligible for a treatabilityvariance pursuant to andSection; 268.44. Part of the demonstration, however,would be whether mixing has made the prohibited waste more difficult totreat, and if so, whether the treatment method utilized is still legitimate.It should be evident that intentional mixing to evade a treatment standardis impermissible, and if such intentional mixing occurs, it never couldserve as grounds for granting a treatability variance under andSection; 268.44.The Agency further expects that generators and treatment facilities wouldtake reasonable steps to avoid mixing waste streams that are generatedseparately if such mixing is not a legitimate part of the treatment process.For example, it would ordinarily be inappropriate to mix a metal-bearingwaste like F006 with a halogenated organic waste like F024.The status of mixtures that consist of multi-source leachate and othernon-leachate First Third prohibited wastes is presently controlled by arecent order filed by the D.C. Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit. In that order, the Court left in effect (by mutual consent ofthe parties) a judicial stay of the applicability of the so-called wastecode carry-through principle to multi-source leachate. The order continues,``[a]s to anything contaminated both by leachate and by other first-thirdprohibited wastes, the other wastes must, to the extent technically feasible,be treated to the applicable treatment standards. Prohibited wastes intentionallymixed with leachate for the purpose of avoiding applicable treatment standardsremain subject to all of the standards and requirements in the August 8,1988 rule.'' Order of April 24, 1989 in <T3>Chemical Waste Management </T3>v. <T3>EPA</T3>, No. 88-1581.EPA interprets this order in the following way: First, by requiring thatall non-leachate First Third prohibited wastes be treated ``to the extenttechnically feasible'', the Court made clear that only technical considerationsare involved in the determination, and that the cost of treatment is nota relevant consideration. (In fact, the Court amended its earlier orderof September 23, 1988, which required treatment ``to the extent feasible'',in response to the government's pleading that cost could not legally beconsidered in determining treatment standards.) In determining whethertreatment has occurred to the extent technically feasible, it ordinarilywould be necessary to address the possible means of treating all of thehazardous constituents in the prohibited waste, including both organicsand inorganics.Second, all of the parties in their pleadings to the Court representedthat any mixing of prohibited wastes and multi-source leachate that occurred<T3>after</T3> September 23, 1988, the date of the first amended orderentered by the Court related to this situation, would be deemed to be mixingwith the purpose of avoiding a treatment standard and that therefore allapplicable treatment standards would continue to apply to the non-leachateprohibited waste(s) in such mixtures. (See Petitioners' Response of April13, 1989 at pp. 5-6, 8 expressing this understanding, and Petitioners'Supplemental Response of April 24, 1989 characterizing language suggestedby petitioners that documents this understanding as stating that ``restrictedwastes in such mixtures occurring on or after the date of amendment ofthe stay order will have to be treated to the applicable treatment standards,notwithstanding the presence in the mixture of multi-source leachates.'')Consequently, any prohibited waste that was mixed with multi-source leachateafter September 23, 1988 remains subject to treatment standards.EPA believes that any person seeking to dispose of a leachate-non-leachateFirst Third prohibited waste mixture would have the burden of demonstratingthat the mixture has been treated to the extent technically feasible. Thisis because that person would be claiming an exception to a remedial statutoryscheme, see, e.g., <T3>SEC</T3> v. <T3>Ralston Purina Co</T3>., 346 U.S. 119, 126 (1953), and in additionwould be in possession of facts within its special knowledge. The Agencynotes in addition that States could evaluate the validity of an ``extenttechnically feasible'' claim only if the State is authorized to administerthe land disposal prohibition regulations. Since no State is so authorizedat the present time, any regulatory concurrence would have to come fromEPA.EPA believes it important that the Court's order not be used as a meansto evade technically achievable treatment standards. Therefore, the Agencyrecommends careful evaluation of any claim that one of these mixtures hasbeen treated to the extent technically feasible. In addition, the Agencyrecommends that EPA headquarters personnel be notified of such claims inorder to assist in the technical determination and in order to have technology-baseddeterminations of waste treatability be as consistent as possible.G. Rationale for Immediate Effective DateThe regulations promulgated today will be effective immediately exceptwhere the Agency has specified a national extension of the effective dateor otherwise specified an alternative effective date. HSWA requires thattoday's regulations become effective on or before the June 8, 1989 effectivedate of the restrictions on the second one-third of the wastes scheduledpursuant to RCRA section 3004(g)(4)(A). If the Agency fails to promulgateregulations for any of these wastes by the statutory effective date, therestrictions on disposal of the waste in a landfill or surface impoundment,stipulated in section 3004(g)(6)(B) take effect automatically on June 8,1989. If the Agency has not promulgated treatment standards for any scheduledwaste by May 8, 1990, that waste is prohibited from all forms of land disposalunless a generator has been granted an extension of the effective date(either a national capacity extension or a case-by-case extension) or a``no migration'' finding has been made. Hence, June 8, 1989 is the latestdate for EPA to promulgate regulations that will prevent the ``soft hammer''in section 3004(g) from becoming effective for all Second Third wastes.Section 3004(h) requires that regulations established under sections 3004(d), (3), (f), or (g) be effective immediately upon promulgation. Furthermore,section 3004(m) specifies that regulations setting treatment standardsmust have the same effective date as applicable regulations establishedunder sections 3004 (d), (e), (f), or (g). For today's regulations whichset treatment standards and are promulgated under section 3004(g), thisdate will be June 8, 1989. Since the statute clearly states that the regulationsimplementing section 3004(g) must go into effect on or before June 8, 1989in order to prevent the ``soft hammer'' from falling, EPA finds that goodcause exists under section 3010(b)(3) to have an immediate effective date.For the same reason, EPA finds that good cause also exists under section554(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. section 553(d)(3),to waive the requirements that regulations be published at least 30 daysbefore the effective date.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Detailed Discussion of Today's Rule</ITAG>A. Development and Identification of Treatment StandardsToday's rule promulgates BDAT treatment standards for many Second Thirdwastes, some First Third wastes for which land disposal has been previouslyrestricted according to the ``soft hammer'' provisions, and several ThirdThird wastes. Sections III.A.1. through III.A.11. of the January 11, 1989Proposed Rule (54 FR 1062-1104) presented discussions on the determinationof treatability groups and the development of treatment standards for RCRAhazardous wastes. Sections III.A.1. through III.A.7. (54 FR 1062-1065)presented an overview of the general procedures that the Agency followsfor these determinations. A detailed discussion of the methodology foridentification of BDAT is provided in the November 7, 1986 Final Rule forSolvents and Dioxins (51 FR 40572). The Agency specifically stated thatit did not reopen the issues presented in these sections for public comment,but merely restated the Agency's position on these issues in order to savereaders the trouble of referring to earlier documents. The same is truefor most of the reiterated discussions in today's preamble. However, theAgency is also adding a clarifying discussion of certain issues, particularlythe comparison of treatment standards to Practical Quantitation Limits(PQLs), and the use of grab and composite samples for purposes of establishingand enforcing treatment standards.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Clarification of the General Applicability of BDAT</ITAG>a. <T3>Wastewater versus nonwastewater standards</T3>. The treatment standardsin today's rule are generally expressed as constituent concentrations for``wastewaters'' and for ``nonwastewaters''. The treatment standards applyto the prohibited waste as well as to all residuals generated by treatingthe original prohibited waste. Therefore, solids generated from treatmentof a particular waste must meet the nonwastewater treatment standards andwastewaters generated from treatment of this waste must meet the wastewatertreatment standards. Section III.A.3.(f.) and (h.) of today's rule providesa discussion of the applicability of treatment standards to treatment residualswhere BDAT is established as a method of treatment rather than as numericalconcentration-based standards.For purposes of this rule, the Agency defines wastewaters as those wastes(listed wastes, including wastes generated as a result of the ``mixture''and ``derived-from'' rules) that contain less than 1% total organic carbon(TOC) and less than 1% total suspended solids, except for those wastesidentified as F001, F002, F003, F004, and F005 solvent-water mixtures.See 53 FR 31145 (August 17, 1988) adopting this definition for First Thirdwastes and 51 FR 40579 (November 7, 1986) for the definition of F001, F002,F003, F004, and F005 solvent-water mixtures. Those wastes (listed wastes,including wastes that are hazardous as a result of the ``mixture'' and``derived-from'' rules) that do not meet these criteria are defined asnonwastewaters and thus would contain greater than or equal to 1% TOC,or greater than or equal to 1% total suspended solids. It is not permissibleto dilute or perform partial treatment on a waste in order to switch theapplicability of a nonwastewater standard to a wastewater standard (orvice versa). (See 52 FR 21012 (June 4, 1987); but see 52 FR 25767 (June8, 1987) noting special circumstances when California list wastes are involved).Dewatering technologies (such as filtration and centrifugation) that aredesigned to separate wastewater from nonwastewaters are not prohibited.b. <T3>Analytical requirements and relationship of PQLs to BDAT</T3>. Forall wastes in today's rule, BDAT has been identified as a destruction technologyfor all of the organic constituents and for cyanides. The correspondingtreatment standards for these constituents are based on the analysis oftotal concentration. Since these technologies are specifically designedto destroy the organics and cyanides, the Agency maintains that the bestmeasure of treatment performance is the one that reflects the extent towhich these organics and cyanides have been destroyed.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4> The land disposal restrictions for solvent waste codesF001-F005 (51 FR 40572) require the analysis of TCLP extracts as a measureof performance. At the time that the treatment standards for F001-F005were promulgated, useful data were not available on total constituent concentrationsin treated residuals and, as a result, the TCLP was considered to be thebest available measure of performance.</ITAG>In cases where treatment standards for metals in nonwastewaters are basedon stabilization, the use of the TCLP is required as a measure of the performanceof the treatment technology. The Agency maintains that where data are available,the TCLP data best reflect the extent to which the mobility of these metalscan be minimized. Where treatment standards for nonwastewaters are basedon multiple treatment processes due to the presence of organics and metals,the waste has to meet both total constituent concentrations for organicsand TCLP concentrations for metals prior to land disposal.The Agency evaluates all BDAT list constituents when establishing treatmentstandards. This list of chemicals was derived from the constituents listedin 40 CFR Part 261 Appendix VII and Appendix VIII. The rationale for selectionof the particular constituents to be regulated can be found in the backgrounddocument for each waste or waste treatability group. The Agency believesthat it is not restricted to regulating only those constituents for whicha waste is listed (40 CFR Part 261 Appendix VII). This is appropriate giventhat Appendix VII, setting forth the constituents that were the basis forlisting, is not an exhaustive list of hazardous constituents in each waste,and was never intended to be. (See RCRA section 3001(f), a provision designedto force EPA to consider hazardous constituents other than those for whichthe waste was listed when evaluating delisting petitions. Section 3001(f)thus acknowledges that Appendix VII is only a partial list of the hazardousconstituents that can be present in a listed waste.)EPA has been asked a number of questions about the relationship of BDATtreatment standards to the practical quantitation limits (PQLs) for a numberof constituents. In response, it is important to clarify the definitionof PQLs, their intended use, and their relationship to BDAT treatment standards.In the September, 1986, edition of SW-846 (Volume 1B, Chapter 1, p. 1-9),the Agency defines PQLs as follows: ``The practical quantitation limit(PQL) is the lowest level that can be reliably achieved within the specifiedlimits of precision and accuracy during routine laboratory operating conditions.''Further, in Method 8250 of SW-846 (the analytical method for determinationof semivolatile organics in wastes by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry)the Agency states ``Sample PQLs are highly matrix-dependent. The PQLs listedherein are provided for guidance and may not always be achievable'' (<T3>Ibid</T3>, Table 2, p. 8250-5), and further defines PQLs as the methoddetection limit (from Table 1, p. 8250-2, 3, and 4) multiplied by a matrixdependent factor that was estimated for four matrices (Table 2, p. 8250-5).As evident from the above citations, the Agency recognizes the importanceof the dependency of the waste matrix to the level of PQLs obtainable.The Agency also recognizes that PQLs listed in SW-846 are not always achievablefor constituents as measured in untreated wastes. However, the Agency pointsout that the levels of PQLs are directly related to the amount of interferencesthat are present in the different waste matrices. Most treatment processes,particularly destructive technologies such as incineration, do not destroyonly the hazardous constituents of the waste. They destroy other organicspresent that typically interfere with the analysis for constituents inuntreated wastes. Thus, PQLs are typically significantly lower for treatmentresiduals such as incinerator ash than for untreated wastes. These differencesin PQLs for untreated and treated wastes are demonstrated in almost everyBDAT background document where incineration has been established as BDAT.With respect to the use of PQLs, the Agency points out that PQLs were establishedas a means of guidance for analysis of waste samples and were intendedto act as minimum performance criteria for analytical laboratories. Theydo not necessarily represent the lowest limits of achievable analyticalperformance for any given waste. They were also intended to be broadlyapplied to groups of wastes. The matrix dependent correction factors werenot developed for any particular waste code, and as listed in Table 2 (citedabove) do not specifically apply to any particular treatment residuals(i.e., Table 2 only lists correction factors for matrices identified asground water, low-level soil, high-level soil, and non-water miscible waste).Further, the Agency is currently in the process of modifying and expandingthese matrix correction factors, as well as modifying the detection limitsfrom which the PQLs are derived.The major point of confusion regarding PQLs is that the PQLs noted in SW-846for some constituents are higher than some of the promulgated treatmentstandards. This apparent anomaly results primarily from the fact that thePQLs in SW-846 were not based on testing the matrices that were testedin developing the treatment standards. The treatment standards for a givenwaste code, in contrast, are based on analytical testing of the residualsfrom the treatment of that waste (or in some cases, a similar waste fromwhich the treatment standards are transferred). Thus, the resulting treatmentstandards appropriately reflect the level of analytical performance achievablefor that waste.Other commenters questioned whether constraints posed by the limits ofapplicable analytic methods allow the treatment standards to be met ona reliable, routine basis. The Agency points out that the laboratoriesused in the development of the BDAT standards are themselves reliable andmust maintain compliance with all QA/QC requirements on a routine basis.Further, the background documents for all wastes for which incinerationhas been established as BDAT, indicate a consistency of the laboratoriesin obtaining low detection limits for the regulated constituents in thesewastes, thus providing additional support that these treatment standardsare achievable on a routine and reliable basis.In cases where a facility believes that particular, waste-specific treatmentstandards cannot be obtained due to the inability of their laboratory toachieve PQLs below the treatment standards on certain treatment residuals,the facility may submit a petition for a variance from those particulartreatment standards for that particular waste or wastes. In such a case,the facility must demonstrate that the analyses are in compliance withall other BDAT QA/QC provisions and that the treatment process is a well-designedand well-operated BDAT process. (As outlined in the BDAT Generic QualityAssurance Project Plan (EPA/530-SW-87-011, March 1987), the Agency mayalso use analytical methods for setting treatment standards that are notspecifically identified in SW-846, provided that the methods comply withall appropriate detection limits, spike/surrogate recoveries, and otherquality assurance criteria.)c.<T3> Restrictions on the use of technologies identified as BDAT. </T3>Allof the treatment standards expressed as concentrations of specific constituentsin the waste reflect performance achieved by the Best Demonstrated AvailableTechnology (BDAT). As such, compliance with these standards only requiresthat these concentrations (treatment levels) be achieved prior to landdisposal. The standard generally does not require or restrict the use ofany particular treatment technology to achieve these levels. The Agencyemphasizes that the technologies identified as BDAT (for those wastes withonly concentration-based standards) are simply those technologies thatEPA utilized to develop the waste specific concentration-based performancestandards. The waste need not be treated by that specific technology. Anytreatment, including recycling or any combination of treatment technologies,unless prohibited (such as impermissible dilution), can be used to achievethese concentration-based standards unless that technology is defined asland disposal (i.e., land treatment).Treatment standards promulgated today are expressed as numerical concentrationlevels, with a few exceptions. Because of difficulties associated withanalysis of specific constituents in wastes from the production of toluenediisocyanate (K027, K113, K114, K115, K116, U221 and U223) and certainorganophosphorus pesticides (K039, P040, P041, P043, P044, P062, P085,P109, P111, U058 and U087), some treatment standards in today's rule areexpressed as a technology rather than as a concentration-based standard(see sections III.A.3.(f.) and III.A.3.(h.)). In addition, treatment standardsfor K005 and K007 wastes that are generated from the process describedin the listing for these waste codes (rather than derived from residualsfrom prior disposal of these wastes) are expressed as ``No Land DisposalBased on No Generation'' (see section III.A.3.(c.)).In situations where wastes subject to concentration-based standards aremixed with wastes subject to treatment standards that are specified technologies,the mixture would have to be treated by the specified BDAT method, andwould have to meet the concentration-based treatment standards for anyother prohibited wastes that are contained in the matrix. See generally53 FR 31146-147 (August 17, 1988). It may not be appropriate to apply the specified technology to every mixturethat contains the waste subject to that technology. However, EPA has structuredthe final rule in a way that the technology specified as BDAT is likelyto be appropriate for the types of mixtures that are most likely to beencountered in the near term application of this rule. For example, EPA has specified incineration or fuel substitution as thetreatment technology for certain wastes prohibited by today's regulation.The most likely mixture for which these technologies might be inappropriateis contaminated soil and debris. In today's rule, however, EPA is grantinga two-year national capacity variance for soil and debris for those wasteswhere BDAT has been specified as incineration. Multi-source leachate mightalso be contaminated with these wastes, but EPA has deferred standardsfor such leachates until the Third Third. See 54 FR 8264 (February 27,1989). EPA also notes that in other situations it may be inappropriatefor multi-waste mixtures to be treated by the specified treatment methodswhich are demonstrated treated methods for most wastes that contain organiccontaminants. Given the lack of immediate applicability to soil and debrisand multi-source leachate, the Agency does not believe that there are mayother situations where the promulgated treatment standards would proveinappropriate. However for those situations, the treatability variancein 40 CFR 268.44 is available.d. <T3>Applicability of treatment standards to treatment residues identifiedas ``derived-from'' wastes. </T3>BDAT typically consists of a treatmentoperation, or series of operations, that generate additional waste residues.For example, the BDAT for K001 nonwastewaters is incineration followedby stabilization. (See 53 FR 31153 (August 17, 1988).) Incineration generatestwo residues that may require further treatment, namely ash and scrubberwaters. Treatment of scrubber waters to remove metals may generate additionalinorganic residues also requiring stabilization. Ultimately these additionalwastes (i.e., treatment residues) may be land disposed, so they must meetthe same standards as the stabilized ash. With respect to these additionalwastes, the Agency emphasizes that all residues from treating the originallisted waste are likewise considered to be the listed waste by virtue ofthe ``derived-from'' rule contained in 40 CFR 261.3(c)(2). Consequently,all wastes generated in the course of treatment are prohibited from landdisposal unless they comply with the treatment standard or are otherwiseexempted from the prohibition through a no-migration petition or by a capacityvariance.The Agency is, however, developing ``de minimis'' levels for certain hazardousconstituents in listed wastes below which the waste will no longer be ahazardous waste for purposes of Subtitle C regulation. At this time, EPAhas not proposed these ``de minimis'' levels. In addition, the Agency hasnot completed its evaluation of the regulations that would be impactedby these ``de minimis'' levels_in particular, their relationship to BDATtreatment standards.e. <T3>Transfer of treatment standards. </T3>Some treatment standards arenot based on testing the performance of BDAT on the specific waste subjectto the treatment standard. Rather, in certain instances, the Agency examinessimilarities in waste characteristics and constitutents and determineswhether the treatment standards can be transferred. EPA believes that transferringtreatment performance data to establish standards for untested wastes orconstitutents is technically valid when the untested wastes are generatedfrom similar industries and/or similar processing steps or when the constituentshave similar chemical and physical properties. Transfer of treatment standardsto wastes from similar processing steps involves relatively minimal amountof analysis because of the likelihood that the production processes willproduce a waste matrix with similar characteristics.In cases where only the industry is similar, EPA closely examines the wastecharacteristics prior to concluding that the untested waste constitutentscan be treated to levels associated with tested wastes. EPA reviews theavailable waste characteristic data to identify those parameters whichare expected to affect treatment selection. Some of the most importantconstitutents, as well as other parameters, are identified to facilitatethe selection of the appropriate treatment technology for a given waste.When the analysis suggests that the untested waste can be treated withthe same technology as a waste for which treatment performance data arealready available, a more detailed list of constituents is analyzed toidentify the most important waste characteristics which the Agency believeswill affect the performance of the technology. By examining and comparingthese characteristics, the Agency determines whether the untested wasteswill achieve the same level of treatment as the tested waste. Where theAgency determines that the untested waste can be treated to the same concentration-basedlevels as well as the tested waste, the treatment standards can be transferred.A detailed discussion of this transfer process can be found in the BDATbackground documents for each waste or waste treatability group.f. <T3>Treatment standards based on single facility data and grab samplesversus composite samples. </T3>As discussed previously in the August 17,1989 final rule for First Third wastes, the Agency believes that the useof a small number of data sets from a single treatment facility can berepresentative of the treatment achieved by the particular treatment system.This is particularly true when no other treatment data is available, orwhen data exist but there is no verification that the treatment processfrom which the data was obtained was well-designed or well-operated. Itis not possible for the Agency to sample every facility generating thewaste or every treatment system treating the waste. For the purposes ofdetermining BDAT treatment standards, the Agency has established a procedureand methodology for selecting particular facilities and treatment systemsthat it considers to be well-designed and well-oeprated (53 FR 31138).The Agency also selects wastes that are representative of those most difficultto treat.The Agency recognizes that there are certain variabilities inherent toevery treatment system as well as a certain amount of variability in thecharacteristics of the wastes. In the calculation of the treatment standards,the Agency accounts for these by multiplying the mean of the concentrationof the constituents to be regulated by a correction factor known as thevariability factor. This factor is derived utilizing a quantitative procedurethat determines the statistical 99th percentile for the treatment standard.This results in the establishment of a treatment standard that is believedto be achievable 99 percent of the time by a well-designed, well-operatedsystem.The Agency further accounts for variability due to analytical reproducibilityby adjusting the treatment standard for the analytical recovery data forconstituents. In addition, the Agency performs all analyses of hazardousconstituents used in the development of the treatment performance data,in accordance with an established quality assurance/quality control plan(as outlined in the BDAT Generic Quality Assurance Project Plan).Where performance data exist based on both the analysis of composite samplesand on the analysis of grab samples, the Agency establishes the treatmentstandards based on the analysis of grab samples. There are two principalreasons for this. It is normally easier and more expeditious for EPA toenforce on the basis of grab samples. In addition, grab samples normallyreflect maximum process variability, and thus would reasonably characterizethe ranges of treatment system performance.In cases where only composite data exist, the Agency considers the QA/QCof the data, the inherent efficiency of the process design, and the levelof performance achieved. The Agency may then choose to use this compositedata to develop the treatment standard. Where this data is used to establishthe treatment standard, the treatment standard is identified as based onanalysis of a composite sample. Enforcement of that standard thus wouldalso be based on composite samples.An individual facility's waste analysis plan will provide the basis forthat facility's compliance monitoring. This plan must be adequate to assurecompliance with Part 268. However, a facility remains strictly liable formeeting the treatment standards, so that if it disposes of a waste thatdoes not meet a treatment standard, it is in violation of the land disposalrestrictions regulations. If the facility complied with its waste analysisplan, it would not be in violation of the waste analysis plan provisions.Put another way, a waste analysis plan cannot immunize land disposal ofprohibited wastes, although such plans may be written to authorize typesof sampling and monitoring different from those used to develop the treatmentstandard(s).If a waste analysis plan were to authorize a different mode of samplingor monitoring, there would need to be a demonstration that the plan (andthe specific deviating feature) is adequate to assure compliance with Part268 (see 40 CFR 264.13(a)). This might require, for example, a demonstrationof statistical equivalence between a composite sampling protocol and onebased on grab sampling, or a demonstration of why monitoring for a subsetof pollutants would assure compliance of those not monitored. (EPA repeatsthat enforcement of the rule is based on the treatment standard, not thefacility's waste analysis plan, so that enforcement officials would normallytake grab samples and analyze for all constituents regulated by the applicabletreatment standards.)<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Second Third Wastes From Specific Sources for Which BDAT Standardsare not Promulgated in Today's Rule</ITAG>K019 and K025 wastes were originally scheduled to be examined as part ofthe Second Third rulemaking. However, EPA promulgated treatment standardsfor these wastes in the First Third final rule on August 8, 1988 (53 FR31155, 31156 and 31174 (August 17, 1988)). Concentration-based treatmentstandards, based on the performance of rotary kiln incineration, were promulgatedfor the wastewater and nonwastewater forms of K019 and a treatment standardof ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' was promulgated for nonwastewaterforms of K025. EPA recently amended the standard for K025 nonwastewatersso that it applies only to wastes generated from the process descriptionin the listing of K025 wastes and that are disposed after August 17, 1988.See 54 FR 18836 (May 2, 1989).EPA did not promulgate treatment standards for the K025 wastewaters onAugust 8, 1988. The ``soft hammer'' provisions, however, did not applybecause K025 wastes were originally scheduled in the Second Third. TheAgency is not promulgating treatment standards for these wastewaters intoday's rule (i.e., prior to their statutory deadline); therefore, landdisposal of K025 wastewaters is now restricted according to the ``softhammer'' provisions in 40 CFR 268.8. EPA is presenting this informationin today's preamble as a matter of convenience, in order to show treatmentstandards for all of the Second Third wastes. EPA did not reopen the commentperiod on the promulgated concentration-based treatment standards for K019wastes or on the promulgated ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''standards for K025 nonwastewaters.The Agency has not completed its evaluation of BDAT for Second Third wastesidentified as K029 wastewaters, K095 wastewaters, K096 wastewaters, nonwastewaterand wastewater forms of K041, K042, K097, K098, K105 as well as certainother Second Third wastes identified with a ``U'' or ``P'' waste code.Therefore, the Agency is not promulgating treatment standards for thesewastes in today's rule. Since the Agency is not promulgating standardsfor these Second Third wastes by their statutory deadline, land disposalof these wastes is regulated by the ``soft hammer'' provisions of 40 CFR268.8. The Agency believes that the majority of these ``soft hammer'' wastes,as generated, are nonwastewaters containing relatively high concentrationsof chlorinated organics. In addition, EPA believes that the majority ofthese wastes contain high enough concentrations of halogenated organics(greater than 0.1%), that they are already restricted from land disposalas Halogenated Organic Compounds (HOCs) under the California List Rule.Treatment standards for some wastewater or nonwastewater forms of otherSecond Third wastes have not been promulgated in today's rule. An explanationof each can be found in the discussion of treatment standards for the appropriatetreatability group in the ensuing section (III.A.3.) of today's preamble.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Treatment Standards and Responses to Major Comments for All WastesProposed With the Second Third Wastes</ITAG>This section of today's rule discusses treatment standards for all wastesand waste treatability groups proposed in the Second Third proposal. Thisincludes many of the Second Third wastes, some of the First Third wastesthat were, until today, regulated under the ``soft hammer'' provisions,and some Third Third wastes for which the Agency decided to promulgaterestrictions ahead of schedule. A more detailed explanation of the Agency'saction is found in relevant background documents and response to commentdocuments which are part of the administrative record to this rule.a. <T3>Cyanide wastes. </T3>Today's rule promulgates treatment standards formany wastewater and nonwastewater forms of RCRA hazardous wastes that containcyanides. Wastes containing cyanides are generated primarily by facilitiesperforming operations such as electroplating (generating F006, F007, F008and F009 wastes), heat treating (F010, F011 and F012), chemical conversioncoating of aluminum (F019), other metal finishing, and acrylonitrile production(K011, K013 and K014). Facilities in these industries as well as otherscan also generate cyanide wastes listed as P013, P021, P029, P030, P063,P074, P098, P099, P104, P106 and/or P121. Wastes designated with these``P'' codes are typically discarded, out-of-date, or off-specificationchemicals used by these industries. Detailed technical descriptions ofthe specific production processes generating these ``F'' and ``K'' wastesand background on the specific chemical represented by the ``P'' wastecodes can be found in the background documents for the listing of thesewastes.The same industries often generate other reactive cyanide wastes identifiedsimply as D003 wastes (as defined in 40 CFR 261.23(a)(5)). Today's rule,however, does not promulgate treatment standards for these D003 wastes.In the January 11, 1989 proposed rule, the Agency defined three subcategoriesof cyanide wastes from the metal finishing industry: Metal Finishing AqueousLiquids, Metal Finishing Organic Liquids, and Metal Finishing Sludges.The Agency has re-examined the need for these subcategories and believesthey are unnecessary for the establishment of separate treatment standards.Rather, the Agency has decided that presentation of the treatment standardson a waste code basis (according to the wastewater and nonwastewater formsof the waste) provides a significant distinction of the treatability groups.The treatment standards for all of these cyanide wastes are based on testingperformed by the Agency or on testing performed by the commercial hazardouswaste treatment industry. Additional performance data were submitted duringthe comment period. Analysis of these dates support the positions of manyof the commenters (as well as the Agency). EPA has determined that theuse of these data to promulgate revised treatment standards for many ofthe cyanide wastes is technically justified. The Agency provided noticeof these additional data (that provide the basis for many of the finaltreatment standards for cyanides) by sending a letter to all persons submittinginitial comments on the issue of cyanide treatability. This letter included:(1) A copy of the additional data on the treatment of cyanide that wasreceived by the Agency; (2) a notice of the anticipated changes in theappropriate treatment standards; and (3) a request for additional comments.All of this information, including the Agency's response to the additionalcomments, have been placed in the administrative record for today's rule.The treatment standards for total cyanides, amenable cyanides, and organics(i.e., those in K011, K013, and K014) were developed based on the performanceof destructive technologies such as alkaline chlorination, electrolyticoxidation, wet air oxidation and/or incineration. The treatment standardsfor metals are based on the performance of technologies such as hexavalentchromium reduction, lime or sulfide precipitation, filtration, and stabilization.Other treatment technologies that can achieve these concentration-basedtreatment standards are not precluded from use by this rule (see the detaileddiscussion on the use of alternative technologies in section III.A.1.(c)of today's rule). The specific regulated constituents and treatment standardsfor each waste code are listed in the tables at the end of such sectionaccording to the wastewater and nonwastewater forms of the waste.1. Comments with general applicability to cyanide wastes. This sectiondiscusses the Agency's response to those comments that pertain to all ormany of the cyanide wastes. This includes comments on the following: precisionof the analytical methods for amenable and total cyanides; establishmentof alkaline chlorination versus electrolytic oxidation as BDAT; the forcingof pretreatment by BDAT; effects of iron-cyanide complexes on cyanide treatability;potential stabilization of cyanides; and use of the TCLP for developmentof alternative leachable cyanide standards.i. Precision of analytical methods. Several commenters had serious reservationsregarding the precision and accuracy of the analysis for total and amenablecyanides in nonwastewaters. They pointed out that the reproducibility (i.e.,precision) of the analytical method for analyzing total cyanide in nonwastewaters(using the official test methods of the Office of Solid Waste i.e., EPAPublication SW-846) exceeded the proposed standard for amenable cyanidesin nonwastewaters. Analysis of amenable cyanide involves two measurementsof total cyanides, i.e., one analysis of total cyanide before and one aftera laboratory alkaline chlorination step. The Agency has re-examined thedata used to develop the treatment standards for amenable cyanides. Althoughthe Agency maintains the overall validity of these analytical methods,it agrees, in part, with the commenters that at certain levels of totalcyanides the reproducibility of the analytical method may indeed exceedthe standards for amenable cyanide as originally proposed. Thus, the Agencyhas recalculated the standards for amenable cyanides, and in doing so hastaken into account the reproducibility of the analytical method for totalcyanides. The standards presented in today's rule have been developed basedon these calculations. Details on the recalculation of the amenable cyanidestandards for each waste treatability group are provided in the backgrounddocument for cyanide wastes.ii. Alkaline chlorination versus electrolytic oxidation. Several commentersquestioned whether an electrolytic oxidation treatment system, typicallya batch process, could be implemented in a continuous wastewater treatmentprocess. The commenters explained that most electroplating job shops thatgenerate F006, F007, F008, and F009 wastes employ a continuous alkalinechlorination process as part of their wastewater treatment process. Thecommenters further stated that they could not possibly retrofit existingfacilities by June 8, 1989, the promulgation date of this rule.The commenters' point was addressed chiefly to F006 wastes. However, thecomment no longer has applicability for F006 wastes (nor for F007, F008or F009) because electrolytic oxidation is no longer the technology basisfor the final cyanide standards for these waste codes. Rather, for thesewastes, the promulgated BDAT treatment standards are based on the performanceof alkaline chlorination, without electrolytic oxidation.The Agency has determined that electrolytic oxidation is applicable primarilyas a pretreatment step, particularly when cyanide concentrations in theraw waste are quite high (several percent, at least). It is part of thebasis for final treatment standards only for waste codes F011 and F012nonwastewaters and certain discarded commercial chemical products (i.e.,those cyanide wastes identified with a ``P'').In addition, the Agency reemphasizes that where BDAT treatment standardsare expressed as concentration limits, it is not required to use technologiesidentified as BDAT. Other treatment technologies that can achieve theseconcentration-based standards are not precluded from use by this rule.Further discussion on the restrictions on the use of technologies identifiedas BDAT can be found in section III.A.1.(c.) of this rule.iii. Pretreatment standards. According to 40 CFR 261.31, F006, F012 andF019, wastes are specifically listed as wastewater treatment sludges (<T4>Note: </T4>at this time the Agency is not promulgating treatment standardsfor F019 wastes as discussed in section III.A.1.(c.)(4.)). Many commentersstated that by establishing treatment standards for cyanides in these wastes,the Agency is requiring pretreatment (of the cyanides) before the listedwaste is generated. They assert that the Agency lacks the authority totake such action under RCRA.EPA rejects the view that the statutory language of HSWA precludes theapproach adopted today. The statute requires EPA to establish treatmentstandards ``which substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantiallyreduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the waste* * *'' (section 3004(m)(1)). Alkaline chlorination of aqueous cyanidestreams is a standard method of treatment that destroys cyanides, and thussubstantially diminishes the toxicity of the wastewater treatment sludge,thereby satisfying this statutory requirement. In addition, Congress focusedspecifically on the treatment of cyanides in promulgating the 1984 amendmentsand indicated that ``[d]estruction of total cyanides should be requiredas a precondition to land disposal.'' 130 Cong. Rec. S 9179 (daily ed.July 25, 1984) (Statement of Senator Chaffee explaining the amendment whichbecame section 3004(m)). Cyanides in these wastes are customarily destroyedby treating aqueous wastestreams. Given the evident Congressional purposeof the land disposal restriction provisions, and the specific Congressionalintention (quoted above) that cyanides be destroyed, EPA believes thatCongress was not concerned whether cyanides were destroyed before or afterthe listed waste technically is generated, but rather was concerned withthe cyanide content in the waste when disposed. Consequently, it is reasonablefor the Agency to develop a standard which is achievable by treating cyanidesbefore the listed waste is generated. (EPA emphasizes, however, that cyanidetreatment does not require any change to the manufacturing process. Itmay in certain cases involve changes in treatment of wastewaters from themanufacturing processes.)Commenters also stated that the BDAT technology studied by the Agency wasnot based on the treatment of wastewater treatment sludges and that thetechnology could not be applied to F006, F012 or F019 after generationparticularly when the wastewater treatment processes included a dewateringstep. They asserted that after dewatering, the wastewater treatment sludgeshave high solid content (approximately 40-60%) and as a result, could notbe processed through the systems EPA determined to be BDAT. The Agencymaintains that the BDAT technologies can be applied prior to the dewateringstep or can be applied after dewatering by slurrying the waste with water.In this case, the dewatering step would probably only be performed in orderto reduce the volume of these wastes prior to transportation to a treatmentand disposal facility. Indeed, one of the commercial facilities that treatcyanide wastes informed EPA that some solid cyanide wastes were being dissolvedand slurried prior to treatment through the BDAT process (after which treatmentthey are able to meet the cyanide treatment standards). While the Agencydoes not believe that slurrying these wastes is necessarily the most cost-effectiveway to perform alkaline chlorination (or other cyanide treatment), thistreatment option remains available. In addition, generators of these sludgesneed not dewater them but rather may send the high water content sludgesto alkaline chlorination. In either of these situations, cyanide treatmentwould be performed on the listed waste itself.The Agency also points out that this ``pretreatment'' argument appearsacademic, in that many of the wastes and wastewaters entering the wastewatertreatment process that generate F006, F012 and F019 are already RCRA hazardouswastes or are mixed with hazardous wastes (such as F007, F008, F009, F010,and/or F011). In these situations, EPA would be applying treatment standardsto a cyanide-containing hazardous waste already generated, and in mostcases, the cyanide standard would be the same as for F006.In conclusion, the commenter's arguments regarding ``pretreatment'' appearartificial, and may have no practical consequences. The Agency maintainsthat these BDAT technologies are applicable to these wastes and thus ispromulgating the appropriate treatment standards for cyanides.iv. Treatment of iron-cyanide complexes. As stated in the proposed ruleand the proposed cyanide background document, the Agency believed thatthe F011 and F012 wastes that were treated by the Agency had similar chemicalcharacteristics as F006, F007, F008, F009, and F019 wastes, and thereforebelieved that the performance of the treatment system of electrolytic oxidationfollowed by alkaline chlorination could be transferred to these wastes.Many commenters stated that EPA's performance data for electrolytic oxidationfollowed by alkaline chlorination for total and amenable cyanide constituentsin F011 and F012 nonwastewaters could not be transferred to F006, F007,F008, F009 and F019 nonwastewaters because of the differences in the concentrationof iron-cyanide complexes. They stated that these complexes are more difficultto treat by conventional cyanide oxidation processes.Based on a re-examination of the chemical composition and waste characteristicsof these wastes, the Agency agrees with the commenters that the F006, F007,F008, F009 and F019 wastes have different waste treatability characteristicsthan the F011 and F012 wastes because of the iron-cyanide complexes. TheAgency believes that the source of the high iron concentration in thesewastes may be due to the fact that these wastes are generated from theelectroplating industry and that the material being plated is steel. Theiron contained in steel is replaced with the metal contained within theelectroplating baths (for example zinc in zinc cyanide plating baths).The iron that is thus released is believed to then react with the cyanideto form compounds that are referred to as iron-complex cyanides.Some iron in these wastes results, not from the plating process itself,but rather from other sources that are generated sporadically. These sourcesinclude: other metal finishing operations such as acid cleaning, descalingand pickling; the degradation of process tank linings or racks; or theintermingling of electroplating rinse water streams with other wastes withhigh iron content.) It is possible that these sources of iron can be avoidedby implementing waste audits and by application of simple source reductiontechniques such as proper equipment maintenance, segregation of high ironwaste streams, and substitution of pickling/descaling acids. Because theprincipal source of iron appears to be the steel plating process itself,however, EPA views this as an intrinsic characteristic of the electroplatingwastewaters that needs to be taken into account in assessing the treatabilityof F006, F007, F008 and F009 wastes.The Agency agrees that the high concentrations of iron in the cyanide wastes(when present as iron-cyanide complexes) appear to effect the level ofcyanide destruction that is achievable (i.e., they appear to be more difficultto treat). Data also indicate that some F006, F007, F008 and F009 wastescontaining low concentrations of iron (or no iron) appear to be treatableto lower cyanide concentrations than those with high iron. At this time,however, the Agency has not determined a specific concentration of ironin these wastes that would indicate a difference in treatability for thecyanides (i.e., a separate treatability group for F006, F007, F008 andF009 wastes containing low iron), and thus promulgated a higher total cyanidetreatment standard of 590 mg/kg for all F006, F007, F008 and F009 wastesbased on the new data provided by industry (that included wastes treatmentperformance data on wastes with high iron content).Where the Agency could determine that specific cyanide waste codes (i.e.,F011, F012, P013, P021, P029, P030, P063, P074, P098, P099, P104, P106,and P121) normally contain relatively low concentrations of iron, the Agencypromulgated the proposed total cyanide treatment standard of 110 mg/kg.Other commenters further stated that not only are the F006, F007, F008,and F009 wastes and F011 and F012 wastes different in waste characteristics(such as iron content) but also in the type of metal finishing processesthat generate these wastes. The F006, F007, F008, and F009 wastes are generatedfrom the electroplating process and the F011 and F012 wastes are generatedfrom a heat treating process. The commenters stated that electroplatershave pretreatment requirements for NPDES permits for total and amenablecyanides and that heat treaters are not subject to the same requirements.Since alkaline chlorination is also the technology basis for most of thecyanide treatment standards in today's rule, there is no inconsistencyin the approach between the Clean Water Act limitations and standards andthe treatment standards adopted in today's rule. (As noted elsewhere, existingdata show that the great majority of generators are meeting the F006 treatmentstandards for cyanides with their existing wastewater treatment technology.)Clean Water Act effluent limitations and standards could technically beachieved by adding reagents such as ferrous sulfate to the wastewaters.EPA, however, did not base the NPDES and pretreatment standards on precipitationwith ferrous sulfate but rather on alkaline chlorination to destroy cyanidesand hydroxide precipitation to remove metals. If a company chooses to precipitatewith ferrous sulfate, there is an increase in concentration of the iron-cyanidecomplexes that results in an increase of the measured total cyanide concentrationin the sludge (i.e., nonwastewaters) generated from the wastewater treatment.The Agency maintains that, in most cases, this type of addition of ferrousions can be eliminated through proper design and operation of the existingonsite cyanide destruction technologies without significantly impactingthe achievement of the NPDES effluent limitations on cyanides.By reducing the concentration of iron-cyanide complexes that end up inthe wastewater treatment sludges, the potential for release of toxic cyanidesfrom land disposal units is reduced. This is entirely consistent with theCongressional intent with respect to the destruction of cyanide. (See furtherdiscussion in section III.A.3.(a.)(1.)(vi.) of today's rule.)v. <T3>Stabilization of cyanides. </T3>Several commenters stated that theAgency should consider stabilization as an effective technology for thetreatment of cyanides. Commenters also stated that the Agency did not provideany stabilization data in the background document or the administrativerecord. At the time of proposal, the Agency had not reviewed any performancedata for stabilization that meet the QA/QC requirements for determiningBDAT. During the comment period, the Agency had an opportunity to reviewsome stabilization data that was generated by both the Agency and industry.(This data appears in the final background document for cyanide wastesand has been placed in the administrative record.) The Agency does not agree with commenters that stabilization is an applicabletechnology for the treatment of the majority of cyanide wastes. While somedata may indicate that stabilization processes appear to reduce the leachabilityof some forms of cyanide, the Agency contends that destruction of cyanideis clearly a preferred treatment method (as further discussed in sectionIII.A.3.a.1.vi. of today's rule). The Agency believes that the majorityof commercially available conventional stabilization technologies are primarilydesigned to stabilize cationic species (such as many of the BDAT list metals)and are not specifically designed for anionic species (such as cyanide).The Agency believes that the presence of certain metal complex cyanidesmay appear to give the effect of ``stabilization'' due to the low solubilityof these cyanide complexes. The Agency believes that the extrapolationof stabilization data on wastes containing complexed cyanides could leadto erroneous assumptions on the ability of cyanides that are somewhat moresoluble to be ``stabilized''. In addition, solitary use of treatment processesthat convert the soluble cyanides present in the wastes to a less solublestate (i.e., complexed cyanides) for purposes of stabilization does notprovide an overall reduction in toxicity. (See following discussion ofleachable cyanides.)vi. Use of the TCLP for leachable cyanide. Many commenters stated thatthe Agency should develop treatment standards for cyanides based on a leachablelevel of cyanide as opposed to a total cyanide level. The Agency has reviewedthe data submitted by commenters on the level of leachable cyanides andthe analysis of the data appears in the background document for cyanidewastes and in the administrative record for today's rule. The Agency stronglydisagrees with the commenters that the cyanide treatment standards shouldbe based on leachable levels. The Agency believes that the legislativehistory to RCRA section 3004(m) indicates that Congress intended that the``destruction of total cyanides would be required as a precondition toland disposal'' (130 Congressional Record S9179, July 25, 1984, statementof Senator Chafee).The treatment standards for cyanides are based on a total waste analysisfor two reasons. First, the Agency believes that by only regulating theleachable cyanide concentration, the complex-metal cyanides that are presentin the wastes would not be regulated. Second, based on the review of theavailable treatment data, the Agency believes that the conventional cyanidetreatment technologies provide substantial treatment of both the amenableand total cyanide concentration as measured by the Cyanide Amenable toChlorination test in Method 9010 (EPA Publication SW-846).Finally, the Agency believes that there is a real potential for the complexedcyanides that are present in these wastes to at least partially degradeinto the more toxic form of cyanides known as ``free'' cyanides. This processis anticipated to result from exposure to ultraviolet light (from sunlight)when the wastes are placed into certain land disposal units such as a surfaceimpoundment. This is consistent with the Agency's approach to establishingeffluent guideline limitations for total cyanides in wastewater dischargesfrom these same metal finishing industries.In today's rule, the Agency is promulgating a total cyanide standard forF006, F007, F008, and F009 nonwastewaters as 590 mg/kg. This standard ishigher than the proposed standard of 110 mg/kg and thereby allows for anoverall higher concentration of iron cyanide complexes to be present inthe nonwastewaters. At the same time, based on the same performance data,the total cyanide standard for wastewaters has been reduced from 12 mg/lto 1.9 mg/l and the amenable cyanide standard for wastewaters has beenreduced from 1.3 mg/l to 0.10 mg/l. Since the complexed cyanides presentin wastewaters are more likely to be subject to photodegradation to ``free''cyanide than those in the nonwastewaters, the Agency believes that theserevised total and amenable cyanide standards promulgated in today's ruleprovide a significant overall reduction in potential toxicity from thephotodegradation of iron-cyanide complexes.2. Wastes from electroplating operations <ITAG tagnum="15">F006_Wastewater treatment sludges from electroplating operations exceptfrom the following processes: (1) Sulfuric acid anodizing of aluminum;(2) tin plating on carbon steel; (3) zinc plating (segregated basis) oncarbon steel; (4) aluminum or zinc-aluminum plating on carbon steel; (5)cleaning/stripping associated with tin, zinc and aluminum plating on carbonsteel; and (6) chemical etching and milling of aluminum. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">F007_Spent cyanide plating bath solutions from electroplating operations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">F008_Plating bath sludges from the bottom of plating baths from theelectroplating operations where cyanides are used in the process. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">F009_Spent stripping and cleaning bath solutions from electroplatingoperations where cyanides are used in the process. </ITAG>Today's rule promulgates treatment standards for amenable and total cyanidesin F006 nonwastewaters, and for amenable cyanides, total cyanides, andmetal constituents in F007, F008, and F009 nonwastewaters and wastewaters.BDAT treatment standards for the nonwastewaters are based on the performanceof alkaline chlorination for the amenable and total cyanides and stabilizationfor the metal constituents. BDAT treatment standards for the wastewatersare based on the performance of alkaline chlorination for the amenableand total cyanides and chemical precipitation followed by settling andfiltration for the metals. i. Nonwastewaters. In the January 11, 1989 proposed rule (54 FR 1066-1071),the Agency proposed nonwastewater treatment standards based on the performanceof electrolytic oxidation followed by alkaline chlorination for amenableand total cyanides. The Agency received comments that questioned whetherthe performance of electrolytic oxidation is considered demonstrated becauseof the limited number of data points. The Agency maintains that the useof a small number of data points from a single facility can be representativeof the treatment achieved by any particular treatment system (such as thosedata from electrolytic oxidation). However, the Agency has received a significantamount of new data on alkaline chlorination that form the basis for thecyanide treatment standards for F006, F007, F008 and F009 wastes promulgatedin today's rule. The Agency also received extensive comments that questioned the devisabilityof the proposed standards. In particular, many commenters stated that performancedata for F011 and F012 wastes (based on electrolytic oxidation followedby alkaline chlorination) should not be transferred to F006, F007, F008,F009 wastes because of the differences in concentration of iron-cyanidecomplexes in these wastes. (See section III.A.3.(a.)(1.)(iv.) for a morecomplete discussion of the Agency's position on the treatment of iron-cyanidecomplexes). The Agency agrees with the commenters that a sufficient numberof F006, F007, F008 and F009 electroplating wastes have different treatablitycharacteristics (i.e., high iron concentration) than F011 and F012 wastes,and that the proposed transfer of the treatment standards is no longerwarranted. Therefore, the Agency is promulgating revised cyanide treatmentstandards based on the new alkaline chlorination performance data receivedby the Agency during the comment period. (This data appeared as part ofthe record for the proposed rule and is also part of the administrativerecord for this final rule. See further discussion of how the Agency noticedthis data and solicited additional comment in the introduction to sectionIII.A.3.(a.) of today's preamble.) In supplemental comments on this new data, certain commenters questionedthe devisability of the revised treatment standard of 590 mg/kg for totalcyanide in nonwastewaters. (The proposed standard was 110 mg/kg.) Theyreiterated their previous argument that this standard was only representativeof the treatment of wastewaters and not representative of the treatmentof F006 as generated. In addition, they stated that the revised standardwas based on insufficient operating data. Some commenters also indicatedthat some of their F006 wastes (as generated) would not be able to meeteven the revised standard for total cyanides. EPA is responding in detail to both the initial comments to the proposedrule and these additional comments in the background document for cyanidewastes and in the response to comments background document, and will addressa few of the major points in today's preamble. First, the treatment standardis based on one month of operating data (14 data points) which the Agencyhas examined carefully and believes (based on detailed descriptions ofthe treatment process plus descriptions of sampling and analysis data)represent a well-designed and well-operated treatment process and thatrepresent BDAT treatment for F006, F007, F008 and F009 wastes. Second, although not all of the data came from treating F006 wastes (infact, treatment was performed during a one month period on RCRA wastesidentified as F006, F007, F008, F009, F011, F012, D002, D003, P029, P030and P106), the waste mixtures that were treated should be more difficultto treat than segregated F006 wastes. This is because the mixtures of theseRCRA wastes contained roughly an order of magnitude more iron and cyanideand greater concentrations of the minor complexing metals, nickel, zinc,and copper than typical F006 precursor wastewaters from electroplating(based on a review of the data used to develop the effluent guidelineslimitations for cyanides from the metal finishing industries). Third, with respect to the devisability of the revised standards, the Agencypoints out that most of the treatment and waste characterization data submittedto the Agency corroborates that the 590 mg/kg standard for total cyanideis achievable. Over 90 percent of the waste characterization data for F006sludges reported to the Agency in comments to the proposed rule (submittedby both the affected industry and treatment facilities alike) meet thepromulgated standard for total cyanides in F006 nonwastewaters. Not onlydo these comments confirm the ultimate standard's devisability, but alsoimply generators do not need to make significant modifications in theircurrent treatment processes in order to meet the standard. In addition, EPA reviewed treatment and waste characterization data containedin over 1500 individual facility's responses submitted to the Agency aspart of the 1986 Treatment Storage, Disposal and Recycling Survey and the1986 Generator Survey (which responses were selected by EPA from generatorsgenerating the largest volumes of F006 wastes). Again, these responsescorroborated the standard's devisability (plus the lack of need to modifyexisting treatment processes). The responses EPA reviewed showed that over90 percent of the F006 wastewater treatment sludges generated containedless than the 590 mg/kg total cyanide treatment standard required as aresult of today's rule. That is, treatment performed with existing treatmenttechnology before imposition of treatment standards for cyanides in wastewatertreatment sludge indicate that over 90 percent of facilities are alreadyachieving the standard. The Agency believes that these data show that mostof the industry is capable of meeting the total cyanide standard throughproper operation of the treatment technology that is already in place atthe generators' facilities. Further, for those few instances where commenters claimed to be unableto meet the 590 mg/kg standard, they provided no information on the circumstancesof treatment or generation, leaving the Agency no means of ascertainingwhy the cyanide standards promulgated in today's rule were not achievable.In short, EPA believes there is ample support for stating that the totalcyanide standard for F006, F007, F008 and F009 nonwastewaters promulgatedin today's rule is achievable.The standards for amenable cyanides in the nonwastewater forms of F006,F007, F008 and F009 reflect the limits of precision of the analytical methodfor cyanides amenable to chlorination (so that the amenable cyanide isapproximately 5 percent of the standard for total cyanides). EPA believesthat properly conducted alkaline chlorination actually destroys free cyanidesto a greater extent, but that it is difficult to measure amenable cyanidesin nonwastewaters. No commenter suggested that a free cyanide standardof 30 mg/kg was not achievable for these nonwastewaters.The Agency is promulgating treatment standards for the metal constituentsin F007, F008, and F009 nonwastewaters, based on the transfer of performancedata from the stabilization of F006 wastes. (The metal standards for F006nonwastewaters were promulgated in the First Third final rule (see 53 FR31152-31153) and are not being revised in today's rule.) The Agency receivedno comments or data refuting this transfer.ii. Wastewaters. Today's rule promulgates revised treatment standards foramenable and total cyanides and metal constituents in F007, F008, and F009wastewaters. In the January 11, 1989 proposed rule (54 FR 1066-1071), EPAproposed treatment standards based on performance of wet air oxidationfor cyanides, and chemical precipitation followed by settling and filtrationfor metals.Many commenters expressed concerns that the data base used by the Agencyto establish treatment standards for cyanide were limited. They thereforequestioned whether wet air oxidation is a demonstrated technology. However,the issue is essentially moot for these waste codes because during thecomment period the Agency received cyanide treatment data for F007, F008,and F009 wastewaters based on the performance of alkaline chlorination.EPA performed a statistical comparison of wet air oxidation and alkalinechlorination and found that there is a statistical difference between thetwo technologies for cyanides. The Agency determined that alkaline chlorinationtechnology performs better than wet air oxidation for these particularwastes based on a comparison of the available data. Therefore, the Agencyis promulgating revised wastewater treatment standards for cyanides toreflect BDAT as alkaline chlorination.These data (which substantially expand the treatment data base for thesewastewaters) also indicate that the standard for these wastewaters shouldbe decreased from the proposed level to 1.9 mg/l total cyanide and 0.10mg/l amenable cyanide (from 12 mg/l and 1.3 mg/l respectively). These standardsare more similar to the promulgated effluent guidelines limitations andstandards for the metal finishing industries. Commenters, in fact, raisedno significant challenges to EPA's solicitation to lower the wastewaterstandard for these wastes.The Agency is promulgating the wastewater treatment standards for metalsin F007, F008, and F009 based on the transfer of the treatment performancedata for chemical precipitation, settling, filtration and sludge dewateringfor K062 wastes. The Agency believes that the K062 wastewaters are moredifficult to treat than F007, F008, and F009 wastewaters based on the higherconcentrations of dissolved metals in K062 (up to 100,000 mg/l).The Agency is not promulgating the treatment standards for total and amenablecyanide in F006 wastewaters at this time. Concentration-based treatmentstandards for cyanides and metal constituents in the F006 wastewaters willbe promulgated by May 8, 1990. It is likely that the total and amenablecyanide treatment standard for the F006 wastewaters will be based on adata transfer from the performance of alkaline chlorination for the F007,F008, and F009 wastewaters. It is likely that the metal treatment standardswill be based upon information available from EPA's effluent limitationsguidelines and standards program. Since no treatment standards are promulgatedin today's rule for F006 wastewaters, these wastes continue to be subjectto the ``soft hammer'' provisions of 40 CFR 268.8.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,12,7</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F</T4>006<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l) </H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>590 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>30 </D><D>(\1\)</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F007, F008 and F009</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>590 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>30 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.066</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>(\1\) </D><D>5.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.51</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.072</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,9.2,3.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F007, F008 and F009</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>1.9 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>0.10 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>0.32 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.04 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.44 </D><D>(\1\)</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>3.

Treatment standards for total cyanide in F010 nonwastewatersare based on the performance of incineration. Treatment standards for F011and F012 nonwastewaters are based on the performance of electrolytic oxidationfollowed by alkaline chlorination for amenable and total cyanides, andbased on the performance of stabilization for the metal constituents. Treatmentstandards for amenable and total cyanide in F010, F011 and F012 wastewatersare based on the performance of alkaline chlorination. Treatment standardsfor metals in F011 and F012 wastewaters are based on the performance ofchemical precipitation, settling, and filtration. Other technologies thatcan achieve these concentration-based treatment standards are not precludedfrom use by this rule.EPA notes that the technology basis for treating cyanides in the wastewatersfrom F010, F011 and F012 differ from the technology basis for treatmentof the corresponding nonwastewaters. EPA, however, expects that the technologyused to treat the cyanides in the nonwastewaters will achieve the standardspromulgated for the wastewaters.Thus, EPA expects that if an F010 waste is incinerated, then the F010 scrubberwater that may be generated as a residue from incineration will not needfurther treatment for cyanides because they will already meet the promulgatedtreatment standards. If any F010 wastewaters are generated by a processother than incineration and they do not meet the treatment standards, thenit would be reasonable to treat these wastewaters with alkaline chlorinationrather than incineration.In a similar manner, wastewaters generated from the treatment of F011 orF012 nonwastewaters using electrolytic oxidation followed by alkaline chlorinationare not expected to need further treatment for cyanides because the Agencybelieves that these wastewaters will also already meet the promulgatedstandards. However, if any F011 or F012 wastewaters are generated by anothertreatment technology and do not meet the treatment standards as generated,it would also be reasonable to treat these wastewaters with alkaline chlorinationalone rather than electrolytic oxidation followed by alkaline chlorination.(Electrolytic oxidation is applicable primarily as a pretreatment step,particularly when cyanide concentrations in the raw waste are quite high.)i. Standards for F010 wastes. In the January 11, 1989 proposed rule, theAgency proposed a treatment standard for total cyanide in F010 nonwastewatersbased on BDAT as incineration. Also, EPA indicated that these wastes couldcontain up to 5 percent oil and grease content and can exist as a bi-layeredwaste, i.e. organic and aqueous layer. Based on conversations with thetreaters of this waste, the Agency believes that the F010 wastes can beseparated into an organic layer and an aqueous layer. This F010 organiclayer is what is typically incinerated, while the F010 aqueous layer canbe treated by conventional cyanide treatment rather than incineration.At the time of the proposal, the Agency had not examined the efficiencyof this separation process, and so proposed standards for all F010 nonwastewatersbased on the incineration of the wastes.Also, in the proposal, the Agency did not clarify what the treatment standardswould be for F010 nonwastewaters that could be generated from the alkalinechlorination treatment of the separated aqueous layer (an F010 wastewater).During the comment period, the Agency received no comments (or data) indicatingthe efficiency of the separation of the layers or whether the proposedtreatment standard (based on incineration) could be met.In this rule, the Agency is clarifying its position on the treatment standardsfor the F010 nonwastewaters that might be generated from treating a separatedF010 aqueous layer or other F010 wastewaters. As a point of clarification,the Agency first notes that treatment residues from treating F010 wastewatersare listed under the F012 waste code (wastewater treatment sludge frommetal heat treating operation) and would therefore be subject to the cyanidestandards for F012 nonwastewaters. Such sludges would therefore not besubject to the standards based on performance of incineration. With respectto F010 wastewaters, the Agency believes that aqueous F010 wastewatershave similar waste characteristics to F011 and F012 wastewaters. The Agencyis therefore transferring the performance of the treatment system of alkalinechlorination for the cyanide constituents (based on the new data obtainedon alkaline chlorination during the comment period). See the followingdiscussion of treatment standards for F011 and F012 wastewaters. Therefore,the treatment standards for amenable cyanides and total cyanides in F010wastewaters are 0.10 mg/l and 1.9 mg/l respectively. The promulgated treatmentstandard for residues from the incineration of the F010 organic layer (i.e.,F010 nonwastewaters high in organics) is 1.5 mg/kg, the same standard thatEPA proposed. The Agency notes that if a generator or treater of a F010wastes does not separate the waste into the two layers, that facility wouldhave to meet the 1.5 mg/kg treatment standard for total cyanides in thenonwastewater residuals (based on incineration).The Agency did not propose treatment standards for any metals containedn F010 wastewaters or nonwastewaters. At the time, the Agency had no wastecharacterization data that indicated the presence of hazardous metals inthe untreated wastes. In addition, the Agency received no comments or dataindicating that metals were present in these wastes. As a result, the Agencyis promulgating only the treatment standards for cyanides contained inF010 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. This does not preclude the Agencyfrom proposing the regulation of metals in these wastes if any F010 wastecharacterization data or treatment performance data become available.ii. Standards for F011 and F012 wastes. The treatment standards proposedon January 11, 1989, for F011 and F012 nonwastewaters were based on theperformance of electrolytic oxidation followed by alkaline chlorinationfor the cyanides (both total and amenable) and stabilization for the metalconstituents. The Agency is not basing treatment standards for these wasteson the new alkaline chlorination data used to establish standards for F006,F007, F008 and F009 wastes. The treatment standards for F011 and F012 wastesare thus substantially lower than those for the other waste codes. TheAgency believes that this is appropiate not only because of the existingperformance data supporting the lower standard, but because these wastesdo not have the treatability characteristics (i.e., high iron concentrations)that justify the higher standards for F006, F007, F008, and F009 nonwastewaters.The Agency is promulgating a total cyanide standard of 100 mg/kg and anamenable cyanide standard of 9.1 mg/kg for F011 and F012 nonwastewaters.The amenable cyanide standard is based on measured concentrations of amenablecyanides in F011 and F012 treatment residuals rather than based only onthe reproducibility of the analytic method for total cyanides.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>(Note.</T4>_The Agency used the reproducibility of the analysis fortotal cyanides to establish the amenable cyanide standards for F006, F007,F008 and F009 nonwastewaters because the data indicated that the amenablecyanides could be reduced to below the reproducibility of the analysisfor total cyanides. The treatment data indicated that this was not thecase for F011 and F012 wastes.)</ITAG>Two commenters believed that the calculation of the variability factorfor the total cyanide treatment standard (100 mg/kg) for these wastes wasincorrect. The Agency disagrees with the commenters. The calculation ofa variability factor for two data points is based on the standard deviationand the mean. EPA uses the two data points as the limits on lognormal distribution.Based on this information, the calculated variability factor is 1.58. Thus,the variability factor multiplied by the mean of the two data points representsthe treatment standard. The calculation of these standards is further clarifiedand presented in the final background document for cyanide wastes and theadministrative record for this rule. The Agency received extensive comments on its use of only two data pointsto establish the treatment standards for cyanides based on the performanceof electrolytic oxidation followed by alkaline chlorination. As discussedpreviously in section III.A.1.(f.) of today's rule and in the August 17,1989 final rule for First Third wastes, the Agency believes that the useof a small number of data sets from a single facility can be representativeof the treatment achieved by the particular treatment system. EPA has amandatory duty to issue standards on a very tight timetable, and automaticconsequences occur should the Agency fail to act. Under these circumstances,EPA must base standards on the best data available to it, even if the datais limited. If better sources of data were made available, EPA would makeevery effort to use them (as has occurred with a number of wastes in thisrulemaking, such as in the development of standards for the organophosphoruswaste treatability group as discussed in section III.A.3.(h.) of today'spreamble). Therefore, the Agency is promulgating the final standard basedon the information available. For F012 nonwastewaters (as with F006), many commenters stated that theAgency is requiring a pretreatment for the cyanides before the hazardouswaste (as listed) is actually generated. The Agency has responded to thisissue on pretreatment in detail in section III.A.3.(a.)(1.)(a)(iii.) oftoday's preamble. The proposed treatment standards for F011 and F012 wastewaters were basedon the performances of wet air oxidation for the cyanides and chemicalprecipitation, settling, and filtration for the metal constituents. Duringthe comment period the Agency received performance data for the treatmentof cyanides in wastewaters by alkaline chlorination. EPA performed a statisticalcomparison of the data from wet air oxidation and the new data from alkalinechlorination and found that alkaline chlorination performed better. Therefore,EPA is promulgating revised treatment standards for total and amenablecyanides for F011 and F012 wastewaters based on these new data and is transferringthese standards to F010 wastewaters as previously discussed. The Agency is promulgating the metal standards for F011 and F012 nonwastewatersbased on the transfer of the treatment performance data for chemical precipitation,settling, filtration and sludge dewatering for K062 wastes. The Agencybelieves that the K062 wastes are more difficult to treat than the residuesfrom treatment of F011 and F012 based on the higher concentrations of dissolvedmetals in K062 (up to 100,000 mg/l). <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F010 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constitutent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>1.5 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,9.2,3.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F010 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constitutent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>1.9 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>0.10 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,9.2,3.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F011 and F012 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constitutent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>110 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>9.1 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.066 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>(\1\) </D><D>5.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.51 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.32 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.072 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,9.2,3.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F011 and F012 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constitutent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>1.9 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>0.10 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>0.32 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.04 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.44 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="81">4. F019 wastes. </ITAG>F019_Wastewater treatment sludges from the chemical conversion coatingof aluminum. Today's rule does not promulgate treatment standards for the wastewateror nonwastewater forms of F019. This waste was originally scheduled forregulation in the First Third, with the statutory deadline of August 8,1988. Since the Agency did not promulgate standards for the wastewateror nonwastewater forms of F019, land disposal of these wastes shall continueto be regulated by the ``soft hammer'' provisions in 40 CFR 268.8. EPAintends to promulgate concentration-based treatment standards for cyanidesand metals constituents in F019 wastes by May 8, 1990. The Agency believes that F019 wastes are in a different treatability groupthan F006, F007, F008, and F009 electroplating wastes or F010, F011, andF012 heat treating wastes due to the very high concentration of iron-cyanidecomplexes in both the wastewaters and nonwastewaters. These iron levelsare significantly higher than those found in F006 wastewater precursors,and higher than any of the wastes used to establish BDAT for the electroplatingwastes. The Agency believes that the source of the iron-cyanide complexesis the soluble ferrocyanide compounds (such as potassium ferrocyanide)that are used as constituents in aluminum conversion coating compoundsor baths. Therefore, the cyanides present in these conversion coating bathswould be the iron-cyanide complexes which are used as a component of thecoating. The Agency believes that F019 nonwastewaters or the wastewatertreated to generate this waste have substantial concentrations of iron-cyanidecomplexes. The Agency believes that the source of iron for the F019 wasteis a legitimate source of iron and that F019 wastes represent a separatetreatability group of cyanide wastes. The Agency is investigating ultraviolet/ozonation, wet air oxidation, hydrolysisand incineration as potential candidates for BDAT. Recovery or reuse ofthe wastes containing iron-cyanide complexes is also being considered.In the interim, the ``soft hammer'' provisions continue to apply to theland disposal of F019 wastes. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Wastes from Acrylonitrile Production. </ITAG>K011_Bottom stream from the wastewater stripper in the production of acrylonitrile.K013_Bottom stream from the acetonitrile column in the production of acrylonitrile.K014_Bottoms from the acetonitrile purification column in the productionof acrylonitrile. Wastes identified as K011, K013, and K014 are generated primarily in theorganic chemicals manufacturing industry, specifically those engaged inthe production of acrylonitrile. Detailed technical descriptions of thespecific production processes generating these wastes can be found in thefinal background document for these wastes. Today's rule promulgates treatment standards for K011, K013, and K014 nonwastewatersbased on the performance of incineration. Other treatment technologiesthat can achieve these concentration-based standards, such as wet air oxidation,are not precluded from use by this rule. EPA is promulgating treatmentstandards for four organic constituents and for total cyanide. At thistime the Agency is not promulgating any standards for K011, K013, or K014wastewaters. The specific regulated constituents and treatment standardsfor these wastes are listed in tables at the end of this section. i. <T3>Nonwastewaters.</T3> In the January 11, 1989 proposed rule (54 FR 1066-1071),the Agency proposed treatment standards for nonwastewaters based on theperformance of incineration for total cyanide and organics and stabilizationfor the metal constituents, specifically nickel. Several commenters argued against developing a treatment standard for nickelbecause, based on waste characterization data, nickel was not present insignificant concentrations in the raw waste. Commenters also stated thatthe presence of certain constituents (e.g., sulfates and ammonia) wouldmake the removal of nickel from wastewaters, and the stabilization of nickelin the sludge and ash, much more difficult than the Agency has estimated,thereby making the BDAT treatment standards unachievable. The Agency has concluded, based on extensive review of existing data, thatnickel is not present in concentrations that would merit regulation aspart of the K011, K013, and K014 treatment standards, and therefore isremoving nickel from the list of regulated constituents for K011, K013,and K014 nonwastewaters. If additional treatment performance data for nickelbecomes available, the Agency is not precluded from regulating nickel asa nonwastewater treatment standard for K011, K013, and K014 wastes. Asa result of this determination, the Agency is revising its BDAT treatmentstandards for K011, K013, and K014 nonwastewaters to be based solely onthe performance of incineration. ii. <T3>Wastewaters. </T3>In the January 11, 1989 proposed rule (54 FR 1066-1071),the Agency proposed wastewater treatment standards based on the performanceof wet air oxidation followed by biological treatment for amenable cyanides,total cyanides, and organic constituents, and chemical precipitation, settling,and filtration for metal constituents. The Agency received many commentsconcerned with EPA's rationale for transferring performance data for thecyanide constituents from wet air oxidation of F007 wastes, and for organicconstituents from the effluent limitations for facilities in the OrganicChemical Plastics and Synthetic Fibers (OCPSF) industry for biologicaltreatment. Because of these comments and the additional treatment datathat are being compiled by the Ad Hoc Acrylonitrile Producers UIC Group,the Agency believes that additional data collection and analysis is necessaryprior to promulgation of these treatment standards.Therefore, today's rule does not promulgate treatment standards for thewastewater forms of K011, K013 and K014. These wastes were originally scheduledfor regulation in the First Third, with a statutory deadline of August8, 1988. Since the Agency still has not promulgated standards for the wastewaterforms of K011, K013 and K014, land disposal of these wastewaters shallcontinue to be regulated by the ``soft hammer'' provisions in 40 CFR 268.8.EPA intends to promulgate concentration-based treatment standards for cyanides,organics, and metals constituents for these wastes prior to May 8, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,9.2,3.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K011, K013, and K014 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Acetonitrile <D>1.8 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acrylonitrile <D>1.4 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acrylamide <D>23. </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene <D>0.03 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Total) <D>57. </D><D>(\1\)</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>6.

Facilities in industries such as electroplating, heat treating,chemical conversion coating of aluminum, and acrylonitrile production typicallygenerate these wastes.P013, P021, P099, and P121 and Third Third wastes that were originallyscheduled to be regulated no later than May 8, 1990. Several commentersopposed accelerating the schedule for these wastes. However, the statutedoes not preclude EPA from prohibiting the land disposal of a given wasteahead of schedule (and the schedule in andSection;andSection; 268.10 through268.12 itself says that wastes will be evaluated by a given date, indicatingthat the specified date is the latest time by which EPA must act). TheAgency believes that this is a particularly prudent approach for P013,P021, P099, and P121 because these wastes are not only generated, but aresimilar to F011 and F012 wastes from the heat treating industry.Today's rule promulgates concentration-based treatment standards for wastewaterand nonwastewater forms of these wastes. BDAT for the nonwastewater formsof these wastes is based on the performance of electrolytic oxidation followedby alkaline chlorination for the cyanide constituents, and stabilizationfor the metal constituents. BDAT for the wastewater forms of these wastesis based on the performance of alkaline chlorination for the cyanide constituentsand chemical precipitation, settling, and filtration for the metal constituents(where regulated). Treatment standards for these wastes were transferredfrom the performance of the BDAT for the F011 and F012 waste codes generatedfrom heat treating operations. These discarded commercial chemical productsdo not contain high concentrations of iron and therefore the Agency believesthat the treatment standards need not reflect the difficulties of treatingcomplex cyanides. The Agency is thus promulgating these concentration-basedtreatment standards in this section due to the similarity of these ``P''wastes to the listed metal heat treating wastes.Treatment standards for nickel in P074 and silver in P099 and P104 nonwastewatersare based on the performance of stabilization of F006 nonwastewaters. Treatmentstandards for nickel in P074 wastewaters are based on the performance ofchemical precipitation and filtration of K062 wastewaters. The Agency believesthat these wastes are more difficult to treat than the corresponding Pwastes based on the higher concentrations of metals and dissolved solidsanticipated to be present in F006 and K062 as compared to the P wastes(i.e., up to 100,000 ppm). The Agency is not promulgating treatment standardsfor barium in any P013 wastes or for silver in P099 and P104 wastewatersdue to the current lack of treatment data for these metals in their respectivewaste types. The Agency is not precluded from developing standards forbarium or silver in these particular wastes if treatment data becomes available.One commenter argued that the Agency should not regulate copper or zinc,as EPA proposed to do, because they are not hazardous constituents specificallylisted in Appendix VIII of 40 CFR Part 261. The Agency does not totallyagree, in that both zinc and copper are components of zinc cyanide andcopper cyanide. EPA has determined that both zinc and copper exhibit aquatictoxicity, and has considered adding these constituents to Appendix VIIIfor that reason. However, EPA has decided to reserve that determinationfor a later rulemaking, and is only regulating cyanides in these wastes(P029 and P121).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s60,r5.1,r1.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for P013, P021, P029, P030, P063, P074, P098,P099, P104, P106, and P121</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>110 </D><D>(</D>1)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>9.1 </D><D>(</D>1) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel (P074 only) <D>(</D>1) <D>0.32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver (P099 and P104 only) <D>(</D>1) <D>0.072</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s60,r4.2,r10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for P013, P021, P029, P030, P063, P074, P098,P099, P104, P106, and P121</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>1.9 </D><D> (</D>1)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>0.10 </D><D>(</D>1)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel (P074 only) <D>0.44 </D><D>(</D>1<F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">7. Cyanide Wastes Designated as D003 Reactive.</ITAG>Today's rule does not promulgate treatment standards for wastes identifiedas D003 wastes. In the January 11, 1989 proposed rule, the Agency presenteda strategy for the development of treatment standards for cyanide wastesdesignated as D003 (see 54 FR 1071) and proposed a subcategory for D003identified as the Reactive Cyanides Subcategory. According to 40 CFR 261.23(a)(5),a waste can be identified as D003 when it is a cyanide or sulfide bearingwaste which, when exposed to pH conditions between 2 and 12.5, can generatetoxic gases, vapors or fumes in quantities sufficient to present a dangerto human health or the environment. No specific comments were receivedthat challenged the development of this D003 Subcategory.In general, the Agency received many comments that supported the developmentof concentration-based treatment standards. However, some commenters expressedconcerns about what the treatment standard levels should be. The Agencybelieves that some of the general concerns about the measurement of cyanidesand the selection of technologies for electroplating and heat treatingcyanide wastes may also be applicable to D003 cyanide wastes. The Agencywill respond to these comments and propose treatment standards for D003wastes in the Reactive Cyanide Subcategory in a future notice of proposedrulemaking for the Third Third wastes.b. <T3>Wastes from chlorinated aliphatics production.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">F024_Wastes including but not limited to, distillation residues, heavyends, tars, and reactor clean-out wastes from the production of chlorinatedaliphatic hydrocarbons, having carbon content from one to five, utilizingfree radical catalyzed processes. (This listing does not include lightends, spent filters and filter aids, spent dessicants, wastewater, wastewatertreatment sludges, spent catalysts, and wastes listed in 261.32).</ITAG>Wastes identified as F024 are generated primarily by facilities in theorganic chemicals manufacturing industry, specifically those engaged inthe production of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons. Detailed technicaldescriptions of the specific production processes generating these wastescan be found in the background document for the listing of this waste code.Today's rule promulgates treatment standards for F024 wastewaters and nonwastewatersas proposed for all constituents except 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene, 3-chloropropene,di-n-octyl phthalate, chromium and nickel. BDAT treatment standards forF024 are based on rotary kiln incineration for nonwastewaters, and rotarykiln incineration followed by chemical precipitation and vacuum filtrationfor wastewaters. Other treatment technologies that can achieve these concentration-basedtreatment standards are not precluded from use by this rule. EPA is promulgatingtreatment standards for two metals in F024 wastewaters and fourteen organicconstituents in F024 nonwastewaters and wastewaters. The specific regulatedconstituents and treatment standards for these wastes are listed in thetables at the end of this section.Several commenters suggested that the Agency specify a method of treatmentas the BDAT treatment standard for the polychlorinated dioxins (PCDDs)and polychlorinated furans (PCDFs) instead of establishing concentration-basedtreatment standards. Where treatment performance data are available, theAgency prefers to set concentration-based treatment standards rather thanspecifying a method of treatment as the BDAT treatment standard. Definingconcentration-based treatment standards in terms of concentrations of hazardousconstituents in the treated waste ensures that treatment standards areachievable, in practice, using available technologies, but does not specificallymandate the use of any particular treatment technology in order to complywith the treatment standard. Because treatment performance data were availablefor the constituents regulated in F024, concentration-based treatment standardswere established.Several other commenters stated that the PCDDs and PCDFs should be regulatedfor the following reasons: (1) F024 is not listed for these constituents;(2) their levels in F024 were below the practical quantitation limits (PQLs);(3) QA/QC data did not affirm their presence in F024; and (4) a quantitationlevel below 10 ppb is difficult to achieve and standards should not beset any lower than the PQLs demonstrated in F024 incinerator ash.In response to the first issue, the Agency points out the hazardous constituentsfor which a waste is listed are considered by the Agency in selection ofconstituents for regulation. However, these constituents only provide aminimum basis for listing a waste as hazardous. The Agency believes thatit is not restricted to regulation of these constituents. Indeed, to doso would (at least in some cases) fail to substantially reduce toxicityor mobility of hazardous constituents in the waste, as required by section3004(m). Moreover, the language of 3004(m) applies to all ``hazardous constituents'',not just those for which the waste is listed. The Agency uses waste characterizationdata and treatment performance data collected under the BDAT program todetermine the constituents that should be regulated. A more detailed explanationof the selection of regulated constituents in F024 is provided in the BDATbackground document for this waste code.With respect to the second issue, the commenters were incorrect in statingthat PCDD and PCDF levels measured in the F024 wastes were below the PQLs.In fact, these constituents were detected in untreated F024 at levels of0.3 to 50 ppb (parts per billion), which were well above the PQLs (0.2to 30 ppt (parts per trillion)) for these constituents. Section III.A.1.(b.)of today's preamble provides a further discussion of the applicabilityof Appendix VII and the relationship of PQLs to BDAT treatment standards.The commenters were also incorrect with respect to the third issue on theQA/QC. As evidenced in the background document for this waste, the availableQA/QC data does confirm the presence of dioxins and furans in F024.The Agency also disagrees with the commenters' fourth issue. A quantitationlevel below 10 ppb is not difficult to achieve. The Agency does not anticipateany difficulties in achieving detection at the treatment standard of 1ppb for either the nonwastewater or wastewater. The treatment standardsfor all of the PCDDs and PCDFs regulated in F024 are greater than the PQLsdemonstrated on F024 incinerator ash (30 to 80 ppt). Finally, the Agencybelieves that these treatment standards are analytically achievable ona routine basis and points out that quantitation levels for these PCDDsand PCDFs have been achieved by commercial laboratory facilities at lowppt levels in nonwastewaters and low ppq (parts per quadrillion) levelsin wastewaters.The treatment standards set for bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and di-n-octylphthalate were opposed by one commenter who argued that setting treatmentstandards for these constituents was unnecessary because they were notdetected in the F024 feed streams at levels above their PQLs. This commenterfurther stated that since the treatment standards for these two constituentsare below their PQLs, the treatment standards are invalid and unreasonable.The commenter suggested that the low levels of these phthalates could bea result of cross-contamination and thus, recommended that the Agency eitherset a method of treatment as the treatment standard instead of establishinga concentration-based treatment standard or reserve the standards for thesetwo phthalate constituents until more complete information is available.The premise to the commenter's argument is incorrect in that both of thesephthalate constituents were quantified above their respective PQLs in theF024 feed streams. The treatment performance data for bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate in F024 demonstrate that substantial treatment was achieved byrotary kiln incineration. Because bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was not foundin either the laboratory blanks or the treatment residuals, the commenter'sclaim that this constituent could be present as a result of cross-contaminationdoes not appear to be supportable. Thus, the Agency has no reason to believethat the presence of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in F024 sampled by theAgency was due to cross-contamination. (See also the Agency's responseto comments on cross-contamination of phthalates in section III.A.3.(e.)of today's preamble.)The Agency's data indicated, however, that di-n-octyl phthalate was identifiedin only a few characterization samples at treatable concentrations. Further,bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was also found at treatable concentrationsin each of these samples. These two phthalate constituents have similaritiesin chemical properties and structure such that the Agency believes thatthey can be treated to similar concentrations by incineration. Due to thesimilarity in treatability of these constituents, any di-n-octyl phthalatepresent in F024 will be effectively controlled by regulating the bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (using incineration as BDAT). Accordingly, the Agency is promulgatingthe treatment standards for bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, but is not promulgatingthe treatment standards for di-n-octyl phthalate.Several commenters stated that the concentration-based treatment standardsfor F024 nonwastewaters should be identical with treatment standards previouslypromulgated for the same constituents in other waste codes. The Agencydisagrees with these commenters. BDAT treatment standards for a particularwaste are developed based on treatment performance data for that wasteor for a waste judged to be similar. Constituents may be treated to differentlevels depending on the waste matrices in which they are present. Accordingly,treatment standards for a constituent may vary among the waste codes inwhich the constituent is regulated.Another commenter suggested that the nonwastewater treatment standardsbe raised by two orders of magnitude because they believed the proposedtreatment standards could not be analytically achieved on a routine basis.However, based on routine analysis performed by contract laboratories supportingthe Agency's various programs, the Agency does not anticipate any analyticaldifficulties in achieving the F024 treatment standards on a routine basis.One commenter suggested that the Agency consider the composition of F024wastewater when it is comingled with wastewater from other treated listedwastes. However, the Agency cannot take into account all of the possiblemixes of waste residuals. (See also the previous discussion of mixing insection III.A.1.(c.) in today's preamble.) For these cases, the regulatedcommunity must consider the treatment standards for each regulated wastestream and comply with the strictest standards for each of the regulatedconstituents (or if mixing is part of a legitimate treatment process, seeka treatability variance).One commenter felt that stabilization of incinerator ash should not berequired unless leachable metal levels were higher than characteristichazardous waste levels. The Agency reminds the commenter that F024 treatedwaste residuals are also considered to be listed hazardous wastes underthe ``derived-from'' rule, regardless of whether or not the waste exhibitsa characteristic. The metal constituents originally proposed for regulation(chromium and nickel) were found in F024 at treatable levels. Because incinerationdoes not provide treatment for metals, the Agency chose to stabilize theincinerator ash to immobilize these and other metal constituents.One commenter felt that treatment of chromium and nickel was not demonstratedby the stabilization testing performed on K048 and K051 wastes, therebyinvalidating the transfer of the treatment standards for chromium and nickelfrom these waste codes to F024. This commenter suggested transferring treatmentperformance data from F006 instead.The Agency has recently completed an analysis of TCLP extracts obtainedfrom the stabilization of F024 incinerator ash residues. The results ofthis analysis show substantial reduction of metals in TCLP extracts afterstabilization. However, since this data was not available for public noticeand comment, and since the resultant treatment standards are significantlydifferent from the proposed standards, the Agency has decided not to promulgatetreatment standards for metals in F024 nonwastewaters in today's rule.The Agency is reserving treatment standards for metals in F024 nonwastewatersin order to provide notice that revised standards will be proposed forrestrictions in a future rulemaking. No specific comments or data werereceived disputing the validity of the proposed standards for the metalsin F024 wastewaters and thus the Agency is promulgating these standardsas proposed.The Agency discovered an error in its calculation of the proposed treatmentstandards for 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene and 3-chloropropene for F024 nonwastewater(i.e., 0.014 mg/kg for each constituents). Because the data used to calculatethese standards were correct and in the public record, the Agency is promulgatingthe recalculated standards in today's rule (i.e., 0.28 mg/kg for each constituent).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s60,r10,r10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for F024</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="2">2-Chloro-1,3-butadiene<D>0.28</D><D>Not applicable</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">3-Chloropropene</ITAG><D>0.28</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;<ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethane<D>0.014</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloroethane<D>0.014</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloropropane<D>0.014</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">cis-1,3-Dichloropropene<D>0.014</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">trans-1,3-Dichloropropene<D>0.014</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate<D>1.8</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachloroethane<D>1.8</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzofurans<D>0.001</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins<D>0.001</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzofurans<D>0.001</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins<D>0.001</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzofurans<D>0.001</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total)<D>Not applicable</D><D>Reserved</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D/>andmin16;andmin16;<D>Reserved</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s60,r10,r10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for F024</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>(mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="2">2-Chloro-1,3-butadiene<D>0.28</D><D>Not applicable</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">3-Chloropropene</ITAG><D>0.28</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;<ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethane<D>0.014</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloroethane<D>0.014</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloropropane<D>0.014</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">cis-1,3-Dichloropropene<D>0.014</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">trans-1,3-Dichloropropene<D>0.014</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate<D>0.036</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachloroethane<D>0.036</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzofurans<D>0.001</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins<D>0.001</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzofurans<D>0.001</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins<D>0.001</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzofurans<D>0.001</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total)<D>0.35</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>0.47</D><D/>andmin16;andmin16;</ITAG></ITAG>c. <T3>Wastes from pigment production.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">K002_Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of chrome yellowand orange pigments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K003_Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of molybdateorange pigments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K004_Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of zinc yellowpigments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K005_Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of chrome greenpigments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K006_Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of chrome oxidegreen pigments (anhydrous and hydrated).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K007_Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of iron bluepigments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K008_Oven residues from the production of chrome oxide green pigments.</ITAG>Wastes identified as K002, K003, K004, K005, K006, K007 and K008 are generatedprimarily by facilities in the inorganic chemicals manufacturing industry,specifically those engaged in the production of pigments. Detailed technicaldescriptions of the specific production processes generating these wastescan be found in the background document for the listing of these wastes.1. Nonwastewaters. Today's rule promulgates a ``No Land Disposal Basedon No Generation'' treatment standard for K005 and K007 nonwastewatersas proposed_applicable only to wastes generated from the process describedin the listing description and disposed after June 8, 1989. Many commentersopposed any standard that specifies ``No Land Disposal'' for a particularwaste. The Agency maintains that for <T3>certain </T3>wastes, this standard is appropriate. The Agency believesthat the following clarification of the applicability of this standardto K005 and K007 wastes may remove the majority of the commenters' concerns.Based on conversations with representatives of manufacturers of inorganicpigments and responses to EPA's RCRA section 3007 questionnaires, the Agencybelieves that the last company producing chrome-green and iron blue pigments(from which K005 and K007 wastes are generated), shut down production in1987. Thus, the proposed ``No Land Disposal'' standard is appropriate forthese wastes, with one important caveat. This standard applies only towastes generated from the process described in the listing descriptionfor these wastes (in 40 CFR 261.32) that are disposed after June 8, 1989(the effective date of this standard). The Agency recently modified existingregulatory standards for most of the ``No Land Disposal'' treatment standardspromulgated with the First Third wastes to adopt this distinction. See53 FR 31174 (August 17, 1988) promulgating these standards, and the subsequentrevision in 54 FR 18836 (May 2, 1989). The Agency adopts the explanationin the May 2, 1989 notice for its action here with respect to the wastefrom pigment production that are no longer being generated (i.e., K005and K007).K005 and K007 are Third Third Wastes that were originally scheduled tobe promulgated by May 8, 1990. Several commenters opposed the proposedaccelerated schedule for these wastes as well as other wastes. However,the statute does not preclude EPA from prohibiting the land disposal ofa given waste ahead of schedule (and the schedule in 40 CFR 268.10-268.12itself says that wastes will be evaluated by a given date, indicating thatthe specified date is the latest time by which EPA must act), and in factcompels the Agency to prohibit the land disposal of hazardous wastes assoon as possible. The Agency believes that this is a particularly prudentapproach for K005 and K007 nonwastewaters, since the basis of the treatmentstandard for these wastes is that they are not being generated and sinceno comments were received disputing this premise specifically for K005and K007.In the January 11, 1989, proposed rule for Second Third Wastes (54 FR 1072-74),EPA proposed a treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on Recycling''for K002, K003 and K006 nonwastewaters and proposed to revise the promulgatedtreatment standard (53 FR 31174) for K004 and K008 nonwastewaters from``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'', to ``No Land Disposal Basedon Recycling''. EPA received comments, however, suggesting that there maybe wastes generated as part of the recycling process that could remainsubject to the land disposal prohibitions, and which otherwise called intoquestion the circumstances of recycling. Although EPA does not necessarilyendorse these comments, the Agency believes that these issues warrant furtherstudy and, therefore, has decided that K002, K003 and K006 wastes willremain in the Third Third of the schedule. Thus, the Agency is not promulgatingthe treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on Recycling'' for K002,K003, and K006 nonwastewaters.The methods of recycling, which EPA has determined require further evaluation,also apply to K004 and K008 wastes; therefore, since EPA's initial premiseof no generation has not proven correct, EPA has decided to revoke thepromulgated treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''for K004 and K008 nonwastewaters, and to reschedule the development oftreatment standards for the nonwastewater forms of K004 and K008 wastesto the Third Third of the schedule. The Agency will study these wastesalong with K002, K003 and K006 nonwastewaters.2. Wastewaters. In today's rule, the Agency is not promulgating treatmentstandards for the wastewater forms of K002, K003, K004, K005, K006, K007or K008. Since K004 and K008 were First Third wastes, land disposal ofthese wastewaters continues to be subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisionsin 40 CFR 268.8. Because K002, K003, K005, K006 or K007 wastes were originallyscheduled for development of BDAT treatment standards with the Third ThirdWastes, land disposal of these wastewaters is not subject to the ``soft-hammer''restrictions.The Agency may develop concentration-based treatment standards for allof these wastewaters prior to May 8, 1990, if there is an identified needfor such standards (i.e. if wastewater forms of the listed waste are provento be generated). Wastewater forms of these wastes are expected to be generatedfrom only a few sources. The Agency is currently evaluating the possibilityof transferring treatment performance data from wastes having similar physicaland chemical characteristics. The Agency has identified several sourcesof chromium reduction, cyanide destruction, and metals precipitation/stabilizationperformance data which may be applicable.As a point of clarification, nonwastewater residuals generated from treatmentof K005 or K007 wastewaters are also considered to be the listed wastes(based on the derived-from rule) and would be required to meet the treatmentstandards for nonwastewaters when EPA develops them. However, as notedabove, the ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' standard does notapply to these wastes. It only applies to the waste as originally generated,according to the description of the waste in the listing (as listed in40 CFR 261.32).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,),i1,s25</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for K005 and K007</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewater forms of these wastes generated by the process describedin the waste listing description and disposed after June 8, 1989, and notgenerated in the course of treating wastewater forms of these wastes]</ITAG><H1>No Land Disposal Based on No Generation</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>d. <T3>Wastes from acetaldehyde production.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">K009_Distillation bottoms from the production of acetaldehyde fromethylene.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K010_Distillation side cuts from the production of acetaldehyde fromethylene.</ITAG>Wastes identified as K009 and K010 are generated primarily by facilitiesin the organic chemicals manufacturing industry, specifically those engagedin the production of acetaldehyde. Detailed technical descriptions of thespecific production processes generating these wastes can be found in thebackground document for the listing of these wastes.Today's rule promulgates treatment standards for organic constituents innonwastewater and wastewater forms of wastes identified as K009 and K010.Standards applicable to nonwastewaters are based on the performance achievedby rotary kiln incineration and the concentration of organics measuredin ash residuals. Standards applicable to wastewaters are based on theperformance achieved by steam stripping followed by biological treatmentand the concentration of organics measured in the resultant effluent wastewaters.Other treatment technologies that can achieve these concentration-basedtreatment standards are not precluded from use by this rule. The regulatedconstituents and treatment standards for these wastes are listed in thetables at the end of this section.In comments to the proposed rule, one of the two generators of K009 andK010 wastes indicated to the Agency that some of the organic constituentsproposed for regulation were extraneous to the manufacturing process ofacetaldehyde and that another of the proposed constituents could be effectivelycontrolled by the proposed regulation of chloroform. After reviewing thecommenter's rationale and the available data on the manufacturing of acetaldehyde,the Agency has determined that the proposed standards for 1,1-dichloroethane,acrolein, methylene chloride, and/or ethyl methacrylate in wastewatersare unnecessary and is therefore not promulgating the proposed standardsfor these constituents. However, the Agency is promulgating treatment standardsfor chloroform in both nonwastewater and wastewater forms of K009 and K010.The same commenter questioned EPA's legal authority to regulate constituentsthat were not explicitly identified by the Agency as toxic constituentsof concern when K009 and K010 were listed as hazardous wastes under SubtitleC of RCRA.The Agency strongly disagrees with the commenter's interpretation of section3004(m) and its interpretation of toxicity. RCRA section 3004(m) mandatesEPA to promulgate treatment standards that sustantially reduce the toxicityof the waste or that substantially reduce the likelihood of migration ofhazardous constituents from the wastes. Section 3004(m) applies to allhazardous constituents and does not limit the concern to those constituentsfor which the waste is listed. The Agency has thus interpreted the intentof the statutory language to measure reduction of toxicity in terms ofthe amount and types of constituents that define the chemical compositionof the waste. Thus, the Agency believes that in the development of treatmentstandards, the Agency can regulate any of the Appendix VII and VIII (40CFR Part 261) constituents.Further, the Agency has interpreted this statutory mandate as authorizingthe Agency to develop treatment standards for constituents that serve asindicators of performance, thereby accounting for the reduction in eitherthe amount or mobility of Appendix VII and VIII constituents containedin the wastes. The Agency believes that the use of surrogate or indicatorconstituents fully responds to the intent of section 3004(m) because therecould be instances that available analytical methods cannot satisfactorilyanalyze for Appendix VII and VIII constituents in complex waste matricesand thus, the Agency would be unable to develop concentration-based treatmentstandards for the waste.In addition, Appendix VII constituents supporting the listing of K009 andK010 were intended to support the Administrative Record of EPA in assessingthe need to regulate K009 and K010 as hazardous wastes under RCRA. Theseconstituents were by no means an exhaustive list of hazardous constituentscontained in the waste, but merely provided a minimum basis for listinga waste as hazardous. Therefore, the Agency believes that it is not restrictedto regulation of only these constituents. See further clarification ofthe use of Appendix VII constituents in section III.A.1.(b.) of today'spreamble.As noted in the proposal, performance data supporting the development oftreatment standards were not generated from the direct treatment of K009and K010 wastes. Instead, these performance data are from the treatmentof wastes either judged to be as difficult to treat as the wastes of concernor containing treatable concentrations of the constituents that are candidatesfor regulation in the wastes of concern.For wastewaters, these performance data were originally developed specificallyto support the effluent guidelines limitations for facilities in the OrganicChemical Plastics and Synthetic Fibers (OCPSF) industry and represent theperformance of Best Practical Technologies and Best Available Technologiesfor treatment of wastewaters. The Agency has determined that it is technicallyfeasible to transfer the OCPSF performance data to K009 and K010, and thusis promulgating treatment standards developed from these data. Furtherdetails of the Agency's evaluation of performance data and determinationsof BDAT are found in the BDAT background document for K009 and K010 wastes.Also, this commenter pointed out that the data used by the Agency in supportingthe wastewater standards may not have been adjusted for analytical spikedrecoveries. The adjustment that the commenter is referring to is knownas a ``correction factor'', which may be obtained by injecting a knownquantity of a pollutant into water and determining the percent of knownamount measured. During preliminary stages of the OCPSF rulemaking, EPAin fact used this adjustment technique for a variety of data, includingthe chloroform data discussed by the commenter in the present rulemaking.However, the Chemical Manufacturers Association submitted comments in theOCPSF rulemaking arguing that the use of correction factors for these dataare technically unsound. EPA agreed that these data are ``better representedas unadjusted for recovery'', and decided to present the data in unadjustedform (48 FR 11856, March 21, 1983).For purposes of the current rulemaking under RCRA section 3004(m), however,EPA believes that it is appropriate to apply a correction factor to thechloroform data to ensure consistency with the BDAT Generic Quality AssuranceProject Plan (EPA/530-SW-87-011, March 1987). This Plan presents data anduses it to establish standards in a conservative manner that assures thatvariability in calculating correction factors is accounted for.Thus, EPA has recalculated the wastewater standard for chloroform. At proposal,the chloroform standard for wastewaters was 0.09 mg/l. Today's rule promulgatesa revised chloroform standard of 0.10 mg/l. Although this revision is minimal,the Agency believes this recalculation of the chloroform standard was necessaryand fully complies with Agency methodology for developing treatment standards.Detailed information of the Agency's revisions to this standard are providedin the BDAT background document for K009 and K010 wastes.The proposed treatment standards for wastewaters were originally presentedas based on analysis of grab samples. The Agency received comments thatpointed out that the data used to determine the treatment standards representedanalysis of composite rather than grab samples. At the time of proposal,the Agency believed that since the standards were for volatile organicconstituents, analysis of grab samples had been performed due to potentiallosses of volatiles during a composite sampling. However, the Agency hassince determined that while grab samples are indeed used during sampling,the analysis of the samples is performed by careful compositing of thegrab samples in the analytical laboratory immediately prior to analysis.Therefore, the treatment standard for methylene chloride in K009 and K010wastewaters promulgated in today's rule are corrected and expressed asbased on a composite sample. See further discussion of issues concerninggrab versus composite sampling in section III.A.1.(f.) of today's preamble.The Agency also solicited comments on the need for regulating other chlorinatedorganic constituents that are not on the BDAT list but were found at treatableconcentrations. The only commenter supported the Agency's approach thatno regulation is necessary, indicating that available data appear to indicatethat these constituents are unlikely to interfere with the treatment ofthe regulated constituents. As a result, EPA is not promulgating, at thistime, additional requirements for these other organic constituents presentin K009 and K010 wastewaters.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,9.2,3.3</C>BDAT Treatment Standards for K009 and K010<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloroform <D>6.0 </D><D>(\1\)</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,9.2,3.3</C>BDAT Treatment Standards for K009 and K010<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any composite sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloroform <D>0.10 </D><D>(\1\)</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>e. <T3>Phthalates and phthalic anhydride production wastes. </T3><ITAG tagnum="15">K023_Distillation light ends from the production of phthalic anhydridefrom naphthalene. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K093_Distillation light ends from the production of phthalic anhydridefrom ortho-xylene. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K094_Distillation bottoms from the production of phthalic anhydridefrom ortho-xylene. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U028_Bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U069_Di-n-butyl phthalate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U088_Diethyl phthalate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U102_Dimethyl phthalate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U107_Di-n-octyl phthalate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U190_Phthalic anhydride </ITAG>Wastes identified as K023, K093, and K094 are wastes generated primarilyby facilities in the organic chemicals manufacturing industry, specificallythose engaged in the production of phthalic anhydride. Detailed technicaldescriptions of the specific production processes generating these threewastes can be found in the background document for the listing of thesewastes. Phthalic anhydride, when discarded, out-of-date, off-specification,or spilled often becomes the waste identified as U190. In contact withwater, phthalic anhydride reacts readily to become phthalic acid. Phthalicanhydride and phthalic acid can be reacted with other simple compoundsto form a class of chemicals known as phthalic acid esters. Generally,these esters are simply referred to as phthalates. The chemicals for whichwastes identified as U028, U069, U088, U102, and U107 are listed are allphthalates. All of these compounds are very similar in chemical composition and structure(i.e., they contain one aromatic ring and are comprised of only carbon,hydrogen and oxygen). For the purposes of determining BDAT, all of thesewastes have been grouped together into one treatability group identifiedas ``phthalates and phthalic anhydride production wastes'' or ``phthalates''(for short). Treatment standards for the majority of these wastes were originally scheduledto be promulgated as part of the Third Third wastes (i.e., promulgationby May 8, 1990). Only U028 and U107 wastes were originally scheduled forpromulgation with the Second Third wastes. However, in the January 11,1989, proposed rule for Second Third wastes, the Agency proposed standardsfor all nine of these phthalate and phthalic anhydride production wastesbased on a transfer of treatment standards from similar wastes identifiedas K024 (distillation bottoms from the production of phthalic anhdridefrom naphthalene). Standards for K024 wastewaters and nonwastewaters werepromulgated with the First Third wastes on August 8, 1988, based on theperformance of incineration of K024 nonwastewaters in a rotary kiln asmeasured by the concentrations of hazardous constituents found in the ashand scrubber water residuals. Several commenters opposed the accelerated schedule for these wastes. However,the statute (i.e., HSWA) does not preclude EPA from prohibiting the landdisposal of a given waste ahead of schedule (and the schedule in andSection;andSection;268.10 through 268.12 itself says that wastes will be evaluated by a givendate, indicating that the specified date is the latest time by which EPAmust act). The Agency believes that setting the treatment standards andrestrictions as early as possible is consistent with Congressional intentto move away from land disposal and towards treatment. Moreover, Congresscreated the capacity variance in section 3004(h) to address the concernsof providing additional time (where necessary) to develop protective treatmentor disposal capacity. Thus, in today's rule, the Agency is promulgatingtreatment standards as proposed for K023, K093, K094, U028, U069, U088,U102, U107, and U190 based on the direct transfer of standards for K024.While the treatment standards are based on the performance of incinerationof K024 in a rotary kiln, other treatment technologies such as fluidizedbed incineration, fuel substitution, biodegradation, and solvent extraction,that can achieve these standards are not precluded from use by this rule.The treatment standards in today's rule for all of these wastes are listedin the tables at the end of this section. 1. K023, K093 and K094 wastes. The Agency has data that indicate that thereare relatively few generators of K023, K093 and K094. Information alsosuggests that many of these wastes, as generated, are not typically landdisposed. The Agency considered promulgating a treatment standard of ``NoLand Disposal Based on No Generation'' for the nonwastewater forms of K023,K093 and K094. However, several commenters provided information that thesewastes are indeed being generated. Since the premise of no generation isnot valid, the Agency decided to promulgate the proposed concentration-basedstandards.The Agency determined that the treatment standards for K024 may be transferredto K023, K093 and K094 wastes because: (1) All of these wastes are generatedfrom the production of phthalic anhydride; (2) distillation residues generatedfrom production processes using naphthalene (corresponding to K023 andK024 wastes) are expected to contain higher concentrations of less volatileconstituents than distillation residues generated from production processesusing ortho-xylene (corresponding to K093 and K094 wastes). Since theseconstituents in K023 and K024 have lower volatility, they are more difficultto vaporize and subsequently be destroyed in a rotary kiln. K023 and K024are thus more difficult to treat than K093 and K094; and (3) distillation<T3>bottoms</T3> (K024) are expected to contain lower concentrations ofvolatile constituents than the distillation <T3>light ends</T3> (K023) and thus would be more difficult to treat thanK023. Based on this analysis, the Agency has determined that K024 representsthe most difficult to treat of the four wastes generated from the productionof phthalic anhydride. In addition, since K023, K024, K093 and K094 areall wastes from the production of phthalic anhydride, they are expectedto contain a greater concentration of interfering constituents than off-specor discarded phthalic anhydride (U190) and thus would be more difficultto treat than U190. Therefore, the Agency is directly transferring theconcentration-based standards for phthalic anhydride (as measured by theanalysis for phthalic acid) in K024 wastewaters and nonwastewaters to K023,K093, K094 and U190 wastewaters and nonwastewaters respectively.One commenter questioned why the Agency did not simply establish treatmentstandards for K023, K024, K093, K094 and U190 measuring for phthalic anhydriderather than phthalic acid. The commenter reasoned that: (1) Analyticalmethods for the direct measurement of phthalic anhydride exist and areavailable; (2) measurement should be for phthalic anhydride because ithas a significantly higher toxicity than phthalic acid; and (3) treatmentstandards for phthalic anhydride would allow treatment by hydrolysis andhydrolysis significantly reduces the toxicity of the waste.The Agency's response to these issues is twofold: (1) Although methodsfor the measurement of phthalic anhydride exist, the measurement of phthalicacid as a surrogate provides a more effective means of measuring treatment,due to the instability of phthalic anhydride in water (i.e., hydrolysisof the anhydride in the wastes prior to analysis of treatment residualscould result in false positive measurements of treatment efficiency ifanalysis were performed only for the anhydride); and (2) destruction ofphthalic anhydride by incineration provides a more complete reduction intotal toxicity than simple hydrolysis (i.e., incineration completely destroysboth the phthalic anhydride and the phthalic acid to carbon dioxide andwater, while hydrolysis does not provide any significant destruction ofthe organics, but rather enlarges the phthalic anhydride molecule to theacid form).Several commenters pointed out that, as initially generated, K023, K024,K093, K094 and U190 nonwastewaters are comprised primarily of phthalicanhydride and would contain practically no phthalic acid. Thus, the wasteswould probably meet the treatment standard based on analysis for phthalicacid without any treatment. Commenters suggested that the treatment standardshould include a hydrolysis step prior to analysis for phthalic acid.The Agency never intended, by establishing the standard only for phthalicacid, that these wastes should avoid treatment. In the proposed rule (54FR 1088 (January 11, 1989)), the standards for U190 were correctly expressedas ``phthalic anhydride (U190) reported as phthalic acid''. The Agencythus clearly intended that the phthalic anhydride be converted to phthalicacid prior to analysis. The Agency recognizes that the standards for K023,K093 and K094 were expressed in the proposed rule (54 FR 1078 (January11, 1989)) only as ``phthalic acid''. However, today's rule corrects thisinconsistency by expressing all of the wastewater and nonwastewater standardsfor K023, K093, and K094 and U190 as ``phthalic anhydride * * * (measuredas phthalic acid)''. Thus, the Agency is specifically requiring analysisfor phthalic acid after hydrolysis of K023, K093, K094 and U190 nonwastewaters.For the same reason, EPA is also making this same clarifying change asa technical correction to the standards for K024 wastewaters and nonwastewatersthat were adopted in the First Third rule. Thus, these standards are nowexpressed as ``phthalic anhydride * * * (measured as phthalic acid)''.(EPA is not altering the numerical standards for these K024 wastes.)For the wastewater forms of these wastes, the Agency is not requiring anadditional hydrolysis step provided that complete hydrolysis of the anhydridecan be reasonably assumed to have occurred (such as in cases where thephthalic anhydride in the waste has been in prolonged contact with waterin the waste, been sufficiently mixed with the water, or suspected to havebeen present in low concentrations in the water).2. Standards for U028, U069, U088, U102, and U107. EPA proposed concentration-basedtreatment standards for U028, U069, U088, U102, and U107 based on the transferof data on the performance of rotary kiln incineration for K024 nonwastewaters.Standards for these wastes are derived from a direct transfer of the numericalvalues for phthalic acid to each of the individual phthalate esters (i.e.,28 mg/kg for all nonwastewaters and 0.54 mg/l for all wastewaters as measuredby each phthalate).One commenter argued that the Agency has not adequately demonstrated thetransferability of the treatment standards for K024 wastes to these phthalateesters. The commenter stated that it had found no support for EPA's statementthat all of these compounds are anticipated to be easier to burn than phthalicacid. At the same time, the commenter claimed the following informationas support to their position: (1) The K024 phthalic anhydride residue isa solid and the phthalates are typically liquids; and (2) the autoignitiontemperature (a measure of the ease of ignition) for phthalic anhydrideis 1083anddegrees;F; 1032anddegrees;F for dimethyl phthalate; 950anddegrees;Ffor phthalic acid; and 735anddegrees;F for bis-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate.The Agency recognizes that there are many factors that affect how easilya compound can be burned, such as boiling point, activation energy, bonddissociation energy, heat of combustion, heat of formation, and generalstructural class. However, the information provided by the commenter appearsto support the Agency's position rather than the commenter's. In general,solids should be more difficult to burn than liquids. In addition, phthalicanhydride with the highest autoignition temperature appears to be moredifficult to burn than the phthalic acid or the other identified phthalates.Moreover, these data support that these phthalates pose relatively thesame difficulty in burning because their autoignition temperatures arewithin the same order of magnitude. More important, the Agency maintainsthat the performance data available to the Agency support that the treatmentstandards for the incineration of K024 are not only transferable to thesewastes but also achievable on a routine basis.Incineration data for K024 indiate that untreated K024 wastes containedfrom 1.3 to 22% phthalic anhydride, approximately 10% ash, and up to 83%polymeric materials. Analysis of the incinerator residues for phthalicacid, the surrogate for phthalic anhydride (see previous discussion forK023, K093 and K094 wastes above), indicated destruction to detection limitsof 8.2 mg/kg in the ash and 0.16 mg/1 in the scrubber water. Thus, if phthalicanhydride is, as the commenters' data indicates, one of the more difficultphthalates to burn, then the other phthalates and phthalic acid shouldbe able to be destroyed to these levels. The Agency points out that theash and the polymeric materials present in the untreated K024 waters alsocontribute to the difficulty in incineration of this waste. Thus, the Agencyconcluded that the K024 wastes are the most difficult to treat of thesewastes.The commenters expressed concern about several other issues that led themto believe that the standards could not be achieved. These include thepotential for false positives due to cross-contamination from: (1) Theco-incineration of nonhazardous materials containing phthalates; (2) plasticmaterials used during sampling and analysis; (3) nonhazardous materialsco-disposed with treatment residuals; (4) liners and covers used in a roll-offcontainers used to transport ash (containing 35 mg/kg of phthalates); and(5) plastic materials used in the scrubber water systems. They also arguedthat household garbage (containing 22 mg/kg of phthalates) and landfillliners would exceed the treatment standards. Thus, they concluded thatthe treatment standards were not meaningful nor could they possibly bemet. Several commenters further concluded that since the treatment standardscould not be met, the Agency should simply establish incineration as atechnology, rather than set concentration-based standards. Finally, onecommenter also stated that the Agency has an insufficient number of datapoints on which to base the standards.In response to the majority of these comments, the Agency points to thedata on phthalate concentrations in the residuals from the test burns offour different waste types that support the Agency's key positions. Thewastes include: (1) K019 (heavy ends from the distillation of ethylenedichloride in ethylene dichloride production); (2) K037 (wastewater treatmentsludges from the production of Disulfoton); (3) F024 (various wastes fromthe production of chlorinated aliphatics such distillation residues, heavyends, tars, and reactor clean-out wastes); and (4) K101/K102 (distillationtar residues from the distillation of aniline-based compounds and residuefrom activated carbon in the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals).These wastes represent a myriad of different hazardous waste types andthese data are from more than one different incineration facility.EPA analyzed for various phthalates in the incineration residues from thesetest burns as follows: (1) Six data sets for di-n-butyl and bis-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate in K019 ash residues and six data sets for di-n-octyl, di-n-butyl,and bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in K019 scrubber waters; (2) six datasets for bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in K037 ash and scrubber waters;(3) six data sets for diethyl and bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in F024ash and scrubber waters; and (4) six data sets for bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalatein K101 and K102 ash and scrubber waters.In general, the majority of the measured values for phthalates were approximatelyat the detection limit for the majority of phthalates that were analyzed.In kiln ash the measured values or detection limits ranged from andless;0.42to andless;2.0 mg/kg. This is consistent with the estimated PQLs for thesephthalates in ash residues (as calculated by multiplying the detectionlimits for the individual phthalates as measured by SW-846 Method 8250by the correction factor of 670 for low-level contaminated soil) rangingfrom 1.6 mg/kg for dimethyl phthalate to a maximum of 2.5 mg/kg for di-n-butyl,di-n-octyl, and bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. The data from these fourtest burns also indicated that in the scrubber waters the measured valuesfor these phthalates (or their detection limits) ranged from andless;0.002to andless;0.050 mg/l. The concentrations of phthalates in the untreatedwastes ranged from 0.05 to 500 mg/kg.The concentrations of phthalates in the untreated wastes (for the aforementioneddata) were relatively low. Accordingly, EPA did not attempt to transferstandards for phthalates from these wastes. However, these data illustrateseveral important points with regard to cross-contamination and the achievabilityof the standards. For four different test burns on four completely differentwaste types, analysis of treatment residuals indicated concentrations orachievable detection limits well below the promulgated treatment standards(typically an order of magnitude less). Thus the commenters' cross-contaminationconcerns during incineration, scrubber water processing, sample collection,transport of analytical samples, and laboratory preparation and analysisof the samples are not supported by these data. In addition, the properuse of analytical techniques in accordance with standard QA/QC in theirlaboratories can also reduce the potential for incidental cross-contamination.With respect to cross-contamination concerns from incineration of nonhazardouswastes, the Agency notes that in general, a facility operator may needto segregate wastes to meet treatment standards and that need is fullyconsistent with the intent of the land disposal restrictions. However,based on the demonstration of incinerability of the high concentrationsof phthalic anhydride in K024 wastes, the demonstration of achievabilityof low detection limits for ash and scrubber waters, and the basic highefficiency of destruction inherent to hazardous waste incinerators, theAgency believes that segregation of other wastes from these phthalate wastesis unnecessary and that compliance with the treatment standards for phthalatewastes would not be mitigated by co-incineration with other wastes containingphthalates.With respect to cross-contamination concerns from co-disposal with nonhazardouswastes, from liners and covers of roll-off containers, or from the landfillliners, the Agency notes that contamination from these materials (as evidencedin the commenters' data referenced above) would be expected to be smallcompared to the standards. It appears unlikely that an ash residue thattypically contains andless;2.0 mg/kg of phthalates would be significantlycontaminated to a level above the treatment standard of 28 mg/kg by wastescontaining only 22 mg/kg or 35 mg/kg. The fact that these materials containphthalate levels at or near the treatment standards has no relevance tothe achievability of the treatment standards. The fact that incinerationcan destroy hazardous wastes to a level that may be deemed nonhazardousis exactly the goal of incineration treatment.One commenter suggested that the Agency set technology-based treatmentstandards for these wastes instead of concentration-based standards. Thiscommenter felt that setting technology-based standards would eliminatethe concerns of achievability of the treatment standards due to cross-contamination.Though section 3004(m) specifies that BDAT treatment standards may be expressedas either concentration-based levels or as a method of treatment (technology-based),the Agency maintains that where treatment performance data are availableconcentration-based treatment standards should be established rather thanspecifying a method of treatment. Concentration-based standards allow industrythe flexibility to use any treatment technology or combination of technologiesto treat the wastes as long as land disposed residuals produced, have concentrationsof the regulated constituents less than or equal to the treatment standards.Moreover, none of the commenters supported their claims (that the treatmentstandards could not be achieved) with data on the measurement of phthalatesin treatment residuals. Because acceptable treatment performance data wereavailable for treatment of K024 and since the data support that cross-contaminationis not anticipated to affect the achievability of the standards, the Agencyis promulgating the concentration-based treatment standards for U028, U069,U088, U102, and U107.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>023, <T4>K</T4>024, <T4>K</T4>093, <T4>K</T4>094, <T4>and U</T4>190 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Phthalic anhydride . . .

Detailedtechnical descriptions of the specific production processes generatingthese wastes can be found in the background document for the listing ofthese wastes. The treatment standards for the organic hazardous constituentsare expressed as specific methods of treatment. For the nonwastewater formsof these wastes, the treatment methods are either incineration or fuelsubstitution. For the wastewater forms of these wastes, the methods areeither carbon adsorption followed by incineration or fuel substitutionof the spent carbon, or direct incineration of the wastewaters. In addition,for K115 wastes, the Agency is promulgating concentration-based treatmentstandards for nickel. The Agency did not propose treatment standards forK111 and K112 wastes, and therefore is not promulgating treatment standardsin today's rule. At this tme, K111 and K112 wastes are not prohibited fromland disposal. The Agency determined that the analytical methods available during thedevelopment of today's rule could not satisfactorily measure the principalhazardous organic constituents contained in K027, K113-K116, U221, andU223 wastes and treatment residuals. One commenter identified a preliminarymethod of analysis for at least one constituent and urged the Agency toestablish concentration-based standards based on the use of this method.However, since the Agency has not finalized this or any other analyticalmethod for the major constituents in these wastes, performance data couldnot be obtained using this method that would allow the Agency to developconcentration-based treatment standards for today's rule. The Agency hasalso been unable to identify any surrogate constituents or gross parametersthat could be used to assure reduction of the hazardous organic constituentsof concern. Thus, the Agency is unable to promulgate concentration-basedtreatment standards for organics in these wastes. EPA prefers concentration-based treatment standards due to the greaterflexibility in choice of technology used to achieve the standard, and tothe greater control afforded in ensuring efficient design and operationof the chosen technology. However, in the absence of analytical methodsthe Agency believes that the only logical alternative to a concentration-basedstandard is to establish a method of treatment as the BDAT treatment standard.It should be noted that promulgating standards expressed as specified methodsof treatment does not preclude the Agency from establishing concentration-basedstandards in the future, should an analytical method be developed withsufficient QA/QC that will measure the hazardous constituents, or shouldan adequate surrogate or indicator constituent be identified. The majority of commenters addressing this issue supported this approach.Further, EPA believes that this approach is consistent with the BDAT methodologyand with RCRA section 3004(m) which authorizes the Agency to establisheither levels or methods of treatment. Therefore, today's rule promulgatestreatment standards expressed as required methods for these wastes. The Agency also points out that when treatment standards are expressedas a specific technology rather than as concentration-based standards,it is possible for a generator or treater to demonstrate that an alternativetechnology can achieve an equivalent level of performance as that specifiedtreatment method (40 CFR 268.42(b)). This demonstration could be basedon: (1) A newly developed analytical method for the primary hazardous constituent;(2) a concentration-based standard utilizing a surrogate or indicator compound;or (3) other demonstrations of equivalence for an alternative method oftreatment. The resultant treatment standard, as well as any analyticalmethodology used in the demonstration, could then be proposed by the Agencyto be applicable to all wastes in this group. EPA's full rationale for finalizing the treatment standards promulgatedtoday is contained in the BDAT background document for these wastes. Thetreatment standards promulgated today for nonwastewaters and wastewaterforms of K027, K113-K116, U221, and U223 are summarized in the set of tablesat the end of this section. 1. Nonwastewaters. The Agency believes that incineration and fuel substitutionrepresents BDAT for the organics in nonwastewater forms of these wastes.The Agency is promulgating a treatment standard of ``Incineration or FuelSubstitution as a Method of Treatment'' for the nonwastewater forms ofK027, K113-K116, U221, and U223. Incinerators must comply with the requirementsof 40 CFR Part 264 Subaprt O, or Part 265 Subpart O. Similarly, fuel substitutionunits must comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 266, Subpart D.The majority of commenters addressing the nonwastewater treatment standardsagreed with the Agency's rationale for requiring that these hazardous wastesbe burned in incinerators regulated under 40 CFR Part 264 Subpart O orPart 265 Subpart O, or in fuel substitution units burning for energy recoveryunder requirements set out in 40 CFR Part 266 Subpart D (see 54 FR 1078-1080).There were a number of comments concerning the regulatory status of residuesresulting after burning these wastes. In the January 11, 1989 proposal,the Agency limited its discussion of residues from incineration/fuel substitutionto those that are routinely generated during the burning of the restrictedwastes (e.g., ashes, incineration/fuel substitution scrubber waters, spentfilters and/or sludges from the treatment of scrubber waters). When EPAspecifies a treatment method as the treatment standard, residues resultingfrom the required treatment method are no longer prohibited from land disposal(unless EPA should otherwise specify other requirements, as it is doingin this proceeding for nickel in K115 wastes and for organics concentratedin the spent carbon from the treatment of K027, K113-K116, U221, or U223wastewaters). However, some commenters asked the Agency to clarify the regulatory statusof wastes that are generated sporadically (e.g., aging equipment whichhave been exposed to the treated wastes). In response to the commenterswho pointed out that wastes resulting from maintenance operations (e.g.,replacing of aging materials in the combustion chambers, descaling of boilersoot, or debris equipment) as well as post treatment residues (e.g., filtercakes from water discharges of incineration scrubber waters and washesfrom the rinsing of incineration equipment) were not addressed by the Agencyin the proposed rule, EPA notes that none of these sporadically generatedresidues are prohibited from land disposal so long as they originate fromthe treatment method specified in this rule. See further discussion clarifyingthe applicability of the treatment standards to incinerator equipment andother treatment residues where the treatment standards are promulgatedas a specific method or method(s) of treatment in section III.A.3.(h.)(2.)of today's preamble. For K115, the concentration-based standard for nickel is based on the performanceachieved by stabilization of F006 sludges as measured by analysis of theTCLP extract. The Agency has determined that it is technically feasibleto transfer the F006 performance data to the K115 incinerator residuesbecause these residues are believed to show similar treatability characteristicsto F006 wastes (high concentrations of nickel), and none of the constituentsin K115 residuals are likely to interfere with the treatability of nickel.K115 wastes and its incineration/fuel substitution treatment residualsmust comply with the concentration-based treatment standards promulgatedfor nickel.2. Wastewaters. For organics in the wastewater forms of K027, K113-K116,U221 and U223 wastes, the Agency proposed as the BDAT treatment methodcarbon adsorption followed by incineration of spent carbon. Based on analysisof the comments received, today's rule promulgates treatment standardsfor these requiring the use of either: (1) Carbon adsorption of wastewatersfollowed by incineration of the spent carbon, or (2) direct incinerationof wastewaters as a method of treatment. For K115 wastewaters, the Agencyis also promulgating concentration-based treatment standards for nickel.The total concentration level for nickel is based on the transfer of performancedata that EPA has for metal bearing wastewaters containing nickel. K115must comply with both the organic and metal standards.Most of the commenters supported EPA's proposal specifying carbon adsorptionfollowed by incineration of the spent carbon as the method of treatmentfor K027, K113-K116, U221, and U223 wastewaters. The commenters agreedthat this treatment train substantially reduces the amount of soluble organicsin wastewaters by concentrating the soluble organics in the activated carbon.The spent carbon is generated by a nondestructive treatment process andthus, the spent carbon must undergo further treatment in order to destroythe amount of organics concentrated in the spent carbon. As a result, spentcarbon treatment residues must comply with the nonwastewater treatmentstandards being promulgated in today's rule for the organics in the nonwastewaterform of these wastes (i.e., incineration or fuel substitution).Carbon adsorption is often used at the end of a treatment train, afterthe constituent concentrations are reduced by technologies such as chemicaloxidation, hydrolysis or biodegradation. It should be noted that the useof such other treatment technologies prior to carbon adsorption is notprohibited by this rule provided that the activated carbon is utilizedat a point prior to placing the treated wastewaters in a surface impoundmentand that the other forms of treatment do not involve land disposal. (Treatmentin an impoundment that meets the requirements of RCRA section 3005(j)(11)(implemented by 40 CFR 261.4) is also not prohibited). For example, biologicaltreatment in a tank followed by activated carbon treatment, followed bydischarge of treated wastewaters to a surface impoundment is not precluded.Any nonwastewater residues from treatment technologies prior to carbonadsorption must meet the same treatment standards applicable to the spentcarbon (i.e., they would have to be incinerated in order to meet BDAT).The wastewater effluent from carbon adsorption is considered to meet thetreatment standard. See further discussion on the applicability of theland disposal restrictions on the residues from carbon adsorption in sectionIII.A.3.(h.)(2.) of today's preamble.EPA is further specifying that, to avoid ineffective treatment, effluentwastewaters must be treated by well-designed and well-operated activatedcarbon unit. This is a unit that is designed and operated in a manner whereoperating parameters are consistent with the range of operational parametersfor which the units were designed.For instance, wastewaters contaminated with K027 generate insoluble organics(polymers) that may upset the operation of the carbon-adsorption unit andthus, these insoluble organics (typically measured as total suspended solids,TSS) must be removed from the wastewaters prior to carbon adsorption. Pretreatmentof wastewaters will minimize operating problems such as plugging of thecarbon bed by keeping the TSS of influent wastewaters to the carbon adsorptionunit at levels that allow the unit to operate properly. Carbon adsorptionunits thus must be operated such that breakthrough of TDI and TDA doesnot occur. Selection of an indicator gross parameter or indicator constituentthat can account for the performance of this technology should be madeon a case-by-case basis (for example, as part of a facility's waste analysisplan). (See also the discussion of waste analysis plans in section III.A.1.(f.)of today's preamble.) The BDAT background document for K027, K111-K116,U221, and U223 wastes provides additional information of these and otherparameters that are typically monitored and considered for the design andoperation of carbon adsorption units.EPA emphasizes that the specified method of treatment includes incinerationor fuel substitution of the spent carbon and any other nonwastewater formsof the wastes that are generated up-stream from the effluent dischargeof the carbon adsorption column (e.g., spent filters or biotreatment sludges).The spent carbon and other nonwastewaters generated prior to carbon adsorptioncould presumably be burned for energy recovery in a boiler or industrialfurnace. Such additional treatment is necessary to thermally destroy theorganic constituents left behind in the spent carbon or nonwastewaters.Without these treatment steps, the hazardous constituents would be merelytransferred from one environmental media (water), to another (the carbonor other solid waste).Commenters also urged the Agency to consider direct incineration of thesewastewaters either as the BDAT or as an alternative BDAT method of treatment.The Agency believes that incineration of these restricted wastewaters isa treatment equivalent to carbon adsorption followed by incineration ofspent carbon because the amount of organics concentrated in the spent carbonundergo further treatment by incineration prior to land disposal (i.e.,incineration or fuel substitution of spent carbon and spent filters). Further,incineration/fuel substitution alone is capable of substantially reducingthe organics in these restricted wastewaters. Therefore, EPA is promulgatingincineration or fuel substitution as an equivalent BDAT method for thesewastewaters. Treatment residues from incineration or fuel substitutionof these wastewaters are not prohibited from land disposal.One commenter indicated that it thermally regenerates the spent carbonused to treat wastewaters contaminated with TDI wastes. Thermal regenerationof the spent carbon is not prohibited providing that the nonwastewaterresidues resulting from thermal regeneration of the spent carbon undergoincineration or fuel substitution (i.e., meet the K027, K113-K116, U221,and U223 nonwastewater standards promulgated today). The regenerated carbonis no longer a solid waste provided that it is further reused or marketed(See 40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)).Several commenters urged the Agency to consider currently available treatmentmethods that deactivate the reactivity of wastewaters containing TDI constituents(K027 and/or U223). The methods of treatment consist of adding large amountsof water with or without chemical reagents, in order to polymerize mostof the free TDI to ureas and/or polyurethanes. Commenters argued that thesedeactivated TDI wastewaters could be land disposed without causing anyharm to the human health and the environment.The Agency disagrees with the commenters because deactivation methods alonecannot be deemed BDAT. For instance, the addition of large amounts of watermay successfully remove the reactivity of TDI. This technology, however,leaves behind residues of aromatic organic rings containing nitrogen constituentssuch as TDA. Since this method of treatment, alone, neither removes thelong term toxicity of the organic constituents in the waste nor reducesthe potential for migration of organics, the Agency has ruled out thismethod of treatment as a potential candidate for BDAT.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K027, K113-K116, U221 and U223</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Incineration or fuel substitution \1\ as a method of treatment</H1><F>\1\ Incinerators must comply with 40 CFR 264 Subpart O or 265 SubpartO.

Detailed technicaldescriptions of the specific production processes generating these wastescan be found in the background document for the listing of these wastes.Today's rule promulgates treatment standards for nonwastewater forms ofK028, K029, K095 andK096 and wastewater forms of K028. The regulated constituentsand treatment standards for these wastes are listed in the tables at theend of this section. 1. Revision of the ``No Land Disposal'' standards. At the time of the proposedrule, information available to the Agency indicated that K029 wastes wereno longer being generated and that K095 and K096 wastes were being completelyrecycled. According to available waste characterization data, all threeof these wastes would be classified as nonwastewaters for the purposesof BDAT. Therefore, the Agency proposed a treatment standard of ``No LandDisposal Based on No Generation'' for K029 nonwastewaters and ``No LandDisposal Based on Recycling'' for K095 and K096 nonwastewaters. The Agencysimultaneously proposed that concentration-based standards for the nonwastewaterscould be transferred from treatment performance data for incineration ofeither K019 or F024 nonwastewaters. This data transfer would be possiblebecause these two wastes were more difficult to treat than K029, K095 andK096. Many commenters opposed any standard that specified ``No Land Disposal''for a particular waste because of complications arising from EPA's applicationof the ``derived-from'' and ``mixture'' rules. The commenters were concernedthat during the process of recycling their K095 and K096 wastes, an accidentalspill may occur thus creating a nonrecyclable K095 or K096 nonwastewaterbased on either the ``derived-from'' or the ``mixture'' rule. The commentersalso pointed out that potential fluctuations in the generation processes,or modifications to the generation process may result in the generationof a waste that could no longer be recycled. They indicated that thesewastes, if generated, would probably require incineration and may producean ash that would most likely require land disposal. Thus, a genuine needfor a concentration-based treatment standard would arise. The Agency maintains that for <T3>certain</T3> wastes, the ``No Land Disposal'' standard is appropriate.The Agency believes that the clarification of the applicability of thisstandard may remove the majority of the commenters' concerns. Such a standardis appropriate, provided that it applies to wastes generated from the processdescribed in the listing description for this waste that appears in 40CFR Part 261, and is disposed after the date of the applicable land disposalprohibition for that waste. A final rule published on May 2, 1989 providesa complete explanation of the basis for limiting the ``No Land DisposalBased on No Generation'' standard in this way (54 FR 18836). However, most commenters supported the Agency's proposed alternative (i.e.,the transfer of concentration-based treatment standards for K019 wastesto K029, K095 and K096). Thus, the Agency is not promulgating the ``NoLand Disposal Based on No Generation'' standard for K029 nonwastewatersnor is it promulgating the ``No Land Disposal Based on Recycling'' standardfor K095 and K096 nonwastewaters. 2. Standards for organic constituents. Commenters pointed out that K019wastes were more similar to K028, K029, K095 and K096 nonwastewaters thanF024 wastes. The Agency reexamined the data and agrees with the commenters.Waste characterization data on K019 nonwastewaters indicate that the K019wastes do contain higher concentrations of chlorinated organic compoundsthan the F024 wastes and are more difficult to treat than K028, K029, K095and K096 nonwastewaters. The Agency is therefore promulgating treatmentstandards for the organic constituents present in these nonwastewatersbased on the transfer of performance data from rotary kiln incinerationin K019 wastes rather than F024 wastes. Because characterization data on K029, K095, and K096 show the presenceof treatable concentrations of several organic constituents that the Agencyhad not found present in K028, the Agency developed standards for theseother organic constituents based on a transfer of performance data andexisting concentration-based standards for K019 wastes. Details on therationale for the transfer of performance data and the development of treatmentstandards for these organic constituents can be found in the BDAT backgrounddocument for these wastes. One commenter stated that the proposed organic constituent treatment standardsfall below PQLs achievable in the commenter's analytical laboratories.However, the background documents for K019 and for F024 demonstrate thatdetection levels in ash and scrubber water residuals can be achieved inlaboratories. In fact, the limits achieved by the laboratories used inthe BDAT studies are well below the proposed or final standards for allregulated organic constituents. The Agency believes this evidence verifiesthat analytical laboratories that are in compliance with EPA's QA/QC requirementscan quantify these regulated constituents at the treatment standard levels.See also a more complete discussion of the relationship of PQLs to BDATtreatment standards in section III.A.1.(b.) of today's preamble. Several commenters stated that the treatment standards for the organicconstituents should be consistent with treatment standards previously promulgatedfor the same constituents in other waste codes. The Agency disagrees withthese commenters. Treatment standards for a particular waste are developedbased on BDAT performance data for that waste or for a waste judged tobe similar. Treatment standards for particular constituents may vary fordifferent wastes due to differences in the waste matrices which may alterthe constituent treatability. The Agency also believes that these commentersconcerns may be moot by the Agency's decision to transfer treatment standardsfrom K019 wastes to K028, K029, K095 and K096 nonwastewaters. 3. Standards for metal constituents. In today's rule, only the proposedtreatment standards for cadmium, chromium, lead and nickel in K028 wastewatersare being promulgated. These wastewater standards are being transferredbased on the reanalysis of the performance data from the lime and sulfideprecipitation treatment of metals from K062 wastewaters. The Agency hasdetermined that these metals present in K062 wastewaters are more difficultto treat than when present in K028 wastewaters. K062 wastewaters typicallycontain much higher levels of these metals as well as other metals (suchas iron) and much higher levels of dissolved solids (such as sulfates orchlorides). These higher concentration of metals and dissolved solids interferewith the effectiveness of the precipitation reactions which are intendedto remove the metals of interest. Thus, the K062 wastewaters are more difficultto treat than K028 wastewaters. A more detailed explanation of the transferof these data for metal constituents in K028 is provided in the BDAT backgrounddocument for these wastes. The Agency did not receive any comments opposingthe transfer of these K062 treatment performance data specifically to K028wastewaters nor were any comments or data received indicating that thesestandards could not be achieved. Therefore, the Agency is promulgatingthese standards as proposed. Standards for nickel and chromium in K028 nonwastewaters were originallyproposed based on performance data for these metal constituents from thestabilization of K048 and K051 incinerator ash. One commenter felt thatthese data were not demonstrated by the stabilization testing performed,thereby invalidating the transfer of the treatment standards. This commentersuggested transferring treatment performance data from F006 instead. Meanwhile, the Agency has recently completed an analysis of TCLP extractsobtained from the stabilization of F024 incinerator ash residues. The resultsof this analysis show substantial reduction of metals in TCLP extractsafter stabilization. At the same time, the Agency reexamined the data forthe stabilization of F006, K048, and K051 nonwastewaters and concludedthat these new stabilization data for F024 wastes may better representthe levels of treatment obtainable for the metals expected to be containedin K028 ash residues (as well as those for K029, K095, and K096). However,since these data were not available for public notice and comment, andsince the resultant treatment standards are significantly different fromthe proposed standards, the Agency has decided not to promulgate treatmentstandards for these metals in K028 nonwastewaters in today's rule. TheAgency is reserving standards for nickel and chromium in K028 nonwastewatersin order to provide notice that these constituents will be proposed forrestrictions in a future rulemaking. Another commenter challenged transferring stabilization data in order toregulate inorganic constituents in treatment residues from K028 wastesbecause the commenter believed that if the concentrations for metals fallbelow the levels which define a characteristic waste (40 CFR Part 261 SubpartC), no treatment should be required. The Agency reminds the commenter thatthe treatment residuals are also considered to be listed hazardous wastesunder the ``derived-from'' rule, regardless of whether or not the wasteexhibits a characteristic. See further discussion of the relationship ofBDAT to the ``derived-from'' rule in section III.A.1.(d.) of today's preamble.In a similar manner, one commenter questioned the need to regulate metalsconstituents in residues derived from a predominantly organic waste. Becauseincineration is designed specifically to destroy organics and because itdoes not provide treatment for metals (which end up in the ash), the Agencybelieves that stabilization of the ash to immobilize metal constituentsis a technically valid approach. Other commenters stated that these metals should not be regulated becausethese wastes are not listed for these constituents. The hazardous constituentsfor which a waste is listed are considered by the Agency is selection ofconstituents for regulation. However, these constituents are by no meansan exhaustive list, but merely provide a minimum basis for listing a wasteas hazardous. As discussed in section III.A.1.(b.) of today's preamble,the Agency therefore believes that it is not restricted to regulation ofonly these constituents. The Agency uses waste characterization and treatmentperformance data collected under the BDAT program to determine the constituentsthat should be regulated. At the time of proposal, there was apparently no need for metals standardsin K029, K095 and K096 nonwastewaters, because K095 and K096 nonwastewaterswere being totally recycled and because K029 nonwastewaters were identifiedas no longer being generated. The Agency intends to develop standards formetals in nonwastewaters forms of K029, K095, and K096 and propose themwith the Third Third wastes prior to promulgation by May 8, 1990. 4. Standards for K029, K095 and K096 wastewaters. The Agency also did notpropose treatment standards for the wastewater forms of K029, K095 andK096. The Agency stated that it believed that there was no need for theirdevelopment because it was unlikely that these wastewaters were being generatednor could be generated. Commenters indicated that they believe that thelikelihood for generation of these wastewaters is reasonably good, andthus a need exists for standards. In particular, wastewaters may be generatedduring the recycling of K095 and K096 (e.g., wash waters, contaminatedcooling water, and spill rinsings). (However, if K095 and/or K096 wastesare used as intermediates and thus not discarded, these materials wouldnot be solid wastes, and any residues from their use would therefore notbe deemed to be derived from management of a listed hazardous waste.)The Agency agrees with these commenters that wastewater forms of K029,K095 and K096 may be generated and thus treatment standards are needed.However, today's rule cannot promulgate any treatment standards becauseno standards were previously proposed. The Agency intends to develop standardsfor wastewater forms of K029, K095, and K096 and propose them with theThird Third wastes prior to promulgation by May 8, 1990.K029, K095, and K096 are all considered Second Third wastes for which treatmentstandards were to be established by the statutory deadline of June 8, 1989.Since the Agency is not promulgating standards for the wastewater formsof K029, K095 and K096 by their statutory deadline, land disposal of thesewastewaters shall be regulated by the ``soft hammer'' provisions in 40CFR Part 268.<ITAG

P071, P085,P089, P094, P097, P109, P111, U058, U087 and U235. It also promulgatesstandards for wastewater forms of K036. Detailed technical descriptionsof the specific production processes generating these wastes can be foundin the background document for the listing of these wastes.The principal constituents of concern in each of these wastes are membersof a group of organic compounds known as organophosphorus compounds. Themajority of these constituents also contain sulfur and are often referredto as phosphorothioates. All of these compounds are somewhat similar instructure and elemental content. Most are typically manufactured for useas pesticides. Therefore, the Agency has classified all of these compoundsas one treatability group identified as the organophosphorus pesticides.In the January 11, 1989 proposed rule for Second Third wastes, the Agencyproposed a direct transfer of the concentration-based standards from theincineration of K037 wastes (wastewater treatment sludge from the productionof Disulfoton) to some of these organophosphorus pesticide wastes (i.e.,those that have analytical methods) and proposed incineration as a methodof treatment for the others. The basis of all of these standards is thesimilarities in structure and elemental composition of all of the organophosphoruspesticides to each other and to Disulfoton, the principal hazardous constituentof concern in K037 wastes. (EPA promulgated concentration-based treatmentstandards for K037 wastewaters and nonwastewaters with the First Thirdwastes on August 8, 1988.) In addition, the Agency believes that Disulfotonis one of the most difficult chemicals in this group of organophosphoruspesticides to incinerate. Given that Disulfoton can be effectively treatedby incineration and that the chemicals in this group are structurally similar,the Agency believes that all the other organophosphorus pesticides in thissection can be effectively treated by incineration, and that the concentration-basedstandard for each representative regulated organophosphorus pesticide canbe identical to that achieved by incineration of Disulfoton in K037 wastes.Therefore, the Agency believes that the performance achievable by incinerationrepresents BDAT for all of the organophosphorus pesticide chemicals andis promulgating concentration-based treatment standards for the wastewatersand nonwastewater forms of K038, K040, P039, P071, P089, P094, P097 andU235 as well as wastewater forms of K036 based on this transfer. EPA is establishing incineration as a method of treatment for the nonwastewaterforms of K039, P040, P041, P043, P044, P062, P085, P109, P111, U058 andU087. Standards for the wastewater forms of these organophosphorus pesticideshave been developed based on the performance of biological degradation,incineration and carbon adsorption. These are discussed in detail in thefollowing sections.1. <T3>Wastes with concentration-based BDAT standards.</T3> The Agency hasdetermined that, currently, there are analytical methods (most of whichcomply with the EPA, Office of Solid Waste, Publication: SW-846 (generallyreferred to as SW-846)) that allow the measurement of the principal hazardousconstituent (organophosphorus pesticide) contained in wastes and treatmentresiduals for wastes identified as K036, K038, K040, P039, P071, P089,P094, P097 and U235. Thus, the Agency is able to promulgate concentration-basedtreatment standards for: Disulfoton in K036 wastewaters; Disulfoton inP039 wastewaters and nonwastewaters; Phorate in K038, K040 and P094 wastewatersand nonwastewaters; and Methyl parathion, Parathion, Famphur, and tris-(2,3-Dibrompropyl) phosphate in P071, P089, P097 and U235 wastewaters andnonwastewaters, respectively. Standards applicable to nonwastewaters arebased on the performance achieved by rotary kiln incineration and the concentrationof organophosphorus pesticide measured in the ash residuals. Standardsapplicable to wastewaters are based on the performance achieved by biologicaltreatment and the concentration of organophosphorus pesticide measuredin the resultant effluent wastewaters. Where the treatment standards areexpressed as concentration-based standards, other treatment technologiesthat can achieve these concentration-based treatment standards are notprecluded from use by this rule. The regulated constituents and treatmentstandards for these wastes are listed in the tables at the end of thissection. The proposed treatment standards for the wastewater forms of these organophosphoruspesticides were based on the concentrations of Disulfoton as measured ingrab samples of scrubber water from the incineration of K037 nonwastewaters.EPA has decided to change these standards in the final rule based on additionalperformance data for a biological wastewaters treatment system submittedduring the comment period. These data were from the treatment of industrialwastewaters containing low concentrations of Parathion. Although, thesedata (based on analysis of grab samples for influent wastes and compositesamples for effluent) were not generated specifically for this rulemakingand do not result from the direct treatment of the RCRA waste identifiedas P089 (Parathion), the Agency believes that these wastewaters have concentrationsof Parathion that are similar to those wastewaters identified specificallyas K036, K038, K040, P039, P071, P089, P094, P097 or U235. The Agency hasalso determined that these data are valid and represent the level of performancethat appears to be achievable for this type of biological wastewater treatmentsystem.The Agency points out that the promulgated concentration-based treatmentstandards for wastewaters for these organophosphorus wastes are based onthe analysis of composite samples rather than grab samples, because thisnew performance data received during the comment period were based on theanalysis of composite effluent samples. See further discussion of whenEPA uses composite samples to establish treatment standards in sectionIII.A.1.(f.) of today's preamble.EPA believes these data to be a preferable measure of treatment performancebecause where the Agency has performance data (that conform with BDAT methodology)on wastewater treatment processes and data on incineration (constituentconcentrations in scrubber water), the Agency prefers to establish treatmentstandards based on the wastewater treatment processes. (<T4>Note._</T4>This does not preclude the Agency from establishing treatmentstandards for other wastes based on constituent concentrations in incineratorscrubber waters.)EPA also believes that these data for biological treatment of Parathioncan be validly transferred to the wastewaters forms of the other organophosphoruspesticide waste codes. This is due to the structural similarity betweenParathion and the other organophosphorus wastes. Thus, today's rule promulgatesrevised concentration-based standards for the wastewater forms of K036,K038, K040, P039, P071, P089, P094, P097 and U235 based on analysis ofcomposite samples from wastewater treatment. (EPA also intends to investigateif these wastewater standards are appropriate for K037 wastewaters_a FirstThird waste_as part of the Third Third rulemaking.)The Agency received one comment disagreeing with the proposed concentration-basedstandards for P089, P097, and U235, because of a perceived lack of analyticalmethods to detect Parathion (P089), Famphur (P097) and tris-(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate. The Agency disagrees with this comment, and believes that allthree chemicals can be analyzed. Famphur and Parathion can be analyzedby Method 8270 of SW-846, and have been proposed in the January 23, 1989update to the third edition of SW-846. Tris-(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphatecan be analyzed by Method 8350 of SW-846, and will be included in the secondupdate to the third edition of SW-846, due to be proposed as an officialmethod in early 1990. All three chemicals have been previously includedon the BDAT List for that reason.One commenter questioned why, in the January 11, 1989 proposal, standardswere proposed for K036 wastewaters, but not for K036 nonwastewaters. TheAgency promulgated a BDAT standard of ``No Land Disposal based on No Generation''for K036 nonwastewaters with the First Third wastes on August 8, 1988.(See 53 FR 31174). EPA amended this standard on May 2, 1989, to apply towastes generated from the process described in the listing descriptionand disposed after August 17, 1988 (54 FR 18836). In the forthcoming proposedrule for Third Third wastes, the Agency intends to propose a standard forother forms of K036 nonwastewaters, such as K036 spill residues or solidresidues from the treatment of K036 leachate.One commenter stated that K036 and P039 may be harder to destroy by incinerationthan K037, because the concentration of Disulfoton in K036 and P039 maybe many times higher than the concentration in K037. The Agency disagreeswith this comment. While it recognizes that higher concentrations of Disulfotonmay occur in K036 and P039 wastes, the Agency believes that the concentrationswould not be significantly different from that measured in the untreatedK037 wastes. The data in the background document for K037 show Disulfotonconcentrations of 10.4% to 24.6% for the untreated wastes. The Agency believesthat these concentration levels would be within the same order of magnitudeof those anticipated to be in K036 and P039. The Agency successfully incineratedthis high level of Disulfoton such that the concentrations in the residualswere at or near the detection limit in the residuals. Further, the K037waste tested also contained approximately 75% solids (filter paper anddiatomaceous earth filter aid) which the Agency believes could interferewith the destruction of Disulfoton and thus make K037 more difficult todestroy than K036 and P039 wastes that may have slightly higher concentrationsof the chemical, but a lesser amount of interferences.2. Wastes with treatment methods as BDAT. The Agency determined that theanalytical methods available during the development of today's rule couldnot satisfactorily measure the principal hazardous organic constituents(organophosphorus pesticide) contained in wastes and treatment residualsfor wastes identified as K039, P040, P041, P043, P044, P062, P085, P109,P111, U058 and U087. Thus, the Agency is unable to promulgate concentration-basedtreatment standards for these wastes and is promulgating methods of treatment.Although EPA prefers a concentration-based standard (due to both the greaterflexibility in choice of technology used to achieve the standard and inthe greater control afforded to ensure efficient design and operation ofthe chosen technology), in the absence of analytical methods (that wouldmeasure and assure compliance), the Agency believes that establishing amethod of treatment is the only logical alternative for BDAT. In general,the majority of commenters on this issue supported this approach. Further,EPA believes that this is consistent with the promulgated BDAT methodologyand with RCRA Section 3004(m) which authorizes the Agency to establisheither levels or methods of treatment. Therefore, today's rule promulgatesmethods of treatment for these wastes.As discussed previously, the Agency believes that incineration representsBDAT for the nonwastewater forms of these wastes. Besides the fact thatEPA does not currently have an analytical method for this group of organophosphoruspesticides, EPA has currently not identified any organic constituents inthese wastes that could be used as a surrogate or as an indicator compoundin order to develop alternative concentration-based standards for thesewastes. It should be noted that promulgating BDAT standards expressed asspecific methods of treatment does not preclude the Agency from establishingconcentration-based standards in the future, should an analytical methodbe developed with sufficient QA/QC that will measure the hazardous constituentsor should an adequate surrogate or indicator constituent be identified.Therefore, the Agency is promulgating a BDAT treatment standard of ``Incinerationas a Method of Treatment'' for the nonwastewater forms of K039, P040, P041,P043, P044, P062, P085, P109, P111, U058 and U087. Incinerators must complywith 40 CFR 264 Subpart O or 265 Subpart O.For the wastewater forms of these organophosphorus wastes, the Agency proposedcarbon adsorption as the BDAT treatment method in 54 FR 1086 (January 11,1989). The residual from this type of nondestructive treatment (i.e., thespent carbon) is still considered to be the same waste code as before treatment,and must be managed as such. It therefore must be incinerated prior toland disposal.It should be noted that the use of other treatment technologies prior tocarbon adsorption is not prohibited by this rule. Carbon adsorption isoften used at the end of a treatment train, after the constituent concentrationsare reduced by technologies such as chemical oxidation, hydrolysis or biodegradation.Any nonwastewater residues from these treatment technologies prior to andincluding carbon adsorption would have to be incinerated in order to meetthe treatment standard. The wastewater effluent from carbon adsorptionwould be considered to meet the treatment standard. See section III.A.3.(j.)of today's preamble for a similar discussion on carbon adsorption for wastewatersassociated with K027 wastes.Several commenters suggested that there are cases where it may be preferableto incinerate the wastewater, rather than have the waste adsorbed by carbon.Two examples of these situations occur when: (1) The waste appears as aresult of the ``mixture-rule'' with other waste codes for which the BDATtreatment method requires incineration; and (2) the waste is generatedsuch that it contains a relatively high level of TOC but just under the1% TOC cut-off and maintains its classification (for purposes of BDAT)as a wastewater. In either case, the Agency agrees with the commenter thatincineration would then be the preferred or required (as in the case ofthe first example) method of treatment. In fact, the Agency did considerincineration as an alternative destructive technology to carbon adsorption.However, it seemed impractical to require all wastewater streams to beincinerated. (Some data indicated that the majority of hazardous wastewaterscontain significantly less than 1% TOC.)For those wastewaters that do contain just under the 1% TOC level, incinerationmay be more desirable and possibly more effective than carbon adsorption.This might lead one to believe that for these ``high'' TOC wastewaters,the Agency should therefore dictate incineration over carbon adsorption.However, at this time the lack of a method to analyze for the constituentsof concern makes it difficult (but not impossible) to correlate the performanceefficiency of the two treatment methods for the constituents of concernto performance efficiency of a surrogate or indicator compound. One possiblesurrogate to measure treatment efficiency is total organic carbon (TOC);however, the Agency is currently unaware of the level of TOC for whichcarbon adsorption would be more efficient than incineration. Thus, the Agency is promulgating ``Incineration or Carbon Adsorption asa Method of Treatment'' as BDAT for the wastewater forms of wastes identifiedas K039, P040, P041, P043, P044, P062, P085, P109, P111, U058 and U087.Spent carbon and any other nonwastewater residuals generated up-streamfrom a carbon adsorption unit must meet the nonwastewater standards applicableto these wastes prior to land disposal, and so must be incinerated. Carbonadsorption units must be operated such that breakthrough of organophosphoruscompounds does not occur. (See section III.A.3.(f.) of today's preamblefor a discussion on the need for specifying some level of proper operatingconditions for carbon adsorption technology.) Selection of a surrogateor indicator compound of this breakthrough should be made on a case-by-casebasis (for example, as part of a facility's waste analysis plan). See alsothe discussion of waste analysis plans in section III.A.1.(f.) of today'spreamble.Commenters asked the Agency to specifically clarify the applicability ofthe ``treatment as a method'' BDAT standards to treatment residuals. Theysuggested that the Agency could clarify the standards by stating that theydo not apply to ``derived-from'' wastes. While the Agency agrees that clarificationis necessary, it does not agree that the standards should be identifiedas suggested for several reasons: (1) all wastes identified as ``derived-from''are not necessarily treatment residues (e.g., leachate); (2) all nonwastewatertreatment residues (such as spent carbon, residues from recycling, andresidues from wastewater treatment processes prior to carbon adsorption)may contain leachable hazardous organics; (3) some wastewaters (such asscrubber waters from steam stripping operations or recovery process waters)may contain significant amounts of untreated constituents. However, the Agency believes that the previous discussions in this sectionassist in clarifying the applicability to these residues. As a summary,the Agency points out the following: (1) Scrubber waters from incineratorsin compliance with 40 CFR Part 264 Subpart O of Part 265 Subpart O areconsidered to meet BDAT for these wastes and can be land disposed; (2)the scrubber waters from incinerators in compliance with 40 CFR Part 264Subpart O or Part 265 Subpart O therefore are not required to undergo ``CarbonAdsorption as a Method of Treatment''; (3) incinerator ashes and residuesfrom the treatment of scrubber waters from incinerators in compliance with40 CFR Part 264 Subpart O of Part 265 Subpart O are considered to meetBDAT for these wastes and can be land disposed; (4) incinerator equipment(such as fire brick) that are derived from sections of the incineratorthat have been directly subjected to the high temperatures of the incinerator(that was operated in compliance with 40 CFR Part 264 Subpart O of Part265 Subpart O) or are downstream from the high temperature zones are consideredto meet BDAT for these wastes and can be land disposed. The Agency believesthat the hazardous constituents contained in these wastes are destroyedin the high temperature zones of the incinerator and would not be expectedto be present in the high temperature zones or in the equipment down streamof these zones; (5) wastewater effluent (and their subsequent nonwastewatertreatment residues) from the carbon adsorption units treating wastewaterforms of these waters are considered to meet BDAT for these wastes andcan be land disposed; and (6) spent carbon (and nonwastewater residuesfrom the pretreatment of these wastes prior to carbon adsorption) fromthe treatment of wastewater forms of these wastes are not considered tomeet BDAT for these wastes and must meet the BDAT treatment standards fornonwastewaters prior to land disposal. As noted earlier, when treatment standards are expressed as a specifictechnology rather than concentration-based standards, it is possible fora generator or treater to demonstrate that an alternative technology canachieve an equivalent level of performance as that specific treatment method(40 CFR 268.42(b)). This demonstration could be based on: (1) A newly developedanalytical method for the primary hazardous constituent; (2) a concentration-basedstandard utilizing a surrogate or indicator compound; or (3) other demonstrationsof equivance for an alternative method of treatment. The resultant treatmentstandard as well as any analytical methodology used in the demonstrationcould then be proposed by the Agency to be applicable to all wastes inthis group.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for Organophosphorus Wastes </T4>K038, K040,P039, P071, P089, P094, P097 <T4>and </T4>U235<H1>Waste code</H1><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition, (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">K038 <D>Phorate </D><D>0.1 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K040 <D>Phorate </D><D>0.1 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P039 <D>Disulfoton </D><D>0.1 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P071 <D>Methyl parathion </D><D>0.1 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P089 <D>Parathion </D><D>0.1 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P094 <D>Phorate </D><D>0.1 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P097 <D>Famphur </D><D>0.1 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U235 <D>tris-(2,3-Dibromopropyl) phosphate </D><D>0.1 </D><D>(\1\)</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,6,r75,9.3,3.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for Organophosphorus Wastes </T4>K036, K038,K040, P039, P071, P089, P094, P097 <T4>and </T4>U235 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any composite sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">K036 <D>Disulfoton </D><D>0.025 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K038 <D>Phorate </D><D>0.025 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K040 <D>Phorate </D><D>0.025 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P039 <D>Disulfoton </D><D>0.025 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P071 <D>Methyl parathion </D><D>0.025 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P089 <D>Parathion </D><D>0.025 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P094 <D>Phorate </D><D>0.025 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P097 <D>Famphur </D><D>0.025 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U235 <D>tris-(2,3-Dibromopropyl) phosphate</D><F>\1\Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,,0),s100</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for Organophosphorus Wastes </T4>K039, P040,P041, P043, P044, P062, P085, P109, P111, U058 <T4>and </T4>U087 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Incineration as a method of treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><F>\1\ Incinerators must comply with 40 CFR 264 Subpart O or 265 Subpart0.</F></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,,0),s100 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for Organophosphorus Wastes </T4>K039, P040,P041, P043, P044, P062, P085, P109, P111, U058 <T4>and </T4>U087 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Carbon adsorption \2\ or incineration\1\ as a method of treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><F>\1\ Incinerators must comply with 40 CFR 264 Subpart O or 265 SubpartO. </F><F>\2\ Spent carbon and any other nonwastewater residuals generated upstreamfrom a carbon adsorption unit must meet the nonwastewater standards applicableto these wastes prior to land disposal.

Wastes from 2,4-D production.K043_2,6-Dichlorophenol wastes from the production of 2,4-D.Wastes identified as K043 are generated primarily by facilities in theorganic chemicals manufacturing industry, specifically those engaged inthe production of 2,4-D. The Agency has data that indicate that there isonly one current generator of this waste. Detailed technical descriptionsof the specific production process generating these wastes can be foundin the background document for the listing of this waste code. The treatmentstandards for this waste are based on data obtained from wastes generatedand treated at this facility.Today's rule promulgates treatment standards for K043 wastewaters and nonwastewatersbased on incineration. Other treatment technologies that can achieve theseconcentration-based treatment standards are not precluded from use by thisrule. EPA is promulgating treatment standards for thirteen organic constituentsincluding tetrachloroethene, six chlorinated phenols, and six polychlorinateddibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDDs and PCDFs, respectively). Thespecific regulated constituents and treatment standards for these wastesare listed in the tables at the end of this section.The promulgated treatment standards for the regulated chlorinated phenolsin wastewaters are based on new data received by the Agency from the solegenerator/treater of K043 during the comment period. The original datafor wastewaters consisted of two data points. The new data provided sixadditional wastewater data points. The Agency believes these new data aremore representative of treatment that can be achieved for K043.In general, the comments submitted on the proposed rule for K043 relatedto four general issues: (1) The establishment of treatment standards forPCDDs and PCDFs; (2) specifying a treatment technology as the treatmentstandards for K043 rather than establishing concentration-based standards;(3) the validity of the performance data upon which the treatment standardsare based; and (4) the regulation of tetrachloroethene in K043.Commenters were concerned with the treatment standards established forthe six regulated PCDDs and PCDFs. Some commenters thought that the PCDDsand PCDFs should not be regulated because K043 is not listed for theseconstituents. This is not a sufficient reason for not establishing a treatmentstandard, for the reasons given a number of times earlier in this preamble.(See further discussion of the use of Appendix VII in establishing BDATin section III.A.1.(b.) of today's preamble and the discussion of the analysisfor analysis of PCDDs and PCDFs in F024 wastes in section III.A.3.(b.)of today's preamble.) The Agency thus uses waste characterization and treatmentperformance data to determine the constituents that should be regulatedfor a waste. A more detailed explanation of the selection of regulatedconstituents in K043 is provided in the background document for this wastecode.Another commenter felt that the tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins (TCDDs) andtetrachlorodibenzofurans (TCDFs) should not be regulated because the incinerationdata (submitted by the commenter) did not indicate the presence of theseconstituents in K043 wastes. In response, the Agency points out that theavailability of specific treatment data for a given constituent in a particularwaste, is not a requirement for the selection of that constituent for regulation.This is particularly true when EPA has sufficient additional waste characterizationdata that indicate the presence of that constituent in treatable levelsin wastes other than what was specifically treated. While the Agency didnot have specific treatment data for TCDDs and TCDFs in the submitted K043incineration data, it did not waste characterization data indicating thepresence of several of these constituents in other untreated K043 wastesat concentrations that the Agency determined were treatable by incineration.This same commenter expressed concern that the BDAT treatment standardsfor these constituents in K043 were transferred from treatment standardsfor K099. According to the commenter, the wastes are not sufficiently similarto justify transferring standards. As stated in the proposed rule (54 FR1083), the Agency also has data on six PCDDs and PCDFs in untreated andtreated K099 wastes. Since K099 is generated at the same site as K043 (inthe next step of the 2,4-D production process) and since they contain similartypes and concentrations of hazardous constituents as contained in untreatedK043 wastes, the Agency believes that K099 wastes are sufficiently similarin order to justify transferring standards for these constituents to K043wastes.In addition, the Agency feels that incineration of K043 waste will treatthe PCDDs and PCDFs to levels that are comparable to those achieved bychlorination of the K099 waste. Further, the Agency points out that standardsfor PCDDs and PCDFs are the same as those promulgated for F024 wastes (whichare also based on incineration). The Agency believes that the F024 wastestested by the Agency are more difficult to incinerate than K043, basedon available characterization data, and that the resultant F024 incineratorash is as difficult or more difficult to analyze than the respective K043nonwastewater residuals. While the Agency maintains that the transfer ofstandards from K099 is supportable, the Agency believes that the data fromF024 also lends support to establishment of these standards for K043. Seesection III.A.1.(e.) of today's preamble for a more detailed discussionrelated to the transfer of treatment standards.Several commenters expressed general concerns about the ability to complywith the treatment standards for PCDDs and PCDFs because they are too low(i.e., near the practical quantitation limits (PQLs) for these constituents).They claim that the 1 ppb detection limit is not routinely achievable,that only a handful of laboratories can perform the analysis to this level,and that analysis and reporting of these constituents typically takes threeto eight months.The Agency disagrees that these treatment standards are too low and doesnot anticipate any difficulties in achieving detection at the treatmentstandard of 1 ppb for either the nonwastewaters or wastewaters. While theAgency has no data for PCDDs and PCDFs in treated K043 residuals, datado exist for these constituents in treatment residues of other wastes indicatingthat detection limits of less than 1 ppb can routinely be achieved. Forexample, performance data from incineration of F024 show detection limitsof less than 10 parts per trillion (ppt) in residual wastewater and lessthan 100 ppt in residual ash. The Agency believes that these treatmentstandards are analytically achievable on a routine basis and points outthat quantitation levels for these PCDDs and PCDFs have been achieved bycommercial laboratory facilities at low ppt levels in nonwastewaters andlow parts per quadrillion (ppq) levels in wastewaters. The Agency alsocontends that there are a sufficient number of laboratories capable ofperforming the analysis of PCDDs and PCDFs to the 1 ppb level and thatthe analysis can be performed in a timely manner, as was the case for F024sample analyses. Furthermore, because there currently is just one generatorof K043, the Agency does not believe that the regulation of PCDDs and PCDFsin K043 will adversely affect laboratory capacity to perform such analyses.See also further discussion of PQLs in section III.A.1.(b.) of today'spreamble.One commenter suggested that the Agency set technology-based treatmentstandards for K043 instead of concentration-based standards. This commenterfelt that setting technology-based standards would be equivalent to establishingconcentration-based levels because the concentrations were based on performancedata from the sole generator of K043 whose treatment facility is well designedand operated. Though section 3004(m) specifies that BDAT treatment standardsmay be expressed as either concentration-based levels or as a method oftreatment (technology-based), the Agency maintains that where treatmentperformance data are available, concentration-based treatment standardsshould be established rather than specifying a method of treatment. Concentration-basedstandards allow industry the flexibility to use any treatment technologyor combination of technologies to treat K043 as long as the treatment residualsproduced (that are destined for land disposal) have concentrations of theregulated constituents less than or equal to the treatment standards. Inaddition, other facilities in the future may generate K043 wastes and theAgency has no guarantee that such facilities will have treatment systemsthat are as well-designed and well-operated as that of the current solegenerator/treater. Because acceptable treatment performance data were availablefor treatment of K043, the Agency established concentration-based treatmentstandards for this waste.One commenter claimed that the wastewater performance data supplied toEPA were insufficient to establish statistically valid concentration-basedtreatment standards because the background levels of chlorinated phenolswere no different than levels in the scrubber water collected during thetest burn. EPA does not concur with the claim that the supplied data arenot useful in establishing statistically valid treatment standards forwastewaters. The sole generator provided the Agency with results from theanalysis of eight scrubber water samples collected during incinerationtreatment tests. The concentrations of the regulated constituents in thesesamples are substantially lower than those in the untreated waste. Thus,incineration has been demonstrated to provide substantial treatment ofthese constituents. The Agency's own statistical analysis confirms thefact that the levels of regulated constituents found in the scrubber watersampled showed statistically significant reduction from the levels identifiedin the raw waste. The fact that background samples of scrubber water andthe scrubber water collected during the treatment test were similar intheir concentrations of regulated constituents indicates simply that theincineration of K043 completely destroys these constituents in the waste.A concern of the sole generator/treater was that concentration-based treatmentstandards would force the facility to incinerate dilute K043 wastewatersor seek a treatment standard variance because of difficulties arising fromthe ``derived-from'' and ``mixture'' rules. The Agency does not believethe generator/treater would be forced to incinerate or seek a treatmentvariance for dilute ``derived-from'' or ``mixed'' K043 wastewaters. First,the K043 wastewater treatment standards would apply only if the wastewaterswere placed in land disposal units. Second, if such wastewaters are beingplaced in land disposal units, the facility has the option of delistingthe scrubber waters following the incineration of K043 waste such thatthe ``derived-from'' and ``mixture'' rules would no longer apply. Third,the treated K043 wastewaters could be isolated in a land disposal unitsuch that other plant wastewaters would not become subject to the BDATtreatment standards set for K043 under the ``mixture'' rule.Finally, it is clear that the type of problem referred to by the commenterwould arise only if the other wastes at the facility also contain treatablelevels of the regulated hazardous constituents in K043, in which case itfurthers RCRA's goals to have effective treatment of those constituentsbefore land disposal of the combined waste. For example, if waste A hasa treatment standard of 10 mg/l for hazardous constituent X and is treatedto meet the standard but then is combined with other waste streams andthe combined waste stream now contains greater than 10 mg/l of X, the otherwastes must contain X in treatable concentrations. Further treatment tominimize threats to human health and the environment thus would be appropriatebefore land disposal (See also RCRA section 3004(m)).One commenter believes that tetrachloroethene should not be a regulatedconstituent in K043 because it is used as a cleaning solvent for K043 processequipment and is not present in the waste as a result of the productionprocess that generates K043. Further, the commenter states that this constituentis already being regulated under the Solvents and Dioxins Rule (under F002waste) for this use.In this case, the waste stream in question is a process waste that hasbecome contaminated with small amounts of solvent; it is not a mixtureof spent solvent and K043. Furthermore, the K043 waste does not containa spent solvent since the tetrachloroethene that contaminated the K043had not been generated as a waste when the contamination took place. Dataprovided to EPA indicated that tetrachloroethene was present in the untreatedK043 as a treatable level and showed substantial treatment by incinerationin K043 treatment residuals. The solvent cleaning step is part of the productionprocess and any contamination present in the waste before treatment becomespart of that waste and, thus, can be made subject to BDAT treatment standards.Therefore, the Agency chose to regulate tetrachloroethene in K043 at atotal constituent concentration of 0.006 mg/l in wastewaters and 1.7 mg/kgin nonwastewaters.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>043 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2> Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-Dichlorophenol <D>0.38 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,6-Dichlorophenol <D>0.34 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,5-Trichlorophenol <D>8.2 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,6-Trichlorophenol <D>7.6 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorophenols (Total) <D>0.68 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol <D>1.9 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachloroethene <D>1.7 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,6.3,8 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>043 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2> Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-Dichlorophenol <D>0.049 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,6-Dichlorophenol <D>0.013 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,5-Trichlorophenol <D>0.016 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,6-Trichlorophenol <D>0.039 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorophenols (Total) <D>0.018 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol <D>0.22 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachloroethene <D>0.006 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> B. ``Soft Hammer'' Applicable Treatment Standards <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>(Note:</T4> EPA is not reinterpreting any of the principles relatingto the RCRA ``soft hammer'' provision (RCRA section 3004(g)(6)) containedin the First Third rule and preamble. See 53 FR 31179-31185. The Agencyis adding the following discussion, which repeats those principles, solelyfor purposes of providing information.)</ITAG>The Agency has not promulgated treatment standards for the First Thirdand Second Third wastes in Tables B.(a) and B.(b). If EPA fails to settreatment standards for any hazardous waste included in 40 CFR 268.10 or268.11 by the August 8, 1988 or June 8, 1989 statutory deadlines, suchwaste is subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions. Under the ``soft hammer'' provisions, these wastes may be land disposedin a landfill or surface impoundment only if the generator makes certaincertifications, and only if the unit meets the RCRA 3004(o) minimum technologicalrequirements. Among other things, the ``soft hammer'' provisions requirethat prior to disposal in a landfill or surface impoundment unit meetingthe minimum technological requirements, a generator must demonstrate hisgood faith effort to treat his waste by the best practically availabletreatment technology(ies). The Agency has interpreted this to mean practicallyavailable treatment that provides the greatest environmental benefit (40CFR 268.8(a)(1)). Where no treatment is practically available, the generatormay so demonstrate. The required demonstration and certification must besubmitted to the Regional Administrator. ``Soft hammer'' wastes becomesubject to the statutory hard hammer as of May 8, 1990. The Agency is amending andSection; 268.12 to include wastewater residuesderived from the treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastes by certain processes(shifting such wastewater residues to the Third Third). This action willallow these wastewater residues to be disposed in units not meeting minimumtechnological requirements and such residues will not be subject to thecertification requirements of andSection; 268.8. This action is being takenbecause a number of companies use BDAT-type treatment to treat ``soft hammer''wastes, and then further treat the resulting treatment residues in impoundmentsthat do not satisfy minimum technological requirements, but meet the requirementsof section RCRA section 3005(j)(3) or 3005(j)(13). The Agency believesthat persons who are substantially treating their wastes to levels thatmay satisfy ultimate treatment standards are not precluded from furthertreatment of these wastes in polishing (i.e., 3005(j)(3)) or advanced biologicaltreatment (i.e., 3005(j)(13)) units that are substantially protective ofhuman health and the environment, although not equivalent to minimum technologyimpoundments from the standpoint of preventing migration from the unit.Furthermore, EPA does not believe that these types of treatment residualsare the types of contaminated wastes deserving of prioritization in thesecond third of the schedule. The Agency has identified several treatment technologies that are generallyconsidered appropriate for the nonwastewater forms of ``soft hammer'' wastes(see 53 FR 31175). These technologies include: metal recovery, leaching/oxidation,metals stabilization, ash stabilization, chemical oxidation, biodegradation,incineration, and PCB incineration. Treatment technologies generally consideredappropriate for the wastewater forms of ``soft hammer'' wastes include:aqueous metal recovery, chromium reduction, metals precipitation, steamstripping, carbon adsorption, oxidation/reduction, chemical oxidation,biodegradation, incineration, and PCB incineration. The technologies are listed as general categories of technologies thatEPA believes have a reasonable probability of application to the wastecodes listed. These categories do not specify any particular type of technology(e.g., incineration can represent liquid incinerators, rotary kiln, orfluidized bed incinerators). The actual choice of a particular technologyor even train of technologies depends on the physical and chemical characteristicsof the specific waste. Specific selection of one technology depends onits functional design. The Agency notes that many of these wastes, when existing as untreatedwastes, are already prohibited from land disposal because they are Californialist wastes. However, as was discussed in the August 17, 1988 final rule,treatment to comply with the California list prohibitions (including thecodified statutory prohibition levels) does not necessarily satisfy the``soft hammer'' requirements of 40 CFR 268.8 and, in fact, the Californialist prohibitions represent the minimum treatment required for such ``softhammer'' wastes prior to land disposal (53 FR 31187). In the case of anoverlap between a ``soft hammer'' waste and a California list statutoryprohibition, the ``soft hammer'' provisions still apply because they arepotentially more protective. However, in no case may a waste be disposedof in excess of the California list prohibition levels.Where EPA has promulgated a California list treatment standard, however,the soft hammer does not apply. <T3>Id. </T3>Thus, the ``soft hammer'' does not apply to California listHOCs for which EPA has established a treatment standard. <T3>Id.</T3>The following tables are presented as an aid to generators seeking appropriatetechnologies to treat ``soft hammer'' F- and K-listed wastes. Several technologiesare listed for each waste code, in descending order of preference. EPAnotes that certain technologies are only appropriate for certain constituenttypes and that more than one treatment technology may be required (if practicallyavailable) to treat the different constituents of concern in the waste.The Agency emphasizes that these tables are not to be considered as stricttreatment requirements. In general, however, EPA will use these tablesin evaluating the demonstrations and certifications received for thesewastes and is providing this information to aid the generator in determiningthe best practically available technology (if any) for treating his wastein compliance with andSection; 268.8.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>B.a._<T4>Appropriate Treatment Technologies for First Third and Second Third``Nonwastewaters''</T4><H1>RCRA Waste Code </H1><H1>Potential California List Applicability </H1><H1>Primary Applicable Treatment Technologies</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">F019 <D>Cyanide </D><D>Electrolytic Oxid. </D><P>Alkaline Chlorin. </P><P>UV Ozonation Incineration Ash Stabil.</P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K004 <D>Chromium </D><D>Metals Recovery.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K008 <D> </D><D>Metals Stabil.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K041 <P/>K097 <P/>K098 <P/>K042 <D>Halogenated Organics </D><D>Incineration.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K105 <D>PCBs/Halogen.

Capacity Determinations<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Determination of Alternative Capacity and Effective Dates for SurfaceLand-Disposed Wastes for Which Treatment Standards Are Promulgated </ITAG>a. <T3>Total Quantity of Land-Disposed Wastes. </T3>The capacity analysesfor wastes for which EPA is today finalizing treatment standards were performedusing the National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, Disposal,and Recycling Facilities (the TSDR Survey). EPA conducted the TSDR Surveyduring 1987 and early 1988 to obtain comprehensive data on the nation'scapacity for managing hazardous waste and on the volumes of hazardous wastebeing disposed of in or on the land (i.e., land disposal). Survey dataare part of the record for this final rule. In addition, EPA recently conducted the National Survey of Hazardous WasteGenerators (the Generator Survey). The Generator Survey was designed togather data on waste generators and exempt hazardous waste treatment capacity,along with detailed waste characterization data. Although the majorityof these data are not yet available, EPA used a subset of the data to corroborateconclusions as to the amount of treatment capacity required for the electroplatingwastes (F006-F012). These data are available as part of the administrativerecord. The various land disposal methods used and the quantities of waste handledare presented in Table III.C.1.a. Since publication of the proposed rule,EPA has received additional data from late-reporting TSDR facilities. Althoughthe new data do not affect any of the national capacity variance decisionsfor surface disposed wastes, they have been included in this discussionfor completeness. Some methods of land disposal, including use of saltdomes, salt bed formations, and underground caves and mines, are not addressedin the capacity analyses because of insufficient data on the types andvolumes of wastes disposed of by these methods. The TSDR Survey indicated that about 623 million gallons of wastes forwhich standards are finalized today were disposed in or on the land in1986. This includes approximately 3 million gallons of wastes that werestored in surface impoundments, and 1 million that were stored in wastepiles. These stored wastes will eventually be treated, recycled, or permanentlydisposed in other units. To avoid double counting, the volumes of wastesreported as being stored in surface impoundments or waste piles have notbeen included in the volume of wastes requiring alternative treatment capacity.Furthermore, this final rule prohibits the placement of wastes affectedby this rule in waste piles or surface impoundments for storage. The TSDR Survey indicated that less than 50,000 gallons of the wastes addressedtoday were treated annually in surface impoundments that do not meet EPA'sminimum technology requirements. However, this amount is actually a treatmentresidual from an impoundment that was replaced with a tank. Because theAgency assumes that this waste is now being sent off-site for treatment,this amount is included as treatment capacity required in today's rule.In addition, 5 million gallons are treated in waste piles, less than 1million gallons were disposed in surface impoundments, 10 million gallonswere disposed in land treatment units or landfills, and 604 million gallonsare injected underground. All of these wastes will require alternativetreatment capacity. b. <T3>Required Alternative Capacity for Surface Land Disposed Wastes. </T3>EPAassessed the requirements resulting from today's final rule for alternativetreatment capacity for surface land disposed wastes. EPA first characterizedthe volumes of wastes for which treatment standards are being established,since these wastes require alternative treatment. Waste streams were characterizedon the basis of land disposal method, waste code, and physical/chemicalform. Using this information, EPA placed the wastes into treatability groupsidentifying applicable treatment technologies. The waste volumes were thensummed by treatability group to determine the amount and type of alternativetreatment capacity that would be required when owners or operators complywith the land disposal restrictions being promulgated today. Based on this analysis, the EPA estimates that today's rule could affectabout 623 million gallons of wastes that are land disposed annually. Thistotal includes wastes that were stored only; consequently, only about 619million gallons will require alternative treatment capacity. Of this total,15 million gallons were surface disposed (i.e., excluding underground injection),and the remaining 604 million gallons were underground injected. (See sectionIII.C.3. for determinations of alternative capacity and effective datesfor wastes injected underground.)The volumes of surface land disposed wastes that require alternative commercialtreatment/recycling capacity are presented in Table III.C.1.b. This tabledoes not include wastes that can be treated on site by the generator. As explained in preamble section III.A.1., with limited exceptions, EPAis finalizing treatment standards expressed as concentration limits basedon the performance of the Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT),rather than requiring treatment using BDAT. Where the treatment standardis a specific level of performance to be met, then any treatment methodmay be used to achieve the concentration level specified by the standard.However, BDATs (and technologies that the Agency finds perform comparably)as discussed in preamble section III.A., were used as the basis for determiningavailable capacity. The TSDR Survey contains data on specific treatment processes at facilities.The data enable EPA to identify specific BDAT treatment (and treatmentthe Agency finds performs comparably) in its assessment of both off-siteand on-site capacity. Therefore, EPA believes that the capacity identifiedas available for a specific treatment technology will be capable of meetingthe treatment standards, since a well-designed and well-operated BDAT treatmentprocess should be capable of complying with the promulgated treatment standards.c. <T3>Capacity Currently Available and Effective Dates. </T3>Table III.C.1.cpresents an estimate of the volume of wastes that will require alternativetreatment before land disposal to comply with the standards finalized today.The amount of capacity that is available at commercial facilities in eachcase is also presented. Available capacity is equal to the specific treatmentsystem's maximum capacity less the amount used in 1986, and was calculatedusing the TSDR Survey data. In addition, the available capacity presentedin this section was adjusted to account for wastes previously restrictedfrom land disposal by subtracting the capacity required for land disposedsolvent wastes, California List Halogenated Organic Compound (HOC) wastes,and First Third wastes. It is important to note that some of the wastes, because of their actualphysical form, cannot meet treatment standards simply by using the technologyidentified as BDAT. These wastes must be treated through several steps,called a ``treatment train''. EPA assumes that the resultant residualswill also need to be treated using alternative technologies before landdisposal; therefore, the total volumes reported were assigned to appropriatetechnologies. The following sections discuss the results of the individual capacity analysesand effective dates for each waste code included in today's rule. <T3>Wastes from Electroplating Operations. </T3>For today's final rule,EPA has revised the proposed cyanide treatment standards for cyanide-containingF007, F008, F009 waste from electroplating operations. The final wastewaterand nonwastewater treatment standards are based on alkaline chlorination.The treatment standards for metals in treatment residuals from alkalinechlorination are based on chemical precipitation followed by settling andfiltration for wastewaters, and stabilization for the nonwastewaters. EPAestimates that 2 million gallons of wastewaters and nonwastewaters willrequire cyanide treatment before stabilization as a result of today's treatmentstandards. After analyzing the TSDR Survey data, EPA has determined that sufficientcommercial capacity exists for these wastes (both wastewaters and nonwastewaters).EPA has therefore determined that no long term national capacity variancefor these wastes is warranted. However, in order to be cautious and allowtime (if any is truly needed) for facilities to adjust existing cyanidetreatment processes to operate more efficiently, EPA has determined togrant a 30-day extension for the electroplating wastes (see also the discussionin preamble section II.E.). As shown below, however, EPA believes thatthere will be ample treatment capacity at the end of 30 days (if not sooner)to accommodate demand for treatment of these wastes.In response to public comments, EPA reevaluated the amount of alternativetreatment capacity necessary to treat F006 wastes as a result of today'sfinal rule. The results of this analysis corroborate the Agency's positionthat the majority of F006 wastes containing cyanides are already beingpretreated on-site to cyanide levels that meet the treatment standard,and therefore, only limited additional commercial capacity is needed. EPA evaluated TSDR Survey data and Generator Survey data from approximately1,500 facilities, selected from those generating the largest volumes ofF006 wastes. The TSDR Survey contained data on 358 facilities generatingF006 wastes in 1986. Of the total volume generated, 69 percent is generatedat facilities with on-site cyanide treatment, and 27 percent was determinedto be non-cyanide bearing F006. Consequently, only 4 percent of the F006waste reported as generated in the TSDR Survey would need alternative off-sitetreatment capacity for cyanides.  EPA also evaluated a subset of Generator Survey data currently available.This analysis involved evaluating data from almost 1,500 facilities. Theanalysis identified 322 facilities generating F006 waste. Since the GeneratorSurvey contains waste concentration data, EPA was able to identify thevolume of wastes with the following: Cyanide concentrations above and belowthe treatment standards; with unknown cyanide concentration; and wherethe presence of cyanide is unknown. This analysis showed that only 7 percentof the F006 waste for this data subset was not analyzed by the generatorfor the presence of cyanide, or the cyanide concentration in the wastewas unknown, or had a cyanide concentration in excess of the treatmentstandard. However, less than 0.7 percent of the volume of the F006 wastehad a cyanide concentration above the treatment standard or had cyanideswith unknown concentration levels. In summary, 93 percent of this samplereported meeting the treatment standard, approximately 1 percent reportedexceeding the treatment standard, and 6 percent reporting unknown cyanidelevels. The percentage of compliance could be higher since it is reasonableto assume that most of the unknown wastes will contain cyanides in concentrationsless than the treatment standard, otherwise generators would know and reportthat cyanides were present.  Although EPA has only evaluated data from a subset of F006 generators,it believes this pattern to be representative of the total census of F006wastes. (As noted in section III.A.3.a.2.i., the data on total cyanidesubmitted to EPA in the public comments to the rulemaking also showed greaterthan 90 percent compliance with the final treatment standard.)  In order to be cautious in assessing the need for alternative treatmentcapacity, EPA is assuming that, as a worst case, 10 percent of F006 wastemay need alternative commercial treatment capacity. EPA therefore assumesfor this rule that 10 percent of the 129 million gallons of land disposedF006 (or about 13 million gallons) may require alternative commercial treatment.Sufficient commercial alkaline chlorination capacity exists to treat thisvolume of waste. Consequently, EPA does not believe that any extended nationalcapacity variance is warranted for F006 nonwastewaters. As stated earlier,the Agency is delaying the effective date of the cyanide standard for F006nonwastewaters 30 days in order to give facilities a short period of timeto adjust equipment performance should this be necessary. (Technically,the basis for this 30-day delay is section 3010(b) rather than section3004(h)(2), as noted in preamble section II.E.)  EPA also has determined that no extended capacity variance is appropriatefor the F007-F009 wastes. These wastes are generated in considerably smallervolumes than F006 and are no more difficult to treat. EPA has determinedto delay the effective date of the new standards for 30 days, however,for the same reasons as for the cyanide standard for F006. The basis forthis action is RCRA section 3004(h)(2).  <T3>Wastes from Heat Treatment Operations and Cyanide-Bearing ``P'' Wastes.</T3>EPA is also promulgating in today's final rule treatment standards forF011 and F012 cyanide-containing wastes from heat treating operations andP013, P021, P029, P030, P063, P074, P098, P099, P104, P106, and P121. Thenonwastewater treatment standards for cyanide in these wastes are promulgatedbased on the performance of electrolytic oxidation followed by alkalinechlorination. The wastewater standard is promulgated based on the performanceof alkaline chlorination.  One commenter on the proposed rule pointed out than no commercial facilitiesoffer the specific treatment trains identified as BDAT for nonwastewaters(i.e., electrolytic oxidation followed by alkaline chlorination). EPA agreesthat no commercial facilities with a treatment train consisting of electrolyticoxidation followed by alkaline chlorination were identified in the TSDRSurvey. However, EPA believes that alkaline chlorination alone will meetthe treatment standards (see the Background Document on cyanides for thebasis of this conclusion). The Agency received numerous public commentssupporting this position. Consequently, EPA included commercially availablealkaline chlorination capacity in its capacity determinations for thesewastes.  After analyzing the TSDR Survey data, EPA has determined that adequatetreatment capacity is commercially available to treat the small volumeof F011, F012, P030, P063, P074, P098, P099, P104, P106, and P121 wastes(both wastewaters and nonwastewaters) surface land disposed. (As notedabove, the nonwastewater form of the wastes are amenable to wastewatertreatment because they can by hydrated (i.e., dissolved easily.)) EPA doesnot believe that any extension is warranted for the discarded commercialchemical product wastes. They are generated in small volumes at sporadicintervals and do not have to be treated in existing treatment systems thatconceivably require major adjustments.The F011 and F012 wastes could be treated in such existing treatment systems,however, and EPA has consequently decided to delay the prohibition effectivedate for 30 days for these wastes as a result. Further, if F011 nonwastewatersand F012 nonwastewaters are commingled with electroplating nonwastewaters,the entire mixture will become subject to the lowest treatment standardfor common constituents, in this case 110 mg/kg total cyanide. This limitis not uniformly attainable for the electroplating wastes due to significantconcentrations (in some streams, at least) of complexed cyanides. Thus,EPA expects that F011 nonwastewaters and F012 nonwastewaters will be segregatedand treated separately_an appropriate result since otherwise the electroplatingwastes would interfere with the treatment of the free (i.e., non-complexed)cyanides in the heat-treating wastes. It will, however, take some timeto adjust processes to segregate these heat-treating and electroplatingwastes. Accordingly, the Agency is deferring the effective date of the110 mg/kg total cyanide standard and the 9.1 mg/kg amenable cyanide standardfor the F011 and F012 heat-treating nonwastewaters until December 8, 1989.Between July 8, 1989 and December 8, 1989 these wastes will be subjectto the same cyanide standards as the electroplating nonwastewaters, i.e.,590 mg/kg total cyanide and 30 mg/kg amenable cyanide (the alternative,which the Agency has rejected as contrary to policy and RCRA sections 3004(h) and (m), being to leave these heat-treating wastes subject to no cyanidestandard at all even though some treatment is available and achievable).The treatment standards for F010 nonwastewaters have not been changed fromthe proposal. The nonwastewater standard for total cyanide concentrationis based on incineration, and the wastewater standard is based on alkalinechlorination. EPA estimates that less than 1 million gallons a year ofF010 nonwastewater will require incineration as a result of today's finalrule. There is no shortage of this technology, nor would any short termadjustments be needed in the technology's operation. No F010 wastewaterswere identified in the TSDR Survey as being surface land disposed. Consequently,there is no basis for delaying the effective date of the prohibition andtreatment standards for these wastes. <T3>F019 Wastes. </T3>For today's final rule, EPA has decided not to finalizethe proposed standards for F019 wastewaters and nonwastewaters (see preamblesection III.A.3.a.4.). Consequently, F019 wastes will continue to be subjectto the ``soft hammer'' requirements. <T3>Wastes From Acrylonitrile Production. </T3>Nonwastewater treatmentstandards for K011, K013, and K014 wastes are being promulgated based onincineration. However, EPA is not promulgating the proposed wastewaterstandards for K011, K013, and K014. Therefore, these wastewaters will besubject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions of 40 CFR 268.8. After analyzing the TSDR Survey data, the Agency has determined that enoughcommercial incineration capacity is available to treat the less than 1million gallons of nonwastewater K011, K013, and K014 that are not injectedunderground. Therefore, EPA is not granting a national capacity extensionfor K011, K013, and K014 nonwastewaters that are surface land disposed.<T3>Wastes From Acetaldehyde Production. </T3>Nonwastewater treatment standardsfor K009 and K010 are based on incineration. For K009 and K010 wastewaters,steam stripping followed by biological treatment has been identified asBDAT. No surface disposed K009 or K010 wastes were identified from theTSDR Survey. Consequently, EPA is not granting a variance to these wastes.<T3>Wastes from the Production of Dinitrotoluene, Toluene, Diamine, andToluene Diisocyanate. </T3>For K027, K113-K116, U221, and U223 wastes,EPA is requiring the use of incineration or reuse as fuel as a method oftreatment for nonwastewaters, and carbon adsorption, incineration, or reuseas fuel as a method of treatment for wastewaters. Based on TSDR Surveydata, EPA estimates that about 8 million gallons per year of surface landdisposed nonwastewaters will require incineration as a result of today'streatment standards. No wastewaters were identified from the TSDR Surveyor from public comments as requiring alternative treatment. After analyzing the TSDR Survey data, EPA has determined that there isenough commercial capacity available to treat the K027, K113-K116, U221,and U223 nonwastewaters and wastewaters.   <ITAG tagnum="54">EPA is therefore not granting a capacity extension for surface landdisposal of these wastes. </ITAG><T3>Organophosphorus Pesticide Wastes.</T3> For K039, P040, P041, P043,P044, P062, P085, P109, P111, U058, and U087 wastes, EPA is requiring theuse of incineration as a method of treatment for nonwastewaters, and eithercarbon adsorption or incineration as a method of treatment for wastewaters.After analyzing the TSDR Survey data, EPA has determined that enough commercialcapacity is available to treat both the wastewater and nonwastewater formsof these wastes. EPA is therefore not granting a national capacity varianceto surface disposed K039, P040, P041, P043, P044, P062, P085, P109, P111,U058, and U087 wastes. For K038, K040, P039, P071, P089, P094, P097, and U235 nonwastewaters,EPA is promulgating treatment standards based on incineration/reuse asfuel. For K036, K038, K040, P039, P071, P089, P094, P097, and U235 wastewatersthe standard is based on biological treatment (today's final rule doesnot affect the ``no land disposal'' standard for K036 nonwastewaters previouslypromulgated). After analyzing the TSDR Survey data, the Agency has determinedthat enough capacity is commercially available to treat the wastewaterand nonwastewater forms of these wastes. EPA is therefore not grantinga capacity extension for wastes K036 (nonwastewaters only), K038, K040,P039, P071, P089, P094, P097, and U235. <T3>Wastes From Pigment Production.</T3> EPA is promulgating a treatmentstandard of ``no land disposal'' only for K005 and K007 nonwastewatersgenerated from the manufacturing processes listed in 40 CFR 261.32 anddisposed after June 8, 1989. At this time, EPA is not promulgating treatmentstandards for K005 and K007 wastewaters or other nonwastewaters (e.g.,``derived-from'' wastes). The TSDR Survey identified about 2 million gallonsof K005 and K007 nonwastewaters as being surface land disposed at one facility.However, as stated earlier in this preamble, EPA has determined that thiswas the only facility generating these wastes, and that the facility isno longer generating or land disposing K005 or K007.The Agency is not promulgating the proposed treatment standard of ``noland disposal'' for K002, K003, K004, K006, and K008 nonwastewaters. SinceK004 and K008 wastes are First Third wastes, their land disposal will continueto be restricted by the ``soft hammer'' provisions. Treatment standardsfor K002, K003, and K006 wastes will be established with the remainingThird Third wastes by May 8, 1990. <T3>Wastes From Chlorinated Aliphatics Production, From 1,1,1-TrichloroethaneProduction, From 2,4-D Production, and Phthalates and Phthalic AnhydrideProduction Wastes.</T3> Today EPA is promulgating treatment standards basedon incineration/reuse as fuel for F024, K023, K028, K043, K093, K094, U028,U069, U088, U102, U107, and U190 wastewaters and nonwastewaters, and forK029, K095, and K096 nonwastewaters. The wastewater forms of K029, K095,and K096 wastes are subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions. The treatmentstandards for metals in treatment residuals for F024 and K028 are basedon stabilization.The Agency estimates that less than 1 million gallons of F024, K023, K028,K029, K043, K093, K094, K095, K096, U028, U069, U088, U102, U107, and U190wastes will require commercial incineration or reuse as fuel as a resultof today's treatment standards. After analyzing the TSDR Survey data, theAgency has determined that enough incineration capacity is commerciallyavailable to treat these wastes. EPA is therefore not granting a capacityextension for surface land disposed F024, K023, K028, K029, K043, K093,K094, K095, K096, U028, U069, U088, U102, U107, and U190 wastes.<ITAG

Extension of the Effective Date for Contaminated Soil and Debris</ITAG>The Agency is today granting an extension of the effective date for certainFirst, Second, and Third Third contaminated soils and debris for whichtreatment standards established by today's rule are based on incineration.RCRA section 3004(h)(2) allows the Administrator to grant an extensionto the effective date which would otherwise apply on the basis of the earliestdate on which adequate protective capacity will be available, not to exceedtwo years ``* * * after the effective date of the prohibition which wouldotherwise apply under subsection (d), (e), (f), or (g).'' For First Thirdwastes that have heretofore been subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisionsbut for which treatment standards are being promulgated today, the Agencyis interpreting the statutory language ``* * * effective date of the prohibitionthat would otherwise apply'' to be the date treatment standards are promulgatedfor these wastes (i.e., June 8, 1989) rather than the date the ``soft hammer''provisions took effect (i.e., August 8, 1988). The Agency finds this thebest interpretation for two reasons. Extensions of the effective date arebased on the available capacity of the BDAT technology for the waste, soit is reasonable that such an extension initiate from the date treatmentstandards based on performance of BDAT are established. Furthermore, itis not the intent of the Agency to, in effect, penalize First Third wastesby allowing less time (i.e., 38 months) for the development of needed capacity,while Second and Third Third wastes in the same treatability group areallowed the maximum 48 months (assuming capacity does not become availableat an earlier date). The capacity extension, therefore, commences for First,Second, and Third Third wastes on June 8, 1989, and extends (at maximum)until June 8, 1991.For the purpose of determining whether a contaminated material is subjectto this capacity extension, soil is defined as materials that are primarilygeologic in origin such as silt, loam, or clay, and that are indigenousto the natural geological environment. In certain cases soils will be mixedwith liquids or sludges. The Agency will determine on a case-by-case basiswhether all or portions of such mixtures should be considered soil (52FR 31197, November 8, 1986).Analysis of the TSDR survey data indicated that relatively small volumesof soil contaminated with Second Third wastes were land disposed in 1986.However, the Superfund remediation program has expanded significantly sincethat time. Plans for remediation at Superfund sites indicate far greaterexcavation of soil and debris requiring treatment, including incineration,and subsequent land disposal in 1989 than in 1986. Because of the majorincrease in the Superfund remediation program, the Agency believes thatcapacity is still inadequate for incineration of Second Third contaminatedsoil and debris. Therefore, a two year extension of the effective dateis granted to Second Third contaminated soil and debris for which BDATis incineration or fuel substitution.EPA is not promulgating a national capacity variance for soil and debristhat are contaminated with any of the prohibited cyanide wastes. The treatmenttechnology on which the Agency based treatment standards is alkaline chlorination(preceded by electrolytic oxidation in certain cases involving heavilycontaminated wastes). The record for this rulemaking documents that thereis ample commercial cyanide treatment capacity providing alkaline chlorination.It is true that this is a wastewater treatment technology, and that contaminatedsoils and debris are not liquids. However, contaminated soils could beslurried into liquid form and so be treatable by this technology. The Agencyconsequently does not believe that a national capacity variance is warranted.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Capacity Determinations for Underground Injected Wastes</ITAG>The Agency received comments from 8 different parties concerning the establishmentof effective dates for underground injected wastes. The Agency is takingthis opportunity to discuss its position on the two comments which it feelsare most crucial to this rule and to the regulated community. A responseto all comments made on the January 11, 1989, proposed rule can be foundin the Response to Comments Background Document in the RCRA docket.A number of commenters indicated that treatment capacity variances shouldcommence not from the statutory deadline of RCRA section 3004(g), but ratherfrom May 8, 1990 or from an earlier date which EPA may establish by regulationafter promulgating a BDAT treatment standard (and after making a decisionon the availability of national protective treatment or disposal capacity).EPA first addressed this issue in the June 7, 1989, promulgation of effectivedates for the ban on underground injection of certain First Third wastespublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 14, 1989 (54 FR 25416). EPA adopted thecommenters' approach for the wastes addressed in that rule, and is likewiseadopting the same approach for today's rule. Briefly, RCRA section 3004(g)sets no statutory prohibitions for disposal of hazardous wastes into UICwells until May 8, 1990. Any earlier prohibition date is set by regulation.Thus, any extension of the effective date would commence from that regulatoryprohibition date, and be based on anaylsis of available adequate alternativetreatment, recovery, or disposal capacity existing as of the regulatoryprohibition date (see RCRA section 3004(h)(2)). For a further discussionof this issue, see 54 FR 25416, June 14, 1989. This decision changes theeffective dates for F007 wastewaters and nonwastewaters, and K011 and K013nonwastewaters from August 8, 1990 to June 8, 1991, as indicated in theJanuary 11, 1989 proposed rule.Commenters also requested that the Agency defer setting any section 3004(g)prohibitions for UIC wastes until May 8, 1990. As previously articulatedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 14, 1989 (54 FR 25416), the Agency disagreeswith this position. EPA believes that it is the intent of Congress to banthe disposal of section 3004(g) wastes as expeditiously as possible uponthe establishment of treatment standards and determination of alternativetreatment capacity. If capacity exists, then consistent with section 3004(g)(5),the Agency will ban the underground disposal of such waste. Facilitiesthat are able to make a demonstration of ``no migration'' in compliancewith the requirements of 40 CFR 148 and 40 CFR 268.6 or meet the treatmentstandards in Part 268 may continue to inject hazardous wastes beyond thespecified effective dates.In previous rules, the Agency used a hierarchical approach in making decisionsto allocate limited protective treatment or disposal capacity when evaluatingnational capacity variances (52 FR 32450, August 27, 1987; and 53 FR 30912,August 16, 1988). Briefly, available treatment capacity was first apportionedto demand from waste originally destined for surface disposal units, thento wastes from CERCLA remedial actions and RCRA section 3004(u) correctiveactions, and finally to wastes disposed in injection wells. For the reasonsdiscussed in the recent Final Rule for a group of First Third Wastes effectiveJune 7, 1989 and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 14, 1989 (54 FR 25416). This hierarchyhas no effect on the Agency's decisions today. The UIC wastes being prohibitedare relatively low volume. Prohibiting these small volumes of wastes willnot result in capacity becoming unavailable for either wastes that aresurface disposed, or for CERCLA/RCRA cleanup wastes.a. <T3>Effective date determinations for Second Third scheduled wastes forwhich EPA has not set treatment standards</T3>. The Agency has not settreatment standards for the Second Third wastes listed in Table III.C.3.a.These wastes are not prohibited from land disposal by underground injectionuntil the Agency sets treatment standards and effective dates, or untilMay 8, 1990, if EPA takes no action.On January 11, 1989, the Agency proposed, in part, to set treatment standardsand UIC effective dates for the following First Third wastes: F019, K011,K013, and K014. In today's rule, EPA is not finalizing the treatment standardsor effective dates for F019 wastes, and K011 wastewaters, K013 wastewaters,or K014 wastewaters. These wastes, consequently, remain subject to the``soft hammer'' provisions of 40 CFR 268.8. Similarly, the Agency proposedto set treatment standards and UIC effective dates for the following ThirdThird wastes: K002 nonwastewaters, K003 nonwastewaters, and K006 nonwastewaters.In today's rule, EPA is not finalizing these standards or effective dates.Since the statutory deadline for these wastes is May 8, 1990, and no prohibitionsare being established in today's rule, these wastes are not subject tothe land disposal restrictions until promulgation of the Third Third finalrule.Treatment standards for K004 nonwastewaters and K008 nonwastewaters werefinalized on August 16, 1988 (No Land Disposal Based on No Generation).Amendments to these standards were proposed on January 11, 1989 (No LandDisposal Based on Recycling). These treatment standards were finally amendedon May 2, 1989 (No Land Disposal Based on No Generation for forms of thesewastes generated by the process described in the waste listing descriptionand disposed after August 17, 1988, and not generated in the course oftreating wastewater forms of these wastes; 54 FR 18836). EPA is today rescindingall treatment standards for these nonwastewaters; therefore, all K004 andK008 wastes (wastewaters and nonwastewaters) are under the effect of the``soft hammer'' provisions of 40 CFR 268.8.b. <T3>Scheduled wastes with established treatment standards which currentdata indicate are not being injected.</T3> The wastes listed in Table III.C.3.b.are wastes for which standards are being established today and for whichcurrent data indicate are not being injected. No comment was received indicatingthat any of these wastes are being underground injected. Therefore, EPAis prohibiting the underground injection of these wastes unless they meetthe treatment standards on June 8, 1989. The Agency believes these decisionswill have no effect on the remaining national capacity available to treatwastes generated from RCRA/CERCLA cleanup actions requiring the type oftreatment associated with these wastes.The Agency has not established treatment standards for F006 wastewaters;accordingly, today's rule does not ban injection of F006 wastewaters. F006nonwastewaters were banned from injection on June 7, 1989 published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>, June 14, 1989 (54 FR 25416).EPA is also banning the underground injection of K009 nonwastewaters andK010 wastewaters. Data received since the January 11, 1989, proposal indicatethat these wastes are not being underground injected.c. <T3>Scheduled wastes with established treatment standards which currentdata indicate are being injected</T3>. Table III.C.3.c. lists those wasteswith treatment standards being established today which are undergroundinjected. The Table summarizes the volumes requiring alternative treatmentcapacity. Table III.C.3.d. lists effective dates for the prohibitions againstthe underground injection of these wastes. The Agency believes these decisionswill have little effect on the remaining national capacity available totreat wastes generated from RCRA/CERCLA cleanup actions requiring the typeof treatment associated with these wastes. Moreover, these waste streamsare sufficiently low volume not to affect transportation capacity for thesewastes (see 53 FR 30914, August 16, 1988).(1) Capacity determinations for injected wastes requiring alkaline chlorinationor electrolytic oxidation followed by alkaline chlorination (F007, F008,F009, F011, F012, P029, P030, P063, and P098). The wastewater treatmentstandards for F007, F008, F009, F011, F012, P029, P030, and P098 are basedon alkaline chlorination. The nonwastewater treatment standards for F007,F008, and F009 are based on alkaline chlorination followed by precipitation.The treatment standards for F011, F012, P029, P030, P063, and P098 nonwastewatersare based on electrolytic oxidation followed by alkaline chlorination.(As indicated in preamble section III.C.1.c., no commercial facilitieswith a treatment train consisting of electrolytic oxidation followed byalkaline chlorination were identified in the TSDR Survey. The Agency believesthat alkaline chlorination alone will be able to meet the BDAT treatmentstandards for F011, F012, P029, P030, P063, and P098 nonwastewaters.) An estimated 130 million gallons per year of these wastes will requirecyanide wastewater treatment. Of the 130 million gallons, approximately128 million gallons are being disposed by underground injection. TableIII.C.3.c. gives the volumes of wastes injected for the indicated wastecodes. These wastes may be injected in individual streams or as mixturesof wastes.There is no need to use the allocation hierarchy in this situaiton. A straightcomparison of available versus required capacity indicates a shortfallin alkaline chlorination capacity for injected F007 wastewaters and nonwastewaters(33 million gallons available versus 128 million gallons of injected F007).Comments received on the proposed effective date supported that determination.The Agency is therefore granting a two-year national capacity variancefor F007 wastes which are underground injected. As indicated earlier inthe preamble, EPA will grant a two-year variance not from the August 8,1988 statutory First Third deadline, but rather from the effective dateof this rule.Over 33 million gallons per year of available alternate commercial treatmentcapacity has been identified for the low volumes of F008, F009, F011, F012,P029, P030, and P098 wastewaters and nonwastewaters being injected; therefore,no capacity variances were proposed for these wastes. No comment was receivedon this action. The Agency is banning the underground injection of P029,P030, and P098 wastes upon promulgation of this rule. As indicated in preamblesection III.C.1.a., EPA is granting 30-day extensions of the effectivedate for F008, F009, F011, and F012 wastes. These wastes will thereforebe banned from underground injection on July 8, 1989. (See preamble sectionIII.C.1.a. describing the bifurcated treatment standard for F011 nonwastewatersand F012 nonwastewaters).P063 wastes are reported in the TSDR survey as part of mixed waste streamswith K011, K013, and K014. In the proposal EPA requested information onthe quantities of P063 being underground injected, indicating a beliefthat such wastes are being injected in much smaller quantities than thedata in the TSDR survey might suggest. Information received since thisrule was proposed indicates that only relatively small amounts of P063are being disposed by underground injection. Consequently EPA is banningthe underground injection of P063 wastes upon the promulgation of thisrule. (2) Capacity determination for injected P071, P089, U028, U088, U107, andU190. Treatment standards for P071 and P089 nonwastewaters, and U028, U088,U107, and U190 wastewaters and nonwastewaters are based on incineration.Treatment standards for P071 and P089 wastewaters are based on biologicaltreatment.These wastes are currently injected in low volumes, if at all (see TableIII.C.3.c.). The Agency has determined that adequate treatment capacityexists for these wastes (281 million gallons of available capacity and44 million gallons of available biological treatment capacity versus amaximum of 300,000 gallons injected). No comments were received on theproposed effective dates. The Agency is therefore banning the undergroundinjection of these wastes upon promulgation of this rule.(3) Capacity determination for injected K009 wastewaters and K010 nonwastewaters.On January 11, 1989, the Agency proposed to grant capacity variances forall K009 and K010 wastes. New information indicates that only K009 wastewatersand K010 nonwastewaters are being injected. The Agency is setting treatmentstandards for K009 wastewaters based on steam stripping followed by biologicaltreatment. Treatment standards for K010 nonwastewaters are based on incineration.Inadequate alternative treatment capacity exists to treat the K009 wastewatersthat are annually being injected (0 gallons of capacity available versusapproximately 79 million gallons injected). There is adequate alternativetreatment capacity to treat the K010 nonwastewaters that are being injectedannually (281 million gallons of capacity available versus approximately5 million gallons injected). Consequently, EPA is today granting a two-yearcapacity variance to the prohibition of underground injection of K009 wastewaters.The underground injection of K010 nonwastewaters is banned on June 8, 1989.As indicated previously, K009 nonwastewaters and K010 wastewaters not meetingthe treatment standards are banned on June 8, 1989, based upon assessmentof the best data available to the Agency, which indicate that these wastesare not being underground injected.(4) Capacity determination for injected K011 nonwastewaters, K013 nonwastewaters,and K014 nonwastewaters. A significant volume of K011 nonwastewaters andK013 nonwastewaters (wastes from acrylonitrile production) are currentlybeing land disposed by underground injection. Treatment standards for thesewastes are based on incineration. The data indicate that approximately282 million gallons of commercial incineration capacity exists versus 347million gallons of injected K011 nonwastewaters and K013 nonwastewatersrequiring incineration.The Agency received extensive support for the proposed capacity variancefor these waste codes. As indicated earlier in the preamble, EPA will granta two-year variance not from the August 8, 1988, statutory First Thirddeadline, but rather from the effective date of this rule. K011 nonwastewatersand K013 nonwastewaters will be banned from underground injection on June8, 1991. At proposal, EPA had treated K011, K013, and K014 injected nonwastewatersas one nonsegregable treatability group for the purpose of the nationalcapacity determination. Upon further evaluation, EPA believes injectedK014 nonwastewaters are segregable from K011 and K013 injected nonwastewaters.EPA plans to publish a notice to provide an opportunity to comment on thisissue and will set an effective date for injected K014 nonwastewaters afterevaluating comments. Thus, EPA is not taking final action on the proposalfor setting an effective date for injected K014 nonwastewaters. Until finalaction, injected K014 nonwastewaters remain under the effect of the ``softhammer'' provisions of 40 CFR 268.8. (5) Capacity determination for injected U221, U223, and P044 Wastes. TableIII.C.3.c. indicates that approximately 27 million gallons per year ofU221 wastes are being injected underground, and additional volumes of U223and P044 wastes are being injected in mixed waste streams. Treatment standardsfor P044 nonwastewaters, and U221 and U223 wastewaters and nonwastewatersare based on incineration. Treatment standards for P044 wastewaters arebased on carbon adsorption or incineration. The data indicates that thereis adequate treatment capacity for both injected nonwastewaters and wastewaters(282 million gallons of incineration capacity available versus 27 milliongallons injected; 2 million gallons of carbon adsorption capacity availableversus andless;100,000 injected). No national capacity variances were proposedfor U221, U223 or P044 wastes. No comment was received on this decision.The Agency is therefore banning the underground injection of U221, U223,and P044 on June 8, 1989, unless these wastes meet the treatment standards.<ITAG tagnum="74">Table III.C.3.a._Second Third Wastes for Which Treatment StandardsAre Not Established</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">K025 (wastewaters), K029 (wastewaters), K041, K042, K095 (wastewaters),K096 (wastewaters), K097, K098, K105</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="20">P002, P003, P007, P008, P014, P026, P027, P049, P054, P057, P060,P066, P067, P072, P107, P112, P113, P114</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="20">U002, U003, U005, U008, U011, U014, U015, U020, U021, U023, U025,U026, U032, U035, U047, U049, U057, U059, U060, U062, U070, U073, U080,U083, U092, U093, U094, U095, U097, U098, U099, U101, U106, U109, U110,U111, U114, U116, U119, U127, U128, U131, U135, U138, U140, U142, U143,U144, U146, U147, U149, U150, U161, U162, U163, U164, U165, U168, U169,U170, U172, U173, U174, U176, U178, U179, U189, U193, U196, U203, U205,U206, U208, U213, U214, U215, U216, U217, U218, U239, U244</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Table III.C.3.b._Wastes for Which Treatment Standards Are Today Establishedand Which Are Not Underground Injected </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">(Banned from underground injection on June 8, 1989)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">First Third</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">K036 (wastewaters), P039, P041, P094, P097</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="26">Second Third</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">F010, F024, K009 (nonwastewaters), K010 (wastewaters), K027, K028,K029 (nonwastewaters), K038, K039, K040, K043, K095 (nonwastewaters), K096(nonwastewaters), P040, P043, P062, P074, P085, P104, P106, P111, U058,U235</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="26"> Third Third</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">K005 (nonwastewaters), K007 (nonwastewaters), K023, K093, K094, P013,P021, P099, P109, P121, U069, U087, U102</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="26">Newly Listed Wastes</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">K113, K114, K115, K116</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>III.C.3.c._<T4>Wastes for Which Treatment Standards Are Today Established and WhichAre Being Underground Injected</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Millions of gallons per year]</ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Volume of injected waste requiring treatment capacity</H1>First Third:<ITAG tagnum="3">F007 </ITAG><D>\1\ 127.6</D><ITAG tagnum="3">F008 </ITAG><D>\1\ andless;0.1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">F009 </ITAG><D>\1\ andless;0.1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">K011 nonwastewaters </ITAG><D>\1\ 173.4</D><ITAG tagnum="3">K013 nonwastewaters </ITAG><D>\1\ 173.4</D><ITAG tagnum="3">P030 </ITAG><D>\1\ andless;0.1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">P063 </ITAG><D>\1\ andless;0.1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">P071 </ITAG><D>\1\ andless;0.1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">P089 </ITAG><D>\1\ andless;0.1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">U221 </ITAG><D>\1\ 26.8</D><ITAG tagnum="3">U223 </ITAG><D>\1\ andless;0.1</D>Second Third:<ITAG tagnum="3">F011 </ITAG><D>\1\ 0.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">F012 </ITAG><D>\1\ 0.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">K009 wastewaters </ITAG><D>79.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">K010 nonwastewaters </ITAG><D>5.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">P029 </ITAG><D>\1\ andless;0.1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">P044 </ITAG><D>\1\ 0.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">P098 </ITAG><D>\1\ andless;0.1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">U028 </ITAG><D>\1\ 0.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">U107 </ITAG><D>\1\ andless;0.1</D>Third Third:<ITAG tagnum="3">U088 </ITAG><D>\1\ 0.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">U190 </ITAG><D>andless;0.1</D><F>\1\ Indicates wastes are injected in mixed waste streams.

State Authority</ITAG>A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized StatesUnder section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administerand enforce the RCRA program within the State. Following authorization,EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 ofRCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility.The standards and requirements for authorization are found in 40 CFR Part271.Prior to HSWA, a State with final authorization administered its hazardouswaste program in lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in thatState. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized State,and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities that the State was authorizedto permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgatedor enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority withinspecified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect inan authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.In contrast, under RCRA section 3006(g) (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)), new requirementsand prohibitions imposed by HSWA take effect in authorized States at thesame time that they take effect in nonauthorized States. EPA is directedto carry out these requirements and prohibitions in authorized States,including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorizationto do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as Statelaw to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States inthe interim.Today's rule is promulgated pursuant to sections 3004(d) through (k), and(m), of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6924(d) through (k), and (m)). Therefore, it willbe added to Table 1 in 40 CFR 271.1(j), which identifies the Federal programrequirements that are promulgated pursuant to HSWA and take effect in allStates, regardless of their authorization status. States may apply foreither interim or final authorization for the HSWA provisions in Table1, as discussed in the following section. When this rule is promulgated,Table 2 in 40 CFR 271.1(j) will be modified also to indicate that thisrule is a self-implementing provision of HSWA.B. Effect on State AuthorizationsAs noted above, EPA will implement today's final rule in authorized Statesuntil their programs are modified to adopt these rules and the modificationis approved by EPA. Because the rule is promulgated pursuant to HSWA, aState submitting a program modification may apply to receive either intermor final authorization under RCRA section 3006(g)(2) or 3006(b), respectively,on the basis of requirements that are substantially equivalent or equivalentto EPA's. The procedures and schedule for State program modifications foreither interim or final authorization are described in 40 CFR 271.21. Itshould be noted that HSWA interim authorization will expire on January1, 1993 (see 40 CFR 271.24(c)).Section 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final authorizationmust modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and mustsubsequently submit the modification to EPA for approval. The deadlineby which the State must modify its program to adopt this regulation willbe determined by the promulgation of the final rule in accordance withandSection; 271.21(e). These deadlines can be extended in certain cases (seeandSection; 271.21(e)(3)). Once EPA approves the modification, the Staterequirements become Subtitle C RCRA requirements.States with authorized RCRA programs may already have requirements similarto those in today's final rule. These State regulations have not been assessedagainst the Federal regulations being promulgated today to determine whetherthey meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not authorizedto implement these requirements in lieu of EPA until the State programmodification is approved. Of course, States with existing standards maycontinue to administer and enforce their standards as a matter of Statelaw. In implementing the Federal program, EPA will work with States underagreements to minimize duplication of efforts. In many cases, EPA willbe able to defer to the States in their efforts to implement their programsrather than take separate actions under Federal authority.States that submit official applications for final authorization less than12 months after the effective date of these regulations are not requiredto include standards equivalent to these regulations in their application.However, the State must modify its program by the deadline set forth inandSection; 271.21(e). States that submit official applications for finalauthorization 12 months after the effective date of these regulations mustinclude standards equivalent to these regulations in their application.The requirements a State must meet when submitting its final authorizationapplication are set forth in 40 CFR 271.3. The amendments being promulgated today need not affect the State's UndergroundInjection Control (UIC) primacy status. A State currently authorized toadminister the UIC program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) couldcontinue to do so without seeking authority to administer these amendments.However, a State which wished to implement Part 148 and receive authorizationto grant exemptions from the land disposal restrictions would have to demonstratethat it had the requisite authority to administer sections 3004(f) and(g) of RCRA. The conditions under which such an authorization may takeplace are summarized below and are discussed in a July 15, 1985 final rule(50 FR 28728). C. State ImplementationThe following four aspects of the framework established in the November7, 1986, rule (51 FR 40572) affect State implementation to today's finalrule and impact State actions on the regulated community:1. Under Part 268, Subpart C, EPA is proposing land disposal restrictionsfor all generators, treaters, storers, and disposers of certain types ofhazardous waste. In order to retain authorization, States must adopt theregulations under this Subpart since State requirements can be no lessstringent than Federal requirements.2. Also under Part 268, EPA is proposing to grant two-year national variancesfrom the effective dates of the land disposal restrictions based on ananalysis of available alternative treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity.Under section 268.5, case-by-case extensions of up to one year (renewablefor one additional year) may be granted for specific applicants lackingadequate capacity.The Administrator of EPA is solely responsible for granting variances tothe effective dates because these determinations must be made on a nationalbasis. In addition, it is clear that RCRA section 3004(h)(3) intends forthe Administrator to grant case-by-case extensions after consulting theaffected States, on the basis of national concerns which only the Administratorcan evaluate. Therefore, States cannot be authorized for this aspect ofthe program.3. Under andSection;268.44, the Agency may grant waste-specific variancesfrom treatment standards in cases where it can be demonstrated that thephysical and/or chemical properties of the wastes differ significantlyfrom wastes analyzed in developing the treatment standards, and the wastescannot be treated to specified levels or treated by specified methods.The Agency is solely responsible for granting such variances since theresult of such an action may be the establishment of a new waste treatabilitygroup. All wastes meeting the criteria of these new waste treatabilitygroups may also be subject to the treatment standard established by thevariance. Granting such variances may have national impacts; therefore,this aspect of the program is not delegated to the States at this time.4. Under andSection;268.6, EPA may grant petitions of specific duration toallow land disposal of certain hazardous wastes where it can be demonstratedthat there will be no migration of hazardous constituents for as long asthe waste remains hazardous. States which have the authority to imposerestrictions may be authorized under RCRA section 3006 to grant petitionsfor exemptions from the restrictions. Decisions on site-specific petitionsdo not require the national perspective required to restrict wastes orgrant extensions. EPA will be handling ``no migration'' petitions at Headquarters,though the States may be authorized to grant these petitions in the future.The Agency expects to gain valuable experience and information from reviewof ``no migration'' petitions which may affect future land disposal restrictionsrulemakings. In accordance with RCRA section 3004(i), EPA will publishnotice of the Agency's final decision on petitions in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.States are free to impose their own disposal restrictions if such actionsare more stringent or broader in scope than the actions of Federal programs(RCRA section 3009 and 40 CFR 271.1(i)). Where States impose such restrictions,the broader and more stringent State restrictions govern.<ITAG tagnum="85">V. Effect Of the Land Disposal Restrictions Program on Other EnvironmentalPrograms</ITAG>A. Discharges Regulated Under the Clean Water ActAs a result of the land disposal restrictions program, some generatorsmight switch from land disposal of restricted Second Third wastes to dischargeto publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs) in order to avoid incurring thecosts of alternative treatment. In shifting from land disposal to dischargeto POTWs, an increase in human and environmental risks could occur. Alsoas a result of the land disposal restrictions, hazardous waste generatorsmight illegally discharge their wastes to surface waters without treatment,which could cause damage to the local ecosystem and potentially pose healthrisks from direct exposure or bioaccumulation.Some generators might treat their wastes prior to discharging to a POTW,but the treatment step itself could increase risks to the environment.For example, if incineration were the pretreatment step, metals and otherhazardous constituents present in air scrubber waters could be dischargedto surface waters. However, the amount of Second Third waste shifted toPOTWs would be limited by such factors as the physical form of the waste,the degree of pretreatment required prior to discharge, and State and localregulations.B. Discharges Regulated Under the Marine Protection, Research, and SanctuariesActManagement of some of the hazardous wastes included in today's rulemakingcould be shifted from land disposal to ocean dumping and ocean-based incineration.If the cost of ocean-based disposal plus transportation were lower thanthe cost of land-based treatment, disposal, and transportation, this optioncould become an attractive alternative. In addition, ocean-based disposalcould become attractive to the regulated community if land-based treatmentwere not available.However, the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 has restricted ocean dumpingof sewage sludge and industrial wastes to existing, authorized dumpersuntil December 31, 1991, after which ``... it shall be unlawful for anyperson to dump (sewage sludge or industrial wastes) into ocean waters''.Therefore, the Ocean Dumping Ban Act has made moot any economic or otherincentive to ocean dump industrial hazardous wastes, including the wastessubject to this regulation.C. Air Emissions Regulated Under the Clean Air ActSome treatment technologies applicable to Second Third wastes could resultin cross-media transfer of hazardous constituents to air. For example,incineration of metal-bearing wastes could result in metal emissions toair. Some constituents, such as chromium, can be more toxic if inhaledthan if ingested. Therefore, it might be necessary to issue regulatorycontrols for some technologies to ensure they are operated properly.The Agency has taken several steps to address this issue. EPA has initiateda program to address metal emissions from incinerators. It has also initiatedtwo programs under section 3004(n) to address air emissions from othersources. The first program will address fugitive emissions from equipmentsuch as pumps, valves, and vents from units processing concentrated organicwaste streams. The second program will address other sources of air emissions,such as tanks and waste transfer and handling.D. Clean Up Actions Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability ActThe land disposal restrictions may have significant effects on the selectionand implementation of response actions that are taken under the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Thereare three primary areas in which these effects may occur.One area that may be affected by the LDR is in the selection of treatmentstandards at the remedial action site. The cleanup standards set at CERCLAsites are risk-based, while treatment standards developed under the landdisposal restrictions program are technology-based. Therefore, the technology-basedtreatment standards may be more stringent than the risk-based cleanup standardsdeveloped based on the CERCLA selection of remedy criteria, and vice versa.Another matter that may be affected is the treatment of soil and debriscontaminated with wastes restricted from land disposal. Contaminated soiland debris are a primary type of waste that must be remediated at mostCERCLA sites. In many cases, the soil matrix is different from that ofthe industrial waste for which treatment standards are set. CERCLA sitemanagers must either comply with the treatment standards or request andbe granted a variance from the treatment standard (andSection;268.44) orrequest and be granted a ``no-migration'' variance (andSection;268.6).Finally, even though the hazardous substances at a CERCLA remediation sitemay have been disposed prior to the effective date of RCRA, if the actioninvolves removal of restricted wastes after the prohibition effective date,the land disposal restrictions are legally applicable (51 FR 40577). Forexample, if a waste is excavated from a unit, treated, and redisposed,EPA has indicated that ``placement'' (see RCRA section 3004(k)) of thewaste in a land disposal unit has occurred and the applicable treatmentstandards must be met (see 53 FR 51444 and 51445, Dec. 21, 1988). However,if the waste is capped in place, removal or ``placement'' has not occurredand the treatment standards are not legally applicable.E. Applicability of Treatment Standards to Wastes from Pesticides RegulatedUnder the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide ActA number of generators of pesticide waste that have heretofore been comparativelyunaware of the land disposal restrictions may be regulated when today'srulemaking is promulgated. This will require that the Agency develop guidancematerials and provide training on how to comply with the requirements ofthe land disposal restrictions.Generators of significant quantities of pesticide P and U wastes are farmersand commercial pesticide applicators. The provisions of 40 CFR 268.1(c)(5)exempt farmers from regulation under the land disposal restrictions program;however, no such exemption exists for commercial applicators. Such generatorsof hazardous wastes have traditionally land disposed their pesticide wastes.Subsequent to promulgation of today's final rule, these generators mustcomply with the requirements of the land disposal restrictions if theydispose a hazardous waste subject to treatment standards of ``soft hammer''provisions.F. Regulatory Overlap of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Under the ToxicSubstance Control Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery ActCertain wastes listed as P or U contain PCBs. The PCB component of sucha waste mixture is regulated primarily under TSCA, whereas the listed Por U component of the waste is regulated under RCRA. Such a mixture oflisted/PCB waste must meet the applicable requirements under both statutes.Such a waste must ordinarily go to an incinerator permitted under bothTSCA and RCRA. Any ash residual from incineration must meet the treatmentstandard for the listed waste component prior to land disposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact Analysis<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Purpose</ITAG>The Agency estimated the costs, benefits, and economic impacts of today'sfinal rule to determine if it is a ``major'' regulation as defined by ExecutiveOrder No. 12291. For all major rules, the Agency is required by the ExecutiveOrder to conduct a Regulatory Impact Analysis, and by the Regulatory FlexibilityAct to assess small business impacts. The cost and economic impact estimatesserve, additionally, as measures of the practical capability of facilitiesto comply with the final rule.The results indicate that today's final rule is not a major rule. Thissection of the preamble discusses the results of the analyses of the finalrule.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Executive Order No. 12291</ITAG>Executive Order No. 12291 requires EPA to assess the effect of final Agencyactions and alternatives during the development of regulations. Such anassessment consists of a quantification of the potential benefits and costsof the rule, as well as a description of any beneficial or adverse effectsthat cannot be quantified in monetary terms. In addition, Executive OrderNo. 12291 requires that regulatory agencies prepare a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis (RIA) for major rules. Major rules are defined as those likelyto result in:andbullet; An annual cost to the economy of $100 million or more; orandbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individualindustries; orandbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,innovation, or international trade.The Agency has conducted cost analysis and has concluded that the finalrule is not a major rule. Annual costs to the economy are estimated atapproximately $24.9 million to $32.4 million for wastes not injected undergroundand an additional $3.9 million for those injected underground.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Basic Approach</ITAG>The Agency analyzed costs and benefits using the same approach and methodologythat was used for the August 17, 1988 First Third final rule (53 FR 31138).The effects of the final rule were estimated by comparing post-regulatorycosts, benefits, and economic impacts with those resulting under baselineconditions. The baseline for all Second and Third wastes is defined ascontinued land disposal of wastes in units meeting minimum technologicalrequirements. The baseline was not adjusted to reflect treatment requirementsthat would automatically occur in the absence of a rule after May 8, 1990.The baseline for First Third wastes included in this rule is defined astreatment needed to comply with the First Third Land Disposal Restrictionsrule or the soft hammer provisions that went into effect on August 8, 1988.This baseline corresponds to treatments evaluated under Alternative A Scenario2 in the First Thirds RIA (53 FR 31138, August 17, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="81">4.

An additional 8 facilities wouldbe affected by the soft hammer provisions that will take effect on June8, 1989.Only 20 injection facilities will be required to either treat wastes orfile ``no migration'' petitions. These facilities will not significantlycontribute to compliance costs already incurred by injection well owners/operatorsmanaging solvents, dioxins, California list, and First Third wastes.<T3>b. Costs.</T3> The standards promulgated by this final rule are estimatedto cost industry $24.9 million per year for surface-disposed wastes, and3.9 million per year for injected wastes. If there is not enough capacityto treat the wastes subject to the soft hammer provisions, the facilitiesmay be able to continue managing their wastes in minimum technology unitsat no additional cost.If treatment capacity is available, surface-disposed wastes subject tothe soft hammer provisions would need to be treated. The Agency estimatedthe upper range costs of treating those wastes by assuming these wasteswould be incinerated. This treatment could add as much as $7.5 millionto the cost of the rule. Less costly forms of treatment would be availablefor the soft hammered wastes, which would reduce the cost.In general, the Agency assumed that the least costly treatment would beselected. This assumption had negligible effects on the estimated costsexcept for the case of a combined waste stream containing K027 and D007,a Third Third chromium waste. The Agency assumed that the combined wastewould be treated to comply with the final rule. The Agency also assumedthat no treatment of the residual scrubber sludges to remove chromium wouldtake place because treatment standards for D007 have not been promulgated.Promulgation of standards for D007 under the Third Third rule would increasecosts for this combined waste by approximately $28 million annually.The additional volume of injected wastes attributable to the Second Thirdschedule is small by comparison to the volumes of wastes regulated by previousrulemakings. The Agency performed an analysis to assess the economic effectof associated compliance costs for Second Third wastes and found totalcompliance costs to be $3.9 million annually and petition costs are estimatedat $0.1 million annually.c. <T3>Economic impacts.</T3> The economic impact analysis for surface-disposedwastes estimates that none of the affected facilities would be significantlyaffected by the final rule. None of the affected facilities is expectedto close as a result of the rule.d. <T3>Benefits.</T3> The benefits analysis for surface-disposed wastes estimatedthat, over a 70 year lifetime, the final rule would reduce the number ofcancer cases by 0.07 and the number of exposures to noncarcinogenic chemicalsabove threshold levels by 555.Benefits other than reduction in human health risk_such as resouce damageavoided and corrective action costs avoided_were not quantified. As a result,the benefits of the land disposal restrictions for Second Third wastesare likely to be understated.B. Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.,</T3> whenever an agency is required to publish a notice ofrulemaking for a final rule, it must prepare and make available for publiccomment a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) that describes the effectof the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations,and small governmental jurisdictions). This analysis is unnecessary, however,if the Agency's Administrator certifies that the rule will not have a significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities.According to EPA's guidelines for conducting an RFA, if over 20 percentof the population of small businesses, small organizations, or small governmentjurisdictions is likely to experience financial distress based on the costsof the rule, then the agency is required to consider that the rule willhave a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities andto perform a formal RFA. EPA evaluated the economic effect of the finalrule, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and determined thatno facilities would be significantly affected. The Administrator certifiesthat Part 268 and Part 148 will not have significant economic effects ona substantial number of small entities. As a result of this finding, theAgency has not prepared a formal RFA.C. Paperework Reduction ActAll information collection requirements in this final rule were promulgatedin previous land disposal restrictions rulemakings (other than those forthe Underground Injection Control Program) and approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget at that time. Since there are no new informationcollection requirements being promulgated today, an Information CollectionRequest has not been prepared.For the Underground Injection Control Program, the information collectionrequirements in this final rule have been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) under the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act,</T3> 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> Reporting and recordkeeping burden on the public for thiscollection is estimated at 745 hours for the respondents, with an averageof 14 hours per response. These burden estimates include all aspects ofthe collection effort and may include time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden,(please reference ICR No. 370.09), to Chief, Information Policy Branch,PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington,DC 20460 (202-382-2745); and Office of Management and Budget, PaperworkReduction Project (2040-0042), Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention:Desk Officer for EPA.''D. Review of Supporting DocumentsThe primary source of information on current land disposal practices andindustries affected by this rule was EPA's 1986 ``National Survey of HazardousWaste Treatment, Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Facilities (the TSDRSurvey). The average quantity of waste contributed by generator facilitieswas obtained from EPA's ``National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generatorsand Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities Regulated under RCRA in1981'' (April 1984).<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
