These procedures were previously publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 26, 1983 (48 FR 43731). The revisionsproposed in this notice will revise andSection;5.1 to reflect recent organizationalchanges in the BLM; will update the list of cross-referenced regulationsin andSection;5.2; will delete from andSection;5.3 obsolete items in the listof BLM actions that normally require the preparation of an environmentalimpact statement (EIS); and will update in andSection;5.4 the list of BLMactions that are categorically excluded from NEPA documentation unlessthe action qualifies as an exception under 516 DM 2.3A(3).The proposed list of BLM actions that normally require the preparationof an EIS differs from the existing list in three respects: 1. Approval of court ordered grazing and timber management activity planshas been deleted from the list as the BLM has filed all of the grazingand timber management EIS's it was scheduled to prepare. The impacts ofthese activities are now addressed through the EIS's the BLM prepares inconjunction with its resource management plans. 2. Issuance of coal preference right leases has been added to the list.3. Proposals for wilderness, wild and scenic rivers and national trailshave been added to the list. The proposed list of categorically excluded actions differs from the existinglist in several respects: 1. A number of existing categorical exclusions have been deleted. Somehave been deleted because they are obsolete. Others have been deleted becausethe actions in question are covered by one of the categories on the existingDepartmental list (appendix 1 of 516 DM 2). Still others have been deletedbecause the activities in question are now being addressed in the EIS'sthe BLM prepares in conjunction with its resource management plans or inprogrammatic environmental documents. 2. A number of the existing categorical exclusions have been revised. Someexclusions included unnecessary qualifiers which have been removed. Othershave been revised to more clearly specify the category of activity thatis being excluded. 3. A number of new exclusions have been added, including 5.4.A(3)-(6),5.4.B(2), 5.4.C(6), 5.4.D(1)-(9), and 5.4.H(1)-(3). The agency has determined,based on its experience that these categories of actions do not individuallyor cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. 4. The order in which the exclusions are presented has been changed. Theexisting list is subdivided into nine sections: General, Realty, Transportation,Minerals, Recreation, Rangeland Management, Forestry, Wildlife, and Other.In the revised list, the sections appear in the following order: Fish andWildlife, Fluid Minerals, Forestry, Rangeland Management, Realty, SolidMinerals, Transportation and Signs, and Other. Comments on these proposed revisions are invited. To be considered in thepreparation of the final revision, comments must be received by January2, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 31, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan McClean, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Office of Environmental Project Review, Office of the Secretary,U.S. Department of the Interior. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">516 DM 6_Appendix 5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>Sections 5.1A through 5.1C are revised to read as follows: A.
