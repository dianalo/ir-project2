(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush got the win he so badly neededin New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary Tuesday andproclaimed ``reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.'' BobDole fumed over what he called campaign distortions and told Bush,``Quit lying about my record.''   ``Thank you, New Hampshire,'' Bush said, apt words of gratitudeto the state that revived his presidential hopes. ``On to theSouth, where we're going to rise again.''   Dole accused Bush's campaign of distorting his record in aflurry of late television commercials aired in New Hampshire. TheKansas senator said the ads unfairly accused him of backing an oilimport fee and trying to raise taxes. After complaining for much ofthe evening, he was asked if he had anything to say to Bush duringa live interview with both men on NBC-TV.   ``Yeah, quit lying about my record,'' Dole said. ``I'm not forraising anybody's taxes and he knows that; I'm not advocating a $10oil import fee, and he knows that _ but they were on the ads allweekend.''   Dole also said he regretted not answering Bush more forcefullyduring the waning days of the New Hampshire campaign, saying he hadbeen ``too kind.''   Bush led with 38 percent to Dole's 29 percent, with allprecincts reporting.   The remaining three GOP candidates lagged far behind _ New YorkRep. Jack Kemp at 13 percent, former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont at10 percent and former television evangelist Pat Robertson at 10percent   A sixth candidate, Alexander Haig, dropped out of the raceFriday and registered less than 1 percent.   Kemp claimed he was in third place and sought to make that soundlike a victory. ``We won the contest for the conservative wing, andnow we're going to contest fo the whole nomination of theRepublican Party,'' Kemp said.   Robertson looked ahead to primaries in the South, saying he hadcompeted in Dole's backyard of Iowa and Bush's in New Hampshire.``Tomorrow morning we go into the South and they're going to beplaying in my backyard,'' Robertson said.   He pointed to South Carolina, which holds a GOP primary threedays before the rest of the South votes on Super Tuesday March 8.``I'm going to beat you there convincingly,'' he said to his rivals.   Du Pont also contended he was in the running with Kemp andRobertson for third place. He called it ``a virtual tie'' amongthose three and said, ``That's got to be good.''   Dole said: ``It's better to win, and I congratulate the winner.I can stand here with my head held high.''   Dole said Bush had distorted his record by accusing him ofbacking tax increases. Dole, who was battling a reputation as aslashing campaigner earned in his 1976 vice presidential race,suggested he may come back at Bush as the campaign turns to theSouth in the coming three weeks.   ``I think we should have answered the charges. I mean, I thinkyou can be too kind to your opponent and we were,'' Dole said.``They kept saying Bob Dole wants to raise taxes. They know thatwas not accurate. ... We wanted to keep it positive and see if itworked.   ``It's unfortunate that the vice president of the United States,who knows better, would sink to that level,'' Dole said.   Asked later about Dole's accusing remark, Bush said: ``I don'tknow what he's talking about.'' But Bush's campaign in Washingtonissued a statement quoting Bush four times over the last six monthssaying he would support the oil tax.   Dole has said he would consider the oil import fee but wouldrebate the fee to homeowners who use oil for heat.   Bush's victory came after his once-strong advantage in the pollshad evaporated following his dismal showing in Iowa a week ago.Dole forces pointed to that comeback, even as it fell short.   ``We were down more than 20 points eight days ago,'' said Dolecampaign manager William Brock. ``To have come this close is atremendous commentary on Bob Dole and also ... on the softness ofthe vice president's supporters.   ``If he is going to have this kind of a problem in the South ...he's got a real problem,'' Brock said.   Earlier in the day, Bush said ``things have dramatically turnedaround'' for him in New Hampshire, just as they did for RonaldReagan in 1980.   Bush pointed cheerfully to the traditional first returns thatwere counted just after midnight in tiny Dixville Notch in thestate's northern mountains. There he was a winner, with 11 votes toDole's 6.   Bush's once-substantial lead in polls in the state evaporatedfollowing Dole's two-to-one victory over him in Iowa's caucuses aweek earlier. But daily polling by the television networksindicated the trend to Dole tailed off by the weekend and the racestabilized into a virtual dead heat.   Bush also found comfort in New Hampshire's history of rejectingIowa winners _ including himself in 1980.   ``He did what I did in 1980,'' Bush said of Dole. ``He won inIowa and came in and talked about momentum. I did what PresidntReagan did. He came in and started talking the issues'' afterlosing to Bush in Iowa.   Bush searched urgently following his Iowa debacle for a way tobetter deliver his message _ that he is the logical heir toReagan's conservative legacy.   He was an insulated candidate who rarely made contact withreporters in Iowa, a time when he was beset with questions over hisrole in sales of U.S. missiles to Iran. But with his politialfuture on the line after the Iowa defeat, Bush began asking forvotes with apparent emotion and uncharacteristically climbed intothe cab of a big truck and drove a forklift to try to display acommon man's touch.</TEXT></DOC>
