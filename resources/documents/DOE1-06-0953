With the clinical suspicion of a fractured vertebra conventionalX-ray pictures (a.p. and lateral) are necessary for the appropriate localizatonand initial orientaton. With the determination of a vertebral fractureof uncertain mass in the X-ray picture then a computed tomographic examinationas the next diagnostic step becomes necessary. Further conventional radiodiagnosticmeasures, such as tomography or additional examinations to exclude accompanyinginjuries, have been primarily replaced by computed tomography. One singleexception is the function exposure with solely disco-ligamentary injuries,which primarily are found in the neck spinal column area. The computedtomography allows for a satisfactory/assurance of diagnosis by: 1. evaluationof vertebral posterior wall; 2. evaluation of the spinal cord and 3.evaluation of the vertebral joints. Furthermore, computed tomographyallows for the exclusion of epidural bleedings as well as of other concomitantsymptoms with polytraumatized patients, for example intracranial, intraabdominaland intrathoracal concomitant injuries.</TEXT></DOC>
