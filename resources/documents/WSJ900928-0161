The forecast was the latest in a flurry of gloomyassessments about the decline in the health of the nation'sbanks. While failures on the scale of the savings and loanmess aren't expected, the news has been sour enough to pushCongress, regulatory agencies and the Bush administration toplow ahead with plans to reform the nation's depositinsurance system and restructure the industry.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;These reports create a healthy sense of alarm,&quot; saidRobert Litan, a banking expert with the Brookings Institutionwho said the sense of urgency also has prompted legislatorsand lobbyists to show greater flexibility as reform proposalsmove through Congress.   &quot;There has been a remarkable degree of consensus in someareas,&quot; he said. All the pending proposals would, to somedegree, shift risk from the insurance fund to depositors andthe banks.   Even before the new loss forecasts were announced, theFDIC planned to raise insurance premiums that banks pay to19.5 cents per $100 of deposits from 12 cents per $100.Yesterday, the agency approved that regulation, proposed onemonth ago; the increase will take effect in January.   The FDIC loss projection was based on worse-than-expectedfinancial results for the first half of the year for thebanking industry and the fund. While the FDIC originallypredicted a fund loss of $2 billion for the entire year, itreported yesterday that the fund posted losses of $1.8billion in the first half alone. In all of 1989, its lossestotalled $851 million.   If the insurance fund falls by the $3 billion nowprojected, the fund will close the year at about $10 billion,compared with $18 billion only two years ago. The fund willdrop to a level equal to just 0.5% of insured deposits, itsthinnest margin ever.   The new projection assumes the failure of 35 unidentifiedbanks and savings banks that were cited by the GeneralAccounting Office in its recent assessment of the bank fund,according to FDIC Chairman William Seidman. The FDICpreviously had assumed that some of these institutions wouldcollapse, and in fact, 15 already have been closed. All ofthe institutions have, or had, more than $100 million inassets.   Failure of all 35 of the institutions could add $2 billionin net cost to the fund. Reserving for those possiblefailures is the most conservative course to follow, Mr.Seidman said, but it's too soon to know what final losseswill be. &quot;The estimate we made may well be wrong again,&quot; hewarned. &quot;It may even be too high.&quot;   Indeed, most analysts remain relatively sanguine about thefund, even if they are more pessimistic about the industry.&quot;As far as insuring the broad base of the country's banks,the numbers still work,&quot; said Alex Sheshunoff, who closelytracks financial industry data for Sheshunoff InformationServices Inc., in San Antonio, Texas.   The House has passed legislation that would give the FDICauthority to raise insurance premiums as necessary. TheSenate may take up a version of the bill today. Mr. Seidmansaid yesterday that the FDIC would consider increasingassessments again if Congress grants the authority. &quot;But Idon't think we can fix the fund solely by raising premiums,&quot;he added.   Various congressional committees continue to hold hearingson a variety of proposals to restructure the banking system,but no action is likely until after Jan. 1, when the Bushadministration is expected to unveil a proposal of its own.   With the savings and loan disaster fresh in mind, everypending proposal calls for closer supervision of banks andthrifts, early intervention by regulators -- possibly in theform of restricting dividends -- if bank capital slips, andcontrols to discourage financial institutions away fromtaking large risks with insured deposits. In addition, thereare proposals to reduce insurance coverage for pension fundsand other big depositors.   But regulators worry that Congress will push throughproposals that would inject new instability into thealready-rattled industry. &quot;The last thing we need arepolitical or private interests masquerading as publicpolicy,&quot; warned Robert Clarke, comptroller of the currency.</TEXT></DOC>
