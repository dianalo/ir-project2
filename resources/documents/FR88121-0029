Certain vehicles areexcluded by section S3 from the standard's applicability because they haveunusual physical or operational characteristics that result in restrictedhighway operation (e.g., low speed, permit requirements, daytime operation)which limits hazards and the possibility of accidents. Also, the unusualconfigurations and low production volumes of these vehicles sharply increasecompliance costs.Corpac Industries, Inc., submitted a petition for rulemaking requestingthe elimination of Standard No. 121's exclusion of vehicles that have anoverall vehicle width of more than 102 inches. The petitioner stated thatthe Surface Transportation Act of 1982 prevents states from establishinga maximum width of more than or less than 102 inches for commercial motorvehicles operating on the National Network and that this was subsequentlymodified to include the approximate metric equivalent of 2.6 m or 102.36inches. Corpac submitted information showing that thousands of trailersare now being produced which are 102.36 inches wide. The petitioner arguedthat Standard No. 121 does not technically apply to these vehicles andurged that the 102-inch exclusion be eliminated to prevent the productionof vehicles with possibly markedly inferior braking performance. The first issue raised by Corpac's petition is whether the 102.36-inchtrailers now being produced are excluded from Standard No. 121 by virtueof the provision, set forth in section S3(a), that excludes vehicles thathave ``an overall vehicle width of more than 102 inches with extendableequipment in the fully retracted position.'' As discussed below, it isNHTSA's opinion that these vehicles are <T3>not </T3>excluded, although it agrees that the standard's applicationto the 102.36-inch wide trailers should be clarified. Section 416(a) of the Surface Transportation assistance Act of 1982 statesthat ``(n)o state, other than the State of Hawaii, shall establish, maintain,or enforce any regulation of commerce which imposes a width limitationof <T3>more or less than 102 inches </T3>on any segment of the National Systemof Interstate and Defense Highways, or any other qualifying Federal-aidhighway as designated by the Secretary of Transportation, with trafficlanes designed to be a width of twelve feet or more * * * .'' (Emphasisadded.) In proposing regulations under the statute, the Federal Highway Administration(FHWA) stated the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">The American National Metric Council and the Truck Trailer Manufacturer'sAssociation have called attention to the practices of some Canadian trailermanufacturers to construct their trailers 2.6 meters wide. This dimensionis equivalent to 102.36 inches. The FHWA is interested in knowing the advantagesand disadvantages of allowing trailers of 102.36-inch widths on the roadsas perceived by the State and the public, in general. The FHWA solicitscomments on the question of allowing 102.36-inch wide trailers on the NationalNetwork. 48 FR 41280, September 14, 1983.</ITAG>In issuing a final rule, the FHWA stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Commenters on the subject of recognizing the approximate metric widthequivalent of 2.6 meters (102.36 inches), on trailers were strongly infavor of such a position. Standardization of truck width on an internationalbasis is seen as an important objective, which will serve to enhance internationaltrade. The FHWA concurs in that assessment. The final rule as containedin Section 658.15 establishes the maximum width as 102 inches or its approximatemetric equivalent of 2.6 meters. The FHWA believes the States can accommodatethe rule without changing laws or violating congressional intent. 49 FR23312, June 5, 1984.</ITAG>The FHWA regulation, set forth at 23 CFR 658.15, states:<ITAG tagnum="21">No State shall impose a width limitation of more or less than 102inches, or its approximate metric equivalent, 2.6 meters (102.36 inches)on a vehicle operating on the National Network, except for the State ofHawaii * * * .</ITAG>Thus, 102.36 inches is defined in the FHWA regulation as the ``approximatemetric equivalent'' of 102 inches, and was determined by FHWA as beingconsistent with congressional intent as not being ``more or less'' than102 inches. Particularly given this background, it is NHTSA's opinion thatthe 102.36-inch trailers being produced in light of the FHWA regulationare not considered to have a width of ``more than 102 inches'' within themeaning of Standard No. 121's applicability section. The agency also notesthat previous <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices make it clear that NHTSA did not intendthe criteria in section S3 to exclude typical configuration vehicles fromStandard No. 121. For example, in establishing the 102-inch width exclusion,the agency stated that, in all states other than Hawaii, vehicles exceedingthis width were allowed to operate on the highway only by permit. See 42FR 42208, August 22, 1977.While it is NHTSA's opinion that the 102.36-inch vehicles are not excludedfrom Standard No. 121, it agrees that the applicability of the standardto those vehicles should be clarified.While clarifying the standard's applicability could be achieved throughamending S3(a) to expressly refer to the 102.36-inch trailers, the agencybelieves that a better approach would be to eliminate the exclusion altogether.The agency has tentatively concluded that it is not necessary to retainthe width exclusion. NHTSA is unaware of any vehicles wider than 102 inchesor 102.36 inches that do not come within one of section S3's other exclusions.The agency believes that those exclusions are sufficiently comprehensiveto continue to exclude all vehicles whose function or construction resultin restricted highway operation and for which compliance would be verydifficult.Accordingly, NHTSA is proposing to delete section S3's width exclusion.The agency specifically requests comments on whether any vehicles widerthan 102 inches (or 102.36 inches) are being produced that do not comewithin one of the standard's other exclusions and on whether there areany other reasons to maintain a width exclusion. If any commenters favormaintaining a width exclusion, the agency requests comments on the appropriatewidth (e.g., more than 102.36 inches, 103 inches, etc.) and an explanationof the need for that particular width.The proposed effective date is 30 days after publication of a final rulein the<T4> Federal Register</T4>. NHTSA believes there is a good cause for aneffective date within that time period since the proposed amendment wouldclarify the standard's applicability.The agency has analyzed this proposal and determined that it is neither``major'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 nor ``significant''within the meaning of the Department of Transportation's regulatory policiesand procedures. As indicated above, the proposed amendment would clarifyStandard No. 121's applicability to vehicles of 102.36 inches and is notbelieved to affect the applicability of the standard to any other vehicles.The agency has also determined that the effects of the proposal are sominimal that a full regulatory evaluation is not required.In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluatedthe effects of this action on small entities. I certify that the proposedamendments would not have a significant economic impact on substantialnumber of small entities. For the reasons stated above, the proposed amendmentwould clarify Standard No. 121's applicability to vehicles 102.36 incheswide and is not believed to affect the applicability of the standard toany other vehicles. Thus, neither small businesses, small organizations,nor small governmental units would be affected by the proposed amendment.Finally, the agency has considered the environmental implications of thisproposed rule in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969 and determined that the proposed rule would not have any significantimpact on the human environment.Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It isrequested but not required that 10 copies be submitted.All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessaryattachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detailtheir primary arguments in a concise fashion.If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality,three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidentialbusiness information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA,at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedlyconfidential information has been deleted should be sutmitted to the DocketSection. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a coverletter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidentialbusiness information regulation. 49 CFR Part 512.All comments received before the close of business on the comment closingdate indicated above for the proposal will be considered, and will be availablefor examination in the docket at the above address both before and afterthat date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing datewill also be considered. Comments received too late for consideration inregard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for furtherrulemaking action. Comments on the proposal will be available for inspectionin the docket. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information asit becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommendedthat interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material.Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments inthe rules docket should enclose a self-addressed, stamped postcard in theenvelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisorwill return the postcard by mail.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571</ITAG>Imports, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles, Rubber and rubber products,Tires.In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 571 would be amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 571_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
