These officials say the inhibiting effect of the dollar's drop could become a critical problem for the Fed if, as some analysts expect, the economy begins to show new signs of weakness in the near future.    The announcement yesterday that the West German Bundesbank cut two key interest rates rekindled speculation that the Fed would join in a coordinated rate-cut with other central banks. But one Fed official said that the dollar's sharp decline in recent days &quot;preempted us from being a party&quot; to such an action.    Lower interest rates in the U.S. tend to weaken the dollar by making dollar-denominated investments less attractive relative to other investments. Another official, referring to the dollar's recent decline, concluded, &quot;This is not an opportune time&quot; for a U.S. rate cut because it could exacerbate the dollar's fall, possibly precipitating an uncontrollable slide.    Some officials said the Fed probably wouldn't be easing credit much now anyway because a recent spate of statistics -- including figures on employment and industrial production -- suggest that the economy has begun to pick up strength. But they noted that a number of forecasters are predicting sluggish growth for the first few months of 1987. If the dollar remains weak, they warned, it may undermine the Fed's ability to adopt a stimulative policy.    Fed chairman Paul Volcker strongly indicated on Wednesday that he shares that worry. Speaking at a conference of the Bretton Woods Committee, Mr. Volcker said: &quot;Declining currencies do not provide for extra flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy.&quot;    Other Fed officials, speaking privately, were more blunt. Before frenzied selling of the dollar set in this week, &quot;We had the flexibility to (cut rates) without creating financial difficulties if the economy showed signs of weakening,&quot; said one. &quot;I'm not saying we still wouldn't. But it (the skidding dollar) makes the decision a lot more difficult than it was.&quot;    &quot;The thing Fed officials have nightmares about,&quot; this official continued, &quot;is having to defend the dollar (by allowing U.S. interest rates to rise) when the economy is weak.&quot;    The prospect that the dollar would continue declining even as the economy falters would present the Fed with an agonizing choice: it could either permit a recession, or fight one by easing credit at the risk of causing a disastrous run on the U.S. currency.    To varying degrees, Fed officials -- like many in the Reagan administration and Congress -- welcome the dollar's decline as helpful in making U.S. goods more competitive on world markets.    The recent turmoil in currency markets, officials add, may also help prod West Germany and Japan to adopt measures to stimulate their economies, thereby boosting demand for U.S.-made products. The strength of the mark and the yen is hurting West German and Japanese exports, and U.S. policy makers are hoping that the pain will prompt the allies to rely less on exports and more on &quot;home-grown&quot; demand for economic growth.    But Fed officials tend to worry more than their Reagan administration counterparts about the possibility of a precipitous drop in the dollar. Such an event could trigger a panicky withdrawal of foreign capital from the U.S., pushing up interest rates and threatening financial collapse.    Fed officials doubt that the Bundesbank's action will stimulate the West German economy or help stabilize the dollar. The Bundesbank announced cuts in two widely publicized lending rates, but said it would tighten its grip on credit in other ways.    &quot;It's really sort of a sterilized effect,&quot; lamented one Fed source, noting that the currency markets yesterday morning regarded the West German action as a reason to buy marks and sell dollars rather than the other way around.    &quot;This leaves us in the same position we were in before,&quot; the official said. &quot;It would improve our flexibility if the dollar had strengthened after this German (interest-rate) cut, but it hasn't. We're in a tougher box now if the economy shows some sign of weakness.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
