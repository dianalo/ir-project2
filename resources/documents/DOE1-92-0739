The counter consists of an outer cylindrical pipe with an innerdiameter of 40 mm, seven resistive stainless steel anode wires with adiameter of 22{mu}m, and 24 cathode wires with a diameter of 120{mu}m.These wires divide the radial cross section of the pipe into seven regions.Since each region independently works as a position sensitive proportionalcounter and the seven resistive anode wires are connected in series throughlump resistors, the region and the axial position where a {beta}-decayevent ocurred can be known by a simple operation upon the charge signalsobtained from two preamplifiers. The axial position resolution for /sup3/H {beta}-rays was 9 mm FWHM. Demonstrative experiments were performedfor the flow and diffusion of /sup 3/H labeled ethane in the counterpipe.</TEXT></DOC>
