In a big block trade that wasn't recorded on the New YorkStock Exchange yesterday, several traders said the SalomonInc. unit sold seven million shares of ConAgra, an Omaha,Neb., food concern, at $43 a share after the market closed.</LP><TEXT>   A Salomon spokesman wouldn't comment. Traders estimatedthat Salomon's losses might have been as little as $10million, or even less if the firm was able to hedge itsposition with options or other mechanisms.   KKR, the New York leveraged buy-out concern, sold 10.9million ConAgra shares on Sept. 26 in an underwriting bySalomon alone at $46.25 a share, or a total price tag of $505million. The sale represented about 7% of ConAgra's shares,fully diluted.   At the time, some Salomon clients said the firm appearedeager to win such underwriting assignments in order to showthat its stock trading desk remained strong despite thescandal surrounding its government bond operation.   However, the KKR sale occurred the same day as ConAgra'sstock hit an intraday peak of $47.625 after the companyannounced a 3-for-2 stock split and a dividend increasepayable Dec. 2 to holders of record Nov. 8.   The stock traded at or above $46 a share for six moretrading days, only to tumble by $2.25 a share yesterday toclose at $43 in composite trading on the New York StockExchange. Traders said the price collapsed after Salomoninformed clients it planned to unload its unsold shares afterthe close at $43.   Traders said it appeared that the best Salomon could havedone in the situation was to have found buyers for 3.9million shares at $46.25 when KKR sold. They estimated thatSalomon's cost for the shares, counting commissions andselling concessions, might have been as little as $45 each.   The same traders said it appeared that the seven millionshares sold yesterday represented the leftover portion of theSept. 26 underwriting. If so, that would indicate Salomonincurred losses of roughly $15.8 million on those shares,offset by an indicated profit of as much as $4.9 million onthe 3.9 million shares sold for $46.25.   A ConAgra spokesman reached last night wouldn't comment onthe pricing of the Salomon block but said the company &quot;hadvisited with the New York Stock Exchange about the activityin the stock.&quot; While the price drop was &quot;unsettling,&quot; hesaid, he was sure it &quot;had nothing to do with ourfundamentals.&quot;   Traders said they didn't believe that Salomon was forcedto dump the ConAgra stock out of any pressing financial need,mainly because the firm bought the stock long after thegovernment bond trading scandal became public. However, theoutcome could be another blow to the firm's efforts to shoreup its reputation.   It wasn't immediately apparent why Salomon didn't executethe trade on the Big Board. Traders speculated it could havebeen because off-Board trading rules are less stringent insome circumstances. Or it may simply have been an effort toreduce the amount of attention the trade received.</TEXT></DOC>
