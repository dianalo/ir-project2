Negotiator Richard Burt declined to discuss Bush's proposals indetail, but said ``we have noticed that the Soviets have taken amuch more open and constructive approach on verification in recentyears.''   Bush's proposal came Monday in Washington as the superpowersresumed Strategic Arms Reduction Talks in Geneva after a seven-monthrecess.   The president said the United States and Soviet Union shouldbegin testing verification procedures during negotiations onreducing long-range nuclear forces, rather than waiting until a pactis completed.   Such steps could involve trial inspections at each other'smissile sites and discussions about equipment needed forverification, which Bush said could be the most complex issue facingnegotiators.   Tuesday's editions of The Washington Post quoted an unidentifiedofficial in Washington as saying negotiators plan to suggestaround-the-clock monitoring of some ballistic missile factories andon-site checks of missile warheads, to start before any newagreement. The proposal also was reported to include a ban on somemissile flight tests.   Burt said that another aim of Bush's plan is to build support forSenate ratification of a future arms treaty.   Several superpower arms control treaties, including the 1979 SALTII pact on limiting long-range nuclear arsenals, remained unratifiedbecause the Senate decided the verification provisions were lax.   Burt said progress on verification would not become a conditionin the START talks.   ``We will continue to move on all fronts,'' he said. ``We are notproposing these measures as a take-it-or-leave-it package.''   The talks, aimed at reducing U.S. and Soviet long-range bombers,missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent, are thelatest round in negotiations that began four years ago.   Burt said at the news conference that their aim is to ``speedresolution of outstanding issues and give added momentum'' towardcompleting a treaty.   Under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's philosophy of moreopenness, Moscow has allowed Western experts to tour a Sovietchemical weapons site for the first time as part of efforts tonegotiate a global ban.   U.S. and Soviet scientists also have exchanged visits to eachother's nuclear testing sites to examine ways of monitoring two1970s treaties limiting atomic blasts that the Senate never approved.   Burt confirmed that the Bush administration's review of armspolicy did not result in a change in the Strategic DefenseInitiative, which calls for space-based missile defenses, a divisiveissue since arms talks began.   He rejected Soviet attempts to link a START treaty to agreementon what Washington says would be crippling curbs on SDI.   On Monday, Yuri Nazarkin, head of the Soviet delegation to thetalks, met with Burt for 80 minutes at the U.S. Mission.   Nazarkin spoke of ``a good start'' and held out the prospect ofunspecified Soviet initiatives.   The talks are to last six to seven weeks.   In detailed negotiations starting Wednesday with a full meetingof both delegations, Burt will lead the U.S. team and Lem Masterkovwill continue as Soviet negotiator under Nazarkin.   Disputes have developed over Moscow's demand for includingsea-based cruise missiles in the treaty and Washington's call for aban on mobile missiles.   At earlier talks boths sides agreed to lower ceilings of 6,000nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _ missiles and bombers_ for each side.</TEXT></DOC>
