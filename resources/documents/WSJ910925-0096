One Brussels antitrust lawyer notedthat the agreement &quot;presents a solid antitrust front againstJapan.&quot;   This and similar comments are puzzling because it is notentirely clear what antitrust purpose is served by a &quot;solidfront&quot; against Japan. It is suggested that the U.S. andEurope now could jointly press the Japanese to removerestraints on competition in Japan, thereby making it easierfor Western firms to do business there. But that would mainlybenefit Japanese consumers rather than the half-billioncitizens who shop in the markets of Europe and the U.S. We'vealways assumed that antitrust policy -- aside fromdisciplining producers and thereby making them more efficient-- was designed to protect consumers.</LP><TEXT>   No one need doubt the free-market allegiances of Monday'ssigners, EC Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan andacting U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr. But while whatthey signed was hailed in the press releases as an &quot;historic&quot;document, in truth its aims and possibilities are modestrelative to the problems antitrust policy should address,especially in Europe.   The point of antitrust law, it hardly needs saying, is toenforce competition. Adam Smith and all fellow freemarketeers before and after him had no doubt that suchenforcement was a proper role for the state. But that simpleformulation left two things unsaid that are not agreed uponto this day: How much state intervention is needed and whoprotects the consumer against the anti-competitive policiesof the state itself?   Federal intervention in the U.S. has followed cycles. Inthe 1970s, antitrust enforcement was highly intrusive and nota little bit silly in some of its theoretical concepts ofwhat constituted monopolistic behavior. In the 1980s, policymostly reverted back to a simple precept: Price fixing isdefinitely restraint of trade and that is the one to watch.Now, some would-be enforcers in Washington are trying toenlarge the hunting ground again.   As to the EC, Europe-wide enforcement is relatively new.And it is here that the question of who protects the consumerfrom the anti-competitive practices of the state representsthe biggest problem.   European taxpayers pay huge subsidies to state-ownedindustries and they pay again in the form of higher pricesbrought about by protections for both state and privateindustries. If a so-called &quot;voluntary restraint agreement&quot;just signed with Japan by the EC is any guide, Europeansstill will be paying heavily to protect the likes of France'sRenault and Italy's Fiat well into the 21st century. U.S.auto makers, particularly GM and Ford, don't complain becausetheir own operations in Europe benefit from the protectiveumbrella. EC competition law does little to addressanticompetitive practices in the auto trade. Meanwhile in theU.S., old-line steel producers are agitating again forrestraints on imported steel.   Leon Brittan has tackled anti-competitive practices inEurope's airline industry, also dominated by state companies.But mostly it has been a losing battle. Reciprocal agreementssheltering state airlines on certain routes still keep airfares for similar distances in Europe far above those in theU.S. As to that most clear-cut form of private restraint oftrade, collusive price fixing, the EC does not yet haveadequate tools to enforce the existing ban on that practice.   In truth, what the U.S. and EC signed was not an agreementto cooperate on &quot;antitrust&quot; policy, but a deal to cooperateon mergers and acquisitions policy, which is not the samething. They will try to avoid stepping on each other's toeswhen multinational corporations are wheeling and dealing.U.S. merger law again understands that big is not necessarilybad, and that government barriers to entry in markets are agreater danger than the market share any particular firmhappens to control. It would be a pity for this lesson to belost on Europe.   If approached in a way that does not interfere withlegitimate and sensible efforts by business to strengthentheir competitive positions, some cooperation might proveuseful. But as to protecting consumers on either side of theAtlantic from the most costly forms of restraint of trade --those decreed by government itself -- this deal does nothing.A &quot;solid front&quot; against Japan may sound good tounreconstructed fans of the corporate state, but that is notantitrust policy. If what is really meant is keeping Japanout of markets, it is anti-antitrust.</TEXT></DOC>
