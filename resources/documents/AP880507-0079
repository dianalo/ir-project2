The two-day ``Operation Law and Order'' signaled a new Israeliwillingness to get involved in Lebanon despite the national traumasuffered by a three-year occupation of Lebanon that cost nearly 700lives and deeply divided the Jewish state.   As in Israel's 1982 invasion, the incursion triggered a debateon the defense minister's failure to notify the Cabinet of hisplans to launch a large-scale military action near Syrian armylines.   It also risked reprisals against foreign hostages held bypro-Iranian groups in Lebanon although comment on this issue wasmuted in Israel.   In a two-pronged thrust, a force of about 1,500 Israeli soldiersand allied South Lebanon Army militiamen pushed beyond the six- to10-mile border security zone for the first time since February 1986.   They came up empty-handed in a sweep of Sunni Moslem villagesnear the western slopes of Mount Hermon, limiting their action todistributing leaflets warning residents not to cooperate withPalestinian guerrillas.   A second column of Israeli tanks and infantry backed up byhelicopter gunships fought a short but fierce gunbattle withHezbollah guerrillas dug into the abandoned village of Maydoun, 12miles north of Israel's border. Israeli officials said 40guerrillas and three Israeli soldiers were killed.   Uri Lubrani, the defense ministry's coordinator for Lebanonpolicy, said the army was prodded into action by 12 Palestinianguerrilla raids that disrupted life in northern Israel and cost thelives of 11 Israeli soldiers since November.   He and other Israeli officials suggested that if such raidsfailed to keep the border safe, Israel might have to adopt the``dreadful option'' of invading Lebanon as it did in 1982.   ``Whatever we are doing along the border, and this operation wasjust one facet of a whole mesh of activities, is all designed toone purpose: to avoid the possibility that we will have to moveinto Lebanon in force, with divisions and stay there,'' Lubranisaid in an interview.   The search-and-destroy mission came within a few miles of Syrianarmy lines in Lebanon, raising fears of a confrontation with theSoviet-backed government in Damascus.   The liberal daily Haaretz suggested Rabin changed targets inmidcourse and attacked a Hezbollah base near Syrian lines afterfailing to find Palestinian guerrillas in villages near MountHermon.   ``There is reason to ask whether it was necessary to take such arisk by increasing the penetration range to the point of proximityto the Syrian military positions in order to prove that theincursion was not launched in vain,'' said Haaretz.   Defense ministry officials insisted the Hezbollah base atMaydoun was targeted from the onset.   ``We are facing Syrian influenced areas from which terroristactivity against Israel is being initiated. Therefore the Syriansmust know that something is bound to happen if this continues,''said Lubrani.   Rabin was also attacked for failing to notify the 25-memberIsraeli Cabinet of his plans to launch a major operation in southLebanon that risked confrontation with Syria.   Abba Eban, chairman of parliament's Foreign Affairs and DefenseCommittee, rejected Rabin's explanation that the operation wasroutine and did not need government approval.   ``Such an operation, on such a scale and with the possibility ofentangling results because of the closeness to the Syrians, I don'tthink it may be called routine,'' he said on Israel TV.   Among those Israel radio reported to be critical of Rabin'sfailure to notify the Cabinet was former Defense Minister ArielSharon, who was himself attacked for failing to keep the governmentinformed about his 1982 invaision.   Rabin said actions to protect the northern border did notrequire advance Cabinet approval, and his spokesman Eitan Habernoted Rabin informed Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. But Shamir wasquoted by the daily Maariv newspaper as saying he was not aware itwould be ``on such a wide scale.''   The operation also broke a previous reluctance, reportedly basedon a U.S. government request for restraint, not to attack ShiiteMoslem guerrillas in Lebanon for fear of endangering U.S. and otherforeign hostages, including two Israeli soldiers captured byHezbollah guerrillas in February 1986.   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, armed forces chief of staff, was quoted inan interview with the daily Yediot Ahronot newspaper as sayingIsrael had been avoiding certain areas but said there had been noAmerican ``veto'' on such attacks.   ``There never was a general veto. There were certain placesregarding which we didn't know if there were prisoners or not, andtherefore we had to be careful,'' Shomron said.   Critics also said the pro-Iraninan Hezbollah, or Party of God,would quickly rebuild destroyed bases, and might attack Israelproper instead of limiting its actions to south Lebanon.   ``Why Hezbollah?'' Uzi Mahanaimi asked in a front-pagecommentary in the mass circulation Yediot Ahronot daily.``Hezbollah is not the Israeli army's main enemy in south Lebanonand hasn't tried to penetrate into northern Israel.''   Other analysts suggested it was futile to try to wipe outguerrilla bases because they would only reappear elsewhere. Theyargued such military action only threatened to escalate violenceand drag Israel's army back into Lebanon.   Yossi Olmert, a Middle East expert at Tel Aviv University,predicted a ``long hot summer'' on the northern border.   ``There is no doubt that the Hezbollah absorbed a heavy blow,but it was not a death blow,'' said Olmert. ``This battle may givethem additional motivation. We can expect them to enlarge theiroperations.''</TEXT></DOC>
