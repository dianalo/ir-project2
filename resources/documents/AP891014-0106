Unlike his action following the record 508-point drop in thestock market on Black Monday two years ago, Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan did not issue a statement pledging that thecentral bank stands ready to supply needed bank reserves to cushionthe new shock to the financial system.   A Fed official, speaking on condition that his name not be used,said such a statement was not necessary.   He said reports coming in from commercial banks indicated thatnone of them is facing a credit squeeze as a result of the Fridaymarket plunge, which wiped out nearly $200 billion in stock values.   Greenspan's decisive action to supply plentiful credit to thebanking system two years ago won widespread praise at the time as akey factor in keeping the market turmoil from sending the entireeconomy into a tailspin.   ``The contingency plan (drawn up by Greenspan) still exists, butthere has been no need to put it into effect,'' a Fed official saidSaturday.   Officials said no thought is being given to canceling ascheduled speech by Greenspan to the American Bankers' Associationon Monday. In 1987, Greenspan did cancel his planned address beforethe ABA convention in Dallas to fly back to Washington to takecharge of monitoring market developments.   For its part, the Bush administration sought to dismiss anyefforts to compare Friday's 190-point plunge to the 1987 crash.   ``No one looks at this as anything at all like October 1987,''said a Treasury official, speaking on condition of anonymity.   President Bush spent the wekend at Camp David, Md., and theWhite House issued no statements on his behalf.   Aides to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said he had discussedFriday's developments with Greenspan and Richard Breeden, who wassworn in three days ago as the new chairman of the Securities andExchange Commission.   Brady, who also was in touch with officials at the New YorkStock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said in astatement late Friday that the stock decline ``doesn't signal anyfundamental change in the condition of the economy'' with theprospects still favorable for continued expansion.   Private economists tended to agree with this assessment, sayingthere are a variety of differences between 1989 and 1987.   In the 1987 crash, interest rates were shooting upward and thedollar was extremely weak, two factors that added to investoruncertainty. This time, interest rates have been steady and thedollar has been showing surprising strength.   ``In 1987, we had an all-out panic,'' said David Jones, aneconomist with Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., a government securitiesdealer. ``This has been a collapse confined primarily toleveraged-buyout activity which had been driving the market upwardthis year.''   Still, analysts said that Monday could be a rough day in themarkets, especially if Friday's weakness in New York spills overinto the Tokyo stock exchange when it opens late Sunday night.   In 1987, a 109-point drop on Friday, Oct. 16, triggered sellingon foreign exchanges which then contributed to the 508-point plungeon Monday.   Michael Evans, a Washington economist who had predicted in hismost recent news letter that the stock market was on the verge of abig sell-off, said Saturday he expects the market to drop anadditional 300 points.   But Evans said even with this pessimistic outlook, he did notexpect the U.S. economy to be pushed into a recession.   ``This doesn't tell us anything about the real economy. It tellsus that there has been a squeeze on corporate profits this year,''he said.   Many economists said they expected the Fed would begin pushinginterest rates lower in coming weeks, but that it will be verygradual to avoid the appearance that the central bank was bowing topolitical pressure from the administration, which has been pushingfor lower rates for some time.   Jones said he was looking for the bellwether federal funds rate,the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, to fallto 8 percent from the current 9 percent over the next two months.He said he was also looking for a cut in the Fed's discount rate inthat time period.   Many of the country's top corporate executives, at a meeting ofthe Business Council in Hot Springs, Va., also expressed confidencethat Friday's market turmoil will have no significant impact on theeconomy, which they said will slow next year but then rebound withfaster growth in 1991.   A.W. Clausen, head of Bank of America, said the fact thatGreenspan led the country through the 1987 crash gave himconfidence government officials will know how to handle the currentturmoil.   ``Allan Greenspan is a seasoned veteran. He managed our waythrough the last time and I have utmost confidence in hisabilities,'' he said.   But not all executives were as sanguine about the market'simmediate prospects.   Rand V. Araskog, chairman of ITT Corp., blamed a lack ofgovernment controls on corporate takeovers for the speculativefever which drove stock prices to unjustified highs.   ``A lot of people are saying, `No problem. This isn't 1987.' Butwho knows,'' he told reporters. ``If the Tokyo and London marketsstay stable, then it could stay stable here. But if they don't,then we could have a rough time on Monday.''</TEXT></DOC>
