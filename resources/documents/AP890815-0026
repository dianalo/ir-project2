However, Fitzwater said he would not equate progress on thediplomatic front with the eventual release of the hostages.   ``Those two elements are a long way apart, so I would not comparethe two,'' he said.   Fitzwater said the United States had gleaned ``considerableamounts of information'' from contacts with other countries. Askedif information was being received from Iran, he replied, ``from allsources.''   The United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iranbut has been communicating through third-party contacts, such as theSwiss government.   Asked what he meant by ``significant'' progress, Fitzwater said,``We're not prepared to say, but (it is) in the general issue ofunderstanding the problem better, improving relations and hopefullyto get some kind of break down the road.   ``I think we're looking at a long-term situation, months, notweeks.''   Fitzwater declined comment on a statement by Iran's spiritualleader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that Iran will never hold talks withthe United States. Shortly before Khamenei made his statement, Iranrenewed an offer to help free the hostages.   Fitzwater said the contradictory statements ``typifies why wewould not like to react to every comment that is made.''</TEXT></DOC>
