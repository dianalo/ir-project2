Pascal Zachary   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/16/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><CO>   SUNW</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)</IN><LP>   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc. introduceda computer workstation priced at $4,995, setting a newstandard for high-powered desktop computing at relatively lowprices.   Sun's new computer, called the Sparcstation SLC, is likelyto cement Sun's lead in the workstation market, one of thefastest-growing segments of the computer industry. WhileSun's chief competitors in workstations, Hewlett-Packard Inc.and Digital Equipment Corp., vow to introduce similarlypriced but more powerful workstations, some analysts thinkSun's new machine will confound competitors for many months.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This makes it difficult for DEC and HP to keep up withSun in the workstation business,&quot; said Vicki Brown, ananalysts at International Data Corp.   Sun declined to estimate future sales of the machine,though it said it had already received orders for 5,000units.   However, Ms. Brown said Sun's newest computer is expectedto lift sales of its year-old Sparcstation familysignificantly. She said sales of all three models, includingthe SLC, will probably total 95,000 units this year, roughlythree times last year's sales.   Besides helping Sun satisfy its traditional engineeringand scientific customers, the new machine will add momentumto the company's assault on the market for personalcomputers, generally used by white collar workers.   &quot;The battle today is on the desktop,&quot; said Scott McNealy,Sun's chief executive officer, referring to the company'splans to butt heads with such PC makers as Apple ComputerInc.   While Sun may steal some PC sales, the new SLC lacks ahard-disk drive, the basic storage device for PCs, and itcan't be upgraded with accessories that improve performance.   But the machine operates at blazing speeds -- 12.5 millionoperations a second -- because it has at its heart Sun's ownSparc microprocessor. The extra speed is useful in, forinstance, financial modeling or electronic publishing, wherePCs often lack the horsepower to carry out complex tasks.   Sun is expected to introduce an even faster Sparcstationbefore the end of the year, putting further pressure oncompetitors. That machine might even share the same packagingas the SLC, which is designed so that its circuitry sharesthe same housing as its 17-inch monitor.   The packaging is crucial to Sun's profit margins on thecomputer, which may sell for as little as $3,000 whenpurchased in large quantities. Ms. Brown said Sun spent $1million on tooling for the computer and managed to design themachine without a fan, which reduces the computer's noise andmanufacturing costs.   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun sharesclosed at $29.25 apiece, down $1.25 on heavy volume of about1.9 million shares.</TEXT></DOC>
