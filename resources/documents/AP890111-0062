About 50,000 demonstrators took to the streets again today inTitograd, the regional capital, Belgrade radio said. Police ringedthe republic's Parliament building to block the jostling, chantingcrowd, the radio said.   Many of the 60,000 people who massed outside Parliament onTuesday chanted slogans such as ``Down With Armchair Leaders,''``Down with Scoundrels,'' and ``We Want Free Elections.'' Thedemonstrators demanded their leaders step down because of theirfailure to reverse the republic's economic woes.   In the republic of Slovenia today, a group of citizens announcedthe establishment of the Slovenian Democratic Union, the firstindependent political group to be set up in Yugoslavia. The Unionwill strive for parliamentary democracy, free elections and the``open competition of ideas,'' said Dimitrij Rupel, a prominentauthor and the group's founder.   The latest demonstrations in Montenegro follow the resignation ofthe republic's government _ but not party leaders _ in Octoberduring similar protests. Police broke up those protests, and partyleaders refused to resign.   The political turmoil in Montenegro also follows nationwideprotests during much of last year that toppled some regional andnational leaders.   The government of Premier Branko Mukulic resigned Dec. 20 over250 percent annual inflation and other economic problems. It was thefirst time the government of Yugoslavia had stepped down since thecommunists took power here after World War II.   The state news agency Tanjug said Montenegro's Communist PartyCentral Committee, its policy-making body, would meet tonight toconsider the offer of resignation from party leaders and thecollectively-held state presidency. The republic's Parliament willconvene Saturday to consider the state presidency's resignation fromthe largely ceremonial post, Tanjug said.   Montenegro is one of the poorest of Yugoslavia's six republics,with an unemployment rate of 25 percent. The republic has been hithard by a recent spate of closures of unprofitable firms that put10,000 people out of work.   The new Slovenian Democratic Union was to hold its constituentassembly in Ljubljana later today, and Jan. 11, 1989, will beconsidered as the date of its formal constitution, activists said.   The Slovenian Democratic Union will nominate its members forParliament and other leading functions in the republic.   ``The Union's first task will be the writing of Slovenia's newconstitution,'' which will be much more democratic and would, unlikethe current one, envisage multi-party democracy, Rupel said.   The Slovenian Democratic Union is only the first of severalpolitical associations that have announced their plans to beformally constituted in the liberal republic of Slovenia, the regionwidely considered as the most democratic in communist-ruled EasternEurope.   The emergence of independent parties comes at a time whenYugoslavia is in the throes of its deepest political and economiccrisis in history, which includes Europe's highest inflation ofabout 250 percent a year, large-scale unemployment and increasinglabor and social unrest.</TEXT></DOC>
