In the little-noticed arrest, Inam Ul-Haq was seized byGerman authorities on July 11 at Frankfurt's airport after hearrived carrying a phony passport. The U.S. JusticeDepartment said it is moving to extradite the general under afour-year-old indictment on charges that he orchestrated aplot to evade U.S. Customs laws in shipping sensitive,strategic materials. Documents produced in that case showthat units of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A. played a rolein financing the shipment.                                                                                                          In the wake of the arrest, Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio),chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, saidthe BCCI involvement in the case could be a &quot;smoking gun&quot;that would help U.S. investigators unravel the mystery of howPakistan's nuclear program has been financed.   Separately, Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister ofPakistan, said the U.S. warned Pakistan's government ofpossible corruption at BCCI almost three years ago.   In an interview yesterday, Ms. Bhutto, now the leader ofPakistan's leading opposition political party, said that whenshe became prime minister in November 1988, &quot;friends inAmerica had warned us that we should be very careful indealing with BCCI.&quot; She declined to identify who gave thewarnings. Two-thirds of BCCI's loans in Pakistan, which total6.2 billion rupees, ($252 million) were made togovernment-run corporations, bankers in Karachi said.   Ms. Bhutto said she was led to believe BCCI was &quot;close toAmerica.&quot; Specifically, she said, some BCCI associates,including Saudi businessman Gaith Pharaon, were &quot;widelyconsidered&quot; in Islamabad to be well-connected in Washington.Investigators at several levels have alleged that Mr. Pharaonfunctioned as a nominee for BCCI in the U.S., purchasingshares in financial institutions on behalf of BCCI but hidingBCCI's involvement in the transactions.   Sen. Glenn called on the Justice Department to investigatethe possible BCCI role in the Pakistani nuclear program. &quot;Foryears there has been speculation that the Pakistani programwas being bankrolled by persons in the Middle East,&quot; Sen.Glenn noted. &quot;If BCCI was funding, at least in part, thePakistani nuclear weapons program, was this strictly afinancial deal or was there a tie in whereby others could gettheir hands on the technology?&quot;   U.S. and German intelligence reports have identified Mr.Ul-Haq as a buyer for Pakistan's Atomic Energy Commission.&quot;He was the driving force behind the whole thing,&quot; said AmyKurland, an assistant U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia,referring to a 1987 case in which she prosecuted Arshad Z.Pervez, a Canadian businessman. The indictment in the caseasserts that Mr. Ul-Haq directed Mr. Pervez to enter the U.S.to buy a special high-strength steel that requires a U.S.export license.   Documents found by the Canadian police in Mr. Pervez'shouse show that the financial preparations for the proposed$333,450 steel-purchasing deal involved London and Torontobranches of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg).   One link between the two branches was an office of HabibEuropean Bank Ltd. on the Isle of Man, which issued anirrevocable letter of credit in connection with thetransaction. The Isle of Man is a small island betweenIreland and England. The letter of credit details how 50,000pounds of the special alloy-steel bars would be shipped from&quot;U.S.A./Canada to Karachi, Pakistan, by steamer.&quot;   Evidence of BCCI's involvement meant little to U.S.investigators when they received the documents in 1987.Luxembourg, after all, isn't commonly associated withclandestine nuclear development effforts. But the scandalthat has since erupted has made it plain that the bank wastightly held by a group of Pakistanis with close ties to itsgovernment and access to rich Persian Gulf sheiks.   While Mr. Pervez was convicted in December 1987, Mr.Ul-Haq remained beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.Pakistani officials, insisting that neither Mr. Ul-Haq or Mr.Pervez was acting on behalf of Pakistan's government, havetold U.S. investigators that the former general was now aLahore businessman who had &quot;disappeared.&quot;   Investigators hope that Mr. Ul-Haq's arrest may yield moreevidence on how the Pakistani government's nuclear buying andsmuggling operations worked, and whether there are more BCCIties. Much of the operation in the U.S. is believed to havebeen conducted from Pakistan and from Pakistan's embassy inBonn through operatives in Canada using banks in Europe.   Mr. Pervez, who operated from an office in Willowdale,Ontario, was convicted of trying to get around the need for aU.S. export license by offering a bribe to an undercover U.S.Customs agent posing as a U.S. Department of Commercelicensing officer. Mr. Pervez was seeking to ship 50,000pounds of &quot;maraging 350 steel,&quot; a special, very high strengthsteel that is used in high-speed centrifuges.   Such centrifuges are used to extract U235, an explosivemetal used in nuclear weapons, from its close chemicalrelatives. According to the Justice Department's indictment,Mr. Pervez was instructed by Mr. Ul Haq to find a way to&quot;bypass&quot; the Commerce Department and also to shop forberyllium, another nuclear-weapons material.   The Pervez case helped trigger the U.S. decision lastOctober to cut off further aid to Pakistan, which is nowbelieved to have developed nuclear weapons as the result ofits clandestine development program.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
