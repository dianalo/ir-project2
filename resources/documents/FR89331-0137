In March 1988, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) Council of Representatives adopted a panel report finding that Canada'sexport prohibition is inconsistent with Canada's obligations under theGATT.Based on the Council's findings, and because Canada continues to maintainits export prohibition, the USTR has determined under section 304(a)(1)A)of the Act, subject to the direction of the President, that Canada's exportprohibition consultations with the Government of Canada. These consultationswere held on September 3 and October 27, 1986. They failed to yield a satisfactoryresolution of the issue. Consequently, the USTR invoked the formal disputesettlement procedures of the GATT and won a favorable panel decision thatwas adopted by the GATT Council in March 1988. Representatives of the United States and Canada again consulted on March9-11, 1988. On March 22, 1988, the Government of Canada announced thatit would eliminate the export restrictions effective January 1, 1989. TheGovernment of Canada also announced that it intended to impose new requirementsfor landing and inspection of certain species of fish prior to exportation.On August 30, 1988, the USTR invited public comments, pursuant to section304(b)(1)(A), on a proposed USTR determination regarding the Canadian exportprohibition. 53 FR 33207. Canada has not as yet eliminated its export restrictionsnor imposed landing and inspection requirements. <ITAG tagnum="84">Notice of Determinations and Public Hearing</ITAG>On the basis of the findings adopted by the GATT Contracting Parties, andbecause Canada continues to maintain the export prohibition, the USTR determinedon March 28, 1989 that Canada's export prohibition denies a right to whichthe United States is entitled under a trade agreement. The USTR also directedthe denies rights to which the United States is entitled under a tradeagreement. Pending further developments in this case, the USTR has directedthe Section 301 Committee to conduct a public hearing on possible U.S.action under section 301 as a result of this determination. This hearingwill be held on April 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Questions about products underconsideration for increased duties or other import restrictions shouldbe directed to Mr. Jukka Kolhonen, U.S. Department of Commerce, (301) 427-2383.Questions concerning the status of this case, or other questions, shouldbe referred to Mr. Peter Murphy, Assistant United States Trade Representative,Office of the United States Trade Representative (202) 395-4866.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On April 1, 1986, Icicle Seafoods andnine other companies with fish processing facilities in southeastern Alaskaand the State of Washington filed a petition under section 301 of the TradeAct of 1974 alleging that Canada prohibited exports of unprocessed Pacificherring and pink and sockeye salmon, and that this policy was an unjustifiabletrade practice in violation of Article XI of the GATT.
