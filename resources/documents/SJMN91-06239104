I've won a lot of People'sChoice Awards. . . . This isn't payola, but I'd like to buy you all a car.&quot;;  The same old series;   While newcomers dominated the individual awards --except for two-time winner Bebe Neuwirth and three-time winner Patricia Wettig-- it was the same old stuff in the series category.;   &quot;Cheers&quot; won the bestcomedy for the zillionth time, and &quot;L.A. Law&quot; did the same. I guess thevoters, stumped by a category without the Oscars in it, couldn't decidebetween excellent but canceled shows like &quot;China Beach&quot; and &quot;thirtysomething&quot;and new favorites like &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; -- which isn't really a drama atall -- and went for the one they'd voted for before.;   Canceled shows did gettheir due, however, with Busfield and Wettig winning for &quot;thirtysomething,&quot;Jones and Madge Sinclair winning for &quot;Gabriel's Fire,&quot; a show whose title andpremise have been changed for the coming season, and director Thomas Carterfor &quot;Equal Justice,&quot; another victim of the ABC quality drama purge.;   &quot;Pleasedo not slink back into the mundane,&quot; Carter urged the networks, which seem tobe doing just that with their fall schedules. Innovation, he said, &quot;is ouronly salvation.&quot;;   Many celebrities at the telecast were wearing redarmbands. The bands were, explained co-host Jamie Lee Curtis to an applaudingaudience, &quot;to promote support and awareness of the AIDS crisis.&quot;;   Touchingtributes; Close to viewers' hearts were Michael Landon and Danny Thomas, bothof whom were honored on Sunday's show: Landon in a film tribute introduced byMelissa Gilbert-Brinkman and Merlin Olsen, and Thomas by his daughter, Marlo,who introduced the new members of the Television Hall of Fame, including herfather.;   Both tributes were nicely done, although it seemed like cruel andunusual punishment to put the camera on Landon's choked-up family right afterhis was finished.;   We didn't need to see that, although, as usual, whentalking about the Emmys, you could say that for the entire show. If you didn'twatch it, you didn't miss that much.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  David Rosenthal column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910826  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,027  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, August 26, 199100239104,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
