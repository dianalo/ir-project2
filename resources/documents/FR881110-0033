Public comment is requested concerning the FDANotice of Proposed Rulemaking. Comment regarding the Department of Educationdepartures is also solicited.Adoption of the common Federal Policy by these Departments and Agencieswill implement a recommendation of the President's Commission for the Studyof Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Researchwhich was established on November 9, 1978, by Pub. L. 95-622. One of thecharges to the President's Commission was to report biennially to the President,the Congress, and appropriate Federal Departments and Agencies on the protectionof human subjects of biomedical and behavioral research. In carrying outthat charge, the President's Commission was directed to conduct a reviewof the adequacy and uniformity (1) of the rules, policies, guidelines,and regulations of all Federal Departments and Agencies regarding the protectionof human subjects of biomedical or behavioral research which such departmentsand agencies conduct or support, and (2) of the implementation of suchrules, policies, guidelines, and regulations by such agencies, such reviewto include appropriate recommendations for legislation and administrativeaction.In December 1981 the President's Commission issued its <T3>First Biennial Report on the Adequacy and Uniformity of Federal Rulesand Policies, and their Implementation, for the Protection of Human Subjectsin Biomedical and Behavioral Research, Protecting Human Subjects.</T3>In accord with Pub. L. 95-622, each Federal Department or Agency whichreceives recommendations from the President's Commission with respect toits rules, policies, guidelines or regulations, must publish the recommendationsin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and provide an opportunity for interested personsto submit written data, views and arguments with respect to adoption ofthe recommendations. On March 29, 1982 (47 FR 13272-13305), the Secretary,HHS published the recommendation on behalf of the affected Departmentsand Agencies.In May 1982 the Chairman of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science,Engineering, and Technology (FCCSET), appointed an <T3>Ad Hoc</T3> Committee for the Protection of Human Research Subjectsunder the auspices of the FCCSET. The Committee, chaired by Dr. EdwardN. Brandt, Jr., Assistant Secretary for Health, Department of Health andHuman Services (HHS), was composed of the representatives and ex-officiomembers of affected Departments and Agencies. In consultation with theOffice of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Office of Managementand Budget, the <T3>Ad Hoc</T3> Committee, after considering all public comments, developedresponses to the recommendations of the President's Commission. After furtherreview and refinement, OSTP responded on behalf of all the affected Departmentand Agency heads to the recommendations of the President's Commission,including the recommendation that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The President should, through appropriate action, require that allfederal departments and agencies adopt as a common core the regulationsgoverning research with human subjects issued by the Department of Healthand Human Services (codified at 45 CFR 46), as periodically amended orrevised, while permitting additions needed by any department or agencythat are not inconsistent with these core provisions.</ITAG>The <T3>Ad Hoc</T3> Committee agreed that uniformity is desirable among Departmentsand Agencies to eliminate unnecessary regulation and to promote increasedunderstanding and ease of compliance by institutions that conduct federallysupported or regulated research involving human subjects. Therefore, the<T3>Ad Hoc</T3> Committee developed a Model Federal Policy, which appliesto research involving human subjects that is conducted, supported or regulatedby Federal Departments and Agencies. In accordance with the Commission'srecommendation, the Model Federal Policy is based on Subpart A of the regulationsof HHS for the protection of human research subjects (45 CFR Part 46).The Proposed Model Federal Policy developed by the <T3>Ad Hoc</T3> Committee was modified by OSTP to enhance uniformity ofimplementation among the affected Federal Departments and Agencies andto provide consistency with other related policies. The revised Model FederalPolicy was concurred in by all affected Federal Departments and Agenciesin March 1985.An Interagency Human Subjects Coordinating Committee was chartered in October1983 under the auspices of FCCSET to follow the <T3>Ad Hoc</T3> Committee. It is composed of representatives of all FederalDepartments and Agencies that conduct, support or regulate research involvinghuman subjects. The Committee is advisory to Department and Agency Headsand, among other responsibilities, will evaluate the implementation ofthe Model Federal Policy and recommend modification as necessary.On June 3, 1986, OSTP published for public comment in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 20204) a Proposed Model Federal Policyfor Protection of Human Subjects and Response to the <T3>First Biennial Report</T3> of the President's Commission. Over 200written comments were received concerning the publication. The InteragencyHuman Subjects Coordinating Committee considered these comments in therevisions of the common Federal Policy which is proposed here for adoptionby each of the Departments and Agencies listed. Response to the publiccomments and discussion of revisions made in the Proposed Model FederalPolicy follow.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Description of Responses  </ITAG>Two hundred and thirty four comments were received during the sixty dayperiod following publication of the Proposed Model Federal Policy for Protectionof Human Subjects [51 FR 20204]. Approximately 40 comments came in afterthe close of the public comment period. Of all the responses 192 came frommedical schools and other academic institutions; 15 were from professionalassociations; 12 from Federal, state or county agencies, two from industry,and two from members of the public. Seventeen comments came from individualswho identified themselves as belonging to Institutional Review Boards (IRBs),and 36 were research administrators.  Almost unanimously, the respondents enthusiastically supported the conceptof a Model Federal Policy. A few noted that the June 3 <T4>Federal Register </T4>publication of the Proposed Model Federal Policydid not address HHS intentions on retaining 45 CFR Part 46, Subpart B,concerning fetuses, pregnant women and human <T3>in vitro </T3>fertilization involved in research; Subpart C, concerningadditional protections for prisoners as research subjects; and SubpartD, concerning children. HHS intends to retain Subparts B, C and D. TheNotices of Proposed Rulemaking published here are the proposed replacementof the current Subpart A of the HHS policy. It should also be noted thatthe Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, intends to retain additionalprotections for prisoners codified at 28 CFR Part 512.   Section __.103_Sixty Day Grace Period  The vast majority of the comments (223 of 234) addressed the ``60 day graceperiod'' which is included in HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(f) but notin the Proposed Model Federal Policy. The grace period is the time intervalbetween an institution's submission of a research grant application orcontract proposal to HHS and certification of the institution's IRB reviewand approval under current HHS regulations. Institutions that have MultipleProject Assurances on file with HHS have 60 days to finish IRB review andnotify HHS. Two hundred and nineteen respondents disagreed with the deletionof the grace period from the Model Federal Policy and asked that the graceperiod be reinstated in the final Model Federal Policy. Summaries of theirjustifications are given below.  The arguments in favor of retaining the grace period are primarily basedon the HHS time frame for preparation and review of research grant applicationsor contract proposals, the competitiveness of the review process and thequality of IRB review. For HHS-sponsored research there is usually abouta nine month interval between the date an application is received and theearliest date an award can be made. For new applications, especially thosewhich are submitted in response to a HHS Request for Applications, thetime for preparation of the proposal is only 30 to 90 days. Some respondentsindicated that this time frame is much different from the pace of biomedicalscience in which new publications, information or discoveries can makea methodology or approach obsolete within a few months. This discrepancyresults in pressure upon principal investigators to revise and amend applicationsand proposals up until the last day before submission so as to have thebest chance of success in the review process. Since an IRB cannot approvea tentative protocol, but must wait until the proposal is made final, requiringits review before the receipt date shortens an already brief preparationperiod and may adversely affect the quality of proposed research. Secondly,the requirement for prior IRB approval could adversely affect the qualityof review. The IRB would have to be convened on short notice with possiblereduced attendance by its members. This may well diminish the quality ofreview and create additional pressure on the IRB to approve proposals basedupon limited information.  Arguments in favor of omitting the grace period are also based on qualityof IRB review. These comments indicated that, if IRB review took place<T3>after </T3>a fundable priority score were obtained, the IRB might feelpressured to approve a questionable activity. In addition, the difficultiesof tracking down an application which is moving through the review processto append an IRB certification of approval creates an administrative burden. <T3>Response: </T3>The Interagency Human Subjects Coordinating Committeehas revised andSection;__.103(f) [andSection;__.103(g) in the Proposed ModelFederal Policy] to accommodate the concerns raised in the public comments.Under the revised section, the certification of IRB review and approvalmust accompany the application unless the Department or Agency specifiesa later date for submission of the certification.  Although HHS intends to amend its current regulations to incorporate thelanguage of the Model Federal Policy, it will retain a ``grace period''for institutions that have multiple project assurances and announce theperiod through advisories, e.g. <T3>OPRR Reports </T3>or <T3>Public Health Service Guide to Grants and Contracts, </T3>which areroutinely received by institutions. The ``grace period'' is the time betweensubmission of an application for research support and submission of certificationof IRB review and approval of the research proposed. Other Departmentsand Agencies will advise institutions of appropriate timing of certificationthrough similar publications.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Comments and Revisions  </ITAG>While the Interagency Committee considered each comment carefully, theCommittee made changes in the Proposed Model Federal Policy only when itdecided that the suggestions would accomplish the following: strengthenthe protections for human subjects; clarify the intention or requirementsof the Model Federal Policy; or facilitate the administrative processesrequired by the Model Federal Policy while maintaining or increasing humansubjects protections. Areas in which there were a number of comments arehighlighted below together with the rationale for the Interagency Committee'sincorporating changes or retaining the provisions addressed in these comments.  Sections __.101(b)(1) and __.101(b)(2)  <T3>Public Comments: </T3>One respondent suggested that no exemptions shouldbe allowed if vulnerable subjects are involved. Concerning andSection;__.101(b)(2),an exemption for certain types of research involving educational tests,survey procedures, interview procedures or observation of public behavior,one respondent noted that no mention is made of the potential impact thatcertain educational test surveys or interview procedures might have onchildren or adolescents and the Model Federal Policy should include considerationof this. To a few others, the rationale for the modifications was not clear.One response from an IRB recommended that no study involving educationaltests where identifiers are recorded should be exempt from review and suggestedthat there are risks that are significant in addition to criminal or civilliability noted in this exemption when educational tests are used withidentifiers. Another respondent thought that the Proposed Model FederalPolicy language in the exemptions lessened human subjects protections.Similarly, another response suggested that the language be broadened toshow that harming an individual's reputation in the community was a riskas well as financial standing and employability. Another comment indicatedthat if interviews yield identifiable data, regardless of the content,the research should be reviewed by an IRB.  <T3>Response: </T3>In response, the Interagency Human Subjects CoordinatingCommittee modified the language in andSection;__.101(b)(2)(ii) of the ModelFederal Policy to include the reputation of an individual as a considerationin determining whether research could be exempt. The Committee notes alsothat the Model Federal Policy exemptions at andSection;__.101 (b)(1) andandSection;__.101(b)(2) will make <T3>less </T3>research exempt than now under 45 CFR 46.101(b)(3) and (b)(4).  Section __.101(b)(3)  <T3>Public Comment: </T3>Section __.101(b)(3) exempts certain researchnot covered under andSection;__.101(b)(2), involving use of educational tests,survey procedures, interview procedures or observation of public behavior.Several respondents believed the wording here was unexplained, unclear,and possibly weakened protections for human subjects from those affordedby 45 CFR 46.101(b). A few other respondents felt that further defintionswould clarify the provisions. One response from an IRB indicated that fewIRB members would be able to judge if this exemption applies in the absenceof further legal guidance and that the exemption should be reconsidered.<T3>Response: </T3>The Interagency Human Subjects Coordinating Committeenotes that the exemptions as andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2>.101(b)(2) and andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2>.101(3) of the Model Federal Policy represent a consolidationof the exemptions at 45 CFR 46.101(b)(2), (3) and (4) of the current HHSregulations. The added portion at andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2>.101(b)(3)(ii) of the Model Federal Policy indicates thatsome types of research involving the use of educational tests, survey procedures,interview procedures or observation of public behavior are exempt if aFederal statute requires without exception that the confidentiality ofthe personally identifiable information will be maintained throughout theresearch and thereafter. The Department of Justice has indicated that 42U.S.C. 3789(g) is such a statute. The Department of Education intends totake a departure from the Model Federal Policy at andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2>.101(b)(3)(ii). The departure pertains only to research involvingthe use of educational tests, survey procedures, interview procedures,or observation of public behavior, conducted under a program subject tothe General Education Provisions Act and to the specific protections providedunder that Act to participants in programs administered by the Departmentof Education.   Section <T2>XXXX</T2>.101(b)(6) Public Comment: The proposed andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2>.101(b)(6) contains an exemption not found in 45 CFR Part46 for taste testing. Seven respondents endorsed the new exemption, butone of these suggested the inclusion of testing involving already broadlymarketed food containing approved types and levels of additives, unlessquantities are limited. Another comment from an IRB suggested that theprovisions on taste testing should require confidentiality.   <T3>Response: </T3>The Interagency Human Subjects Coordinating Committeemodified exemption andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2>.101(b)(6) to add that consumer acceptance studies are alsoincluded in the exemption. Also added to the exempton is a clarificationthat the food may contain an ingredient at or below the level and for ause found to be safe or an agricultural chemical or environmental contaminentat or below the level and for a use found to be safe by the FDA or approvedby the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the Food Safety InspectionService (FSIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). This clarificationis necessary because under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, an approvalof the use of a food additive sets forth not only the level at which thesubstance may be added, but also the technical effect for which it maybe added (e.g., as a preservative) and the types of food to which it maybe added (e.g., baked goods). Note that the exemption is not intended toapply to taste tests and quality evaluation studies if (1) a food ingredientis being tested, and (2) the test substance is <T3>not </T3>on the FDA's Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) list; nota permitted food additive as tested; not normally found in food at theconcentration being tested; is a pesticide; or contains a chemical residuefor which the acceptable level has not been established by the FDA, theEPA and the FSIS of the USDA.Section <T2>XXXX</T2>.101(h) <T3>Public Comment: </T3>This concerns research in foreign countries. Onerespondent endorsed this provision; another suggested that the IRB, ratherthan the Department or Agency Heads, should determine whether protectionsfor subjects in foreign countries are at least equivalent to those providedin the Proposed Model Federal Policy.   <T3>Response: </T3>No change has been made in this Section. The InteragencyCommittee concludes that there is a need for oversight at the federal levelconcerning protections for subjects in foreign countries.Section <T2>XXXX</T2>.102  Twelve respondents addressed the distinction between ``regulated research''and research that is ``conducted or supported'' by Federal Agencies orDepartments. (See andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2>.102 for a definition or regulated research.) Historically,one regulatory agency, the FDA, has relied on inspections of research projectsto ensure compliance with Federal regulations regarding protection of humansubjects. On the other hand, Departments and Agencies which sponsor research(e.g., HHS) have a system that requires that awardee institutions submitan assurance of compliance (assurance document) to the awarding Departmentor Agency which must be approved prior to the funding of research involvinghuman subjects.  Of the 12 comments about this distinction, 11 argued against preservingthe distinction. One respondent asserted that the continued distinctioncould be maintained without creating any problems for an institution thatis both supported and regulated. The other respondents felt that the continueddistinction was contrary to the aims of uniformity and consistency of theModel Federal Policy, and that it created an unnecessary administrativeburden on institutions that must comply with two sets of procedures. Onerespondent felt that the administrative distinctions were not burdensomeand that the distinction could be maintained without problems for institutionsat which both federally supported and regulated research are conducted.  <T3>Response: </T3>The Interagency Human Subjects Coordinating Committeeconsidered these comments but determined that the Model Federal Policyshould retain the distinction between ``regulated research'' and researchthat is ``conducted or supported'' by Federal Departments or Agencies.This distinction is necessary because ``regulated research'' is often privatelyfinanced by an array of sponsors ranging in size from multinational corporationsto individual physicians and is conducted at a variety of locations rangingfrom large university hospitals to community hospitals to physicians' offices.The provisions for regulated research, therefore, must accommodate thediverse needs of those engaging in regulated research while also ensuringthat human subjects are adequately protected. Requiring all sponsors tonegotiate assurances would place a significant burden on many sponsorsinvolved in regulated research, especially those engaged in research witha small number of patients in small institutions. For example, under thepresent regulatory structure, FDA will permit an investigational drug tobe used by a physician on one patient for a treatment use under a treatmentinvestigational new drug protocol or application (IND). For such a physician,the institution (if there is one), and the government, the assurance systemwould require a significant expenditure of time with little gain. Underthe existing system, which is not unduly burdensome, the physician mustobtain IRB approval and informed consent before administering the investigationaldrug. Absent Federal support, however, he or she would not be requiredto negotiate the assurance set forth in andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2>.103 of the Model Federal Policy. Eliminating the distinctionbetween ``regulated research'' and federally conducted or supported researchwould mean that the physician would be compelled to learn about the assurancesystem and then negotiate and file an assurance, even if the investigationaldrug were to be given once to only one person. Consequently, the needsof small institutions and investigators are best met through the methodspresently employed.  In addition, it should be noted that, contrary to the assertions made inseveral comments, the distinctions made for regulated research do not compellarge institutions where research is regularly conducted to satisfy twodifferent sets of regulations. A common set of provisions concerning IRBsand human subject protections apply to regulated research and to researchconducted or supported by Federal Departments or Agencies, and this willcontinue to be the case.  Thus, the distinction for regulated research and federally supported orconducted research in the Model Federal Policy embodies the most effectiveand efficient manner for ensuring that regulated research is conductedin a manner that will assure the protection of human subjects.Section <T2>XXXX</T2>.102(g) <T3>Public Comment: </T3>One respondent indicated that the term ``IRB''should be defined.<T3>Responses: </T3>A definition of IRB is now included in andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>. 102(g): ``IRB means an institutional review board establishedin accord with and for the purpose expressed in the Model Federal Policy.''Section <T2>XXX</T2>.103(a)Several public comments indicated that this section is confusing with regardto (1) with whom an institution should file an assurance; (2) to whom aninstitution should report modifications or amendments to existing assurances;and (3) to whom an institution should report adverse effects or acts ofnoncompliance [particularly andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.103(b)(3), (d), (e)]. Reporting some changes through OPRRwas suggested as a possibility. <T3>Response: </T3>The Interagency Human Subjects Coordinating Committeeredrafted andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.103 to place in a more prominent position the provision foundin andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.103(f) of the Proposed Model Federal Policy, which indicatesthat individual Department and Agency Heads <T3>shall </T3>accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriatefor the research in question, on file with OPRR and approved for federalwideuse by that office. When this type of assurance is used, all reports, exceptcertification, required by the Model Federal Policy, must be submittedto OPRR as well as to the appropriate Department and Agency Heads.In andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.103(b)(3), an addition has been made to clarify that changesin IRB membership are reported by institutions to the appropriate Departmentor Agency head unless, in accord with andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.103(a), the existence of an HHS approved assurance is accerptedin lieu of submission of an assurance. In this case, changes in IRB membershipare reported directly to OPRR. Section <T2>XXX</T2>.103(b)(5)<T3>Public Comment: </T3>Several comments addressed the requirements forandSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.103(b)(5), written procedures to ensure prompt reporting tothe IRB, appropriate institutional officials, and the Department of AgencyHead of any unanticipated problems or scientific misconduct involving risksto human subjects or others; any allegation or finding of serious or continuingnoncompliance with the Federal Model Policy or the requirement or determinationsof the IRB; and any suspension or termination of IRB approval. One IRB proposed language that would eliminate any implication that theIRB should necessarily be the body within an institution that is responsiblefor investigating and reporting noncompliance with human subjects regulations.More flexibility in administrative arrangements for reporting was urged.Other comments endorsed the proposed language of the Policy if there isrecognition that most institutions must have their own due process andif some flexibility is permitted in reporting scientific misconduct. Severalrespondents noted that the terms ``unanticipated problems,'' ``scientificmisconduct,'' and ``risks to others'' were unclear. Several respondents also indicated that institutions should not report<T3>allegations </T3>of misconduct and noncompliance_only results of investigationor inquiry about such to Federal Department and Agency Heads. It was arguedthat some flexibility must be given to institutions, and that institutionsshould be allowed to screen out allegations that are frivolous, michievousor lacking in substance. One respondent suggested that any additional policingactions are inappropriate and that only <T3>actions </T3>of institutions should be reported to Federal officials;otherwise, due process for researchers or other institutional personnelis jeopardized. Other reactions were that paperwork would increase if allegationsare reported and that an institution would be hesitant to use the suspensionmechanism as a management tool if such a suspension must be reported toFederal offices because of infractions such as tardiness in respondingto an IRB. <T3>Response: </T3>The Interagency Committee clarifies that the word ``others''in andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.103(b)(5)(i) denotes other persons who are participating inclinical trials under the same or similar protocols or who may be affectedby products or procedures that were developed on the basis of inappropriateor questionable research. In addition, in andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.103(b)(5)(ii) the Interagency Committee has modified the ModelFederal Policy to delete the word ``allegation.'' This Section now indicatesthat written procedures in assurances must ensure prompt reporting to theIRB, appropriate institutional officials, and the department or AgencyHead of any instance of serious or continuing noncompliance with the Policyor the requirements or determinations of the IRB. While the InteragencyCommittee did not intend that institutions report frivolous situations,it does expect institutions to report serious instances of noncompliancein which there is some reasonable substantiation, even if a final institutionaldetermination has not yet been made. In such cases, the Committee alsoexpects prompt notification of the final decision by the institutions.Section <T2>XXX</T2>.103(f)<T3>Public Comment: </T3>Four respondents endorsed this section; one othernoted that this provision was valuable to the IRB, and one suggested thatit was a valuable provision in easing administrative burdens if the Officefor Protection from Research Risks will accept minor rewording changesin current assurances on file to reflect changes in HHS regulations thatresult from adoption of the Model Federal Policy. <T3>Response: </T3>Section <T2>XXX</T2>.103(f) in the Proposed Model Federal Policy has been movedto andSection; <T2>XXX</T2>.103(a). This section requires individual Department and AgencyHeads, in lieu of requiring submission of a separate assurance, to acceptthe existence of a current assurance on file with the Office for Protectionfrom Research Risks, HHS, which has been approved for federalwide use bythat office. Also, this section has been modified slightly to indicatethat not all types of assurances on file in OPRR are appropriate for federalwideuse. Section <T2>XXX</T2>.107(a) and (b)<T3>Public Comment: </T3>Section <T2>XXX</T2>.107 addresses IRB membership. One response indicated thatthe membership requirements for IRBs have been changed in a way that decreasesthe protection to vulnerable groups in research projects. Five commentators wrote with some concern about the language changes inthis section from the language in the current HHS regulations, as follows.One response indicated distress over the language changes because the presenceof an advocate for a vulnerable group as a voting member of the IRB hasbeen of immense value, and strong language is urged to require membersconcerned with special populations. Several others commented that the ModelFederal Policy language regarding representation of vulnerable subjectsis weak compared to the HHS regulations, so that the welfare of vulnerablesubjects may not be adequately represented. One response also reflectedthat it is ``risky'' to remove required representation for vulnerable subjects,and it should be mandatory that representatives of the subject populationserve as full members of the IRB. Section <T2>XXXX</T2> .107(b), which addresses gender considerations in IRB selection,elicited a comment that the language eliminates bias or discrimination,but seven others indicated a negative response to the change from the currentHHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.107(b) and urged retention of the requirementthat no IRB may consist entirely of men or entirely of women. One respondentwrote that the new language is confusing, and that the term ``nondiscriminatoryeffort'' used in andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2> .107(b) is unclear.<T3>Response:</T3> The Interagency Committee expects that institutionswill use good judgment and diligence in selecting persons as IRB memberswho can fulfill the requirements of andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2> .107(a), so that persons of varying backgrounds will promotecomplete and adequate review of the research activities. In approving assurances,the Federal Departments and Agencies that conduct, support or regulatethe research will review IRB composition to ensure that the membershipis appropriate for the research, and may request that membership be supplementedif complete and adequate review of the research does not appear possible.Concerning gender representation of the IRB, the Interagency Committeenotes that in seeking diverse membership on the IRB, the institution mustconsider both men and women who can contribute to the role of the IRB.Given the ready availability of well qualified persons of both genders,the Interagency Committee expects that only rarely, if ever, will an IRBconsist solely of men or solely of women.Section <T2>XXXX</T2> .107(c) and (d)<T3>Public Comment:</T3> Section <T2>XXXX</T2> .107(c) and (d) require IRBs to include at least one scientificmember, at least one nonscientific member and at least one member unaffiliatedwith the institution. One comment was that changing the current 45 CFR46.107(c) language to require one scientific member constitutes an improvement,but consideration should be given to smaller, particularly rural, institutions.Some allowance for review by a cooperating institution should be made,it was suggested.<T3>Response:</T3> The Interagency Human Subjects Coordinating Committeenotes that andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2> .114 permits agreements between cooperating institutionsunder which the institution may, with the approval of the Department orAgency, use joint review, rely upon the review of another qualified IRB,or make other review arrangements aimed at avoiding a duplication of effort.Section <T2>XXXX</T2> .110<T3>Public Comment:</T3> Section <T2>XXXX</T2> .110 sets forth requirements for expedited review. Five respondentsexpressed concern that the conditions under which Department or AgencyHeads may suspend, restrict or terminate approval of expedited review arenot specified and that, consequently, each Head could have a separate agreementwhich might be burdensome for research institutions. One respondent suggesteda clarification to indicate that a minor change in approved research couldhave an expedited review procedure <T3>only</T3> within the one year minimum annual review period of the IRB.<T3>Response:</T3> The parenthetical clarification ``(of one year or less)''has been added to andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2> .110(a)(b)(2) to clarify the period for which IRB approvalis authorized.The Interagency Committee expects that Department and Agency Heads willbase the authority to use expedited review on the ``track record'' of theinstitutions involved. For example, HHS generally permits institutionswith Multiple Project Assurances to utilize the expedited review procedure.Other institutions may not use this type of review.Section <T2>XXXX</T2> .111<T3>Public Comment:</T3> This section sets forth the criteria for IRB approvalof research. A few commented on andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2> .111(a)(3) concerning equitable selection of subjects, asfollows: (1) Institutions should be provided with a clear definition of``economically or educationally disadvantaged'' persons; and (2) institutionsneed guidelines on involvement of these populations in research beforethey are included in the list of vulnerable populations. Another suggestedthat an additional safeguard would be that the IRB require an explanationby the investigator as to why research needs to be conducted involvinga vulnerable population and that the IRB certify that such involvementis necessary. Another comment was that pregnant women should not necessarilybe considered members of a vulnerable population.<T3>Response:</T3> The Interagency Human Subjects Coordinating Committeemade no changes in the Model Federal Policy at this time that specificallyaddress these public comments but is concerned about adequate protectionsfor vulnerable subjects and equitable selection of subjects and is continuingto study these issues. Section 107(a) of the Model Federal Policy has beenmodified to strengthen consideration of interests of vulnerable subjects.Section <T2>XXXX</T2> .114<T3>Public Comment:</T3> Section <T2>XXXX</T2> .114 concerns cooperative research. Five responses raisedthe following points. The current provisions could result in many differentrequirements if each Department or Agency Head can make a determinationabout cooperative research projects. Similarly, one concern expressed wasthat the Model Federal Policy should permit cooperating institutions todecide among themselves how to enter into various alternatives named inthe section, rather than require institutions first to obtain permissionfrom the Department or Agency; to eliminate paperwork and time burdensdoes not further the protection of human subjects. The section appearedto another commentator as a hindrance to cooperative effort at the ``grassroots'' level where working together should be encouraged. Other suggestionswere that the section should be expanded to include specific details forinstitutions, and that it should be made clear that the requirement forIRB review of cooperative research applies whether or not funds are involved.<T3>Response:</T3> The Interagency Committee has formulated the Model FederalPolicy in such a way that Department and Agency heads retain the authorityto determine what levels and loci of review are appropriate, given thenature of the research to be conducted or supported and their judgmentabout the experience and expertise of the institutions to be involved inthe collaborative research. In this way a balance between uniform reviewstandards and flexibility can be maintained to protect human subjects ofresearch.Section <T2>XXXX</T2> .121<T3>Public Comment:</T3> Section <T2>XXXX</T2> .121 is reserved. Some respondents questioned whether theprovisions of 45 CFR 46.121 are still applicable since the comparable sectionin the Model Federal Policy is now reserved.<T3>Response:</T3> The Interagency Human Subjects Coordinating Committeeclarifies that the FDA requirements referenced in 45 CFR 46.121 (i.e.,21 U.S.C. 312, 355, 357, 812) still apply. However, the information calledfor by 45 CFR 46.121 was considered no longer necessary. This section hasbeen designated as reserved in the Model Federal Policy so that the parallelnumbering sequence between the HHS and FDA regulations for the protectionof human subjects could be retained in the current Model Federal Policy.Section __.124<T3>Public Comment: </T3>Section __.124 states that Department and AgencyHeads may impose additional conditions necessary for the protection ofhuman subjects. One respondent expressed hope that the Department and AgencyHeads would limit additional conditions to those required by statute.<T3>Response: </T3>The Interagency Human Subjects Coordinating Committeeagrees and indicates that it will work toward uniformity among Departmentsand Agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Departures Proposed by Departments and Agencies</ITAG><T3>Public Comment: </T3>Several comments expressed concern that deviationsfrom the Model Federal Policy could be abused, and departures should belimited only to those required by statute.Concerning the VA departure, one comment stated that the Federal Departmentsand Agencies with which many universities are affiliated should be requiredto file assurances with OPRR when research administered by the affiliatedinstitution is performed in a VA facility. Another urged that consent documentsbe as similar as possible among university hospitals, county hospitalsand VA hospitals.<T3>Response: </T3>The VA indicated that specification to the level ofdetail noted in the comments is beyond the level which is appropriate fora Model Federal Policy, and that cooperative arrangements are properlyclarified by individual Departments and Agencies. VA elects to requirethat VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) which participate in cooperative or multi-hospitalresearch projects obtain approval from their own IRBs for such researchand does not contemplate approving andSection; __.114 arrangements inconsistentwith this policy. VA also elects not to require that VAMCs submit writteninstitutional assurances under andSection; __.103(a) to the VA Central Office.As the official responsible for the operation of VA research facilities,the Administrator will employ procedures other than the submission of writtenassurance from subordinate officials to assure compliance with VA policies.On the issue of departures, the VA notes the statutory directive that itadopt the Model Federal Policy ``to the maximum extent feasible consistentwith other [statutory] provisions'' which govern its conduct. 38 U.S.C.4134. It has determined that adoption of the Model Federal Policy withoutdepartures is ``feasible'' and, thus, has withdrawn the departures notedin the June 3 <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice. It notes, however, that certain provisionsof the Model Federal Policy, particularly andSection; __.101(b) and andSection;__.116(c) and (d), will be narrowly construed in order to avoid inconsistencywith other statutory directives.FDA indicates that it has concurred in the Model Federal Policy. Sincethe Agency has already adopted regulations on informed consent (21 CFRPart 50) and on IRBs (21 CFR Part 56) elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, FDA is proposing to amend those regulationsto eliminate certain inconsistencies with the Model Federal Policy. Nonetheless,because of the statutory requirements described in the proposal (51 FR20216), FDA's regulations will continue to depart from andSection; __.101(h)(requirements for foreign research) and andSection; __.116(d) (waiver ofinformed consent) of the Model Federal Policy.The Department of Education proposes to make a departure from andSection;__.101(b)(3)(ii) of the Model Federal Policy that pertains only to researchinvolving the use of educational tests, survey procedures, interview procedures,or observations of public behavior, conducted under a program subject tothe General Education Provisions Act. Under this departure the exemptionto the Model Federal Policy is revised to read as follows: ``The researchis conducted under a program subject to the protections of the GeneralEducation Provisons Act (GEPA), including GEPA sections 400A (20 U.S.C.1221-3), 438 (20 U.S.C. 1232g), and 439 (20 U.S.C. 1232h).''The Department of Education proposes also to make a departure from section107(a) of the Model Federal Policy that pertains to membership of IRBs.This departure results from the special concern of the Department to provideadditional safeguards in the Policy for mentally disabled persons and handicappedchildren who are subjects of research. Under this departure, the finalsentences in section 107(a) of the Policy are revised to read as follows:``When an IRB reviews research that deals with handicapped children ormentally disabled persons, the IRB shall include at least one person primarilyconcerned with the welfare of the research subjects. If an IRB regularlyreviews research that involves other vulnerable categories of subjects,such as non-handicapped children, prisoners, or pregnant women, considerationshall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgeableabout and experienced in working with these subjects.''The HHS is withdrawing its departure from the proposed Model Federal Policyindicated in the June 3, 1986, <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This is a provision which is now found in thecurrent HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.101(i): ``If, following review ofproposed research activities that are exempt from these regulations underparagraph (b)(6), [of the current HHS regulations] the Secretary determinesthat a research or demonstration project presents a danger to the physical,mental, or emotional well-being of a participant or subject of the researchor demonstration project, then federal funds may not be expended for sucha project without the written informed consent of each participant or subject.''While the Department has an obligation, pursuant to the conditions imposedupon its appropriations, to ensure that research activities do not presenta danger to the physical, mental or emotional well-being of participants,as enacted by the most recent continuing appropriations act for HHS, thisstatutory requirement will be accomplished under andSection; __.101(d). Thissection indicates that Department or Agency heads may require that specificresearch activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported,or otherwise subject to regulation by the department or agency but nototherwise covered by this policy, comply with some or all of the requirementsof this policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Lists of Subjects in the Notices of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>Protection of human research subjects, Research conducted, supported, regulated,Institutional review boards, Informed consent, Cooperative research, Researchinvestigators, Research institutions, Assurances of Compliance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="52">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">7 CFR Part 1c</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is proposed that Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations beamended by adding Part 1c as set forth at the end of this document.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1c_PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.101 To what does this policy apply?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.102 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.103 Assuring compliance with this policy_research conducted orsupported by any Federal department or agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.104_1c.106 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.107 IRB Membership.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.108 IRB functions and operations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.109 IRB review of research.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.110 Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involvingno more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.111 Criteria for IRB approval of research.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.112 Review by institution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.113 Suspension or termination of IRB approval of research.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.114 Cooperative research.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.115 IRB records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.116 General requirements for informed consent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.117 Documentation of informed consent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.118 Applications and proposals lacking definite plans for involvementof human subjects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.119 Research undertaken without the intention of involving humansubjects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.120 Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals forresearch to be conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.121 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.122 Use of Federal funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.123 Early termination of research support: Evaluation of applicationsand proposals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1c.124 Conditions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 301; 42 U.S.C. 300v-1(b).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Peter C.

(d) ``Research'' means a systematic investigation, including research development,testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizableknowledge. Activities which meet this definition constitute ``research''for purposes of this policy, whether or not they are conducted or supportedunder a program which is considered research for other purposes. For example,some ``demonstration'' and ``service'' programs may include research activities.(e) ``Research subject to regulation,'' and similar terms are intendedto encompass those research activities for which a federal department oragency has specific responsibility for regulating as a research activity,(for example, Investigational New Drug requirements administered by theFood and Drug Administration). It does not include research activitieswhich are incidentally regulated by a federal department or agency solelyas part of the department's or agency's broader responsibility to regulatecertain types of activities whether research or non-research in nature(for example, Wage and Hour requirements administered by the Departmentof Labor). (f) ``Human subject'' means a living individual about whom an investigator(whether professional or student) conducting research obtains: (1) Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or (2) Identifiable private information. <ITAG tagnum="10">``Intervention'' includes both physical procedures by which data aregathered (for example, venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject orthe subject's environment that are performed for research purposes. ``Interaction''includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator andsubject. ``Private information'' includes information about behavior thatoccurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that noobservation or recording is taking place, and information which has beenprovided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individualcan reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a medical record).Private information must be individually identifiable (i.e., the identityof the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator orassociated with the information) in order for obtaining the informationto constitute research involving human subjects. (g) ``IRB'' means an institutional review board established in accord withand for the purposes expressed in this policy. (h) ``IRB approval'' means the determination of the IRB that the researchhas been reviewed and may be conducted at an institution within the constraintsset forth by the IRB and by other institutional and federal requirements.(i) ``Minimal risk'' means that the probability and magnitude of harm ordiscomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselvesthan those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performanceof routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. (j) ``Certification'' means the official notification by the institutionto the supporting department or agency, in accordance with the requirementsof this policy, that a research project or activity involving human subjectshas been reviewed and approved by an IRB in accordance with an approvedassurance. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; </ITAG><T2>XXXX</T2>.103 <ITAG tagnum="89">Assuring compliance with this policy_research conducted or supportedby any federal department or agency. </ITAG>(a) Each institution engaged in research which is covered by this policyand which is conducted or supported by a federal department or agency willprovide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency headthat it will comply with the requirements set forth in this policy. Inlieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department oragency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropratefor the research in question, on file with the Office for Protection fromResearch Risks, HHS, and approved for federalwide use by that office. Whenthe existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiringsubmission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required bythis policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be madeto the Office for Protection from Research Risks, HHS. (b) Departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered bythis policy only if the institution has an assurance approved as providedin this section, and only if the institution has certified to the departmentor agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRBprovided for in the assurance, and will be subject to continuing reviewby the IRB. Assurances applicable to federally supported or conducted researchshall at a minimum include: (1) A statement of principles governing the institution in the dischargeof its responsibilities for protecting the rights and welfare of humansubjects of research conducted at or sponsored by the institution, regardlessof whether the research is subject to federal regulation. This may includean appropriate existing code, declaration, or statement of ethical principles,or a statement formulated by the institution itself. This requirement doesnot preempt provisions of this policy applicable to department- or agency-supportedor regulated research and need not be applicable to any research exemptedor waived under andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2>.101 (b) or (i). (2) Designation of one or more IRBs established in accordance with therequirements of this policy, and for which provisions are made for meetingspace and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and recordkeepingduties.

The department or agency head may limit the period duringwhich any particular approved assurance or class of approved assurancesshall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict approval. (f) Certification is required when the research is supported by a federaldepartment or agency and not otherwise exempted or waived under andSection;<T2>XXXX</T2>.101 (b) or (i). An institution with an approved assuranceshall certify that each application or proposal for research covered bythe assurance and by andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2>.103 of this policy has been reviewed and approved by theIRB.

In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB shouldconsider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research(as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receiveeven if not participating in the research). The IRB should not considerpossible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research(for example, the possible effects of the research on public policy) asamong those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRBshould take into account the purposes of the research and the setting inwhich the research will be conducted and should be particularly cognizantof the special problems of research involving vulnerable populations, suchas children, prisoners, pregnant women, mentally disabled persons, or economicallyor educationally disadvantaged persons.(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or thesubject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and tothe extent required by andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2> .116.(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with,and to the extent required by andSection; <T2>XXXX</T2> .117.(6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoringthe data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.(7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacyof subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.(b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercionor undue influence, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, mentallydisabled persons, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons,additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rightsand welfare of these subjects.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; </ITAG><T2>XXXX</T2> .112<ITAG tagnum="89">Review by institution.</ITAG>Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may besubject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by officialsof the institution.
