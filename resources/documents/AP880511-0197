Chase Manhattan Bank was the first to announce the increase andwas quickly followed by Citibank, Chemical Bank, ManufacturersHanover, Continental Illinois Bank, Mellon Bank and Marine MidlandBank.   Other big banks also were expected to increase the key rate,which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base rate onloans to many businesses and for consumer loans, includinghome-equity loans.   The impact was felt on Wall Street, where the the Dow Jonesaverage of 30 industrial stocks was down about 44 points to the1,959 level by midafternoon.   Many economists had predicted an increase in the prime rate,which often lags behind rising interest rates elsewhere, becausethe cost of borrowing for banks themselves has been rising inrecent weeks.   The higher borrowing costs reflect a fear of higher inflation,which has been fed by evidence that the economy is growing faster _especially figures reported by the government last week that showedunemployment had hit a 14-year low.   These inflation worries have led the Federal Reserve Board, thenation's central bank, to nudge short-term interest rates higher.For example the federal funds rate, the overnight interest on loansamong banks, has risen above 7 percent, compared with around 6.6percent less than two months ago.   The last time banks raised the prime rate was in September, whenit went from 8.75 percent to 9.25 percent. The rate dropped back to9 percent on Oct. 22, two days after the Black Monday stockcollapse. It fell to 8.75 percent Nov. 5 and fell to 8.5 percentFeb. 2.</TEXT></DOC>
