The results indicate a slight thaw in Israeli attitudes toward aPalestinian state. A similar survey conducted a decade ago foundthat nine out of 10 opposed the formation of a Palestinian state andbelieved it would threaten Israel.   The current survey, conducted by the Israel Institute of AppliedSocial Research, asked a nationwide sample of 1,192 Israeli Jews ifthey would ``accept or oppose the establishment of a Palestinianstate.''   Seventy-seven percent said they would oppose a separatePalestinian state, and 23 percent said they would accept it.   In a second question, the institute asked ``Do you believe aPalestinian state on the West Bank would threaten or not threatenthe security of the state of Israel?''   About 80 percent said such a state would be threatening.   ``It's still a very high number, but there is a certain thawingwhich is very slow ... but in a dovish direction,'' said Elihu Katz,director of the private institute.   The survey was conducted last month and involved Jews 20 yearsand older, Katz said. He said it was the latest in a series begun in1967, when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jordanand Egypt in the Middle East war.   Katz said the institute does not officially quote a margin oferror for its surveys but estimated it to be in a range of 3 to 5percent.</TEXT></DOC>
