On other markets, frozen pork-belly futures plunged the permitteddaily limit of 2 cents a pound; livestock futures were mixed; grainsand soybeans were mixed; energy futures rose; and precious metalsretreated.   Lumber settled $3.40 to $4 lower on the Chicago MercantileExchange with the contract for delivery in March at $182.80 per1,000 board-feet.   The decline followed increases in both the prime lending rate,which is the benchmark on which banks base their loan rates, and thediscount rate, the interest rate that the Fed charges on loans toits member banks.   Most major banks raised their prime rates 0.5 percentage point to11.5 percent while the Fed upped its discount rate to 7 percent from6.5 percent. The increases were seen as efforts to fight inflationby slowing down the economy.   Bud Merrill, a lumber market analyst with Shearson Lehman HuttonInc. in Eugene, Ore., said the higher interest rates could lead to asubstantial weakening of the lumber market, which has been in atwo-year upswing.   ``I tend to believe we're going to be under pressure at leastuntil the early part of spring,'' Merrill said.   Futures prices for frozen pork bellies fell steeply on theChicago Merc ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly coldstorage report, which was expected to show record-high supplies ofthe unsliced bacon meat in the nation's commercial meat lockers.   The report, which was released after the close, confirmed thoseexpectations. It showed 113.4 million pounds of bellies in coldstorage as of Feb. 1, far surpassing both the year-ago figure of 63million pounds and the previous Feb. 1 record of 90.2 million poundsset in 1981.   The report also showed record-high total pork supplies andsuggested that both turkey and ham would be in abundant supply forEaster.   Analysts said the massive pork-belly supply could become a majordepressant on the futures market this summer unless retailersstimulate the movement of bellies out of storage by cutting baconprices, which now average about $1.49 a pound.   ``We need to knock 50 cents off the retail bacon price in a huryor this market's goose is cooked,'' said Charles Levitt, Shearson'schief livestock market analyst in Chicago.   Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .23 cent higher with Aprilat 78.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .30 centlower with March at 83.62 cents a pound; live hogs were .23 centlower to .20 cent higher with April at 43.52 cents a pound; frozenpork bellies were 1.32 cents to 2 cents lower with March at 37.42cents a pound.   Wheat futures moved substantially higher on the Chicago Board ofTrade amid bullish chart signals and rumors of impending exportsales. Other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed inlight trading.   Wheat settled 5 cents to 7 cents higher with March at $4.34 abushel; corn was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $2.71{a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.06\a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents lower to 4\ cents higher with Marchat $7.61 a bushel.   Crude oil spurted above $18 a barrel on the New York MercantileExchange on news that Colombia planned to freeze its oil exports tohelp boost prices, a move seen as strengthening OPEC's hand.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 24 centshigher with April at $18.07 a barrel; heating oil was .40 cent to1.14 cents higher with March at 51.73 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .30 cent to .50 cent higher with March at 50.11 cents agallon.
