Advance men and women are a loosefraternity with their own lore (&quot;Remember the kid they toldto find a speech site for a speech by Kefauver&quot; -- orKennedy, or Romney -- &quot;and he asked the locals what's themost popular nightspot in town, and he booked it, and thatnight he gets there all proud with Kefauver and it's a stripjoint? And Kefauver makes the speech?&quot;). They have their owntraditions and even language (&quot;When is the candidateleaving?&quot; &quot;Wheels up 4 p.m.&quot;)   Advance makes sure the man who heads the receiving lineisn't a convicted child molester; they make sure the soundsystem works, the press can file, the crowd shows. They areamong the indispensables of politics, and generallyunderappreciated. Good Advance means only that Brit Hume willnot lead with &quot;In a haphazardly planned event that neverreally got off the ground&quot; -- cut to picture of presidentialcandidate tripping over exposed cables on way to podium andknocking over row of girl scouts. Bad Advance means, in abeneficent campaign, one more and you're out. And so Advancepeople take on the tics of the trade: a certain jut-jawedintensity, an addiction to jogging and junk food, and adesire to carry on three conversations at the same time onthe car phone, the cellular phone, and the radio.</LP><TEXT>   When Mikhail Gorbachev visits Minneapolis and St. Paul,Minn., this Sunday (ETA lunchtime, wheels up early evening) asmall army of a few dozen Advance veterans called in by thegovernor's office and the business community will have pavedthe way. I spoke to one just after midnight Wednesday. Afterthe negotiations -- &quot;Don't put my name in, I'm no big deal,you can quote but not for attribution, and check all spellingwith your desk&quot; -- the Advance person settled in to chatwhile waiting for room service.   What's happening?   &quot;Right now we're waiting for the Twins to beat the Oriolesso we can roll a few hundred tables onto the Astroturf. TheInternational Press Center is the field of the Hubert H.Humphrey Metrodome. There'll be hundreds of phones and copymachines and faxes. The Russians particularly asked forfaxes. The filing center is in right field. The press officeis on the right field foul line. The technician's lounge isin center field. The food's in left field. They may need newturf there when it's over.&quot;   How are things going?   &quot;We're tearing our hair out. Reporters are calling andsaying `Three days out and you don't have a schedule, oh haha.' We don't know how many events we have. Normally at thispoint in the trip Americans would be going over the schedulewith a fine-toothed comb. But we don't have a schedule. TheRussians won't tell us what they want to do. They're notbeing secretive or balky; they just don't know. Or they can'tget Gorbachev's people to sign off. They're still`considering' everything.&quot;   This is what they're considering: Mrs. Gorbachev may visita typical American family in south Minneapolis. (So far thedesignated family is that of Karen and Steve Watson and theirfour children. A local paper said of them Wednesday: &quot;They'rethe Watsons, not the Cleavers. Their home is modest and wellkept, but not too modest or too well kept.&quot; He's anelementary-school art teacher, she's a nurse. Their dog ishalf Irish setter and half golden retriever. Mr. Watson isthinking of showing Mrs. Gorbachev the dishwasher and thelaundry room.) Both Gorbachevs may attend an ecumenicalservice in the big Roman Catholic cathedral in St. Paul. Theymay visit an art museum. They may briefly get out of thecity. &quot;The Soviet and American advance, Soviet security andthe Secret Service went off on a bus today to look at farms.&quot;   What have the Soviets said yes to? An airport arrivalceremony, which is to include every member of the Minnesotacongressional delegation; a luncheon in the governor'smansion -- &quot;So far the Soviets want it private, no press&quot;;and a meeting with business leaders, probably featuring Qandamp;Awith Mr. Gorbachev. Who will be there? &quot;All the hitters andCEOs. This is definitely a business trip, no question.&quot;   How do you know?   &quot;You can tell when you talk to them.&quot; Who? &quot;The RussianAdvance guys. They came in last week.&quot; Are they like AmericanAdvance guys? &quot;No, not the same manic attention to detail.&quot;   Minnesota is the headquarters of Cargill, a company thatsells grain to the Soviet Union. Minnesota is also home to 24Fortune 500 companies, including 3-M, Honeywell, Pillsbury,General Mills and Control Data Corp. Control Data is probablythe touchiest of these names. The Soviets have an order inwith the firm to buy $32 million of Cyber 962 mainframecomputers -- computers that some say could have the kind ofmilitary applications that used to be blocked undertechnology-transfer rules. But the Russians are expecting toget Washington's approval on the hardware deal shortly.Advance people, for their part, sometimes refer to thetransaction as &quot;selling the Soviets computers that havesomething to do with nuclear tests.&quot;   One senses the state's attitude toward the Gorbachev visitis not unlike that of a wife who has been hastily informedthat tomorrow night the husband's best potential customerever is coming to dinner; the silverware's out, the flowershave been ordered and the tablecloth is being ironed. Fromthe moment the Soviets accepted Gov. Rudy Perpich'sinvitation, boosters and businessmen went into high gear.Within 24 hours they had a Gorbachev Visit Office in a newdowntown office building -- 7,000 square feet of office spacedonated by Carlson Co., a local holding company. IBM came inand donated all computer operations. U S West, the localphone company, donated all cellular and desk phones, pagers,beepers and radio phones.   &quot;You should see the people out there. Every business intown is offering people and products and calling in to help.It's incredible. It's like Super Bowl fever. On local TVthey're showing kids learning Russian songs and Russianphrases in the schools. I don't mean Berlitz is gonna getbought out on language tapes, but the spirit is incredible.I'm blown away by the business community. It's Gorby fever.It's like when people are psyched up for a Super Bowl. I'dlike to see people get this psyched up over a president.&quot;   What about the local political implications? There wastalk recently that the Gorbachev coup would re-elect RudyPerpich this fall.   &quot;Listen, let me run this down for you. Perpich is bringingto Minnesota in 1991, for the first time, the U.S. Open. Alsoin '91 he's got the International Special Olympics. In '92he's got the NCAA final four and the Super Bowl. And he gotGorbachev. So I don't know what his problems are but he mustbe feeling pretty good.&quot; Wednesday night, when Mr. Perpichwalked into the daily Advance countdown meeting in aconference room at the Radisson Plaza Hotel, he got astanding ovation.   Has the Advance person been told of anything special Mr.Gorbachev is going to do, such as, oh, speak a sentence ortwo of English for a perfect seven-second bite on thenetworks? Something homey and American and aimed also at thefolks back home, like, &quot;Don't change horses in midstream&quot;?&quot;No, no speech is planned.&quot;   Who is in the Russian party?   The Advance person sighs. &quot;We don't know, we're trying tofind out exactly from Washington.&quot; Do you know how manypeople are in the Russian party? &quot;No, but it's not like fiveto six, not like 100. A few dozen.&quot;   Anything more on the schedule?   &quot;No. But it'll be whirlwind.&quot;   When will the Gorbachevs get to rest?   &quot;That's called `private time.' It's built into theschedule. The Radisson Hotel's got rooms for them. So youknow, Mrs. Gorbachev can go into the bathroom if she wants toget the governor's wife out of her face. Oh, this isinteresting. The Russians know Gorbachev's spontaneous. Theyknow their guys like we know our guys. They're telling usthey don't know what he'll do. They're not even asking aboutthe motorcade route -- you know, so we could help themarrange a crowd for a spontaneous jump out of the limo. We'refinding out the spontaneous thing is genuine.&quot;   With Lithuania unresolved, with Moscow bracing for panicbuying in a K mart without inventory, with Yeltsin rising,any contingency plans for a Gorbachev defection?   The Advance person pauses.   &quot;Actually, a woman at yesterday's meeting said, `What dowe do if when he gets to the cathedral he asks forsanctuary?' Everybody laughed.&quot;   ---   Miss Noonan wrote speeches for President Reagan and GeorgeBush and is the author of &quot;What I Saw at the Revolution: APolitical Life in the Reagan Era&quot; (Random House).</TEXT></DOC>
