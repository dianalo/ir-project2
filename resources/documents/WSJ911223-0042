That's the latest prediction from economists and moneymanagers in the wake of the Federal Reserve's surprisinglyaggressive move Friday to drive down short-term interestrates. These analysts see only one thing that could keeprates from declining further: an ill-conceived rush byCongress to cut taxes or take other steps that would balloonthe federal budget deficit.</LP><TEXT>   On Friday, the Fed slashed the discount rate, the rate itcharges member banks for loans, by a full percentage point to3.5%, a 27-year low. At the same time, it pushed down thefederal funds rate, which banks charge each other forovernight loans, by 1/2 percentage point to 4%.   The Fed's dramatic easing ignited a sharp bond marketrally. By the day's end, yields on short-term Treasury bills-- which have been declining for more than a year -- hadfallen to the lowest level in decades, while yields onlong-term bonds had sunk to five-year lows.   The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to 7.58%, thelowest level since early 1987. The yield on three-monthTreasury bills slipped to 3.8%, the lowest rate in 20 years.Despite these sharp declines, market analysts expect bondyields to fall even further as the Federal Reserve easesmonetary policy again in coming months in response to weakeconomic data.   &quot;Bonds feel good right now; I think we'll see yields {onthe benchmark 30-year bond} at 7%,&quot; says Samuel Thorne,portfolio strategist at mutual fund manager Scudder, Stevensandamp; Clark. Mr. Thorne, like many other analysts, expects to seea wave of layoffs by businesses during the first quarter. Asthe economy deteriorates, the inflation outlook will improve,he says.   &quot;I'm not worried about inflation in the short-term,&quot; saysMr. Thorne. &quot;Look at commodity prices; silver and gold aredown, as are other metals. Oil prices are down even with thecurrent cold snap. This is not the stuff of inflation.&quot;   International Strategy Investment Group Inc., a moneymanager in New York, has been keeping a running total oflayoff announcements by major corporations as they appear innews articles. Since mid-July, ISI has counted 196 layoffannouncements, 57 of which have been made in just the lastsix weeks. &quot;Most of these probably won't be implemented untilthe first quarter&quot; of 1992, ISI's Edward Hyman and NancyLazar wrote in their weekly economic report. (The latest ISIreport came out prior to General Motors Corp.'s announcementlate last week that it will eliminate 74,000 jobs by 1995.)   The two economists now believe that the current recession,which at one time was expected to be short and mild, may windup as the longest recession in history.   &quot;If the economy is still in recession, as we believe, thenDecember will be the 18th month of recession -- surpassingthe 16-month recessions of 1974 and 1982,&quot; wrote Mr. Hymanand Ms. Lazar.   Based on that pessimistic view of the economy, ISI alsobelieves that yields on the Treasury's long-term benchmarkbond will fall to 7%, providing bond market investors withmore gains.   But some economists warn that the path to lower ratescould be interrupted by Congressional efforts to fashionfiscal stimulus programs, such as a tax cut. And even ifCongress doesn't disturb the market, they say, the bondmarket is unlikely to produce next year the lush 14% -- plusreturns, including interest payments and price gains, thatinvestors have racked up so far this year. The economists saythis is because there simply is a limit to how low rates cango.   &quot;The big question is what will Congress come up with whenthey return&quot; to Washington in January after the Christmasrecess, says Donald Fine, chief bond market analyst at ChaseManhattan Bank Corp. He says that with economic indicators,and to a larger degree anecdotal evidence, portraying theeconomy as extremely sick, there is a chance that Congressmay devise a quick-fix fiscal stimulative plan that couldboost the budget deficit or otherwise trigger inflationarypressures.   &quot;This is where it gets tricky,&quot; when trying to predictfuture interest rate trends, says Mr. Fine. &quot;Without knowingwhat Congress is going to do in terms of a fiscal stimulus,you don't know what future Fed action will be and where bondyields are likely to go.&quot;   Louis Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson andamp;Associates, also views Congressional wrangling over theeconomy as a potential problem for the bond market and forinterest rates.   When Congress returns in January, &quot;the bond market willhave to deal with a steady stream of headlines related tofiscal follies,&quot; Mr. Crandall says. &quot;Congress can be countedon to promise all kinds of things&quot; to show American votersthat legislators are trying to get the economy back on track,he says.   But Mr. Crandall believes that, in the end, such measures,if thought to be inflationary, will likely be defeated,leaving the door open for the Federal Reserve to control theeconomy through monetary policy.   By leaving a 1/2-percentage-point gap between the discountrate and the federal funds rate, &quot;the Fed has left themselvesroom to ease the federal funds rate further,&quot; Mr. Crandallsays. He believes, however, that the discount rate -- at 3.5%-- has probably reached a bottom.   Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp.,voices another reason why short-term interest rates might benear their bottom. He says that if short-term rates move anylower, they may fall below the inflation rate.   In fact, depending on which inflation measure is used,some short-term rates already have moved into negativeterritory when adjusted for inflation. Using a 12-monthchange in the core inflation rate of 4.5%, Mr. Robertsonnotes that &quot;real&quot;, or inflation adjusted, yields on federalfunds are now negative. That, he says, has always been a badsign for the bond market.   Of course, more recent inflation numbers are much lowerthan 4.5%, and some economists are predicting a 2% inflationrate for next year. Therefore, when using other measures,real yields remain positive.   Still, Mr. Robertson is far more worried about theprospect for the bond market than most other economists. &quot;Wehad a negative real federal funds rate in 1970, 1975 and in1980,&quot; he says. And in each case, &quot;the negative real federalfunds rate was followed by a period of accelerating inflationand a decline in bond prices.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Bond prices rose sharply as they rode the wave createdwhen the Federal Reserve made a big easing splash.   In a surprisingly aggressive move, the Fed cut thediscount rate one percentage point to 3.5% and reduced thefederal funds rate 1/2 percentage point to 4%.   Although the Fed had been expected to move at some pointin response to signs of economic deterioration, marketparticipants were surprised by the size of the discount ratereduction.   The bond market's benchmark security, the 30-year Treasurybond, ended at a price of 104 26/32, up nearly one point from103 29/32 on Thursday, for a gain of close to $10 for a bondwith a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves inthe opposite direction of its price, eased to 7.58%. That wasthe lowest closing yield on a benchmark 30-year bond sinceearly 1987.   The rate cuts prompted several issuers in the municipalbond market to sell debt to take advantage of lower rates. Inthe largest deal on Friday, South Carolina Public ServiceAuthority sold $350 million of revenue bonds via a MerrillLynch andamp; Co. group. The bonds were priced to yield from 5.35%for bonds that mature in 1997 to 6.70% for bonds that maturein 2031.   A group led by Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. priced $70 millionVirginia Beach Development Authority's hospital revenuebonds. The bonds were prices to yield from 3.90% for one-yearnotes to 6.65% for bonds that mature in 2021.   In trading, yields on some New York state notes plunged.Dealers quoted New York state tax and revenue anticipationnotes maturing in March at a 3.95% yield, down 0.45percentage point on the day from the 4.40% late Thursday.Yields on the New York state notes have declined about 0.85percentage point since Wednesday as holders of New York statenotes that mature on Dec. 30, 1991 begin to see reinvestmentopportunites.</TEXT></DOC>
