The pilot said the hijacker had held something under his jacketand threatened to blow up the plane. But, as the hijacker toldreporters before being led away, all he had was a piece of soap anda perfume spray bottle.   The pilot said he landed in Algiers after other airports inAlgeria and Tunisia refused permission to land there. It was notimmediately clear if the hijacker had demanded to be flown to thosedestinations.   The hijacker, who apparently surrendered, said he commandeeredthe plane to call attention ``to the need to end violence in Lebanonand Palestine.''   News reports in Paris said he was being expelled from France tohis homeland when he hijacked the Airbus A300.   An Air France spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity,said the hijacking ended at 3:25 p.m. (10:25 a.m. EDT), barely anhour after the plane landed at Houari Boumedienne airport east ofthe Algerian capital. She said the 102 passengers and 13 members ofthe crew were all safe. The spokeswoman said she could not givedetails of how the hijacking was ended.   Algerian police identified the hijacker as Said Djamel, aliasBendada, and said he was a 30-year-old merchant in Paris.   The French news agency Agence France-Presse, citing unidentifiedsources in Paris, said the man was being expelled for ``violatingpublic order'' and that he ``displayed great agitation'' beforebeing put on the flight to Algiers.   The plane's pilot, Joseph Valat, said in a brief statement thathe landed at Houari Boumedienne airport after airports in Tunis,Tunisia, and in Annaba and Constantine in Algeria refused permissionto land there.   The hijacker called for ``the holding of an internationalconference on Lebanon, the opening of a dialogue between the PLO andIsrael and the liberation of all hostages and prisoners in theregion.''   He showed reporters a small piece of soap and a perfume bottlewhich he identified as his only ``weapons.''   Initial reports from French air traffic control sources had saidthe flight of the Airbus from Paris to Algiers had been divertedtoward Tunisia.   Earlier incorrect reports had said that 130 and 123 people wereaboard.   Agence France-Presse said Air France Flight 2323, took off fromOrly airport in Paris.   The hijacking came amid heightened tensions between France andMoslem forces fighting in Lebanon. The Syrian forces and theirallied Moslem militias recently said they would shell Frenchwarships gathering in the eastern Mediterranean if they intervenedmilitarily in Lebanon.   France said the warships were dispatched to evacuate 7,000 Frenchnationals in Lebanon if the 5-month-old battle between Moslem andChristian forces worsens. But the Moslems accuse the French ofbacking the Christians.</TEXT></DOC>
