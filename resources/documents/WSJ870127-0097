The payments were made last year during Guinness's $3.8 billion takeover of Distillers Co. and its aftermath, and are at the center of the government's probe of a possible illegal share manipulation in the acquisition. Guinness says it is trying to find the precise identity of the recipients of five payments that account for more than half of the money in question; there were 11 payments altogether.    But the British brewer is getting some of the money back and is growing confident it will get more from parties already identified. Guinness officials say the company will accept an offer by Sandamp;W Berisford PLC to return $2.3 million, although Berisford has denied that the payment was for buying shares to support Guinness's bid.    One Guinness official said the company also expects to retrieve $387,858 paid to Zentralsparkasse andamp; Kommerzialbank of Vienna, Austria, and some of the $2.5 million paid to Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, Guinness's main financial adviser in the Distillers bid.    Last week, Heron International PLC, a closely held company controlled by British businessman Gerald Ronson, returned $8.9 million and acknowledged it bought Guinness shares to boost their price during the bid. A 25% jump in the price of the shares boosted the value of the bid and helped Guinness prevail over a rival bidder, Argyll Group PLC, which is now threatening legal action against Guinness.    Guinness sources say the company has written or contacted each of the 11 parties it has identified as receiving payments, seeking a &quot;satisfactory&quot; explanation of the fees -- and repayment if none can be given.    Zentralsparkasse spokesman Helmut Chwat said the bank acknowledged receiving a payment from Guinness. Mr. Chwat also said that the bank bought Guinness shares valued at about $2.8 million at the time of the Distillers bid, &quot;as a short-term investment,&quot; and that he &quot;assumes&quot; the shares were sold at a loss &quot;since we received this payment.&quot; The bank is conducting an internal investigation of the transactions, Mr. Chwat said.    Part of the British investigation focuses on whether Guinness, or anyone acting on its behalf, made promises of financial protection against market loss as inducements to buy the company's shares. Such indemnities could be illegal under British law.    Mr. Chwat said &quot;the bank is confident&quot; it violated no Austrian law, and that if it finds that British law was violated, it would return the money to Guinness.    Guinness sources say the company believes that Zentralsparkasse was originally approached about the share buying by Sir Jack Lyons, the former British adviser to Bain andamp; Co., a Boston consulting firm that helped advise Guinness on the takeover.    Still a mystery are the parties behind five invoices that Guinness received and paid under its old management. The names on the invoices, accounting for more than half of the $38 million, are CIFCO, Consultations andamp; Investissements, Konsultat S.A., Marketing andamp; Acquisitions Consultants Ltd. and Rudani Corp. Although Guinness earlier identified locations for these concerns, including Switzerland and various offshore tax havens, a company spokesman said that the information may have been in error, but declined to elaborate.    ---   Bank of England Inquiry   LONDON -- The Bank of England is investigating the quality of corporate-finance departments at British banks in the wake of the scandal surrounding Guinness PLC's acquisition last year of Distillers Co.    A spokesman said the British central bank has sent questionnaires to a number of merchant banks and other banks with big corporate clients in London's financial district. The central bank hopes to learn whether these banks' corporate-finance operations are conducted &quot;at the usual high standard,&quot; the spokesman added.    The inquiry represents a departure for the Bank of England in its role as supervisor of Britain's banking system. Until now, it has concentrated on supervising banks' deposit-taking role.    Last week, the bank applied informal pressure to secure high-level resignations at the merchant banks Morgan Grenfell Group PLC and Henry J. Ansbacher andamp; Co. in connection with the British government's investigation of Guinness's $3.8 billion acquisition of Distillers last April. The investigation focuses on a possible illegal manipulation to boost the price of Guinness shares during the bid. </TEXT></DOC>
