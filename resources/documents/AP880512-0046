Yeutter said American steelmakers will benefit from the gradualelimination of the two nations' tariffs because Canadian tariffs onimported steel are about double the U.S. average.   And he said they will also gain from the increased economicactivity the free trade agreement, or FTA, is expected to stimulatebetween the two countries.   ``To the degree that we have an expansion of economic activityand demand, the steel industry wins generally in both countries,''Yeutter said. ``In the absence of an FTA, that isn't going tohappen.''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Film Industry Wants More Controls on Cable TV `Monopoly'</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The president of the Motion PictureAssociation of America says cable television ``is no longer a babein swaddling clothes'' and Congress should rein in the industry'spower to control the entertainment marketplace.   ``Consumers are held hostage to their cable system,'' MPAAPresident Jack Valenti told a House subcommittee on Wednesday.``They have no alternative.

The Senate Energy and Resources Committee on Wednesday passed,over one senator's objection, a bill that would place a statue ofan Army nurse at the memorial   The lone dissenter, Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., protested whathe called a threat to the artistic integrity of the memorial. Astatue of three soldiers was added in 1984 by veterans groups whoobjected to the starkness of the granite wall, unveiled in 1982,that lists the names of American war dead.   The bill, which has 63 cosponsors, contained an amendment thatstrengthens a declaration that Congress would not allow any otherstatues to be placed at the memorial if the bronze sculpture of anArmy women's sculpture is approved.   ``This will be the last one,'' said Sen. Bennett Johnston,D-La., the committee chairman. ``But the last for how long?''retorted Evans, who stressed that his opposition had nothing to dowith his respect for American women.</TEXT></DOC>
