The move is part of new government efforts since the crushedspring pro-democracy protests to make youth both ``red,'' orpolitically sound, and expert in ominous echoes of the far leftistCultural Revolution.   The Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, said thatyouths still in school who create disturbances rather than studywill be expelled and could face criminal prosecution.   The newspaper directed a lengthy editorial at college students,many of whom are resuming class this month. ``Students from todaymust conscientiously study Marxist-Leninist-Mao Tse-tung thought(and) study the party's line,'' it said.   The new order affecting graduates for the past four yearsreflects deep government suspicion over the political reliability ofan entire generation of educated youth. Many young governmentworkers marched in the student-led protests for a freer society thatended with a bloody army attack on June 3-4.   Earlier this month, education officials denied reports that allrecent graduates were being sent out of the capital.   However, this week's Culture News, the Culture Ministry'snewspaper, said college graduates assigned to work in the ministryfirst must join in unspecified ``group study'' and then spend one totwo years receiving ``training'' in an enterprise under theministry's jurisdiction.   It said the graduates' residence permits will be switched fromBeijing to their new location, and that those who do not performwell will not be allowed to return to the ministry. China tries tolimit the population of its cities, and Beijing residence permitsare especially difficult to obtain.   ``Every office (of the ministry) ... must help these comrades toraise their political and professional quality,'' the paper said.   The Culture Ministry, contacted by telephone, confirmed thereport but said it did not know how many employees were affected,when they would leave for their new jobs or exactly where they wouldgo.   The Ministry of Broadcast, Film and Television and Academy ofSocial Sciences also confirmed such an order was issued but saidthey had not begun sending their recent graduates to new jobs. TheDefense Ministry and State Education Commission said they were notaccepting any new graduates this year.   Students who had planned to start graduate studies this Septemberalso must undergo what is called ``grassroots training,'' thegovernment announced recently. This usually means working in acounty town.   Some observers have likened it to the 1966-76 far leftistCultural Revolution, when virtually all of China's college andmiddle school students were sent to work on farm communes. Many werenever able to regain their city residence permits.   Now, however, the communes no longer exist, and there is noindication the youth will be put to work planting rice or feedingpigs.   Education officials said a 1983 regulation called for all collegegraduates to spend a year at the grassroots before joining centralgovernment offices, but it never was enforced.   Students said usually only the most politically active youthschose to work at the grassroots in hopes of gaining party membership.   Most Beijing college students return to class this month and faceseveral weeks of concentrated political study. The People's Dailyeditorial acknowledged continued campus unrest. ``The minds of thestudents are far from calm,'' it said. It said the political studyshould help them ``begin the school year with their minds at rest.''   It reiterated government pledges to punish only the ringleadersof the seven-week democracy movement.   Hundreds of students, professors and other intellectuals havebeen arrested since June 3-4, along with thousands of workers. Thepresident of Beijing University, whose students led the protests,was replaced Wednesday.   The government has stopped announcing most arrests, but theofficial radio in the southeastern province of Guangdong reportedtoday that five people were arrested there for plotting to smuggle awanted student leader from the country.   It said the five had entered China from Hong Kong but did notmake clear if they were Hong Kong residents. It said three of thefive were students and were released, while two remained in custody.The wanted student, Zheng Xuguang, was arrested in July, police saidweeks ago.</TEXT></DOC>
