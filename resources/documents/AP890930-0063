In Vietnam there is a fresh burst of optimism. The governmentsays its troops have finally ended a decade of fighting inCambodia, and people here believe they may be entering the firstperiod of peace in half a century.   In Cambodia, there is only more dying and a grim realizationthat the killing will probably intensify.   ``I'm happy that our troops have come home so no more of oursoldiers will die,'' said a sales clerk in a Vietnamese store.``But I'm worried there may be more unrest in Cambodia as aresult.''   Cambodians fear a standoff between the three guerrilla groupsand the forces of Prime Minister Hun Sen.   Cambodian officials say Phnom Penh residents are stockpilingfood because of worries that the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of theguerrilla groups, may cut supply lines to the capital as they didin 1975, when they encircled the city and overthrew theU.S.-supported government.   ``It's complex,'' said a Cambodian government technician inPhnom Penh whose older brother was killed by the Khmer Rouge. ``I'mglad we're taking responsibility for our own defense, but I'm alsonervous about what will happen.''   In the long run, however, Vietnam's military pullout fromCambodia could force a host of countries to re-evaluate theirpolicies toward Indochina and lift Hanoi and Phnom Penh out ofyears of diplomatic and economic isolation.   China and many Western nations cut ties with Vietnam after itinvaded Cambodia in late 1978 and removed the Khmer Rouge frompower. They refused to recognize the government Vietnam installedin Phnom Penh.   During its 3{-year rule, the Khmer Rouge murdered hundreds ofthousands of people in an attempt to ``cleanse the old society''and create a radical Communist state.   Evidence that all of Vietnam's troops have left Cambodia wouldboost the growing credibility of the Hun Sen government and removethe chief reason that China, Thailand and other nations give forsupporting the guerrilla coalition.   Vietnam insists its last 26,000 soldiers withdrew from Cambodiaon Tuesday, leaving only a few advisers, but Chinese and Thaiofficials charge that thousands of Vietnamese soldiers remain,disguised as settlers or Cambodian troops.   No internationally accepted group monitored the withdrawalbecause a conference in Paris last month failed to agree onarrangements for a team of observers.   Gen. Pat Akkaniput of Thailand's Supreme Command says there arewell-founded suspicions of a continuing Vietnamese militarypresence in Cambodia.   ``Let this game (of withdrawal) finish and then we will watch,''he said in a Bangkok interview.   Thailand's position is crucial for the future of the guerrillas,who are based along the Thai-Cambodian border and armed largely byChina. Thailand sees the Khmer Rouge as the main buffer betweenThailand and Vietnamese forces.   Pat said his nation will stop aiding the insurgents only afterthe Vietnamese withdrawal is verified, all outside military aid ishalted and a cease-fire is called. Until then, he said, Thai policyis to maintain military pressure on Phnom Penh while keepingcommunication open with Hun Sen open.   Some analysts disagree with Pat's charge that Vietnamese troopsremain in Camobodia.   They say Vietnam is staking its credibility and its futureeconomic growth on the claim of withrawal and that it is unlikelyVietnam would do otherwise.   ``I frankly don't think it would be possible to send troops backbecause the (Vietnamese) people would oppose it,'' said aVietnamese Foreign Ministry official who spoke on condition ofanonymity. ``Before, troops could be sent by orders from the top,but now too many people are against it.''   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Thursday, Vice President DanQuayle called for increased support for Prince Norodom Sihanouk andSon Sann, leaders of the two non-Communist factions in theguerrilla coalition, but declined comment on whether the UnitedStates had begun providing them with military assistance.   Earlier in the week, U.S. State Department officials said it wasstill too early to normalize relations with Vietnam.   Vietnamese leaders say supporters of the insurgents now shouldreduce their aid to the guerrillas.   ``We have created a favorable condition for a politicalsettlement by withdrawing from Cambodia,'' said Gen. Vo NguyenGiap, a key strategist during Vietnam's war with the United States.``Now other countries must stop their military support.''   Vietnam says the Khmer Rouge forces numbered 170,000 when itinvaded Cambodia in 1978. Now, it says, the three guerrilla groupsfield a total of 50,000 fighters, including 17,000 Khmer Rouge.   Western analysts estimate 30,000 to 40,000 Khmer Rouge arefacing 150,000 Cambodian government troops. The Khmer Rouge aregenerally regarded as far better trained and more experienced thanthe government troops. The guerrillas have little popular support,however.   Despite the resignation of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot from hislast official post in June, many believe he still holds power andthat the group has not changed its murderous ways.   Vietnam says 23,000 guerrillas have entered Cambodia from Thaibases in recent weeks to launch an offensive near the gem-miningregion of Pailin in western Cambodia.   Hun Sen has acknowledged the insurgents have captured someterritory in the area. Although heavy casualties have been reportedin the fighting, Hun Sen told reporters he did not see anypossibility of Pailin falling to the insurgents.</TEXT></DOC>
