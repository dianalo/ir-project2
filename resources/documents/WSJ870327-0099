Administration officials enjoy the Democrats' struggles to produce a plan. Proposed tax increases give Reagan an inviting political target. Serious compromise talks may not get going until both sides start to feel pressure from the May 15 deadline for passing a new debt-ceiling bill.    But a senior administration official privately says a deal is ultimately possible -- though by no means certain. A compromise package might cut the deficit by as much as $40 billion, with no income-tax rise but $10 billion or more in excise taxes. Medicare is a prime target for spending cuts; one proposal would save more than $4 billion by altering payments to hospitals.    The White House will demand pledges from top Democratic leaders -- not just the budget chairmen -- that any agreed-to numbers will stick.    ARMS AGREEMENT is still likely despite discord in missile talks.    While U.S. and Soviet negotiators trade accusations on the issue of short-range nuclear missiles, senior U.S. officials believe a pact eliminating medium-range missiles in Europe will come this year. &quot;It's inevitable that the Soviets will make a deal,&quot; says a State Department official. Shultz's visit to Moscow next month may help resolve the short-range issue.    The U.S. demand for the right to match Soviet deployments of short-range missiles is widely viewed as a bluff; such deployments would be politically impossible for West Germany. &quot;As a practical matter, it's a dead issue,&quot; a U.S. diplomat admits. But the Soviets hope that fanning the issue will revive the European left's campaign against the presence of U.S. nuclear arms.    REAGAN COURTS political clashes to re-energize his presidency.    Aides see veto fights as diverting attention from Iran and reasserting presidential leadership. Staff chief Baker tells aides that Reagan fought a highway-bill compromise so vigorously that &quot;you can see the bruises on my head and neck.&quot; Aides spread word of the president's stance in order to refute perceptions that he isn't really calling the shots. The next veto target may be the $11 billion supplemental spending bill.    Meanwhile, Baker slowly assembles a new staff. Rhett Dawson, executive director of the Tower Commission, may be in line for a top post. Baker said yesterday that he expects longtime aide Thomas Griscom, currently on loan to the White House from his job as president of Ogilvy andamp; Mather's Washington office, to stay permanently.    Griscom, though, laughs and tells reporters: &quot;Baker's not my spokesman.&quot;    TREASURY'S BAKER faces criticism over steps to brake the dollar's decline. Republican and Democratic lawmakers blast U.S. intervention as premature and say Baker should have pressed for more concessions. But Treasury says too steep a slide might cripple Japanese and German economies. Finance ministers will review the currency pact at a meeting next month.    ENERGY INSECURITY? Secretary Herrington, who rushed to take credit for the study of U.S. energy security prepared by deputy William Martin, instead is getting the blame. The report has been widely panned by environmentalists, oil men and congressional leaders. Many say Herrington spoiled its credibility by recommending an oil depletion allowance.    FAILING THE TEST? The General Accounting Office faults the Pentagon's new weapons-testing agency, set up after the Sgt. York gun debacle. The GAO says five recent reports by the independent agency were strikingly similar to -- in some cases almost verbatim copies of -- glowing reports done by the armed services themselves.    SHOOT TO KILL? House Majority Whip Coelho studies reports that an accredited free-lance news team was hired by Hill andamp; Knowlton to film congressmen on behalf of clients seeking to have a dam built in California. The edited footage was sent to TV stations in the district of Democratic Rep. Lehman, who opposes the dam.    GRAIN GLOOM may start to lift as overseas demand picks up.    Beset by bad weather, the Soviet Union has bought over two million metric tons of U.S. corn in recent weeks -- the first purchases in more than a year. Wheat interests grow increasingly optimistic the Soviets will also soon resume U.S. wheat purchases. Meanwhile, China will probably increase grain imports sharply, as rising production begins to lag behind soaring demand.    The expected improvement may strengthen Reagan administration efforts to avoid major changes in the farm law and fend off costly export subsidies. The administration will also argue that protectionist trade measures aren't needed, especially in agriculture.    A new, lower-cost offer of U.S. wheat to the Soviets now is &quot;a foregone conclusion,&quot; an industry official says.    MINOR MEMOS: The annual Hexagon Club comedy revue reports that Pat Robertson may choose Frank Perdue as his running mate so they can run on a wing and a prayer. . . . One of Reagan's Air Force Ones has to be repainted after a maintenance man sandblasts &quot;OK&quot; on the fuselage. . . . A dramatic flair? Justice Scalia regaled a Washington Opera dinner last month by reciting -- in German -- a scene about a lawyer from &quot;Die Fledermaus.&quot; . . . A new T-shirt urges, &quot;Make War, Not Love: It's Safer.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
