Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., asponsor of the legislation which established the program.   He spoke at a news conference organized by the CommerceDepartment to announce the choice of the three non-profit centers,from among 36 applicants. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity saidthere will be additional centers, but he was uncertain whether threeor five more will be sought in the next federal budget.   Congress has authorized 12 centers altogether, but provided moneyonly for the first three: $12 million for the year ending next Sept.30, to be matched by money from indidividual states and theinstitutions concerned.   The first centers will be at the University of South Carolina,the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and at theCleveland Advanced Manufacturing Program in Cleveland.   ``The centers will help smaller firms take advantage of some ofthe recent and dramatic advances in manufacturing technology,''Verity said.   The centers will inform firms in their areas about newtechnology, help them evaluate their needs, support training fortheir work forces and share their experiences with others.   Rensselaer will concentrate on businesses producing parts for theauto, consumer appliance and electronics industries. The SouthCarolina Technology Transfer Cooperative will concentrate on metalfabrication. The Cleveland group will deal largely withmanufacturing.   The program is being administered by the National Institute ofStandards and Technology, a new body succeeding the National Bureauof Standards and established by the trade law President Reagansigned last August.   In addition to setting standards for industry, the new instituteincludes a National Computer and Telecommunications Laboratory, aNational Engineering Laboratory that specializes in semiconductors,fiber optics and pipelines, and an Institute for Materials Scienceand Engineering.</TEXT></DOC>
