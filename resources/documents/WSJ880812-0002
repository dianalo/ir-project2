The semiconductor-technology skirmish was the first to break out publicly between Japan and South Korea, but others are expected. In the past, Japan often has been accused of illicitly using semiconductor technologies, mostly by U.S. chip makers. Now that Japan's technologies are worldclass, it finds itself in the unfamiliar position of fighting off mimickers. Whether future disputes can be settled along the lines of this pact remains to be seen.    Under the settlement, Samsung Semiconductor andamp; Telecommunications Co., South Korea's largest chip maker, agreed to pay for use of certain Hitachi chip-making technologies, a Hitachi official said. Hitachi, the world's third-largest chip maker, earlier this year said Samsung was illegally using the technologies to produce memory chips that the Korean company exports to the U.S.    The companies settled their dispute last week after several months of negotiations, the Hitachi official said. The settlement now awaits government approval in Japan and Korea, expected in early September. The pact &quot;should be no problem for our government,&quot; said a Samsung legal official in Seoul. &quot;The conditions are fair.&quot;    The technologies in question are Hitachi processes to make dynamic random-access memory chips, which are widely used to store information in computers and consumer-electronics products. A Hitachi official said Samsung had used illegitimate channels to obtain the technologies, on which Hitachi has patents in the U.S. and Japan.    The proposed contract calls for Samsung to pay an unspecified fee for the chips it has manufactured so far using the Hitachi process. Samsung also will pay royalties on future chips it makes with the process and sells, the Hitachi official said.    In addition, the contract includes a cross-licensing agreement between Hitachi and Samsung, under which the companies will have access to each other's semiconductor patents in exchange either for license fees or for other technologies.    &quot;We're not just settling this with money,&quot; said the Hitachi official. &quot;We want to keep friendly relations in the future . . . Korea will be developing its own technologies and in the future the flow may be reversed.&quot;    Last year, Samsung settled a similar conflict with Texas Instruments Inc., in which the U.S. company accused Samsung of infringing on Texas Instruments' patents for making memory chips. Eight Japanese companies also settled with the U.S. company last year. Texas Instruments now receives royalties from most of those firms. </TEXT></DOC>
