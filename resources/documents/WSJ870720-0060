SCI said Friday that it has been approached by several companies interested in acquiring the cable unit, which is the fourth-largest cable company with 1.4 million subscribers. SCI, which is 97%-owned by New York investment concern Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., circulated a memo to employees last week saying that it plans to sell the systems. SCI declined further comment.    Kohlberg bought Miami-based Storer Communications Inc. in a leveraged buyout two years ago and has since been selling its assets. SCI has concluded agreements to sell seven television stations. With a sale of Storer Cable, virtually all of Storer Communications' original holdings would have been sold.    According to industry executives, the asking price for the systems is between $2,200 and $2,500 per subscriber. &quot;It could be the biggest cable deal ever done,&quot; said John Waller, who heads Waller Capital Corp., an investment banking and brokerage concern specializing in cable TV.    Prices for cable TV systems have been spiraling upward lately, thanks to an increasingly favorable climate for the industry. Following the deregulation of the cable TV industry in January, companies raised subscriber fees, vastly improving their cash flow.    In recent months, cable systems have been selling for $1,800 to $2,000 per subscriber; last week, Boston-based Adams-Russell Co. was sold to Cablevision Systems Inc. for about $300 million, or the equivalent of $2,050 per subscriber.    SCI declined to identify the companies that had approached it. But industry executives said that they included Time Inc.'s American Television andamp; Communications unit, Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and the Bass brothers, who own interests in Taft Broadcasting Co. and Walt Disney Co.    A Time spokesman said the company is &quot;always interested in considering any attractive cable acquisitions,&quot; but declined to elaborate.    Tele-Communications, Comcast and the Bass family couldn't be reached for comment.    Because of the size of Storer Cable, two or more cable companies may team up to buy it, forming a group similar to that formed by five cable operators who purchased Group W Cable from Westinghouse Electric Corp. two years ago for $1.5 billion.    Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. are each said to be scrambling to put together such a group.    Storer is the largest of a half-dozen cable companies that are on the market at present. &quot;The consolidation process in the cable industry is moving forward at an ever greater speed,&quot; said J. Patrick Michaels, chairman of Communications Equity Associates Inc., a brokerage concern.    At present, the top 50 cable operators control about 85% of the subscribers, he said, noting that industry executives have been predicting that 25 cable companies will control 85% of the market by 1990. &quot;We're moving toward that more quickly than people thought,&quot; Mr. Michaels said.    Some in the industry wonder how long the upward spiral can continue, and question whether all the properties being sold are worth such high prices. &quot;I wouldn't want to be a buyer in this environment,&quot; says Mr. Michaels of Communications Equity. &quot;But every time I think the prices have to peak, they go higher.&quot;    Paul Kagan, who heads media investment concern Paul Kagan Associates, said in a recent newsletter that cable-system values &quot;are at peak levels&quot; at a time when &quot;interest rates are low and acquisition money is readily available.&quot;    Mr. Kagan thinks that as revenue and cash flow continue to increase, cable systems will be valued at between $2,400 and $2,800 per subscriber. &quot;A feeding frenzy has gripped the cable TV industry,&quot; he said. &quot;Buyers have simply hit the magic number that reels in the sellers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
