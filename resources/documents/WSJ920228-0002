It &quot;would be anextremely powerful company,&quot; said Peter Siris, an analystwith UBS Securities in New York.</LP><TEXT>   The two retailers, which disclosed their talks aftermarkets had closed, described the discussions as&quot;exploratory&quot; and said &quot;no agreement or understanding hasbeen reached to date.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Home Shopping closedat $8, down 12.5 cents a share. In over-the-counter trading,QVC closed at $19.50, up 50 cents a share.   A merger of Home Shopping and QVC would represent one ofthe last major consolidations in an industry that has seenmost of its players fall by the wayside. As recently as themid-1980s, as many as 60 retailers were plying their productson the airwaves, analysts estimate. But most were unable togenerate enough sales volume to cover the high costs ofstarting up a network. What's more, each retailer wasfighting for space on a limited number of cable channels.   Some companies were gobbled up by the industry giants.QVC, for instance, acquired CVN Cos., the nation'sthird-largest home shopping network, in 1989, and bought J.C.Penney's shopping channel last year. Most concerns, however,simply closed down.   &quot;Some entrepreneurs overestimated demand for the service,&quot;said Tom Adams of Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel, Calif.,consulting firm. &quot;Everybody thought that people would fallall over themselves to shop at home. But the fact is thatAmericans like to shop. That's why there's malls.&quot;   The two principal survivors, Home Shopping and QVC,account for the bulk of sales in the $2 billion industry.Home Shopping, based in St. Petersburg, Fla., reaches about35 million households through the 11 UHF stations it owns,and an additional 25 million cable subscribers, estimatesHarry Katica, an analyst with Raymond James andamp; Associates inSt. Petersburg. QVC, based in West Chester, Pa., is availableto about 42 million cable subscribers. The company is80%-owned by cable operators, including Tele-CommunicationsInc. and Comcast Corp.   A merger would play to the relative strengths of bothcompanies, analysts said. Home Shopping is known for itsadvanced telecommunications and technology, while QVC iscredited with having a more polished retailing style andinventory, according to Mr. Siris. QVC also markets to a moreupper middle-class audience, selling more apparel andbrand-name electronics, while Home Shopping has a lower-endappeal, pushing more jewelry, collectibles and giftware, saidBarbara Wedelstaedt at Duff andamp; Phelps Investment Research Co.in Chicago.   Analysts speculated that the networks might expand theirofferings rather than cut back their channels. Home Shoppingcurrently runs three networks, while QVC runs two. A combinedentity would be able to produce more segmented offerings,such as an apparel channel, analysts said. It would alsoprovide more programming for late-night on regular networkTV, said Ms. Wedelstaedt.   Home Shopping may also be exploring a combination tobolster its stock. The one-time high flier has reportedrelatively flat earnings in the past year, in part because ofa general downturn in retailing, said Ms. Wedelstaedt. Amerger might aid the company in paying down $200 million inlong-term debt from its ownership in the UHF stations.</TEXT></DOC>
