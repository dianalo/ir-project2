The rule received widespread support from accountants, industry and Wall Street. But some financial institutions and securities firms contend the data may distort the picture of their operations.    The cash-flow statement will be confined to receipts and disbursals of cash in operations, investments and financing. The statement is particularly important in the current economy as more companies go private, make acquisitions or restructure their operations, according to the FASB, the chief rule-making body for accountants.    Cash flow is one of the best measures of corporate liquidity and &quot;a good indicator of whether these transactions will succeed,&quot; says Diana Kahn, a project manager for the Stamford, Conn.-based FASB.    For banks and brokerage firms, however, &quot;such a cash-flow statement may not make sense,&quot; says Pat McConnell, associate director of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., a major securities firm. Ms. McConnell, an accountant, says the FASB's cash-flow approach understates the operating income and overemphasizes the expenses of banks and brokerages.    &quot;However, the rule will generally be a boon for financial analysts who want to know more about the current cash position of companies they cover,&quot; Ms. McConnell said.    Some big commercial lenders believe the cash flows required to be disclosed by the rule &quot;will be so large as to be meaningless,&quot; Ms. Kahn says. &quot;Cash is their product rather than just a sign of their liquidity.&quot;    The FASB rule forces many big corporations to issue statements based only on their cash transactions, which will likely raise their financial record-keeping costs. Many smaller companies have long been issuing cash-based financial statements.    The rule is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after next July 15.    The cash-flow statement will replace the statement on changes in financial position currently included in the annual financial statements of all public companies.
