The goal is to develop the critical technologyrequired for fuel efficient heavy duty transport engines. The strategyfor reaching this goal is to maximize industry involvement, emphasizetechnology development, rather than product design or demonstration,and concentrate on key technology barriers of a high-risk, long termnature. The program is primarily focused on those engines used in thetrucking industry. The approach is to develop the technology requiredfor the engine then demonstrate that technology by running proof-of-concepttests on components in test bed engines. The majority of the developmentis being conducted through R andamp; D contracts to industry. Emphasis is beingplaced on high temperature reciprocator components, high temperatureemissions and combustion, and effective exhaust heat utilization systems.Future plans call for a continuing effort in the above mentioned areasof technology with emphasis being placed on component development. Thepaper presents an overview of the program and those aspects of it thatinvolve coating development.</TEXT></DOC>
