Over the past few months, state attorneys general have been cracking down on advertising they consider misleading. California and Texas have been especially aggressive, with both focusing on airline advertising and demanding that advertised air fares include all charges, not just a base price. The states contend that low advertised prices are too often misleading because they don't add in all charges.    But yesterday, the Department of Transportation aimed a slap straight in the face of the state attorneys general. The DOT proposed amending its rules to specifically allow certain charges to be listed separately from the base ticket price. In a statement, DOT said the &quot;changes would reflect the Department's longstanding enforcement policy.&quot; And it said ads with separate charges wouldn't be &quot;unfair or deceptive. . . . The Department's experience indicates that these types of ads do not cause passengers harm.&quot;    Advertisers, naturally enough, welcomed the move. The attorneys general &quot;went way too far to protect the marketplace for consumers, and we're pleased that the DOT acknowledges that fact,&quot; said Daniel Jaffe, an executive vice president with the Association of National Advertisers, a trade group.    But the state attorneys general were quick to lash out at the proposal and they vowed to fight back. &quot;In this act, the DOT has in essence thrown down the gauntlet,&quot; fumed Steve Gardner, an assistant state attorney general for Texas.    Indeed, the DOT's proposal is just the latest salvo in an increasingly pitched battle between the federal government and the state attorneys general. The National Association of Attorneys General has proposed strict rules regulating rental-car advertising as well as airline ads. Advertisers, and increasingly the federal government, contend that the attorneys general have no right to regulate national advertising. They contend the attorneys general are usurping federal authority.    Advertisers also insist that if states are allowed to regulate advertising, a resulting patchwork of different rules in different states would make national ad campaigns impossible. &quot;If you want to have a national economy, then you have to have national regulation or you get economic chaos,&quot; contends Mr. Jaffe.    And in fact, the attorneys general have been reined in lately. A Texas court earlier this year temporarily banned the state attorney general from regulating airline advertising. What's more, Texas's Mr. Gardner says the attorneys general are feeling the heat from the food and automotive industries, both of which are also chafing at state attempts at regulation.    &quot;I was very hopeful that President Bush would herald a change in the attitude we saw in the Reagan administration,&quot; which favored a laissez-faire stance when it came to regulating advertising, Mr. Gardner says. But instead, the Bush administration is &quot;carrying on with business as usual . . . not giving a whit to the rights of consumers,&quot; he contends. He says he would file suit against the DOT if its proposal becomes a rule.    The attorneys general are especially infuriated because DOT made its proposal in response to a request for a ruling by the Air Transport Association -- an airline trade association whose members would benefit from the proposal.    The states' attempts to crack down on airline advertising included a complaint filed in March by California's attorney general. The complaint cited a Trans World Airlines advertisement promoting &quot;The Drop-everything fare: $219 London.&quot; Small print at the bottom of the ad made clear the round-trip purchase requirements and additional fees; given the restrictions, the attorney general said, the cheapest price for the package would actually be $461. A TWA spokesman says the ad &quot;is not deceptive,&quot; and adds that the ad clearly states the price is based on a round-trip purchase.    Such advertising, if the department's proposal is adopted, would apparently be fair play. &quot;The advertising of a fare that is not being sold is a deceptive practice,&quot; protests M. Howard Wayne, deputy attorney general in California. &quot;If the DOT has acquiesced in that, I don't believe they're acting in the interests of the consuming public.&quot;    ---   Hasbro Toy Accounts    Hasbro Inc. awarded the ad accounts for toy assignments -- worth $15 million to $20 million -- to ad agency Jordan, McGrath, Case andamp; Taylor, New York.    Jordan McGrath emerged the victor in two separate reviews, one for a girls' toy assignment and one for a number of board games in the firm's Milton Bradley Co. division. Executives indicated Jordan McGrath's track record with Tonka Corp., an account it serviced from 1982 until May of this year, was a credential that played in its favor.    Other agencies competing for the girls' toy assignment included Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, Boston, and D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp; Bowles, St. Louis. Scali, McCabe, Sloves, New York, a unit of WPP Group, was the only other contender for the Milton Bradley assignments.    The accounts were previously handled at Griffin Bacal, the New York shop that is Hasbro's only other agency, servicing more than $120 million of its ad business. A spokesman for Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro said the decision to hire Jordan McGrath wasn't a reflection on its principal agency, but simply that it wanted to add an agency to service its burgeoning games businesses.    ---   Ad Notes. . . .
