More than 50,000 government employees have walked off the job,demanding raises that President Vinicio Cerezo will not _ or daresnot _ grant them.   The strike has trapped Cerezo between the conservativeprivileged sectors and demands that have surged since democracy in1986.   His inauguration that year ended more than 30 years ofmilitary-dominated rule. But the campaign to replace him at the endof his five-year term is expected to bring an increase in theviolence that has been the curse of this Ohio-sized nation of 9million. By law, Cerezo cannot run again.   Affluent businessmen are reported doubling and triplingbodyguards in anticipation of kidnappings and other violenceleading up to the election, expected in the fall of next year.   Dozens of bombs or bomb scares have hit the capital since July19, when the president went on national television to defy thestrikers.   The president always packs a pistol.   ``After he puts on his tie, he puts on his gun,'' saidpresidential spokeswoman Claudia Arenas.   Cerezo, a man with a legendary social life whose government hasbeen described kindly as ``improvised'' or less kindly as``anarchic,'' has been firm in his ``no'' to demands for raises.   He insists that by raising salaries, the government, which hasone of the lowest tax bases in the hemisphere, would unleashcrippling inflation.   Cerezo has not forgotten what happened when he supported amodest tax hike early in his term. The business sector went onstrike and rightists waged what Defense Minister Hector Gramajolater called a ``large-scale'' pro-coup campaign.   Coup attempts came in May 1988 and on May 9 of this year.Gramajo is credited with thwarting both attempts by holding thebulk of the armed forces in line.   The teachers began walking out in early June. On July 13,thousands of strikers blockaded Congress during a ceremony honoringthe 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. The diplomaticcorps, the Cabinet and the Congress were trapped for hours.   Union leaders say teachers were promised a raise this year buthaven't received it despite rising prices. Two raises last yearbrought the starting salary to about $125 a month, with top scaleat $250 _ not bad by Guatemalan standards. The minimum wage is lessthan $60 a month.   Private sector unions, which earn less than the teachers,demonstrated in sympathy with government workers July 26.   ``If there is irresponsibility, if there is radicalization, ifthere is polarization, it could be risky,'' said Ms. Arenas.   The president insists the strike is pure politics and warned itcould backfire by costing ``democratic political parties'' thechance to replace him when he steps down Jan. 14, 1991.   ``You are being manipulated'' by the extreme right and theextreme left, he told strikers in a nationwide television and radioaddress July 19.   As the broadcast began, anonymous saboteurs bombed Channel 7'stransmission tower, knocking the private station off the air.   With all its failings, the Cerezo administration can and doesregard the survival of civil liberties outlined in the constitutionas its major achievement. That constitution, which came into forcein January 1986, gave public employees the right to strike.   ``Before, the strikers probably would have been shot,'' saidAngel Alfredo Figueroa, deputy attorney general for human rights.   In the fight for the nomination inside the majority ChristianDemocrats, Cerezo is backing party general secretary AlfonsoCabrera, a close friend.   The other leading contender is party patriarch Rene de Leon, whosupporters hope can clean up the party's corruption-tarnished image.   Twenty other political parties are registered.   The Cerezo administration denies rumors Cabrera is linked tonarcotics traffic, a major problem in Guatemala. U.S. officials saythey have no evidence Cabrera is tied to drug trafficking but wouldnot comment on other corruption charges.   Civilian government has helped Guatemala recover some of therespectability it lost in the bloodiest days of military repressionand it has helped preserve a measure of civil liberty, but ithasn't brought stability.   The military dominates the countryside where 70 percent ofGuatemalans live, most under conditions that have changed littlesince the Spanish Conquest.   The 27-year-old leftist insurgency continues in the remotemountains and jungles, even though the rebel force has dwindled tofewer than 2,000 fighters.   Cerezo clearly feels insecure.   In June, he retreated to the presidential farm for 10 days,emerging to describe an assassination plot involving an improbablecombination of Cubans, Libyans and rightists.   High walls topped by barbed wire protect the homes of thewealthy few who control the vast majority of Guatemala's resources.So-called ``civil defense'' patrols dispense rough justice amongthe rural, Indian poor.   The Mutual Support Group, a human rights organization, saidthere were about 800 political murders last year, and AmnestyInternational's latest report says the army and police continue torun death squads.</TEXT></DOC>
