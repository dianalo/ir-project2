The labor-force-participation rate for new mothers climbed to 50.8% last year from 49.8% in 1986, marking the first time a majority of women said they were working or actively seeking employment within a year of giving birth.    By comparison, 31% of new mothers were counted in the labor force in 1976, the first year the bureau calculated the rate.    Mr. O'Connell said the share of new mothers remaining in the work force has grown steadily over the last decade, a result of women's increasing propensity to delay marriage and childbearing in favor of jobs and education.    Women who accumulate more years of schooling and work experience before having children have &quot;greater financial resources to enable them, once they have a child, to obtain child-care services and get back to the labor force much quicker,&quot; Mr. O'Connell said. They have &quot;increased career commitment and increased cost of staying out of the labor force, compared to an 18 or 19 year old who had a child earlier&quot; in life, he said.    Mr. O'Connell pointed to findings that 68% of women who had their first child at age 30 or over remained in the job market, compared with 54% aged 18 to 24.    For new mothers with college degrees, the job rate was 63%, well above the 38% rate for those whose education ended during high school.    The new study, &quot;Fertility of American Women: June 1987,&quot; also disclosed a substantial increase in the number of two-earner families with children. It concentrated on women age 18 to 44, the normal child-bearing ages.    The increasing share of mothers returning to jobs led to a total of 13.4 million two-worker families with children last year, up from 8.3 million in 1976.    Childless couples with husband and wife employed and the wife of child-bearing age increased from three million to 4.3 million over the 11-year period.    &quot;A lot has been said about Dinks (dual-income, no-kids) . . . (and) given the attention, one would be led to think there are many more than there actually are,&quot; Mr. O'Connell said. &quot;The real story is the number of dual-employed couples where they have a child . . . that's the big news that's been happening the last 10 years.&quot;    At 13.4 million, dual-earner couples with children make up more than 40% of all married couples in the child-bearing ages, Mr. O'Connell said.    That, he added, means American businesses will have to pay close attention to the needs of these workers and families.    Other findings of the new Census Bureau study included:   --The national birth rate for the year ended June 1987 was 71 births for each 1,000 women age 18 to 44, up slightly from the rate of 70.3 for each 1,000 a year ago. The rate was 68.5 for white women, 83.2 for black women and 95.8 for Hispanic women. It was 95 for married women, 38.1 for single women and 23.5 for women who were widowed or divorced.    --Labor force participation among new mothers was 53% for blacks, 51% for whites and 36% for Hispanics.    --Widowed, divorced and separated mothers were most likely to be working, at 66%. Married women were second at 49.8%. Single mothers trailed at 49.5%. </TEXT></DOC>
