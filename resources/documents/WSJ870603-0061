Her 26 young researchers, several of them foreigners, enjoy a fat budget and the latest lab equipment in a spotless building nestled in a bamboo grove.    They never have to touch a drop of liquor. &quot;Application isn't our work,&quot; Ms. Naya says.    Instead, they do research on such topics as why certain fish are attracted to each other, on how barley roots extract iron from soil and on insects' sex lives. At the Suntory Institute for Bioorganic Research, Ms. Naya says, the projects &quot;aren't something that will pay off commercially.&quot;    The Suntory Ltd. lab represents the new gospel of creativity in corporate Japan. Japan feels it has caught up in applied research -- where researchers have a commercial product or process in mind -- and desperately wants to take a lead in pure science. Dozens of companies, from electronics giants to steelmakers to food companies, are staking millions of dollars to set up basic-research labs. The government, too, has pitched in with showy programs to encourage basic research.    The call to science stems not from curiosity about nature but from a deep and growing fear that Japanese industry will run out of steam without its own scientific &quot;seeds&quot; to feed future industries. Genya Chiba, a manager at the government's Research Development Corp. of Japan, says Japanese companies have mastered research aimed at creating commercial products, and now &quot;discover they are at the end of the road.&quot;    Government and industry leaders voice growing anxiety over where the ideas for Japan's next bonanza industries will come from. Not only is the West refusing to give away its best technologies as freely as before, they say, there are fewer of those technologies to draw from.    &quot;America has been our pacemaker,&quot; says Hisatoshi Goshima, an executive manager at Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp., or NTT, Japan's largest company. &quot;That pacemaker is harder and harder to see.&quot;    The solution: &quot;If we train more researchers and inject more money, we will decisively leapfrog into a top world position,&quot; says Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in his party newspaper. At the Venice summit next week, Mr. Nakasone will plug a multibillion-dollar Japanese biotechnology-research program.    But while prophets trumpet a new age of creativity in which Japan becomes the world's supplier of basic science, grave doubts remain that Japan can make the leap. The boom is a passing fad, skeptics say, doomed by risk-shy managers and economic factors such as the strong yen. And much basic research in Japan is stifled by a calcified bureaucracy, poorly equipped universities and a conservative education system that hampers free-thinkers.    &quot;There is still a major gap in the mentality between our researchers&quot; and those in the West, says Hisashi Shinto, president of NTT. The Japanese &quot;move on others' findings so that they won't make mistakes. They've fallen into a trap.&quot;    Research managers like Eiichi Maruyama want to change that. Mr. Maruyama oversees Hitachi Ltd.'s Advanced Research Laboratory, opened in 1985 in a wooded oasis outside Tokyo.    In a room full of tubes and beakers, a geneticist pores over thousands of tiny plants in glass vials. Down the hall, a researcher is developing a computer model of human thinking, a task he expects will take decades. Soon they and 80 others will move to a new seven billion-yen ($50 million) lab in a quiet suburb far from Hitachi headquarters. The lab doesn't take orders from product planners; researchers choose their own themes. &quot;We want to value the individual researcher's personality to let him be creative,&quot; says Mr. Maruyama.    Until now, Japan dismissed basic research as too risky and too expensive. For every promising scientific discovery, thousands more don't make it out of the lab. But Western industrialists say Japan has come too far on borrowed science. &quot;Japan isn't performing its fair share of the basic, scientific research which adds to the world's store of knowledge,&quot; says William C. Norris, chairman-emeritus of Control Data Corp.    Hitachi's Mr. Maruyama agrees. &quot;Now we're rich, and we have to take the responsibility of being rich,&quot; he says. &quot;That means not simply making products but contributing to science. We have to take on the risks of investing in research that has uncertain results.&quot;    That mood has been growing since the early 1980s, when creativity became a catchword among Japanese opinion leaders. NEC Corp. has set up a basic-research lab where newly hired scientists study, among other things, the nervous system of microscopic worms. Toshiba Corp. plans to boost basic-research spending to 20% of its research budget within five years, up from 10% now and nearly zero in 1983.    Kobe Steel Ltd. has a new biotechnology lab. Toyota Motor Corp. does biomedical studies at its research subsidiary. Ajinomoto Co., a food-products company, opened a basic research lab in February. By one estimate, more than 30 major companies have set up basic-research labs in the past five years.    A recent survey indicates that corporate research expenditures in the life sciences jumped 16% to 429 billion yen ($3.05 billion) in 1985, the largest rise in the survey's history. And manufacturers are starting to woo more theorists. One-fourth of the doctoral-degree graduates in theoretical physics at the University of Tokyo between 1981 and 1985 took posts in corporate labs. &quot;In 1970, no one would touch them,&quot; says Steve Yamamoto, a physics professor at the university.    Government bureaucrats have eagerly joined the fray. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, started promoting basic research in 1984. The education ministry boasts a new high-energy particle accelerator. The science agency gives $10 million grants to senior researchers.    Then there is Mr. Nakasone's pet project, the Human Frontiers Science Program. The plan is to bring together the world's scientists to unlock the secrets of biology -- to determine how organisms convert energy into motion, for example, or the mechanisms behind such mental functions as creativity, memory and recognition. MITI officials have spent the past year garnering international support for the program, which, by an early MITI estimate, will cost one trillion yen over 20 years.    Japan is indebted to the West, says Mr. Nakasone. &quot;We now need to repay the favor.&quot;    But Japanese companies still must tap the West for research talent. Some, like Ohtsuka Pharmaceutical Co., have opened research institutes in the U.S. Others give huge grants to U.S. universities to tap into their research.    Still others import Western-educated scientists. A law passed last year lets government labs hire foreigners. Hitachi plans to hire foreign scientists for 20% of the 250 posts its lab will have by 1990.    When Suntory's managing director, Teruhisa Noguchi, shifted the Suntory bioorganic lab from liquor-related research in 1979, he hired as the lab's manager Koji Nakanishi, a professor at New York's Columbia University. Eight foreign researchers now work there. To staff a new biomedical lab next door, Mr. Noguchi pulled 10 researchers from overseas labs. </TEXT></DOC>
