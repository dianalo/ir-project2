Projections obviously vary with assumptions about how longthe fighting will last, how soon it becomes a ground war andthe level of intensity. But the final tab when the fightingends also will depend heavily on how much destroyed militaryequipment needs to be replaced, particularly at a time whenthe U.S. military is supposed to be slimming down. If, forinstance, the Pentagon doesn't replace such big-ticket itemsas F-15 jet fighters, which cost about $50 million each, thefinal cost of the Mideast war could be lowered considerably.</LP><TEXT>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan estimated the costof the air war at &quot;several hundred million&quot; dollars a day but&quot;probably under half a billion a day.&quot; He told the HouseBudget Committee that the financial costs &quot;may be a lot lowerthan we realize&quot; and warned Congress against rushing toimpose a war tax.   House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said currently&quot;there are no plans&quot; for tax increases.   The administration isn't offering its own war-costestimate, despite congressional prodding. &quot;The only peoplewho haven't put an estimate out there are the only people whoreally know,&quot; complains Gordon Adams, director of the DefenseBudget Project, a private, non-profit group.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a war thatlasted about one month could cost $17 billion, but the figurecould double for a longer conflict. The per-day cost woulddecline, however, because a longer war most likely wouldbring periods of intensive warfare followed by some relativelulls. The CBO study adds that if all major weapons andammunition were replaced, which isn't likely, the total warcost ultimately could soar to between $28 billion and $86billion.   During the early, intensive air war, most of the costswould be for computer-guided &quot;smart&quot; weapons, such as theTomahawk missile, according to the CBO. In the first fivedays of the conflict the U.S. launched about 225 Tomahawks,at a total cost of about $300 million.   In addition, the costs of fuel, repairs and other itemsfor U.S. aircraft are expected to total about $10 milliondaily, analysts say.   The private Defense Budget Project pegs the cost of thewar at $40 billion to $50 billion for a conflict lasting aslong as six months. Mr. Adams says that in the initial phaseof a combined air and land war, daily costs would be $1billion but would probably drop by half after the firstmonth.   One major cost would be ammunition and missiles. Duringthe Reagan administration's military buildup, sizable stocksof munitions were stored in Europe. These inventories are nowbeing drawn down, and, Mr. Adams says, production to replacethem has begun. He also estimates that the U.S. has 3,000 to4,000 smart missiles in inventory, and production of more ofthese weapons also is under way.   The initial costs during the first week of the air warhave been unexpectedly light. But a ground war, which wouldbe Saddam Hussein's strength, would involve heavy materielcosts. Mr. Adams said that in such a war the U.S. could take&quot;extensive losses&quot; of Apache helicopters, which cost about$11 million each. Other equipment losses that probably wouldrequire replacement, Mr. Adams says, would include M-1 andM-1A tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicle troop carriers.   The Center for Defense Information, a longtime Pentagoncritic, believes that a war of as long as six months wouldcost $50 billion to $80 billion. Its calculation is based onsuch major items as munitions, troop costs and transportationcosts, which, it says will average about $500 million a day.   The total cost wouldn't include replacing most lostaircraft. Retired Adm. Gene La Rocque, the group's director,notes that the size of the U.S. military is supposed to bedecreased as a result of the end of the Cold War. But, withthe onset of war in the Mideast, he adds: &quot;The enthusiasm isgrowing for more of this high-tech stuff.&quot;   That enthusiasm to replace equipment could be tempered byother factors, however. One defense analyst notes, forexample, that the U.S. Air Force is hoping to add a newadvance tactical fighter to its inventory by 1997. Limited bybudget austerity, the Air Force might have to wait for thenew fighter, rather than replace any lost F-15s.   Similarly, the analyst says, the Navy might decide not toreplace any lost A-6 medium-range bombers. The aircraft hadbeen scheduled to be replaced by a new bomber, but theproject was canceled by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Afterthe war, the Navy could reopen the argument for the newairplane, rather than push to replace its losses.   But even if the administration follows through on its planto reduce the overall size of U.S. military forces, LawrenceKorb, a senior Pentagon official in the Reaganadministration, estimates it still would need to spend anaverage of $200 million a day just to replace the equipmentit will need in the post-Cold War world.   ---   David Wessel contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
