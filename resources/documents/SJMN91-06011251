But when they broke off and formed their ownblues band, Hot Tuna, those techniques rarely seemed more than adequate. Withthe Airplane's pitiable reunion tour/album now behind them, Kaukonen, Casadyand a new and competent band emerge with &quot;Pair A Dice Found.&quot; While it'squestionable whether the world needs a breezy update of Barry McGuire's &quot;Eveof Destruction,&quot; Hot Tuna's lighter, more mass-appeal touch essentiallysucceeds. There's only a smattering of real blues here, including &quot;AK47,&quot; aChicago-style cooker penned by guitarist Michael Falzarano, but there's stillplenty of the bluesy spiritual disarray. Seething just beneath the surface ofpop-powered tracks such as &quot;Shot in the Act,&quot; &quot;Flying in the Face of Mr. Blue&quot;and &quot;Ken Takes a Lude&quot; is some of the surest blues ever produced by Hot Tuna.;   Fresh but meaningless  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HOT TUNA'S COOKIN'  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Pop, Jazz Record Reviews  </MEMO><TEXT>   SOHO: &quot;Goddess&quot; (Atco) (star)(star)(star) -- During the better stretches of&quot;Goddess,&quot; the vivacious debut album from the British trio Soho, twinsJacqueline and Pauline Cuff wail like jubilant banshees. Their voices, flyingin close harmonic formation on fresh, remarkably unabashed tracks such as&quot;Love Generation,&quot; &quot;Hippychick&quot; and &quot;Nothin' on My Mind,&quot; seem to wingeffortlessly through the bright rivulets of funk and psychedelic pop laid downby guitarist-songwriter Timothy Brinkhurst. Save for some brick-thick reggaeon &quot;Shake Your Thing,&quot; it's all as empty as a $2 sieve. But what &quot;Goddess&quot;lacks in meaning it makes up for in mood.;    A master's smart charts; THE MELLEWIS JAZZ ORCHESTRA: &quot;The Definitive Thad Jones; Vol. 2 Live From the VillageVanguard&quot; (Musicmasters) (star)(star) (star) 1/2 -- This is the last recordingsession the Mel Lewis band made before Lewis' death in February 1990, and itbears the marks of the master: smart charts over a shimmering sound, based onthe ride cymbal, that pulses with tasteful force. Lewis was one of the greats,and his resurrection of charts by his longtime collaborator, Thad Jones, is agood move.;    There are great solos -- tenorist Joe Lovano lights up &quot;CherryJuice&quot; -- and there's a playfulness not always seen in bands of this stature.;   Tin pickings;  THE DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET: &quot;New Wine&quot; (Musicmasters) (star)1/2 -- The crowning embarrassment of this CD is the Montreal InternationalJazz Festival Orchestra. This leaden crew makes you yearn for music thatdoesn't conjure up ice-skating. At its best, Brubeck's orchestral music soundslike a knockoff of Leonard Bernstein. The title track has a pseudo-Spanishfeeling that would be overdoing it even for a Chrysler Cordoba commercial.Brubeck does get down to some playing on &quot;Blue Rondo a la Turk,&quot; but heavypounding mars his solo, and, to top it off, the recording is tinny and thin.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910111  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  13E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  476  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, January 11, 199100011251,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
