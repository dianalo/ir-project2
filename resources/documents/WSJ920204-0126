If eligibility were extendedto allow participation by former heads of government in othercountries, Mr. Nixon's book still would be a good bet, butentries by Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Schmidt and YasuhiroNakasone would make the contest closer and more interesting.   &quot;Seize the Moment&quot; is a &quot;tour d'horizon&quot; of global scopethat addresses the challenges a changing world poses for U.S.interests and policies. It also presents a challenge to anauthor who aspires to describe it and prescribe policies thatthe &quot;one superpower&quot; should follow -- a challenge that Mr.Nixon meets confidently and competently. Even so, the book'scoverage is uneven -- generally better in sketching the bigpicture than the fine-grained details.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Nixon's ninth book begins with an overview chapter on&quot;The Real World&quot; -- a title presumably intended as a contrastto the mythological world inhabited by many foreign-policycommentators. He takes careful aim at &quot;three myths that{have} dominated the debate about the future of U.S. foreignpolicy.&quot;   The first is the &quot;myth of the end of history.&quot; In contrastto Frank Fukuyama, who has propounded this Hegelian notion,Mr. Nixon thinks it is quite premature to proclaim &quot;thetriumph of . . . liberal democracy and market economics.&quot; Thesecond is the &quot;myth of the irrelevance of military power.&quot;Those &quot;who propound the irrelevance of military power vastlyoverstate the influence of economic power,&quot; he argues. Andthe third is the &quot;myth of the decline of America.&quot; In fact,writes Mr. Nixon, the U.S. is &quot;the only country thatpossesses global economic, military and political power.&quot;   The second and longest chapter deals with &quot;The Former EvilEmpire,&quot; a subject to which Mr. Nixon brings insight as wellas experience. His evaluations of Mikhail Gorbachev (&quot;aSoviet version of Adlai Stevenson&quot;) and Boris Yeltsin (&quot;acombination of John Wayne and Lyndon Johnson&quot;) are acute,especially so since they were made months before Mr.Gorbachev's resignation. He argues in favor of direct ties tothe republics, strong support for Mr. Yeltsin's efforts atcomprehensive systemic economic reform, and against MarshallPlan-type financial assistance. &quot;The greatest contributionthe United States could make is not financial, butideological.&quot;   Advocates of &quot;democratic socialism&quot; -- whether in theformer Soviet Union or in the West -- are a frequent targetof severe criticism. Mr. Nixon probably underestimates therising tide of protectionism in the European Community, butmakes a novel suggestion for how the U.S. might circumventthis trend. He proposes a two-step process in which the ECgrants associate-member status to the East Europeancountries, while the U.S. forges &quot;a close economicrelationship&quot; with them that could &quot;give the United States apotential back door into an increasingly protectionistpost-1992 Europe.&quot;   Turning to Japan and China, Mr. Nixon steps into familiarterritory. He is neither a &quot;basher&quot; nor an apologist forJapanese mercantilism, though he would accept, if &quot;only as alast resort . . . selective retaliation if the Japaneserefuse to abandon clear and identifiable unfair tradepractices.&quot; While favoring increased U.S. economic&quot;engagement&quot; with China, he proposes opening up two newbroadcast stations, Radio Free China and Radio Free Tibet, toprovide independent information and commentary. In his view,it behooves the U.S. to penalize China for its sales ofnuclear technology and missiles, and to enhance Taiwan'spolitical standing.   Turning to &quot;The Southern Hemisphere,&quot; Mr. Nixon argues formeasured U.S. concern and involvement for moral, economic andsecurity reasons. He excoriates the statist propensities of&quot;Western academics,&quot; and strongly and unsurprisingly endorsesfree markets, investment in human capital, limited governmenttax burdens, foreign investment and export-led growth as thepolicy directions that the U.S. should encourage in thedeveloping world.   When it comes to domestic policies, Mr. Nixon surveys thecountry's problems -- savings, investment, education, crime,drugs, the homeless -- in a discussion that is longer onrhetoric than it is on solutions. It is not sufficient toassert that &quot;birthright entitlements {are} corroding Americansociety&quot; and that further solutions lie in the realm of&quot;values, attitudes and behavior,&quot; which are not dependent ondollars.   Although for the most part his broadbrush treatment issound and well-informed, Mr. Nixon's literary style is attimes cloyingly didactic and categoric. Besides the &quot;threemyths,&quot; there are &quot;three dangers&quot; that &quot;could make thevictory of freedom short-lived,&quot; &quot;three fundamental errors,&quot;&quot;four fundamental geopolitical facts,&quot; &quot;three fatalillusions&quot; and &quot;five basic rules&quot; for U.S. policy in theArab-Israeli dispute]   Still, even if this book is at times as much a sermon as aprofound analysis, Mr. Nixon has the fundamentals right. Hisgenerally upbeat attitude toward America's opportunities andcapabilities provides a refreshing contrast to the negativismthat abounds among pundits of the domestic- andforeign-policy establishment.   ---   Mr. Wolf is dean of the RAND Graduate School and directorof economic research at RAND's National Defense ResearchInstitute.</TEXT></DOC>
