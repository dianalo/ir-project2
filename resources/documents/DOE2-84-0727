<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-84-0727 </DOCNO><TEXT>In support of advanced propulsion engine development, an experimentalstudy of several gas turbine combustor liner cooling concepts was conductedin a heat-transfer rig. The test rig was capable of simulating advancedturbine engine operating conditions. An AGEMA Model 782 SWB scanner anddigital image processing system (DIPS) were employed to acquire hot-surfacetemperature distributions on the candidate liner cooling samples. Thesubject surfaces were successfully imaged through a high-velocity flowof luminous combustion products at gas temperatures approaching 2600F.Due to the nonintrusive nature of the instrument, measurements were obtainedwithout disturbing relevant gas flows or thermal properties of the material.Thermal images recorded on video tape were posttest-processed with theDIPS software to obtain detailed thermal performance data for each conceptstudied.</TEXT></DOC>
