The proposal is a move to save the Sun, which is losing about $3million a year, has a debt of $10.7 million and has not beenprofitable since 1981, according to the proposal for a jointoperating agreement.   The Sun's founder and feisty editor, Hank Greenspun, who diedJuly 22, for years sought a JOA with the more powerfulReview-Journal. An agreement was signed by the two papers July 12,and the plan was announced onday.   If approved by the U.S. Justice Department, the plan will makeLas Vegas at least the 19th U.S. city to have a JOA.   The agreement calls for both newspapers to maintain separatenewsrooms and separate weekday editions. The Review-Journal wouldremain a morning paper and the Sun would become an afternoonpublication, but combined morning editions, labeled the Las VegasReview-Journal-Sun, would be published on Saturdays, Sundays andholidays.   ``Without this move we believe the Sun is in probable danger offinancial failure,'' Sun President Brian Greenspun said in astatement. ``With this move, there will be no displacement of Sunnewsroom personnel and there will be the continuation of animportant newspaper.''   The Review-Journal is Nevada's largest newspaper and theflagship for Donrey Media Group, which owns 59 U.S. daily papers.The Sun is the state's third-largest paper.   Like many papers in a city with a dominant competitor, the Sunhas been losing circulation. It dropped 8 percent daily and 11percent Sunday between 1980 and 1988, while the Review-Journal'scirculation increased 50 percent daily and 60 percent on Sunday.   The Review-Journal's daily circulation at the end of 1988 was121,321 compared with 50,515 for the Sun. Sunday circulation was142,923 for the Review-Journal, 54,669 for the Sun.   Under the JOA, the Sun would receive 10 percent of the operatingprofits of the two newspapers and the Review-Journal would receive90 percent, based on its stronger financial position.   The Sun will give Donrey Media Group 10 percent of theoutstanding stock in Community Cable TV worth an estimated $20million and an option to purchase an additional 35 percent of thestock.</TEXT></DOC>
