(WGM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of TransCanada PipeLines, Ltd. (TransCanada).The applicant had requested that DOE hold its original August 1988 filing(53 FR 39760, October 12, 1988) in abeyance pending governmental approval.WGM had been unable to secure the requisite producer support for the saleof the gas. Southeastern indicates in its amended application that thepricing and other terms of the import arrangement, as modified, have receivedthe necessary producer support, and requests that DOE reactivate the applicationand consider it as amended.TransCanada would deliver the gas to a point at the international bordernear Emerson, Manitoba, where TransCanada's facilities connect with thoseof Great Lakes Gas Transmission Company (Great Lakes) and Midwestern GasTransmission Company. Great Lakes has filed a related application withthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC Docket No. CP88-541-000)for authority to transport the gas to Southeastern via an existing interconnectionbetween Southeastern and ANR Pipeline Company (ANR). As part of its FERCapplication, Great Lakes requests authority to construct certain necessaryfacilities, including a 2.9-mile loop of 36-inch diameter pipe. Southeasternindicates ANR may also be involved in transporting some of the gas to anexisting interconnection of their two systems. The proposed gas purchase contract renegotiated by Southeastern and WGMprovides for the sale and purchase of a daily contract quantity of 15,000Mcf, up to a term total of 82,125 MMcf, with deliveries to commence afterregulatory approval and to continue for a term ending 15 years after gasfirst flows. Southeastern also may buy gas in excess of the daily contractquantity on an interruptible, best-efforts basis, subject to availabletransportation. The annual contract quantity (sum of the daily contractquantity) is subject to a 50 percent minimum purchase requirement (``annualtriggering volume'') in the first three contract years and 70 percent thereafter.If Southeastern does not take the annual triggering volume in any year,the contract provides for a gas inventory charge of 10 cents per Mcf ofthe shortfall. The contract also permits WGM to reduce the daily contractvolume to reflect a shortfall. Southeastern would purchase gas under the proposed contract in accordancewith a two-part, demand-commodity rate structure. The demand charge wouldbe determined monthly based on the firm transportation charges of TransCanadaand the NOVA Corporation of Alberta (NOVA). The method for calculatingthe NOVA component of the demand charge rate is subject to limited renegotiation.The commodity component, as modified, is based on a formula indexed tothe price paid by Southeastern under current long-term contracts for thepurchase and sale of gas on a firm basis from alternative suppliers deliveredthrough the pipeline systems of ANR or Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company.The commodity charge is subject to annual renegotiation at the requestof either party, and in the absence of agreement, arbitration. In an October10, 1989, letter Southeastern indicated that under the pricing formulathe delivered charge for September 1989 would be $1.63 per MMBtu. Thisprice is the total of a $0.2575 demand charge and a $1.3725 commodity charge.The price for excess gas is the effective commodity charge under the gaspurchase contract, plus the interruptible transportation charges of TransCanada.Gas supplies committed to the import arrangement under the proposed contractwould come from the pool of supplies dedicated by Canadian producers toTransCanada. WGM and TransCanada must use reasonable efforts to add gasreserves necessary to maintain a ten-year reserve-production ratio and,according to the application, may not enter into gas contracts in any yearin which that ratio is less than ten, or which would reduce the ratio toless than ten. The decision on this application will be made consistent with the DOE'sgas import policy guidelines, under which the competitiveness of an importarrangement in the markets served is the primary consideration in determiningwhether it is in the public interest (49 FR 6684, February 22, 1984). Partiesthat may oppose this application should comment in their response on theissue of competitiveness as set forth in the policy guidelines. The applicantasserts that this import arrangement is competitive. Parties opposing thearrangement bear the burden of overcoming this assertion. <ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance </ITAG>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires the DOE to give appropriate consideration tothe environmental effects of its proposed actions. The FERC has performedan environmental review of the impacts of constructing and operating theproposed facilities related to this project. The DOE will independentlyreview the results of the FERC environmental evaluation of this projectin the course of making its own environmental determination. No final decisionwill be issued in this proceeding until the DOE has met its NEPA responsibilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures </ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable and written comments.
