Taylor became a target among unhappy parentslast year during a series of one-day teacher strikes and the prolonged labornegotiations.;    &quot;Ann Taylor was the messenger last year during the strikes,&quot;Howard told the board, as she broke into tears. &quot;She didn't cause the strikes,all she did was report about it. You don't kill the messenger.&quot; People in theaudience pulled out handkerchiefs and daubed at tears as she spoke.;   Parents and some employees supported the idea of a wage freeze instead oflaying off workers. As of Thursday night, about 10 clerical and fiveadministrative jobs had been eliminated from the budget.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RENEE KOURY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910510  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  534  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 10, 199100131103,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
