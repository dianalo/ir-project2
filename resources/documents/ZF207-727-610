Fuller, a CompuServe productmanager.andM;The COLLECT command can create a more efficient database design by spreadingdata volumes across disks for maximum I/O performance, officials said.andM;Data sets can now also be joined through the multiattribute Join utility,which can combine attribute values into a composite value.andP;  This utility letsusers create more sophisticated reports and applications, officials said.andM;In addition, the latest version of System 1032 has a global section of memoryfor large and widely used procedures that do not have to be stored on disk.andO;The shared procedures result in increased procedure execution speed.andM;System 1032 also has improved security in the form of VMS Identifier Support,which allows access only to holders of general VAX/VMS identifiers, accordingto officials.andM;The software uses existing security groupings that control VMS file accessand provides access control for actions performed on variables.andM;CompuServe officials said System 1032 differs from traditionaldecision-support RDBMSes in that it is aimed at industrial and scientificapplications rather than online transaction processing.andP;  System 1032 supportsmore than 2 billion records per data set, more than 65,000 characters perfield and more than 30,000 fields per record, they said.andM;They added that in the future they plan to add create links, allowing System1032 users to integrate RMS and Rdb files, add support for SQL as aconnectivity language to other applications, and adopt a client/serverarchitecture.andM;Available in December, System 1032, version 8 will range in price from $3,000for a VAXstation to $180,000 for a VAX 8840, according to officials.andM;For additional information, CompuServe Data Technologies, a division ofCompuServe Inc., can be contacted at 1000 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA02138, (617) 661-9440.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
