Now it appears neither of them will see the big payoutsthey were promised. In fact, they may be lucky to get all oftheir original investment back. Last month, insuranceregulators took control of the California and New York unitsof First Executive Corp., which issued the annuities, afterheavy losses on its huge junk-bond portfolio. &quot;It's scary,&quot;says Mrs. Szostak. &quot;You don't know where to put your moneyanymore.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   What the Szostaks painfully discovered is that insurancepolicyholders and annuity investors in many cases have lessprotection than depositors at banks, thrift institutions andcredit unions. If a bank goes bust, there is depositinsurance of $100,000 per person and sometimes more. In thelife-insurance industry, there is no nationwide protectionfund. And protection offered by so-called state guarantyfunds ranges all over the lot.   The present value of the Szostaks' investment would becovered up to $500,000 by the state guaranty fund if theylived in New York. If they lived in Connecticut, the fundthere would cover them up to $100,000. But they would face nolimit at all if they lived in Maryland, where the state fundcovers all obligations of insolvent insurers.   Unfortunately, however, they live in New Jersey -- and forresidents of New Jersey, Louisiana and the District ofColumbia, who together own about $2.1 billion of FirstExecutive life insurance and annuities, there is no localguaranty fund to cover insolvencies of life-insurancecompanies.   What's worse, even where there are state guaranty funds,many couldn't stand up under the insolvency of a majorinsurer. &quot;You'd find some states where the capacity would betapped out quickly,&quot; says Joseph Belth, an insuranceprofessor at Indiana University.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, who has held hearings onthe adequacy of the state regulatory system for insurance,says: &quot;The bottom line is that it's unrealistic to thinkthere is enough money there to cover losses.&quot; According to astudy for a subcommittee he heads, the funds in Hawaii,California, Texas, Nevada and Florida could be depleted bythe First Executive problems if losses top $1.2 billion,which is possible.   Insurance regulation and the lack of completeguaranty-fund coverage have become hot topics in Washingtonin the wake of the failure of First Executive's two operatingunits and those of another Los Angeles insurance holdingcompany, First Capital Holdings Corp. Those collapses alonehave resulted in regulatory actions against six operatingunits in several states with nearly $25 billion in assets.First Executive Corp., the holding company, has filed forprotection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcycode.   Despite those failures, Congress is not consideringsetting up a federal plan to protect insurance policyholders,for fear it might lead to a federal bailout akin to thesavings and loan crisis. Lawmakers, led by Rep. John Dingell,a Michigan Democrat, are calling, however, for some federaloversight of the industry that would impose stricteroperating standards.   There is still some chance that the problems of FirstExecutive and First Capital won't put the insurance-guarantyfund system to a severe test. Potential rescuers as diverseas Altus Finance, an affiliate of French bank CreditLyonnais, and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. of New Yorkhave expressed interest in First Executive's operating units.And the California insurance commissioner is pressuringAmerican Express Co., which owns 28% of First Capital, to aidits troubled affiliate. There is also the possibility of abroad-based insurance-industry bailout similar to the onethat aided policyholders of Baldwin-United Corp., whichcollapsed in 1983.   What's more, the insurance industry says the currentsystem is well-equipped to handle an insolvency. &quot;The systemis one that we have confidence in,&quot; says a spokesman for theAmerican Council of Life Insurance. &quot;We're sure a solutionwill be found that does not leave people owed money they'vebeen promised.&quot;   Even so, the problems of First Executive and First Capitalhave raised questions about a guaranty fund system that manycritics charge is outdated and inadequate to cope with therapidly increasing number and size of insurance insolvencies.Richard Stewart, a consultant and former New York insurancecommissioner, says the system was designed for failures bysmall insurers whose operations are geographically limited.&quot;The state system of liquidation and guaranty funds isinherently illsuited to the new kinds of insolvencies,&quot; whichare increasingly large and complex and involve far-flungoperations, he reported in a study last year.   Even small insolvencies have tested the ability of thestate system. Sidney and Mandy Verdin, of Montegut, La.,suffered a serious accident in 1989 that left their cardamaged beyond repair. But that was just the start of theirproblems. They soon discovered that their insurance company,Champion Insurance Co., had become insolvent. So they filedtheir $5,000 claim with the Louisiana Guaranty Association.(While Louisiana has no fund to cover life insurance losses,it has a property and casualty fund.) They waited a year forpayment. In the meantime, because they couldn't affordanother car and were forced to continue paying off their loanon the first one, they were left without transportation.   A year without a car was a challenge for the Verdins. SaysMr. Verdin, 41 years old, who is disabled: &quot;We couldn't getaround, couldn't get to the store. We had to depend onfriends and neighbors to get rides.&quot;   The state insurance funds were originally designed toprotect people precisely like the Verdins. Most of the fundswere set up in the late 1960s and 1970s in response to a waveof insolvencies by automobile insurance companies servinginnercity residents. The problem brought a national outcrybecause the insolvencies had left lower-income people withhigh-rate policies -- or no insurance at all.   States did not act on the issue, however, until they gotscared by talk about federal regulation. By 1970, almost allstates had enacted a law setting up a fund to coverinsolvencies of property and casualty companies. Life andhealth insurance funds began appearing around the sameperiod, albeit at a slower pace.   Unlike the fund to cover bank deposits, which isadministered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., afederal agency, the guaranty funds are run by the insuranceindustry itself through state guaranty associations. Andwhile the deposit-insurance funds are continually funded byassessments to banks, the guaranty funds' coffers are emptyuntil an insurer becomes insolvent. Insurance companies inthe same lines of business as the failed company then ante upa percentage of their premiums in states where policyholdersare affected.   In general, the life-insurance funds cover death benefits,the cash value of participating life insurance and thepresent value of annuities up to various state limits. Somefunds cover so-called unallocated annuities, although themaximum payment allowed by any state is a relatively low $5million. Health and disability policyholders are coveredunder separate funds in many states. Property and casualtyfunds cover all types of claims up to a limit of $300,000 inmost states, although workers' compensation payments have nolimit under most state funds.   The funds vary greatly in size, depending on the totalpremiums collected in the state. Vermont's fund, which cancollect no more than 2% of premiums paid to insurers, canraise only $5.8 million to pay policyholders, whileneighboring New Hampshire, with a 4% cap, can scrape together$28 million. Funds in New York, North Carolina and Illinoiscan raise over $200 million.   Those kinds of variations can lead to big problems insituations such as First Executive's. The Southern FinanceProject, a North Carolina research group that examined theability of the guaranty funds to meet obligations of FirstExecutive's California unit at the request of Sen.Metzenbaum, found that many states' insurance funds could bewiped out by losses of First Executive should it be declaredinsolvent.   The study says if First Executive's losses total $1.2billion -- a conservative estimate unless other companiescome to the rescue -- California residents are likely to fileclaims of $332 million to that state's guaranty fund. That isalmost twice its $175 million annual capacity. If lossestotal $5 billion, 30 states' funds would run out of money,the study says.   Such predictions are more than conjecture. Last year,Louisiana's $60 million fund for property and casualtycompanies ran dry as a result of claims from the roughly $150million insolvency of Champion Insurance Co., the Verdins'automobile insurer. Mr. and Mrs. Verdin, who received allthat they were owed, were lucky: Some other policyholders whofiled claims were paid only one-third.   Still, regulators say guaranty funds have come a long waysince the failure of Baldwin United, the largest failureuntil First Executive. Part of the problem then was that thefund in Indiana, where Baldwin was based, was technically onthe hook for Baldwin's entire $279 million deficit. Understate law then, the fund covered all losses of companiesbased in the state. But the fund's ability to assess theindustry was capped at $50 milion.   There were other weak links in the system. Roughly a dozenstates then had no fund to cover life insurance losses. In apiecemeal solution, brokers and salesmen who sold Baldwinannuities came up with $167 million, state guaranty fundsprovided $62 million and the insurance industry voluntarilycontributed $50 million. Still, policyholders took a hit,with interest rates on certain policies cut nearly in half.   Now, most states' funds cover only the losses of their ownresidents. And the number of states without funds has beennarrowed dramatically. Says Eden Sarfati, president of theNational Organization of Life and Health Insurance GuarantyAssociations: &quot;The result of Baldwin was that it increasedthe amount of money that can be raised to solve a problem.&quot;   Theoretically, the total that can be raised through thelife, health and annuity funds each year is $3.1 billion.That figure is deceptive, however, according to IndianaUniversity's Mr. Belth. &quot;Some of that has been used for otherinsolvencies,&quot; he says. &quot;And when you get down to a singleline of business, it's a smaller number.&quot; For example, onlyabout $2 billion of the $3 billion could be raised for FirstExecutive since it is not in the health-insurance business.   First Executive has highlighted a different set of holesin the safety net that were not tested by Baldwin's failure.Chief among them: First Executive's $3.1 billion inoutstanding guaranteed investment contracts, or GICs, a typeof investment sold to pension funds. In fact, coverage of GIClosses is a good example of the crazy-quilt of state guarantylaws:   Fifteen states provide coverage for GIC losses. Thirteenspecifically exclude coverage for GIC losses. In the rest ofthe states, flip a coin: Their laws don't say how they'dtreat GIC holders in an insolvency.</TEXT></DOC>
