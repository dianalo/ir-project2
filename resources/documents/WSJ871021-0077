The dollar also attracted investors seeking refuge from the panic in a number of equity markets around the world.    &quot;In a crisis like this, people run to a haven currency, and that is usually the dollar,&quot; Joseph J. Spendley, vice president and treasurer of the New York office of Girozentrale Vienna, a major Austrian bank, said.    Many traders blamed some of the world stock markets' plunge, as well as the dollar's initial decline this week, on hints by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker last week and over the weekend that the U.S. might allow the dollar to weaken in response to West German interest-rate rise.    His statements seemed to signal a breakdown of an accord on economic cooperation among the Group of Seven nations -- the U.S., West Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy, and Canada.    Yesterday, however, major governments sought to persuade the financial markets of their continued solidarity on matters of policy, particularly exchange-rate stability.    &quot;They just cannot afford to have the dollar depreciate at the moment. They have to bring calm to the markets,&quot; Mr. Spendley said.    The effort appeared to have succeeded yesterday, as far as the dollar was concerned. In late New York trading, the U.S. currency showed a 2.3% rise to 1.8128 West German marks, from 1.7718 Monday, and was up 2.1% to 144.36 Japanese yen from 141.33.    The dollar's surge carried over from a rally just before the close of Monday's New York trading. That advance started after the Treasury Department announced that Secretary Baker and West German finance officials had met and mended their differences.    Yesterday, the West German central bank cut short-term interest rates for the first time in several months, apparently as a result of Mr. Baker's agreement with the officials.    &quot;There is grave concern that you need to establish currency stability in order to establish stability in the other (stock) markets. The governments of the world appreciate this now,&quot; Jeff Mondschein, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York, said.    One reason the U.S. currency responded so well yesterday was the renewed possibility of major central bank intervention to prop up the dollar.    &quot;People are afraid to sell dollars, because there's fear that there will be some serious intervention this time,&quot; Samuel F. Lek, a currency trader at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., New York, said.    The major central banks are estimated to have spent $90 billion on currency market intervention this year, mainly to stabilize the dollar, and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg indicated yesterday that there would be more intervention if necessary. He told a news conference in Bonn that &quot;we don't rule out any instruments&quot; to stabilize the dollar.    In Tokyo, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita was one of several finance officials who attempted yesterday to dispel panic in the financial markets. He said he welcomed the reaffirmation of agreements on exchange-rate stability by Secretary Baker and West German officials. Mr. Sumita also blamed the &quot;conspicuously wild fluctuations&quot; in the world's money and stock markets on &quot;overly pessimistic views of market participants about the future.&quot;    The dollar's strength yesterday, however, doesn't change the long-term negative outlook for the currency, traders said. The problems of the U.S. trade and budget deficits, which have been pressing the dollar lower for more than two years, remain unresolved.    &quot;It's going to take a while to undo what Baker has done. They have to convince the world that the dollar shouldn't drop further,&quot; Leslie A. Puth, a corporate trader at Banque Indosuez in New York, said. &quot;When the dust settles, I think you'll see more pressure on the dollar.&quot;    Many other dealers also blamed Mr. Baker for unsettling world markets with his comments about the U.S. possibly letting the dollar fall. The remarks sent the dollar plunging in overseas trading Monday that coincided with the collapse of many stock markets abroad.    &quot;I'm sure he didn't intend to create this mess, but I'm just as sure that he created it,&quot; Mr. Lek of Bear Stearns said.    There was a rumor in the currency markets yesterday that Mr. Baker had resigned as Treasury secretary and would be succeeded by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker. It was unsubstantiated, and no U.S. officials even bothered to deny it, but talk of such a switch &quot;actually supported the dollar, which is an indication of what the financial community wants,&quot; Albert Soria, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Swiss Bank Corp.    &quot;It just shows that we're looking for confidence,&quot; another trader said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $18.50 an ounce to $463.20 in very heavy trading. Estimated volume was 10 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $466.50 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Tuesday, Oct. 20, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
