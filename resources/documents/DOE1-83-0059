The magnetic susceptibility chi of ErBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub7}/sub -//sub y/ follows a Curie--Weiss law both above and below T/subc/ with the magnetic moment P/sub eff/ = 9.2{mu}/sub B/, which is closeto that of 9.58{mu}/sub B/ deduced from the ground state of Er{sup 3+}ion. Magnetization data at various temperatures have revealed a verylarge magnetic hysteresis. By analyzing the hysteretic magnetizationdata, we obtain the critical current density J/sub c/(H) and the reversiblemagnetization M/sub e/(H) at 4.2 K. The saturation of M/sub e/ in highfields at low temperature can be explained by the standard theory ofparamagnetism with a Brillouin function. We find that superconductivityand paramagnetism in ErBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7}/sub -//sub y/ existlargely independently of one another.</TEXT></DOC>
