<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-67-0423 </DOCNO><TEXT>Long-term experiments were conducted on herbaceous species at constantmicroclimatic conditions and at natural conditions on simplified standsof Middle-European grassland-vegetation units using atmospheric CO/sub2/ concentrations from 270 to 650 {mu}l l/sup -1/ CO/sub 2/. At elevatedCO/sub 2/ supply stems grow longer and more voluminously, leaf areasincrease, and in most cases more material is translocated to storageorgans. A minor CO/sub 2/ impoverishment (270 {mu}l l/sup -1/ CO/sub2/) leads to overproportionate losses in production. Increasing CO/sub2/ concentrations have more effect at lower than at higher CO/sub 2/levels. The CO/sub 2/ enrichment effect is enhanced by increasing lightintensities. Increasing temperatures support the positive CO/sub 2/ effectup to 35degC beyond that their effect is negative. Grassland ecosystemscan only be an effective sink for additionally emitted CO/sub 2/ duringtheir juvenile phases and after mowing. This CO/sub 2/ effect on thesystems decreases in the second year considerably. CO/sub 2/ enrichmentinfluences the performance of grassland species in competition. At thebeginning of growth the absolute nutrient uptake increases with CO/sub2/ enrichment which can lead to nutrient deficiencies on poorer soils.Two mathematical methods were developed for modelling the CO/sub 2/ effecton grassland-ecosystems in dependance of many ecological factors.</TEXT></DOC>
