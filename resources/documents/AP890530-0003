When it came, he climbed aboard a leaky boat bound for thePhilippines, surviving on seaweed and urine during an arduousjourney that ended in April. He hopes to go to the United States.   ``Right now, I am very happy, but I long for the family,'' saidSanh, who made the journey with a daughter but left behind his wifeand two sons. ``I long my wife and my children. I think, for sure,we will be together again.''   Sanh is part of a new increase in the number of people willingto scrape together their life's savings and risk their lives toflee Vietnam in shoddy vessels provided by criminals.   According to the United Nations, nearly 72,000 ``boat people''were in Southeast Asian refugee camps at the end of April, comparedwith nearly 41,000 by the same time last year _ a nearly 60 percentrise.   Fourteen years after the Vietnam War, the threat of pirates,prison-like refugee camps and countless days at sea without foodand water have not discouraged the exodus. But the unrelenting flowhas put new pressure on Vietnam to find a solution.   Filipino authorities report a 300 percent increase in the numberof arrivals this year. Malaysia recorded 11,500 arrivals betweenJanuary and May 20, nearly double the same period last year.Another 10,012 landed in Hong Kong during the first five months,about double the number for the same period in 1988.   Since 1975, more than 1.5 million Vietnamese have fled theirhomeland by sea.   The desperation to leave can lead to remarkable feats. OnMonday, a small wooden boat carrying 107 Vietnamese refugees landedon an uninhabited island in southwestern Japan after a 40-dayvoyage, officials said.   It was the first time since 1977 that a boat carrying Vietnameserefugees reached Japan directly from Vietnam, the office of theU.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Japan said.   The Vietnamese, whose numbers included 14 children, toldinvestigators they left because of their hard lives and becausethey wanted to live in a ``peaceful place,'' officials said.   Under international pressure, Vietnam has agreed to attend aconference in Geneva, Switzerland, on June 13 on ways to curb theexodus and arrange for the legal departure of those who want toemigrate.   But some officials fear Vietnam will use the meeting to pressurethe United States, Japan and other developed countries for moreeconomic aid.   U.N. and government officials are uncertain what has caused thelatest increase. Some suspect Vietnamese are rushing to get outbefore the Geneva conference, fearing it will result in agreementto stem the flow.   ``People are feeling that this is their last chance,'' said aWestern relief agency official based in Bangkok.   But Filipino officials said most of the refugees arriving herehad not even heard of the Geneva conference. Most say they leftbecause of deteriorating economic conditions and the hope of abetter life.   Faced with a growing influx, the six-member Association ofSoutheast Asian Nations agreed in March to screen Indochineserefugees and send back those who cannot prove political persecution.   But member nations _ Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,Singapore and the Philippines _ have not uniformly implemented thenew rule pending the outcome of the Geneva conference.   ``The Geneva conference must find a solution,'' said oneMalaysian official. The official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Malaysia was ``fed up'' with the refugee problem.   Some relief officials believe the recent increase may forceMalaysia and others to press for the forcible return of boat people.   But in Hong Kong, a British Crown Colony, officials expect tospend about $40 million from the local treasury to care for themore than 34,000 ``boat people'' jammed into enclosed camps in thealready overcrowded territory.   Under a tougher policy adopted in June, Hong Kong classifies allVietnamese arrivals as illegal immigrants, subject to repatriation,unless they can prove political persecution.   Those who are assured of relocation in another country areclassified as refugees. Only about 14,000 have been designated``refugees.''   Last year, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and Vietnamagreed on a voluntary repatriation program for Vietnamese in HongKong who have grown tired of waiting for resettlement.   So far this year, 143 ``boat people'' have returned to Vietnam.Another 75 are preparing to return in June, officials said.   Most of the refugees in Southeast Asian camps expect to travelon to new homes in the United States or Western Europe. Few expectto settle elsewhere in Southeast Asia.   But Southeast Asian countries fear developed nations will cutback further on their quotas, leaving them with thousands ofunwanted refugees.   The U.S. quota for Vietnamese in 1987 stood at 8,500 from theOrderly Departure Program _ under which Vietnamese can legallyemigrate _ and 32,000 ``boat people.'' Washington is consideringaccepting 50,000 Vietnamese this year.   Without improvement in the Vietnamese economy, some officialsfear the exodus will continue.   Porfirio Leyson, acting chief of a Philippine government transitcenter, said 70 percent of the refugees say they fled in search ofa better economic future.   ``For them, it's do or die.'' Leyson said.</TEXT></DOC>
