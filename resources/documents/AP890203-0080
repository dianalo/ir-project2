A police officer was beaten by protesters and taken to ahospital, but his condition was not immediately known, the YonhapNews Agency reported.   The protesters were among about 1,000 people who marched throughdowntown after an outdoor rally denouncing the government ofPresident Roh Tae-woo and the United States, the news agency said.   About 200 people, mostly students, dashed from the crowd hurlingrocks and dozens of firebombs when about 800 police halted the march50 yards from the U.S. cultural center, Yonhap reported.   It said the marchers dispersed voluntarily a short time later.   The authoritarian government killed about 200 people when it putdown an uprising in Kwangju in 1980. The protesters accused the Rohgovernment of blocking efforts to investigate the suppression of therevolt.   Opposition and dissident figures say some military leadersinstigated the uprising as part of a plot to seize power in thechaotic days that followed the death of then-President ParkChung-hee in late 1979.   They say the United States acquiesced in a military plan tosuppress the revolt ruthlessly and therefore is partly to blame forthe deaths.   The United States has denied the charges and said it willcooperate with a parliamentary committee investigating the revolt.   Parliamentary officials said today that next week they will senda questionnaire to two Americans, William Gleysteen and JohnWickham, and ask them to clarify any U.S. role in the case.   Gleysteen was the U.S. ambassador and Wickham served as the topU.S. military commander at the time of the uprising.</TEXT></DOC>
