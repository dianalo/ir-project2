Lloyd Bentsen raises his hands above his head like the victor in a boxing match.    &quot;I can't help but think about how Jack Kennedy won, coming from behind,&quot; the Democratic vice presidential candidate tells cheering students at California State University here.    All of the polls indicate that Sen. Bentsen and Michael Dukakis will go down to defeat in next week's presidential election. But the Texas senator still stands to be a big winner.    He is almost certain to win his simultaneous Senate re-election race. He would return as chairman of the Finance Committee, but, even more significantly, as a more influential Democratic leader. &quot;He will go back with an aura of toughness and political skill he didn't have before,&quot; says Norman Ornstein, a political analyst with the American Enterprise Institute.    The result could be clashes with a President Bush. Angered by Mr. Bush's negative campaign, Sen. Bentsen could be moved to be less low-key and more skeptical of White House legislative requests. A Bush victory wouldn't carry a mandate for Congress, Mr. Bentsen contends. &quot;It could hardly be called a mandate if you have that kind of negative campaigning that elected you,&quot; he asserts.    The election might not be without its downside for Mr. Bentsen, however. He was put on the ticket to win Texas for Mr. Dukakis, but the Democratic team could wind up losing big there. Moreover, Mr. Bentsen may not shine as brightly when he no longer is being compared with GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle and even Mr. Dukakis.    But Sen. Bentsen has clearly gained strength as the result of his vice presidential campaign. According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, voters view him more favorably than any of the other three candidates on the major national tickets; he gets a 57% favorable rating vs. only 26% unfavorable.    With the Democratic Senate leadership in transition -- Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia is relinquishing his majority leader post -- Sen. Bentsen's standing will be even more enhanced. The media will turn to him as a national spokesman for Democratic positions, especially on such issues as taxes and trade.    Sen. Bentsen, 67 years old, was first elected to the Senate in 1970 and is one of its most respected members. His key role in the Senate puts him in a position to process important legislative requests by a Bush administration. His Finance Committee oversees such matters as taxes, Medicare, Social Security, welfare and trade. Thus, his panel would have a vital say on such Bush campaign proposals as reducing the capital-gains tax.    Next year, the committee also will be faced with a series of hotly debated issues, including the budget deficit, health care for the uninsured, long-term health care and steel import quotas. If Vice President Bush wins, such issues could produce land mines for him in Sen. Bentsen's panel.    &quot;Most of the really sensitive things you can get in trouble on go through the Finance Committee,&quot; says John Rother, legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons.    Sen. Bentsen refuses any hypothetical discussion of what will happen if the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket fails. &quot;I don't have time to focus on that. I'm focusing on this election. I've got my work cut out for me,&quot; he declares.    Yet, the bitterness of the campaign clearly could carry over to his Senate dealings with a Bush administration. Mr. Bentsen is the kind of conservative Democrat that even Republicans sometimes praise. But this presidential campaign has been so nasty that its aftertaste may linger well into the next Congress and exacerbate tensions.    &quot;Some of that sticks&quot; and undermines the confidence of the American people in the political process, Mr. Bentsen says of campaign mudslinging. &quot;I think it has been a miserable campaign from that standpoint,&quot; he complains, comparing the Bush effort to a &quot;demagogic campaign for county sheriff.&quot;    If Mr. Dukakis loses, Sen. Bentsen also may find himself involved in a simmering dispute among Democrats over the direction of the party. Known as a conciliator in the Senate, Mr. Bentsen could be a central figure in helping the party find itself. He has rapport with party conservatives and moderates. And although Jesse Jackson's forces called Sen. Bentsen's vice presidential nomination a victory for the party's right wing, they also praised the ease with which communications with him were established.    And because his popularity has jumped during this campaign, the senator could become a top fund-raiser and campaigner for local and state Democrats. &quot;This guy is going to be in incredible demand,&quot; says Mr. Ornstein.    One of Mr. Bentsen's strengths is that he doesn't seem to pose a threat to ambitious Democrats who might eye a run for the White House. He ran for president with little success in the 1976 primaries, but few expect him to seek the top spot again. He will be 71 during the 1992 primary season. That, however, will be two years younger than President Reagan was when he won re-election in 1984.
