North Sea crudes spurted as much as 90 cents a barrel inEuropean spot markets, and one U.S. crude-futures contractincreased even more, after Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oilminister and acting president of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, set May 2 as the date forbeginning an emergency meeting in Geneva of the marketmonitoring committee.</LP><TEXT>   Although that policy-setting committee has only eightministers, Mr. Boussena invited all 13 of OPEC's oilministers to attend the meeting, indicating that it could beturned into a full OPEC conference. He then postponed to June25 the regular midyear conference, which previously had beenscheduled to start May 25.   The May 2 meeting &quot;will examine the measures needed tohalt the constant degradation of the market and to raiseprices so as to re-establish them at the level set by OPEC,&quot;Mr. Boussena said.   The announcement sparked heavy trading in most of theworld's oil markets, with prices immediately beginning torise. Accelerating the rally were traders who had bet onfurther price declines and had to quickly buy contracts tocover their positions.   &quot;There was a lot of `short' covering; gasoline was verystrong, but the real interest was in crude,&quot; said EricBolling, an energy futures trader in New York with EdgeTrading Corp.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline forMay delivery spiraled up 2.23 cents a gallon to settle at61.78 cents, while the June motor fuel contract jumped thelimit of two cents a gallon. Heating oil futures also wereup, with June and later months showing the bigger gains.   But the star in futures trading was West TexasIntermediate crude for May delivery. Analysts said it went upfaster because more traders had bet against it in recentweeks as prices plummeted. Also, today is the May contract'slast trading day; that may have contributed to thevolatility.   Whatever the reason, May WTI gained $1.10 a barrel tosettle at $18.06. The June crude contract was up 78 cents to$18.87.   Although analysts and traders generally attributed most ofthe day's price run-ups to the OPEC announcements, few wereprepared to predict whether previously depressed oil marketshad indeed turned around. &quot;I won't say prices have bottomed,&quot;said Mr. Bolling, &quot;but they should be trading higher&quot; in thedays ahead.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices continued their recent pattern ofmoving over a narrow range. The May contract ended with again of 0.40 cent a pound at $1.1660. Nearterm tightness ofsupplies is reflected in the premiums being enjoyed bysoonest-to-expire positions in both London and New York overmore deferred contracts. That, plus the continuing Peruvianminers and smelter workers strike, now in the sixth week,remain the principal underlying price-supporting factors, oneanalyst noted. However, according to William O'Neill, vicepresident for research for Elders Futures Inc., New York,some progress may be taking place in the Peruvian laborsituation. Union leaders representing the workers of SouthernPeru Copper Corp., who walked off March 12, have scheduled ameeting with company officials, he said. Also, Mr. O'Neillsaid, workers who went on strike at the same time at aseparately owned mine, Tintaya, have returned to work.&quot;Although no agreement has been reached, it has been reportedthat union leaders have received an offer they're willing toaccept,&quot; he said. While improvement is possible in thePeruvian situation, he said, it is still unsolved and isoffsetting some of the concern over recent economicstatistics that indicate a slowing economy, particularlyweaker auto sales and poorer employment statistics. Theautomobile industry is a major copper-user. Traders whofollow charts also appear to be more cautious, Mr. O'Neillnoted, since there appears to be resistance around the$1.20-a-pound level for the May contract &quot;and definitelymajor resistance at around $1.25.&quot;                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn, wheat and soybeanfutures contracts rallied late in the trading sessionyesterday amid continuing rumors about the Soviet Union'sinterest in making major purchases. At the Chicago Board ofTrade, wheat prices were also supported by concerns abouttight supplies of soft red winter wheat. Supplies of thecrop, which is grown in the Midwest, usually reach theirtightest levels in the spring before the new wheat cropsbegin to be harvested. As a result, concerns about a squeezeon wheat supplies are traditional in April. Despite therally, the prospects for the wheat crop in the U.S. continueto improve, according to Katharina Zimmer, an analyst atMerrill Lynch andamp; Co., New York. Fields in the Southern Plains,where the hard red winter wheat crop is grown, are generallyin their best condition since the 1988 drought began. Somedry regions of the Pacific Northwest are expected to getmoisture this week.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hog futures contracts roseamid reports that the slaughter continues to lag behindnormal levels because of tight supplies of fattened hogs. Thelow slaughter is causing strong prices of hogs during a timeof the year when prices are usually their weakest. After theclose of trading today, the Agriculture Department is slatedto release its quarterly survey of feedlots in 13 major ranchstates. Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp.,Arlington Heights, Ill., said he expects the department toreport that the number of cattle on feedlots in those statesrose 1% on April 1 from the same 1989 date. That would be thelargest number in feedlots, which fatten cattle forslaughter, during an April 1 survey since 1978. Tradersexpect the report to indicate that the cattle slaughterduring the second quarter will be heavy.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices fell back from Wednesday's gains ona denial by the Soviet Union that it had bought sugar in thefree market. The July contract ended with a loss of 0.26 centa pound at 15.30 cents. This decline erased slightly morethan half of the 0.48 cent gain posted Wednesday. ArthurStevenson, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., NewYork, said that an official of Sakhar, the Soviet sugartrading corporation, stated that the Soviet Union hadn'tbought sugar on the world market. &quot;While that is the answerone would expect, because they aren't going to reveal suchinformation,&quot; Mr. Stevenson said, &quot;I tend to believe themthis time.&quot; Apparently, most traders also thought that way,because many decided to take profits, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
