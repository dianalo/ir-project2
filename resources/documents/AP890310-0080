The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday ruled that the``aboriginal'' rights the natives held in the submerged land, partof the Bering Sea, were not destroyed by the 1971 Alaska NativeClaims Settlement Act, which provided money to resolve all natives'pre-statehood claims of rights in Alaska land.   The 3-0 ruling means several hundred natives from the villages ofGambell and Stebbins can try to prove that drilling in the federallyapproved Lease Sale 57, made up of 2.4 million acres off NortonSound off Alaska's western coast, would hurt their ability to fishand hunt for survival needs.   However, the judges left open the question of whether a 1953federal law that authorized offshore oil and gas leases had affectedthe natives' offshore claims. That issue was returned to a lowercourt.   The natives have sued the Interior Department, contending thatits sale of leases violated their legal rights of subsistencehunting and fishing on undersea federal land, between Alaska'sthree-mile offshore boundary and the 200-mile federal limit.   Carol Daniel of Alaska Legal Services Corp. said the natives havehunted and fished on the ice ``since time immemorial,'' buildingroads and making camps on the ice several miles offshore to catchfish, walrus and whales.   ``The drilling is so dangerous to resources and my clients are sodependent on the resources,'' said Daniel, attorney for thevillagers. ``They don't have access to the same grocery stores (mostpeople do). The sea is their market.''   E. Edward Bruce, attorney for five oil companies that hold leasesin the area, said no decision has been made on whether to appeal theruling.   He said oil companies paid over $300 million for leases in March1983 and completed exploratory drilling several years ago, but hadnot done any drilling for oil production.   Bruce said he had not been told the results of the exploratorydrilling, but he observed that ``the results were not sufficientlypromising to cause further exploratory drilling in the area.''   The federal government in other cases has recognized nativeAmericans' aboriginal rights to follow age-old practices of huntingand fishing for necessities on government land.</TEXT></DOC>
