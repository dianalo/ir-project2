The purposeof this document is to suggest to the device applicant or investigationsponsor important preclinical and clinical tests that should be performedto generate data which will provide reasonable assurance of the safetyand effectiveness of these devices for their intended purposes. Suggestionsand recommendations written in the document reflect methodologies acceptableto CDRH. While use of this document to prepare preclinical and clinicalprotocols and to organize and analyze data will not ensure investigationaldevice exemption (IDE) or premarket approval, it will ensure that appropriatetests are conducted and data are collected to enable FDA to determine whetheror not an application is approvable. IDE or premarket approval can be expectedto follow if tests are conducted properly, data are adequately analyzedand presented, and the test results support application approval. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written requests for copies of the guidance documentto the Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance, Center for Devices andRadiological Health (HFZ-220), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 FishersLane, Rockville, MD 20857, 800-638-2041, calls from within MD 301-443-6597.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Nirmal K.

FDA has recognized the need to develop evaluation criteriafor prosthetic ligament devices since the early 1980's, when several manufacturersdeveloped prosthetic ligament devices and requested approval to begin clinicalstudies. FDA staff members met with representatives of the Society of SportsMedicine in 1983 to discuss the status of prosthetic ligament research.Later that year, a meeting of the Orthopedic and Rehabilitation DevicesPanel (the Panel) was held solely for the discussion of research, evaluation,and regulations of prosthetic ligament devices. DSRD staff initiated preparationof a guidance document in December 1985. In May 1986, DSRD completed a first draft of the document containing preclinicaland clinical test recommendations and suggestions for the preparation ofIDE and premarket approval applications. Panel review and discussion ofthe document was postponed so that the Panel's industry representativecould obtain comments from his constituents. The Health Industry ManufacturersAssociation (HIMA) and the Orthopedic Surgical Manufacturers Association(OSMA) undertook the task of soliciting comments from industry. HIMA providedindustry comments to DSRD shortly before the October 31, 1986, Panel meeting.At this meeting, industry representatives and Dr. Savio L-Y Woo, a professionalnoted for ligament research, provided comments in an open public sessionpreceding the discussion of the document by the Panel. As a result of the October 31, 1986, Panel meeting, two working groupswere established by FDA, based on nominations from the Panel and industry:The Working Group for Evaluating Mechanical Test Recommendations and theWorking Group for Evaluating Biological Test Recommendations. FDA selectedDr. Woo to be the chairman of the Mechanical Test Working Group consistingof a HIMA representative, an OSMA representative, two Panel members, andFDA representatives. The Biological Test Working Group consisted of a HIMArepresentative, an OSMA representative, and FDA representatives. The workinggroups reviewed draft document recommendations which were revised accordingto comments from Panel members, HIMA, and OSMA. After meeting with both working groups, DSRD again revised the documentand accepted further comments from the working groups. Panel members andconsultants reviewed the final draft of the document at the Panel meetingheld on May 7, 1987. The Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Devices Panel votedunanimously to adopt the document with several changes recommended by thatPanel. The document now being made available to the public incorporatesthose changes. The Panel and industry requested that the document be reviewed again in1 year at a meeting of the Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Devices Panel.The document will be reviewed and, if necessary, revised every 2 yearsthereafter. The guidance document does not state regulatory requirements.It is intended as a scientific position paper, and suggests some evaluativecriteria, test procedures, and end points that FDA believes to be important.Alternate approaches are acceptable for satisfying IDE and PMA requirements;however, it must be demonstrated that alternate procedures are appropriateand adequate. The guidance document is available for public examination in the DocketManagement Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday throughFriday. Interested persons may, at any time, submit written comments regardingthe guidance document to the Dockets Management Branch (address above).Such comments will be considered in determining whether further amendmentsto, or revisions in, the guidance document are warranted. Two copies ofany comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit onecopy. Comments should be identified with the docket number found in bracketsin the heading of this document. Received comment may be seen in the officeabove between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 18, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John M.
