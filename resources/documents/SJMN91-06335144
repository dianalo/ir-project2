General Dynamics Chairman William A. Anderssaid the research retreat is likely to continue, at least as long as industryprofits continue to lag.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DEFENSE CONTRACTORS GET Randamp;D GO-AHEADU.S. TO REIMBURSE FIRMS' RESEARCH  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     While Anders' hard-nosed attitude, which is widely shared in the defenseindustry, has won applause from Wall Street, it is ringing alarm bells inCongress and the Pentagon. The fear is that U.S. technological superiority,considered the key to winning wars in the future, will erode.;   Playing onthat concern, the defense industry won a major concession this month fromCongress in its 1992 Pentagon authorization bill. By 1995, the Pentagon willreimburse its largest contractors for the full cost of their &quot;independent&quot;research and development, up from the average 80 percent reimbursement theynow receive.;   Independent Randamp;D, as opposed to contracted Randamp;D that is wonafter competitive bidding, is largely in-house research done at the company'sinitiative and not the result of a specific directive from the Pentagon. Manybreakthrough developments in radar, stealth and propulsion engine technologystarted through independent Randamp;D.;   At the least, this change in Pentagonaccounting procedure will ensure that defense companies are fully reimbursedfor the Randamp;D they already do, fattening industry profits $500 million to $1billion a year by 1995, according to administration and industry estimates.Although the total sum is large, there is no direct appropriation that goesalong with it. Instead, the extra 20 percent will be added to the cost ofnearly every tank, plane and ship the Pentagon had planned to buy.;   Byincreasing funding and decreasing oversight for company Randamp;D, proponents aimedto &quot;stimulate companies to increase&quot; their independent Randamp;D, said WilliamAndehazy, a House Armed Services Committee staff member.;    But industryexecutives concede that is unlikely.;   &quot;I don't think it will change ourresearch program much at all,&quot; said Russ McClintock, a Washington-baseddirector of Boeing Co.'s space and defense group.;   Bernard Schwartz,chairman of Loral Corp., said 100 percent reimbursement will remove apsychological barrier that often caused him to look more critically atresearch budgets than he should have. But he couldn't think of any particularresearch project he would fund now that he wouldn't have funded before.;   Of10 defense contractors contacted, only Westinghouse Electric Co. predicted a&quot;significant&quot; increase in independent research.;   For aggressive companieslike Westinghouse or Martin Marietta, the new Randamp;D rules are likely to be usedas part of a larger effort to steal market share from competitors. But forothers, their impact will be overwhelmed by other forces now buffeting theindustry.;   With the Pentagon's procurement budget expected to decline 25 to33 percent during the next decade, many companies are reluctant to plow moneyback into what they see as a declining business. For such firms, 100 percentreimbursement is better than 80 percent -- but investing money in areasoutside the defense business may look more inviting.;   Competitive pressuresalso work against defense Randamp;D spending. Although the new law allows fullreimbursement of research expenses, that cost has to be factored into the bidsa company makes in competing for new weapons contracts. Companies that spendrelatively more on research may gain a technological edge sometime in thefuture. But in the here and now, they could find themselves underbid bycompanies that continue to slash Randamp;D budgets.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911130  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  605  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, November 30, 199100335144,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
