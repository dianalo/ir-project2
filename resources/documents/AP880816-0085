He took a long, loud sip, then professed gridiron kinship withthe former Eureka College player whose exhortation to Bush mimickeda line from one his movies.   ``I played football, too,'' Unangst said. ``Touchdown! Greatspeech.''   Mother's is about a dozen blocks from the Louisiana Superdome,where Reagan's emotional farewell was cheered Monday night bydelegates to the Republican National Convention.   The fuzzy presidential image came from a small television set,rigged high on a wall between a velvet toy elephant head and a signthat warned, ``Caution: Men Drinking.''   Reagan's goodbye played to a near-empty house at Mother's``because all the Republicans are still up the street,'' said ownerJerry Amato.   Amato was braced for a crush of convention visitors after thenightly session ended. Cooks popped pans of biscuits into the oven,and chopped vegetables for the anticipated late diners.   For now, Amato could relax at a table near the front door,puffing a long brown cigar and philosophizing about politics.   ``Me, I'm not political. Not in the party sense _ `I vote thisway or that way.' I'll just walk in the booth and pull the lever,maybe Republican, maybe for the Democrats,'' he said.   ``But I don't mind watching the speech, although we've beenseeing nothing but Republicans,'' Amato said with a laugh.``Besides, there's really nothing else on television.''   ``A beer and Reagan _ what could be more fun than this?'' saidcustomer Lee Bordelon as he dug into a bowl of ham and cabbage.   But Mother's bartender Jack Landry was reverent.   A former Marine who saw Pacific combat in World War II, heconfessed to emotional twinges every time Reagan talks patriotism.   ``Same thing tonight,'' said Landry, 64. ``It's very touching.It goes right through me. It makes me proud to be an American.''   How will he vote?   ``It was the Democrats that sent me to war, not the Republicans.But who knows? I'll decide election day,'' Landry said.   The door swung open and in walked the first post-session diners,easily identified by credentials dangling from their necks.   It was back to business at Mother's.</TEXT></DOC>
