(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican policies have turned the UnitedStates into an international debtor, dependent on foreign investorsto sustain an economy saddled with huge trade and budget deficits,Democrat Lloyd Bentsen told a Los Angeles foreign affairs group.   Saying the Republicans didn't recognize the threat ofinternational economic competition, Bentsen told the World AffairsCouncil ``the United States must be able to compete not onlymilitarily but economically'' if it is to lead the free world andset an example for developing nations.   ``I would suggest that it will profit America little to gain thewhole world of military superiority if we lose the soul of oureconomic capacity,'' he said Thursday. ``It will profit us little tobe military hawks if the competition is between economic eagles andwe are sitting ducks.''   Bentsen said the Republicans were instead spending their timedistorting the Democrats' position.   They have ``twisted the truth to imply that Gov. Dukakis is anapostle of military weakness,'' he said. ``That's just not so.''   Both parties planned to spend the same money on defense, he said,but the Democrats wanted to spend more on planes, tanks and guns andless on nuclear weapons and star wars, he said.   Bentsen also argued that American allies should within four yearsbe made to pay an equal share of the costs of defending the freeworld, and he said Japan should cover the $3.5 billion cost forkeeping U.S. troops there.   While the U.S. spends more than 6 percent of its production onthe military, European nations spend far less and Japan only 1percent, he said.   The burden should be equalized, and he wanted to ``get that onedone in our first term,'' he said.   Taking questions from the group afterward, Bentsen said hesupported some forgiveness of the international debt owed by Mexicoon a ``case by case basis'' and not as a nation as a whole. Mexiconeeded to be treated ``like a company that went bankrupt'' that payspart but not all on its obligations, he said.   Both banks and the U.S. government may have to write off some ofthe debt, he said. The situation with other debtor nations wouldhave to be reviewed individually, he said.   Bentsen planned to continue campaigning in California thismorning and then return to his native Texas, where he will spend thebulk of the time remaining before the election.</TEXT></DOC>
