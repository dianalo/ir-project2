When the relative driftspeed exceeds twice the local Alfven velocity, an electromagnetic ionbeam instability is excited which produces an energetic plasma in theinteraction region with {beta} larger than unity. This energetic plasmapushes out the magnetic field, creating a diamagnetic cavity and launchingoutgoing Alfven waves. Application of the results to recent observationsof hot diamagnetic cavities in the solar wind is discussed. copyrightAmerican Geophysical Union 1988</TEXT></DOC>
