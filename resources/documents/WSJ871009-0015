Although the nighttime incident resulted in no U.S. casualties, the fact that it was the second hostile engagement in the Persian Gulf in less than three weeks could sharpen congressional demands for President Reagan to invoke the War Powers Act to legitimize the U.S. military presence there.    Pentagon officials said the U.S. helicopters acted in &quot;self-defense&quot; after the U.S. force was fired on by the Iranian speedboats, which were on an unidentified mission 15 miles southwest of Farsi Island, a base for Iran's Revolutionary Guards. It wasn't immediately clear to U.S. officials whether the boats were manned by the Guards or by regular Iranian Navy sailors.    Three of the vessels, including a 13-meter-long Swedish-built patrol boat of the &quot;Boghammer&quot; class, sank, with an unknown loss of life. A U.S. Navy patrol boat picked up six survivors, two of whom died on board.    &quot;We have no idea how many men were aboard the three craft that were sunk,&quot; said Fred Hoffman, chief Pentagon spokesman.    Mr. Reagan was informed of the incident at the White House 40 minutes after it occurred at 9:50 p.m. yesterday, Persian Gulf time. The White House declined to comment on the incident. It marked the first time that the U.S. military in the gulf was fired upon since Iraqi missiles hit the frigate Stark last May, killing 37.    In the last hostile encounter, on Sept. 21, U.S. helicopters strafed an Iranian ship in the act of laying mines in international waters. In statements similar to their remarks at that time, Pentagon officials last night said that the U.S. forces were acting &quot;within the rules of engagement&quot; laid down by their commanders.    The officials said the incident was provoked by the Iranians firing on one of the U.S. helicopters which was on a &quot;routine surveillance patrol.&quot; The helicopter summoned help, and responding helicopters returned fire with rockets and machine guns.    Mr. Hoffman said a fourth Iranian gunboat was involved in the firefight but &quot;apparently escaped.&quot;    Mr. Hoffman said U.S. naval craft were continuing to search the neighboring waters for survivors. He said those already pulled out of the sea were being cared for aboard the USS Thach, a frigate assigned to the Navy's Middle Eastern task force.    The clash once again demonstrated how poorly matched Iran is against the U.S. in the two countries' gulf contest. The Iranians apparently missed their U.S. targets in yesterday's nighttime encounter. Iranian television films have shown that the speedboats are armed with nothing more sophisticated than machine guns and grenade launchers.    However, the U.S. helicopters, believed to be using infrared sensors, were able to return fire with lethal effect. The helicopters were backed up by U.S. naval craft, although the warships did not engage in any firing.    The Pentagon refused to identify the type and service affiliation of the helicopters except to say that they &quot;operate out of seaborne platforms.&quot; The helicopters that hit the Iranian mine-layer late last month were manned by specialized Army crews working out of Navy ships.    That incident led Senate Democrats to urge Mr. Reagan to invoke the War Powers Act, a Vietnam-era statute that requires the president to notify Congress of the dispatch of American troops to areas where they could be involved in hostilities. And there has been some discussion of amending the law to force the president into invoking the act under some circumstances.    Mr. Reagan has spurned such demands, however, claiming this would be an unjustified diminution of executive authority. A White House spokesman said last night that Mr. Reagan hasn't decided to invoke the War Powers Act as a result of the day's events, although he will continue to &quot;consult with the Hill as is our practice in incidents of this kind.&quot;    In a separate incident that occurred less than an hour after the exchange off Farsi Island, another U.S. helicopter reported shots fired from an Iranian oil rig in the southern gulf 120 miles east of Bahrain. The U.S. craft couldn't tell, however, whether it was being fired on, and it withdrew without returning fire. The Pentagon said there was no injury or damage on either side.    The U.S. hasn't decided how the bodies of the two Iranian seamen who died aboard a U.S. warship would be returned to Iran, the White House spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
