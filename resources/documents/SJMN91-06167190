Examinations Thursday revealed anabnormal cardiogram. A treadmill-thallium scan showed possible cardiac vesselchanges, which typically translates into a degree of arterial blockage.;   &quot;For me,&quot; Valenzuela said, &quot;it's nice to check this out. Really, I've neverhad any pain or problems. Right now I feel fine. I'm just waiting. I'm notscared.&quot;;    Valenzuela was placed on the 15-day disabled list, which meansGrahe could have at least two starts before Valenzuela is reinstated.;    &quot;Asit sets up right now,&quot; Angels Manager Doug Rader said, &quot;he'll be the guy.&quot;;   Besides, Grahe is used to pitching on Valenzuela's day. In both ofValenzuela's starts, Grahe pitched early in relief.;    Grahe was out-pitchedby Scott Lewis during spring training and subsequently was sent to the minors.This would be another chance to make the rotation, in a fifth position thatsorely needs help. Lewis and Valenzuela have a combined 1-7 record with threeno-decisions.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910615  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  243  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday June 15, 199100167190,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
