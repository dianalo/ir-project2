We hadbeen tasting a succession of chianti classicos -- fresh, spicy, crisp redwines, loaded with charm. All of us were impressed by the forthrightness ofthese wines. The best of them were lively and enormously likable.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Food  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CABERNET SHOULD NOT BE A FIRST WINE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Wine; San Francisco-based Anthony Dias Blue is author of &quot;American Wine&quot; and awriter for numerous trade and consumer magazines.  </MEMO><TEXT>     These enchanting wines were followed by some California cabernetsauvignons. Taking a sip of the first of these I momentarily overlooked thefact that we were proceeding to another type of wine. I was unpleasantlyshocked by what I tasted. My mouth was all set for another fruity chianti;instead I was tasting a bitter, heavily herbaceous, astringent and painfullytannic wine.;   I immediately realized that I was now tasting cabernet andmade the mental adjustment. Tasting the same wine again, knowing it was acabernet sauvignon, I found it to be smooth, complex, varietally true andwell-balanced with excellent aging potential. But the experience had left mewith some nagging doubts.;   Obviously, I have developed a mindset wherecabernet is concerned. Being an experienced taster, I have cultivated aseparate set of criteria for cabernets. When I think back on my own wineeducation, I realize that it took me some years to develop a taste forcabernet sauvignon.;   First I discovered friendly, off-dry wines such asrieslings and chenin blancs. Then I moved on to dryer, more serious whites,particularly chardonnays. My first red was pinot noir and then I becamesmitten with beaujolais, zinfandel and chianti, in that order.;   Some yearslater I started trying to love cabernet sauvignon. It wasn't easy, buteventually I came to appreciate the subtlety and complexity of the best winesmade from this celebrated grape. There is no question that cabernet is one ofthe greatest of all varieties. It is made into some spectacular wines aroundthe world.;   Since I learned how to love cabernet, it has given me greatpleasure. But I promise you that if I had started with cabernet, I would be abeer drinker today.;   The irony that popped into my mind at that recenttasting is the fact that everyone in the wine industry wants to broaden thebase of wine use, yet they keep trying to attract new wine drinkers withcabernet sauvignon, a difficult variety, while ignoring the wines that areeasily and immediately likable.;   In the United States, a relatively smallpercentage of the population consumes an inordinately large share of the wine.Industry experts agree that the only way the American wine business can growsignificantly is for more people to be converted to regular wine drinking.;  The problem is that most wine lists and wine shop displays are created bypeople who know a lot about wine. (Obviously; you wouldn't let someone whodoesn't know anything about wine make up a wine list or buy for a shop,right?) These people tend to perpetuate the fixation that mostwine-knowledgeable people have regarding chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon.They often forget about the entry-level wine drinker and ignore wines that areimmediately easy to like.;   Where, on the average wine list or in the normalwine shop, are those good selections of zinfandel, beaujolais, pinot noir orchianti? Could it be -- and you'll have to forgive my cynicism -- that peopledon't want to push these wines because they are less expensive? True, a waitergets a bigger tip and a wine shop makes a higher markup on a $15 cabernet thanon a $9 zinfandel. But perhaps the new wine drinker who buys the zinfandelrather than the cabernet is more likely to come back for more. Maybe, in thelong run, he is likely to spend more money.;   The point is: We all know thatcabernet sauvignon is a wonderful wine, but it can be an acquired taste. Whynot let beginners cut their teeth on wines that are easier to like, and at thesame time maybe we can avoid becoming a two-variety market.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Anthony Dias Blue column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910821  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  714  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, August 21, 199100234019,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
