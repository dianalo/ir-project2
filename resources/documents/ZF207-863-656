 Imagine trying toput into words all the details in even a simple map!andM;But maps are difficult to draw by hand or digitize, and clip art collectionsoffer only a limited selection of maps.andP;  These are usually in low-resolutionMacPaint format and are tedious to embellish and tailor.andP;  Mac users who needcustom maps -- object-oriented drawings for high-quality printing -- finallyhave a solution in MapMaker 4.0 from Select Micro Systems Inc.andM;Geography of the program.andP;  More than a mere repository of pre-drawn maps,MapMaker is a full-scale object-oriented graphics environment tailored to mapcreation.andP;  The tool palette contains many familiar icons for drawinggeometric shapes and lines and for setting line patterns, fill patterns andcolors.andP;  Your use of color is limited to choosing one of eight foreground andbackground colors for a fixed set of 35 patterns, and you can't design newpatterns within the program.andM;MapMaker's real strengths are its ability to store and retrieve maps as filescontaining boundary and point information and its ability to simultaneouslyimport tab-delimited text files with data on up to 30 categories of values tobe associated with map area subdivisions.andM;For instance, creating a map representing per-capita income in the 50 statesis as simple as opening the U.S.andP;  states boundary file and importing theincome data file.andP;  MapMaker supports a number of map designs, includingstandard pattern fills, dot density fills and area cartograms, in which thesize of map areas corresponds to the magnitude of the associated data.andM;MapMaker comes with a large library -- almost four full disks -- of suchboundary and data files, including boundaries for every county in the 50states, all the Canadian provinces and every country in the world.andP;  The datafiles contain categories and actual values for a respectable number ofgeographic, demographic, financial and vital statistics.andP;  A wide variety ofadditional boundary and data files are available separately.andP;  And, of course,you can create your own data files in any word processor, database orspreadsheet, or enter data directly in MapMaker.andM;In case MapMaker doesn't come with a predefined boundary file for thegeographic area you want, you can still draw your own and have the programconvert it into a custom boundary file.andP;  There's even an auto-trace tool forquick conversion of imported drawings or paintings.andP;  MapMaker also hasbuilt-in support for a number of popular ADB (Apple Desktop Bus)graphic-digitizing tablets.andM;MapMaker lets you automatically insert text labels with the names of mapsubdivisions (such as the names of states), or you can enter your own labels.andO;Likewise, you can have the program default to category names in data files(such as several dollar ranges of per-capita income), or you can manuallyenter your own.andP;  You can generate map legends automatically, too.andM;MapMaker offers a good, but not all-encompassing, number of user options forcustomizing text on maps.andP;  It's quite reminiscent of labeling charts inMicrosoft Excel -- you can do a lot, but in some respects the program isrigid, and you'll have to fine-tune your graphic in an object-orienteddrawing program if you want complete control.andP;  MapMaker can export completeor partial maps as PICT or MacPaint files; it can also import those formats.andO;In addition, it has the capability to export the Flash Art format used byPanorama from Huntington Beach, Calif.-based ProVUE Development Corp.andM;Performance.andP;  We found MapMaker to be versatile and robust.andP;  It will takeawhile to fully master, but that's primarily because it does so much.andP;  Themajor shortcoming we found in the program is that it is limited to one opendrawing window at a time.andP;  If you want to transfer a number of graphics ortext labels between maps, you'll have to use the Scrapbook or a functionalequivalent.andM;Another drawback we encountered is as much the fault of the hardware platformas of MapMaker: It can be very sluggish at redrawing the screen.andP;  The fasteryour Mac, the more you'll like MapMaker.andP;  To mitigate this problem, theprogram offers shortcuts to forestall screen refreshing while you scroll ormake multiple mouse-clicks.andM;To a lesser extent, we were troubled by some annoying deviations from Macuser interface standards.andP;  MapMaker doesn't support Shift-clicking whenyou're making multiple selections on a drawing, nor does it offer a selectionrectangle for groups of objects.andP;  Instead, MapMaker assigns objects and textto a number of layers (such as land areas, points, data value labels andmanually entered text) so you can make global changes to entire classes ofmap features.andP;  This scheme is a mixed blessing, and we'd prefer to also havethe option of using the more traditional methods for making multipleselections.andM;Setting new fonts, sizes and styles within some of MapMaker's dialog boxes isanother curious affair.andP;  Rather than have a scrolling list or pop-up menu ofthe available choices, you have to make your selection from the program'smain menus before opening the dialog box, and then indicate that you want touse the new font choices.andM;However, none of these drawbacks seriously limits MapMaker's basicfunctionality, which we found to be excellent.andP;  You may have to get used to afew techniques that seem awkward at first, but you'll still be able togenerate high-quality maps in short order.andM;MapMaker runs comfortably on Macs from the 512K and up.andP;  Although you can runthe program from floppy disks, a hard disk is certainly preferable.andP;  Theprogram is MultiFinder-aware and needs a minimum 512-Kbyte partition.andM;Documentation and support.andP;  MapMaker's 173-page, spiral-bound manual containsa good tutorial, a complete reference section and a &quot;cookbook&quot; for achievingspecial mapping effects.andP;  It's heavily illustrated, well-organized and, ingeneral, offers all the information and help needed to use this rathercomplex program.andM;In addition, MapMaker has a good inte-grated, on-line help system.andP;  SelectMicro Systems also provides unlimited technical support for MapMaker,although calls are not toll-free.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Despite a few drawbacks, we find a lot to recommend inMapMaker.andP;  It is unique, offering far more than any simple bit-mapped clipart collection.andP;  If you need to create custom maps -- high-quality drawingsthat are suitable for inclusion in your desktop publishing and presentationprojects -- MapMaker is the only affordable game in town, and a sound choiceat that.andM;Select Micro Systems Inc. is located at 322 Underhill Ave., Yorktown Heights,N.Y.andP;
