Stewart07/17/87WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)AEG BABBOND MARKET NEWS (BON)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)AIRLINES (AIR)   At some point, fighting doesn't seem worth it.    Investment bankers at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. have apparently reached that point. The firm has for years refused to go along with the crowd and put the &quot;junk-bond&quot; label on the high-yielding, high-risk securities that it has so successfully marketed.    Instead, the firm has stubbornly clung to the terms &quot;high-yield bonds&quot; or &quot;fallen angels.&quot; Drexel officials were even prepared late last year to bankroll a multimedia blitzkrieg aimed at erasing the term &quot;junk bonds&quot; from the financial lexicon.    But Drexel bigwigs have now decided, grudgingly, to throw in the towel.    A Drexel jogging squad recently sported T-shirts that read: &quot;Junk Bonds Keep America Fit.&quot; And last week, the firm placed a classified advertisement looking for an investment banker with knowledge of &quot;junk bonds.&quot;    Why the change? &quot;You have to go with the flow,&quot; a Drexel official explains.    Echo Across the Sea   Great minds think alike. When Allegis Corp. announced plans to link its reservations system with three European airlines, John Zeeman, United Airlines' executive vice president of marketing, was quoted by a company news release as saying:    &quot;This system heralds the most important development in airline information and reservations system software that Europe will see this century.&quot;    Across the Atlantic, British Airways chief executive Sir Colin Marshall appeared equally enthused. His company issued a news release quoting him as saying:    &quot;This new system heralds the most important development in airline information and reservations system software that Europe will see this century.&quot;    Hey, Aren't You...   Kevin Barry, it seems, is a common name. One Kevin Barry was a hero of the Easter Rebellion in Ireland in 1916, and was hanged by the British. &quot;Practically every Irish family named one of its members after Kevin Barry,&quot; says Kevin A. Barry, one of the namesakes.    Mr. Barry's life was plunged into turmoil on Wednesday, when Brian S. Campbell and another Kevin Barry were subjects of a front-page story in this newspaper that said they are under investigation by the government in the insider trading scandal. The lawyer for that Kevin Barry declined comment on the story.    In fact, though, the two Kevin Barrys have never met, and indeed, have had no ties whatsoever. But the similarities between the two men are so uncanny -- both are tall, athletic, in their early thirties, Manhattan lawyers, and have owned country houses in upstate New York -- that even those closest to the uninvestigated Mr. Barry had their doubts.    Among the messages on his telephone answering machine Wednesday night: &quot;Is this really you?&quot; &quot;What's going on?&quot; &quot;I can't believe it.&quot; Mr. Barry's mother called at 6:30 a.m. the next morning. &quot;Oh my God,&quot; she said. &quot;Your sister is hysterical. I'm hysterical.&quot;    Last night Mr. Barry was scheduled to go before the admissions committee of an exclusive Manhattan cooperative apartment building where he hopes to move. Even a whiff of scandal could be fatal. Moreover, Mr. Barry is in the midst of a career change where any suggestion of moral turpitude could be ruinous. He is hoping to be ordained an Episcopal priest.    ODDS AND ENDS   Jones, Day, Reavis andamp; Pogue, one of the country's largest law firms, last weekend moved into a new Cleveland headquarters. In anticipation, it held a contest to name the atrium courtyard dining facility. Contenders included The Burger Court, Lien Cuisine, Tender Offer, Deposition Digest and Torts. Apparently, though, humor wasn't a criterion in selecting a winner. The dining facility has been named Dobay's, named after Hildegard Dobay, a secretary who worked for the firm for more than six decades. . . The dog ate my homework: 3CI Inc., a small Fort Collins, Colo., software concern said earlier this week that it expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and maybe even for the fiscal year ended March 31, after a profitable nine months. According to President Rajiv P. Mehta, senior managers were so busy raising $7.7 million in a March public offering that they didn't have time to complete several sales. Managers presumably had a little more time in the first quarter, which just ended. Results should be better for that period, Mr. Mehta says. </TEXT></DOC>
