Kohlberg Kravis Robertsandamp; Co. finally won permission from federal regulators to helpbuy a failed bank. KKR won't get voting stock under its jointbid with Fleet/Norstar for the Bank of New England, but onelesson is that Glass-Steagall's hoary separation ofcommercial from investment banking is on its way out.   KKR is best known for its leveraged buy-outs of the 1980s,transactions that have come under a cloud with severalwell-known failures. Before the revisionists make anecdotalclaims that takeovers and leverage were disasters, someoneneeds to set out the evidence.</LP><TEXT>   Merton Miller addressed this issue in his lecture uponreceiving the 1990 Nobel Prize in Economics. &quot;That the LBOentrepreneurs have achieved substantial real efficiency gainsby reconcentrating corporate control and redeploying assetshas been amply documented in a multitude of academic researchstudies,&quot; Prof. Miller said. &quot;But this basically positiveview of LBOs and takeovers is still far from universallyaccepted among the wider public.&quot;   The Nobel Laureate's defense of leveraged buy-outs, junkbonds and hostile takeovers is a timely reminder of the buzzof activity that once energized Wall Street. There wereexcesses, but do the excesses really constitute repudiation?The stronger truth is that the booming economy of the 1980sowed much to this process of corporate creative destruction.It's also true that despite the regulatory and prosecutorialattack on junk bonds, they can still bounce back off theropes as they have in recent weeks.   The evidence shows that the friendly and hostile takeoverswere on the whole good for the companies involved,shareholders, bondholders and the economy. CommerceDepartment figures show that between 1979 and 1990, when toomuch debt supposedly deindustrialized the country,productivity grew by more than 3.5% a year. Manufacturinggrew to 23% of GNP in 1990 from 20% in 1982.   The academic studies proving the benefits of takeoverswould fill a library. Even a cursory review of theirhighlights should bring a tug of nostalgia to thehardest-hearted takeover bashers.   Prof. Miller cited a study by his University of Chicagocolleague Steven Kaplan, which analyzed the largestmanagement buy-outs between 1980 and 1986. He found thatthree years after the buy-outs, the companies had big boostsin both income and net cash flow and had lower capitalexpenditures. Shareholders earned an average 42% premium gainfrom the buy-out, as measured by the share-price boostbetween the price two months before the bid and thecompletion of the buy-out. Mr. Kaplan found that theefficiencies came from better incentives for management andworkers rather than from layoffs. A draft of an update ofthis paper suggests that over time the LBO technique wasapplied to increasingly risky deals, accounting for some ofthe big-name failures.   Another way of slicing the issue is to see what happenedto the share prices of firms that are incorporated in statesthat pass anti-takeover legislation. The news is not good.Drexel University finance professors Samuel Szewczyk andGeorge Tsetsekos studied what happened when Pennsylvaniapassed the nation's toughest anti-takeover bill in April1990.   The total market value of shares in firms covered by thelaw fell by some $4 billion, or by about 5%. Similar studieshave found similar results in other states. A recent articlein the Northwestern Law Review by lawyer Gregory Sidak andeconomist Susan Woodward found that the 1986 anti-takeoverlaw in Indiana cost shareholders nearly 6% of the value oftheir holdings.   The difference in value gives a quantification of thedangers from overprotected management. The problem of theseparation of ownership (shareholders) from control(managers), and the different interests of the two groups,has not disappeared in the 1990s. What has changed is thatmany of the more obvious deconglomeration takeovers havealready been done. Also, the overuse of leverage toward theend of the '80s encountered obvious problems when sufficientnew efficiencies didn't exist to cover the increased debtpayments.   It's also true that despite recent upturns, thenow-politicized market for junk bonds may never again playits previous role. Congress set off a fire sale when itforced thrifts to mark their junk bonds to market. Whether itshould have been legal for government-guaranteed deposits tobe invested in higher-risk debt remains a good question. Oneresult is that thrift foreclosures have made the ResolutionTrust Corp. the third-largest holder of junk bonds. As withreal estate, this creates an overhang in the market. And ofcourse Michael Milken, the glue that once held the markettogether, is biding time in a California prison on a 10-yearsentence notably unrelated to junk bonds.   Some takeovers don't require outside funding. The ongoingATandamp;T-NCR battle shows that some firms have enough capital tofund their own bids. There are also alternatives to takeoversthat serve the function of giving shareholders greater say.Proxy battles encouraged by the institutional investors andby United Shareholders of America threatencorporate-governance changes, golden parachutes and poisonpills at dozens of firms.   No doubt more firms will go into liquidation because theytook on too much debt. But the evidence so far is that the1980s did much more good than harm -- and did more good thananyone imagines can ever come out of the credit crunch of the1990s.</TEXT></DOC>
