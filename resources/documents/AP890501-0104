The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quotedAli Mohammad Besharati as saying Iran must diversify itsarms-purchasing sources.   ``If we depend on one particular country or bloc, then they takeadvantage of the situation ... They want to impose their ownideology on us,'' he said. His comments were published in aninterview with the English-language daily Tehran Times, the agencysaid.   Besharati said in ``extensive talks'' with Soviet officials``all related issues have been finalized.''   He did not disclose what kind of Soviet weapons Iran willacquire or the cost. But the Iranians are known to be seeking toupgrade and rebuild their air force and armored divisions followingthe Aug. 20 cease-fire in the eight-year war with Iraq.   Recently, the Iranians have turned increasingly to the East blocfor much of their military hardware as relations between Tehran andMoscow warmed.   Speculation the Soviets would start supplying the Iranians withsophisticated weapons systems, possibly including aircraft andtanks, was heightened when Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze visited Tehran in February.   The Soviets were Iraq's main weapons supplier during the war andare participating in a major defense exhibition in Baghdad thatends Tuesday. But Iran purchased large amounts of Soviet-designedweapons systems, mainly through North Korea and China.   ``The Soviets are not prepared to go too far as far as theIranians are concerned,'' said Hans-Heino Kopietz, a militaryspecialist with the London-based International Institute forStrategic Studies.   ``They want to play footsy with both sides. Just how muchhardware they will provide the Iranians themselves is questionable.They don't want to be seen to be tipping the balance, but it makessense that they should do something in this regard,'' he said in atelephone interview.   The Moscow-Tehran rapprochement was accelerated by the halt inthe gulf war and the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, whereTehran supports Moslem guerrillass fighting Kabul's communistgovernment.   Before the 1979 reolution, Iran's military was armed almostexclusively with U.S. weaponry bought by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavibefore he was toppled.   A U.S.-led embargo did much to prevent the Iranians acquiringspare parts and replacements for that equipment.   By the end of the war, Iran's once-powerful air power wasreduced to an estimated 60 operational combat jets. Before the war,Iran had 447 combat aircraft, all of them U.S.-supplied. Theyincluded 199 F-4 Phantoms, 166 F-5 Eagles and 77 F-14 advancedinterceptors.   The Iranian agency quoted Besharati as saying: ``We have goneinto negotiations with various countries, outside the Soviet Union,for the purchase of fighter bombers.   ``Very soon, you will see fighter bombers flying ... which areother than those of the United States and the Soviet Unions,'' hesaid without elaboration.   The Iranians claim they soon will build their own combat jets.But Western analysts believe these will be Chinese-supplied F-6 andF-7 jets, Beijing's versions of the MiG-19 and MiG-21, shipped inparts to be assembled in Iran.   U.S. Defense Department sources have reported that Tehran'slinks with the Warsaw Pact countries for arms supplies haveimproved prospects for co-producation deals under which Iran couldbuild Soviet bloc weapons under license.   They estimate Iran is spending up to $5 billion a year on itsforces.</TEXT></DOC>
