Program Description</ITAG>A. Purpose and ScopeOne of the National Science Foundation's principal goals is to assure anadequate supply of high quality mathematicians, scientists and engineersfor the future. This requires continuing efforts to attract talented studentsinto research careers in these fields, and to help ensure that they receivethe best education possible. The undergraduate years are critical in theeducational sequence, as career-choice points and as the first real opportunitiesfor in-depth study.There is wide-spread agreement \1\<NOTE/> that active research experience is one of the most effectivetechniques for training undergraduates for careers in mathematics, scienceand engineering, and that too few such experiences are now available. NSFhas established the <T3>Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program</T3> (REU) to helpmeet this need.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>Undergraduate Science, Mathematics and Engineering Education,</T3>Report of the National Science Board Task Committee on Undergraduate Scienceand Engineering Education, National Science Foundation, March 1986; <T3>National Priorities for Undergraduate Science and Engineering Education,</T3>National Higher Education Associations Task Force, American Council onEducation, 1985.REU plans to provide opportunities annually to several thousand undergraduatestudents to participate in active mathematics, science and engineeringresearch experiences. REU projects will involve students in meaningfulways in either ongoing research programs or research projects speciallydesigned for this purpose.NSF is particularly interested in increasing the participation in researchof women, minority \2\<NOTE/> and disabled students. Projects involving students who aremembers of these groups are particularly solicited.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ For the purpose of this announcement, minorities are definedas members of those racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in scienceand engineering: American Indian, Blacks, Hispanics, Native Alaskan orNative Pacific Islander.Although the categories of awards that are described in this announcementare expected to include the majority of projects supported through theREU program, additional mechanisms for providing undergraduate researchexperiences will be considered by the NSF.Proposals are invited for support of projects that typically will fit intotwo major categories: (1) <T3>REU Sites </T3>and (2) <T3>REU Supplements.</T3>* <T3>Sites</T3> grants will be based on independent proposals to initiateand conduct undergraduate research participation projects for a numberof students appropriate to the discipline and the setting. Most REU Sitesprojects are expected to be within the scope of a single discipline and/orsingle academic department. Interdisciplinary proposals are also acceptable,but multiple discipline or multiple department proposals without a commonproject focus or orientation are discouraged.* <T3>Supplements</T3> to ongoing NSF research grants to provide researchexperiences for a small number of undergraduate students are also encouraged.Projects may be carried out during the summer months, during the academicyear, or both. The Foundation will consider requests for support of one,two or three years duration. Proposals will not be accepted for the REUprogram.B. Eligibility Criteria and Limitations<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Eligible Institutions</ITAG>All U.S. institutions conducting research in the disciplines normally supportedby NSF are eligible to apply. Thus, proposals will be accepted from collegesand universities, from such nonacademic research institutions as governmentor industrial laboratories, or from combinations thereof. There is no restrictionon the number of proposals that may be submitted per institution.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Eligible Fields</ITAG>The Foundation considers proposals for REU support in most of the fieldsof science and engineering. NSF normally will not support biomedical researchwith disease-related goals, including work on the etiology, diagnosis,or treatment of physical or mental disease, abnormality, or malfunctionin human beings or animals. Animal models of such conditions, or the developmentor testing of drugs or other procedures for their treatment also generallyare not eligible for support. NSF does not normally support technical assistance,pilot plant efforts, research requiring security classification, the developmentof products for commercial marketing, or market research for a particularproduct or invention.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Eligible Individuals</ITAG><T3>Principal Investigator.</T3> A single individual should be designatedas Principal Investigator. This individual will be responsible for overseeingall aspects of the award. However, it is expected that additional investigatorswill be involved in many of these projects, particularly in projects involvingdevelopment and operation of REU Sites.<T3>Student Participants.</T3> Undergraduate student participants mustbe citizens or permanent residents of the United States and its possessions.An undergraduate student is a student who is enrolled in a degree program(part-time or full-time) leading to a bachelor's degree. High school graduateswho have not yet enrolled and students who have received their bachelor'sdegree and are no longer enrolled as undergraduates are not eligible.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Eligible Activities and Costs</ITAG>REU award costs, expected to average $4,000 per student for Sites and somewhatless for Supplements, may include stipends for students, salaries of involvedfaculty, relevant student housing costs, indirect costs, and a modest allowancefor supplies. Student stipends for full time summer activity should beat least $2,000, for either type of award, with pro rata equivalent stipendsfor part-time academic year participation.C. DeadlinesProposals for the support of REU Sites are due no later than October 10annually. Award notification will be made to the extent possible by lateJanuary.Proposals for REU Supplements will be accepted at any time, and require2-3 month's processing time. Supplement requests should be submitted asearly in the fiscal year as possible.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Preparation and Submission of Proposals</ITAG>A REU SitesFunds for the establishment of REU Sites may be requested from any of NSF'sresearch directorates: Biological, Behavioral and Social Sciences; Computerand Information Science and Engineering; Engineering; Geosciences; andMathematical and Physical Sciences.Proposals should be prepared following the guidelines contained in theNSF document ``Grants for Research and Education in Science and Engineering''(NSF 83-57, rev. 11/87) and the following instructions. Fifteen copiesof the proposal should be submitted. Each copy of the proposal should contain:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The Cover Sheet (found in Appendix II of the REU program announcement).Clearly indicate the NSF research directorate and/or division to whichthe proposal is directed on the top left box of the form. A list of thesecan be found in the REU Program Announcement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The Budget form 1030 (found in Appendix III of the REU Program Announcement).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The Project Summary Form (found in Appendix IV of the REU ProgramAnnouncement).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The Current and Pending Support Form (found in Appendix V of theREU Program Announcement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Statement of prior support. If either the Principal Investigatoror the Co-principal Investigator received prior support from NSF's REUProgram, the proposal must include a section entitled </ITAG><T3>``Results from prior NSF Support''.</T3> This section must describethe earlier REU project(s) and outcome(s) in sufficient detail to permitreviewers to reach an informed conclusion regarding the value of the resultsachieved. The following information must be included in this summary statement:andbullet; The NSF award number, amount, and period of support;andbullet; Title of the project;andbullet; A summary of the results of the completed work. (To facilitatereview, this summary must not exceed-for REU_three double-spaced pages);and andbullet; A list of publications and/or formal presentations acknowledgingthe NSF award (copies of such papers are not to be submitted with the proposal).Each proposal should reflect the unique combination of the proposing institution'sinterests and capabilities. Cooperative regional arrangements among institutionswill be considered so that a project might increase the quality or availabilityof undergraduate research experiences.REU Sites projects must have a well defined common focus. This is usuallyachieved within the scope of a single discipline or academic department,although an interdisciplinary proposal with cohesively integrated projectsis acceptable. In general, multiple-discipline or multiple-department proposalsare not encouraged.The proposal should discuss the features of the proposed project in sufficientdetail that it can be evaluated in accordance with the goals of the REUprogram and the criteria articulated in section III. The narrative descriptionof the program should not exceed 15 double-spaced pages in length. Thenarrative should include a description of:Nature of Student ActivitiesNSF believes undergraduate research experiences have their greatest impactin situations that lead the participants from a relatively dependent statusto an independent one as great as their competence warrants. In this context,proposals must present plans that will ensure the regular development ofstudent-faculty interaction and student-student communication. Proposalsshould address the philosophy of the approach to undergraduate researchtraining being taken, and should provide detailed descriptions of examplesof projects in which students will become involved.The Research EnvironmentThe facilities and equipment available to support these undergraduate researchexperiences should be summarized. A tabular summary or similar indicationof graduates continuing their education at the graduate level may be incorporatedhere.Student ParticipantsStudent recruitment and selection processes and criteria should be clearlydescribed. A major goal of the program is to involve students in researchwho might not otherwise have the opportunity, particularly those from institutionswhere research programs are limited. This especially includes women, minority,and disabled students. For this reason, projects whose student participantsinclude significant fractions outside the host institution, and that presentconvincing plans for involving underrepresented student groups will receivespecial consideration in the award selection process.The number of students per project should be appropriate to the institutionalsetting and to the manner in which research is conducted in the discipline.However, developing collegial relationships and interactions is an importantpart of the project opportunity. Therefore the Foundation expects thatthe norm for REU Sites will be about 8 students, and proposals involvingfewer than 4-6 students are discouraged.The following items should also be included in the proposal (these itemsdo not count as part of the 15 page narrative limit):<T3>Budget  </T3>The proposal should include a detailed project budget and budget justification,as described in NSF 83-57, rev. 11/87. Use the NSF Form 1030 in AppendixIII of the REU Program Announcement. As a guide to budget development,student stipends for summer projects are expected to be at least $2,000with academic year stipends comparable on a pro rata basis. All studentcosts should be entered at line F. of Form 1030. Total costs are expectedto average around $4,000 per student. The amount of total indirect costsallowed for REU (enter at line I of form 1030) is limited to 25% of studentstipends. Institutional commitment to the project should be clearly describedand may include such items as faculty salaries, student housing, travel,tuition, reduced indirect costs or lab use.  An REU Site involving 8 students (where travel is anticipated) might havethe following budget distribution: student stipends_$16,000; student travel_$2,400;student subsistence_$5,600; materials and supplies_$800; indirect costs(at 25% of student stipends)_$4,000; for a total of $28,800. This distributionis meant as an example only. Budgeted amounts may be more or less thanshown. Institutions may choose to absorb some of these expenses as theircommitment to the REU Site. Various NSF Directorates may permit a modestallowance for other expenses (such as faculty support) or even excludesome of those listed in the example. It is advisable to check with theappropriate Directorate/Division when questions of budget are concerned(see Program Announcement).  <T3>Biographical Sketches and Individual Support</T3>  A biographical sketch (not to exceed 1 page) for each of the key personneland list of recent publications (last five years), <T3>involving and identifying undergraduate authors, </T3>should be included.An asterisk should be used to identify undergraduate students who servedas co-authors. A table must be provided which summarizes each individual'scurrent and pending research support from all sources. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>The Principal Investigator must have submitted NSF form98A (Final Project Report) for all completed NSF funded projects. </ITAG><T3>Proposals must be received in the Foundation by 5:00 p.m. on October10 annually to insure inclusion in the competitive review process establishedfor this program.  </T3>Materials required:  15 legible copies of the complete proposal;  One copy of NSF form 1225 (found in Appendix I of the REU Program Announcement)attached to the signature copy of the proposal only;  Three sets of <T3>extra </T3>forms, each stapled into a unit and containing <ITAG tagnum="15">One copy of the Cover Sheet </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">One copy of the Budget, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">One copy of the Project Summary Form. </ITAG>These materials should be submitted to:  Data Support Services Section, REU, National Science Foundation, Room 223,1800 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20550.  <T3>B. REU Supplements  </T3>Funding may be requested from any of NSF's directorates to supplement anongoing NSF research grant or contract. As with other supplement requests,these should be sent directly to the NSF Program Officer who was designatedas the cognizant program official when the research award was made.  Requests for supplemental funding should be in the form of a letter, signedby both the principal investigator and the appropriate institutional official.This letter should state clearly that this is a REU Supplement request,and should articulate in some detail the form and nature of the prospectivestudent(s)'s involvement in the research project(s). If the student(s)has not been preselected, a brief description of the selection processand criteria should be included. If the student(s) has been preselected,the grounds for selection and a brief biographical sketch of the studentshould be included. Normally funds will be available for up to two students,but exceptions will be considered for training additional minority, physicallydisabled and women students.  The request letter should be accompanied by a signed budget page includinginformation about the funds requested and their proposed use. Use NSF Form1030 for this purpose. As a guide to budget development, student stipendsfor summer projects are expected to be at least $2,000 with academic yearstipends comparable on a pro rata basis. All student costs should be enteredat line F. of Form 1030. Total costs are expected to average about $4,000per student. The amount of total indirect costs allowed for REU Supplements(enter at line I of form 1030 is limited to 25% of the student stipends.Attach the letter of request and form 1030 of the Cover Sheet (AppendixII of the REU Program Announcement) and a Project Summary Form (AppendixIV of the REU Program Announcement) and mail to the appropriate NSF ProgramDirector.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Proposal Evaluation</ITAG>REU Sites proposals will be evaluated by external merit review, involvingscientists, engineers and mathematicians drawn from the academic and industrialcommunity.REU Supplements proposals will be evaluated by NSF program staff.The same general evaluation criteria will be applied to all REU proposals:andbullet; The appropriateness and value of the educational experience forthe student(s), particularly the appropriateness of the research project(s)for undergraduate involvement and the nature of student participation inthe these activities.andbullet; The quality of the supervisor(s) and attendant facilities, includingany specialized equipment and its availability to student participants,and the proposer's experience with undergraduate research activities.andbullet; The overall merit of the research activities.andbullet; Additional criteria will be applied to proposals to establishREU Sites:andbullet; The adequacy of procedures for selecting participants, and formatching selected participants with research supervisors;andbullet; The quality of plans for student preparation and followthroughdesigned to promote continuation of student interest and involvement inresearch;andbullet; The effectiveness of arrangements for managing the project;andbullet; The record of the institute in motivating students to pursue careersin mathematics, science or engineering;andbullet; The degree of institutional commitment to the project;andbullet; The plans for involving underrepresented groups in research.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Program Assessment</ITAG>The National Science Foundation periodically reviews its programs to assesswhether they are achieving their goals. Evaluation of the REU program necessarilyinvolves assessing the impact of the research experience on the undergraduateparticipants. The Project Summary Form included in the REU Program Announcementas Appendix IV requests information about the makeup of the anticipatedstudent participants. Those receiving REU awards must keep track of themakeup of the actual student participants. The student profile informationshould be submitted at the time of the Final Project Report. However, insome cases, this information may be requested by NSF prior to the dateof completion of the award.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
