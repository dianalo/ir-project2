The pace quickened this week, however, with President Bush'sannouncement late Tuesday that he intended to appoint Richard ThomasCrowder, a Pillsbury Co. executive, as undersecretary forinternational affairs and commodity programs.   Crowder's selection was the third announced for USDA since Bushbegan putting his team together last fall. The other two wereAgriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, the only one yet confirmed,and Jack Parnell of California, named Feb. 28 as deputy secretary,the No. 2 job in the department.   Other senior positions include one other undersecretary for smallcommunity and rural development and seven assistant secretarieshaving responsibilities for a wide range of USDA services, fromforeign affairs to meat inspection and public information.   Yeutter's salary is $99,500 a year, the deputy's $89,500, theundersecretaries' $82,500, and the assistant secretaries' $77,500.   Additionally, there are dozens of deputies at all levels,administrators of various USDA agencies, plus scores of statedirectors for certain of the agencies _ not to mention hundreds ofnon-salaried appointments to departmental boards and advisory panelsat federal and state levels.   The top job appointments are presidential and require Senateapproval. As a general rule, the lower-level jobs are named by thesecretary of agriculture.   William J. Riley Jr., director of personnel for the departmentand its far-flung work force of about 106,000 full-time employees,said Wednesday in an interview that USDA has approximately 150political ``Schedule C'' and around 40 non-career Senior ExecutiveService jobs that are considered political appointments.   But Riley stressed that the numbers were approximate and that hehad no estimate of how many would be filled by holdovers from theReagan administration.   The jobs, he said, include state directors for the Farmers HomeAdministration and the state executive directors of the AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service.   About the time Bush took office on Jan. 20, Deputy SecretaryPeter Myers, who will be leaving, informed political job holdersthat they ``may or may not be maintained here'' by the newadministration and to prepare letters of resignation to be effectiveat the pleasure of the new secretary, Riley said.   ``As people are found to make replacements, the existing ScheduleCs may either be retained in their jobs or their resignationsaccepted,'' he said. ``But there is nothing in large, largenumbers.''   Riley was asked about reports that other departments had issued``pink slips'' to many political job holders and that April 1 wasthe deadline for departure.   ``No, not at Agriculture,'' he said. ``Some of them have alreadyleft and some will be leaving prior to the first of April, and I'msure some of them will be here after that.''   Riley was also asked about rumors that up to 150 potential newjob holders had been put on USDA's payroll as a reserve, squirreledaway to fill openings as they become available.   ``There have been some people who have been brought on board,obviously, but 150 people `squirreled away' is about 600 percenthigher than the actual figure,'' he said. ``We've brought onapproximately 25 people. In an administration change, that's asmall, small number.''   Riley said he preferred to think of the shift from Reagan to Bushas evolutionary, not revolutionary.   ``When you have an evolution, it's a lot slower and moreprofessional _ and it's a lot less bloody than a revolution,'' hesaid.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If catfish farming is a fast-growing businessin some parts of the United States, can snail ranching be farbehind? Perhaps not if enterprising producers take a hint from theAgriculture Department.   ``Don't be fooled by their fancy French name, escargots,'' saysthe department's Foreign Agricultural Service. ``Many of the snailsthe French eat aren't French at all. Instead they hail from suchcountries as Greece, Turkey, Indonesia and Czechoslovakia.''   It's possible that U.S. snails could corner a share of themarket, the agency said in AgExporter magazine.   The French consume as much as 40,000 metric tons of snailsannually, and domestic production can't keep up with demand, thereport said. In 1987, for example, 7,681 tons were imported, ornearly a fifth of yearly use.   More than three-fourths of the imports are fresh, frozen orrefrigerated. Canned snails represent about 2 percent of the total,with other processed snails making up the remainder.   ``There is no duty on fresh frozen or refrigerated snail imports,but a 20 percent ad valorem duty is applied to all imports that areprepared or preserved,'' the report said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department is proposing achange in federal regulations so that swine from China can beimported in 1989 for research purposes.   The change would include procedures so that the department'sAgricultural Research Service can import the Chinese hogs, officialssaid Wednesday. The changes, or protocol, could be used later byother importers.   Under the plan, the Chinese swine would have to undergo extensivequarantine at the department's animal import center in Key West,Fla., to be sure the animals are free of disease, includingfoot-and-mouth disease, which is present in China.   After quarantine, the swine will be released to the USDA agency,Iowa State University and the University of Illinois. Bycrossbreeding U.S. swine with the Chinese animals, researchers hopeto improve the productivity of the American pork industry.</TEXT></DOC>
