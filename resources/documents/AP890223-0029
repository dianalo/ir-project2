SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush's ethics commission says topofficials in all three branches of government should curtail theiroutside income, stop taking speaking fees, resign from corporateboards and disclose more of their personal finances.   In its third meeting, the eight-member panel on Wednesdaytentatively backed some of the toughest new rules and laws it hassuggested to date. If adopted, however, the recommendations wouldfall most heavily on Congress, because panel members repeatedlyopted for applying already stiffer executive branch standards to allof government.   The commission's final recommendations are due on Bush's deskMarch 9.   The mood of the session was captured by chairman Malcolm R.Wilkey in a comment about banning corporate board memberships. Vicechairman Griffin Bell, the former attorney general, pointed out thatjudges have been allowed for 25 years to remain on the board offamily-owned corporations.   Wilkey, former federal appellate judge, replied, ``It has to bechanged. A man just has to decide whether he wants to be a judge ornot. That rule fit the ethos of 25 years ago but not now.''   Both Wilkey and Bell recently persuaded Bush's chief ethicsadviser, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, to resign as boardchairman of his family-owned communications company.   The panel agreed that senior officials of all three branches ofgovernment should be barred from accepting fees for speeches andarticles whether or not they get a pay raise.   ``The evil of honoraria is so great from the appearance of aconflict of interest,'' said Bell, in proposing a ban on the fees.``People wonder who's paying all these honoraria. It underminesconfidence in government.''   All eight members agreed, though they debated and decided againstcoupling this recommendation with backing for a pay raise.   Under enormous public pressure, Congress recently voted down 50percent pay raises for the government's top officials. Thatrecommendation from the Quadrennial Commission and Presidents Reaganand Bush was coupled with a proposal that members of Congress stoptaking honoraria.   The only former congressman on the ethics panel, former Sen.Harrison Schmitt of New Mexico, said: ``As a practical matter thereis no way to divorce these issues from the salary issue. A salaryrecommendation has been made, but as we can all see it can't beimplemented.''   But former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler, who chaired theQuadrennial Commission, disagreed. ``Honoraria cannot be justifiedby saying that salaries are too low. Salaries should be dealt withdirectly.''   Chairman Malcolm R. Wilkey, a former federal appellate judge,summed up the consensus: ``The practice of honoraria has becomeevil. We'll let others deal with pay questions.''   This change, if adopted, would have a larger impact on Congressthan the executive branch. Executive branch rules already prohibitany honoraria for speeches or articles written about the area ofone's federal job, so very few are offered.   Members of Congress, however, may accept honoraria for speakingor writing on their congressional duties, and special interestgroups frequently give them large speaking fees. The House allowsmembers to receive honoraria up to 30 percent of salary and theSenate up to 40 percent of salary. Members of both houses are paid$89,500 a year.   The ethics panel also agreed that the total outside earned incomeof top officials in all three branches of government should belimited to 15 percent of salary. Again, this is the currentexecutive branch standard and is lower than that used in Congress.Bush has gone further, saying he wants his top officials to receiveno outside earned income.   On financial disclosure, the panel agreed to recommend morereporting than now required for liabilities and for large assets andincome. Members suggested an end to current exemptions fromreporting home mortgages and debts to relatives, with Bellcommenting: ``I'm more worried about what a man owes than what heowns.''   Panel members also agreed that officials should disclose whetherany of their assets are worth more than $1 million _ reporting nowcuts off after $250,000 _ and should disclose if their income ismore than $250,000, compared to the current top limit of $100,000.   At the same time, they recommended that smaller categories ondisclosure forms be consolidated somewhat. As Wilkey put thisquestion, ``What's the effective difference whether an asset isworth $5,000 to $15,000 or worth $15,000 to $50,000? Why not just$5,000 to $50,000?''   The panel agreed that membership by top officials on nonprofitboards should be subject to approval by ethics officers.   ``If I were the secretary of defense and I was on the Boy Scoutboard, they'd have more money than they know what to do with. I'dmake just 10 phone calls. The secretary of defense is toopowerful,'' Bell said.   The panel also agreed that the government should have a uniformrule on accepting lunches from businessmen and journalists. Panelmembers preferred the executive branch standard, which basicallybars acceptance of the free meals. The Senate allows its members toaccept meals under $50 while House members can accept those under$35.</TEXT></DOC>
