The producer of soft drinks and snack foods said it expects a decline in 1987 first-quarter per-share earnings because of dilution from recent acquisitions. For all of 1987, however, the company expects &quot;significant growth in earnings per share.&quot;    Strong sales of soft drinks and improved results from restaurants contributed to the company's higher fourth-quarter earnings. Net increased to $116.6 million, or 44 cents a share, from $89.3 million, or 33 cents a share, adjusted for a 3-for-1 stock split in May 1986. Year-earlier net included $15.7 million of losses from two discontinued operations, Wilson Sporting Goods and Lee Way Motor Freight, both of which have been sold. Thus, profit from continuing operations in the quarter was $116.6 million, up from $105 million a year earlier.    Sales rose 35% in the fourth quarter to $3.12 billion from $2.31 billion.    Wayne Calloway, chairman and chief executive officer, said that &quot;solid operating earnings gains&quot; are expected in the first quarter, with Frito-Lay, the company's biggest profit contributor, &quot;anticipating a healthy increase.&quot;    Fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations included a number of one-time items. Two one-time gains in the fourth quarter increased pre-tax profit by a total $44 million, including a $25 million gain from tax-benefit leases and $19 million from collecting a previously written-off receivable. There was a $52 million pre-tax charge against earnings relating to Frito-Lay's dropping certain snack products and reducing cookie-making capacity. Results also benefited from the inclusion of earnings of Kentucky Fried Chicken, acquired Oct. 1.    Pre-tax profit from soft-drink operations rose 31% on a 40% advance in sales for the quarter. Results were helped by the addition of MEI Corp., a major Pepsi bottler acquired in May, and sales gains by bottlers. U.S. bottler case sales increased 7%. Internationally, bottler case sales rose 5% but pre-tax earnings were off from the year before.    PepsiCo's restaurant business posted a 25% rise in pre-tax operating profit, including Kentucky Fried Chicken, with restaurant sales 67% ahead of a year earlier.    Snack-food earnings were hurt by a one-time charge at Frito-Lay related to discontinuing certain non-salty snack products and cutting cookie-making capacity.    For the full year, PepsiCo's net dropped 16% to $457.8 million, or $1.75 a share, on fewer shares outstanding, from $543.7 million, or $1.94 a share, adjusted for the 3-for-1 stock split. Year-earlier net includes profit of $123.6 million, or 44 cents a share, from the discontinued operations of North American Van Lines, a trucking concern that has been sold.    Sales for the year climbed 21% to $9.29 billion from $7.65 billion.    PepsiCo shares closed yesterday at $31, off 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
