Chase Econometrics puts GNP first-quarter growth at about a 2.5% annual pace, up from the paltry 1.1% in 1986's fourth quarter; Wharton Econometric Forecasting is somewhat more bullish. Both say inventory building will help offset sluggish consumer outlays and weak capital spending. White House economist Sprinkel sticks to his 3.2% prediction for the year.    Some suggest that tax reform is causing short-term weakness in business investment, consumer spending and commercial construction. National Association of Manufacturers economist Jerry Jasinowski sees a &quot;quite large&quot; negative effect for the first half of the year. But public and private forecasters say that most of the problems are only temporary.    Officials say the chief question remains the impact of the dollar's decline. &quot;Trade is our bottom line,&quot; says Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner.    BUSH STILL STUMBLES in the '88 race, while Hart dominates the Democrats.    A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows Bush's GOP support plummeting to 28% from 43% last August; Dole climbs to 23% from 10%. Bush's favorable ratings still exceed his negatives, but 54% of the public think that being Reagan's vice president has hurt his presidential prospects. His hopes of breaking out of his political doldrums were further damaged by a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview last weekend.    Democrat Hart, with 36%, has four times more support than his nearest competitor, Jesse Jackson; the poll shows Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis next with 5%. Among all voters, Hart beats both Bush and Dole and, by 41% to 36%, voters prefer a Democratic to a Republican president in 1988. But the Colorado Democrat's leftover debt from 1984 still plagues him.    WARMING TREND? The U.S. seeks a thaw with North Korea.    The recent decision to let U.S. diplomats talk to North Korean counterparts followed intelligence reports that Pyongyang wants to break out of its international isolation. The U.S. also feels pressure from China, which has improved its relations with Seoul and wants the U.S. to reciprocate.    Officials also hope to slow North Korea's recent moves toward the Soviets and reduce chances for an Olympic boycott. But South Korea balks at U.S. advice to respond more favorably to recent overtures. It fears that the north is only trying to foment domestic unrest through the peace noises.    &quot;We've warned the U.S. that it won't get anywhere with North Korea,&quot; says a South Korean official.    BOTTOMING OUT? Federal regulators say their list of problem banks, which grew by one a day in 1986, appears to be growing at about half that rate this year. But major troubles remain in the oil states, and FDIC Chairman Seidman says that a record 200 or more banks could go under this year.    MEESE'S TACTICS on judgeships draw fire from Senate GOP moderates. They complain he is dragging his feet and trying to see that only highly conservative candidates are named. Pennsylvania's Heinz complains to chief of staff Baker, so far without results. Some members also suspect Meese of torpedoing ex-Sen. Gorton's chances.    OFF AND RUNNING: The Brookings Institution's Robert Reischauer is the early favorite to head the Congressional Budget Office. But the search is on hold while Congress wrestles with the budget; other candidates under consideration include congressional aides Van Ooms and Edward Gramlich, Brookings's Joseph Pechman and Henry Aaron, and the Urban Institute's Isabel Sawhill.    WELFARE OVERHAUL faces stiff political struggles, despite bipartisan agreement that changes are needed. Divisions remain on such major issues as whether some welfare payments should be raised. The administration expects easier agreement on proposals to set work requirements, which liberals may accept if support services such as child care are included.    DEMOCRATS JOSTLE over trade with an eye on the presidential race.    Hart resists calls for protectionism; he opposed textile restrictions in the Senate last year and has signaled his refusal to embrace quotas. But other presidential aspirants seek to woo labor with tough talk. Biden would threaten to let the dollar slide, or even link trade to the presence of U.S. troops in Japan and Germany.    Babbitt, who once used National Guard troops in a mining strike, now proposes stiff tariffs for nations that don't reduce their trade surpluses. Dukakis doesn't favor tariffs but says the U.S. may have to resort to &quot;tough stuff&quot; sometimes. Gephardt hopes for a public fight over his stringent amendment to the Ways and Means trade bill.    Some say Gephardt's posturing hampers the panel's work. &quot;If he weren't running for president, it would be easier to deal with him,&quot; says Democratic Rep. Gibbons.    MINOR MEMOS: Bad news, worse news: New Hampshire GOP Sen. Rudman says polls in his state show that presidential hopeful Alexander Haig &quot;is unknown, but he has strong negatives.&quot; . . . Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott will perform with his old singing group, the Highwaymen, at a reunion concert. The group had a gold record in 1961, for &quot;Michael, Row the Boat Ashore.&quot; . . . Asked how to pay for extra spending proposals, Speaker Wright suggests a request to the Sultan of Brunei. </TEXT></DOC>
