Previous generationsof computer systems have been variations of the same architecture: vonNeumann style. A new generation is being developed, where a fundamentaldeparture from the direction of the traditional digital computer systemshas been focused. There are four major programs under way: the JapaneseIcot program, the Espirit initiative in the EEC, the Alvey program inthe UK, and the MCC and Darpa in the USA. The new generation of computersystems are based on parallel, distributed, and non-deterministic processingand symbolic manipulation. Artificial Intelligence applications playa key role in these systems; the interface between users and machineis performed by means of speech, natural languages, and pictures. Thetype of operations that the computer must execute are non-numeric (suchas symbolic manipulation).</TEXT></DOC>
