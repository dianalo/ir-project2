Last week's bungled Soviet coup sparked a fleeting plungein the Nasdaq Composite Index followed by a powerful surge inthe small-stock benchmark to three successive new highs. Therally may not be as strong as it seems, cautions ChristineCallies, a Boston-based technical analyst for Cowen andamp; Co. Inher view, even long-term investors who buy high-flying OTCleaders at these levels could be in trouble.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It could be quite hazardous if you buy and hold shareswhen the market is overbought,&quot; says Ms. Callies, using aterm coined by technical analysts to mean that stocks arepricey. &quot;With that as a caveat,&quot; she adds, &quot;I'd say that(smaller) stocks can be used to improve the performance of aportfolio, provided they are bought when they are down.&quot;   A growing number of public and private pension fundsindeed are spicing up their portfolios by putting a slice oftheir huge investments into small stocks -- and their buyingbodes well for a long-term rally in the group. Goodyear Tireandamp; Rubber Co., for example, recently searched for a manager of$50 million in small stocks; the Louisiana Employees'Retirement System is looking to invest $75 million in smallershares, and the Iowa Police System plans to bet $50 millionon small stocks.   But there are two clues, asserts Ms. Callies, that thissummer's small-stock rally is tiring. It has been led by theNasdaq 100, the 100 largest non-financial OTC stocks. That'sa sign that investors who expect a rise in OTC stocks daredto tread only among big issues they could sell on quicknotice.   The breadth of the rally also is narrowing, she adds.Monday, when word of the coup sparked a 2.9% plunge in theComposite Index, declining stocks swamped advancers, 6-to-1.Wednesday, when the coup failed and the index rebounded 3.2%to a record high, advancing stocks outweighed decliners byless than 4-to-1. And their advantage has been narrowingsince.   Small-stock investors, such as Rich Filippone of PiperJaffray Capital Management Inc. in Minneapolis, aren't afraidto reduce holdings in highfliers. Mr. Filippone recently soldabout one-third of his holdings in SciMed Life Systems, aMaple Grove, Minn., maker of medical devices whose shareshave more than quadrupled since September, and Buffets Inc.,a Minneapolis restaurant operator that has nearly tripledsince October.   Mr. Filippone and his colleague John Pauer have steeredthe $50 million Piper Jaffray Emerging Growth Fund to a 42%rise this year. They look for companies whose earnings aregrowing at 25% a year or more -- far faster than thecompanies in Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index. They alsoprefer companies with little debt that are dominant in theirmarkets and make products that aren't sensitive torecessions, such as Minntech, a Minneapolis maker of kidneydialysis equipment and medical supplies.   And they aren't shy about buying stocks that trade at morethan 25 times expected earnings for the following year -- ifthey're convinced the earnings growth can be sustained. &quot;Ifwe expect a company to grow 25% a year for the next fewyears, it deserves a multiple at 25 or above,&quot; says Mr.Filippone. But once the multiple reaches more than 1.5 timesa company's expected growth rate, &quot;then we pull back,&quot; headds.   They also look for companies that reduce the cost ofbusiness of other companies, such as Centex Telemanagement, aSan Francisco manager of telecommunications equipment andusage. At Friday's close of 14 3/4, Centex trades at 23 timesestimated 1991 earnings of 64 cents a share and nearly 18times expected 1992 earnings of 84 cents -- below itsexpected growth rate of 31%.   Taking a different approach to small-stock investing isKen Fisher, president of Fisher Investments Inc. of Woodside,Calif. As a so-called &quot;value&quot; investor, Mr. Fisher looks forthe shares of promising companies that trade near their bookvalues, at relatively low multiples of earnings and atdiscounts compared with the highfliers. (The recent highs ofNasdaq's big stocks signal to Mr. Fisher that so-calledgrowth stocks are getting pricey.)   There are plenty of interesting, reasonably priced sharesto chose from, Mr. Fisher says. Valmont Industries, forexample, is a Valley, Neb., company with an unusual mix ofbusinesses -- it makes irrigation systems, but also sellsmicrocomputers -- that he says has kept Wall Street wary ofthe stock. At Friday's close of 14 3/4, Valmont sells at just1.5 times its book value, 13 times estimated 1991 earnings of$1.10 a share provided by First Call, a unit of ThomsonFinancial Networks, and nine times expected 1992 earnings of$1.60 a share -- just the multiples that attract Mr. Fisher.   Standard Register, a Dayton, Ohio, maker of paper forms,is another overlooked company, he adds. &quot;Nobody likes forms-- they think they'll get wiped out by computers,&quot; Mr. Fishersays, &quot;but paper doesn't go away.&quot; He expects cost-cuttingmeasures to boost the company's lagging earnings, whichrecently disappointed analysts. At Friday's close of 14 1/8,Standard Register sells at 1.3 times book value, 13 timesestimated 1991 earnings of $1.06 a share and 11.5 timesexpected 1992 earnings of $1.22 a share.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks jumped to another closing highamid signs of surprising strength in the economy.   The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 2.76 to 521.06, a 0.53%gain, spurred on by a report that factory orders of durablegoods jumped a surprising 10.7% in July. Advancing stocksoutweighed decliners, 1,089 to 850, as National Market Systemvolume climbed to 123.3 million shares from 118.7 millionThursday.   Despite the day's rise, the most active OTC stocks weremixed as some investors cashed in profits from some recentgainers: Apple Computer fell 1 1/4 to 53, Dell Computer eased7/8 to 34 3/8 and Charming Shoppes fell 1 7/8 to 22 1/4.Intel, however, rose 1/4 to 50 1/4, Sun Microsystems climbed7/8 to 33, Tele-Communications Class A shares added 3/8 to 135/8 and U.S. Healthcare gained 3/8 to 31.   Vans, a newly public maker of tennis shoes, was the day'smost active OTC issue after an offering of 4.1 million sharesat $14 apiece. Vans closed at 15 on more than 4.4 millionshares.   Microsoft jumped 1 1/4 to 85 1/4 after the SoftwarePublishers Association, a Washington, D.C., trade group,reported that sales of Microsoft's Windows software more thantripled in the second quarter.   Medstat Systems, an Ann Arbor, Mich., provider of softwaresystems that help control medical costs, surged 4 to 37 1/2.The stock was favorably profiled Friday as Investor's Daily&quot;Stock of the Week,&quot; after the company's announcement Mondayof a long-term contract to license data management softwareto Prudential Insurance Co. of America.   Synergen jumped 3 7/8 to 48 7/8 after a Business Weekarticle cited favorable expectations concerning the company'sdrug products.   After a one-point drop Thursday, Mentor Graphics rebounded3/4 to 12 3/4. The Wilsonville, Ore., maker of computer-aideddesign products announced a 15% cut in its work force andsaid that it will take a &quot;significant&quot; charge in the thirdquarter for restructuring costs.   Puritan-Bennett gained 1 to 29 3/4. Thursday, the OverlandPark, Kan., medical products concern said that it receivedclearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market asystem that monitors blood gases.   Bioplasty, on the other hand, fell 1 3/8 to 6 3/8. The FDAsaid it didn't have enough information to review data aboutthe safety and effectiveness for three types of siliconbreast implants -- including one that Bioplasty alreadysells. The product accounted for about 24% of the St. Paul,Minn., company's revenue in the most recent fiscal quarter.The FDA accepted for further review applications by Bioplastyfor two other products.   Williams-Sonoma shed 1 to 21 1/2. The San Franciscoretailer of home furnishings and cooking equipment reported asecond-quarter loss of three cents a share, compared with netincome of five cents a year earlier. Analysts had expectedthe company to report a small profit.</TEXT></DOC>
