It's in Canada, and it's natural gas, lots of it. If Amoco's proposed $4 billion purchase of Dome Petroleum Ltd. finally gets approval next month as Amoco expects, it will make the company the richest holder of natural gas reserves in North America.    It's a distinction that few oil companies have been racing to claim. While oil prices have been falling, natural gas prices have been falling even further. But industry officials hope that because more gas currently is being produced than discovered, eventually -- maybe even soon -- the price will go up.    &quot;The future is gas,&quot; says Ted Eck, Amoco's chief economist. &quot;We've got more gas than oil -- Amoco, the U.S., North America. Anybody who is really honest with himself has to admit we're really running out of oil.&quot;    Because much of the oil in the U.S. has already been sucked out of the ground, most oil companies are slowly but surely becoming gas companies too. Mobil Corp., for instance, has just started producing natural gas from a huge field off the Alabama coast in Mobile Bay. Chevron Corp. has also renewed its interest in natural gas, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico.    But Amoco is the leader of the pack in this move, and its natural gas operation is already benefiting from technological innovations introduced in its oil sector. After the Dome acquisition is completed, Amoco's reserves will be roughly 52% natural gas and 48% oil, compared with 40% gas and 60% oil 10 years ago.    As Amoco becomes more gas-focused, half its capital spending over the next five years will go outside the U.S. During the past 20 years, only a third of this spending went abroad.    Several years ago, Amoco's strategy was to own more acreage than anyone else. An Amoco well could be found in any big oil and gas basin in the U.S.    &quot;We used to be everywhere,&quot; says Patrick J. Early, president of Amoco Production Co., the exploration and production unit. But by the early 1980s, lower oil prices had prompted Amoco to sell marginal domestic properties and become more selective. And when oil prices crashed in 1986, Amoco slashed its exploration budget more quickly and more harshly than many of its competitors.    That move was typical of the straight-shooting Midwest company. Natural gas pipeline companies consider Amoco the most ferocious negotiator in the take-or-pay gas disputes that have exposed pipeline operators to billions of dollars in liabilities. &quot;It's a reputation that's been won by a tremendous amount of hard work,&quot; Mr. Early says.    Just a few years ago, when gas prices were triple their current levels, pipelines made long-term commitments to take the gas from producers such as Amoco on expectations prices would keep going up. Prices did just the opposite, pipeline companies wanted out of their contracts, and oil companies have been jamming settlements down their throats ever since. Why be so tough on pipelines? &quot;Why not?&quot; Mr. Early answers.    It's not just their lawyers who are tough; their people in the field are, too. Smelling weakness among the battered companies that supply offshore drilling rigs -- an industry with an enormous oversupply -- Amoco developed a vicious reputation.    &quot;They've been brutal with those guys,&quot; says an official of an oil-service company. There are stories in the field that Amoco will fire a rig contractor that had the nerve to ask for even a tiny rate increase, he says.    Again, Mr. Early acknowledges the general attitude. &quot;We got tough with our costs as early as anybody,&quot; he says. But Amoco also has developed a written policy that tells its field operators to judge a service contractor on the value of his services, not just the price.    Yet, for all its toughness, Amoco has an openness that many applaud. Ask for nonproprietary data from Exxon Corp., industry people say, and the company will tell you to put your request in writing. Ask Texaco Inc., and it will say it's not doing anything interesting. &quot;Amoco -- you call them up and they'll invite you over for a cup of coffee&quot; and help out, says Richard Spears, a consultant with Spears andamp; Associates Inc. in Tulsa, Okla.    Amoco's innovation and perseverance in the oil business has usually paid off. In the Wertz field in Wyoming, for instance, its $150 million enhanced oil recovery project uses complex, costly technology that only a few major companies have held on to since the price collapse. But by injecting carbon dioxide into the ground, the company currently forces out more oil a day than the field ever has produced in its 40-year history.    But even without Dome, Amoco is already more of a gas company than an oil company. Amoco recently drilled a handful of wells in a new area called the Arkoma basin, a thin strip straddling the Oklahoma-Arkansas border. Two medium-sized gas wells are already producing, and two others look even more promising, Amoco says.    The company seems to believe that technology will give it an edge in gas exploration and development as it has in oil. To pull as much gas out of the ground as it can, Amoco has drilled 200 wells around San Juan, N.M., in a project that began in 1974 to get gas off the surface of coal.    &quot;They are extremely plodding and careful, but they are going to outlast other marathon runners,&quot; says Bernard Picchi, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.    Amoco's oil and gas exploration and production, or &quot;upstream,&quot; operations have been overshadowed recently by the company's record-setting chemical business and robust gasoline refining and marketing unit. In the first quarter, Amoco's refining and marketing and chemical operations outperformed the rest of the company, showing a profit of $275 million while upstream operations earned $209 million. &quot;Downstream&quot; operations are expected to post stellar results for the second quarter as well. But in the long run, upstream is what counts.    In Dome, Amoco is paying the going rate for about 212 million barrels of oil and three trillion cubic feet of gas -- a relatively small amount of proven reserves for a company Amoco's size. The real attraction of Dome lies in 11.4 million undeveloped acres that could have enough reserves to last for decades. Amoco is betting that future discoveries will make the purchase a bargain. But it will take at least three years of exploratory drilling before the company knows whether the gamble paid off.    Amoco officials won't talk much about Dome at this point, noting that Canada's courts have yet to clear the transaction. But at the recent annual meeting, Vice Chairman James W. Cozad told Amoco holders the undeveloped acreage could be &quot;the paramount feature&quot; of the merger.    The company's explorers hope to start drilling almost the minute the deal is done. Amoco has said it's not sure how much it will find, but industry officials and consultants point out that Amoco was a partner in a lot of Dome projects, so it must have a fairly good idea what's out there.    ---                 Amoco Earnings by Segment                  In millions of dollars                                    Refining,                 Exploration        Marketing                         and              and                  Production   Transportation   Chemical    1983              $1,773             $ 28       $113    1984               1,906              123        211    1985               1,550              262        195    1986                 193              362        261    1987                 800              216        427    NOTE: Excludes small losses from several operations.</TEXT></DOC>
