The vote on limiting debate on the cut, which President Bushproposed, was 51-47. Republicans will get another try to limitdebate Wednesday. If that fails, the issue will be put to rest forthe year.   Leaders of both parties have said no reduction is likely thisyear. Tuesday's debate was set up to give backers of acapital-gains cut the chance to show their strength.   ``This is a situation where everyone gains,'' said Sen. BobPackwood, R-Ore., contending that a tax cut would benefit investorswhile producing increased revenue for the government to spend onsocial programs. ``You don't get many deals better than that.''   Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, who has ledopposition to a capital-gains cut, said that in the long term, theproposal would worsen the budget deficit by tens of billions ofdollars. ``This amendment symbolizes the excesses of the lastdecade, especially the unprecedented irresponsibiity in federalfiscal policy.   ``This is budget fraud that is astonishing in its audacity andirresponsiblity,'' Mitchell said. ``This amendment is designed todo one thing ... only: Give President Bush a political victory nomatter what the long-term cost to the American people.''   Bush campaigned last year on a pledge to cut taxes on capitalgains, which are profits from the sale of investments. He said acut would spur investment and job creation.   Democrats generally are opposed, arguing that 80 percent of thebenefit of a reduction would go to those with incomes of more than$100,000 a year.   The proposed reduction has been the dominant point of contentionbetween Congress and the president this year. The House, withsignificant Democratic support, approved a capital-gains cut inSeptember.   Before 1986, only 40 percent of capital gains from propertyowned more than one year was taxable. Since that time, capitalgains have been fully taxable at the same rates applied to otherincome.   Packwood's amendment also included a provision, written by Sen.Bill Roth, R-Del., to create a new type of Individual RetirementAccount that, at least for a few years, would help pay for thecapital-gains cut.   Under the Republican amendment, the longer an asset was held,the less of the profit from its sale would be taxed.   Thus, only 95 percent of the profit from the sale of an assetowned more than one year would be taxed. That percentage wouldincrease by five points for each additional year up to seven; only65 percent of the gain would be taxed when property owned more thanseven years is sold.   The GOP plan for expanding IRAs would use a different approachthan was used by more than 15 million when deductible IRAs wereopen to all workers. The old-style IRA, which now is restricted tolower-income workers and those not covered by a company pension,permits a tax deduction for the maximum $2,000-a-year contribution.   The Packwood-Roth amendment would permit workers to set aside upto $2,000 a year but receive no tax deduction. Instead, interest onthe account would never be taxed. In addition, penalty-freewithdrawals could be made from the IRA to pay medical or educationexpenses or for retirement.   Workers would be permitted to to convert their currenttax-deductible IRAs into the new accounts by paying tax oncontributions that had been deducted in the past. Packwood and Rothcited estimates that these ``rollovers'' would produce enoughrevenue for the government to pay for the cut in capital-gainstaxes.   The capital-gains cut passed by the House contained no changesin IRAs. Until 1992, it would exclude 30 percent of gains fromtaxation. After that, only the portion of gains attributable toinflation would be excluded.</TEXT></DOC>
