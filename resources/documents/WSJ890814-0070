Grand Met said it would invest A$50 million ($38.2 million) in Harlin, a closely held company controlled by Elders executives, to help finance the A$3-a-share bid.    Separately, Grand Met's Pillsbury Co. said it sold its Van de Kamp's Frozen Seafoods unit to Chicago-based Whitman Corp. for $140 million.    The decision to join Harlin's bid for Elders is in line with Grand Met's position as a major marketer of Elders's Foster's Lager in Britain and the U.S.    A Grand Met spokesman said the investment would give the company a &quot;nominal&quot; stake in Harlin, though he wasn't able to provide an exact figure.    Harlin currently owns about 18% of Elders. </TEXT></DOC>
