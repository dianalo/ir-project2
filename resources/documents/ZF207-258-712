(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A BUDDING RELATIONSHIPandM;Love at first sight?andP;  Not by a long shot.andM;If anything, the blossoming relationship between AI and DBMS has weathered astory past.andP;  Not long ago these two stars had only a scornful tolerance foreach other--which often bordered on outright antagonism.andM;This early, mutual disregard is fairly understandable considering theirdifferent backgrounds.andP;  After all, AI came from the esoteric, Ph.D.-typehallowed halls of academia.andP;  DBMS, on the other hand, came from hard-working,white-collar, middle class roots.andM;There were times when databased management systems considered AI an arrogantsnob, a prima donna--or worse.andP;  And at times, AI considered DBMS to be in theuntouchable caste--if it bothered to give DBMS a thought at all.andM;Little by little, things are changing.andP;  They are looking at each other from anew point of view.andM;The budding romance has also aroused the interest of many observers.andM;Author and consultant James Martin, known worldwide for his data processingbooks, seminars and videotapes, approves.andP;  &quot;There are many ways we need tobring these two technologies together,&quot; says Martin.andP;  &quot;It's a very importantcombination.&quot;andM;But there are lots of questions to be answered before the relationship getstoo serious.andM;Will they be able to talk to each other?andP;  Will they even understand what theother one is saying?andM;AI's discourse includes topics like higher levels of abstraction, heuristics,loose and tight coupling, and knowledge paradigms.andM;DBMS talks about fairly similar things, but uses terms like top-down views,rules, integration techniques and schemas.andM;But are they compatible?andP;  Will the combination of AI expert systems and DBMSget beyond the current architectures of loose coupling and tight coupling tothe projected vision of &quot;expert database systems&quot;?andP;  And can AI's knowledgebases meet the stringent performance requirements needed by DBMS in aproduction environment?andM;Do they really need each other?andP;  Why do they need each other?andP;  Who needs theother the most?andM;ADVANTAGESandM;Some say that DBMS would benefit the most--allowing it to solve existingproblems and enhance current capabilities.andP;  Others say that AI would benefitthe most--permitting it to learn from DBMS's commercial experience and gainenough industrial strength to survive in the corporate marketplace.andM;There are many advantages that AI offers to DBMS.andP;  AI can assist withproviding natural language interfaces, help with data modeling and internalschema generation, and facilitate query optimization.andM;In the growing area of heterogeneous, distributed databases, AI techniquescan help users to locate the needed data with smart dictionary and directorycapabilities.andM;On the other hand, DBMS has an impressive dowry.andP;  AI knowledge bases wouldprofit if they had the speed and flexibility of databases.andP;  In fact, AIknowledge bases would gain significantly by incorporating many of thequalities that DBMSs have acquired over the years.andP;  The age and wide-rangingexperiences of DBMS are definite advantages.andM;&quot;Many of AI's knowledge bases need data that is in existing databases,&quot; saysMartin.andP;  &quot;Most corporations have an enormous amount of data which seems justgolden for analysis by AI techniques.&quot;andM;To seize this opportunity, AI's most qualified representative is expertsystem technology.andP;  While pattern-matching and neural networks hold a lot ofpromise, expert systems are delivering today--and in a big way.andM;There are many different definitions of expert systems.andP;  Basically, an expertsystem ia a piece of software which contains expertise about a particulararea.andP;  The expertise is usually acquired from humans, but can also beobtained from procedural manuals, textbooks, policy guidelines and othersources.andM;The expertise is stored in the knowledge base of the expert system--often inthe form of if-then rules.andM;An expert system also has an inference engine which is the reasoningcomponent.andP;  An inference engine consists of a set of procedures which examinethe knowledge base to answer a problem or make a decision.andM;The inference engine is the &quot;thinking it through&quot; part of the expert system.andO;Inferencing approaches include foreward-chaining, backward-chaining,combinations of both and other techniques.andM;The first generation of expert systems appeared in the early 1980s.andP;  Mostwere standalone systems that were written in Lisp and could only operate onspecial hardware.andP;  Like esoteric poets secluded in an ivory tower, theyimpressed MIS as talented, but aloof and irrelevant.andM;These first-generation systems are history now--their advances scorned byMIS.andP;  The first generation includes ART from inference Corp., Los Angeles,KEE from Intellicorp, Mountain View, Calif and S.1 from Teknowledge Inc.,andO;Palo alto, Calif.andM;But today, expert systems are back at DBMS's door, clothed in a brand-newwardrobe and sporting a friendlier, more cooperative attitude.andM;The new second-generation expert systems are making a conscious effort tolive in a world with production-oriented DBMS and MIS.andP;  The new expertsystems can reside on conventional hardware under traditional operatingsystems and teleprocessing monitors.andP;  They can call and be called byproduction systems, and can mix well with IMS, Vsam, DB2 and many otherdatabase systems.andM;Some practitioners are taking existing production systems, written in Cobolor other languages, and embedding expert system rules into them.andP;  The expertsystem enhances the existing program by adding additional, new capabilities.andM;Others are designing new systems from scratch to take advantage of the uniquecapabilities each technology offers.andP;  Programmers using existing techniquescan be proficient in producing procedural code.andM;Expert systems, on the other hand, excel with rule-based, declarativestatements.andP;  (See Case article on inference-based development p.46.)andM;AMERICAN EXPRESS SAVES MILLIONSandM;An excellent example of adding expert system technology to an existing systemis the American Express Authorizer Assistant (AA) System.andM;It cost several million dollars to get these two technologies together atAmerican Express, but it saves the company $27 million a year.andM;Before AI, a human authorizer at American Express was presented with up to 16screens of information related to the credit-worthiness of a creditapplicant.andP;  The human credit authorizer had only seconds to evaluate all thisdata while the customer and merchant--miles away--wait for approval.andM;The complication for American Express is that they do not impose a creditlimit on their card holders.andP;  With a credit limit, the decisions are simple.andO;A computer program adds the new purchase amount to the previous balance andcompares it to the credit limit.andP;  When the credit limit is exceeded, thecomputer program declines the purchase.andM;It is far more complex without a credit limit.andP;  Many things have to beconsidered.andP;  Many judgments have to be made.andP;  And American Express does notwant to say &quot;no.&quot;andP;  The company makes money by extending credit, not denyingit.andM;In addition, it does not want to alienate customers and merchants.andP;  However,it is important to avoid the cost of bad loans.andM;An American Express customer is never denied credit by a computer.andP;  Many ofthe approvals are granted automatically by the originally coded proceduralprogram.andP;  But some require additional judgment that the procedural codecannot perform.andP;  In the old system, a human advisor was immediately alertedand presented with massive amounts of data from diverse, heterogeneousdatabases--and asked to make lightning-quick decisions that have criticallyimportant ramifications.andM;The recently-added AI technology incorporates the reasoning capabilities andjudgment skills of the best human credit authorizers into an expert system.andO;That expertise is applied to all of the data that was previously presented inthe 16 screens to the human advisor.andM;The expert system evaluates the data and presents one screen to the humanadvisor with its recommendations.andP;  Additional new screens are provided to thehuman advisor to obtain an explanation of the reasoning process, question thedetermination, or take a better look at the information personally.andP;  AmericanExpress says the efficiency of its credit advisors has improved considerably.andM;Many commercial data processing systems have been enhanced by this techniqueof embedding an expert system into an existing production system.andM;LOOSE/TIGHT COUPLINGandM;The various approaches to combining these two technologies are often calledloose coupling and tight coupling--at least that is what AI calls them.andP;  Andbecause AI is making an attempt to fit into the real world, DBMS is trying tounderstand the language of AI.andM;&quot;Loose coupling is when you have two absolutely separate software programs,&quot;explains Steve Oxman, co-author with James Martin of Building Expert Systems:A Tutorial, Prentice Hall, englewood Cliffs, N.J.andP;  &quot;For example, one programis an expert system an the other one does database work.&quot;andM;Oxman's consulting company, Oxko Corp., wrote an expert system module to beloosely coupled with KnowledgeWare's Action Diagrammer.andP;  &quot;They are eachseparate programs,&quot; Oxman remarked.andM;Using Oxko's application, the session opens up with a call to a Level 5expert system from Information Builders, New York.andP;  There is an interactiveconsultation during which the end user tells the system what to do.andM;&quot;Level 5 then passes information to Action Diagrammer, which takes controluntil the end of the session.andP;  That's loosely coupled,&quot; Oxman said.andM;Martin says &quot;loose coupling is the technique that is in most widespread usetoday.andP;  This is the situation where people have built expert systems toretrieve information from an existing database.&quot;andM;The expert system remains a distinctly separate component from the databaseand the existing application program.andP;  They communicate through calling eachother and passing information.andM;Tightly coupled involves integrating separate modules, Oxman said.andM;With tight coupling, the two technologies are more closely integrated, butthey are still not a unified, cohesive whole.andP;  The knowledge base componentis still a separate entity from the database component.andM;OTHER EXPRESSIONS, TERMSandM;Various expressions and terms that try to provide a new name for the marriageof these two technologies are emerging.andP;  The most common are expert databasesystems, knowledge base systems and logic database systems.andP;  But even thesame term can mean something quite different when used by different people.andM;In general, these terms refer to a new type of structure that will beachieved through the synergy of these two technologies.andP;  In this newstructure--some researchers project--the knowledge base and the database willbe one entity.andM;But is that possible, considering the two types of entities are quitedissimilar?andM;Databases usually consist of a collection of records--each with fieldscontaining alphanumeric values.andP;  Individual fields are accessed because ofthe need to determine the value in that particular field.andM;Knowledge bases consist of facts, rules or heuristics.andP;  Examples of factsare: &quot;cash is an asset&quot; and &quot;investory is an asset.&quot; Examples of rules are:&quot;if x has hair, then x is a mammal&quot; and &quot;if x gives milk, then x is amammal.&quot;andM;What type of access mechanism or reasoning engine could use both fields andrules?andP;  Would they be mixed together?andP;  How would one do that?andM;THE SEARCH GOES ONandM;These questions have not been answered yet.andP;  The effort to create one unifiedentity continues because there is no product on the commercial market thatoffers that today.andM;&quot;So far, it's been a complete failure,&quot; says Oxman.andP;  &quot;There are technologyproblems that nobody has solved.andM;&quot;With an expert system, you might sequentially read 100% of the knowledgebase every time through.andP;  You might do that because you want to guaranteethat every possible pattern that could match against your point of interestis checked.andP;  So, you would do a 100% check every time,&quot; says Oxman.andM;To do that with a database as the repository is incredibly inefficient, hepoints out.andM;According to Ernie Hughes, an independent consultant and professor inSeattle, &quot;A lot of progress is being made in university research with logicdatabases.andM;&quot;Michael Stonebraker at the University of California at Berkeley has a systemcalled Postgress, which is an enhanced version of their Ingres relationalresearch,&quot; says Hughes.andP;  Jeffrey Ullman at Stanford describes logic as a datamodel in his recent book, Database and Knowledge-Base Systems, ComputerScience Press, Rockville, Md.andM;Certainly a great deal of progress is being made in combining AI techniqueswith databases in other ways.andP;  (See the sidebar on how to combine AI andDBMS.)andM;Some ways that AI is being used with conventional databases is with patternmatching techniques which reveal new knowledge from existing data.andO;Object-oriented database approaches are providing database technicians withnew ways to represent complex data types.andM;Natural language interfaces, a prominent offspring of AI, are having a hugesuccess collaborating with DBMSs.andP;  They are being used as a front-end queryprocessor for databases.andP;  The first such tool for the IBM mainframe wasIntellect, from AICorp.andP;  of Waltham, Mass.andM;&quot;The engineers are falling in love with the natural language and databaseprototype that we have up and running,&quot; says Pranab Baruah, a Seattle-basedAI specialist working in the commercial marketplace.andP;  Baruah uses Intellectas a query interpreter for an 11Gb engineering database.andM;Baruah's application dramatically increases an engineer's ability to getinformation.andM;&quot;The data is so complex that to link all of the necessary informationtogether the engineers were required to create very complex queries,&quot; saysBaruah.andP;  &quot;Before Intellect, they used to come to MIS people and ask them todevelop an application for each query.&quot;andM;Easytalk, Intelligent Business Systems' (IBS) new product, combines the bestfeatures of natural language, expert systems, and relational databasetechnology.andP;  Easytalk operates on DEC VAXs with Oracle from Oracle Corp.,andO;Belmont, Calif.andM;&quot;The business problem we set out to solve,&quot; says Steven Shwartz, founder andsenior vice president of advanced development at Intelligent BusinessSystems, Milford, Conn., &quot;is that ther is a lot of data stored in corporatedatabases.andP;  But that data is not easily available to the end user.andP;  There are75,000 decision support systems today.andP;  We spend $6 billion trying to getdata out of databases.&quot;andM;Robert Vonderhaar, assistant vice president of marketing for IBS, says,&quot;Easytalk stores the knowledge of database administrators.andP;  This knowledgeincludes the awareness of what data is 'raw', what data is derived, whichdata is redundant, as well as other database administrator-type knowledge.&quot;andM;An expert system can replicate the reasoning process of databaseadministrators in many ways.andP;  For example, the knowledge of where specificdata is located could be contained in a knowledge base.andM;An expert system in the form of a smart data dictionary or directory couldguide an end user to where the required data is located in a heterogeneous ordistributed environment.andM;A smart query interpreter could contain an end-user profile so it wouldunderstand that while the abbreviation &quot;rev&quot; means re-entry vehicle to theengineer, it can most likely be interpreted as revenue to the financemanager.andM;Other types of database administrator knowledge that could be stored arelogical and physical design decisions and proper disk utilization.andM;&quot;We can store those heuristics--rules of thumb--about the efficiency for thedifferent physical drives and map that to heuristics on what is maintainablefrom a particular DBMS's point of view.andP;  We put all those heuristics togetherin a computer program called an expert system, to help you with your physicalDBMS implementation design.andP;  And that is incredibly doable,&quot; Oxman said.andM;AI, PC, MAINFRAME COOPERATINGandM;Products incorporating this kind of expertise are beginning to appear.andP;  TheDASD Advisor from Boole andamp; Babbage, Sunnyvale, Calif., combines DBA knowledgewith data center management expertise to help manage DASD configuration.andM;The AI and DBMS duet is making a tremendous contribution in the area ofdeveloping database applications.andP;  In fact, these two partners areharmonizing well on the dual platforms of PCs and mainframes in the Casespectrum.andP;  The blend of mainframe and PC technology--using each one for whatit is best-suited within one application--is increasingly referred to ascooperative processing.andM;Using AI techniques for database application development in a cooperativeprocessing environment permits integrity checking at two levels.andM;On the PC level, it lets a solitary developer check the interrelatedness ofall the diagrams developed on a particular PC.andP;  On the mainframe level, itensures that the work of an individual developer is coordinated with the workdone by the rest of the development team.andM;The computer-aided software engineering (Case) tools of KnowledgeWare, Inc.andO;of Atlantic, have a large amount of rule processing both in PC and mainframedatabase information engineering tools.andP;  KnowledgeWare's InformationEngineering Workbench product is an integrated Case tool.andP;  The company's PCknowledge coordinator is connected to its central mainframe coordinator tointegrate development work performed on both platforms.andM;KnowledgeWare's integrated environment provides a planning workbench, ananalysis workbench, a design workbench and a construction workbench--as wellas a code generator.andM;These workbenches enable people to enter very complex information.andO;KnowledgeWare coordinates and controls all the information, checking it foraccuracy.andP;  It makes sure that each fact fits in with every other fact--manyof which come from the diagrams on the screen.andM;Combinations of AI and DBMS technology like this can result in spectacularincreases in application quality and productivity.andM;Martin describes the evolution of database application development approachesand the increasing importance of artificial intelligence techniques.andM;There is no doubt that the growing relationship between these twotechnologies can benefit everything it touches.andM;What about the performance issue?andM;Like any performance situation, this is a relative matter.andP;  There will alwaysbe applications where split-second response is not required; and otherapplications where the expert system meets the needs of the end user.andM;Speed is sufficient in the PC-based expert systems that Oxman builds forclients.andP;  Oxman said that after experimenting with many expert system shells,his company does nearly all of its expert system development with InformationBuilder's Level 5.andM;&quot;We run expert systems as fast as Pascal or anything else,&quot; says Oxman.andO;&quot;Performance is not an issue.andP;  You can't hit the keys fast enough to keep upwith the inference engine.&quot;andM;On mainframes, not only is the performance issue relative to the productionapplication involved, there is something more important involved.andM;&quot;You can build certain types of applications, sometimes very complexapplications, quite fast with some of the expert system shells,&quot; says Martin.andO;&quot;Once you see that it works, you can say, 'OK, let's go into that and haveprocedural code so we can make it more machine-efficient.'andM;&quot;There are lots of applications which have been built with shells whichalmost certainly would never have been created if people had to do them inCobol or PL/1 or C,&quot; Martin said.andM;So there are many areas within database technology where AI can assist DBMS.andO;It is already helping DBMS with new applications, creations and needs.andM;Recently, Congress passed IRS Section 89.andP;  Its intent is to ensure thathighly compensated employees do not receive an extraordinary high percentageof a company's fringe benefits.andP;  Information buried deep within DBMSs canhelp determine this.andP;  (The IRS requires compliance this year.)andM;AI is the perfect partner to support DBMS in this time of need.andP;  Expertsystems can quickly be developed using inference-based data processing toexamine all the data held in DBMS's inner recesses.andP;  AI will be able to helpDBMS meet the demands of the IRS when due.andM;In fact, according to Gerald Wilson, founder of Quantum InKnowvations, SantaClara, Calif., Nova Expert Systems of Palo Alto, Calif., developed a systemto respond to IRS Section 89 using Quantum's ProGenesis expert systemssoftware.andM;It looks like an important and mutually beneficial relationship isdeveloping.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
