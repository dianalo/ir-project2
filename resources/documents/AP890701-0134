The fourth-grader, flying a blue and white Cessna 210, took offfrom Moscow's Sheremetevo airport for Kuibyshev, 450 milessoutheast, the next stop on his hopscotch journey across the SovietUnion en route to Alaska.   Tony, who arrived in Moscow on Monday, spent five days touringthe capital and passed through Red Square, where West Germanteenager Mathias Rust landed a single-engine Cessna in May 1987after evading Soviet air defenses.   He had hoped to meet with Mikhail S. Gorbachev but was told byKremlin officials the president was too busy. He carried to Moscow a``friendship scroll'' with the signatures of 250,000 Americanchildren.   He has another ``friendship scroll'' he hopes 100,000 youngpeople will sign during his stops in Soviet cities and he plans topresent it to President Bush.   Tony, from San Juan Capistrano, began his global flight June 5 inCalifornia. His flight plan will take him 19,000 miles around theworld in short hops averaging three hours each.   While flying in the Soviet Union, Tony will be accompanied by aSoviet navigator because air controllers on many Soviet domesticroutes do not speak English.   The young Californian's entourage includes a second twin-engineplane for a U.S. documentary film crew, a publicity agent, a10-year-old Soviet pen pal, and Soviet and American journalists.</TEXT></DOC>
