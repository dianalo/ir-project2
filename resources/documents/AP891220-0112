Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams confirmed that some Americanswere seized at the Marriott Hotel in Panama City and taken away ashostages. ``We will make efforts to take care of that,'' he said.   The networks' request came after CBS' Jon Meyersohn and ABC'sRobert Campos were seized by rifle-carrying men said to befollowers of Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   The two producers had been in the hotel lobby, discussingsatellite transmission to New York of video of the U.S. attack, andwere about to leave when four or five heavily armed men pulled upin a truck and took them hostage, ABC spokeswoman Elise Adde said.   It isn't known where they were taken, Adde and a CBS spokesmansaid.   About 100 journalists who have been trying to cover the fightingin Panama are at the Marriott but are unable to leave because ofgun-carrying Noriega loyalists roaming the streets outside, ABCcorrespondent John Quinones reported by phone from the hotel duringa newscast today.   Meyersohn, 33, is based in New York and is a producer for the``CBS Evening News.'' Campos, 31, is based in Miami and works forvarious ABC News broadcasts. The two are U.S. citizens.   Williams declined to say whether American troops were moving onthe hotel, citing the U.S. practice of not detailing militarymovements.   Asked why U.S. troops had not taken steps earlier to protectAmericans at the Marriott, Williams said, ``There are 23,000Americans down there. There are a lot of other places there, too.''   He said he had no information on the number of Americans thathad been taken hostage from the hotel.</TEXT></DOC>
