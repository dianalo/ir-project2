Keating Jr.enriched himself at the expense of his former company as itveered toward ruin are expected to be filed here by themiddle of this week, people familiar with the case said.   These people said that a federal grand jury here is likelyto indict the former chairman of American Continental Corp.and at least two of his former associates on charges thatthey paid themselves improper bonuses, which were allegedlyskimmed from proceeds of a local land development project.</LP><TEXT>   Additionally, the people said, the expected indictment islikely to allege that Mr. Keating and the others lootedfurnishings and art from the offices of an increasinglytroubled American Continental, which filed for federalbankruptcy law protection in April 1989.   The value of the office property covered by the expectedcharges is &quot;less than $5 million,&quot; one person familiar withthe case said. The anticipated new charges would addbankruptcy fraud to the long list of federal crimes of whichMr. Keating now stands accused.   The core of the federal government's case has been broughtin Los Angeles, where Mr. Keating was indicted by a federalgrand jury last month on wide-ranging charges of bank fraudrelated to the collapse of the company's former LincolnSavings andamp; Loan Association unit. Mr. Keating has denied anywrongdoing in connection with that case.   Reached at home over the weekend, Mr. Keating's lawyer,Stephen C. Neal, said, &quot;I do understand there will be anindictment, and it's my understanding that the indictment maycharge various bankruptcy law violations.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
