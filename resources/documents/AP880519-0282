More than half of Texas banks reported lower earnings during thefirst three months, and one-third of the state's banks lost money,he said.   Among larger institutions _ ones with assets of more than $100million, two-fifths lost money, with charge-offs growing at twice1987 levels, FDIC officials reported.   Bank failures in Texas, including 25 already this year, shouldreach 70 by yearend, Seidman said. In the last five years,one-third of the banks closed were less than five years old.   Seidman also said regulators are in negotiations with potentialpurchasers of First RepublicBank Corp.   ``We are talking to people. We hope we can arrange someresolution to that situation in the near future. How soon, onlytime will tell,'' Seidman told reporters.   The FDIC is studying methods to remedy inequities in policiesthat now allow it insure all deposits in large failing banks, whilelimiting exposure to the normal $100,000 maximum at smallerinstitutions, he confirmed.   The agency in March provided such blanket coverage for depositsheld by First Republic, prompting complaints by area independentbankers.   Regulators believe there has been no mass redistribution offunds to First Republic as a result of the expanded guarantee,although, ``We have had a great number of protests about theinequities,'' Seidman said.   Seidman said ``banks in the area,'' not foreign institutions,pulled funds from First Republic, triggering the company's solvencycrisis and eventually the FDIC's $1 billion cash infusion in March.   Comparing the earlier woes at First City Bancorporation of TexasInc., which last month completed a $1.5 billion federally assistedrecapitalization. Seidman said that bank ``never had the kind ofrun that developed at First Republic.''   The FDIC did not prompt First Republic to suspend interestpayments on all debt last week, raising the specter of a bankruptcyfiling, was not prompted by the FDIC, Seidman said.   ``The (First Republic) board acted on its own judgment,'' hesaid. ``We are in daily contact with them. We have people stationedin the bank, so we are aware of what they are doing.''   Seidman also said that Albert V. Casey, 68, lured out ofretirement to run First Republic, has not been instructed to shrinkthe bank so that it might be more appealing to potential purchasers.   Seidman blamed the continuing Texas troubles on the duration ofthe state's recession and lack of an established branch-bankingsystem ``which tended to make it (Texas) much more susceptible toproblems.''   Texas's once-buoyant economy shielded bankers from theconservative lending practices of more recession-prone areas,Seidman said.</TEXT></DOC>
