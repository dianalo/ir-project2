Ten people were killed and 29 were injured Oct. 31 when a bombexploded at the headquarters of the National Federation ofSalvadoran Workers.   The attack came a day after leftist guerrillas bombarded theDefense Ministry compound with mortar shells, killing one personand wounding 15, most of them civilians.   Amnesty International said human rights sources claimed thatDefense Minister Gen. Rafael Humberto Larios made a statement thatthe labor movement would suffer the consequences of the attack onthe ministry.   The London-based rights group said the attacks in San Salvador``were not isolated incidents but took place in the context ofescalating human rights violations against members of trade unionsand grassroots organizations perceived by the government assympathetic to the guerrillas.''   Amnesty said it was appealing to President Alfredo Cristiani``to guarantee the physical security of trade unionists followingpersistent reports of violent attacks on trade union premises, andarbitrary arrests, torture and `disappearances' of trade unionistsin recent months.''   Left-wing guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National LiberationFront have been battling the government for 10 years.</TEXT></DOC>
