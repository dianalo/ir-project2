The Decision sets forth the final procedures that the DOE has formulatedto distribute crude oil overcharge funds obtained from Texaco Inc. pursuantto a Consent Order made final on August 29, 1988. The first installmentof these funds is being held in an interest-bearing escrow account pendingdistribution by the DOE and future installments will be remitted to theDOE over the next five years.The OHA has decided to distribute these funds in accordance with the DOE'sModified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges,51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (the MSRP). Under the MSRP, crude oil overchargemonies are divided among the states, the federal government, and injuredpurchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the states will bedistributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum productsduring the period of price controls. Refunds to eligible purchasers willbe based on the number of gallons of petroleum products which they purchasedand the extent to which they can demonstrate injury.Applications for refund must be filed in duplicate by October 31, 1989or 90 days after the publication of this Notice in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>whichever is later, and should be sent to theaddress set forth at the beginning of this notice.

These procedures are used to refund moniesto those injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE price and allocationregulations where the identity of such persons or the amount of their refundscannot be readily ascertained by the ERA. <T3>See Office of Enforcement</T3>, 9 DOE andpara; 82,508 (1981); <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>8 DOE andpara; 82,597 (1981).On September 28, 1988, the ERA filed a Petition for the Implementationof Special Refund Procedures to distribute funds received from Texaco Inc.(Texaco) under the terms of an August 29, 1988 consent order with Texaco.Pursuant to the terms of the consent order, Texaco is required to remita total of $1,198,000,000 to the DOE for distribution in accordance with10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V.\1\<NOTE/> On September 28, 1988, Texaco remitted to the DOE an initialpayment of $348 million which was deposited in an interest-bearing escrowaccount maintained by the U.S. Treasury. As of June 30, 1989, $20,285,608.77in interest had accrued on this amount. As stated in the consent order,Texaco has agreed to pay the balance of its obligation in accordance withthe following timetable:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In accordance with the terms of the consent order, Texacohas also remitted $52,000,000 to the United States District Court of theDistrict of Kansas in settlement of its obligations in the DOE StripperWell Exemption Litigation, M.D.L. 378.(a) $190 million plus accrued interest within 18 months of the effectivedate of the consent order.(b) 4 annual payments of $165 million plus accrued interest.On March 24, 1989, the OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) tentativelyestablishing Subpart V procedures for the distribution of the Texaco consentorder fund. <T3>Texaco Inc., </T3>54 FR 13420 (April 3, 1989). This Decision and Orderfinalizes the procedures to be used for distributing that portion of theTexaco consent order funds which is attributable to alleged crude oil violations.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>On July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Modified Statement of RestitutionaryPolicy concerning crude oil overcharges. 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (``theMSRP''). The MSRP, which was issued as a result of a court-approved FinalSettlement Agreement in <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>M.D.L. 378 (D. Kan.), provides that crude oil overcharge monies willbe divided among the states, federal government, and injured purchasersof refined petroleum products. Under the MSRP, up to 20 percent of thesecrude oil overcharge monies may be reserved initially to satisfy validclaims by injured purchasers of crude oil and refined petroleum products.Eighty percent of the funds, and any monies remaining after all valid claimsare paid, are to be disbursed equally to the states and federal governmentfor indirect restitution.The OHA has decided to apply the MSRP in all Subpart V proceedings involvingalleged crude oil violations. <T3>See </T3>Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986).That Order provided a period of 30 days for the filing of any objectionsto the application of the MSRP, and solicited comments concerning the appropriateprocedures to follow in processing refund applications in crude oil refundproceedings.On April 6, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous commentswhich it received in response to the August 1986 Order. 52 FR 11737 (April10, 1987). The Notice set forth generalized procedures and provided guidanceto assist claimants that wish to file refund applications for crude oilmonies under the Subpart V regulations. All applicants for refunds wouldbe required to document their purchase volumes of petroleum products duringthe period of price controls and prove that they were injured by the allegedcrude oil overcharges. The Notice indicated that end-users of petroleumproducts whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry willnot be presumed to have absorbed the crude oil overcharges, and need notsubmit any further proof of injury to receive a refund. Finally, we statedthat refunds would be calculated on the basis of a per-gallon refund amountderived by dividing crude oil violation amounts by the total consumptionof petroleum products in the United States during the period of price controls.The numerator would include the crude oil overcharge monies that were inthe DOE's escrow account at the time of the settlement and a portion ofthe funds in the MDL 378 escrow at the time of the settlement.The DOE has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April1987 Notice, <T3>see, e.g., Shell Oil Co., </T3>17 DOE andpara; 85,204 (1988), and <T3>Ernest A. Allerkamp,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,079 (1988), and these procedureshave been approved by the United States District Court for the Districtof Kansas. Various States had filed a motion with that Court, claimingthat the OHA had violated the Settlement Agreement by employing presumptionsof injury and by improperly calculating the refund amount to be used inthis proceeding. On August 17, 1987, the Court issued an Opinion and Orderdenying the States' motion in its entirety. The court concluded that theSettlement Agreement ``does not bar OHA from permitting claimants to employreasonable presumptions in affirmatively demonstrating injury entitlingthem to a refund.'' <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>671 F. Supp. 1318, 1323 (D. Kan. 1987). The court also ruled that,as specified in the April 1987 Notice, the OHA could calculate refundsby including a portion of the M.D.L. 378 overcharges. The latter rulingwas affirmed by the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>857 F. 2d 1481 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Proposed Decision and Order</ITAG>As stated above, on March 24, 1989, the OHA issued a Proposed Decisionand Order tentatively establishing procedures for the distribution of the$1,198,000,000 Texaco consent order fund, plus interest. In the PDO, weproposed to divide the consent order fund into two pools: a refined productpool consisting of $120,000,000 plus accrued interest, and a crude oilpool of $1,078,000,000 plus accrued interest. We believed this was themost reasonable way to divide the funds and it was consistent with thedivision suggested by ERA in its Notices announcing the signing and finalizationof the Texaco consent order. <T3>See</T3> 53 FR 15106 (April 27, 1988); 53 FR 32929 (August 29, 1988).The refined product pool would be made available to purchasers of Texacorefined products who demonstrate that they were injured as a result ofTexaco's alleged regulatory violations in the sale of these products. Additionally,we proposed that the total refined product amount be taken out of Texaco'sinitial payment of $348 million. We further proposed that the crude oilpool would be distributed in accordance with the MSRP and the April 1987Notice. We proposed that the crude oil fund would be comprised of $228million from Texaco's initial payment and all future payments receivedfrom Texaco. In this Decision and Order, we will establish procedures fordistributing the Texaco crude oil pool only. Procedures for the distributionof the refined product pool will be issued at a future date.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In addition, this Decision does not consider proposedrequirements for refund applications submitted by filing services and otherrepresentatives. <T3>See</T3> PDO Part IV. Those proposals, if adopted, will apply onlyto applications submitted in the Texaco refined product proceeding.Pursuant to the MSRP, the OHA proposed in the PDO to reserve initially20 percent of the crude oil pool for direct restitution to applicants whoclaim that they were injured by the alleged crude oil violations. The remaining80 percent of the funds would be distributed to the state and federal governmentsfor indirect restitution. After all valid claims are paid, any remainingfunds in the individual crude oil claims reserve also would be dividedequally between the states and federal governments. The federal government'sshare ultimately would be deposited in the general fund of the Treasuryof the United States.In the PDO, the OHA proposed to require applicants for refunds from thecrude oil pool to document their purchase volumes of petroleum productsduring the period of price controls and to prove that they were injuredby the alleged crude oil overcharges. We stated that end-users of petroleumproducts whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry coulduse a presumption that they absorbed the crude oil overcharges, and neednot submit further proof of injury to receive a refund. The OHA also proposedto calculate refunds on the basis of a per gallon volumetric refund amountderived by dividing the amount of funds in the crude oil pool by the totalconsumption of petroleum products in the United States during the periodof price controls.\3\<NOTE/> Finally, we proposed to combine the Texaco crude oil volumetricrefund amount with all of the volumetric refund amounts obtained in eachcrude oil refund proceeding implemented to date under the MSRP. Commentswere solicited regarding the tentative distribution process set forth inthe Proposed Decision.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ As a number of commenters on the proposed procedures pointedout, in calculating the proposed Texaco crude oil volumetric refund amount,we erroneously used in the numerator only the 20 percent of the crude oilpool reserved for individual claimants. This error has been corrected inthis Decision and Order. <T3>See</T3> Part IV.A., <T3>infra</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Comments Received</ITAG>In response to the Proposed Decision, the OHA received written submissionsfrom state governments, a number of law firms, and several other representativesof potential claimants in this proceeding. In addition, on June 27, 1989,we held a public hearing at which oral testimony was presented regardingthe proposed procedures. Only those comments which concern the disbursementof the crude oil pool will be considered in this Decision.Several firms commented regarding the proper amounts of monies to be reservedfor the crude oil and refined product pools. Two of the commenters, EnergyRefunds Inc. (ERI) and the National Association of Texaco Wholesalers (NATW)contend that the refined product pool should be increased and the crudeoil pool decreased. The NATW, an organization that represents present andformer Texaco consignees and wholesalers, bases its position on the factthat the States have already been granted ``extremely substantial refunds''as a result of the Stripper Well Settlement. Furthermore, the NATW contendsthat our proposed division of monies ignores numerous complaints filedwith the DOE by petroleum product resellers that alleged that Texaco violatedthe Mandatory Price and Allocation Regulations pertaining to refined products.These alleged violations, the NATW claims, resulted in Texaco product resellersincurring a greater injury than refund applicants in previous Subpart Vproceedings. According to the NATW, the present division of funds wouldbe insufficient to compensate purchasers of Texaco refined products forthat injury. Finally, the NATW argues that increasing the size of the refinedproduct pool would not lessen the amount of money available to the statesand federal government for indirect restitution since they would receiveany excess funds after all direct claims have been paid. ERI contends thatsince the ERA, in its Notice announcing the signing of the Texaco consentorder, determined that the maximum liability for alleged refined productviolations was approximately 16 percent of its total maximum liability,the refined product pool should be increased from the proposed amount of$120,000,000 to $200,091,996, which is approximately 16 percent of thetotal consent order fund.In contrast, one commentor, attorney Philip Kalodner (Kalodner), contendsthat the proposed crude oil pool is not large enough and the refined productspool is too large. Kalodner, who represents various end-users in the crudeoil refund proceeding, asserts that a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) issuedto Texaco on May 12, 1987 (Case No. NTXROOA1), alleged violations responsiblefor 80 to 90 percent or more of Texaco's refined product overcharge liability.That PRO was never finalized. In contrast, he maintains the vast majorityof the alleged crude oil overcharges by Texaco were the subject of a finalRemedial Order. <T3>See Texaco Inc.,</T3> 14 DOE andpara; 83,037 (1986).\4\<NOTE/> Kalodner concludes that the refined product pool should bereduced to $60 million and crude oil pool increased to $1,138,000,000.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Kalodner argues that it is likely that the DOE would haveprevailed in Texaco's appeal of the Remedial Order since its basic positionwas accepted by the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals in <T3>DOE v. Louisiana,</T3> 90 F. 2d 180 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1982).We do not agree with the contentions raised in support of either increasingor decreasing the monies in the crude oil and refined product pools. Eachone is flawed by self-serving arguments. Initially, it is important toreiterate our position stated in the PDO that the Texaco consent orderis a negotiated compromise of all alleged violations, both known and unknown,and not a dollar for dollar settlement of the outstanding DOE enforcementproceedings involving Texaco. In the process of negotiating the consentorder, the ERA evaluated the allegations raised against Texaco, and enteredinto a settlement that it believed fairly concluded all administrativeand legal proceedings, as well as accounted for unknown allegations, litigationrisks and interest payments since the date of alleged violation. <T3>See PDO,</T3> 54 FR at 13421 n.4; Notice of Final Consent Order withTexaco Inc., 53 FR 32929, 32931 (August 29, 1988). Accordingly, it is notproper for the commentors to attempt to rely on individual remedial orders,either proposed or final, as the sole basis for the composition of thecrude oil and refined product pools. None of these proceedings had finalityin any sense. Moreover, the Texaco settlement includes potential violationsthat have not yet ripened into enforcement documents and may not have beenpreviously considered. None of the commentors considers the impact of theseunspecified violations, and therefore, their estimates of the proper sizeof the crude oil and refined product pools are inadequate.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Additionally, Kalodner's claim that a single PRO issuedon May 12, 1987 represents the large majority of alleged refined productviolations ignores the issuance of at least five Remedial Orders that involvedallegations of substantial violations of the price regulations in Texaco'ssales of refined products. <T3>See Texaco Inc.,</T3> 14 DOE andpara; 83,016 (1986) (Case No. HRO-0012)($142,783,783 in overcharges alleged for violations in pricing and costrecoveries relating to motor gasoline and No. 2 fuel oil); 14 DOE andpara;83,034 (1986) (Case No. HRO-0272) ($810,813.56 in overcharges for violationsin pricing of motor gasoline and distillates); 14 DOE andpara; 83,047 (1986)(Case No. HRO-0273) ($1,499,761.41 in overcharges for violations in pricingof motor gasoline and distillates); 15 DOE andpara; 83,003 (1986) (Case No.HRO-0032) ($163,079.47 in overcharges for misapplication of the equal applicationrule in sales of NGLPs); 15 DOE andpara; 83,027 (1987) (Case No. HRO-0275)($1,148,378.55 in overcharges for violations in the pricing of propaneand $275,821.81 in cost overrecoveries); 16 DOE andpara; 83,016 (1987) (CaseNo. HRO-0276) ($101,324.97 in overcharges for violations in sales of propane).Furthermore, we reject the NATW's contention that the crude oil pool shouldbe decreased since the States (and the federal government) have alreadybeen compensated under the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement. The receiptof a portion of the Texaco crude oil monies by the state and federal governmentsis in no way intended to compensate these entities for their purchasesof refined petroleum products on which overcharges occurred. Instead, thesefunds are intended to provide <T3>indirect</T3> restitution through state energy programs and depositsinto the federal Treasury. Distribution of crude oil monies in this wayhas been recognized as an equitable and efficient way to provide restitutionto the unidentified (and unidentifiable) purchasers of refined petroleumproducts. <T3>See In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation</T3>653 F.Supp. 108 (D. Kan. 1986) (approving Settlement Agreement); <T3>MSRP,</T3> 51 FR. 27901. The fact that the states and the federal governmentshave served as a conduit for indirect restitution in no way precludes themfrom also serving as an effective channel for restitution for the Texacocrude oil funds. \6\<NOTE/> Accordingly, we are not persuaded to increase or decreasethe size of the crude oil pool. The proposed division suggested by ERAis in our opinion the most equitable split of the Texaco consent orderfund and is made in recognition of both the known and unknown alleged violationscommitted by Texaco.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Additionally, the NATW is incorrect in its claim thatan increase in the size of the refined product pool would have no adverseeffect other than to delay the states' receipt of these funds. If the NATW'srequest were granted the refined product volumetric refund amount wouldbe increased. This would result in a larger per gallon refund amount foreach successful product applicant and a corresponding reduction in theamount of money available for direct and indirect restitution for crudeoil overcharges.Another issue raised by commenters involves the 20 percent reserve amountwe proposed for individual crude oil claims. Kalodner argues that the reserveshould be increased in order to guarantee the principle of ``full parity''for all refund claimants. \7\<NOTE/> Based upon his calculations, the 20 percent reserve amountfrom this and other crude oil refund proceedings will not be sufficientto guarantee full parity for crude oil refund applicants.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The full parity approach of calculating the crude oilvolumetric includes in the numerator of the volumetric the $1.4 billionin the M.D.L. 378 escrow account at the time of settlement minus the $415million awarded to refiners, retailers and resellers plus the crude oilovercharge payments that were in the DOE's escrow account at the time ofthe Settlement Agreement and subsequent crude oil settlement amounts. Thisapproach was adopted to compensate refund recipients in the M.D.L. 378and Subpart V proceedings on an equal basis. This approach most fairlyand equitably effectuates restitution for the injury they suffered as aresult of crude oil overcharges and is also the most administratively efficientsince it tends to eliminate repetitive reapplications and obviates theneed to consider pesky issues of upstream overcharge absorption. <T3>See</T3> April 1987 Notice, 52 FR 11741.We have repeatedly considered similar claims by Kalodner and have not foundthem convincing. <T3>See, e.g., Shell Oil Co.</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,204 (1988); <T3>Hood Goldsberry,</T3> 18 DOE andpara; 85,902 at 89,476 (1989). The SettlementAgreement specifically requires that no more than 20 percent of the totalescrowed funds be reserved to pay direct claims and permits only downwardadjustment of the reserve from the initial 20 percent figure. SettlementAgreement andpara; IV.B.6 The 20 percent reserve amount provides sufficientfunds for direct restitution, and Kalodner's concern that additional fundswill be needed to pay valid claims is unwarranted. \8\<NOTE/> Consequently, we will not reserve more than 20 percent ofthe Texaco crude oil pool for payments of claims, but, instead, will adoptour proposal to reserve the full 20 percent.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ For this reason, we will not follow Kalodner's suggestionthat we petition the M.D.L. 378 Court for permission to increase the reserve.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The States, which in prior proceedings have requestedthat we reduce the reserve amount, in the present case simply request thatwe reduce the 20 percent reserve amount if we determine that less thanthat amount is necessary to pay direct claimants. It continues to be ourposition that we will reduce the reserve amount if we determine that thefull 20 percent is not needed to pay direct claimants.One commenter, Michael O'N. Barron (Barron), requests that claimants whopurchased crude oil directly from Texaco during the period of controlsbe allowed to receive a per gallon refund greater than the volumetric amountafforded to applicants whose claims are based on purchases of refined petroleumproducts. The OHA's procedures for granting refunds based upon direct purchasesof crude oil are explained in <T3>New York Petroleum Inc./Ashland Oil Inc.,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,613(1987) (<T3>New York Petroleum/Ashland</T3>), and <T3>Concoco Inc./Delmarva Power,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,622 (1988) (<T3>Conoco/Delmarva</T3>). As those cases indicate, crude oil overchargestend to be different in type and magnitude from refined product overcharges,and imputation of a volumetric amount is not necessarily appropriate. Calculationof a refund amount for direct purchasers of crude oil is instead determinedby the circumstances of the particular case. \10\<NOTE/> We will therefore not calculate a separate volumetric refundfactor for direct purchasers of crude oil.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ In <T3>New York Petroleum/Ashland,</T3> the claimant relied upon the findingof a Remedial Order which stated an overcharge amount for the purchasesmade by the claimant. In <T3>Conoco/Delmarva,</T3> the claimant was an end-user of crude oil thatwas not a party to any remedial action taken against the firm. In orderto determine an appropriate refund, we calculated a volumetric based onthe total dollar amount of the crude oil pool divided by the total gallonsof crude oil sold by the consent order firm. In both cases, the applicantwas responsible for demonstrating that it was injured by its purchasesfrom the consent order firm.Finally, ERI contends that resellers and retailers who filed late claimsfor refunds from the Stripper Well escrow accounts in Kansas should beable to receive crude oil refunds from oil overcharge funds held by theDOE without providing a detailed demonstration of injury as proposed inthe PDO. To support its contention, ERI notes that resellers and retailersdid not have to prove injury in order to receive refunds from the StripperWell escrows. The firm also refers to the words of United States DistrictCourt Judge Frank Theis, who stated that ``any claimant who has filed alate claim is not without a remedy. Resellers who forego filing claimsunder the Resellers Order may be eligible for refunds by the Departmentof Energy's Office of Hearings and Appeals.'' <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3><T3>slip op.</T3> at 2 (D. Kan April 7, 1987). According to ERI, becauseJudge Theis did not state that reseller claimants needed to demonstrateinjury, the OHA should not require an injury showing in a proceeding referredto by Judge Theis as the proper forum for resellers to seek a refund. Furthermore,ERI contends that a detailed demonstration of injury is ``unreasonableand unattainable'' for resellers, and that the OHA has already been presentedwith sufficient evidence in the Stripper Well proceeding to conclude thatresellers were inured by crude oil overcharges. ERI's March 31, 1989 commentsat 2.We are not persuaded by ERI's comments. ERI misreads Judge Theis' comments.While he noted untimeliness in applying to the Resellers Escrow was notfatal, he simply offered another avenue. He did not predict success orprescribe that the more beneficial standards for disbursements from theResellers Escrow be applied. Nor did he prescribe that the same standardsthat applied to end-user applicants in the Subpart V proceeding be appliedto resellers who applied in that proceeding. In fact, the Stripper WellSettlement Agreement, which was specifically approved by Judge Theis, requiresthat crude oil monies in the DOE escrows be distributed in accordance withtraditional Subpart V procedures, and that ``each claimant must affirmativelydemonstrate that it had been injured by the alleged [crude oil] violation[s]. . .'' <T3>See Stripper Well Settlement Agreement</T3> andpara; VI.B.1.; <T3>see also</T3> 10 CFR andSection;205.280 (refunds to be made to ``injuredpersons''). In the case of resellers, we have stated on numerous occasionsthat a showing of injury requires a demonstration that the alleged overchargeswere absorbed and not passed through to their customers. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> April 10 Notice 52 FR at 11742; <T3>Robert H. Bennett,</T3> 18 DOE andpara;85,270 (1988).\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\As indicated in Part IV.A <T3>infra,</T3> resellers may attempt to prove injury through the use ofeconometric evidence of the type that was submitted in the Stripper Wellevidentiary hearing. ERI has not, however, stated that it intends to makesuch a showing for resellers in its comments on the PDO.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. The Refund Procedures</ITAG>A. Refund ClaimsAfter considering the comments received, we have concluded that $1,078,000,000of the consent order amounts covered by this Decision, including $228 millionof the Texaco funds currently available, plus interest, should be distributedin accordance with the crude oil refund procedures proposed in the PDO.\12\<NOTE/> As indicated in Part III <T3>supra,</T3> we have decided to reserve initially the full 20 percentof the $228 million crude oil violation portion of Texaco's initial paymentto the DOE, or $45,600,000, plus interest,\13\<NOTE/> for direct refunds to claimants. The amount of the reservemay be adjusted downward later if circumstances warrant.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\As of June 30, 1989, $13,291,130.87 in interest had accruedon the $228 million. Therefore, the portion of the crude oil pool thatwill be disbursed pursuant to this Decision and Order totals $241,291,130.87.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\As of June 30, 1989, $2,658,226.17 in interest had accruedon this amount.The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on allegedcrude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has usedin Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based on alleged refined productovercharges, <T3>MAPCO, Inc.,</T3> 15 DOE andpara;85,097 (1986); <T3>Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,</T3> 14 DOE andpara;85,475 (1986) (<T4>Mountain Fuel</T4>). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will berequired to document their purchase volumes and demonstrate that they wereinjured. Following Subpart V precedent, reasonable estimates of purchasevolumes may be submitted. <T3>Greater Richmond Transit Co.,</T3> 15 DOE andpara;85,028 (1986). Generally,it is not necessary for applicants to identify their suppliers of petroleumproducts in order to receive a refund. End-users of ultimate consumersof petroleum products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industryand who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are presumed to haveabsorbed rather than passed on alleged crude oil overchargers.

Payments to the States and Federal Government</ITAG>Under the terms of the MSRP, the remaining 80 percent of the $228 millionplus interrest in alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this Decision,or $182,400,000 million plus interest, should be disbursed equally to thestates and federal government for indirect restitution. As of June 30,1989, the accrued interest on these funds was $10,632,904.70. The totalamount to be disbursed to the states and federal government pursuant tothis determination is therefore $193,032,904.70.Accordingly, we will direct the DOE's Office of the Controller to segregatethe $193,032,904.70 available for disbursement to the states and federalgovernment and transfer one-half of that amount, or $96,516,452.35, intoan interest-bearing subaccount for the states, and one-half, or $96,516,452.35,to an interest-bearing subaccount for the federal government. In the nearfuture, we will issue a Decision and Order directing the DOE's Office ofthe Controller to make the appropriate disbursements to the individualstates from their respective subaccount. Issuance of these orders is necessaryto improve our ability to track the various disbursements to the states.Each individual state's percentage share of funds is set forth in ExhibitH to the Settlement Agreement and is based on each state's consumptionof petroleum products during the period of price controls. When disbursed,these funds will be subject to the same use limitations and reporting requirementsas all other crude oil monies received by the states under the SettlementAgreement.It is therefore ordered that:(1) Applications for Refund from the alleged crude oil overcharge fundsremitted to the Department of Energy by Texaco Inc. pursuant to the ConsentOrder finalized on August 29, 1988 may now be filed.(2) All applications submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) above must befiled no later than October 31, 1989 or 90 days from the publication ofthis Decision and Order in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>whichever is later.(3) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll, Office of DepartmentalAccounting and Financial Systems Development, Office of the Controller,Department of Energy, shall take all steps necessary to transfer $241,291,130.87from the Texaco Inc. subaccount, Consent Order Number PTXE006A1Z, pursuantto Paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of this Decision.(4) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $96,516,452.35of the funds obtained pursuant to paragraph (3) above, plus interest whichaccrues from June 30, 1989 to the date of transfer, into the subaccountdenominated ``Crude Tracking-States,'' Number 999DOE003W.(5) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $96,516,452.35of the funds obtained pursuant to paragraph (3) above, plus interest whichaccrues from June 30, 1989 to the date of transfer, into the subaccountdenominated ``Crude Tracking-Federal,'' Number 999DOE002W.(6) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $48,258,226.17of the funds obtained pursuant to paragraph (3) above, plus interest whichaccrues from June 30, 1989 to the date of transfer, into the subaccountdenominated ``Crude Tracking-Claimants 2,'' Number 999DOE008Z.<ITAG tagnum="6">George B.
