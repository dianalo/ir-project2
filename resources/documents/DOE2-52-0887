Termination of the SGF at the presently activeSACF is abrupt and prompts the question Has the San Gabriel Fault beenoffset? Tectonic and geometric relationships in the area suggest thatthe SGF has been offset approximately 6 mi in a left-lateral sense andthat the offset continuation of the SGF, across the SACF, is the right-lateral,strike-slip San Jacinto fault (SJF), which also terminates at the SACF.Reversing the left-lateral movement on the SACF to rejoin the offsetends of the SGF and SJF reveals a fault trace that is remarkably similarin geometry and movement (and perhaps in tectonic history), to the traceof the San Andreas fault through the southern part of the San BernardinoMountains. The relationship of the Sierra Madre-Cucamonga fault systemto the restored SGF-SJF fault is strikingly similar to the relationshipof the Banning fault to the Mission Creek-Mill Creek portion of the SanAndreas fault. Structural relations suggest that the San Gabriel-SanJacinto system predates the San Andreas fault in the eastern San GabrielMountains and that continuing movement on the SACF is currently affectingthe trace of the San Andreas fault in the Cajon Pass area.</TEXT></DOC>
