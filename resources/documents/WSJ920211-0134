A spokesman for the 52% state-owned German flag carrierstressed, however, that nothing concrete has developed fromlate-January contacts between Lufthansa Chairman JuergenWeber and representatives of U.S. carriers, which it wouldn'tidentify.</LP><TEXT>   He also said that while Weber and Lufthansa might beinterested in discussing the possibility of a jointly runairline company with Aeroflot, there have been no talks aboutsuch a project to date. &quot;There have been no agreements, ornegotiating delegations,&quot; the spokesman said, though he addedthat the two companies, which have ongoing business links incertain areas, have continuous contacts as most airlines do.   Meantime, Lufthansa confirmed a report in the Germanweekly news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; yesterday that the companyhad a loss of 230 million marks ($147 million) on itsLufthansa airline operations in December alone.   Without providing more details, the Lufthansa spokesmansaid that the December 1991 loss was larger than that of ayear earlier. But he emphasized that most airlines encounteroperating losses in December, which is an off-peak businessmonth. &quot;It is completely normal to be dragged by losses inDecember,&quot; he said.   Last week, Lufthansa announced it expects to post a groupnet loss of around 400 million marks for 1991, much worsethan expected. Lufthansa cited the negative impact of theGulf War on its operations, among other factors, for thedeficit last year.   Separately, the Lufthansa spokesman said the airline hasdecided to postpone orders for 11 short-range jet aircraftoriginally planned for delivery in 1993. He couldn't say whendelivery eventually will be taken.   Those orders were for a combination of 737-type aircraftproduced by Boeing Co. of the U.S. and A320-type planes madeby Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturingconsortium.</TEXT></DOC>
