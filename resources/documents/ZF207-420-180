visions are falling bythe wayside.andM;To preserve budget and personnel, management needs a creative, new automationapproach which will command the attention (and available resources) of theuser community and top management.andM;AUTOMATION KNOWLEDGE BASEandM;Automation is nothing more than an abstract model of the process of doingbusiness.andP;  For too long, we in the information systems community haveoverlooked the strategic business value of this model.andM;Preferring to exercise this knowledge in pursuit of bits, bytes andbandwidth, we have somewhat ignored the goals of the business, and in theprocess the only systematically organized and easy to access base ofstrategic knowledge.andM;Yet this knowledge base is the exact place to look when trying to makeobjective decisions about how to make the business run effectively withleaner budgets.andP;  By extracting the knowledge and comparing models within thebusiness, a review team can spot areas of overlap that might be restructuredto save time and money.andM;Review can be conducted by business analysts or management consultants with acouple of top information systems people.andM;To take advantage of this knowledge resource, it is necessary to change theautomation model into a highly visible and consistent form that can bequickly absorbed by the review team and top management.andM;Because programmers are not known for their command of the English language,their program documentation can be awfully confusing to laymen.andP;  Fortunately,the advent of powerful computer-aided software engineering (Case)technologies has provided the modeling tools and techniques for the task.andM;Case tools make it possible to view business in an objective, highlygraphical format, justifying their use in a clear model of the informationsystem and related business process.andP;  Of course, this brings along additionalrewards.andP;  It is easier to maintain and evolve the system.andM;The data and process models supported by Case tools help the reviewersrapidly identify patterns within the organization and find overlap.andP;  Becauseit is common to find a lot of different names for the same thing in largebusinesses, separate data and process models also help the team organize andsift through that confusion.andM;While it is important to have these two distinct models, it is even morecrucial to have some third method for interconnecting them.andP;  The purpose ofan organizational element and its importance to the business becomes clearonly at the interface between structure and behavior.andM;During several years of re-engineering activities, I found that the notion of&quot;event&quot; modeling put forward by the database community seems to fulfill myneeds in this area.andP;  An event is something important that happens to thebusiness.andP;  As such, it identifies why business structures are put into actionand behave as they do.andM;This is vital information for re-engineering, re-organization, and costre-allocation.andP;  Since few methodologies or tools provide a good way to bridgethis gap, one either has to find a suitable method and force fit it intoone's current Case tool, or buy a new Case tool that already encompasses sucha method.andM;Fortunately, the Case community is adding object-oriented design extensionswhich may be used to facilitate event modeling.andM;Thus, by combining Case, traditional data and process modeling techniques, anobjective, real-world model of the business can be quickly constructed,largely from the existing base of knowledge.andM;This clear model is also useful for maintaining existing information systems,designing corporate databases and data dictionaries, crafting expert systemsfor management decision-making, and planning for new technology.andM;As database and networking have helped make information a corporate resource,re-engineering techniques and Case tools now promise to deliver businessknowledge to the whole enterprise.andM;By channeling this available, yet sorely under-utilized resource into theheart of business planning and cost re-allocation activities, management willboth master the budget crunch and reap the attendant rewards.andP;  Automationmanagement now has an opportunity to help guide the entire business.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
