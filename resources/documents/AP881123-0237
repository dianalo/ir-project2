ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Before launching the space shuttle Discovery inSeptember, NASA issued a 72-page press kit to describe the missionand its astronauts in meticulous detail. For the next launch, Dec.1, there is no press kit at all.   The difference is that Flight 27 is a military mission flown bymilitary men to launch a secret military payload. All that NASA andthe Air Force will say is that the launch will be between 6:32 and9:32 a.m. EST and that there will be five crew members.   Because the Air Force is in charge of STS-27, there is none ofthe hoopla that accompanies other shuttle flights. No daily morningbriefings on the readiness of the ship, no launch-day-minus-oneseries of briefings on crew, mission and payload. No industryrepresentatives handing out fact sheets and literature.   The Air Force undoubtedly would prefer that no one even see thelaunch, but it is difficult to hide the liftoff of something 184feet tall, trailing fire for 700 feet. So, instead, the Air Forcetries to give as few advance details as possible.   The flight of Atlantis will be only the third time that a shuttlemission is strictly for military pursuits.   Although the cargo is secret, word leaks out. Atlantis, accordingto reports, is carrying an intelligence-gathering satellite that,once in its orbit, will fly over 80 percent of the Soviet Union. Thetwo earlier military missions, both in 1985, put satellites intoorbit, one to eavesdrop and two for communications.   The Space Act of 1958, which created NASA, specified that theagency was to develop peaceful uses of space in an open program. Butthe military always has had and will continue to have a strong rolein both NASA and space.   In fact, before the 1986 Challenger accident halted shuttleflights for 32 months, NASA was so worried it would lose Air Forcebusiness that it got the White House to help work out an agreementthat the military would use one-third of shuttle cargo space.   NASA also fought Air Force efforts to re-establish expendablerockets as means to get satellites into orbits, hoping to keep theshuttle the sole launch vehicle. In light of the Challenger accidentlater, it was fortunate that the space agency lost that fight andsome Titan rockets already were on the production line.   In its early day, the space agency had no rockets, so itpurchased ballistic missiles from the military and fitted them withupper stages. The Army's Redstone and the Air Force's Atlas boostedthe first Americans into space.   The early NASA astronauts were military test pilots, and untilthe shuttle came along, the Navy was called in to retrieveastronauts and their ships from the water. NASA returned the favorby making its breakthroughs in materials, electronics and computertechnology available to the military.   As the shuttle was being developed, the Air Force realized itcould become a valuable military tool and it imposed some designchanges, among them the size of the cargo bay and an increase in itsability to land cross-range.   Along the way, however, some disenchantment developed.   NASA's openness was anathema to a service that likes secrets. Sowhen the Air Force built a shuttle launch pad at Vandenberg AFB inCalifornia, it tucked it in among hills. The Air Force also tried,with some success, to limit access to the press site at CapeCanaveral, citing safety concerns.   At the time of the Challenger accident, the reserve of expendablelaunch vehicles had dwindled to a dozen and in congressionaltestimony NASA was arguing strongly for retaining the shuttle as thesole launch vehicle.   The Air Force, especially then-Deputy Air Force Secretary EdwardC. Aldridge, had been fighting for two years to maintain analternate launch route.   The Challenger tragedy, with its loss of seven lives, turned NASAaround and its plans now are enthusiastically in favor of a mixedfleet in which shuttles will launch what only shuttles can launchand leave the rest to expendable launch vehicles. The irony is, NASAmust buy its single-use rockets from the Air Force.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon Pms, Nov. 28</NOTE></DOC>
