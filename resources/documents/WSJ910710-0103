But some defense industry officials cautioned that the$682 million transaction isn't necessarily a bellwether ofhow easily future Middle East arms packages will go through.</LP><TEXT>   Military contractors have been looking at the UAE sale togauge how Capitol Hill will react to proposed U.S. weaponstransfers in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War. Butwithout another sale to the region lined up behind it --especially to Saudi Arabia -- the UAE deal &quot;has becomedefanged,&quot; said Joel Johnson, vice president of internationalactivities at the Aerospace Industries Association, aWashington trade group.   Just yesterday, the U.S., Soviet Union, Britain, Franceand China reached an accord in Paris to limit weapons of massdestruction and otherwise restrain arms shipments to theMideast. But Mr. Johnson noted that the latter four nationsall have apparently sold weapons to the area since the end ofthe war, making a U.S. shipment to the UAE not terriblyonerous in the eyes of the international community.   Moreover, where it once looked like the Saudis would buybillions of dollars of U.S. arms after the war, such a saleisn't likely to materialize quickly, maybe not even beforenext year. Thus, supporters of Israel and others wary ofproliferation of arms through the Middle East have decidednot to expend much political capital on trying to stop theUAE sale now.   In government-to-government arms sales, such as this one,the administration gives lawmakers formal notice of itsintent to send weapons to a particular country. UnlessCongress votes to oppose the transaction, it commences after30 days. In this case, the 30-day deadline is scheduled toexpire tomorrow.   The only serious legislative obstacles raised against theUAE sale were resolutions of disapproval sponsored by DanteFascell (D., Fla.) in the House and Alan Cranston (D.,Calif.) in the Senate. Although both measures collected someprominent signatures, Mr. Fascell and his allies acknowledgethat they have run out of time to get the necessary votes fortheir resolution.   That is particularly good news for McDonnell DouglasCorp., which manufactures the Apache, and RockwellInternational Corp., maker of the Hellfire.   The U.S. Army is scheduled to procure the helicopter,which saw considerable action during Operation Desert Storm,only through this year. The service has plans eventually tobuy an upgraded version known as the Longbow, but McDonnellDouglas is hoping that foreign sales can keep the originalline going until that follow-on program is funded.   The UAE package alone will give the Apache program anotherfour or five months of life, helping to keep its supplier andemployment bases intact. Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia havealso ordered Apaches.</TEXT></DOC>
