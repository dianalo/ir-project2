REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Corruption charges are tarnishing theimage of President Corazon Aquino's government, even though no onehas produced evidence she is sanctioning practices that led to thedownfall of her predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos.   For months, Manila newspapers have been replete with allegationsof official corruption. They include ``disappearing'' food stocks,rake-offs from state-run companies, bribery in the Customs Bureauand shakedowns by crooked policemen.   Last week, retired Maj. Gen. Cesar Tapia, who was appointedsecurity chief at Manila airport to clean up corruption there, quitin disgust, saying he was powerless to root out ``institutionalizedgraft.''   Mrs. Aquino's personal integrity remains unquestioned. Butcritics allege some of her relatives used their connections toenhance their wealth in questionable business deals.   In August, Ramon Diaz quit as chairman of the PresidentialCommission on Good Government, citing interference by relatives of``powers that be'' in efforts to retrieve the billions of dollarsMarcos and his associates allegedly embezzled during his 20-yearadministration.   Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986 after he was ousted incivilian-military uprising that placed Mrs. Aquino in power.   Few of the recent allegations against Mrs. Aquino have beenproven, and so far no senior official has gone to jail. Many of thecharges have been leveled by self-serving opposition politiciansseeking to find an issue with which to embarrass the president.   Last week, opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile admitted he waswrong in claiming Mrs. Aquino's brother-in-law, Paul Aquino, hadsecretly assumed the chairmanship of Security Bank, which was takenover by the government because of its links to Marcos.   Nonetheless, political commentators believe the sheer volume ofthe charges has sullied the reputation of an administration whichcame to power promising to clean up government after rampantcorruption under Marcos.   At best, the charges point to widespread inefficiency,incompetence and mismanagement in the bureaucracy. In some cases,government investigators acknowledged widespread irregularities instate agencies but found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.   Mrs. Aquino has vowed to stamp out corruption but demands proofbefore she will crack down on alleged offenders. She has saidfrequently that most of the allegations have been raised by herenemies to undermine her personally.   But some analysts believe strong measures are necessary becauseof public sensitivity after years of blatant, state-sanctionedcorruption under Marcos.   ``The president must start giving her people some big fish tofry,'' said the pro-government Philippine Daily Inquirer.``Otherwise, they will set their hooks elsewhere. And the bloodwill spatter not just the walls of bureaucray but on thefoundations of our new democracy as well.''   Some analysts believe Filipinos are quick to accept corruptionallegations _ regardless of proof _ because many see examples ofpetty graft every day.   These include policemen who shake down motorists for bribes toignore traffic violations to bureaucrats who accept ``tips'' tospeed processing of licenses and other official documents.   Vast timberlands are being systematically denuded of trees byillegal logging operations. It is widely assumed such operationscontinue under the protection of corrupt military officers.   Impatience with high-level corruption has also been heightenedbecause millions of Filipinos must struggle daily simply to earnenough to feed, clothe and shelter themselves and their families.   Coupled with that is the continuing failure of the government toimprove the economic livelihood of millions, especially those wholive in the impoverished countryside.   ``There is a strong perception here that Mrs. Aquino ispersonally honest,'' said Most Rev. Leonardo Legaspi, archbishop ofNaga City, located about 190 miles southeast of Manila. ``Butpeople do not see goodness translated into something that iseffective.''</TEXT></DOC>
