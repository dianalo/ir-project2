The vote probably dooms this trade measure, with its contentious provision requiring advance notice of plant closings and layoffs. Although the House approved the bill overwhelmingly last week, a two-thirds vote in each chamber would be necessary to override a veto.    Prospects for further trade legislation this year are uncertain. President Reagan told lawmakers he would like to have a trade bill without certain items to which he objected -- principally the plant-closings provision -- but congressional leaders have threatened not to push through a stripped-down version. Some Democrats say procedural difficulties make a second bill unlikely; others prefer to preserve the trade and plant-closing issues for this fall's election campaigns.    &quot;Another bill is not wired, and those who are gambling on that are gambling on a weak reed,&quot; Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) said yesterday.    The 1,000-page trade bill is designed to force the U.S. to take tougher action to open foreign markets. The bill, the product of a long and complicated House-Senate conference, would provide nearly $1 billion in worker retraining and other benefits, increase presidential options for relief to domestic industries battered by imports and broaden the president's authority to engage in trade talks.    The bill, including the provision generally requiring 60 days' notice of layoffs and plant closings, originally passed the Senate last July on a 71-27 vote, with 19 Republicans supporting it. But yesterday, the Democrats could get only 11 Republicans to vote for it.    Before the vote yesterday, Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas said a &quot;no&quot; vote would demonstrate &quot;strong support&quot; for the president, although he acknowledged it would be a &quot;difficult vote&quot; for many senators.    Lawmakers voting against the bill criticized the plant-closing provision; some also complained that the bill would cost the federal government $7 billion over five years.    &quot;It's a good vote, but not enough to overcome a veto,&quot; conceded Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), who managed the bill on the Senate floor.    &quot;I believe that this bill is dead,&quot; Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) said after the vote. &quot;This bill just couldn't carry&quot; the plant-closing provision, he said. &quot;We must face reality, and the chance to override the president's veto is nil.&quot;    On the prospects for a streamlined bill, Sen. Bentsen said, &quot;It's going to be exceedingly difficult to do.&quot; The Senate Finance Committee chairman suggested that it wouldn't be the Democrats' fault if landmark trade legislation isn't enacted. &quot;I'm not sure they (the White House) want a bill,&quot; he said.    After the vote, the White House reiterated President Reagan's intention to veto the bill. But White House aides said Mr. Reagan remains interested in working out a trade bill he can sign this year, and they said the president's veto message will stress that willingness.    That is important because the Reagan administration persuaded some lawmakers to vote against the bill by convincing them that it would push for a more acceptable measure later. Thus, Mr. Reagan's veto message is likely to cite only a limited number of problems with the bill.    &quot;If the veto message has a short list, it would be an encouraging sign from the administration,&quot; said Sen. Danforth, who voted for the bill. &quot;If it's a long list, that clearly would be a sign to the Congress that the administration isn't serious about trade legislation this year.&quot;    The Democrats' efforts were harmed yesterday when they were unable to cut provisions restricting the export of Alaskan oil from the bill. They had hoped that dropping those provisions would win them the votes of the two Republican senators from Alaska. But Republicans wouldn't grant the unanimous consent required to bring up a special procedural motion.    Moreover, to dissuade the two senators from voting for the bill, the administration agreed to cite the Alaskan oil provision in the veto message and to oppose it in any new bill.    The Democrats also didn't win the votes of all the oil-state Republicans, which they had hoped to do because of the bill's repeal of the windfall profits tax on domestic crude oil. &quot;As bad as I want that, and as serious as it is, I won't vote for something bad or risky for America's economic growth for that,&quot; Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) said. &quot;We don't need it that bad.&quot;    President Reagan met with several Republicans, especially those who were undecided on the matter, in the past couple days. For example, Sen. David Karnes (R., Neb.) hadn't stated a position on the trade bill until yesterday morning, when he met with the president, Vice President George Bush, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and Treasury Secretary James Baker for 30 minutes in the Oval Office.    &quot;The point of the meeting was that he (President Reagan) does plan to immediately introduce -- maybe with his veto message -- a new trade bill that he hopes can get through the House and the Senate and that he is prepared to sign,&quot; said Sen. Karnes, who voted against the bill. &quot;I think he is very aware that we need to have trade legislation.&quot;    One Democrat, Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin, voted against the legislation. He said it weakens anti-bribery laws.    Administration strategists, jubilant about the 36 negative votes, said a couple of the Republicans who voted for the bill would have voted &quot;no&quot; if it had been necessary to bring the negative total up to 34.    The bill is a House-Senate compromise based on two measures that passed both chambers last year. Many special-interest provisions were dropped, shifting the debate from one of protectionism vs. free trade to one of government controls on business, particularly the plant-closing provision.    Current administration thinking is that the veto message, likely to be delivered to Congress next week, should stress a willingness to accept the &quot;pure trade&quot; portions of the bill, such as those dealing with unfair-trade complaints and retaliation. But it's likely the message will criticize the &quot;non-trade&quot; portions, including the plant-closings section and some items still viewed as special-interest provisions.    Of these, farm-subsidy increases may be listed, along with the Alaska oil restrictions.    Administration officials say the main legislators involved in trade -- Sen. Bentsen and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee -- are willing to work out a new bill centered on the &quot;pure trade&quot; provisions over which their committees have jurisdiction. Those two lawmakers have been committed for a year and a half to enacting trade legislation rather than creating a political issue over trade.    Moreover, Washington's business lobbies want a second bill, and the administration sees political advantages to one.    But much will depend on whether the Democratic leaders of Congress, especially House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas), think it's in their interest to cooperate on a second bill.    Administration officials will have to navigate some tricky political shoals over the next couple of weeks.    James Baker and Howard Baker, who favor a second bill and have told congressional leaders so, must deflect efforts by administration conservatives such as Chief Economic Adviser Beryl Sprinkel to construct a sweeping veto message that could anger congressional fence-sitters.    Then the administration must strike a balance between trying to strip the bill of numerous items to which it objects and keeping faith with earlier statements that it would accept a largely similar measure.    In the past, the administration has expressed objection to provisions that would provide special assistance to workers displaced because of imports; would call for sanctions against Toshiba Corp. because of a subsidiary's sale of sensitive technology to the Soviets; and would make mandatory some trade retaliation against foreign countries.    The Reagan administration will face pressure from Republicans to work out a compromise with Congress so that trade won't be a major issue in the elections this fall.    &quot;If you take out plant closings, I will do everything in my power to deliver the votes,&quot; Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), said. &quot;If the president doesn't like it, that will be too bad.&quot;    The administration also will be under pressure to work with Congress to get the trade package it really wants: congressional approval of the recently concluded U.S.-Canada trade pact. Sen. Bentsen said the struggle over the trade bill in coming weeks will slow congressional consideration of that agreement.    ---                     The Trade Bill   Major provisions of the trade bill include:   -- Requiring presidential action against unfair trade barriers imposed by other countries   -- Increasing presidential options for relief to domestic industries harmed by imports   -- Expanding the president's authority to engage in trade talks   -- Providing nearly $1 billion in worker retraining and other benefits   -- Requiring employers to give workers 60-day notice of plant closings and layoffs   -- Repealing the windfall profits tax on domestic crude oil</TEXT></DOC>
