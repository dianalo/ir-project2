ECS flow is a major inputto the FLOOD code which calculates reactor ECS power limits. The FLOODcode assesses the effectiveness of the ECS cooling capacity by modelingthe core and plenum hydraulics under accident conditions. Presently,reactor power is not limited by the ECS cooling capacity (power limit).However, the manual calculations of ECS flows had been recently updatedto include piping changes (debris strainer, valve changes, pressure releasesystems) and update fitting losses. Both updates resulted in reducedcalculated ECS flows. Upon completion of the current program to update,validate, and document, reactor power may be limited under certain situationsby ECS cooling capacity for some present reactor charge designs. A seriesof special hydraulic tests (Reference 1, 3) were conducted in L-Areausing all sources of emergency coolant including the ECS pumps (Reference2). The tests provided empirical hydraulic data on the ECS piping. Thesedata will be used in computer models of the system as well as manualcalculations of ECS flows. The improved modeling and accuracy of theflow calculations will permit reactor operation at the highest safe powerlevel with respect to an ECS power limit.</TEXT></DOC>
