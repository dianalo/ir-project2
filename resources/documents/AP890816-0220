Factory use held steady at 83.6 percent last month afterdeclining 0.3 percentage point in June, the central bank said. Therate hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent last December. Last month'soperating rate was down from 83.7 percent a year earlier.   The closer U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, thegreater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leadingto shortages and price increases. Analysts generally consider anoperating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication ofinflationary pressures.   The central bank has been straddling a fine line of keepinginterest rates high enough to cool inflationary pressures withoutslowing growth so much that the economy slides into a recession. Itbegan letting rates drop in June as inflation seemed to lessen.   The Federal Reserve said its industrial production index in Julystood at 141.7 percent of its 1977 base, up from 141.4 percent inJune.   The 0.2 percent increase last month came after revised 0.1percent drops in both May and June. Those were the first downturnssince the index fell 0.2 percent in February, which had been thefirst drop in a year.   But the Fed said the July gain mainly reflected a rebound in theoutput of raw materials and continued strength in business equipmentexcluding autos.   ``In contract, automoobile and truck production fell sharply, andoutput of construction supplies, on balance, remained weak,'' itsaid.   Production at manufacturing plants making both durable andnon-durable goods rose 0.2 percent. Output was up 0.3 percent atmines and oil wells and 0.8 percent at utilities.   The factory operating rate dipped 0.1 percentage point to 83.9percent at manufacturing plants, down from June's revised 84percent. The rate had peaked at 84.7 percent in January.   The rate at factories producing durable goods _ big-ticket itemsexpected to last more than three years _ fell 0.3 percentage pointfrom 82.6 percent in June.   The rate at factories producing nondurable goods rose to 86.2percent, from 86.1 percent in June.</TEXT></DOC>
