Judge Harold Greene's ruling last Friday, which bans by Jan. 1 certain discriminatory practices of the seven regional Bell companies, could prompt a massive recall of Bell telephone credit cards. It also could trigger adjustments in revenue collections at pay phones and big windfalls to such long-distance competitors as MCI Communications Corp.    The Bells are being ordered to treat MCI and other long-distance competitors of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. more fairly. Since the breakup of ATandamp;T in 1984, the problem has been that Bell credit cards and pay phones generally have routed long-distance calls to the former parent, even if the customer subscribes to different long-distance companies.    Pacific Telesis Group, like other Bell companies, is studying two options for resolving its dilemma with telephone credit cards. An attorney for Pacific Telesis said one option calls for the company to recall all credit cards and issue new ones that would be good only for local phone calls. The other alternative is to retrieve only the cards of people who don't subscribe to ATandamp;T.    Pacific Telesis estimates that the changes will cost about $7 million to make. Other regional Bells declined to provide cost estimates, but they are expected to be similar in magnitude.    U S West Inc., Denver, said another option for Bell companies would be to label clearly each telephone credit card so that consumers would know that long-distance telephone service was being supplied by ATandamp;T.    U S West also is considering sending credit card holders a memo informing them that ATandamp;T supplies long-distance service for the company's national and international telephone calls.    The pay phone and credit card issues are among the last of the major equal-access issues that MCI, based in Washington, and other long-distance competitors have been fighting to resolve. Even so, it may take a couple of years before the pay phone customer can select a long-distance carrier.    &quot;It's one of the last entanglements of divestiture,&quot; said a spokeswoman for San Francisco's Pacific Telesis Group.    Pay phones may be the biggest bone of contention. The Bell companies own about 1.7 million pay phones in the U.S. and route about $1 billion a year in long-distance business to ATandamp;T. If MCI -- which currently claims a 15% share of the overall long-distance market nationwide -- were to capture 10% to 20% of the pay phone business, it could ultimately boost revenue by as much as $200 million.    The ruling shouldn't have come as a surprise to the Bell companies. The Justice Department warned them in February that their credit card and pay phone practices were viewed by the government as discriminatory. Since then, the Bell companies have been studying ways to resolve the problem.    As an interim remedy, Judge Greene has asked the Bell companies to mail long-distance service selection ballots to owners of the premises on which pay phones are located. The owners would choose the long-distance carriers for the phone booths.    Robert Morris, a telecommunications analyst for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said GTE Corp., Stamford, Conn., is pushing a radical proposal that calls for long-distance companies to enter bids to provide long-distance service on pay phones. The lowest bidder would become the long-distance service provider.    Eventually, to comply with Judge Greene's order, the Bell companies would be required to develop software that would allow a consumer to select any long-distance carrier.    Another problem with pay phones is distributing coins collected from long-distance calls. One method of allocating coins would be to divvy revenue from long-distance coin calls according to market share. For instance, if ATandamp;T has 80% of the market in a particular pay phone area, then it would receive 80% of the coin revenue generated from pay phone long-distance telephone calls.    Tom Gray, senior director at Ameritech, Chicago, said his company has a simple solution for coin revenue: Award each long-distance company the exact amount for long-distance calls made. The problem, however, is that many Bell companies haven't developed the software to track long-distance calls on pay phones.    John Worthington, chief counsel for MCI Communications, expressed skepticism about the Bells' willingness to cooperate. &quot;The Bells are great people for seeing vast technical difficulties,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
