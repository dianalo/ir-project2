Thecancellation of magnetic fields can be interpreted as: (a) submergence(b) reconnection, or (c) dissipation (annihilation) of magnetic fields.Large-scale filaments are observed to form in the chromosphere immediatelyabove the boundaries between areas of network magnetic field of oppositepolarity where network cancellation occurs. Small-scale filaments developin association with small-scale cancelling magnetic fields at the rateof hundreds per day. Magnetic fields associated with large-scale solarconvection cells, known as intranetwork magnetic fields, can be detectedeverywhere on the visible disk of the sun by using the videomagnetographto integrate successive, 1/15 sec. magnetic field images for intervalsof 1 to 10 minutes. The intranetwork fields appear to be a few secondsof arc in diameter, and have field strengths of the order of a few gaussto tens of gauss. The intranetwork fields appear to originate at thecenters of supergranules and flow to the boundaries of the cells in approximatelyradial patterns.</TEXT></DOC>
