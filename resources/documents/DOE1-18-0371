This paper describes the use of Artificial Intelligencetechnologies in the automated analysis of the formal algebraic specificationsof abstract data types. These technologies include symbolic executionof specifications using techniques of automated deduction and machinelearning through the use of examples. On-going research into the roleof knowledge representation and problem solving in the process of developingsoftware is also discussed. 33 references.</TEXT></DOC>
