The container has a cap structure      which is removable by torsion applied through the overcap positioned over      the cap structure, engageable with the adjacent container neck portion,      and simultaneously rotatable as well as axially movable relative thereto.      As the overcap is rotated relative to the neck portion, ribs in the      overcap engage tip portions of a wing member associated with the cap      structure. Since the cap structure is mounted over and sealed about a      frangible web located around the container mouth that is located at the      distal end of the neck portion, when sufficient torsion develops, the web      is fractured, the cap is removed, and the container is opened. In opening      the container, force upon walls of the liquid-filled body portion of the      container is minimized. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to a hermetically sealed container having a unitary      closure cap and provided with a threadably engaged overcap for torsional      removal of the cap without squeezing the container itself. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Hermetically sealed containers made by a form-fill-and-seal process are      known. The closure portion for such containers incorporates a unitary but      removable cap situated over a container mouth at the neck portion distal      end. The cap is removable by fracturing, with manually applied force, a      frangible unitary web located between the cap and the container neck      portion. The container manufacturing technique is well known, and is      described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,176,153 to Weiler et al. </PAR><PAR>  Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,258,867 to Weiler et al. describes one      such container which can be formed, filled with a liquid, and then sealed,      all under continuous, commercial scale, high speed, sterile, manufacturing      conditions. </PAR><PAR>  For reasons associated with a desire to provide a container the contents of      which can be manually compressed and distorted as an aid for dispensing a      liquid fill, the walls of such a container are typically made as thin as      practical. However, a problem arises when one follows the normal or      intended procedure for opening such a container with manually applied      force. The applied force inherently involves gripping while compressing,      at least in part, the container itself. Consequently, when frangible web      fracture occurs loosening the container cap, liquid contents of the      container surge out through the opened container mouth before the user can      relinquish the applied force. This surge usually results in an undesirable      spillage and wastage of some of the liquid contents. </PAR><PAR>  It would be desirable to have a hermetically sealed container that can be      opened by fracturing the frangible web without using an applied force      which results in such a wasteful liquid contents surge. The present      invention fulfills such need. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention provides a new and useful dispenser comprising, in      combination, a hermetically sealed container and a cooperative hollow      overcap rotatably and threadably engaged with the container closure.      Rotation of the overcap relative to the container produces relative axial      movement and torsion which removes the container cap without compressive      forces being applied to the container body. Thereafter, the overcap      directs fill liquid discharge by means of a built-in nozzle. Such      dispensers are useful, inter alia, for single use douche and enema      compositions. Configuration of the built-in nozzle is determined by the      contemplated end use. </PAR><PAR>  The sealed container includes a body portion, a unitary neck portion      extending outwardly from the body portion and terminating distally in a      container mouth, and a closure portion about the mouth and unitary      therewith. The closure portion includes a unitary cap positioned over the      mouth and a frangible web that joins the cap to the neck portion about the      mouth. </PAR><PAR>  The container neck portion adjacent to container body portion additionally      has external screw threads formed therein. These threads can be      left-handed or right-handed, and extend circumferentially about an outside      wall portion thereof. The threads are longitudinally spaced from the      container mouth for a predetermined distance. </PAR><PAR>  The overcap is elongated, hollow, and in the assembled dispenser covers      both the closure portion and also adjacent regions of the neck portion.      The overcap is rotatable about the neck portion by virtue of internal      screw threads which are threadably engageable with the neck portion screw      threads. The overcap also has longitudinally extending, peripherally      spaced internal rib means adjacent to but inwardly from the internal      threads. </PAR><PAR>  The unitary container closure cap has radially outwardly extending wing      means that are engageable by the longitudinally extending unitary rib      means on an inside surface of the overcap. The overcap is first threadably      received on the neck portion before the wing means or members come to rest      against and engage such rib means. Further advancement of the overcap onto      the neck portion by threading twists the wing means and severs the unitary      closure cap from the container. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, threading of the overcap onto the neck portion applies torsion upon      the cap by coaction of closure wing means with the overcap rib means. This      torsion fractures the frangible web, thereby separating the closure cap      from the container mouth, and thus opening the container without a      distorting force being exerted upon the body portion of the container. </PAR><PAR>  Once the container has been so opened, the hollow overcap, if provided with      a through passageway, can perform yet another function. While a sealing      engagement is provided between the overcap and the neck portion in the      region of the engaged threads, the overcap itself then provides a fill      liquid distribution and dispensing nozzle. In this manner, delivery and      discharge of fill liquid from the container can be localized and directed      to a desired delivery site or location, such as in a body cavity, or the      like. </PAR><PAR>  Various other and further features, embodiments, and the like which are      associated with the present invention will become apparent and better      understood to those skilled in the art from the present description      considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein presently      preferred embodiments of the invention are illustrated by way of example.      It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings and the      associated accompanying portions of this specification are provided for      purposes of illustration and description only, and are not intended as      limitations on the invention. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  In the drawings: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an enema dispenser embodying this invention      and showing a hermetically sealed container in association with a hollow,      cooperative overcap, the overcap being shown in phantom for illustration      purposes; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an end elevational view of the container of FIG. 1 wherein lower      portions of the liquid holding vessel portion of such container are broken      away, and wherein the overcap is removed; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a top plan view of the container of FIG. 1 with the overcap      removed; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 2, but showing the overcap in cooperative      association with the container neck portion and closure portion and with      the overcap rotated to the position where overcap ribs first engage cap      wings, some parts thereof being broken away, and the overcap being shown      in longitudinal section; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a transverse sectional view taken along the plane 5--5 of FIG. 4; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a fragmentary view similar to FIG. 4, but showing the relative      position of the overcap in relation to the assembled container neck      portion and closure portion after the frangible web has been fractured and      the cap separated from the mouth of the neck portion by rotation of the      overcap relative to the neck portion, some parts thereof being broken      away; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a fragmentary side elevational view of the dispenser wherein the      overcap is in functional association with a cooperative cover; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a sectional elevation of the dispenser portion shown in FIG. 7; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a perspective view of a douche dispenser embodying this invention      showing a hermetically sealed container in association with a cooperating      overcap, the overcap being shown partially in phantom for illustration      purposes; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a fragmentary elevational view of the container of FIG. 9      wherein the overcap is removed; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is a top plan view of the container of FIG. 10; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is an view, enlarged fragmentary that of partly in section, showing      the overcap of FIG. 10 in cooperative association with the container neck      portion and closure portion, and with the overcap rotated to the position      wherein overcap ribs first engage cap wings; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 is a transverse sectional view taken along the plane 13--13 of FIG.      12; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 is a fragmentary view similar to FIG. 12 showing the relative      position of the overcap in relation to the assembled container neck      portion and closure portion after the frangible web has been fractured and      the unitary cap separated from the container neck portion by rotation of      the overcap relative to the neck portion; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 15 is a view similar to FIG. 4, but showing an alternative embodiment      of the overcap; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16 is a side elevational view showing an alternative embodiment of the      overcap in association with an alternative embodiment of a hermetically      sealed container, portions of the overcap being broken away to show      interior detail. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 1 through 7, enema dispenser 14 embodying this invention      comprises a hermetically sealed container 15 and an overcap 34 associated      therewith. Container 15 is of unitary construction and includes a body      portion 16 whose walls are relatively thin and which define a      liquid-holding cavity 17. Body portion 16 and cavity 17 can have any      convenient or desired configuration. The container configuration shown,      however, is presently preferred, particularly with the body portion 16      sized to fit into the palm of an average or typical adult human hand. The      walls of body portion 16 are relatively thin so that body portion 16 can      be manually squeezed, i.e., compressed and distorted to dispense a liquid      fill therefrom. </PAR><PAR>  Container 15 can be molded using a thermoplastic polymer. Presently      preferred such polymers are low density polyethylene (LDPE), very low      density polyethylene (VLDPE), polypropylene (PP), and the like. The      thickness of the walls of vessel portion 16 can vary from one location to      another, but are preferably formed as thin as practical, consistent with      structural strength requirements. </PAR><PAR>  Container 15 can be made by a parison molding procedure wherein body      portion 16 is formed first, then charged with a desired liquid fill, and      thereafter immediately sealed by formation of the neck and closure      portions of the container 15. The forming, filling, and sealing operations      are carried out automatically under sterile conditions using the      procedures known to the art. </PAR><PAR>  One end 18 of body portion 16 terminates in a tapered neck portion 19 which      is unitary with body portion 16. Neck portion 19 defines therein a mouth      21 (see FIG. 6) at the distal end 22 thereof. A channel 24 extends between      such mouth 21 and cavity 17 in neck portion 19 to provide communication      with body portion 16. The neck portion 19 and the body portion 16 usually      are positioned substantially symmetrically about a common longitudinal      axis, as shown. </PAR><PAR>  External screw threads 26 are formed about the periphery of neck portion      19. The threads 26 extend circumferentially outwardly about an outside      wall region 27 of neck portion 19. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the region      27 is adjacent the proximal end or base 28 of neck portion 19. The      threaded region 27 has a relatively larger diameter than the unthreaded      distal part of neck portion 19. External screw threads 26 begin on the      neck portion at a location that is in longitudinally spaced relationship      to mouth 21 toward container body portion 16. Screw threads 26 can be      left-handed or right-handed, as desired. </PAR><PAR>  A unitary closure portion 29 for container 15 is located at distal end 22      of neck portion 19. Closure portion 29 includes a removable, but initially      unitary closure cap 31 which overlies and seals the mouth 21. The cap 31      can have various configurations, but the cylindrical form shown is      presently preferred. Frangible web 32 that is unitary with cap 31 and      distal end 22 is located about the mouth 21. Closure portion 29 also      includes an upstanding wing member 33 unitary therewith that extends      radially outwardly from the longitudinal axis of neck portion 19. The wing      member 33 can have various configurations, but the longitudinally      flattened form shown is presently preferred. </PAR><PAR>  A separately formed, elongated and hollow overcap 34 (see FIG. 4) defines a      central passage having an entry orifice 20 and a dispensing orifice 38 and      is positioned in the assembled container 15 over the closure portion 29      and also over at least an adjacent part of neck portion 19. Preferably,      and as shown, overcap 34 extends from the distal end 22 of neck portion 19      to the proximal end 28 thereof. Overcap 34 can be made of a relatively      rigid molded thermoplastic polymer, such as ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA),      or the like. Such thermoplastic polymer can be pigmented, as is presently      preferred, to contrast the appearance thereof in relation to the preferred      transparent or translucent appearance of container 15. </PAR><PAR>  The overcap defines a nozzle means through which liquid contents from body      portion 16 is dispensed after mouth 21 is opened. The nozzle means is      provided by a unitary, forwardly extending tubular stem extension 36 which      projects axially from the distal terminus 40 of the skirt portion 37 of      overcap 34. The free or distal end of tubular stem extension 36 terminates      in a dispensing orifice 38. </PAR><PAR>  Overcap 34 at its skirt portion 37 is provided with internal screw threads      39 about an inside region 41 adjacent to orifice 20. The overcap screw      threads 39 are threadably engageable with the neck portion screw threads      26. </PAR><PAR>  Ribs 42 are peripherally spaced from one another along the inside wall of      overcap 34 and extend radially inwardly to surround neck portion 19 above      threaded region 27. Ribs 42 are adapted to engage wing member 33 of      closure cap 31 upon threaded engagement of overcap 34 with neck portion      19. The ribs 42 preferably extend longitudinally somewhat above the mouth      21 when the overcap 34 is fully threadably engaged with the neck portion      19 as shown, for example, in FIG. 6. An opposed pair of the ribs 42 is      preferably arranged so that each rib thereof is abuttable against a      different radially opposed edge part of the wing member 33 when the      overcap 34 is threadably engaged over the neck portion 19 and the overcap      34 is rotated relative to the neck portion 19 to achieve a position such      as illustrated, for example, in FIGS. 4 and 5. At least one pair of ribs      42 is present. Preferably four ribs, evenly spaced about the inner      periphery of overcap 34, are used so that not more than about one quarter      of one full 360.degree. turn or rotation of overcap 34 relative to      container 15 is needed before wing member 33 comes into abutting      engagement with a pair of opposed ribs 42. </PAR><PAR>  For purposes of achieving symmetrical torque application against wing      member 33, at least two opposed ribs 42 should be used, and such a rib      pair in the embodiment shown is located with respective ribs of such pair      being at diametrically opposed locations in overcap 34 so that each such      rib 42 is engageable with a different opposite side extension of the wing      member 33 (see, for illustration, FIG. 5). Each rib 42 preferably has      generally straight, radially inwardly extending sides to provide      complementary surface areas thereof which abut against, and are slidably      engageable upon axial movement relative to the opposite side extensions of      the wing member 33. The longitudinal distance between the beginning of      overcap screw threads 39 and the inner overcap region 43 along ribs 42      where such opposite side extensions of wing member 33 initially abut when      the threadable engagement between neck portion screw threads 26 and      overcap screw threads 39 is achieved is at least equal to the longitudinal      distance across the neck portion screw threads 26 and region 27. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, when overcap 34 is positioned over closure portion 29 and neck      portion 19, and such threadable engagement between respective screw      threads 26 and 39 is begun, rotation of overcap 34 relative to neck      portion 19 in a direction which increases the amount of such threadable      engagement produces torsion upon the wing member 33 from ribs 42, thereby      creating an applied torque upon wing member 33 which is transmitted      through cap 31 and applied to frangible web 32. The torsion force which      develops during such relative rotation is sufficient to fracture web 32      and separate closure cap 31 from mouth 21, thereby opening container 15. </PAR><PAR>  The unthreaded region of neck portion 19 is generally circular in      cross-section about its longitudinal axis. The overcap 34 preferably      mounts about neck portion 19 for rotation about such longitudinal axis of      neck portion 19. Further, the cap 31 is preferably centered on such      longitudinal axis. Wing member 33 preferably extends diametrically through      such longitudinal axis and is adapted to engage at its lateral opposed      edge parts two of the ribs 42. </PAR><PAR>  After cap 31 is separated from mouth 21 by fracture of web 32 (see FIG. 6),      cap 31 can slide within overcap 34 along ribs 15 away from distal end 22      and mouth 21 so as to provide a free flow path for liquid exiting mouth 21      from container cavity 17, particularly when the mouth 21 is in an inverted      configuration relative to cavity 17. When container 15 is in an upright      position with mouth 21 uppermost after fracture of web 32, the cap 31 can      rest over mouth 21 (rest position not shown). Cap 31 also can act as a      check valve tending to limit return of dispensed liquid to mouth 21. </PAR><PAR>  Container 15 is opened by grasping the base or proximal end region 28 of      neck portion 19 between the fingers of one hand and turning (rotating) the      overcap 34 with the fingers of the other hand. Thus, no force need be      applied against vessel portion 16 during the procedure for opening mouth      21 by fracturing web 32. Alternatively, the container 5 itself can be      gently grasped while the overcap 34 is turned. </PAR><PAR>  After web 32 has been fractured by rotation of overcap 34 relative to neck      portion 19, the overcap 34 has so advanced into threadable engagement with      neck portion 19 that overcap 34 is sealingly engaged with neck portion 19      in the region of integrated screw threads 39 and 26 (see FIG. 6). The      screw threads 39 and 26 are preferably beveled or angled relative to each      so that such a sealing engagement therebetween is achieved at the point or      location where fracture of web 32 occurs. Also, when such a sealing      engagement is achieved, the proximal end 28 of overcap 34 rests against a      shelf-like projection formed in the proximal end region of neck portion 16      adjacent wall section 27. Thus, when the web 32 is fractured, liquid is      dispensed from cavity 17 through mouth 21 into the central channel defined      in overcap 34 when container 15 is squeezed and exits from the nozzle      opening 38. </PAR><PAR>  In general, the overcap 34 helps adapt a dispenser of this invention for      use in a given application. For example, overcap 34 with its stem      extension 36 adapts the dispenser 14 as it is duly comprised of the      combination of container 15 and overcap 34 for use in the administration      of enemas. For such a purpose, the stem extension 36 is preferably coated      with a lubricant (not shown), such as petroleum jelly, or the like. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred enema dispenser embodiment, the overcap 34 is initially      provided with an overfitting protective sleeve 44, such as shown in FIGS.      7 and 8. Sleeve 44 is closed at its distal end 46, but internally, at such      distal end 46 thereof, there is provided an axially inwardly projecting      barbed fitting or plug 47 which is configured to snap fit into the nozzle      orifice 38 in stem extension 36 of overcap 34 to keep sleeve 44 in place      until its removal. </PAR><PAR>  Although container 15 is shown with a neck portion 19 which is generally      axially aligned with the longitudinal axis of container body portion 16,      other neck arrangements can be used, if desired. For example, referring to      FIGS. 9 through 14, there is shown a douche dispenser 50 which      incorporates a hermetically sealed container 55 of similar design and a      cooperative overcap 54 carried on a neck portion 19' at an acute angle      with respect to the longitudinal axis of container body portion 16'. Such      container 55 is similar to container 15. Similar components thereof are      similarly numbered, but with the addition of prime marks thereto for      identification purposes. </PAR><PAR>  In container 55, a hollow elbow portion 51 is unitarily included, between      the base 28' of neck portion 19' and the adjoining end 18' of body portion      16' so that the neck portion 19' angularly extends from elbow portion 51,      as shown. The elbow portion 51 is provided with a channel 52 extending      lengthwise therethrough which interconnects the cavity 17' with the      channel 24'. To aid in rigidifying and strengthening neck portion 19', a      pair of opposed ribs 61 is provided between neck 52 and end 18, the ribs      61 being unitarily formed with neck portion 19' and body portion 16'. </PAR><PAR>  Container 55 utilizes an overcap 54 having plural dispensing apertures in      its tip. Like overcap 34, overcap 54 is provided with overcap screw      threads 39', and with ribs 42' that function in the same manner as      heretofore described. However, overcap 54 employs a different nozzle      means. Overcap 54 is tapered longitudinally in the region thereof between      the overcap screw threads 39' and the distal end 56 thereof. A plurality      of longitudinally extending, exterior grooves 57 are defined in exterior      or outer surface portions of overcap 54 (see FIG. 9). These grooves are      circumferentially spaced equidistant from one another and located adjacent      distal end 56. In overcap 54, four such equally spaced grooves, such as      grooves 57 and 58, are employed. One opposed pair of such grooves      identified as grooves 58 in FIG. 9, is substantially longer than the other      opposed pair of such grooves, identified as grooves 57 in FIG. 9. Along      the longitudinal bottom portion of each groove 58 two orifices 58A and 58B      (see FIGS. 9 andamp; 12) are provided. Similarly, orifice 57A is provided at the      proximal end of each groove 57. In grooves 58, orifice 58A is provided at      or near the distal end of each groove, and the second orifice 58B is      provided adjacent the proximal end of each such groove. The single orifice      57A in each groove 57 is located at a longitudinal position along overcap      54 which is about midway between the longitudinal position of each pair of      orifices 58A and 58B in each groove 58. </PAR><PAR>  The overcap 54 is adapted to be sealingly engaged with neck portion 19'      between the respective overcap screw threads 39' and neck portion screw      threads 26' at the position of overcap 54 relative to neck portion 19'      when fracture of frangible web 32' occurs while overcap 54 is threadably      engaged with neck portion 19' and rotated relative thereto. Thus, when web      32' is fractured by torsion, and liquid exits mouth 21' from cavity 17',      such liquid is generally uniformly dispensable from the individual      orifices 58 particularly when the neck portion 19' is inverted relative to      vessel portion 17' and the body portion 16' is manually compressed. </PAR><PAR>  The dispenser 50 comprised of container 55 and associated overcap 54 is      well adapted for use as a female douche, as those skilled in the dispenser      art will appreciate. </PAR><PAR>  However, if desired, the overcap 54 can be used in place of the overcap 34      in container 15, or the overcap 34 can be used in place of the overcap 54      in container 50. </PAR><PAR>  The circumstance that the free end of an overcap nozzle means can have a      configuration that is determined mainly by the contemplated use of a      dispenser of this invention is further illustrated by the two further      dispenser embodiments shown in FIGS. 15 and 16, respectively. In these      embodiments, the overcap and the container function similarly to the      overcap 34 and the container 15 in dispenser 14. Parts identified by      100-series or 200-series numerals that are similar to parts described      hereinabove have been assigned numerals having the same last two digits. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, in FIG. 15, there is seen a dispenser 110 having an overcap 134 which      is in cooperative threaded association with the neck portion 119 of a      previously hermetically sealed container 151. Overcap 134 is shown after      it has been rotated about neck portion 119 to the position shown in FIG.      15 where the frangible web 132 has been fractured and the cap 131 has been      thereby separated from the mouth 121 at the distal end 122 of neck portion      119 of container 151. </PAR><PAR>  Overcap 134 is provided with a unitary, forwardly extending tubular stem      extension 162 which protects axially from the distal terminus 140 of the      skirt portion 137 of overcap 134. The open distal end 163 of stem      extension 162 provides a dispensing orifice. Stem extension 162 is      additionally provided with unitary radially outwardly projecting,      circumferentially extending, axially spaced barbs 164 and 165 for      retaining thereon a flexible extension tube 166. Although two such barbs      164 and 165 are employed in stem 162 as shown, an embodiment of overcap      134 may contain more or less than two such barbs, if desired, and various      barb configurations may be used. Such barbs function to seal and seat      against contiguous interior surface portions of an elastomeric delivery      tube 166. End portion 167 of tube 166 is slidably extended over distal end      163 down to a position where it is in an axially spaced, adjacent      relationship to the distal terminus 140. The length of tube 166 can vary,      depending upon the end use application intended, for example, to permit      such liquid to be discharged at a desired location in an intestine      relatively remotely interiorly situated. Superficial gripping ribs 161 are      provided circumferentially about the exterior of skirt portion 137      adjacent the distal end of overcap 134. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16 depicts a dispenser 210 having an overcap 234 in cooperative      threaded association with hermetically sealed bellows container 251.      Overcap 234 is similar to overcap 34. Overcap 234 is shown after it has      been rotated about neck portion 219 to the position shown in FIG. 16 where      the frangible web 232 has been fractured and the cap 231 has been thereby      separated from the mouth 221 at the distal end 222 of neck portion 219 of      container 251. </PAR><PAR>  Overcap 234 is provided with a unitary forwardly extending tubular stem      extension 270 which projects axially from the distal terminus 240 of the      skirt portion 237 of overcap 234. The open, distal end 271 of stem      extension 270 provides a dispensing orifice. </PAR><PAR>  The container 251 has an axially collapsible bellows-type body 272 which is      unitary with the generally cylindrical neck portion 219. The body 272 is      formed with a series of circumferentially extending, axially adjacent,      flexible pleats 273 which permit body 272 to be collapsed upon application      of an axially exerted compressive force thereto once the cap 231 has been      separated from the mouth 221. </PAR><PAR>  Each of the dispensers 110 and 210 is provided with respective buttress      threads 126, 139 and 226, 239. Thus, each such thread has a forward face      which is perpendicular to the screw axis and whose back face is at an      angle to such axis so that such thread is both efficient in transmitting      power and strong. </PAR><PAR>  Although the present invention has been described and illustrated based on      the presently available information and embodiments, it is to be      understood that modifications and variations are within the spirit and      scope of the invention, as those skilled in the art will readily      appreciate and that such are within the purview and scope of the appended      claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
