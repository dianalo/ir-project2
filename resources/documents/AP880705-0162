The caller told the Voice of the Nation radio station thateither Americans Terry Anderson or Thomas Sutherland would beexecuted to avenge the downing of the Iran Air jetliner by a U.S.Navy missile cruiser in the Persian Gulf on Sunday.   The Sunni Moslem radio quoted the caller as saying the groupwould kill one hostage by 8 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) and dump the body inthe Syrian-policed seaside neighborhood of Ramlet al-Baida in westBeirut. But the deadline passed with no developments, police said.   ``We have patrols along the coastal boulevard where thekidnappers said they will throw the body. But we haven't receivedany report about any corpse,'' said the police spokesman, who spokeon condition of anonymity.   The caller did not elaborate and it was not possible toauthenticate the call.   Earlier Tuesday, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem cleric, SheikMohammed Hussein Fadlallah, said the 18 foreign hostages in Lebanonshould not pay the price for the U.S. Navy's action in the gulf.   ``I find no justification for making the hostages account for amatter with which they have no link,'' said Fadlallah, spiritualguide of Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be anumbrella for the underground factions holding 18 foreign hostages.   The statement was published by the Sohofiya News Agency, anewsletter based in west Beirut.   The United States said the USS Vincennes shot down the Iran Airjetliner on Sunday after mistaking it for a jet fighter. Iran saidall 290 people aboard were killed, and Iranian leaders vowed toseek revenge.   A State Department official in Washington, speaking on conditionof anonymity, said of the anonymous radio threat: ``There is noconfirmation there is any connection to Hezbollah or that this is alegitimate thing.''   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, has insisted that itsstatements would be typewritten and accompanied by a photograph ofa hostage to prove its authenticity.   In Cadiz, Ky., Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said she wasconcerned about the unconfirmed threat but tried to take ``somecomfort ... that Islamic Jihad has told us repeatedly that if aphotograph does not accompany the communication, then it's notofficial.''   On May 4, an anonymous caller purporting to speak for IslamicJihad called the Christian-run Voice of Lebanon radio to announcethat French captives Marcel Fontaine, Marcel Carton and Jean-PaulKauffmann would be freed. The three, who had been held by IslamicJihad, were freed several hours later.   By all accounts, the kidnappers and their hostages are penned upin a Shiite barracks in Beirut's southern slums by Syrian troopswho moved in last month to halt fighting between rival Palestinianmilitias.   Some observers believe that the militants have difficulty movingaround and may not be able to deliver statements as they used to do.   Anderson, 40, the chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, is the longest-held foreign captive in Lebanon.He was kidnapped in west Beirut March 16, 1985.   Sutherland, 57, the acting dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversitry of Beirut, was kidnapped June 9, 1985.   Also Tuesday, about 2,000 Hezbollah sympathizers marched throughwest Beirut's main streets, denouncing the U.S. attack.</TEXT></DOC>
