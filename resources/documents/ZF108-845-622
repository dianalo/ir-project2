 Itprovides LU6.2 transport capability, extends NetView Graphic Monitor Facilitysupport to VM/ESA, as well as offering enhancements to the current NetViewautomation capabilities.andP;  With the LU6.2 transport facility, users can writeapplications on non-SNA devices that communicate directly to NetView withoutgoing through intermediate service points.andP;  The new version of NetView alsoprovides SystemView automation services for the System/370 and System/390environments as well as NetView Graphic Monitor Facility which providesintegrated graphics and a new end-user interface that more easily enablesusers to access large quantities of information.andP;  This facility featuresgraphic support for monitoring SNA networks and resources from central systemand stand-alone system NetView, conforming to IBM's new SystemViewdefinition.andP;  The Netcenter graphic option provides customers with the abilityto monitor and control SNA and non-SNA resources from an MS-DOS graphicsworkstation.andP;  Netcenter host code is available to customers at no additionalcharge when they order NetView Version 2 for MVS/ESA or MVS/XA.andP;  NetViewBridge provides an interface to enable users to write NetView applicationsfor accessing and updating external databases.andP;  For example, an interface toIBM's Info/Management product is designed to enaable customers to automatetheir problem procedures more effectively.andP;  NetView Version 2 Release 2 forMVS/ESA and MVS/XA environments is scheduled to be available September 30,1991 - it comes out for the VSE environment December 31, 1991 and arrives forVM environments on March 31, 1992.andP;  Charges are as follows: Central systemNetView ranges from $437 to $5,760 for the monthly licence charge -distributed system NetView ranges from $251 to $3,315 for the monthly licencecharge while similar Stand-alone charges range from $289 to $3,815.andM;The 3172 controller attaches multi- vendor local networks toandM;EsconandM;The IBM 3172 Interconnect Controller announced earlier this year is acontroller that attaches multiple local area networks to multiple hostcomputers.andP;  It provides customers with a tool for integrating different kindsof local area networks with host computers using multiple operating systems.andO;It is IBM's first product to support the Fibre Distributed Data Interfacestandard for trans-mitting data at up to 100Mbps.andP;  This will help make itpossible for host computers and high-speed local area networks to share largeamounts of data.andP;  In addition, the 3172 Models 1 and 2 support IBM's SystemsNetwork Architecture and will support the Open Systems Interconnectionstandard.andP;  The 3172 will support the new Enterprise Systems ConnectionArchitecture - Escon - for transmission of data between host computers usingfast fibre optic communication lines spanning six miles.andM;Two versions of VTAM, one expands storage, the other supportsandM;FDDIandM;Along with controller enhancements, IBM issued new releases of VTAM.andP;  VTAMVersion 3 Release 3 for the new VSE/ESA and VM/ESA operating systems enablescustomers to use larger programs and build larger networks.andP;  For VM users,virtual storage capacity has been expanded from 16Mb to 2Gb of data, a125-fold improvement.andP;  VSE/ESA-users will find that VTAM now occupies its ownprivate address space on the host computer, thereby freeing up more space andaccommodating larger applications and more complex networks.andP;  VTAM Version 3Release 4 for MVS/ESA, VM/ESA and VM/SP operating systems supports directcommunication between host applications and SNA devices on several types oflocal area networks, including FDDI.andP;  In addition, this version of VTAMincreases the availability of networks by enabling customers to add devicesto networks without disrupting their operation.andP;  It also supports the 3172controller along with the newly unveiled Escon channel.andM;Two new 3174 controllers offer direct support for up to 64andM;devicesandM;The two newest 3174 Establishment Controller Models, 12L and 22L, support thenew System/390 Escon architecture, which can grant customers access toapplications and data on up to eight host computers through one fibre opticlink.andP;  This will improve productivity for end users and overall networkavailability.andP;  Customers using devices attached by coaxial cable can nowsupport up to 64 devices attached directly instead of the previous limit of32.andP;  Meanwhile, the new 3299 Terminal Multiplexer Model 32 enables attachmentof up to 32 devices to large 3174 models.andP;  It attaches to the 3174 usingfibre optic lines, as well as coaxial cabling and the IBM Cabling System.andO;For customers using Token-Ring local area networks, host access is alsoenhanced, since intelligent workstations on a Token-Ring Network can nowaccess up to three hosts concurrently through a single 3174 gateway.andO;Improved access to host computers also enables users to switch betweenapplications and information in local and remote hosts.andP;  There have been someimprovements to the 3745 Communication Controller via the new channeladaptor, which IBM claims means that users will discover a 25% improvementfor batch processing.andP;  And one day, the humble 3745 will support the newfibre optic Escon networking capability.andM;Token Ring announcements for network functionality, Ethernet management IBMToken Ring announcements included the 8230 Token-Ring Controlled Access Unitwhich is a device attachment unit that can identify and isolate amalfunctioning node, automatically recover, or remove and bypass the failingcomponent so that the network remains functional; and the enhanced 8209Ethernet Attachment Module that allows LAN Network Manager to manageToken-Ring nets connected through an Ethernet local network.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
