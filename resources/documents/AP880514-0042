Taiwan said it wasweighing charges against the men.   The report indicated that the hijackers' knowledge of air routesfoiled an attempt by the pilot to fly the Boeing 737 to Hong Kongrather than land in Taiwan, seat of the rival Nationalistgovernment.   In Taiwan, the country's chief security agency recommended todaythat the two hijackers be prosecuted. The Taiwan Garrison Commandsaid the two violated Taiwan's civil aviation code.   If charged with hijacking, the men could face the death penalty.   The air pirates, Zhang Qingguo, 27, a worker at an arsenal inYunnan province, and Long Guiyin, 26, a steelworker from Guizhouprovince, have been granted political asylum in Taiwan.   They comandeered the plane Thursday about an hour after it leftthe southeast coastal city of Xiamen for Canton on a domesticflight.   The plane, escorted by Taiwanese jet fighters, landed atTaiwan's Qingquangan Air Force Base. It was refueled and flew backto Xiamen, 136 miles across the Taiwan Straits, to end thenine-hour ordeal for the 105 passengers and 11 crew members aboard.   The China Daily said Zhang and Long first overpowered theplane's security guard with a dagger and what appeared to be a gun.They wrapped the chief flight attendant, who tried to set off analarm, and another attendant in a cotton curtain and threatened toblow up the plane with explosives.   After entering the cockpit, they covered the heads of the radiooperator and co-pilot with plastic bags, it said.   An earlier report by the official China News Service said thehijackers covered the head of the pilot, Yang Yongling, and toldhim they had guns and knives. Zhang later told a televisioninterviewer in Taiwan that he had a toy pistol and fake explosives.   As the plane entered Hong Kong air space, Yang tried to trickthe hijackers and land there, but the two realized his ploy andforced him to continue toward Taiwan, the China Daily said.   In Taipei, Taiwan, officials said the director of the TaiwanGarrison Command's court martial division had recommended that thehijackers be prosecuted for endangering flight safety, a chargethat carries a maximum penalty of 7 years in jail.   Command officials refused to say whether the mroe severe chargeof hijacking might also apply.   Liu Ching-yi, presiding judge at the Taipei District Court, toldreporters the court would consider the charge with compassionbecause of the hijackers' motives.   The garrison command delivered to the court a statement by thetwo hijackers, saying they hijacked the plane because they detestedthe ``brutal rule of the Chinese communists'' and wanted to seekfreedom in Taiwan.   It was the second time a commercial Chinese airliner washijacked to outside the mainland. Six Chinese commandeered aTrident owned by the Civil Aviation Administration to South Koreain May 1983.   They were imprisoned in South Korea for a little more than ayear, then released and allowed to go to Taiwan.</TEXT></DOC>
