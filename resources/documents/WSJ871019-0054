Fueled by $1-a-week donations from a rapidly growing number of the union's 1.8 million members, the Teamsters' political-action committee receipts grew at a torrid rate of 240% in each of the past two elections and show no signs of slowing this year.    Already in 1987 the PAC has dispensed campaign donations to 114 House and Senate candidates, plus a $5,000 gift to the presidential campaign of Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.). Four other presidential candidates rallied recently to defend the union when word leaked out that the Justice Department was considering filing an anti-racketeering lawsuit to replace the union's indicted president, Jackie Presser, with a court-appointed trustee. Other defenders included Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who got a $2,000 personal-appearance fee from the PAC this year, and Rep. William Clay (D., Mo.), who got $18,500 from the PAC in the past 4 1/2 years for lightly contested re-election campaigns.    Teamster officials reluctantly concede they expect receipts exceeding $8 million during the 1987-88 election cycle. A projection of receipts on the basis of their recent growth, however, points to a total topping $10 million, unprecedented for any business or labor group. Neither of the reigning giants, the National Association of Realtors or the American Medical Association, expects to top $6 million.    The engine of the Teamsters' remarkable growth is voluntary checkoff agreements through which employers withhold PAC donations from the paychecks of union members who agree.    The potential for growth is enormous. Only about 18% of the membership, the largest of any union, now contributes to the PAC. Officials say roughly 80% of the income is through automatic payroll deductions rather than more sporadic donations by check or hat-passing. The union has checkoff agreements in its master freight-hauling agreement and in contracts with auto haulers and the United Parcel Service covering a total of 425,000 employees. It is currently pushing for checkoff agreements in contracts covering hundreds of thousands of additional members in the brewing industry and warehousing. A Baltimore local recently said 1,000 new members had signed up since the first of the year.    Mr. Presser made a top priority of the PAC, formerly a weakling among $1 million giants. The aim is to have more influence in Washington. &quot;It puts you on the game board,&quot; says Paul Locigno, the union's director of governmental affairs.    Members give because they are worried about their jobs and a &quot;pervasive anti-union climate,&quot; Mr. Locigno says. In its promotional materials, the PAC stresses bread-and-butter issues. &quot;Put the brakes on deregulation,&quot; says one flier, portraying a graveyard where the headstones are inscribed with names of unionized truck lines that have gone under.    A pamphlet aimed at brewery workers says the PAC will fight increased excise taxes on beer, which it says &quot;could mean fewer jobs.&quot; Another warns that members could lose jobs if they flunk polygraph, or &quot;lie detector,&quot; tests, which would be outlawed in the workplace under a bill supported by the Teamsters and other unions.    Job security has also become an issue for Mr. Presser and the union's executive board. Federal prosecutors are pondering a suit seeking their removal on the ground they are controlled by organized crime, something the union denies. The President's Commission on Organized Crime identified the union as one of four controlled or influenced by mobsters. A former Teamsters president, Roy Williams, jailed on a bribery conviction, testified this year that he took orders from the Kansas City mob while in office. Mr. Presser faces a federal trial on charges of embezzling $700,000 in union funds to pay three union employees who didn't do any work.    Despite such notoriety, politicians of both parties swarmed to attack any suit to put a trustee in control of the union. At a September rally in Cincinnati to map strategy to thwart such a suit, Republican presidential candidate Jack Kemp appeared at Mr. Presser's side saying he was &quot;honored to stand in solidarity on this issue.&quot; GOP candidate Alexander Haig appeared, too, saying, &quot;I am always at home with the Teamsters.&quot; Democratic hopeful Jesse Jackson brought union members to their feet by declaring it was the Reagan administration that deserved to be put in trusteeship. Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.), who's also a presidential candidate, sent a videotape in which he said, &quot;I will be with you all the way on this.&quot; Sen. Hatch also sent a video, saying a lawsuit is &quot;ludicrous even to contemplate.&quot;    And Rep. Clay urged the union to redouble its political efforts. &quot;Become a force so potent and awesome that your fate won't depend on those who come begging for your support during election time and abandon your agenda thereafter,&quot; he said.    The union says its strategy for heading off the suit includes letters, telephone calls and meetings with lawmakers. The Justice Department reports getting more than 80 calls and letters from senators, congressmen and their aides about the matter. A department spokesman says those won't influence anything, however.    The union has endorsed Republicans Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon for president in the past. But in congressional races the union's PAC gives overwhelmingly to Democrats -- 87.6% in the 1986 campaigns. It also gave $161,000 to national Democratic Party organizations, and only $22,000 to Republican Party groups.    Federal law prohibits PACs from giving any federal candidate more than $5,000 per election, so even considering primaries, the Teamsters will soon have more money than they can legally give in House and Senate contests. PAC officials deny any plans to launch independent spending campaigns -- which could skirt the limit on direct donations -- though some political consultants say the union is quietly exploring the idea.    PAC officials say much of their money will go to state and local candidates. &quot;If a driver backs out onto a thoroughfare and gets a ticket, he expects his union to have some influence back at city hall,&quot; says union lobbyist David Sweeney.    ---               Top Recipients of Teamster Money                         (1983-1987)    Rep.
