No one wasreported injured in the blasts.   In the cocaine center of Medellin, the 4th Army Brigade said itarrested 28 leftist guerrillas and ``bandits'' it accused of workingfor drug traffickers.   The brigade, in a statement made public today, said the suspectsbelonged to the National Liberation Army, one of six guerrillagroups operating in Colombia and that ``together withnarco-traffickers they had carried out terrorist acts'' in theMedellin area in recent weeks.   The traffickers have used the attacks to try to persuade thegovernment not to extradite drug lords to the United States to standtrial. Medellin, a city 150 miles northwest of Bogota that is theheadquarters for Colombia's biggest cocaine cartel, had been thefocus of the attacks.   No one claimed responsibility for the explosions in Bogota, whichdamaged all four banks were damaged, said a Bogota police spokesmanon condition of anonymity. But suspicion fell on drug traffickers inthe area.   The government announced Thursday that it had arrested twomembers of the Medellin cartel wanted in the United States and saidthey were being held in a maximum security prison pendingextradition.   It also decreed a state of emergency in the cities of PuertoBoyaca and Pacha in midwestern Colombia just east of Medellin.   The region is considered a stronghold for drug-linked deathsquads and processing labs, and the decree allows President VirgilioBarco to put army troops on alert and send military advisers to``help'' the mayors of the two cities.   Last week, Barco used special emergency powers to replace themayors of those cities with military officers, but he suspended theorder after widespread criticism that it was unconstitutional.   The government identified the men to be extradited to the UnitedStates as Bernardo Pelaez Roldan and Guillermo Bueno Delgado.   The two were paraded before reporters at the National SecurityDepartment, Colombia's version of the FBI, on Thursday. Pelaez,bearded and wearing a leather jacket, cursed at the journalists andthreatened photographers with a cane. He had a cut on his head.   A communique from the department said Pelaez, arrested Wednesdayoutside the capital of Bogota, was wanted in Detroit for``conspiracy and distribution of cocaine.'' The Justice Departmentin Washington said he was convicted of drug-trafficking charges inDetroit five years ago and faces 15 years in prison.   The Justice Department said Bueno Delgado was wanted on drugtrafficking charges in Tallahassee, Fla., and San Francisco and wasaccused of ``introducing 5,740 kilos (12,628 pounds) of cocaine andmoney laundering.''   The two are not among the so-called ``Dirty Dozen'' list preparedby the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration of the most wantedColombian drug barons.   But the Justice Department also has another list, not madepublic, of 82 lesser Colombian drug figures. It was unknown whetherPelaez and Bueno Delgado were on that list.   Gen. Miguel Maza Marques, who heads Colombia's anti-drug war andthe Security Department, described Pelaez as ``much bigger'' thanEduardo Martinez Romero, the alleged financier for the Medellincartel who was extradited to Atlanta Sept. 6.   He has been the only person extradited so far under under aspecial decree by Barco to bypass the courts and eliminate thepossibility of bribes and intimidation by drug lords.   Colombia launched the drug crackdown after the Aug. 18assassination of leading presidential candidate and anti-drugcrusader Sen. Luis Carlos Galvan on Aug. 18.   The army has said it will continue the crackdown ``to the lastsacrifice.'' But despite a $250,000 reward for top drug barons PabloEscobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the two and other cartelleaders remain at large.   On Thursday, Defense Minister Gen. Oscar Botero Restrepo held anews conference to deny rumors that American troops were helpingColombia in its drug war.   Botero said 17 U.S. ``technicians'' were training Colombians touse military equipment, including weapons, planes and helicopters,which the Bush administration sent as part of a $65 million aidpackage.   Newspapers published an open letter by former presidentsBelisario Betancourt and Misael Pastana Borrero asking Barco for``clarification'' of reports involving U.S. troops.   Barco rejected an offer by the Bush administration to send troopsto help the anti-drug effort. However, the Pentagon has said up to200 military advisers could be sent to Colombia to help in trainingand maintenance of the donated military equipment.   This has sparked fears and nationalistic fervor.   Sen. Ernesto Lucena accused the Barco administration Thursday ofletting in equipment ``more fitting for an invasion of Panama thanhelping root out a Colombian drug mafia.''</TEXT></DOC>
