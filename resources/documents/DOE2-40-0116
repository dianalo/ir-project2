<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-40-0116 </DOCNO><TEXT>Discusses design of the sampler developed by the TsLAM research unit andused in coking plants for sampling coal transported by belt conveyors.The sampler is used for periodic sampling of coal with a size to 300mm and a moisture content to 14%, transported by belt conveyors withbelt width to 1,200 mm and belt speed to 2.7 m/s. The sampling systemconsists of the KSM-2 system recording sampling intervals, the MPL-150sample separation system, a coal dryer, the DR-75 vibrating crusher anda pneumatic system for coal sample transport. The final coal sample hasa volume of 0.15 dm{sup 3} and is pneumatically transported within 1.5-2.0s. Design and specifications of the system for coal sampling and sampletransport in a coking plant are evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
