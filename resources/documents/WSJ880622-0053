Inflation also compounds the coal mines' problems of sanctions, weak world prices and high domestic rail tariffs, with the result that some can't compete in the export market any longer, he said.    South Africa's annual inflation rate was 13.3% as of April.    Mr. Steenkamp said increased consumer demand and the depreciation of the rand against major international currencies will probably exert upward pressure on product prices during the second half of this year.    Mr. Steenkamp said he disagrees with analysts who predict the price of gold will fall because of oversupply.    &quot;Fabrication demand, in particular its major component jewelry, is strong and likely to grow. The major industrialized countries will continue to achieve economic growth, albeit at a slightly slower rate. With gold at bargain prices in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, jewelry fabrication is set for continued growth,&quot; Mr. Steenkamp said.    In addition, last year's &quot;massive investor interest&quot; indicates that the prudent investor continues to seek gold despite continuing positive interest rates and recessionary expectations, he said.    &quot;This investor interest isn't confined to traditional markets. Investor interest is fast growing in other areas, particularly the Far East,&quot; Mr. Steenkamp said.    He said that the South African mining industry, as part of the fight against inflation, is seeking support of trade unions for wage restraint. So far there has been a positive and constructive reaction from the unions, which appeared to appreciate that labor costs have a bearing on future job opportunities, he said.    Wage negotiations between the Chamber and the National Union of Mineworkers, which represents the bulk of the industry's labor force, are in progress.    Discussing the three-week strike initiated by the union in August last year over a wage dispute, Mr. Steenkamp said that among the negative effects of the strike was a hardening of attitudes among some workers toward the union. &quot;If the union continues to identify itself with calls for sanctions, and if sanctions were to increase, the prospects for a softening of these attitudes can hardly improve,&quot; he said.    But he said that the current wage negotiations gave grounds for believing that &quot;good-faith bargaining will win out this year.&quot;    Mr. Steenkamp said that in 1987 total South African mineral sales were valued at 28.8 billion rand ($12.67 billion), 2.4% less than the previous year's 29.5 billion rand. The drop in export revenue was due largely to a 28.1% decline in coal exports to 2.3 billion rand last year, against 3.2 billion rand in 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
