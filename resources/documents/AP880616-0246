The venture, in which each side will hold a half interest valuedat $800 million, will maintain exclusive use of the Texacotrademark for marketing gasoline, diesel fuel and home heating oilin the 23-state region, a jointly released statement said.   It said an agreement in principle forming the venture had beensigned by officials of the White Plains, N.Y.,-based oil giant andAramco Services Co., the Houston-based subsidiary of the ArabianAmerican Oil Co., also known as Aramco.   Saudi Refining Inc., and Aramco Services Co. subsidiary, willhold half interest in Texaco's refining assets and marketing systemin 23 eastern and Gulf Coast States, as well as the District ofColumbia, the statement said.   The assets in queston will include three major Texacorefineries, located in Delaware City, Del.; Convent, La.; and PortArthur, Texas, in addition to 49 terminals, about 1,450 owned andleased service stations and a branded distributor network of morethan 10,000 stations, it said.   Saudi Refining will provide 75 percent of the venture's initialinventory, or about 30 million barrels of crude and products, andeach side will pay in half of the net working capital. A barrel isthe equivalent of 42 gallons.   ``By sharing the inventory and working capital, Texaco said itexpects to achieve approximately $2 billion in cash benefits andsavings from the formation of the joint venture based on currentoil prices,'' the statement said.   Although it has been known for some time that Texaco and SaudiArabia had been negotiating this deal, Texaco had indicated that ithad been held up by Saudi reluctance to sign, until it knew whetherfinancier Carl C. Icahn's attempt to buy Texaco would be successful.   Earlier this year, the nation's third-largest oil companyannounced that it would pursue joint ventures such as this as partof the restructuring plan bringing it out of Chapter 11bankruptcy-court protection.   The company sought that protection while it was engaged in amultibillion-dollar legal dispute with Pennzoil Co. That disputewas resolved with Texaco's agreement to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil.Texaco emerged from bankruptcy court protection in April.   In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazerwas reported by the Saudi Press Agency as describing the move as``an important step in the kingdom's continuing program ofcultivating oil industry marketing.''   The joint venture would provide the kingdom with ``a guaranteedutility for marketing Saudi crude oil and a good opportunity forthe kingdom to take part in a profitable commercial venture in acountry with a large marketing potential,'' Nazer said.   Under the agreement announced today, the venture would have theright to buy up to 600,000 barrels of crude daily from Saudi Arabiaat prevailing market prices.   The partnership said it anticipated ``no significant changes inoperations or staffing levels at the Texaco facilities involved,and no changes in the products and services provided to customers.''   The formation of the joint venture is subject to furtherapprovals by the Saudi government and Texaco's board, as well asvarious U.S. governmental regulatory bodies.   It is expected to be completed by the end of this year, thestatement said.</TEXT></DOC>
