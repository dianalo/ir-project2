The place is packed and owners Max and JuneStanley are helping out by waiting on tables.;    The beautiful, 6-foot woman,skinny as a stick figure, walks on stage and jumps right into &quot;Tough Love,&quot;standing up to dance and sing before finally sitting down to pound out thosegator licks on the big Yamaha keyboard. It's the kind of number that has madeBall one of the reigning queens of Austin, Texas' famous live-music scene. Thecrowd goes nuts.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE TIMING WAS RIGHT FOR A DYNAMITE NIGHTOF CAJUN ROCK  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Pop Music Review  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;Thank ya'll for comin' out,&quot; she tells the crowd after the last note hits.&quot;We all have a lot on our minds. . . . We'll keep entertaining ya'll as longas we can -- we'll even entertain the troops if it comes to that . . .&quot;;   Riyadh isn't on the Marcia Ball Band play date list at the moment, but a lotof her fans were thoroughly entertained at JJ's on Wednesday, thanks to herall-out, dance-crazy mix of Cajun zydeco, rock-a-billy, blues and anythingelse she likes.;    Once Ball gets rolling with her show, she doesn't let itslow down; she'll just finish &quot;Just Kiss Me, Baby,&quot; then lean back from thepiano bench and tell the fellas, &quot;Let's do 'Red Hot,' &quot; and BOOM, they're backto rockin' the joint while folks are dancing the Cajun two-step in thecorner.;    As she says at the break, dancing and having fun is the way ofzydeco musicians, especially compared to the standard blues bands that areJJ's staple. &quot;Blues bands are by nature more somber,&quot; she says. &quot;Cajun bands,if they aren't out playin', they're out dancin'.&quot; And Ball's audience (abouthalf women this night) at JJ's reflects her growing following among women intheir 20s and 30s.;    Why do these young women like Ball so much?;    &quot;I'mdoin' stuff a lot of people would like to do,&quot; Ball says. &quot;They like myindependence. I don't let a man tell me what to do -- I'm like a role model.&quot;Ball sings also about needing men, about needing love, but she says that's adistant third on her list of themes. Being free comes first, having fun comessecond.;    So, &quot;Forget About You&quot; is followed by some kind of Cajun swampboogie, which is followed by &quot;Just a Fool to Love You,&quot; a rock-a-billy pianopounder, which is followed by the Randamp;B standard &quot;You Can Have My Husband, ButDon't Mess With My Man.&quot;;    Ball's voice, ranging from soprano to contralto,has a rich timbre that wraps around her Louisiana-Texas drawl like thickhoney. On the ballad &quot;I Been There,&quot; a mixture of classic blues andtears-in-your-beer music, she was backed by a three-part harmony from herfour-piece back-up band. Rich stuff.;    After last night's show at MillValley's Sweetwater Inn, Ball plays tonight at Palm's Public Playhouse inDavis. Saturday night, Ball will be at Slim's in San Francisco, where theopening act will be Johnnie Johnson, the great rock 'n' roll pianist who firstgave Chuck Berry a job way back in the '50s.;    Ball will be back at Slim'sFeb. 16 with what she calls &quot;the girl group&quot; -- the congregation of Ball,Angela Strehli and Lou Ann Barton, with the Antone's band, from Austin's mostfamous blues club.;    The trio, wild Texas women who are key factors inmaking Austin the best party town in Texas, have just released an album,&quot;Dreams Come True,&quot; which got three and a half stars in the current RollingStone.; Marcia Ball; Where: Palms Public Playhouse, Davis, (916) 756-9901;When: Tonight; Tickets: BASS outlets; at the door; Where: Slim's, 333 EleventhSt., San Francisco; When: 9 p.m. Saturday; Tickets: $10, (415) 621-3330  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOHN ORR, Mercury News Entertainment Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910118  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  713  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday January 18, 199100018125,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
