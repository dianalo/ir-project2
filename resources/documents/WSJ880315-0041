Also, a special committee of independent CertainTeed directors endorsed the offer.    An officer of Valley Forge, Pa.-based CertainTeed said last night that Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., the company's financial adviser, believes the $387 million price is fair to minority holders.    &quot;I suspect this will be the end,&quot; the officer said. &quot;I hope it is.&quot;    But it remained unclear whether the offer will be sufficient to resolve three separate class-action suits pending in Maryland and Pennsylvania. The suits attacked Paris-based Saint-Gobain's initial offer of $334 million as &quot;wholly inadequate&quot; and accused the French maker of industrial products of breaching its fiduciary duty. Lawyers representing the minority holders who brought the suits couldn't be reached for comment.    The sweetened bid is the result of an intensive, two-week review by the CertainTeed committee, consisting of the six directors of the 13-member board who aren't affiliated with Saint-Gobain. After Saint-gobain made its initial bid late last month, a team of Goldman Sachs analysts accompanied CertainTeed officials on a tour of company factories and offices around the U.S. to estimate the company's fair market value.    CertainTeed, a maker of glass-fiber insulation, building materials and piping products, had 1987 sales of about $1.16 billion. The weak dollar and the stock market crash last October have made U.S. companies like CertainTeed more attractive to overseas suitors. Analysts view CertainTeed as a strong competitor in the insulation market. It generates an annual cash surplus of $50 million. CertainTeed's present management has quietly restructured the company by closing inefficient plants, making a successful acquisition and boosting returns on assets.    As previously reported, securities analysts who follow CertainTeed were generally critical of Saint-Gobain's initial bid. Most said they believe CertainTeed's market value is between $48 and $55 a share.    Yesterday, CertainTeed closed at $45.50 a share, down 12.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The announcement was made after the market closed. The stock has been trading well above Saint-Gobain's inital offer since it was made.    Saint-Gobain holds an estimated 11 million of CertainTeed's 19 million shares outstanding. The concern, which had 1987 sales of about $13.4 billion, holds majority stakes in a number of overseas companies.    Saint-Gobain said the revised offer would expire at 12:01 a.m. EST March 29, unless extended. Lazard Freres andamp; Co. is acting as dealer-manager in connection with the offer.    Saint-Gobain's offer isn't conditioned upon any minimum number of shares being tendered. If more than 50% of the available shares are tendered, the remaining holders would also receive $47.50 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
