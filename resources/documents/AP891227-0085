The Beijing University students, in a two-hour meeting withState Council spokesman Yuan Mu, also sought China's response toevents in Romania and hissed when Yuan stressed that China won'tveer from its socialist road.   Yuan's meeting with the students appeared timed to the overthrowof Romania's dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, which has rekindled sparksof student activism smothered by the June crackdown on thestudent-led pro-democracy movement.   At least three illegal posters have gone up at Beijing andQinghua universities in recent days commenting on Romania'suprising, according to Chinese and Western sources. One postersaid, ``Learn from Romania.''   Another, one of two at Beijing University, described Ceausescuas a ``lost dog'' who might try to flee to China, whose leaders hadregarded him as a friend. All the posters were torn down swiftly byauthorities.   It was one of the first open acts of opposition to thegovernment on the campus since it was in the forefront of thecrushed student movement.   A student who attended the meeting said about 300 students withtickets issued by official student associations were allowed toattend the meeting, and only university-approved student leaderscould read questions submitted in advance.   But one student shouted out a question asking why former partychief Zhao Ziyang was purged following the June turmoil and blamedfor China's economic and political problems when it was his mentor,senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who has decided policy in the pastdecade.   Yuan didn't answer, and also didn't respond when a student askedwhy Deng had suddenly anointed new party chief Jiang Zemin as the``core'' of China's new leaders after allowing the ouster of twotried and experienced revolutionaries, Zhao and former partyGeneral Secretary Hu Yaobang.   Hu, whose death in April set off the pro-democracy movement, wasalso dismissed from office, in January 1987, after being blamed forfailing to stop student rallies for democratic reform.   The students asked the whereabouts of Zhao, who has not beenseen in public since May, and were told he is in Beijing. They alsoasked about Wang Dan, the Beijing University student who was one ofthe leaders of the spring movement.   Beijing City party Secretary General Yuan Liben said he wasunder arrest, but provided no other details.   When asked about Romania, Yuan Mu replied: ``No matter what thesituation is in the rest of the world, China will always walk thepath of socialism, uphold the socialist flag and adhere to theleadership of the Communist Party of China.''   The student participant said Yuan spoke with vehemence, standingup and banging his hand on the table.   But when he went on to repeat familiar socialist principles,some students made hissing noises. ``The students were very braveto do that in these times,'' the student said.   Some students also yelled out questions about the legitimacy oftwo student leaders who were reading questions. In May, whenindependent student organizations were formed to challenge theofficially sanctioned student unions, students voted the two out ofoffice. The independent unions have since been declared illegal andthe sanctioned groups restored to their former place.   The student said the session ended without all the questionsbeing answered but that both sides appeared glad to terminate thelargely fruitless dialogue.   Since June, university students have been subjected to acampaign of heavy political indoctrination and have been forced towrite ``confessions'' repenting their activities during thedemonstrations.   Students say another major uprising is unlikely at presentbecause of the political repression and close surveillance, butthat anger over the bloody military attack in June when hundreds,and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators were killed has notsubsided.   In addition to the poster at Beijing University, another posterwas seen recently outside the Central Drama Academy urging studentsto remember June. At least six people were arrested Dec. 9 whenstudents from the Beijing College of Aeronautics unfurled a bannerin front of the central TV station reading: ``Motherland, why areyou so poor?''</TEXT></DOC>
