Such a measure would requiretwo-thirds approval by voters.;    Superintendent Gary Mills said the districtmay instead consider a general obligation bond to pay to upgrade facilities,in light of the survey's results, which also indicate residents might approvea bond issue. However, no decision will be made until the district's budgetadvisory committee has considered both options and reports to the board oftrustees, Mills said.;    Sunnyvale's money woes forced $2 million in budgetcuts last year including layoffs of two dozen teachers and classifiedpersonnel, elimination of music and after-school sports programs andreductions in bus service. The situation has since worsened with educationcuts at the state level, a decision by the county to charge the schooldistrict for collecting property taxes, and a state bill for more than$500,000 in desegregation funds. School officials are considering a parcel taxas one way to boost the district's coffers.;    A bond issue could raiseenough money for improvements on district schools, all of which are about 30years old.;    Depending on the advisory committee's recommendations, Millssaid trustees may consider a general obligation bond election first, then aparcel tax election. Bond money can be used only for capital improvementswhile parcel tax money could go to improvements in technology, counselingservices and library services, and music and fine arts programs.;    Millssaid a voter information campaign would be critical before either election.;   &quot;If we decide we're going in either direction . . . we're going to have tostart in the near future (telling the public) what we're going to be doing andwhy we need to do it,&quot; Mills said.;    Among the survey's findings:;   (check)82.6 percent believe quality public education is important.;   (check)57 percent said the quality of education in the district was average toexcellent.;    (check)69.7 percent said they would be more likely to vote fora school tax measure if their taxes would increase $21 per year; 58.5 percentsupported a tax increase of $50 per year; more than 50 percent opposed a taxincrease of $72 per year.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ALETA PAYNE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910220  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  430  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 20, 199100051282,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
