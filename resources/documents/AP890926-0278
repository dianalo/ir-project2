He also said he would continue to oppose an ``unacceptable''Democratic alternative for a liberalized Individual RetirementAccount deduction.   ``A president has to use the tools at his disposal to accomplishthe ends for which he was elected. And I plan to do exactly that,''Bush said.   House Democratic leaders have coupled their plan to expand IRAdeductions with a tax increase on weathly Americans and a moremodest reduction in the capital gains taxes than Bush wants.   The House is expected to vote on the issue later this week.   In a letter sent to all members of the House later Tuesday, Bushreiterated that he would veto the Democratic plan if it reaches hisdesk.   ``No matter how you dress it up, that alternative is a taxincrease _ plain and simple,'' Bush said in the letter. ``That's noalternative, and my response will be equally plain and simple _veto.''   At an Oval Office meeting with a group of business people whosesupport for the lower capital gains tax was evident, Bush said ``weought to stand up to the understandable political rhetoric on theother side, rhetoric that we heard all last year and that we're nowhearing once again.''   Bush was asked by a reporter if he would be willing to seeextensive automatic spending cuts if there is no agreement in thecapital gains battle.   ``I don't want that, but I'm not ruling it out,'' Bush said.   The administration and some congressional leaders have suggestedthe fight over the capital gains tax appears to have dimmed chancesof reaching a bipartisan spending agreement for the fiscal yearthat begins Oct. 1.   Congress' failure to enact legislation getting the federaldeficit to under a $110 billion deficit target will triggeracross-the-board cuts Oct. 16 in both domestic and defense programs.   ``If (Congress) would go forward and do what we've suggested, wecould avoid sequestration (automatic cuts),'' Bush said. ``But I'mnot ruling it out.''   Bush told the business people: ``It's a tough fight. I obviouslywould welcome all your support, which I hope I have.''   He also said opponents ``simply are wrong'' when they argue thatthe capital gains cut is a break for the rich.   The administration wants to cut the maximum tax rate on capitalgains _ profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and otherinvestments _ to 19.6 percent until 1992. The top rate would thenbe raised to 28 percent permanently and gains caused solely byinflation would be exempted from taxation. The top rate now is 33percent.   The Democrats are proposing allowing all workers not permitted afull IRA deduction to write off half a contribution up to $2,000 ayear.   House Democrats proposed financing IRAs by raising taxes on therichest 600,000 couples and individuals, saying it would be awindfall for high-income taxpayers.   Earlier Tuesday, Bush's capital gains proposal was attacked byconsumer, labor and government watchdog groups.   ``Capital gains proponents are asking Americans to ignore theunjustified financial windfall this tax break will provide toindividuals who need it the least,'' said Fred Wertheimer,president of Common Cause, a self-styled citizens lobby involved ingovernment ethics isssues.   ``Congress is once again hearing the claim that there is nothingwrong with the economy that a tax cut for people with incomes over$200,000 won't cure,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of PublicCitizen, a Ralph Nader organization.</TEXT></DOC>
