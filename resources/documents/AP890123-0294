Spainish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez warned thatthe 12-nation European Economic Community will levy the tariffs ifthere is no move to ease the conflict by mid-February.   ``We hope the new North American administration will adopt a moreintelligent attitude,'' Fernandez Ordonez said.   American officials said they were pleased with the delay by thetrading bloc, known as the Common Market.   ``We want to make every effort to first contain and then resolvethis dispute, and this decision ... is clearly a positive step inthat direction,'' the U.S. Mission to the community said in astatement.   But the statement also said officials were ``very concerned''about the ministers' decision to approve a list of products that``could eventually be the target of ... counter-retaliation.''   The dispute was touched off by the EEC's decision to impose aJan. 1 ban on U.S. meat from cattle treated with growth hormones.The United States retaliated with higher tariffs on a variety ofproducts from the trading bloc.   Representatives of the European nations earlier this month agreedon a series of counter-measures to boost duties to 100 percent onU.S. imports of unshelled walnuts and dried fruit, includingapricots, peaches, prunes, apples and pears. Each round of tariffsaffects about $100 million in trade.   The European Commission, the trading group's executive body,asked the ministers to impose the retaliatory tariffs on Feb. 1.   But Fernandez Ordonez said the ministers decided against settinga date so as ``not to diminish room for maneuvering we have with thenew administration'' of President George Bush.   The ministers said in a statement they ``will take stock of thesituation'' at their Feb. 20 meeting.   ``The counter-measures will be put into effect unless there issatisfactory process in (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)or in bilateral negotiations with the United States,'' the statementsaid.   The community will ask the 96-nation GATT at a Feb. 8 meeting todeclare the U.S. retaliatory duties in violation of theinternational body's rules.   By delaying implementation of its own retaliatory measures, theEEC will ease, at least temporarily, tensions surrounding theconflict, which stems from the Common Market's decision to ban forhealth reasons meat from animals treated with growth hormones.   U.S. officials maintain that the use of certain hormones tofatten animals, a common practice among American farmers, does notpose a health risk.</TEXT></DOC>
