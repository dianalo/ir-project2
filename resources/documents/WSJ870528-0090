Under agreements between the two companies, they will combine their vaccine research and development efforts on AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The agreements unite Merck's marketing muscle, financial resources and research capabilities and Repligen's gene-splicing technology.    Merck, based in Rahway, N.J., will have world-wide rights to the AIDS vaccine technology and any finished vaccine. In return, Repligen, in Cambridge, Mass., will receive payments from Merck, including $7.5 million in the first year, of unspecified sums in future years, financial support for further research and development, and royalties on any AIDS vaccine marketed by Merck.    A Merck spokeswoman declined to estimate total payments to Repligen, saying that the amount depends on achieving various steps in the vaccine's development. A Repligen spokesman characterized the payments as &quot;substantial.&quot;    The companies warned that development of a successful vaccine isn't certain, but investors reacted favorably to the announcement.    Merck's shares closed yesterday at $154.50, up $2, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Repligen's shares closed at $24.25, up $2.25, in national over-the-counter trading.    For Merck, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, the agreements represent its first major entry into AIDS vaccine research. About a half-dozen AIDS vaccines are known to be in development, and Bristol-Myers Co. has said it expects to seek Food and Drug Administration approval for human clinical tests of its AIDS vaccine.    Repligen's development of an AIDS vaccine already is well under way, and the company reiterated that it expects to seek FDA clearance for clinical tests on humans of its AIDS vaccine by midsummer.    The agreement bolsters Repligen's access to capital and heightens its credibility as a fledgling biotechnology concern. Equally important, the provision for future royalties positions the company to profit even if its own technology doesn't result in a successful AIDS vaccine.    The Repligen AIDS vaccine, on which Merck now will collaborate, is based on genetically engineered protein fragments of the AIDS virus surface coating. Repligen said its scientists, who developed an experimental vaccine with scientists from Centocor Inc., the National Institutes of Health and Duke University, have published results of experiments that provide &quot;strong evidence&quot; that such a vaccine neutralizes the AIDS virus in animals.    Merck and Repligen spokesmen both cautioned that the tests are at an early stage and that it isn't known whether the vaccine will be effective in humans.    Thomas H. Fraser, Repligen's executive vice president, said Repligen agreed to join Merck because it needs Merck's &quot;marketing clout&quot; and because &quot;Merck's Randamp;D in vaccine development is among the best in the world.&quot; Merck currently is marketing the world's first vaccine derived from gene-splicing technology, Recombizax HB, an anti-hepatitis B vaccine.    Dr. Fraser said testing an AIDS vaccine poses unusual hurdles for researchers, since the virus is known to produce AIDS only in humans. Repligen is conducting tests of the virus on chimpanzees, but chimpanzees exposed to the virus develop flu-like symptoms rather than the fatal AIDS. Dr. Fraser said Repligen and Merck scientists will work closely with NIH and Duke scientists led by Dani Bolognesi.    At its annual meeting in April, Merck said it had organized its first AIDS research program. The Merck spokeswoman said that program, which is focused on the development of an anti-viral chemotherapy treatment for AIDS, rather than on an AIDS vaccine, will continue and won't be directly affected by the agreements with Repligen. She said Merck has been closely following AIDS vaccine research for some time and sought the agreements with Repligen because &quot;it's a very promising approach.&quot;    In April, Repligen purchased all marketing rights it didn't already own for the AIDS vaccine from Malvern, Pa.-based Centocor, which helped Repligen develop the vaccine, for 1.2 million shares, or 17% of Repligen's stock, and $2.9 million.    For the nine months to Dec. 31, Repligen had a net loss of $3.1 million on revenue of $3.6 million. </TEXT></DOC>
