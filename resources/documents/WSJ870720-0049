The case was the second major court action this month under Britain's insider-trading laws. In early July, Geoffrey Collier, a former director in the securities unit of Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, received a one-year suspended sentence and a #25,000 fine after pleading guilty to two insider-trading charges.    In the latest case, prosecutors said Mr. Jenkins had twice traded on the basis on material, non-public information. He allegedly gleaned the information through his position as private secretary to Lord Cayzer, chairman of the diversified financial-services concern.    Prosectors alleged that Mr. Jenkins made a profit of #4,000 after trading British andamp; Commonwealth shares before a corporate reorganization announcement. He also allegedly used non-public information to buy a stake in Steel Brothers Holdings at a time when British andamp; Commonwealth was considering a purchase of an interest in the company.    In passing sentence last Friday, Sir James Miskin, recorder of London, said a prison term wasn't appropriate because Mr. Jenkins hadn't previously been in trouble. He also ordered Mr. Jenkins to pay #2,000 in court costs. </TEXT></DOC>
