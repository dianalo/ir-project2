After posting a gloomy net loss for all of 1990, the U.S.securities industry will report pretax profit of about $900million in the third quarter, analysts predict. That's on topof the $2.75 billion securities firms earned before taxes inthe first six months of 1991. And the securities industry'sthird-quarter profit would be even stronger if not for acharge planned by Salomon Inc. -- which analysts expect tototal $250 million or more -- to cover expected fines andother legal costs relating to the Treasury-auction biddingscandal that has engulfed its Salomon Brothers unit.</LP><TEXT>   The securities industry's big gains, driven principally bystrong trading and underwriting revenue, are further evidenceof Wall Street's recovery from its long recession. The lasttime securities firms recorded three straight strong quarterswas in 1986 and early 1987, before the market crash.   Yet there are already signs that Wall Street's powerfulprofit surge is slowing. The third-quarter results, thoughstrong, will be slightly below the second quarter's, analystspredict. Stock trading has sagged, and that will crimpsecurities firms' commission revenue; New York Stock Exchangetrading volume averaged 162.3 million shares daily in thethird quarter, down 11% from the first half. The recordsecond-quarter underwriting activity has also abated, atleast on the bond side. Furthermore, the Salomon scandal hascast a pall over the immediate outlook for the securitiesindustry.   &quot;There's no euphoria,&quot; said Jeffrey Schaefer, researchdirector of the Securities Industry Association, a tradegroup.   Still, Wall Street's nearly four years of cost-cuttingsince the 1987 stock market crash is finally paying off insecurities firms' financial results. &quot;By not expandingemployment, the profits are coming to the bottom line now,&quot;said Leslie C. Quick Jr., chairman of discount broker Quick andamp;Reilly Group Inc.   In the third quarter, a steep decline in interest ratestriggered big bond trading gains for Wall Street firms; theyield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond broke below 8%last month. In fact, trading gains have pushed up revenues ofthe nation's brokerage firms almost 9% this year, while costsare unchanged, said Mr. Schaefer.   A healthy crop of new stock and bond issues in the thirdquarter continued to boost underwriting revenue at many majorsecurities firms. Also, robust over-the-counter stock tradingvolume signaled that small investors, though not ebullient,have returned to the market in recent months.   The stocks of publicly traded securities firms are alreadytrading at dizzying prices; many brokerage firm stocks havesoared 50% to 80% this year, compared with the overall stockmarket's 15% gain. Though brokerage firm stocks are likely tocool off, &quot;they will still be outperformers as long as ratesare being pushed lower,&quot; said Alison Deans, analyst at SmithBarney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. She is particularly bullish forthe near-term on Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Morgan Stanley GroupInc.   In the fourth quarter, Wall Street securities firms canexpect to receive chunks of cash from small investors whowill refuse to roll over certificates of deposit because ofpaltry CD returns. But analysts don't foresee the spectacularprofits of this year's first half.   Here is a breakdown of analysts' third-quarter forecastsfor the biggest publicly traded securities firms:                                                                                                          MERRILL LYNCH: The nation's largest brokerage firm, whichhas widened its already dominant lead in stock and bondunderwriting rankings, could earn $1.10 a share, up sharplyfrom 38 cents in the period a year earlier, analysts say. Ms.Deans of Smith Barney is even more optimistic, forecastingnet income of $1.25 a share. &quot;August was tremendous,September was pretty strong as well and retail{small-investor} activity never really slowed down,&quot; Ms.Deans said.                                                                                                          MORGAN STANLEY: Strong global sales and trading activitycould boost profits to $1.15 a share from the year-earlier 91cents. James Hanbury, a brokerage analyst at WertheimSchroder andamp; Co., forecasts Morgan will earn just $1 a sharebecause of &quot;relatively soft&quot; investment-banking results.&quot;Reasonable underwriting revenue made up for some of thedecline&quot; in merger and acquisition fees, he said. &quot;But thisis an Mandamp;A house.&quot;                                                                                                          BEAR STEARNS COS.: The firm had a slow July but healthyAugust and September, analysts say. Profit could rise to 40cents or 45 cents a share from 16 cents a year earlier. BearStearns Cos. had success in trading, particularlymortgage-backed securities and other fixed-income securities.&quot;They got excellent shots in there,&quot; Mr. Hanbury said.                                                                                                          PAINEWEBBER GROUP: Continued strong trading by individualinvestors could boost profits to 80 cents a share from adismal 15 cents a year earlier. Analysts say PaineWebber haskept costs down and ridden the resurgence of individualinvestors this year.                                                                                                          SALOMON: Forecasting profits is &quot;a gamble&quot; considering thecurrent government investigation of Salomon, Smith Barney'sMs. Deans said. She figures the year-earlier profit of $1.45a share could be halved. Before the scandal broke out,Salomon enjoyed a good July and August in bond trading andoverall made $200 million to $250 million in pretax operatingprofit before fines from the Treasury-bidding scandal, Mr.Hanbury said. Oil trading and refining at its Phibro Energyunit remained relatively weak, but improved from the paltryfirst half.</TEXT></DOC>
