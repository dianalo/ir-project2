versionsof popular best-sellers such as Crosstalk Communnicator.andP;  The product comesfrom Crosstalk Communications, an Alpharetta, Ga., division of DigitalCommunications Associates Inc.andM;With increasing competition for smaller shares of what is truly a commoditiesmarket, it has got to be tough for even the biggest communications softwarevendors to stay in business.andM;Of course, I can only pity these developers up to a point, especially when Iview some of these stipped-down, $99 specials.andP;  I find myself wondering whythe geniuses who created them can't give us full-featured software in asingle package.andM;Gee whiz, I'm not so lazy that I can't read a manual or two.andP;  The all-in-oneavailability of advanced features might prove less expensive for bigsite-license users in the long run, even if the original package costs more.andM;Well it looks like the folks at Hilgraeve Inc., makers of HyperAcess 5communications software in Monroe, Mich., have read my mind.andP;  Version 1.0 ofHyperAccess 5, released earlier this year, won rave reviews from mostanalysts, and for good reasons.andP;  It is compatible with both MS-DOS and OS/2.andO;That's pretty nifty for the bulk of us who still us MS-DOS but eventually maymove over to the multitasking and background capabilities of OS/2.andM;HyperAccess 5 supports virtually every modem I've heard of, and runs a hugenumber of protocols.andP;  It comes with a proprietary protocol, HyperProtocol,which can cut into the file-transfer time of standard XModem protocols byhalf.andP;  This is because it sends data in a single stream and doesn't have towait for an acknowledgment message from the other end before it can sendanother data packet.andP;  Because it can run in background on an OS/2 system,applications on the host system don't have to be interrupted when a usercalls in for file sharing.andM;But there is better news ahead for communicators.andP;  Hilgraeve announcedVersion 2.0 of HyperAccess/5 (note the slash in the new version's name) atComdex in Las Vegas, to be shipped by January.andP;  From all indications, the newversion is a beauty.andM;First, the price is right.andP;  You get joint OS/2 and MS-DOS compatibility inone package for $199, or you can buy an MS-DOS-only version with all thefeatures for only $99.95.andM;Potential SavingsandM;Think of the potential cost benefits for most categories of users: For alarge volume of incoming calls, the central computer could run HyperAccess/5OS/2, hooked up to multiple modems.andP;  Desktop PC or remote laptop users usingthe DOS version can get all the bells and whistles, including remote controlof the host, without losing any of the features of the full program.andM;Users who want to log onto Compuserve also get a heck of a lot for less than$100.andP;  In either case, this is a far better bargain than buying astripped-down $99 program that limits you to a very modest set of featuresand functions.andM;Even better is what Version 2.0 will give you for the money.andP;  The remoteaccess function will be enhanced so that callers can run applicationsdirectly from the host.andP;  This will amount to more than just downloading filesfrom a host; it will be a true file sharing capability.andM;The new HyperAccess/5 also will support high-performance V.42 9,600-bit/secmodems.andP;  It will work with the new 16550 serial communications chip thatcomes standard with PS/2s and use the chip's buffer to allow high-speedmodems to function reliably.andM;Best of all is the extension of the already-powerful HyperAccess/5 scriptlanguage.andP;  Hilgraeve has done a better job with its scripting process thananybody else so far.andM;In the new version, called HyperPilot, if/then/else functions have been addedthat, with 150 existing scripts, will let you handle virtually any automatedcommunications function.andP;  HyperPilot offers unattended calls, custom userinterfaces and complex polling operations.andM;Improved Screen EditorandM;There are some other goodies promised by Version 2.0 you'll want to try outfor yourself.andP;  It's going to have an even better screen editor, a neatRolodex-style dialing directory and even support for ISDN devices.andM;One of the more fun features might be the &quot;discerning learning&quot; capabilitythat keeps a record of keystrokes functions required for both simple andcomplex log-ons, so that much of the programming required for automatedlog-on functions is done for you.andM;With all its power and functionality, the Hilgraeve people promised thatHyperAccess/5 can run on as little as 256K memory, which is ideal, they said,for laptops and MS-DOS machines in local area networks.andM;Well, we'll see.andP;  I haven't actually tried out Version 2.0 on my 386SX yet.andO;But, based on their past software and the information on the new version, Ibelieve Hilgraeve has come up with something pretty solid.andM;J.B.andP;
