Inc.'s inability to pay thehuge debt incurred in its 1986 leveraged buyout has forced thegiant drugstore chain into federal bankruptcy protection, andillustrated the potential risks to companies and investors involvedin such transactions.   Revco D.S. Inc., which operates 2,000 U.S. drugstores in theMidwest, Southeast and Southwest, filed for protection fromcreditors Thursday, just over a month after failing to make a $46million interest payment to holders of bonds issued to finance the$1.5 billion buyout, the largest ever to fail.   Boake A. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer, told anews conference that holders of $400 million in junk bondsaccelerated the payment schedule after Revco missed the interestpayment June 15.   Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk notes commonly issued tofund leveraged buyouts and other types of corporate takeovers.   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly withborrowed funds that are repaid with the company's cash flow or saleof its assets.   Revco's buyout foundered as increased competition and sluggishcash flow crippled the company's ability to cover its obligations.   Against a tide of new discount operations and supermarketsadding pharmacies, Revco tried to slash prices and move beyonddrugs to big-ticket items like small appliances. Lately, as thoseefforts faltered, it refocused on its core drugstore business.   Revco, which has annual sales of $2.3 billion, fills more than65 million prescriptions a year.   ``Revco's leveraged buyout didn't work out, and hundreds morehave,'' Sells said. ``Junk bonds have been the best investment onWall Street...but if you'd only invested in one junk bond you'd bepretty unhappy if it was Revco.''   D.S. Partners of New York owns controlling interest in Revco,Sells said. When the drugstore chain missed its June 15 interestpayment, bondholders established a steering committee thatcontacted the company.   Proposed talks over having Revco turn over stock to satisfy thedebt broke down before they even started, Sells said.   Revco has been ``husbanding'' cash the past few days to meet itspayroll and to pay venders who sell to the company after Thursday'sChapter 11 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Akron.   Revco's two largest venders reacted well to news of thebankruptcy filing, Sells said. He said the reorganization mightdisrupt shipments from a vender or two, but he does not expect muchchange in day-to-day operations.   The company does not play to lay off any of its 28,000 employeesbecause of Chapter 11 and has received court permission to continuepayments of salary and benefits, Sells said.   The Chapter 11 filing includes Revco; its parent company, ANACHolding Co., and most of its subsidiary operations. Insta-CarePharmacy Services is not included, the company said.   The filing allows Revco to obtain new credit and invoices forgoods and services, and requires the company to submit tobankruptcy court a reorganization plan restructuring the company'sdebt.</TEXT></DOC>
