The proposed deal, which could generate more than $1 billion in sales over 10 years, would initially involve direct supply by the Belgian company, Alcatel Bell Telephone, of 250,000 lines of its System 12 digital telephone exchanges.    In a second stage, Bell Telephone would form a joint venture with Krasnaya Zarya, a Leningrad company, to assemble the exchanges with a capacity of as many as 1.5 million lines a year.    The spokesman said the contract couldn't be concluded yet because of curbs by Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls on technology transfer to the East bloc.    Alcatel is &quot;continuing to negotiate in order to be 100% ready when Cocom agrees to the technology transfer,&quot; he said. Alcatel has been negotiating the contract for almost two years. </TEXT></DOC>
