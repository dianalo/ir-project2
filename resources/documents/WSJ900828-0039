Fleet FactorsCorp. -- delivers a new and potentially devastating blow tobanks. The ruling drastically expands &quot;lender liability&quot;under the Superfund law (the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA), and isproof positive, if any further proof was needed, thatSuperfund is a terrible law with terrible economicconsequences.   Banks, nonbank financial institutions and others withsecured interest holdings: welcome to the cuckoo world ofSuperfund liability. Under Fleet Factors -- handed down May23, 1990 by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit -- banks may now be liable, on the basis ofpast loans, for the same Superfund costs as a polluter or anyother &quot;potentially responsible party.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Fleet Factors goes well beyond the 1986 Maryland Bank andTrust decision, which held that a bank foreclosing oncontaminated property could be held liable as an &quot;owner&quot; forclean-up of Superfund sites. The implications of that caseare minuscule when compared with the burdens imposed by FleetFactors.   In Fleet Factors, the central issue to be decided waswhether and to what extent the secured creditor exemption inthe Superfund law applies to banks. The question before thecourt was: What level of activity would expose a holder of asecurity interest to liability?   The new ruling answers this question with a vengeance.Fleet Factors brings to bear the full force of Superfund'sretroactive aspects. Under the ruling, a lender may be liablefor the entire cost of a cleanup if its involvement with theborrower ever put it in a position to &quot;affect hazardous wastedisposal decisions if it so chose.&quot;   Thus, it may be liable if it lent to an owner or operatorat any time during the period of disposal. It does not matterthat the contamination took place, or the loan was made,decades before the Superfund law was enacted.   To compound the absurdity, loans of mere thousands ofdollars could conceivably generate liabilities in themillions. Worse, by virtue of Superfund's use ofjoint-and-several liability, a single bank that in 1970 helda 10% stake in a syndicated loan could -- if it is the onlybank in the group still solvent -- be made to pay 100% of theclean-up costs in 1990 dollars.   The court advises banks to factor their expanded liabilityinto product prices -- but this counsel is naive. First, itassumes a price can be put on the new exposure when, in fact,the open-ended nature of environmental claims makes adequatepricing and reserving into a guessing game. Moreover, even ifthis risk could be quantified, pricing bank servicesadequately may be impossible in today's fiercely competitivefinancial services arena.   The court clearly views its opinion as providingincentives to responsible behavior. It asserts that creditorsfacing Superfund liability will more closely monitor theirborrowers' treatment of toxic waste, and that borrowers willexercise more care since &quot;inadequate hazardous wastetreatment will have a significant adverse impact on theirloan terms.&quot;   The court's ruling will actually have the opposite result.The magnitude of Superfund liability is such that, instead oftaking on the role of monitor, lending institutions will tryto insulate themselves from exposure in this highlytroublesome area. The wording of the decision fails toprovide clear guidelines for financial institutions' futurebehavior. Lenders may be reluctant to finance clients withany involvement in environmental clean-up, recycling or wastedisposal activities for fear that such financialarrangements, in and of themselves, might establish asufficient level of control to trigger liability.   The court's decision has even wider implications. Not onlydoes it pave the way for the Environmental Protection Agencyand others to sue banks; it also subjects the ResolutionTrust Company charged with disposing the real estate assetsof hundreds of failed thrifts -- in many cases, contaminatedreal estate -- to the same fate.   It is vital to understand that the past liabilitiescreated by Superfund are vast. Estimates of clean-up costsrange as high as $750 billion. Clean-up at an average siteruns from $27 million to $50 million.   Decontamination should be our first priority -- not tryingto pick the supposedly &quot;deep pockets&quot; of innocent parties.Financial institutions play a central role in our economy. Tosaddle lenders with Superfund liability will entangle them inmore and more suits by government, by borrowers and by thirdparties -- and may compromise their ability to act ascatalysts of economic growth in the future. Reform of asystem that is patently unfair and ineffective is essential.   In other jurisdictions, cases may be decided in ways thatconflict with Fleet Factors. But for now Fleet Factors is thelaw of the land, and it will continue to be the law of theEleventh Circuit unless it is overturned by the SupremeCourt. This state of affairs dictates the need for financialinstitutions to make their case for legislative reform aspromptly and forcefully as possible.   Such reform should include a program aimed at makinghazardous waste liability equitable and predictable. This isnecessary if financial institutions are to know and insuretheir risks, and if they are to be a positive force in theuniversal goal of creating a cleaner, safer environment.   ---   Mr. Connolly is vice-president at Johnson andamp; Higgins, aninsurance brokerage based in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
