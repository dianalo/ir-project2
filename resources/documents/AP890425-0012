But the study does not imply that people who dislike their jobsare genetically doomed to unhappiness at work.   The apparent impact of genes is quite modest, suggesting ``we'renot totally hard-wired'' for job satisfaction, said industrialpsychologist Richard Arvey.   Besides, he said, just as nutrition can modify the geneticinfluence on a person's height, the job setting may affect thehypothesized genetic contribution to job satisfaction.   The study suggests that genes may be one reason that some peopleseem happy no matter what they do, while others have troublefinding a satisfying job, Arvey said.   The research is presented in this month's issue of the Journalof Applied Psychology by Arvey, a professor at the IndustrialRelations Center of the University of Minnesota's Carlson School ofManagement, and colleagues Lauren Abraham, Thomas Bouchard, Jr.,and Nancy Segal.   Arvey said the study does not prove genetic influence over jobsatisfaction, but only supports the idea. He also noted that thestudy was small, and cautioned against applying the results to thegeneral population.   Two scientists who have studied genetic influence on personalitysaid the study fits in with previous research. John Loehlin of theUniversity of Texas at Austin said other research suggests geneticinfluence on personality and temperament, and an effect on jobsatisfaction appears plausible.   Richard Rose of Indiana University in Bloomington said Finnishstudies of twins have found evidence that genes may influence aperson's job choice, satisfaction with life, and frequency ofchanging jobs for such negative reasons as dissatisfaction or beingfired.   But psychologist Leon Kamin of Northeastern University inBoston, who has analyzed nature-versus-nurture research, saidMonday he was skeptical.   The reason for studying identical twins reared apart is thatsince twins in a pair share identical genes but grow up indifferent environments, some similarities between them may reflectgenetic influence.   But Kamin said previous studies showed twins reared apart tendto grow up in similar family environments, which he said couldexplain such similarities as degree of job satisfaction.   The Minnesota study focused on 34 pairs of identical twins whohad been separated at an average age of less than 6 months. Theywere not reunited until about age 32, on average. Twenty-five pairswere women.   Each twin completed a 20-item questionnaire about satisfactionwith the ``major job'' in his or her life. Arvey said the job listwas diverse, including research chemist, coal miner, assembly lineworker, computer analyst, machinist, nurse and financial planner.Seventeen women said being a housewife was their major job.   When researchers analyzed the various levels of general jobsatisfaction reported by the 68 people, about 30 percent of thedifferences appeared to be explained by genetic influence. The restwas attributed other factors such as environment.   Comparing jobs held by each member of twin pairs, researchersfound evidence that twins tended to hold jobs with similar degreesof mental complexity, physical demands and physical coordinationrequirements.   That finding supports the idea that genes also affect what jobspeople seek, researchers said. But analysis showed it does notexplain the apparent genetic influence on job satisfaction.   Arvey said there are several possible ways genes could influencehappiness in the workplace. Affecting personality is a ``verylikely mechanism,'' he said.   Alternatively, he said, genes may influence what people payattention to in their job environment, such as supervision, or mayaffect what people want from a job.</TEXT></DOC>
