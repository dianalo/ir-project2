In addition, it has a number of more specificNorthern roles, including research and development, management of naturalresources, weather forecasting, coordination of environmental emergencyresponses, environmental monitoring, acting as a science and policy advisor,providing public information, and operating Northern facilities. Withthe increased pace of industrial activity in the North, a number of priorityissues and needs in Northern environmental management have been identifiedfor the DOE. These generally relate to such areas as resource use policy,protection of environmentally significant areas, Arctic shipping andmarine oil spills, transportation corridors and associated impacts, safeindustrial operations under adverse conditions, and transboundary impacts.The most general and overriding principle governing the DOE's Northernpolicy is that all dimensions of Northern development must incorporateconservation concepts. The basic policy goal is to ensure that DOE'sprograms and activities contribute effectively and efficiently to theprotection and enhancement of environmental quality in Canada's North,and to the achievement of environmentally sound, safe and sustainableNorthern development. Four objectives, directly linked to the priorityneeds in Northern environmental management, are outlined, along withstrategies to achieve the objectives of DOE's policies. 8 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
