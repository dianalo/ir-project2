Pete Wilson and theLegislature looked there for help closing the budget gap.;    Wilson hasproposed changes in the calculation of retirement benefits and the compositionof the board of directors of the Public Employees Retirement Fund (PERS).  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GUARDING THE GOLDEN YEARSGOVERNOR'S PROPOSALTO REMAKE PENSION BOARDSHOULD BE REJECTED  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     Although his plan was part of the budget package worked out by the governorand legislative leaders, the idea is foundering, and with good reason.;   Benefits reform could use a thorough review. Sober analysts have questionedwhether they are too generous, a cost that ultimately comes from the statebudget.;    Remaking the board is a simpler question. Wilson's proposal shouldbe rejected.;    The PERS board now has 13 members, six representing currentand retired employees and seven representing the government. Two of thegovernment representatives are the state controller and treasurer, beholdenneither to the governor nor the Legislature.;    Wilson's plan is for a boardconsisting of nine members: five appointed by the governor, four by theLegislature.;    Obviously, the governor would control this board. Anyrepresentative of employees or retirees would depend on the indulgence of thegovernor or the Legislature.;    Decisions by the board determine not onlywhere pension funds are invested, but also how much the state must contributeto assure that promised benefits can be paid. Wilson's board would have everyincentive to adopt projections that imply a need for low state contributions.;   PERS could use some reform, as evidenced by its recent campaign tointimidate corporate critics of retirement benefits. But it seems unlikelythat Wilson's board would provide better protection for taxpayers or stateemployees.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910626  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  282  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday June 26, 199100178003,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
