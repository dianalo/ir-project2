Terren Peizer, testifying with immunity, said that as Milkenlearned the news of Boesky's November 1986 plea agreement forsecurities fraud from a financial news ticker, Drexel's top junkbond financier ``lost his train of thought and concentration andstarted going, `Uh, uh.' ''   Boesky became Milken's chief accuser in a traumatic financialscandal that eventually brought both Drexel and Milken down.   Government witnesses testifying Thursday offered vivid detailsof possible insider trading, bribery and influence-peddling betweenDrexel junk-bond division employees and their customers.   But as in previous testimony during Milken's pre-sentencinghearing, no direct evidence was established linking Milken to astring of crimes alleged by the government.   The second of three transactions presented at the hearing byprosecutors involves allegations of bribery and misappropration forpersonal gain of securities in the Drexel-financed buyout of StorerCommunications Inc.   Peizer also said Milken ordered him to turn over a blue ledgerbook containing a list of trades between Drexel and David Solomonof Solomon Asset Management, who had a close relationship withMilken and has been linked by the government to wrongdoing.   The witness said he handed the book over to a Drexel executive,Lorraine Spurge, in a kitchenette at Drexel's Beverly Hills,Calif., junk bond department after turning on a water faucet incase anyone was listening.   ``Everyone was running faucets'' at Drexel after Boesky's pleadeal, Peizer said.   But like other witnesses, Peizer did not link Milken directly toa bribery scheme involving Storer stock as alleged by prosecutors.   The hearing was called by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood to gaininsight into Milken's character for sentencing. The government saysMilken engaged in lawbreaking far beyond crimes to which he haspleaded guilty and therefore deserves a long prison term.   Milken, 44, pleaded guilty in April to six felony counts relatedto illegal trading and agreed to pay $600 million in penalties. Hefaces up to 28 years imprisonment.   Prosecutors charged that Milken established a partnership knownas MacPherson Partners largely to reward customers who boughthard-to-sell Storer securities with company stock warrants soldbelow market value.   Two government witnesses testified the stock warrants wereoffered to induce big investors to buy certain preferred securitiesin Storer. But neither could link Milken to any such activity.   Benalder Bayse Jr., former manager of high-yield bond funds forFirst Investors Management Corp., offered a picture of corruptbehavior by other Drexel employees at the Beverly Hills division.   He said a Drexel salesman, Roy Johnson, sought a guarantee hewould funnel Drexel First Investors' business after steering him tothe job. He said Johnson claimed he had spoken with Milken aboutnegotiating his compensation at First Investors.   ``He told me they wanted total control over the account if theywere going to endorse me for the job,'' Bayse testified.   Bayse admitted that Johnson offered him - and he bought - apersonal interest in MacPherson after he committed about $10million in the preferred securities for First Investors.   But he said he wasn't bribed to invest in Storer for FirstInvestors and bought the preferred securities because Milkenassured him the Storer deal was sound.   Bayse said Johnson told him that ``because I was a goodcustomer'' he would receive other investment tips. He said Johnsontold him one of his accounts ``was accumulating the equity'' ofRepublic Air but that ``you didn't hear that from me.'' Republicshortly thereafter received a takeover offer from NorthwestAirlines.   Thomas Connors, who headed Drexel's preferred stock group,testified that the Storer stock warrants were offered to somecustomers to induce participation.   He said one customer, Richard Grassgreen, bought a personalinvestment in MacPherson after purchasing the warrants on behalf ofKinder-Care Inc. A lawyer for Grassgreen told Wood on Wednesday hisclient was being investigated by the government in connection withthe trading. Grassgreen resigned Thursday as chairman of EnstarGroup Inc.   In its pre-sentencing memo, prosecutors said fiveMilken-controlled partnerships bought 82 percent of the Storerwarrants and made $172 million. They charge Milken was guilty offraud in the sale of the warrants, controlling the market for thesecurities and using them as gratuities for customers.   The partnership was formed shortly after the $2.5 billion buyoutof Storer by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. Drexel provided nearly$1.5 billion in financing for the deal.</TEXT></DOC>
