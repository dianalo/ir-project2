The issue sparked more than an hour of spirited debate here at the group's midyear convention. Proponents pleaded with delegates to regard the resolution not as a legal issue but as a critical public health issue.    &quot;Cigarettes are not toothpaste,&quot; Henry Monaghan, a professor at Columbia Law School and a proponent of the resolution, said. &quot;They are intrinsically harmful. . . . The Constitution doesn't guarantee a license to the tobacco industry to advertise such a deadly and lethal product.&quot;    Opponents argued that such a ban would set a dangerous precedent in restricting free speech. Banning tobacco advertising could lead to efforts to ban advertising of products that are legal, though they may be harmful, such as liquor, they said.    Opponents also argued that the issue is best left to groups like the American Medical Association, which two years ago called for a tobacco advertising ban. </TEXT></DOC>
