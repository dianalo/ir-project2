Down River Community Federal Credit Union, Ecorse, Mich., and Wood Products Credit Union, Springfield, Ore., had sued the FDIC in 1983 and 1984, respectively. The suits charged that Penn Square misrepresented its financial well-being in attracting deposits from the two credit unions.    Under the ruling, Down River will receive $1.7 million, and Wood Products will receive $182,000. Thomas S. Dann, a Washington lawyer representing Down River, said the credit union deposited $4 million in Penn Square; it recovered the balance, he said, through dividends paid by the FDIC. Wood Products said it couldn't comment on the ruling.    In Washington, FDIC officials couldn't be reached for comment last night.    The credit unions were among six that sued the FDIC after Penn Square failed in 1983. The other credit unions settled out of court. They were Bolling Federal Credit Union, Washington, D.C.; Jax Navy Federal Credit Union, Washington, D.C.; Pinellas County Teachers Credit Union, Pinellas County, Fla.; and Southwest Corporate Federal Credit Union, Dallas. </TEXT></DOC>
