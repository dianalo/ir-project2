Irina Sarishvili, a spokeswoman for the National DemocraticParty of Georgia, said in a telephone interview from the southernSoviet republic that thousands of protesters had surroundedthemselves with buses and trolleys in the square to ward off thesoldiers and tanks.   Interior Ministry soldiers and tanks were deployed Friday aftera protest in which as many as 100,000 people took part, and astrike that closed down the official television station, schoolsand public transportation, she said.   Ms. Sarishvili said small groups of soldiers were patroling thestreets and that more troops were in nearby buses.   About 1,500 police officers had been brought in from otherregions of the Soviet Union, she said.   She said that as of midmorning Saturday thousands of moreGeorgians were on the streets of the capital city. She said therehad been no violence in Tbilisi.   The National Democratic Party of Georgia and other organizers ofthe protest are demanding independence from the Soviet Union, butthey accuse the Kremlin of stirring up unrest in the autonomousregion of Abkhazia, located within Georgia.   Georgian activists say there were clashes between Georgians andAbkhazians last weekend in the resort city of Sukhumi.   BBC's World Service radio news in London said more than 100,000people had taken part in the demonstration in Tbilisi to show theiropposition to a campaign by some groups for more autonomy in theAbkhazia region of northwestern Georgia.   The BBC dispatch said 100 ethnic Georgians had begun a hungerstrike to show their anger at the autonomy campaign.   On Thursday a Georgian activist reported scores of Georgiannationalists demanding independence for Georgia were on a hungerstrike in front of government buildings in Tbilisi.   Georgy Chanturia, chairman of the National Democratic Party ofGeorgia, said in a telephone interview that 158 Georgians began ahunger strike Tuesday and plan to continue it until April 14, theanniversary of a demonstration for ethnic rights in 1978.   The hunger strikers and thousands of others have been meetingoutside government offices in Tbilisi demanding Georgianindependence, Chanturia said.   The Tass news agency reported Thursday from Sukhumi thatAbkhazia's Communist Party chief, B.V. Adleiba, has been replacedby V.F. Khishba. Khishba was first deputy chairman of the Georgianrepublic's environment committee in Nagorno-Karabakh, Tass said.   Tensions have been running high in the Caucasus region for morethan a year, mainly in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, an ethnicallyArmenian region that was under control of neighboring Azerbaijan.   Last fall, demonstrators marched in Tbilisi with a variety ofdemands ranging from Georgian independence to the manufacture ofmore Georgian-language typewriters.</TEXT></DOC>
