One way to solve this labor shortage would be to hire senior citizens, who already have proved their experience and reliability. But many seniors won't consider taking a job because if they do, the government takes away a large part of their Social Security benefits.    Ever since Social Security's inception, retirees have been allowed to earn only a small amount of income and still get full benefits. Today, an elderly worker's benefits are reduced by $1 for every $2 he earns above a paltry $8,880. The penalty amounts to a steep 50% marginal tax rate.    The idea behind this punitive measure is that since Social Security originally was meant to replace lost earnings it shouldn't go to those still working. But the retirement-earnings limit was born in the Depression, when jobs were scarce and the government wanted the elderly to retire to make room for younger people with families. The problem in many fields now is a shortage of workers.    Many elderly workers are actually better off earning less than trying to earn more. For those who earn just barely enough to pay income taxes, the marginal tax rate is at least 75%. A married person earning $8,880 in income would actually lose $18 if he received a $1,000-a-year raise. And curiously, the nation's highest marginal tax rates are imposed on the middle-class elderly.    They'll get some relief from this next year, when the earnings penalty is reduced to 33%. The House Ways and Means Committee has also voted to increase the earnings limit for workers between ages 65 and 69 to $10,440 by 1991 -- still far too low. But what the government gives with one hand it takes with the other. By 1993 the elderly would be paying up to an extra 11.8% of their incomes just to fund the new catastrophic-health program.    Why does Congress favor limiting retirement income? Static revenue models that pretend people are stick figures who don't respond to incentives predict that lifting the limit completely would cost $4.8 billion a year in added Social Security payments.    But in the real world, raising the earnings limit would induce retirees to enter the work force and earn more money. This in turn would generate higher income and payroll-tax revenues. Some 400,000 elderly workers earn annual incomes within 10% of the earnings limit -- a sure sign that workers already are trying to earn all they can without bumping against the penalty-triggering limit.    Former Treasury economists Gary and Aldona Robbins estimate that under a higher limit, the additional Social Security benefits would be more than offset by increases in federal revenues. Raising the earnings limit by $3,000 -- as Colorado's Republican Senator Bill Armstrong proposes -- would cost $110 million in fatter benefit checks, but generate $1.5 billion in extra revenue a year.    Raising the limit even more would bring in additional revenue. At the revenue-maximizing point of $39,400 in income, the National Center for Policy Analysis estimates the government would take in $3.2 billion a year in added income. That's enough to make up most of the revenue that would be lost in killing the catastrophic surtax. Even abolishing the earnings limit completely would still net $140 million in extra revenue.    Projections like these have a flesh-and-blood basis in reality. We recently received a letter from a Mr. Cleve Campbell, a real-estate agent in Naples, Florida, who wrote to tell us of his dilemma at reaching age 65. He'd like to supplement his income, but if he earns $25,000 selling real estate, he will not only pay income taxes and 13.02% in Social Security tax on that money but lose an additional $9,000 in benefits. By his calculation he would have to pay $20,505 in taxes and lost benefits -- an 82% marginal tax rate.    Mr. Campbell notes that he and his wife also will have to pay $1,600 extra a year to finance the new catastrophic-health program. The final insult is that like 75% of all seniors, he and his wife already have catastrophic coverage through private insurance.    &quot;Where else can you work, keep 18% of your earnings and give the government 82%?&quot; Mr. Campbell asks. &quot;Sounds like a place east of the Iron Curtain.&quot;    Mr. Campbell believes Draconian tax rates and penalties destroy the initiative of many elderly Americans. &quot;And when we can't create and produce, we wither -- mentally and physically,&quot; he notes.    Energetic seniors shouldn't have to believe that their country doesn't want them to work, and that they are fools if they do. These people are one of the nation's most underutilized resources. Freeing up their creative energies would not only make retirement more meaningful for many, but add to both economic output and tax revenues. </TEXT></DOC>
