Some of the recommendations -- such as tightening rules onuse of expert testimony and curbing abusive demands duringpretrial fact-finding -- have broad appeal. But for the mostpart, the 50-point &quot;civil justice reform&quot; package laid out byVice President Dan Quayle Tuesday before the American BarAssociation portends &quot;a holy war,&quot; said Harvard Law Schoolprofessor Arthur Miller, a civil-procedure and courtsspecialist.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;On virtually every one of these subjects,&quot; said Mr.Miller, &quot;the interested parties are going to be fightingtooth and nail. Every one of these proposals will havepowerful interest groups on both sides.&quot;   Some of the most controversial proposals, such as limitingpunitive damage amounts, would require legislative actionstate by state. Yet most past efforts to limit such damagesat the statehouse level have failed, despite aggressivelobbying efforts from private industry and advocates ofso-called tort reform. Opposition from consumer groups andplaintiffs' lawyers has always been fierce, and no state haspassed legislation nearly as broad as that envisioned by Mr.Quayle's task force.   Punitive damages are awarded in addition to compensatorydamages to punish a defendant for reckless or intentionallyharmful behavior.   The administration's recommendation that the loser in somefederal-court civil suits pay the other side's attorney'sfees, as done in England, would require an act of Congress.But such legislation would likely face fierce resistance fromplaintiff lawyers' groups and other special interests,including civil rights and environmental advocates.   In theory, the rule, which would be introduced on anexperimental basis, is intended to deter the filing ofmeritless lawsuits. But critics say the practical effectwould be to inhibit the bringing of novel or untested legalchallenges and to shut off access to the courts. Any suchproposal, no matter how experimental, would face &quot;greatphilosophical inertia,&quot; said Mr. Miller. &quot;There you'recutting against 200 years of tradition of easy access to thecourts.&quot;   Twenty-one of the recommendations would require changes inthe federal rules of civil procedure or the federal rules ofevidence. Similar state rule changes would likely follow,using the federal procedures as a model. But making changesto the federal rules, particularly controversial ones, is &quot;adrawn out and cumbersome process,&quot; said Walter K. Olson, asenior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Researchand the author of the book, &quot;The Litigation Explosion.&quot;   Ultimately the Judicial Conference of the United States,the policy-making arm of the federal courts, would decidewhat changes to recommend to the U.S. Supreme Court, whichwould make the final decisions.   But any proposed changes would have to be approved byadvisory and standing committees on civil rules, made up ofjudges, law professors and select lawyers. That processalone, said Mr. Miller, a member of the advisory committee oncivil rules, has become enormously political over the pastseveral decades. What used to be a process of arcane debateand intellectual detachment has become increasingly heatedbecause of specialized legal interests.   The judicial conference is already examining two possiblerule changes recommended by Mr. Quayle's commission. Oneseeks to halt abuses during the pretrial fact-finding, ordiscovery, phase of litigation, during which parties givetestimony and exchange evidence, by requiring both sides todisclose basic information. The other possible change, aimedat &quot;junk science,&quot; seeks to limit what can be submitted asexpert testimony.   But both reforms already face opposition, said JudgeWilliam W. Schwarzer, director of the Federal JudicialCenter, the research and training center for the judicialbranch. Reform of discovery abuse in particular, whileacknowledged as a needed change, is likely to be challengedby both defense and plaintiffs' lawyers. The reason? Anychange streamlining the process &quot;would reduce lawyer income,&quot;said Judge Schwarzer.   Judges are already free to implement some of the proposalsin the administration report, such as requiring parties inlawsuits to explore alternate means of resolving theirdisputes to avoid a trial.   Despite the difficulties in implementing many of theproposals, there's no doubt many people are dissatisfied withthe current system and would support efforts to make changes.In particular, says Mr. Olson, requiring that plaintiffs whofile frivolous suits pay the defendant's legal costs islikely to have broad popular support.   But others say the impact of the proposed changes, even ifall were enacted, would be minimal. Congress and the Bushadministration could achieve more for the civil-justicesystem by working to relieve federal courts of their hugecriminal case backlogs, which are squeezing out civil cases,said Judge Schwarzer.   &quot;All this,&quot; he said, referring to the proposals, &quot;is justtinkering around the periphery.&quot;   ---   SEGREGATED SCHOOLS provision is struck down by a judge inAlabama.   The pretrial ruling by Montgomery Circuit Judge EugeneReese came in a lawsuit brought by a coalition of schooldistricts challenging the state's unequal funding of schoolsamong districts.   The plaintiffs had challenged an amendment to Alabama'sconstitution passed in 1956 to circumvent the U.S. SupremeCourt's school desegregation order. The amendment eliminatedresidents' state constitutional right to a public educationand explicitly gave parents the right to send their childrento segregated schools.   Earlier his week, Judge Reese invalidated the provision,citing the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.Helen Hershkoff, associate legal director of the AmericanCivil Liberties Union, which is part of the coalition, saidthe group will now press its contention that the right toeducation under the Alabama constitution also guarantees aright to an adequate and equal education.   In a written release, Robert A. Huffaker, attorney forGovernor Guy Hunt, the principal defendant, said that thestate is &quot;concerned that the relief which the plaintiffs seekmay result in massive tax increases and unfair reallocationof state and local tax revenue.&quot; The release also said thatthe state is considering appealing the ruling.   The suit in Alabama is part of a wave of actions in courtsin 21 states challenging school financing laws.   ---   JOCKEYS MUST SUBMIT to random drug tests in Illinois,court rules.   The Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicagoupheld the Illinois regulations that apply to jockeys andother race track workers. The ruling is consistent with a1986 decision by the federal appeals court in Philadelphia,which upheld similar state regulations in New Jersey.   On behalf of a 7-4 majority of the Chicago court, JudgeRichard Posner wrote that the invasion of privacy posed bythe urine tests is minimal. But the threat posed by drug useto participants in a race is great enough to justify theregulations, Judge Posner wrote.   The majority also accepted that the state could losebetting revenue if the public believed that jockeys andtrainers were under the influence of drugs.   A dissent written by Judge Harlington Wood Jr. said thatthe tests violate the Fourth Amendment protection againstunreasonable search and seizure. &quot;I doubt that preventing theworst horse race accident in history would justify settingaside the Constitution,&quot; Judge Wood wrote.   The Illinois American Civil Liberties Union, whichrepresents more than one thousand race track workers fightingthe drug test, said it is considering an appeal to the U.S.Supreme Court.   ---   LEGAL CONSUMER GROUP makes waves at bar associationconvention.   Members of HALT, an activist group based in Washington,D.C., that advocates affordable legal services -- notnecessarily performed by lawyers -- gathered in Atlanta,where the American Bar Association was also meeting.   About 100 delegates attended the HALT meeting, and deputydirector Kay Ostberg met very briefly with the ABA'spresident, John J. Curtin Jr., to discuss consumer concernswith the legal system. She also testified before a barcommission evaluating the disciplinary enforcement of theprofession.   Before that meeting convened, HALT members picketed theABA with signs that proclaimed &quot;ABA is organized crime,&quot; and&quot;lawyers practice law, paralegals do it right.&quot;   HALT's goal, said Ms. Ostberg, was to translate themembers' raw frustration into a rational agenda.   ---   NOTED: Henry Lesser has joined the 175-lawyer Los Angelesfirm Irell andamp; Manella as a partner in its corporate andsecurities group. Mr. Lesser, a 44-year-old mergers andacquisitions specialist, was previously a partner in the LosAngeles office of 375-lawyer Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp;Jacobson, which is based in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
