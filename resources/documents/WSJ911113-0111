The Saturday fire, and the ensuing damage to the plant'sgenerator, turbine and condenser, resulted in a shutdown ofthe plant that could last a year, according to the NuclearRegulatory Commission's worst case scenario. The plant insouthern New Jersey provides about 4% to 5% of the utility'stotal generating capacity and is one of five nuclear plantsit operates.</LP><TEXT>   While the Newark, N.J., company doesn't have a damage costestimate, a spokesman said the equipment involved would costin the tens of millions of dollars if it had to be replaced.Westinghouse Electric Corp., which designed the reactor,declined to comment.   The plant uses nuclear power to produce steam, which inturn is used to generate electricity. Although the reactorside of the plant wasn't affected, uncertainty over whetherthe utility can recover the costs through higher ratesresulted in volatile trading of the stock yesterday.   In late New York Stock Exchange trading, Public Service'sstock fell 87.5 cents to $27.75. It fell as low as $26.875during the day, with volume about ten times the dailyaverage.   The market volatility also reflected delays in getting thenews to the financial community. Public Service Electric andamp;Gas Co., the Public Service Enterprise unit that operates thefacility, said that it disseminated information on the fireSaturday and Monday. However, because of the Veteran's Dayholiday, the information wasn't widely distributed.   Yesterday, Barry M. Abramson, an analyst with PrudentialSecurities Inc., downgraded Public Service Enterprise's stockto a hold from a buy, citing the severity of the damage, thepossible lengthy shutdown and the uncertainty of what thefinancial impact would be. Mr. Abramson found the company'streatment of the announcement unusual. &quot;Most utilities knowthat anything that happens to nuclear plants has financialsignificance,&quot; he said.   The fire broke out just before noon EST Saturday at theplant's generator. The plant was automatically shut down, andthe fire was put out 15 minutes later, PSEandamp;G said, addingthat the reactor wasn't damaged and that no radiation wasreleased. After the fire was put out, extensive damage wasdiscovered in parts of the turbine. Turbine blades punchedthrough a one-inch thick steel plate shroud around theturbine. In addition, there was damage to the condenser baywhere the steam is converted into water. &quot;It was very seriousfrom an equipment damage point of view,&quot; said Karl Abraham, aspokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which hasdispatched specialists to examine the site. &quot;It would be verycostly to repair.&quot;   A PSEandamp;G spokesman said it would take a month just to takeapart the turbine and get a better handle on what hadhappened. The company has no estimate on how long the plantwould be out of service.   Mr. Abramson of Prudential Securities said that apart fromreplacement and repair costs, the company also could incurcosts of hundreds of thousands of dollars a day to buyreplacement power while the unit is shut down. Whether thecompany can recover these costs through higher rates woulddepend on the results of the investigation of the accident.If the probe finds that PSEandamp;G was negligent or mismanaged thefacility, then the company would not be able to recover thecosts and could face penalties.   The company spokesman said that currently it doesn't needto find replacement power, saying that peak usage is in thesummer months. In addition, he said the company won't take acharge in the current quarter related to the accident.&quot;Pending regulatory review, we expect to recover the cost ofrepair and replacement,&quot; he said.   Public Service Enterprise, the largest provider of powerin New Jersey, holds a 42.5% stake in the Salem 2 facility,the same size as Philadelphia Electric Co. The remainder isheld by Atlantic City Electric Co. of Pleasantville, N.J.,and Delmarva Power andamp; Light Co. of Wilmington, Del.   This isn't the first time that the unit has been shut downbecause of equipment problems. In 1983, Salem 2 and theneighboring Salem 1 unit were closed because of extensivedamage to their generators brought on by leaks in the coolingsystem. The cost of repairing the two plants totaled $100million, the company spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
