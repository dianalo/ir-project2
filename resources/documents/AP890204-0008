(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head coach of a high school footballteam was suspended for allegedly staging a photo session on schoolgrounds in which some of his players posed with a machine pistol, anassault rifle and a bayonet, school officials said.   Mike Pearson, a physical education teacher at Oxon Hill HighSchool in Prince George's County, Md. was placed on administrativeleave with pay on Monday after school officials learned thatdefensive players on the school's football team posed, weapons inhand, for the promotional poster on Jan. 27.   A student told school officials that Pearson asked him to bringthe weapons to school, officials said Friday. The weapons were notloaded when they were confiscated by school security officers andturned over to police, school officials said.   The student, who is enrolled at the school but is not a member ofthe Oxon Hill football team, was temporarily suspended Monday,school officials said.   The players said the poster was intended to be used as apublicity stunt to showcase the team's ``top guns'' and originallywas supposed to be staged at the county jail.   That didn't work out, so they staged the photo session at theschool.   ``It was a pretty innocent thing,'' one player, who asked not tobe identified, told The Washington Post. ``The idea was to make theguys look tough, that's all.''   The incident occurred one day after four students were shot atanother high school in nearby Washington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
