SimpsonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXES </IN><TEXT>   The nation's charities are becoming expert at doing good by doing well. But their for-profit competitors are crying foul.    The profit motive is stronger than ever in the nonprofit sector as institutions, some of them trying to compensate for cuts in federal spending, expand their money-making sidelines. Hospitals sell hearing aids and operate commercial laundries and pharmacies. Universities organize tours and run catering services. YMCAs start profit-making exercise centers. Some Planned Parenthood groups even market their own brand of condoms.    Most of those sidelines, however, are also tax-exempt. According to the U.S. tax code, charities are required to pay federal income taxes on profits from commercial endeavors only if such activity is unrelated to their charitable purpose. But the code doesn't define what is &quot;unrelated.&quot;    Small-business owners contend that the law is far too vague and that -- coupled with other privileges such as lower postal rates and access to public-service advertising -- it gives charity businesses an unjust edge. Meanwhile, tax officials say they are waiting for legislative guidelines on what constitutes unrelated business activities for nonprofit groups.    &quot;I don't mind competitors -- we can get down to dirt and compete with the best of them -- but they're competing unfairly,&quot; says David Applebaum, president of a Honolulu laundry. Mr. Applebaum figures that his business, which takes in about $12 million annually, has lost more than $400,000 in business a year to hospital laundries charging as much as 30% less. &quot;I just want them to live by the same rules that I live by, pay the same taxes, have the same cost of capital,&quot; he says.    Charity officials counter that their business ventures deserve a tax break. &quot;The principal motivation of nonprofits is service rather than profits,&quot; argues a position paper issued by the Independent Sector, a coalition of voluntary organizations, foundations and corporations. &quot;Nonprofit organizations are special because they serve the public interest.&quot;    Despite the surge in commercial activity, nonprofit groups still generate the largest part of their income from services they have always provided, says Lester Salamon, director of the Institute for Policy Research at Johns Hopkins University. He estimates that commercial sales account for less than 6% of all nonprofit groups' income. Still, some groups' dependence on profitable sidelines is increasing.    During the past five years, for example, the Philadelphia YMCA has spent $7 million, or about 60% of its capital-improvement budget, to upgrade its inner-city facilities. At one such building, revenues from a Nautilus center help pay for scholarships to a private school housed in the same facility. Although tuition is just $2,000 a year, half the school's 300 moderate-income students need financial aid. &quot;We have to be able to earn a modest margin to fund the charitable works we need to do,&quot; says Richard L. Betts, president of the Philadelphia YMCA.    For Gerald Ostrow, the issue cuts both ways. As president of a commercial laundry in Pittsburgh, Mr. Ostrow successfully argued that a tax-exempt laundry run by several nonprofit hospitals wasn't part of the hospitals' charitable mission. Yet as a board member of the local Jewish community center, Mr. Ostrow voted for the construction of a tax-exempt health club that will compete with a racquet club owned by a friend. While acknowledging the inconsistency, Mr. Ostrow says the health-club revenues will replace federal funds that once subsidized community services.    In Pullman, Wash., Gerald Brong, a computer store owner, says he nearly went bankrupt after Washington State University began to sell computer products. &quot;I certainly grant that they need money,&quot; says Kenton H. Pattie, a vice president for the International Communications Industries Association, a trade group for dealers of audio-visual and computer equipment. &quot;But they shouldn't get it at the expense of small business.&quot;    Arguments on both sides have aroused congressional interest. A House Ways and Means subcommittee has scheduled hearings on the issue later this year. Meanwhile, legislation that would limit the tax-exempt activities of nonprofit groups is pending in at least a dozen states.    &quot;This back-door approach of forming businesses is what's bothering me,&quot; says Ida Stabinski, research director for the Pennsylvania legislature's small-business committee. &quot;I don't believe a nonprofit in Pennsylvania can wear two hats. Either you're a nonprofit or a for-profit.&quot;    The answer may not be that simple. Charitable organizations have been stung by government cutbacks, and increased donations have only partly taken up the slack. Charities say they have no choice but to earn more of their own way.    Some charities have even set up separate profit-making subsidiaries for their most ambitious ventures. Last year, for example, Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh opened Mothers Work, a dress shop and mail-order catalog for pregnant executives. &quot;We thought it was a natural extension of the services we provide,&quot; says a hospital spokeswoman.    The increased activity is attracting the attention of the Internal Revenue Service. Last year, the agency collected just $27.5 million in unrelated business income taxes from charities. In 1982 -- the last year for which the IRS has full data -- nonprofit groups reported total revenues from all sources of about $196.3 billion. The IRS plans to audit 3,000 groups that filed unrelated business income-tax forms in 1986.    Some states are moving to restrict untaxed entrepreneurialism. In Arizona, for example, state agencies are prohibited from entering markets already served by commercial business. Other states are challenging charities to prove that they deserve an exemption. Eighteen months ago, the tax assessor for Oregon's Multnomah County placed the local YMCA on the tax rolls when he determined it spent just 11% of its budget on charitable activities.    &quot;Charities don't have to be limited to serving the poor, but there has to be some element of giving,&quot; says Michael J. Morris, an attorney for a local health-club owner. The YMCA is appealing.    Even when charities pay taxes, businessmen say it is tough to compete against them. Nonprofit groups enjoy &quot;a special place in the hearts of Americans,&quot; says Joseph O'Neill, chairman of the Business Coalition for Fair Competition, an alliance of two dozen trade groups affected by the competition issue. &quot;The halo effect is on their heads and the mantle of goodness is around their shoulders. They have the image that they're not in there for the money but for the public good.&quot;    Dr. Alan Berger, a Michigan veterinarian, discovered the perils of taking on a nonprofit group when he challenged the tax-exempt status of animal clinics run by two local humane societies. The IRS ruled against the vet, although one humane society later decided to convert its clinic into a profit-making -- and tax-paying -- subsidiary anyway. Though Dr. Berger's practice, which had dropped 40%, has recovered, he still remembers how humane-society supporters picketed his office. Some even called him an animal-hater. </TEXT></DOC>
