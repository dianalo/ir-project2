A previouslydeveloped 1/4-scale model coalface was modified and used for the experimentalwork. Initial trials were conducted on clearance ring picks which showedthat the forces experienced increased with the angle of inclination,that the interactions between lines were governed by the cutting sequenceof the shearer drum lacing, and that the sideways forces recorded wereof a similar magnitude to that of the normal forces. The pick force steeringsystem operates on the variation in cutting forces experienced acrossthe face by clearance ring picks. These variations are caused by thediffering strengths of the horizons present and the research was designedto optimise the reduction of the force patterns obtained. The use ofa leading pick was shown to greatly reduce the underlying sinusoidalnature of the cutting forces, thus increasing the resolution of the forcepatterns. Operating parameters, i.e. drum speed and advance rate, affectedthe force levels, but not the patterns.</TEXT></DOC>
