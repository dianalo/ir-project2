In simple terms, Zhao is the advocate of rapid economic reforms,a liberal whose sympathies lie with the pro-democracy students. Liis the economic conservative who prefers the status quo to riskychanges and who ordered martial law rather than give in to studentdemands.   But in Chinese politics, such categorizing can be dangerous andfactional rivalries often cross ideological lines.   All meetings of the 17-member Politburo, the Communist Party'stop decision-making body, and its core group, the five-man StandingCommittee, are conducted in secret, and it is impossible todetermine how the sides are dividing up in the current showdown.   Here, however, are a few of the main players:   Deng Xiaoping _ Deng, 84, has given up his Politburo post andnow heads only the Central Military Commission. But he remains themost powerful man in China. Deng has won international respect forachieving spectacular economic progress in China with hismarket-oriented reforms, but politically he is an oldtimerevolutionary with little tolerance for dissent.   Deng is believed to be behind Li's decision to crack down on thestudents and appears to have come out strongly against Zhao, hislongtime protege. It wouldn't be the first time Deng turned on theman in line to succeed him. Two years ago Deng forced theresignation of party chief Hu Yaobang, another relative liberal,for failing to subdue student demonstrations. It was Hu's deaththat sparked the current unrest.   Yang Shangkun _ China's head of state, or president, is anoctogenarian military man who has been put in the reformist campbecause of his close association to Deng. However, it was Yang whoannounced that troops would be brought into Beijing, and he appearsto be firmly behind Li.   Wan Li _ The head of the National People's Congress is anothersolid proponent of reform. But he has long come out second-best tofellow reformer Zhao, and won't necessarily throw his full weightbehind Zhao. Wan may be waiting to move into the void if both Zhaoand Li fall.   Hu Qili _ Hu, a member of the Standing Committee in charge ofparty propaganda, also is regarded as having reformist sentiments.But he has a reputation of drifting with the political wind andcould throw his support to either side.   Yao Yilin _ A Standing Committee member, vice premier andeconomic expert, Yao is in the conservative camp.   Qiao Shi _ If the Standing Committee splits between the twoprogressives Zhao and Hu and the two conservatives Li and Yao, Qiaocould be the swing vote. Qiao, who has a history of work insecurity matters, has rarely made his political views known.   Another uncertainty is how much influence senior leaders outsidethe Politburo will have in deciding China's political future.   Although many aging ideological hardliners have relinquishedtheir official posts, some continue to have considerable powerbecause of the personal loyalties they command. Among them are ChenYun and Bo Yibo, chairman and vice chairman of the Central AdvisoryCommission, a halfway station for elderly leaders on their way toretirement.   If they demand a voice in resolving the political fight, Zhaocould be in trouble.</TEXT></DOC>
