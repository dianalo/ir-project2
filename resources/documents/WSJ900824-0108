Justto the north and east of the Persian Gulf, Indian andPakistani forces are sniping at each other across the borderof Kashmir. The two countries have fought three wars since1947: It looks disturbingly as if they are preparing for afourth.   Last week, Pakistan accused India of attacking a militarystronghold on its side of the mountains; this week, Indiaannounced that Pakistani artillery had bombarded Indianinstallations. For the moment, India and Pakistan arequarreling over who shoved whom first. But the real issue iscontrol of the Indian province of Jammu andamp; Kashmir -- theissue that sparked the second Indo-Pak War in 1965.</LP><TEXT>   The largely Moslem people of Indian Kashmir are rebellingviolently against the authorities in New Delhi. They complainthat they were taken into India against their will in 1947and that New Delhi has systematically rigged elections in theprovince to keep nationalists out of power. The Indianmilitary is suppressing the rebellion in its usually bloodyand incompetent way. Hundreds have been killed. Pakistan,which occupies a chunk of Kashmir itself, is, if not armingthe rebels, at least turning a blind eye to arms smuggling.   It's exactly the same pattern as in the rich Indianprovince of Punjab. There too New Delhi goaded a religiousminority, this time the Sikhs, into political extremism. TheSikh extremists committed horrible atrocities. The Indiangovernment reacted even more atrociously. An ensuinganti-Sikh pogrom in New Delhi claimed 3,000 lives. All thewhile, guns poured in over the Pakistani border.   The U.S. has usually watched Indo-Pak relations withdismay. To its credit, India conducts itself as a huge, ifturbulent and imperfect, democracy. Pakistan has been a goodfriend of the U.S. and a bulwark against the Soviet thrustinto Afghanistan.   Pakistan's popularly elected Bhutto government has nowbeen removed under a torrent of corruption and mismanagementcharges. For all her faults, Ms. Bhutto was genuinelyuninterested in war with India. It's not clear that hersuccessors will feel the same way -- especially not after afew more months of watching Indian troops maltreat theirco-religionists. Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh, meanwhile,knows that if he lets Kashmir go, his whole country -- aseething mass of ethnic, religious, regional, clan and castehatreds -- could unravel.   All of this would be a dreadful but largely local story ifIndia had not started an arms race on the subcontinent. Itexploded a nuclear bomb in 1974; Pakistan has beenfrantically trying to catch up for 15 years. India has builta blue ocean navy, including two aircraft carriers and aSoviet-built nuclear submarine, that is making countries asfar away as Australia nervous.   If India and Pakistan want to run wasteful, socialisteconomies, that's their business. If they can't preservepeace among their component minority groups, that's alsotheir business. But if they begin to threaten not only eachother but the rest of their region with conventionalfirepower or, ultimately, nuclear intimidation, then theywill attract the world's interest. Like Iraq, they serve as areminder that the world is still an unsettled place, wherebellicose nations threaten to hurl their increasingly largeand powerful armies at one another's throats.</TEXT></DOC>
