U.S. negotiators also are on the horns of a dilemma. Ifthey force Mexico to open its borders wider to overflowingU.S. corn silos, that could set off a new flood of Mexicanfarm laborers into the U.S., the very problem that thefree-trade pact is meant to help resolve.</LP><TEXT>   Corn is grown by some 2.3 million Mexican farmers andconsumed in tortillas and other foods by almost all of thecountry's 82 million people. For decades, the Mexicangovernment has paid corn farmers huge subsidies for theirsurplus crop as a way to redistribute income to itsimpoverished rural populace. Typically, a Mexican farmerreceives about $200 for a metric ton of corn, about doubleworld prices as measured by Chicago Board of Trade futurescontracts.   &quot;They get a huge profit, more than those investing in theMexican stock exchange,&quot; says Mexico's AgricultureUndersecretary Luis Telles.   For decades, the Mexican government also has protected itsdomestic growers by regulating the flow of imported cornthrough import licenses required of U.S. corn and other grainfarmers. This past fiscal year, some 1.8 billion metric tons(about 1.62 billion tons) of U.S. corn were sent south. Undera free-trade pact that amount could easily double.   U.S. negotiators and lobbyists are pushing for furtherliberalization in the corn sector as they move toward afree-trade pact that would create the world's largest tradingbloc. &quot;Everyone recognizes that corn is a sensitive issue forMexico,&quot; says a U.S. official well-versed in thenegotiations. &quot;{But} corn has to be on the {negotiating}table. There are no exceptions.&quot;   The case of corn illustrates the complexities of trying todeal with migration and free-market trade policy. In theory,the free-trade pact is thought to be the most effective wayto stem emigration to &quot;El Norte.&quot; Mexico's President CarlosSalinas de Gortari has repeatedly hammered on anexport-products, not-people theme when selling the pact.   But many researchers note that, in the short run,migration could actually increase as Mexico restructures itseconomy. New jobs won't materialize quickly enough to soak updisplaced farm labor, note the economists. Moreover, it isunlikely that the siren call of an 8-to-1 U.S.-Mexico wagegap will lessen much in the next decade.   A confidential document from the Mexican AgricultureMinistry details plans to reduce the total acreage devoted tocorn to a third of its current level by 1996 by restrictingthe amount of high subsidies it pays to farmers. Reducingcorn acreage would further accelerate the proposed farmreforms and, possibly, induce more farmers to growmore-profitable fruits and vegetables, a scenario thegovernment favors.   While Agricultural Ministry officials avoid specifics onsubsidies, Dr. Gustavo Gordilla, the undersecretary chargedwith selling the reforms to farmers, says &quot;there is going tobe more diversification of our agriculture sector.&quot; Thatwould follow the proposed reforms, announced last month byMexico's President Salinas, to semi-privatize Mexico'sinefficient communal farm system. The bold move is designedto make farms more productive by bringing in badly neededinvestment. Last week, the reforms were passed by the MexicanCongress and now face final approval in state legislatures.   But what happens in the restructuring interim has manyresearchers worried about migration. Fully one-third ofMexico's population lives in rural areas. &quot;The issue here ishow are you going to do rural development,&quot; says Dr. RaulHinojosa Ojeda of the University of California, Los Angeles,who favors a &quot;development bank&quot; similar to that started forEastern Europe by the European Community. &quot;For the firsttime, free trade has allowed us to come to grips with thefact that rural poverty in Mexico is an integral part of theNorth American region, as though it were an integral partwithin our U.S. border.&quot;   In research funded by the U.S. Agriculture Dept. and theMexican Foreign Relations Ministry, Dr. Hinojosa and threecolleagues estimate that about 850,000 household heads willleave the Mexican countryside if corn subsidies fall andtrade is further liberalized. Of them, more than 600,000 willhead to the U.S., say the researchers, who developed acomputer model to simulate the impact of a freetradeagreement.   The U.S. currently absorbs about 100,000 immigrants fromMexico a year. One U.S. official familiar with the researchand the free-trade talks cautions that the migration wouldn'toccur in one fell swoop, but probably in more-manageable 10%annual increments.   Given century-old migration patterns, more than half ofthe migrants should head for one state, ailing California,where Gov. Pete Wilson is warning that California's welfareand social services burden is straining from foreignnewcomers. U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions in San Diego wereup 12% in the last fiscal year, which ended in September. Theresponse from that border city this summer was decidelytesty. Military-issue steel sheets, ordinarily used fortemporary airfields, replaced tattered wire as fencing.   Though the 1992 completion of a freetrade pact now seemsstymied by the flagging U.S. economy, Mexican officials saythey will continue to modernize the country. And that willinclude corn, once the centerpiece of pre-Hispanic ritualssurrounding life itself. &quot;The system has to be restructured,&quot;says lobbyist Keith Herd of the U.S. National Corn GrowersAssociation. &quot;They are restructuring the agriculture systemaround the world.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          ABOUT 1.8 MILLION metric tons of U.S. corn (1.98 milliontons) were exported to Mexico in the past fiscal year. InFriday's editions, the metric ton figure was incorrectlystated, as was the conversion to tons.   (WSJ Dec. 30, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
