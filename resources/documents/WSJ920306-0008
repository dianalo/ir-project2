During the last 40 years or so, school desegregation suitswere filed almost exclusively in federal courts, mostly toavoid hostile state judges. All of the history-making schooldesegregation rulings were made in federal court cases.</LP><TEXT>   But the plaintiffs in a pending Hartford, Conn., case,black and Hispanic schoolchildren, have chosen to file instate court. And a state court judge ruled last week thatthey have a legitimate case under the Connecticutconstitution.   By filing in state court and citing state law, theplaintiffs can make arguments that were rejected by the U.S.Supreme Court in the 1970s and are not likely to bere-examined by today's conservative court. The case issignificant because whatever its outcome, it is expected tospur civil rights lawyers to rethink their traditionalapproach to litigation.   The Hartford plaintiffs allege that Connecticut's board ofeducation is violating state constitutional law bymaintaining a predominately minority and mostly poor schooldistrict in Hartford, the state's capital, whilepredominately white, affluent school districts flourishnearby. It's a pattern repeated in many large metropolitanareas.   Under the U.S. Supreme Court's 1974 ruling in Milliken vs.Bradley, there's not much a federal court, interpreting U.S.constitutional law, can do to remedy that kind of racialimbalance. The high court ruled that courts can prescriberemedies across autonomous school district lines only when itis proved that &quot;that racially discriminatory acts of thestate or local school districts, or of a single schooldistrict have been a substantial cause of inter-districtsegregation.&quot;   In the Hartford case, however, &quot;the Milliken case doesn'tapply&quot; argues Wesley Horton, a Hartford attorney for theplaintiffs, because the state constitution's equal educationopportunity and due process provisions obligate thegovernment to guarantee that urban minorities receive thesame education as suburban whites.   He adds that the case borrows from suits that havesuccessfully argued in 11 states, including Connecticut, thatpoor school districts must receive a minimum level of statefunding or that all districts receive the same level of stateresources under state laws.   Connecticut Assistant Attorney General John R. Whelan, whohad asked that the case be dismissed before trial, calls theplaintiff's arguments &quot;novel.&quot; He said that it is theLegislature's, not the court's, responsibility to insure thatthe fundamental right to an education is protected.   Marianne Engelman Lado, of the NAACP Defense Fund, whichis working with Mr. Horton, says the plaintiffs have notasked for court-ordered busing across county lines as thesole solution. &quot;Remedies,&quot; she said, &quot;are still up in theair. It's up to the state to address the inequities.&quot;   The case is expected to be watched closely by many civilrights lawyers who in recent years have found theirlitigation efforts stymied by the many conservative judges onthe federal bench, said Derrick Bell, a Harvard Law Schoolprofessor and author of a leading casebook on civil rightslaw.   &quot;State court judges certainly can't be anymoreconservative than federal judges,&quot; Mr. Bell said. &quot;I wouldthink that we will see a lot more of these cases in statecourts.&quot;   (Sheff et al. vs. O'Neill et al., Superior Court-Hartford,No. 360977)   ---   LINCOLN SAVINGS andamp; LOAN trial to start Monday withoutCharles H. Keating Jr.   Lawyers for bondholders of Mr. Keating's former AmericanContinental Corp., which owned the thrift, said they willproceed with jury selection in their fraud case despite theexpected absence of the suit's most well-known defendant. Mr.Keating is expected to appear as a witness in the case, thelawyers said.   Leonard B. Simon, of the San Diego office of Milberg WeissBershad Specthrie andamp; Lerach, one of the bondholders' leadattorneys, said his clients don't intend to ask for a rulingthat Mr. Keating defaulted in the case. &quot;We'd rather have thejury see the whole picture&quot; and then make a finding ofliability, he said.   Last week Mr. Keating's lawyer, Stephen C. Neal, said theconvicted former Sandamp;L operator wouldn't be able to defendhimself because American Continental's insurer stopped payingMr. Keating's legal bills. Mr. Neal couldn't be reachedyesterday to comment. Representatives for other defendants,including the Cleveland law firm Jones, Day, Reavis andamp; Pogue,and the accounting firm Ernst andamp; Young, are expected to appearin federal court in Tucson, Ariz. Jones Day and Ernst andamp;Young's predecessor firm, Arthur Young andamp; Co., didLincoln-related work before the thrift's collapse in 1989.   All defendants have denied wrongdoing in the case, whichcharges that Mr. Keating as well as lawyers, accountants, andsmall brokerage houses retained by the thrift defraudedAmerican Continental investors.   Mr. Keating was found guilty last year on Californiasecurities-fraud charges that he misrepresented AmericanContinental's financial condition to purchasers of thecompany's junk bonds, including elderly customers of Lincoln.He is scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday by Los AngelesSuperior Court Judge Lance A. Ito.   The 68-year-old businessman also faces broader federalcriminal charges of bank fraud, including allegations that heset up phony land deals designed to show false profits atLincoln. That trial is set to begin this summer in LosAngeles.</TEXT></DOC>
