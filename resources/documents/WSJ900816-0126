The panel, set up under provisions of the U.S.-Canadafree-trade agreement, ruled that the U.S. steel industry wasbeing injured by imports of subsidized and dumped steel railsproduced by Algoma Steel Corp., a unit of Dofasco Inc.,Burlington, Ontario, and Sydney Steel Corp., a Nova Scotiagovernment agency.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. Commerce Department ruled last year that some ofthe steel rail imports from Canada were dumped, or sold inthe U.S. at prices below the cost of production or the pricesin the home market. The department also found that they werebeing subsidized by the Canadian government.   The department said Algoma and other Canadian producershad sold steel rails to U.S. railroads, subway systems andother buyers at prices averaging 38.79% below the &quot;fairvalue&quot; price. Another U.S.-Canada panel will review that38.79% dumping margin in a ruling expected Aug. 30.   James Melville, a vice president of Algoma Steel, said theextra duties will be a &quot;significant nuisance&quot; to Algoma butthat they weren't a &quot;fatal blow&quot; to Algoma's steel railproduction. Mr. Melville estimated that Algoma's steel railexports to the U.S. total an average $10 million Canadiandollars (US$8.7 million) a year, which, he said, made up verylittle of Algoma's overall sales.   The panel decision also upheld an order last year by theU.S. International Trade Commission that extra duties beplaced on imported steel rails from Sydney Steel to offsetthe Canadian government subsidies.   The Commerce Department ruled that Algoma should beexcluded from countervailing duties placed on subsidized railimports because its estimated subsidies amounted to onlyabout 0.24% of the price of its rail exports.   The U.S. government investigation originated fromcomplaints filed by Bethlehem, Pa.-based Bethlehem SteelCorp. on behalf of the U.S. industry.</TEXT></DOC>
