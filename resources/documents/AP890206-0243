Last week the number of rigs rose by eight to total 797 whileplummeting by 51 the week before. The previous three weeks the countdeclined twice by 32 and once by 36, all following a two-weekincrease of 25 rigs.   A year ago, the number of rigs totaled 986, Baker Hughes saidMonday.   The decline follows normal seasonal patterns, according to BakerHughes economist Ike Kerridge. The count usually drops off duringlate December through late March or early April, he said.   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activityand it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as oflast Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company thatmerged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kepttrack of the number of working rigs since 1940.   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig countreached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in therig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes begancompiling figures.   The lowest level last year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.   Among major oil producing states, California and Oklahoma saw adecline at four, followed by Ohio, two; and Michigan, New Mexico,North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Texas, one each.   Colorado, Kansas and Louisiana had gains of two each whileWyoming had one.</TEXT></DOC>
