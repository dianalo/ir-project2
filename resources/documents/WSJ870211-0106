The English-language newspaper quoted Light Industry Minister Yang Bo as telling a national conference that giving entrepreneurs full power is the key to revitalizing state-owned industries. Despite an 11.5% increase in output last year, Mr. Yang said, China's light industry is still plagued by only a sluggish improvement in the variety and quality of its goods. He said poor economic performance resulted from poor management.    Major reforms this year will include the further leasing of small companies and low-profit medium-size companies to individuals, Mr. Yang said. A number of small and medium-sized enterprises also will be turned over to collective management, which will be responsible for profits and losses, he said.    Collectively owned enterprises will be organized into joint stock companies to counter a lack of initiative arising from the system in which all workers receive the same compensation regardless of performance, Mr. Yang said. He said the joint stock system, in which workers will have shares in their company, will go into effect on a trial basis in enterprises that produce paper, salt, foods, cosmetics, chemicals, leather and household electrical appliances. </TEXT></DOC>
