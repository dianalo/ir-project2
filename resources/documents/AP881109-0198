It said the village of Zhanmapo, believed theworst hit with 297 dead, was accessible only by a footpath, and thatthis had been blocked by a landslide.   ``The victims can only be helped by air or on foot,'' the radiosaid. ``Four planes are air-dropping food, clothing and othernecessities to the hardest hit areas.''   The quake that struck southwestern Yunnan province Sunday nightwas China's worst since a 1976 earthquake that killed 242,000people. The Yunnan quake measured 7.6 on the Richter scale,signifying a powerful quake capable of heavy damage, and byWednesday morning had been followed by 184 aftershocks.   Beijing Radio said seismologists had met the day before the quakeand decided to issue a warning of a coming tremor, but they did notexpect it to hit so soon or so strongly. It was not immediatelyclear if they had issued any warning.   The Ministry of Civil Affairs told U.N. relief agencies that morethan 100,000 people were homeless, and the official China NewsService said 1,986 were injured, most of them seriously. Theministry did not change its count from Tuesday of 938 dead.   The quake affected 14 counties with a total population of morethan 1 million people, scattered over 16,000 square miles along theborder with Burma.   Trevor Page, the U.N. World Food Program's Beijingrepresentative, quoted the Ministry of Civil Affairs as sayingrelief workers still have not been able to reach many villages. Mostof the casualties counted so far have been in just one county,Lancang.   The ministry also said it would welcome donations of food,medical supplies and plastic sheeting for temporary shelters, Pagesaid.   He said the Chinese specified they were not appealing for helpbut ``would welcome any appropriate assistance by friendly countriesor international organizations.''   The ruling Communist Party and the State Council, China'scabinet, issued a statement expressing sympathy for quake victimsand urging them to rebuild their homes and restore production soonin a spirit of self-reliance.   Lancang is home to the Lahu minority, one of several farmingethnic minorities that live in the border region.   China is one of the most earthquake prone countries in the world.Its last major quake was in August 1985, when 71 people were killedand 125 injured by a temblor in far western Xinjiang UygurAutonomous Region. That quake registered 7.4 on the Richter scale.   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake,as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quakemeasuring 7.0 can cause heavy, widespread damage in a populated area.</TEXT></DOC>
