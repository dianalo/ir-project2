Swelling was low (andless;0.2%) in both SA andCW materials irradiated to 30 dpa. In SA 316, cavity size increased butthe number density decreased with increasing irradiation temperatureabove 500/sup 0/C. At 500/sup 0/C, there was a mixture of bubbles andvoids, but at 600/sup 0/C, most of the cavities were voids. Maximum swelling({approx_equal} 5%) occurred at 500/sup 0/C. By contrast, cavities in20% CW specimens were much smaller, with diameters of 6 and 9 nm at 500and 600/sup 0/C, respectively, suggesting that they were primarily bubbles.The cavity number density in CW 316 at both 500 and 600/sup 0/C ({approx_equal}1x10/sup 22/ m/sup -3/) was about one order of magnitude less than at400/sup 0/C. Swelling increased slightly as irradiation temperature increased,peaking at 600/sup 0/C (0.3%). These results indicate that SA 316 swellsmore than CW 316 at 500 and 600/sup 0/C, but both SA and CW 316 are resistantto void swelling in HFIR at 400/sup 0/C and below to 30 dpa.</TEXT></DOC>
