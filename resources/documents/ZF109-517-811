 Computer-aideddispatching.andP;  (To distinguish it from computer-aided design, let's call itCaD here.)andM;In the computer graphics world it may appear as a small niche in the muchbigger mapping market, but to public safety officials it's the only CaD worthtalking about.andP;  Through this CaD, fire and police departments are able toshave seconds or even minutes off response times, automate incidentreporting, and disperse fleets of emergency vehicles much more efficiently.andM;What's more, even as a niche market, CaD is under the influence of somepowerful technology and market trends  - trends that will increase thegraphical content of most CaD systems over the next decade:andM;Proven technologyandM;*  The benefits of CaD over manual methods are well documented.andP;  CaD is nolonger viewed as new or risky technology.andP;  Some cities are placing major betson it, in fact.andM;Several years ago the Los Angeles Fire Department commenced a $25 millioneffort to consolidate three dispatching regions into one centralcomputer-aided control center  - which links 700 vehicles, 133 stations, and2000 employees using computers, CaD, mobile data terminals, emergency powerand security systems, and mobile communications.andM;Lower costs, broader marketandM;*  The costs of CaD systems are dropping  - as they are for all computersystems  - bringing them within reach of smaller communities.andP;  Within theU.S.andP;  only about 280 cities have populations over 100,000; in all, there aremore than 40,000 cities, counties, and townships.andM;Any price trend that opens up that larger market of smaller cities bodes wellfor CaD.andP;  Today, even cities with 15,000 inhabitants and a handful of firetrucks are installing CaD.andP;  In general, a sophisticated graphics-based CaDsystem costs in the vicinity of $4$5 per capita.andP;  That's bound to drop at 15%a year.andM;Foundation is in placeandM;*  Automation itself is no longer a barrier.andP;  Other municipal areas like thecourts and finances have showed how to implement databases, train operators,and work with graphics files and digital maps.andP;  When Lee County, Florida,announced it would be installing an Intergraph CaD system, officials talkedabout the future requirement to integrate its CaD system with GIS systemsalready installed.andP;  It also helps that many communities have alreadyestablished a geobase  - digitized maps; conversion to graphical CaD is lesscostly.andM;Support technology is up to parandM;*  Communications technology has improved enough to support CaD.andP;  One of thekey components of modem dispatching is direct voice and data contact with thevehicles.andP;  Satellites and terrestrial-based navigation systems now make itpossible to provide vehicle positioning on a real-time basis.andM;In addition, navigational systems adopted for commercial applications  -general fleet tracking, for instance  - will actually spur the use of mappingapplications at the dispatching center.andM;Laptop, handheldandM;* Portable computing technology has improved to the point that many emergencyvehicles sport laptop or handheld computers and terminals.andP;  The recentdemonstration of a wireless data network by IBM (prototype handheld computersand modems) and Motorola  RF equipment) presage expansion of the CaD conceptto commercial applications.andM;Getting realandM;* The ability of CaD systems to deal with map or graphic informationinteractively in real-time has brought CaD from an abstract alpha-numericconstruct closer to the real world.andP;  The use of automatic locationidentification (ALI) for 911 systems and fire alarm systems is increasingsignificantly.andP;  Using graphical information dispatchers can cover more areaat one time, keep track of more incidents, and dispatch faster.andM;The addition of interactive graphics and user interfaces is still new to theCaD market, but it's clearly the way of the future.andM;This latter fact may best be embodied in Intergraph, which didn't enter theCaD market until last year.andP;  When the world's leader in computer-aidedmapping systems enters the market it's a sign that (1) the market has gottenbig enough to be of interest, and (2) the technology can meet the market'srequirements.andM;Joining database  and mappingandM;Intergraph's system, called CADMAP, marries the database technology inherentwith CaD systems with interactive mapping.andP;  As an added sign of modem times,CADMAP comes with graphical user interfaces  - icons to represent vehicles,windows to display data base data, and all the rest.andM;There are other large players in the CaD market, too.andP;  A U S West subsidiary,Command Data Systems, offers software and services to the market.andP;  WarnerEmhan's Planning Research Corporation subsidiary is a major installer andintegrator of CaD systems; McDonnell Douglas and GTE are also vendors.andM;The market still has plenty of room to grow.andP;  Computer industry marketresearchers haven't deemed it big enough to track in a separate category.andO;Vendors estimate its worldwide 1990 total at less than $250 million -including base computers, peripherals, and software.andM;Market bigger than appearsandM;But add in navigational systems, communications, and on-board computers andthe market easily doubles.andP;  Including systems integration, consulting, andthe occasional facilities management contract, it gets even bigger.andM;Here's another way to tote the market up.andM;According to government statistics, the typical city spends 14% of its budgeton fire and police protection.andP;  In the United States in 1989, that came to$23 billion.andP;  Clearly most of that spending is in labor, facilities,vehicles, and maintenance  - but if even 1 % is devoted to dispatching,that's a market of $230 million a year.andM;Add in the rest of the likely government candidates for CaD  - such ascounties, townships, and special districts, and private ambulance oremergency services, and you have a U.S.andP;  spending number of $35 billion onpublic safety.andP;  Take the same 1% and you have a $350 million as an order ofmagnitude for the U.S.andP;  market.andM;Decent growth anticipatedandM;With governments under siege financially these days, one wouldn't expect themarket to grow too fast, but TFS research finds a realistic growth rate of15% for the next several years.andM;While government spending on public safety tends to sit somewhere between therates for population growth and the inflation, TTS believes the growth ratefor CaD will surpass that for inflation for a number of reasons:andM;(1) spending on CaD allows municipalities to maintain service levels forpublic safety and to shift spending from labor to equipment;andM;(2) most municipalities, now automated administratively, are inclined toautomate service delivery;andM;(3) CaD may be brought in along with facilities and communications systemsupgrades; andandM;(4) CaD eliminates much of the administrative burden of manual systems.andM;Commercial market has best growth potentialandM;And that's just the public safety market  - fire, police, and ambulance.andO;Truly fast growth will be in commercial applications, primarily because thebase is so small.andP;  But some is going on already  - often in conjunction withpublic safety systems.andM;According to a bulletin published by the 7800-member Associated Public-SafetyCommunications Officers, Inc., in at least one case where an enhanced 911system was being installed (Smith County, Texas) financial assistance camefrom both the local utilities and the U.S.andP;  Post Office.andM;It turned out that the same mapping system used to provide automated locationidentification could be used to verify current addresses  - and save thosedispatching service technicians or route carriers man-hours delivering to thewrong address.andM;Applications a CaD naturalandM;Most likely the mapping piece of these commercial applications will follow onthe coattails of the sale of navigation and tracking systems for applicationssuch as:andM;*  Snow removal fleet management,andM;*  Cattle-herd monitoring and tracking,andM;*  Service fleet dispatching,andM;*  Taxi cab dispatching,andM;*  Mass transit management,andM;*  Civil defense mobilization.andM;There's a final area of growth  - and that's the gray area between static-mapGIS systems and interactive-map CaD systems.andP;  The Pennsylvania EmergencyManagement Agency uses a collection of desktop computers running GIS softwareto display all types of regional and local maps to deal with natural andman-made environmental disasters  - such as floods, tank car explosions,hurricanes, and the like.andP;  While the maps may not be used in actualdispatching, they are used to make on-the-fly management decisions --likewhere to get 50 tons of sand to spread on a toxic spill on a highway andwhere to commandeer the equipment to spread it.andM;SlowdownsandM;So, if the final market trend is a merging of CaD with GIS, understand thatit won't happen overnight.andP;  There's still a lot of alpha-numeric-based CaDout there, and in some cases that's adequate.andP;  And whenever mapping isinvolved, there's a cost of converting paper and film maps to digital format.andO;Finally, there's the fixed size of the primary market  - cities, towns,states, and federal agencies  - and the missionary work left to be done toget commercial applications up and running.andM;But watch.andP;  The CaD market is ready for a major upgrade to graphics; thegaphics, by making CaD more accessible, will help sell CaD to more first-timebuyers and thus, in its way, help redefine and broaden the market.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
