Reagan has until Friday to act and the president ``has not madea final decision,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.``We'll have to wait and see.''   The bill authorizes $299.5 billion in defense spending for thefiscal year starting Oct. 1, which is the amount Reagan asked. Butit sharply reduced spending for the Star Wars anti-missile programand includes some Democratic-backed arms control restrictionsReagan opposes.   Bush, the certain Republican presidential nominee, said in aspeech in Chicago he hopes Reagan rejects the bill. He said it is``a bad bill and I'm convinced that the president ought to vetoit.''   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., met with Reaganearlier Tuesday and said the president was undecided. But Dole'sadvice was clear: ``In my view, he should veto it.''   Later, Dole called the bill ``a Dukakis package that ought to bevetoed.'' He said at a news conference that the bill contains anumber of defense positions advocated by Democratic presidentialnominee Michael Dukakis.   But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed ServicesCommittee, said a presidential veto ``would be a serious mistake''and that the bill ``will definitely strengthen our nationalsecurity.''   ``Politics should not guide nor be the basis for nationalsecurity decisions,'' said Nunn. ``The security of the nation istoo important to have it take a back seat to election-yearpolitics,'' said Nunn.   The measure ``is a good bill, one that will definitelystrengthen our national security,'' he said.   Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,said Republicans want to use the bill ``to argue that Democrats areweak on defense,'' but he predicted the strategy would backfirebecause Democrats would unite against such charges.   The Wisconsin Democrat said the bill ``does less violence to thepresident's programs than previous bills'' that were not vetoed.   ``Why didn't the White house veto those bills?'' Aspin asked.``Because George Bush wasn't running for prersident, that's why.''   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and other senior advisers toReagan are urging him to sign the measure, according tocongressional sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The bill was passed July 14 by both the House and Senate. Themargin was 229-183 in the House and 64-30 in the Senate as bothDemocratic-led chambers generally split along party lines. Neithermargin would be large enough to overturn a Reagan veto.   For the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formallyknown, the bill authorizes $4 billion, slightly more than thecurrent SDI budget of $3.9 billion but far less than the $4.8billion Reagan wanted.   The bill also deeply reduced spending for the space-basedinterceptor, which is being developed as the first phase of aneventual SDI program. The Pentagon wanted $330 million for theprogram, but the bill restricts the total to $85 million.   The measure also requires the retirement of three agingmissile-firing Poseidon submarines as new subs are built. Thatcontinues the policy of generally keeping the United States nearweapons limits imposed by the unratified SALT II nuclear treaty, apolicy Reagan opposes.   The bill also directs the Energy Department to prepare for acomprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests, a longtime goal of armscontrol supporters.   The measure bans flight testing of ``depressed trajectorymissiles'' as long as the Soviets refrain from testing theirversions of those weapons, a ban opposed by the administration.   Fitzwater said Reagan believes the Star Wars cuts are too deepand the measure ``restructures many of the spending priorities inthe Defense Department (and) ... ties our hands in many casesrelated to arms control negotiations.''</TEXT></DOC>
