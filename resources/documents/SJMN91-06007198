Because the original product was made with geneticallymodified bacteria, environmental activists feared it would alter the naturalbalance, prompting them to attack several Bay Area test sites.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TAKING THE BITE OUT OF FROSTCROP-SAVING BACTERIUM COMES BACK  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     But this time, its developers are taking a different approach. Rather thancells engineered in the laboratory, the new Frostban consists solely ofnatural bacteria. Technicians have used the microbes in small fieldexperiments in California and Washington. And the company expects the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency to approve large-scale outdoor trials -- onplots of 200 to 300 acres -- &quot;any day now.&quot;;    &quot;It has passed all the safetytests,&quot; said Trevor Suslow, director of microbial pesticides at FrostTechnology Corp., formed to commercialize Frostban after the 1988 merger ofDNA Plant Technology Corp. and Advanced Genetic Sciences Inc. &quot;Things arelooking very positive.&quot;;    If Frostban wins regulatory approval, backers sayit could be used to control frost on crops from apples and grapes to almondsand artichokes. U.S. agriculture loses about $1.6 billion a year infrost-damaged produce, presenting a market for frost-inhibiting technologyestimated at $300 million a year.;    Even so, Suslow and others say thatFrostban would not have prevented the hundreds of millions of dollars ofdamage caused by last month's devastating cold snap. While Frostban hasprevented frost from forming on tomatoes at temperatures as low as 23 degreesFahrenheit for several hours, its target range is 25 degrees and above.;   &quot;Most winters around here, it would have been quite successful,&quot; said StevenLindow, a plant pathologist at the University of California, Berkeley whohelped develop the technology behind Frostban. &quot;But this was just too cold.&quot;;   Still, Lindow thinks the freeze could help revive interest in bacterialfrost protection techniques. He says California growers have been spoiled inrecent years by unseasonably warm weather, prompting them to growfrost-sensitive crops without adequate safeguards.;    &quot;I would think itshould be an eye-opener for them. The almond growers who look at their citrusfriends that have been wiped out should realize that could happen to them aswell,&quot; he says.;    The microbes that make up Frostban are PseudomonasSyringae, bacteria that live on garden plants worldwide. Although common, thespecialized Pseudomonas are usually outnumbered by other bacteria, whichcontain a chemical structure that serves as the nucleus for ice crystals.Frostban introduces the Pseudomonas in quantities large enough to displaceother bacteria, thereby lowering the temperature at which frost will form.;   Frostban's progress is being closely watched by the state's agricultureindustry. The California Tree Fruit Agreement, which represents pear, peachand plum growers, has invested $100,000 in Frostban research and providedsites for numerous field tests.;    Because the new strain is a naturalbacterium, Agreement manager John Field says he thinks it will prove far lesscontroversial than the altered variety.;    &quot;It's already there anyway,&quot; Fieldsaid. &quot;I don't feel the concerns are the same as with the geneticallyengineered (variety). If it's economically viable, (the growers) will use it.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TOM SCHMITZ, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910107  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  595  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday January 7, 199100007198,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
