(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 18-month-old twins had been deadat least 14 hours when they were found in their sheetless crib Dec.20, 1983. One weighed 14 pounds, the other 11, less than half thenormal weight of babies their age.   They had starved to death in the middle of the largest city inwestern Massachusetts. In the middle of a housing project. Beforethe eyes of their mother.   Valarie Miller, 33, was sentenced Oct. 8, 1987, to six to nineyears in state prison after pleading guilty to two counts ofmanslaughter by negligence, but the judge cut the sentence to oneyear in prison and five years' probation.   Detective Capt. Ernest Stelzer said the case was the mostextreme case of negligence he had seen in 24 years on the force.Medical Examiner Loren Mednick testified at the inquest that thechildren had no fat around their organs and were so dehydrated theylacked even eye fluid.   The case took Hampden County District Attorney Matthew J. Ryanmore than three years to resolve because of constant proceduraldelays, and the inquest results, from 1984, were made public onlyrecently.   Miller refused to be interviewed, but now that she is in prison,neighbors are talking and court records and interviews help paintthe painful picture of how it happened.   Latashia and Latoya Miller were born June 6, 1982, a monthearly. Although underdeveloped, they appeared healthy to statesocial workers and checked out fine with doctors up through theirlast visit in August 1983.   Their mother, however, seemed depressed. ``I had the feelingthat she was perhaps overwhelmed by the care of two children,''Barbara Buell, a nurse with the Early Childhood Service Team whovisited the family until the twins were 6 months old, testified atthe inquest.   A small, solitary woman, Miller lived with the twins in atwo-bedroom apartment in a project tucked into a residentialneighborhood of Springfield. Buell said the apartment was alwaysneat when she visited, but was devoid of toys or other signs ofchildren.   ``You'd never think the children were living with her,'' shesaid in a recent interview.   She also said the mother resisted help.   ``I know everybody made efforts to keep her in counseling andthey weren't too successful,'' Buell said. ``Oh, sure, she'd showup, but she'd just sit there and look away from you.''   Neighbors said Miller socialized in the summertime, oftenbringing the babies to barbeques held nightly in the yards of thedozen red, white and blue four-family apartment houses.   She drank, the neighbors said.   She also visited other apartments for what appeared to be anafternoon drinking ritual, they said.   The twins were left behind on those occasions.   ``Some of the time she came back she was high or juststaggering,'' a downstairs neighbor, Earl Harris, testified at theinquest.   The twins' father, Harrison Wright, visitedeach Thursday. Amarried man who'd met Miller at a bar where they worked, Wrightlived with his family on the other side of town but testified thathe sneaked away regularly to see his out-of-wedlock daughters,bringing them diapers and cookies ``when I have an extra couple ofdollars.''   Wright testified that they were fed ``adult food, like mashedpotatoes,'' and that when he mentioned their thinness to theirmother, she told him they had a cold and weren't eating properly.   A week before the twins died, Gloria Green, who lived across thestreet, sais she saw them lying in their crib, ``a bottle in eachhand and nothing in the bottle.''   Despite the clues, however, ``it didn't dawn on me she wasn'ttaking care of them,'' she said in an interview. She added that shewas afraid to report Miller, a fear experts say is common tofriends and relatives of alcoholics.   ``If you see somebody coughing to death, you say, `How aboutgetting to a doctor?' But alcoholism is another thing,'' saidCollette Ross, a counselor at Alcoholism Services of GreaterSpringfield. ``People feel they are infringing on the alcoholic'sright to privacy.''   Miller's boyfriend, Bobbie L. Stovall, testified that he andMiller spent the evening of Dec. 19 and the early hours of Dec. 20,1983, at her apartment, drinking vodka and beer. She later toldpolice the children ``fussed all night. They cried, but that is notunusual, they do that sometime. I checked on them and they wereOK.''   The police say she added: ``I don't remember if I fed the kidstoday or not. It might have been yesterday. I think I gave themsome water today.''   Late that day, after she had slept some hours, she visitedGreen, drank two beers and a half-pint of vodka, left and 20minutes later called Green from a pay phone, according to policereports and interviews.   Sobbing, and with loud music playing in the background, ``shesaid, `I need a drink bad.' She said she was having a lot ofproblems, but she wouldn't say what,'' Green said.   Not long afterwards, in the early evening, a few neighbors werein a downstairs apartment when Miller ran to them crying, ``No! No!My babies is dead, both of them.''   Harris, the neighbor, ran upstairs and found the children ontheir sides, ``staring at one another,'' he later testified. Theywere pronounced dead at the local hospital.   On Jan. 25, 1985, more than two years after her babies witheredaway in their crib, Miller pleaded guilty to two counts ofmanslaughter by negligence and two counts of failing to supplyadequate care and guidance.   When it came time for sentencing, Assistant District AttorneyElizabeth Scheibel urged Hampden County Superior Court Judge GeorgeC. Keady Jr. to imprison Miller for an unspecified period, saying:   ``Motherhood carries great responsibility and Miss Miller didnot live up to that responsibility. Here alcoholism should notexcuse what she did or didn't do.''   ``I cannot disagree,'' Keady replied. ``I don't think we canforget about these two children. Even back to pregnancy, thesechildren were at her mercy.''   After the inquest, free on personal recognizance, Miller livedfor a time with her mother. She had another child, despite birthcontrol counseling.   The boy, who recently turned 2, also failed to thrive under hercare. He was placed temporarily in a foster home and then put inthe custody of his grandmother, Audrey Young, joining Miller's11-year-old daughter, who has lived with Young since infancy.   ``She was an alcoholic, that was her problem,'' Young said abouther daughter. ``She was never a bad girl. I never had any problemwith her.''   The nurse who tried to help Miller said alcohol counselingsimply failed.   ``This was a case that more or less seemed to defeat thesystem,'' Buell said. ``She couldn't be helped.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 1</NOTE></DOC>
