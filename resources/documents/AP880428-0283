Hugh Liedtke told shareholders Thursday at thecompany's annual meeting.   ``The short of it is, we haven't fully decided on the rightcourse,'' Liedtke said. ``It would avail our shareholders and ouremployees little to have won this settlement only to lose a portionof its value through hasty or ill-considered actions.''   Liedtke, who is giving up his position as Pennzoil's chiefexecutive officer but remaining as chairman, said the board wouldbe considering a number of investments in coming months.   During a news conference following the shareholders meeting,neither Liedtke nor Pennzoil President Randal B. McDonald wouldoffer many specifics other than to say the company would strivetoward a balance between acquisitions of oil and gas reserves, anda balance between exploration and production activities andrefining and marketing activities.   Liedtke said top company officials had a list of 25-30 companiesunder consideration for investment, of which about six have beenexamined in detail.   Publicity about the huge payment to Pennzoil had brought with ita deluge of suggestions of how the money should be spent, Liedtkesaid.   ``They range all over the place,'' he said. ``One man inLiverpool wants to take his wife to Paris.''   After the meeting, the company announced that its first-quarterearnings jumped 71 percent, bolstered by higher refinery marginsand a one-time gain from the early redemption of a bond issue.   Pennzoil said it earned $20.7 million, or 41 cents per share,compared with $12.1 million, or 20 cents per share, in the sameperiod a year ago.   During the first quarter, the company experienced an after-taxgain of $6.9 million, or 17 cents per share, through an earlydebenture redemption.   Revenues totaled $485 million, compared with $445 million forthe same period in 1987, the company said.   Higher prices for natural gas and larger sales volumes bolstereda gain in Pennzoil's oil and gas segment to $27 million from $17.5million in the 1987 first quarter, it said.   Operating income from the company's products division fell to$28.4 million from $33 million during the same period in 1987,mostly due to lower sales volumes and margins on its motor oil,Pennzoil said.   First quarter operating income from the company's sulphurdivision was $11.9 million, down from $16.5 million during thefirst three months of 1987, the company said.   Liedtke, who has been Pennzoil's chief executive officer for 35years, received a standing ovation following his address toshareholders. Afterward, he told reporters he planned to spend moretime with his family, as well as reading and travelling, in theyears ahead.</TEXT></DOC>
