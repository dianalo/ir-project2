(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new state law regulating the use ofgenetically altered plants and animals strikes a balance betweenprotecting the public and letting companies test new technology,some environmentalists say.   At a news conference Thursday in Washington, a coalition ofbiotechnology companies and environmentalists praised the law as anational model, and said it will boost North Carolina's role inbiotechnology, the search for better, hardier plants and animals.   ``Citizens can be informed participants in thedecision-making,'' said Rebecca Goldburg of the EnvironmentalDefense Fund.   But Andrew Kimbrell, a lawyer for a group that opposes fieldtesting of genetically engineered organisms, denounced the law,especially the provision that prevents local authorities frombanning experiments.   ``They're playing ecological roulette with communities,'' hesaid, because the full impact of new organisms is unknown.   Kimbrell's group, the Foundation on Economic Trends, is headedby Jeremy Rifkin, a prominent critic of biotechnology.   The law was enacted by the Legislature on Wednesday as part ofbudget legislation. It establishes a 10-member state board thatwill review applications by companies to take genetically alteredplants and animals out of the laboratory and into the field.   The board can require public hearings before granting suchpermits and can decide what information is made public. Thatprovision is intended to make sure any potential adverse effects ofa test are not kept secret under the pretense of being confidentialbusiness information, said Gerry Hancock, a Durham lawyer andformer chairman of the quasi-public N.C. Biotechnology Center.</TEXT></DOC>
