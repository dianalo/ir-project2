(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Students at a conservativeChristian school were given National Rifle Association coloringbooks on gun safety Friday, and the superintendent dismissed anycriticism as ``ridiculous and non-scholarly.''   The Christian Liberty Academy distributed the six-page books tostudents from kindergarten through fifth grade.   ``They're constantly being exposed to guns on TV, at the movies,in the comics of every newspaper'' said the Rev. Paul Lindstrom,superintendent of the 325-student school and its affiliates andhome-schooling program, which involve a total of 25,000 pupils.   ``If we get good feedback we'll order more'' books for otherschools, he said.   ``Children coming across an actual gun will be inquisitive. Ninechances out of 10 they'll pick it up and finger it. Chances are theywill get hurt,'' Lindstrom said.   ``We teach them to honor their father and mother and God by notplaying with it.''   ``My Gun Safety Book'' features two children who find a handgunon a table. If children find a gun, the book stresses, they shouldleave it alone, leave the scene and tell their parents.   Some educators and law enforcement officials believe such a booktakes the wrong approach because it assumes guns will be availableto children. Some critics say the NRA, the nation's strongestadvocate of the rights of gun owners, should have no role ineducating youngsters.   But Tracey Martin, who heads the coloring book project for theNRA, said the organization has promoted gun safety for 117 years andthe book is ``just part of our continuing obligation.''   Lindstrom also dismissed criticism of the effort.   ``It's a knee-kerk reaction that is ridiculous andnon-scholarly,'' he said.   The conservative activist, who spent 10 days in an Atlanta jailafter protesting at abortion clinics in August, said he's interestedin the safety of children.   ``I don't have any great love for the American Civil LibertiesUnion, but if the ACLU comes out with a coloring book that says youshouldn't go with strangers who offer candy, I'll use that coloringbook in the school,'' Lindstrom said.   ``I'm an educator. I'm interested in the message,'' Lindstromsaid. ``We use books from all kinds of publishers. They might haveall kinds of political agendas.''   Ms. Martin said said Friday from NRA headquarters in Washingtonthat the Christian Liberty Academy got the books through JimZangrilli, an NRA board member in the west Chicago suburb of OakPark.   She said the organization has not formally started a campaign todistribute the books.   ``We haven't done any promotion of it. We don't really have theclassroom kits finished yet,'' she said.   However, public schools in Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska andPennsylvania have requested copies, she said, declining to namespecific schools without their permission. The book also is beingconsidered by Chicago public school officials, said school boardspokesman Ken Moses.</TEXT></DOC>
