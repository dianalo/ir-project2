SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The high-flying portable computer market willsoar to greater heights through the wizardry of notebook-sizedmachines, tiny color screens and images that ``float,'' industryexperts predict.   Not everyone goes so far as New York retailer James V. Cosby,who flatly predicted Tuesday: ``They are going to replacedesktops.''   But from one-pound ``palmtops'' to 20-pounders, there's no doubtabout the sales portables are racking up, or the attention they aredrawing at this year's Comdex convention, the world's biggestcomputer show.   The overall personal computer market is growing about 10 percenta year. But sales of portables are expected to triple that growthrate for the next three years, and sales of machines in the8{-by-11-inch ``notebook'' format will more than quadruple,predicted Tim Bajarin, executive vice president of CreativeStrategies International and a leading Silicon Valley consultant.   About 300,000 portables were shipped in the United States in1983, the first year true portables were available, he said at apanel discussion.   Bajarin expects shipments of 1.4 million this year and 2.5million by 1992.   Perhaps hottest of all at the show are Compaq Computer Corp.'ssix-pound, notebook-size LTE and LTE286 machines. They are thefirst of their size to accept 3{-inch floppy disks which are nowstandard for desktop computers.   Compaq officials say their new models are more convenient thanother machines which use tiny memory cards or smaller disks _although makers of other models contend the cards are tomorrow'stechnology.   Compaq officials say they have struggled to meet demand in themonth since they introduced the two machines. The LTE begins atabout $2,400. The LTE286, which runs on a faster 80286microprocessor, lists for $3,900 to $5,000.   Among the competing high-performance notebook-size computers arethe Toshiba T1000SE and NEC's Ultralite, a pioneer when it wasintroduced a year ago. The Ultralite weighs just 4.4 pounds, has abigger screen than the LTE's, and costs about the same. Storage ofinformation is on memory cards.   Also hot are the one-pound mini-machines known as palmtops orbreast pocket computers. Atari's Portfolio, which operates on twoAA batteries for 48 hours, fits in a jacket pocket and sells for$400. Not intended to rival its bigger and more expensive cousins,it has five simple built-in programs.   At about $2,000, Poqet Computer Corp.'s palmtop offers a biggerscreen and keyboard, all within the tiny package.   ``Our computer now uses about the same amount of power as asingle Christmas tree twinkle light,'' meaning it can run for 100hours on two AA alkaline batteries, said Poquet's president, StaveProdromou.   Near the other extreme is Dolch Computer Systems' ``portable''that uses Intel's new 80486 microprocessor _ the hottest, mostpowerful chip in the world for personal computers.   The industrial-looking Dolch weighs nearly 20 pounds, but thecompany says it can compete in performance with very high-enddesktop computers and work stations. Its price is hefty, too: about$13,000 to $18,000.   Also on display was a laptop called Gridpad. It uses a pen-likedevice to ``write'' on a document-sized screen, allowing forms tobe filled out and even signed on a computer screen.   Cyberspace's laptop does away with a screen in favor of headgearthat projects a hologram-like image that seems to hang in the airin front of the user. It's pitched as a boon for thesecurity-conscious; no one can look over your shoulder and see whatyou're writing or reading.</TEXT></DOC>
