(<T3>See </T3>28 CFR part 41 (section 504 coordination regulation for federallyassisted programs).) This general parallelism is in accord with the intentexpressed by supporters of the 1978 amendment in floor debate, includingits sponsor, Rep. James M. Jeffords, that the Federal Government shouldhave the same section 504 obligations as recipients of Federal financialassistance. 124 Cong. Rec. 13901 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Jeffords); 124Cong. Rec. E2668, E2670 (daily ed. May 17, 1978) <T3>id</T3>.; 124 Cong. Rec. 13897 (remarks of Rep. Brademas); <T3>id</T3>. at 38552 (remarks of Rep. Sarasin).There are, however, some language differences between this proposed ruleand the Federal Government's section 504 regulations for federally assistedprograms. These changes are based on the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Southeastern Community College </T3>v. <T3>Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979), and the subsequent circuit court decisionsinterpreting <T3>Davis </T3>and section 504. <T3> See Dopico </T3>v. Goldschmidt, 687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association </T3>v. Lewis, 655 F.2d 1272 (D.C.Cir. 1981) (<T3>APTA</T3>); <T3>see also Rhode Island Handicapped Action Committee </T3>v. <T3>Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, </T3>718 F.2d 490 (1st Cir.1983).These language differences are also supported by the decision of the SupremeCourt in <T3>Alexander </T3>v. <T3>Choate, </T3>469 U.S. 287 (1985), where the Court held that the regulationsfor federally assisted programs did not require a recipient to modify itsdurational limitation on Medicaid coverage of inpatient hospital care forhandicapped persons. Clarifying its <T3>Davis </T3>decision, the Court explained that section 504 requiresonly ``reasonable'' modifications, <T3>id</T3>. at 300, and explicitly noted that ``(the regulations implementingandSection; 504 (for federally assisted programs) are consistent with theview that <T3>reasonable </T3>adjustments in the nature of the benefit offered mustat times be made to assure meaningful access.'' <T3>Id</T3>. at 301 n.21 (emphasis added).Incorporation of these changes, therefore, makes this regulation implementingsection 504 for federally conducted programs consistent with the FederalGovernment's regulations implementing section 504 for federally assistedprograms as they have been interpreted by the Supreme Court. Many of thesefederally assisted regulations were issued prior to the interpretationsof section 504 by the Supreme Court in <T3>Davis, </T3>by lower courts interpreting <T3>Davis</T3>, and by the Supreme Court in <T3>Alexander</T3>; therefore their language does not reflect the interpretationof section 504 provided by the Supreme Court and by the various circuitcourts. Of course, these federally assisted regulations must be interpretedto reflect the holdings of the Federal judiciary. Hence the agencies believethat there are no significant differences between this proposed rule forfederally conducted programs and the Federal Government's interpretationof section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs.This regulation has been reviewed by the Department of Justice. It is anadaptation of a prototype prepared by the Department of Justice under ExecutiveOrder 12250 (45 FR 72995, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 298) and distributed toExecutive agencies. This regulation has also been reviewed by the EqualOpportunity Commission under Executive Order 12067 (43 FR 28967, 3 CFR,1978 Comp., p. 206). It is not a major rule within the meaning of ExecutiveOrder 12291 (46 FR 13193, 3 CFR, 1981 Comp., p. 127) and, therefore, aregulatory impact analysis has not been prepared. This regulation doesnot have an impact on small entities. It is not, therefore, subject tothe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612).<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG>Section 1214.101 PurposeSection 1214.101 states the purpose of the proposed rule, which is to effectuatesection 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and DevelopmentalDisabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap in programsor activities conducted by Executive agencies or the United States PostalService.Section 1214.102 ApplicationThe proposed regulation applies to all programs or activities conductedby the agency. Under this section, a federally conducted program or activityis, in simple terms, anything a Federal agency does. Aside from employment,there are two major categories of federally conducted programs or activitiescovered by this regulation: those involving general public contact as partof ongoing agency operations and those directly administered by the agencyfor program beneficiaries and participants. Activities in the first categoryinclude communication with the public (telephone contacts, office walk-ins,or interviews) and the public's use of the agency's facilities. Activitiesin the second category include programs that provide Federal services orbenefits. This regulation does not, however, apply to programs or activitiesconducted outside the United States that do not involve individuals withhandicaps in the United States.Section 1214.103 Definitions<T3>Agency. </T3>For purposes of this regulation ``agency'' means ACTION.<T3>Assistant Attorney General. </T3>Refers to the Assistant Attorney General,Civil Rights Division, United States Department of Justice.<T3>Auxiliary aids. </T3>``Auxiliary aids'' means services or devices thatenable persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to havean equal opportunity to participate in and enjoy the benefits of the agency'sprograms or activities. The definition provides examples of commonly usedauxiliary aids. Although auxiliary aids are required explicitly only byandSection; 1214.160(a)(1), they may also be necessary to meet other requirementsof the regulation.<T3>Complete complaint. </T3>``Complete complaint'' is defined to includeall the information necessary to enable the agency to investigate the complaint.The definition is necessary, because the 180-day period for the agency'sinvestigation (see andSection; 1214.179(g)) begins when the agency receivesa complete complaint.<T3>Facility.</T3> The definition of ``facility'' is similar to that inthe section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs,28 CFR 41.3(f), except that the term ``rolling stock or other conveyances''has been added and the phrase ``or interest in such property'' has beendeleted because the term ``facility,'' as used in this regulation, refersto structures and not to intangible property rights. It should, however,be noted that the regulation applies to all programs and activities conductedby the agency regardless of whether the facility in which they are conductedis owned, leased, or used on some other basis by the agency. The term ``facility''is used in andSection;andSection; 1214.149, 1214.150, and 1214.170(f).<T3>Individual with handicaps.</T3> The definition of ``individual withhandicaps'' is identical to the definition of ``handicapped person'' appearingin the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs(28 CFR 41.31). Although section 103(d) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendmentsof 1986 changed the statutory term ``handicapped individual'' to ``individualwith handicaps,'' the legislative history of this amendment indicates thatno substantive change was intended. Thus, although the term has been changedin this regulation to be consistent with the statute as amended, the definitionis unchanged. In particular, although the term as revised refers to ``handicaps''in the plural, it does not exclude persons who have only one handicap.<T3>Qualified individual with handicaps.</T3> The definition of ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' is a revised version of the definition of ``qualifiedhandicapped person'' appearing in the section 504 coordination regulationfor federally assisted programs (28 CFR 41.32).Paragraph (1) is an adaptation of existing definitions of ``qualified handicappedperson'' for purposes of federally assisted preschool, elementary, andsecondary education programs (<T3>see, e.g.,</T3> 45 CFR 84.3(k) (2)). It provides that an individualwith handicaps is qualified for preschool, elementary, or secondary educationprograms conducted by the agency, if he or she is a member of a class ofpersons otherwise entitled by statute, regulation, or agency policy toreceive these services from the agency. In other words, an individual withhandicaps is qualified, if, considering all factors other than the handicappingcondition, he or she is entitled to receive education services from theagency.Paragraph (2) deviates from existing regulations for federally assistedprograms because of intervening court decisions. It defines ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' with regard to any program other than thosecovered by paragraph (1) under which a person is required to perform servicesor to achieve a level of accomplishment. In such programs a qualified individualwith handicaps is one who can achieve the purpose of the program withoutmodifications in the program that the agency can demonstrate would resultin a fundamental alteration in its nature. This definition reflects thedecision of the Supreme Court in <T3>Davis.</T3> In that case, the Court ruled that a hearing-impaired applicantto a nursing school was not a ``qualified handicapped person'' becauseher hearing impairment would prevent her from participating in the clinicaltraining portion of the program. The Court found that, if the program weremodified so as to enable the respondent to participate (by exempting herfrom the clinical training requirements), ``she would not receive evena rough equivalent of the training a nursing program normally gives''.<T3>Id.</T3> at 410. It also found that ``the purpose of [the] programwas to train persons who could serve the nursing profession in all customaryways,'' <T3>id.</T3> at 413, and that the respondent would be unable, because ofher hearing impairment, to perform some functions expected of a registerednurse. It therefore concluded that the school was not required by section504 to make such modifications that would result in ``a fundamental alterationin the nature of the program.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 410.We have incorporated the Court's language in the definition of ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' in order to make clear that such a person mustbe able to participate in the program offered by the agency. The agencyis required to make modifications in order to enable an applicant withhandicaps to participate, but is not required to offer a program of a fundamentallydifferent nature. The test is whether, with appropriate modifications,the applicant can achieve the purpose of the program offered; not whetherthe applicant could benefit or obtain results from some other program thatthe agency does not offer. Although the revised definition allows exclusionof some individuals with handicaps from some programs, it requires thatan individual with handicaps who is capable of achieving the purpose ofthe program must be accommodated, provided that the modifications do notfundamentally alter the nature of the program.The agency has the burden of demonstrating that a proposed modificationwould constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature of its programor activity. Furthermore, in demonstrating that a modification would resultin such an alteration, the agency must follow the procedures establishedin andSection;andSection; 1214.150(a) and 1214.160(d), which are discussedbelow, for demonstrating that an action would result in undue financialand administrative burdens. That is, the decision must be made by the agencyhead or his or her designee in writing after consideration of all resourcesavailable for the program or activity and must be accompanied by an explanationof the reasons for the decision. If the agency head determines that anaction would result in a fundamental alteration, the agency must consideroptions that would enable the individual with handicaps to achieve thepurpose of the program but would not result in such an alteration. For programs or activities that do not fall under either of the first twoparagraphs, paragraph (3) adopts the existing definition of ``qualifiedhandicapped person'' with respect to services (28 CFR 41.32(b)) in thecoordination regulation for programs receiving Federal financial assistance.Under this definition, a qualified individual with handicaps is an individualwith handicaps who meets the essential eligibility requirements for participationin the program or activity. Paragraph (4) explains that ``qualified individual with handicaps'' means``qualified handicapped person'' as that term is defined for purposes ofemployment in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulationat 29 CFR 1613.702(f), which is made applicable to this part by andSection;1214.140. Nothing in this part changes existing regulations applicableto employment. <T3>Section 504. </T3>This definition makes clear that, as used in thisregulation, ``section 504'' applies only to programs or activities conductedby the agency and not to programs or activities to which it provides Federalfinancial assistance. Section 1214.110 Self-evaluation The agency shall conduct a self-evaluation of its compliance with section504 within one year of the effective date of this regulation. The self-evaluationrequirement is present in the existing section 504 coordination regulationfor programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR41.5(b)(2)). Experience has demonstrated the self-evaluation process tobe a valuable means of establishing a working relationship with individualswith handicaps that promotes both effective and efficient implementationof section 504. Section 1214.111 Notice Section 1214.111 requires the agency to disseminate sufficient informationto employees, applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and other interestedpersons to apprise them of the rights and protections afforded by section504 and this regulation. Methods of providing this information include,for example, the publication of information in handbooks, manuals, andpamphlets that are distributed to the public to describe the agency's programsand activities; the display of informative posters in service centers andother public places; and the broadcast of information by television orradio. Section 1214.130 General Prohibitions Against Discrimination Section 1214.130 is an adaptation of the corresponding section of the section504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receiving Federalfinancial assistance (28 CFR 41.51). Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 504. Theremaining paragraphs in andSection; 1214.130 establish the general principlesfor analyzing whether any particular action of the agency violates thismandate. These principles serve as the analytical foundation for the remainingsections of the regulation. if the agency violates a provision in any ofthe subsequent sections, it will also violate one of the general prohibitionsfound in andSection; 1214.130. When there is no applicable subsequent provision,the general prohibitions stated in this section apply.Paragraph (b) prohibits overt denials of equal treatment of individualswith handicaps. The agency may not refuse to provide an individual withhandicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from itsprogram simply because the person is handicapped. Such blatantly exclusionarypractices often result from the use of irrebuttable presumptions that absolutelyexclude certain classes of disabled persons (<T3>e.g., </T3>epileptics, hearing-imparied persons, persons with heartailments) from participation in programs or activities without regard toan individual's actual ability to participate. Use of an irrebuttable presumptionis permissible only when in all cases a physical condition by its verynature would prevent an individual from meeting the essential eligibilityrequirements for participation in the activity in question. It would bepermissible, therefore, to exclude without an individual evaluation allpersons who are blind in both eyes from eligibility for a license to operatea commercial vehicle in interstate commerce; but it may not be permissibleto automatically disqualify all those who are blind in just one eye. In addition, section 504, prohibits more than just the most obvious denialsof equal treatment. It is not enough to admit persons in wheelchairs toa program in the facilities in which the program is conducted are inaccessible.Paragraph (b)(l)(iii), therefore, requires that the opportunity to participateor benefit afforded to an individual with handicaps be as effective asthat afforded to others. The later sections on program accessibility (andSection;andSection;1214.149-1214.151) and communications (andSection; 1214.160) are specificapplications of this principle. Despite the mandate of paragraph (d) that the agency administer its programsand activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needsof qualified individuals with handicaps, paragraph (b)(1)(iv), in conjunctionwith paragraph (d), permits the agency to develop separate or differentaids, benefits, or services when necessary to provide individuals withhandicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from theagency's programs or activities. Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) requires that differentor separate aids, benefits, or services be provided only when necessaryto ensure that the aids, benefits, or services are as effective as thoseprovided to others. Even when separate or different aids, benefits, orservices would be more effective, paragraph (b)(2) provides that a qualifiedindividual with handicaps still has the right to choose to participatein the program that is not designed to accommodate individuals with handicaps.Paragraph (b)(1)(v) prohibits the agency from denying a qualified individualwith handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member of a planningof advisory board. Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) prohibits the agency from limiting a qualified individualwith handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, oropportunity enjoyed by others receiving any aid, benefit, or service. Paragraph (b)(3) prohibits the agency from utilizing criteria or methodsof administration that deny individuals with handicaps access to the agency'sprograms or activities. The phrase ``criteria or methods of administration''refers to official written agency policies and to the actual practicesof the agency. This paragraph prohibits both blatantly exclusionary policiesor practices and nonessential policies and practices that are neutral ontheir face, but deny individuals with handicaps an effective opportunityto participate. Paragraph (b)(4) specifically applies the prohibition enunciated in andSection;1214.130(b)(3) to the process of selecting sites for construction of newfacilities or selecting existing facilities to be used by the agency. Paragraph(b)(4) does not apply to construction of additional buildings at an existingsite. Paragraph (b)(5) prohibits the agency, in the selection of procurementcontractors, from using criteria that subject qualified individuals withhandicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap. Paragraph (c) provides that programs conducted pursuant to Federal statuteor Executive order that are designed to benefit only individuals with handicapsor a given class of individuals with handicaps may be limited to thoseindividuals with handicaps.Paragraph (d), discussed above, provides that the agency must administerprograms and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to theneeds of qualified individuals with handicaps, <T3>i.e., </T3>in a setting that enables individuals with handicaps tointeract with nonhandicapped persons to the fullest extent possible.Section 1214.140 EmploymentSection 1214.140 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in employmentby the agency. Courts have held that section 504, as amended in 1978, coversthe employment practices of Executive agencies. <T3>Gardner </T3>v. <T3>Morris</T3>, 752 F.2d 1271, 1277 (8th Cir. 1985); <T3>Smith </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service</T3>, 742 F.2d 257, 259-260 (6th Cir.1984); <T3>Prewitt </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service</T3>, 662 F.2d 292, 302-04 (5th Cir. 1981).<T3>Contra McGuiness </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service</T3>, 744 F.2d 1318, 1320-21 (7th Cir.1984); <T3>Boyd </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service</T3>, 752 F.2d 410, 413-14 (9th Cir. 1985).Courts uniformly have held that, in order to give effect to section 501of the Rehabilitation Act, which covers Federal employment, the administrativeprocedures of section 501 must be followed in processing complaints ofemployment discrimination under section 504. <T3>Morgan </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service</T3>, 798 F.2d 1162, 1164-65 (8th Cir.1986); <T3>Smith</T3>, 742 F.2d at 262; <T3>Prewitt</T3>, 662 F.2d at 304. Accordingly, andSection; 1214.140 (Employment)of this rule adopts the definitions, requirements, and procedures of section501 as established in regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission(EEOC) at 29 CFR part 1613. Responsibility for coordinating enforcementof Federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment is assigned tothe EEOC by Executive Order 12067 (3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 206). Under thisauthority, the EEOC establishes government-wide standards on nondiscriminationin employment on the basis of handicap. In addition to this section, andSection;1214.170(b) specifies that the agency will use the existing EEOC proceduresto resolve allegations of employment discrimination.Section 1214.149 Program Accessibility: Discrimination ProhibitedSection 1214.149 states the general nondiscrimination principle underlyingthe program accessibility requirements of andSection;andSection; 1214.150 and1214.151.Section 1214.150 Program Accessibility: Existing FacilitiesThis regulation adopts the program accessibility concept found in the existingsection 504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receivingFederal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.57), with certain modifications.Thus, andSection; 1214.150 requires that each agency program or activity,when viewed in its entirety, be readily accessible to and usable by individualswith handicaps. The regulation also makes clear that the agency is notrequired to make each of its existing facilities accessible (andSection;1214.150(a)(1)). However, andSection; 1214.150, unlike 28 CFR 41.57, placesexplicit limits on the agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility(andSection; 1214.150(a)(2)).Paragraph (a)(2) generally codifies recent case law that defines the scopeof the agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility. This paragraphprovides that, in meeting the program accessibility requirement, the agencyis not required to take any action that would result in a fundamental alterationin the nature of its program or activity or in undue financial and administrativeburdens. A similar limitation is provided in andSection; 1214.160(d). Thisprovision is based on the Supreme Court's holding in <T3>Southeastern Community College </T3>v. <T3>Davis</T3>, 442 U.S. 397 (1979), that section 504 does not requireprogram modifications that result in a fundamental alteration in the natureof a program, and on the Court's statement that section 504 does not requiremodifications that would result in ``undue financial and administrativeburdens''. 442 U.S. at 412. Since <T3>Davis, </T3>circuit courts have applied this limitation on a showingthat only one of the two ``undue burdens'' would be created as a resultof the modification sought to be imposed under section 504. <T3>See, e.g., Dopico </T3>v. <T3>Goldschmidt</T3>, 687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association </T3>v. <T3>Lewis</T3> (<T3>APTA</T3>), 655 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981).Paragraphs (a)(2) and 1214.160(d) are also supported by the Supreme Court'sdecision in <T3>Alexander </T3>v. <T3>Choate</T3>, 469 U.S. 287 (1985). <T3>Alexander</T3> involved a challenge to the State of Tennessee's reductionof inpatient hospital care coverage under Medicaid from 20 to 14 days peryear. Plaintiffs argued that this reduction violated section 504 becauseit had an adverse impact on handicapped persons. The Court assumed withoutdeciding that section 504 reaches at least some conduct that has an unjustifiabledisparate impact on handicapped people, but held that the reduction wasnot ``the sort of disparate impact'' discrimination that might be prohibitedby section 504 or its implementing regulation. <T3>Id. </T3>at 299.Relying on <T3>Davis, </T3>the Court said that section 504 guarantees qualified handicappedpersons ``meaningful access to the benefits that the grantee offers,''<T3>id.</T3> at 301, and that ``<T3>reasonable adjustments</T3> in the nature of the benefit being offeredmust at times be made to assure meaningful access.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at n.21 (emphasis added). However, section 504 does not require`` `changes,' `adjustments,' or `modifications' to existing programs thatwould be `substantial' * * * or that would constitute `fundamental alteration(s)in the nature of a program!'' <T3>Id. </T3>at n.20 (citations omitted). <T3>Alexander</T3> supports the position, based on <T3>Davis</T3> and the earlier, lower court decisions, that in some situations,certain accommodations for a handicapped person may so alter an agency'sprogram or activity, or entail such extensive costs and administrativeburdens that the refusal to undertake the accommodations is not discriminatory.Thus failure to include such an ``undue burdens'' provision could leadto judicial invalidation of the regulation or reversal of a particularenforcement action taken pursuant to the regulation.This paragraph, however, does not establish an absolute defense; it doesnot relieve the agency of all obligations to individuals with handicaps.Although the agency is not required to take actions that would result ina fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in unduefinancial and administrative burdens, it nevertheless must take any othersteps necessary to ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefitsand services of the federally conducted program or activity.It is our view that compliance with andSection; 1214.150(a) would in mostcases not result in undue financial and administrative burdens on the agency.In determining whether financial and administrative burdens are undue,all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation ofthe conducted program or activity should be considered. The burden of provingthat compliance with andSection; 1214.150(a) would fundamentally alter thenature of a program or activity or would result in undue financial andadministrative burdens rests with the agency. The decision that compliancewould result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency heador his or her designee and must be accompanied by a written statement ofthe reasons for that conclusion. Any person who believes that he or sheor any specific class of persons has been injured by the agency head'sdecision or failure to make a decision may file a complaint under the complianceprocedures established in andSection; 1214.170.Paragraph (b) sets forth a number of means by which program accessibilitymay be achieved, including redesign of equipment, reassignment of servicesto accessible buildings, and provision of aides. In choosing among methods,the agency shall give priority consideration to those that will be consistentwith provision of services in the most integrated setting appropriate tothe needs of individuals with handicaps. Structural changes in existingfacilities are required only when there is no other feasible way to makethe agency's program accessible. It should be noted that ``structural changes''include all physical changes to a facility; the term does not refer onlyto changes to structural features, such as removal of or alterations toa load-bearing structural member. The agency may comply with the programaccessibility requirement by delivering services at alternate accessiblesites or making home visits as appropriate.Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the programaccessibility requirement. As currently required for federally assistedprograms by 28 CFR 41.57(b), the agency must make any necessary structuralchanges in facilities as soon as practicable, but in no event later thanthree years after the effective date of this regulation. Where structuralmodifications are required, a transition plan shall be developed withinsix months of the effective date of this regulation. Aside from structuralchanges, all other necessary steps to achieve compliance should be takenwithin sixty days.Section 1214.151 Program accessibility: New Construction and AlterationsOverlapping coverage exists with respect to new construction and alterationsunder section 504 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended(42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). Section 1214.151 provides that those buildings thatare constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of, the agencyshall be designed, constructed, or altered to be readily accessible toand usable by individuals with handicaps in accordance with 41 CFR 101-19.600to 101-19.607. This standard was promulgated pursuant to the ArchitecturalBarriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). We believe thatit is appropriate to adopt the existing Architectural Barriers Act standardfor section 504 compliance here because new and altered buildings subjectto this regulation are also subject to the Architectural Barriers Act andbecause adoption of this standard will avoid duplicative and possibly inconsistentstandards.Existing buildings leased by the agency after the effective date of thisregulation are not required by the regulation to meet accessibility standardssimply by virtue of being leased. They are subject, however, to the programaccessibility standard for existing facilities in andSection; 1214.150. Tothe extent the buildings are newly constructed or altered, they must alsomeet the new construction and alteration requirements of andSection; 1214.151.Federal practice under section 504 has always treated newly leased buildingsas subject to the existing facilities program accessibility standard. Unlikethe construction of new buildings where architectural barriers can be avoidedat little or no cost, the application of new construction standards toan existing building being leased raises the same prospect of retrofittingbuildings as the use of an existing Federal facility, and the agency believesthe same program accessibility standard should apply to both owned andleased existing buildings. In <T3>Rose</T3> v. <T3>United States Postal Service,</T3> 774 F.2d 1355 (9th Cir. 1985), theNinth Circuit held that the Architectural Barriers Act requires accessibilityat the time of lease. The <T3>Rose</T3> court did not address the issue of whether section 504 likewiserequires accessibility as a condition of lease, and the case was remandedto the District Court for, among other things, consideration of that issue.The agency may provide more specific guidance on section 504 requirementsfor leased buildings after the litigation is completed. Section 1214.160 Communications Section 1214.160 requires the agency to take appropriate steps to ensureeffective communication with personnel of other Federal entities, applicants,participants, and members of the public. These steps shall include proceduresfor determining when auxiliary aids are necessary under andSection;1214.160(a)(1)to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participatein, and enjoy the benefits of, the agency's program or activity. They shallalso include an opportunity for individuals with handicaps to request theauxiliary aids of their choice. This expressed choice shall be given primaryconsideration by the agency (andSection;1214.160(a)(1)(i)). The agency shallhonor the choice unless it can demonstrate that another effective meansof communication exists or that use of the means chosen would not be requiredunder andSection;1214.160(d). That paragraph limits the obligation of theagency to ensure effective communication in accordance with <T3>Davis</T3> and the circuit court opinions interpreting it (<T3>see supra</T3> premable discussion of andSection;1214.160(a)(2)). Unlessnot required by andSection;1214.160(d), the agency shall provide auxiliaryaids at no cost to the individual with handicaps. The discussion of andSection;1214.150(a), Program accessibility: Existingfacilities, regarding the determination of undue financial and administrativeburdens also applies to this section and should be referred to for a completeunderstanding of the agency's obligation to comply with andSection;1214.160.In some circumstances, a notepad and written materials may be sufficientto permit effective communication with a person with impaired hearing.In many circumstances, however, they may not be, particularly when theinformation being communicated is complex or exchanged for a lengthy periodof time (<T3>e.g.</T3>, a meeting) or where the applicant or participant is notskilled in spoken or written language. In these cases, a sign languageinterpreter may be appropriate. For persons with impaired vision, effectivecommunication might be achieved by several means, including readers andaudio recordings. In general, the agency intends to inform the public of(1) the communications services it offers to afford individuals with handicapsan equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from its programs oractivities, (2) the opportunity to request a particular mode of communication,and (3) the agency's preferences regarding auxiliary aids if it can demonstratethat several different modes are effective. The agency shall ensure effective communication with persons with impairedvision or hearing involved in hearings conducted by the agency. Auxiliaryaids must be afforded where necessary to ensure effective communicationat the proceedings. If sign language interpreters are necessary, the agencymay require that it be given reasonable notice prior to the proceedingof the need for an interpreter. Moreover, the agency need not provide individuallyprescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devicesof a personal nature (andSection;1214.160(a)(1)(ii)). For example, the agencyneed not provide eye glasses or hearing aids to applicants or participantsin its programs. Similarly, the regulation does not require the agencyto provide wheelchairs to persons with mobility impairments. Paragraph (b) requires the agency to provide information to individualswith handicaps concerning accessible services, activities, and facilities.Paragraph (c) requires the agency to provide a sign at inaccessible facilitiesthat directs users to locations with information about accessible facilities.Section 1214.170 Compliance Procedures Paragraph (a) specifies that paragraphs (c) through (1) of this sectionestablish the procedures for processing complaints other than employmentcomplaints. Paragraph (b) provides that the agency will process employmentcomplaints, in accordance with procedures established in existing regulationsof the EEOC (29 CFR Part 1613) pursuant to section 501 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791). The agency is required to accept and investigate all complete complaintsfor which it has jurisdiction (andSection;1214.170(d)). If it determinesthat it does not have jurisdiction over a complaint, it shall promptlynotify the complainant and make reasonable efforts to facilitate the referralof the complaint to any appropriate entity of the Federal government (andSection;1214.170(e)).Paragraph (f) requires the agency to notify the Architectural and TransportationBarriers Compliance Board upon receipt of a complaint alleging that a buildingor facility subject to the Architectural Barriers Act was designed, constructed,or altered in a manner that does not provide ready access to and use byindividuals with handicaps. Paragraph (g) requires the agency to provide to the complainant, in writing,findings of fact and conclusions of law, the relief granted if noncomplianceis found, and notice of the right to appeal (andSection;1214.170(g)). Oneappeal within the agency shall be provided (andSection;1214.170(i)). Theappeal will not be heard by the same person who made the initial determinationof compliance or noncompliance. Paragraph (1) permits the agency to delegate its authority for investigatingcomplaints to other Federal agencies. However, the statutory obligationof the agency to make a final determination of compliance or noncompliancemay not be delegated. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 1214 </ITAG>Blind, Buildings, Civil rights, Equal educational opportunity, Equal employmentopportunity, Federal buildings and facilities, Government employees, Handicapped.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Chapter 45 of the Code of FederalRegulations is proposed to be amended as follows:Part 1214 is added to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1214_ENFORCEMENT OF NONDISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF HANDICAPIN PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY ACTION </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.101 Purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.102 Application. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.103 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.104-1214.109 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.110 Self-evaluation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.111 Notice. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.112-1214.129 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.1130 General prohibitions against discrimination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.131-1214.139 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.140 Employment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.141-1214.148 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.149 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.150 Program accessibility: Existing facilities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.151 Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.152-1214.159 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.160 Communications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.161-1214.169 [Reserved] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.170 Compliance procedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1214.171-1214.999 [Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 29 U.S.C. 794; 42 U.S.C. 5057. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1214.101</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose. </ITAG>The purpose of this part is to effectuate section 119 of the Rehabilitation,Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978,which amended section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to prohibitdiscrimination on the basis of handicap in programs or activities conductedby Executive agencies or the United States Postal Service. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1214.102</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Application. </ITAG>This part applies to all programs or activities conducted by the agency,except for programs or activities conducted outside the United States thatdo not involve individuals with handicaps in the United States. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1214.103</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>For purposes of this part, the term_ <T3>Agency</T3> means ACTION. <T3>Assistant Attorney General</T3> means the Assistant Attorney General,Civil Rights Division, United States Department of Justice. <T3>Auxiliary aids</T3> means services or devices that enable persons withimpaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equal opportunityto participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, programs or activities conductedby the agency.
