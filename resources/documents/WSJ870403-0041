Under the agreement, Los Angeles-based Univisa will market the franchises and also will translate National Video's videotapes into Spanish. National Video operates 700 video stores in the U.S. and Canada.    As part of the agreement, Univisa will receive options to acquire as many as 200,000 National Video common shares for $6 each until April 1990, and $9 each for an additional two-year period. That part of the agreement is subject to approval by National Video's board.    National Video has 3.5 million shares outstanding. Its shares closed yesterday in national over-the-counter trading at $2.75, off 12.5 cents.    National Video franchises cost $14,900 to $29,900 and require an initial investment by the franchisee of $100,000 to $389,000, depending on location and type. </TEXT></DOC>
