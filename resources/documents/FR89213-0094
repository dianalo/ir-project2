Studies indicate that manyphysicians are ambivalent concerning their role in diagnosing and treatingpatients with alcohol and other drug abuse problems, and have a low rateof problem recognition. Reasons cited for physicians' reluctance to intervenewith patients with alcohol and other drug abuse problems include negativeattitudes, pessimism about the possibility of recovery, and lack of confidencein their clinical skills to manage patients with these problems (Kamerow,1986; Rohman, 1987). Physicians and nurses constitute a large manpowerpool that can have substantial impact on the prevention and managementof alcohol and other drug abuse problems. These health professionals arein a unique position to provide routine screening for alcohol and drugabuse and to provide general health counseling concerning alcohol and druguse and abuse. There is a need to ensure that all medical and nursing schoolsprovide appropriate clinical training in alcohol and other drug abuse.Alcohol and drug abuse education assessment studies conducted by six nationalmedical specialty organizations highlight the need to incorporate alcoholand other drug abuse instruction throughout their preclinical and clinicalteaching programs. One of the major impediments to effective alcohol anddrug teaching cited in these reports is the lack of skilled faculty whocan serve as role models for clinical teaching. A recent survey of alcoholand drug abuse education in schools of nursing indicated that these topicsreceive insufficient attention in the nursing curriculum (Hoffman,1987).The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and theNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recognize the critical role ofmedical and nursing schools in training health providers to efectivelyrecognize, diagnose, intervene, treat and/or refer alcohol and other drugabuse problems. The Institutes seek to stimulate these schools to conductfaculty development programs to address this need. To assist schools inthis objective, NIAAA and NIDA have supported the development of curriculummodels, designed to demonstrate methods of integrating alcohol and drugabuse instruction into medical and nursing clinical training programs.The model curricula are based upon discipline-specific knowledge and skillobjectives, and address undergraduate, graduate, and faculty training needs.Curriculum models address the following medical specialties: General InternalMedicine, Family Medicine, Psychiatry, Pediatrics, and OB/GYN. Within nursing,curriculum models are being developed for undergraduate core courses andfor selected graduate nursing specialties. Information on these projectsmay be obtained directly from the curriculum model program directors (seeattached list). A resource manual of sample curriculum models and instructionalmaterials will be available from NIAAA in the Fall of 1989. The currentissue of NIAAA's <T3>Alcohol Health and Research World,</T3> (Volume 13, No. 1, 1989) isdevoted to alcohol and drug abuse clinical training. This issue is availablefrom the National Clearinghouse on Alcohol and Drug Abuse Information (NCADI),P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, Maryland 20852, 301/468-2600.In fiscal year 1989, NIAAA in consultation with NIDA, will make clinicaltraining grant awards for Physician and Nursing Faculty Development inAlcohol and Drug Abuse. It is anticipated that up to $1.1 million willbe available to support 6-10 projects. These projects will provide supportto 3-5 academically based faculty fellows within a single institution todevelop their expertise in alcohol and drug abuse, and to implement alcoholand drug abuse teaching as part of the ongoing clinical curriculum of theirspecialty. These projects will include two phases of activity: facultytraining and curriculum implementation efforts (years 1-3) and assessmentof impact of training and curriculum activities (years 4 and 5).The statutory authority for anticipated awards in section 508(b)(11), ofthe Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290aa-6(b)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose</ITAG>The purpose of this award is to develop a cadre of academically based nurseand physician faculty who will provide leadership within their clinicalspecialties/departments in alcohol and other drug abuse clinical training.It is expected that faculty fellows will develop expertise in the earlyrecognition, diagnosis, treatment and/or referral of patients with alcoholand drug abuse problems; and will incorporate alcohol and drug abuse instructionas part of their ongoing clinical training responsibilities within theirdepartments. In addition, faculty fellows at the awardee institution willwork together, under the supervision of a sponsor, to assess curriculumneeds and implement curricula in alcohol and drug abuse in their departments.Through this program, faculty fellows will develop expertise in the followingareas:andbullet; State-of-the-art prevention, screening, diagnosis, case management,and referral methods in alcohol and drug abuse;andbullet; Current alcohol and drug abuse research methodologies and findings,and the application of these findings into clinical teaching and clinicalpractice;andbullet; Application of state-of-the-art instructional materials and methodologiesto clinical teaching;andbullet; Implementing an alcohol and drug abuse curriculum as part of theongoing clinical training of faculty fellows' departments.The Faculty Development Program is not intended to support the preparationof those faculty seeking careers exclusively in research. Information regardingNIAAA and NIDA programs of support for advanced training for careers inresearch may be obtained by contacting individuals listed on pages 13 and14.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility</ITAG>Applications may be submitted by a school of medicine, a school of osteopathy,or a school of nursing.

Examples of other allowabledirect cost expenses include limited amounts for administrative support,consultants (including evaluation consultant), equipment, supplies, andtravel. All budget items must be fully justified at the level requested.All grants will be reimbursed at 8 percent of total allowable direct costsor actual indirect costs, whichever is less.Grants described in this announcement are awarded directly to eligibleschools.
