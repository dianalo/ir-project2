On the fourth day of a trial so far devoted almost entirely toreading of 1,500 pages of corruption charges against Yuri Churbanovand eight co-defendants, Judge Mikhail Marov asked Churbanov if heunderstood the charges.   ``Yes, they were understood,'' Churbanov replied, standingbefore the court. ``I admit my guilt in abuse of office but don'tadmit my guilt in receiving bribes.''   Churbanov was accused of accepting cash, wines, cognac, exoticfruits and other gifts worth more than $1 million while he wasfirst deputy interior minister under Brezhnev, the Soviet leaderfrom 1964 until his death in 1982.   Prosecutors contend the web of corruption stretched all the wayto Churbanov's boss, the late Nikolai A. Shchelokov, who was aclose friend of Brezhnev.   Court records confirmed earlier reports that Shchelokovcommitted suicide after investigators began examining his conductas interior minister.   Under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Brezhnev's years in powerare now condemned officially as ``years of stagnation'' in whichthe economy slumped, mistakes were made in foreign policy, andcorruption and cronynism prevailed.   Almost daily criticism of him appears in the Soviet press.Streets and towns have been stripped of his name, a palace builtfor him has been turned over to the public, and libraries have beentold not to carry literature produced during his rule.   Judge Marov, an army major general, said Churbanov would berequired to clarify his plea in the course of the trial.   Churbanov's lawyer, Andrei M. Makarov, told a reporterpunishment for abuse of office is 10 years in jail. If convicted oftaking bribes, the 51-year-old former official could face a firingsquad.   Makarov told a reporter he would not clarify the plea now butthe explanation would come out during the trial. It is expected tolast about two months, but Thursday was the last day foreignreporters were permitted to attend.   Khaidar Yakhyaev, former interior minister of the Central Asianrepublic of Uzbekistan, pleaded guilty Thursday to all chargesagainst him. On Wednesday, he claimed officials pressured him inprison to confess.   The other defendants, all former officials of Uzbekistan,pleaded guilty to taking bribes but not always to the extentprosecutors alleged.   In summarizing the charges, the prosecution said: ``Thedemoralization reached unheard-of levels, especially in the partyorgans of the republic of Uzbekistan.''   Mrs. Churbanov, the former Galina Brezhnev, has not attendedtrial sessions. Her husband's lawyer said she was ill and wouldtestify for her husband later.   The lesser defendants, according to the indictment, acceptedmoney and gifts from underlings in exchange for jobs, promotionsand special perquisites of many descriptions, the indictment says.</TEXT></DOC>
