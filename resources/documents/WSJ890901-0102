The new regulations would force a broad range of companies -- including coke producers, petroleum and chemical plants, and about 200,000 gasoline service stations -- to cut emissions of benzene that now pose cancer risks to people living nearby.    The government has been wrestling with the issue of benzene restrictions for 15 years. But it hasn't acted previously because of footdragging and legal action, even though the chemical is a proven cause of an incurable form of leukemia in humans. Almost half of all Americans are exposed to it from industrial sources.    The new regulations are important more broadly because they set a new EPA policy for regulating all sorts of toxic air emissions. The new policy was mandated by a 1987 court decision in which the EPA was told to pay more attention to health considerations and less to costs to industry. Even so, environmental groups claim the new approach doesn't protect enough people from unacceptable cancer risks.    Most of the cost of reducing benzene emissions -- $932 million -- would fall on half of all gasoline stations in the U.S. and on 15,000 bulk gasoline plants and 1,500 gasoline-storage terminals. The gasoline stations are those that don't already control emissions during refilling of their large underground tanks to meet city smog-control standards. The new rules wouldn't affect filling of individual automobile tanks, but that could be covered by future regulations.    The American Petroleum Institute, while pleased with the EPA's overall approach, complained that the rules would force the installation of expensive vapor recovery systems and other solutions, and that they &quot;would achieve virtually no public health benefits.&quot; The group claimed the EPA used outdated risk data.    Mark Engle, president of the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute, said the rules would require some of the oldest coke-producing plants to undergo major or total overhauls. &quot;We have to import now to meet current demand, and this will certainly further that situation,&quot; he said.    The EPA said that the 36 coke-byproduct plants affected by the rules would incur capital costs of $74 million, pushing up the price of furnace and foundry coke no more than 1%. The agency said it realized the new standards could trigger the closing of some plants that are marginal or unprofitable.    The EPA's new policy sets out to limit chemical emissions so that the greatest number of people possible face no more than a one-in-a-million risk of contracting cancer. In the case of benzene, EPA Deputy Administrator Henry Habicht said that industrial emissions of benzene will be cut 90% and that more than 99% of those living near industrial plants would face insignificant, if any, cancer risks.    Further, the EPA would seek to guarantee that any person with maximum exposure to benzene -- calculated to be 24 hours a day for 70 years -- would face no more than a one-in-10,000 chance of contracting cancer.    Environmentalists complained that's still too much risk. &quot;That's 100 times riskier than what the agency says ought to be the risk for pesticides on the food we eat,&quot; said David Hawkins, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. But he said it's too early to say whether the new standard would be challenged in court.    The EPA said its rules, half of which are final and will take effect in two years and half of which still are subject to public comment, would reduce the number of cases of leukemia from benzene among people who live near emissions sources from four a year nationwide now to one case every three years.    The rules also will require about 125 benzene storage facilities, mostly along the Gulf Coast, to spend some $660,000 to control emissions within the next two years. Proposed rules would affect chemical plants, petroleum refineries and hazardous waste treatment facilities that handle or use benzene.    Benzene is one of only seven toxic industrial emissions regulated so far by the EPA, out of some 280 known toxic air pollutants. The EPA wants to drop its current arduous chemical-by-chemical approach to cutting toxic industrial emissions. Mr. Habicht said more emissions could be cut quicker if Congress adopts President Bush's clean-air proposals, which would focus on requiring control technologies for broad ranges of industries rather than examining chemicals one at a time. If a new clean-air law is passed, the EPA's policy for benzene would be overtaken.    The EPA's industrial-emissions rules address only 20% of the nation's benzene problem. Almost 80% of benzene emissions are blamed on emissions from automobile tanks and tailpipes. There already are separate regulations to protect workers exposed to benzene. </TEXT></DOC>
