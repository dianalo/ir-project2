Heads of large Miami-area hospitals get more than $200,000 a year; raises last year averaged about 11%, says the South Florida Hospital Association. With half of Dade County hospitals in the red in 1986, the group says, the jobs demand &quot;great creativity&quot; and spur fierce competition to cut costs. Warren Surveys, Rockford, Ill., finds the average salary of the heads of 200 Health Maintenance Organizations in January was $97,033, up 86% from 1981.    The gap between the pay of health-care executives and those in general industry has narrowed to 11% from 36% in 1980, says Hay Group, consultants, and the use of incentives has &quot;exploded,&quot; to 70% of those surveyed from 20%. Mergers have helped force health-care groups to up the ante for more &quot;business savvy,&quot; Hay says.    Pay raises are used to fight turnover; 44 of the 66 Miami-area hospitals changed administrators since 1984; the Fort Lauderdale hospital changed five times.    EMPLOYER SUBSIDIES spread for workers' use of public transit.    More firms pay all or part of employee bus or subway costs, though all but $15 monthly of such aid is a taxable worker benefit; parking fees aren't taxed. CACI Inc., Rosslyn, Va., consultants, gives employees up to $100 a month in commuting help. Seahawk Management, Houston, pays bus-ride costs; Humana Inc., the Louisville health-care company, offers $15 a month of free bus passes; and San Antonio's Frost Bank gives a 50% bus-fare discount.    Combined Insurance, Chicago, sells $46 monthly transit passes for $33 to 700 workers. Varian Associates, a Palo Alto, Calif., electronics firm, pays 25% of transit tickets to unclog its parking lot. The Washington, D.C., Metro system says 96 firms convey passes to employees, up from 60 in 1983.    AIDS PROTECTION splits doctors and hospital workers.    Some unions of nurses, technicians and other workers say emergency federal regulations are needed to fight hazards from blood-borne diseases, such as accidental needle pricks. But doctors and hospital chiefs applaud the Labor Department's decision to emphasize enforcement of existing general workplace rules rather than quickly make new ones. Such new requirements mightn't work and could be &quot;disproportionate&quot; to a small problem, the American Medical Association says.    A piqued AFSCME spokesman says doctors don't care; he charges that doctors' only patient contact is a daily chat and &quot;sending the bill.&quot; But Lonnie Bristow, an AMA trustee, says doctors do care about workers, and &quot;we probably have more exposure to blood,&quot; especially during surgery.    AFSCME says it will push for tough state laws and will &quot;put {the Labor Department's} feet to the fire&quot; on enforcing current standards.    SIX MONTHS' LEAVE for parents of newborn children was won by the Ladies' Garment Workers Union in a new contract with New York undergarment firms. A recent state survey showed that of New York employers with 100 or fewer workers, 15% gave eight weeks' or more parental leave to mothers, 8% to fathers.    &quot;UNLADYLIKE LANGUAGE&quot; didn't justify firing the woman bartender at a Winchester, Va., cabaret, a federal judge ruled. Men often used foul language there, and her remarks reacted to sexual harassment and profanity by a supervisor, the court said, ordering the nightclub to rehire the woman and pay her $21,612 in back wages.    COUGH UP OVERTIME PAY, two unions demand in lawsuits on behalf of Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration employees. They seek cash due them since 1981.    EXECUTIVES IN BRAZIL get 100% pay increases to offset inflation, but their salaries drop in U.S. dollars, killing Americans' zeal for duty there, says Boyden International, an executive search firm. A typical finance director's monthly pay rose to 190,000 devalued Cruzados in the first half of this year but fell $1,280, or 22%.    STARTING SALARIES for lawyers, already high, zoom in 1987.    After only modest rises in recent years, the average beginning pay for new associates soared more than 20% this year to $33,000, a survey of 601 law firms by the ABA Journal shows. As law-school enrollments level off and firms charge clients much stiffer fees, they bid high for top-quality graduates to justify those fees. The highest big-city sums may reach $72,000, after last year's big increase to $65,000 by New York's Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore.    That offer had a &quot;ripple effect&quot; on other law firms, says Laurence Bodine, the Journal editor. Two law-school grads, a married couple, are taking jobs at separate New York firms; their combined pay: $130,000.    The average lawyer's net worth is over half a million dollars, another survey of about 500 ABA Journal subscribers revealed.    THE CHECKOFF: Oregon unemployment office employees learn their job by playing &quot;Claims Game,&quot; a cross between Trivial Pursuit and Monopoly. . . . Executive job seekers especially balk at leaving Columbus, Ohio; Minneapolis; and Houston, in that order, reports James Challenger, a Chicago placement man. </TEXT></DOC>
