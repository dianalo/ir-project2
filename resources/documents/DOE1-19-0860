Ga-67 citrate was first used in the assessmentof patients with malignant testicular tumors in 1973. Following threeyears of study that supported the observation of the gallium-avid natureof seminoma, gallium scans became routine in the initial staging assessmentand were used also when recurrence was suspected. From 1977 through 1982,72 patients with biopsy-proven seminoma testis were assessed initiallyfor extent of disease by Ga-67 scanning. Comparison with intravenouspyelography and bipedal lymphography was possible for accuracy of tumorassessment. The scan sensitivity was 83%, and the specificity was 95%.During the same period, gallium was studied in nonseminomatous testiculartumors but the results were disappointing and its use was discontinued.The gallium-avid nature of seminoma testis may be useful in determiningthe extent of disease.</TEXT></DOC>
