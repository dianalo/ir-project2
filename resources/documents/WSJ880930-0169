The stumbling block apparently was a proposal by United to link the order to contract concessions from its pilots, who refused to go along.    The attempted transaction shows how much the UAL Corp. unit is eager to modernize and bolster its aging fleet, but raises questions about the carrier's ability to finance such purchases. It also was significant for Airbus, the European aircraft consortium, because it showed United's apparent willingness to buy Airbus jets. It is possible United will try to revive the purchase in some other form.    The industry sources said United's plan to buy the A-320s and possibly other makers' planes ended after the pilots didn't accept a cost-saving contract offer from the carrier. There was speculation United also had been prepared to place another order with Seattle-based Boeing Co., possibly for more of its 757 jets.    United wouldn't comment, except to confirm that it talked with both Airbus and New York-based Pan Am Corp., parent of Pan American World Airways. The industry sources said the talks centered on United's taking over Pan Am's deal with Airbus for 16 firm orders for the A-320 and 34 options. The sources said United was prepared to place orders or options for another 50 A-320s.    While the catalog price of $35 million for the A-320 indicates a total potential price of $3.5 billion in the United effort, airlines typically pay less than the catalog price. The A-320, a state-of-the-art aircraft that seats 150, first went into service this year in Europe.    Frederick C. Dubinsky, chairman of the United unit of the Air Line Pilots Association, confirmed that the company had &quot;some conversations&quot; about linking an A-320 purchase to a contract with the 6,000-member union. &quot;They have suggested to us that, in order to finance equipment purchases in the future, they will have to have reduced pilot costs,&quot; he said.    Mr. Dubinsky said the union rejects that position. &quot;They (management) have to come to grips with the fact that the United pilots intend to get a progressive agreement,&quot; he said. He added that United &quot;shouldn't wait for the tooth fairy, because the tooth fairy isn't coming.&quot;    United and the pilots union have been negotiating since last spring on a contract to replace one that became amendable April 1. While the airline is attempting to get savings with work-rule changes, the pilots have vowed not to sign a concessionary agreement.    Pat Friend, head of the Association of Flight Attendants union at United, said the airline told the attendants it plans to buy more airplanes. In May, United ordered 30 Boeing 757-200 jet aircraft for more than $1.3 billion and took options on another 30.    United needs to replace aircraft and add new ones. The average age of its planes is more than 11.5 years. Its load factor, or the percentage of available seats occupied, is one of the highest in the industry, at 77.7% last month.    United's talks with Airbus represent a victory of sorts for the consortium, because United doesn't have any Airbus planes in its fleet of 390 aircraft. &quot;We feel comfortable that the next time they (United) go to kick tires and look for airplanes to buy, we have a good, fair shot with them,&quot; an Airbus spokesman said.    The A-320 transaction by United would have given Pan Am badly needed cash in return for giving up its spot in line for the new planes. The industry sources said United was prepared to pay Pan Am more than $100 million for the right to take over the orders.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, UAL shares closed at $94.75, up $2.125, as the market rose broadly. </TEXT></DOC>
