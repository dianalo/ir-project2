President Alfredo Cristiani accused Nicaragua's Sandinistas ofeither supplying the weapons or parts and technical skill for theirconstruction to the rebels.   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), anumbrella organization of guerrilla groups, had announced inFebruary it was suspending the use of homemade mortars in populatedareas because their inaccuracy caused civilian casualties.   Cristiani told a news conference the attack was ``an attempt bythe FMLN to give the impression it is strong.   ``But they (the rebels) have only the capacity to stageterrorist actions.''   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saideight shells struck the grounds of the Armed Forces Social Clubadjacent to the ministry compound but no one was wounded there.   Authorities said the other shells exploded in adjoining civilianneighborhoods.   Ponce reported 30 unfired shells were found on two trucks fromwhich the other shells had been launched. The trucks were in ashopping mall about 300 yards from the military compound.   The shells on one truck were covered with garlands of paperflowers, the kind used in ceremonies marking the Day of the Deadholiday on Nov. 2. Those on the other truck were covered with boxespainted as speakers for a musical band.   Ponce called the shelling ``indiscriminate terrorism,'' and alsoaccused Nicaragua's leftist government of providing the weapons forthe rebels.   ``The FMLN lies when it talks about peace while at the same timewaging war,'' Ponce said, referring to recent efforts to negotiatean end to the decade-old civil war.   Representatives of Cristiani's rightist government and the FMLNhave met twice since September, but they are far apart on terms fora cease-fire and have only agreed to continue the talks.   Two shells exploded at a gasoline station about 800 yards away,killing Ernesto Vasquez, 72, as he pumped gas. The blasts woundedtwo attendants.   ``I felt I was on a battlefield,'' said Francisco Morales, 27, amechanic, about 15 minutes after the attack.   ``This is very bad,'' said Morales, who was shaken by thedeafening blasts and the carnage. ``They (the guerrillas) don't letthe humble people work, and we have to work.''   The gas station was heavily damaged, but there was no fire.   Another bomb fell at a nearby fried chicken restaurant, slightlywounding a boy and causing extensive damage.   Two mortar shells fell at the entrance to the military compound,and three landed beyond the compound, on a sidewalk bordering aparking lot next to the National Baseball Stadium. At least onesoldier and one civilian were wounded by those blasts, witnessessaid.   Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres, chief of the armed forces presscommittee, said no bombs fell inside the ministry compound.   A soldier on duty at the gate said two bombs fell inside thecompound, but this could not be confirmed. Witnesses said they sawone injured soldier being evacuated from the compound.   The rebels staged a similar attack on Dec. 23, killing threepeople and wounding 38. Only one of those casualties was a soldier.   The rebels issued a communique Feb. 28 announcing they wouldsuspend such attacks because of ``faults and deficiencies'' thatwere causing ``high risk to the civilian population, without us atany time having intended to harm innocent civilians.''   According to human rights organizations, most of the more than70,000 people killed in El Salvador's civil war have been civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
