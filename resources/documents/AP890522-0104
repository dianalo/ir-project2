Secord was released on his own recognizance after beingarraigned before U.S. District Court Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson.   Prosecutors and defense attorneys said they will discuss whetherto combine the latest set of charges with an earlier indictment ofSecord. They will report back to the court May 31.   Robinson said, meanwhile, that he expects the trials of Secordand John Poindexter, once presidential national security adviser,to begin simultaneously. The judge said it would be impossible forhim to handle both Iran-Contra cases, which probably will be triedthis fall. Robinson is handling pre-trial proceedings in thePoindexter case.   Poindexter; Secord; Secord's business partner, Albert Hakim, andOliver North were charged in 1988 with illegally diverting morethan $14 million in Iranian arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguanrebels.   Prosecutor Reid Weingarten said the office of independentcounsel Lawrence Walsh has ``every intention'' of prosecuting Hakimafter Secord's trail.   The latest indictment against Secord accuses him of obstructingthe congressional Iran-Contra investigation in 1987, perjury andmaking false statements. The nine counts were unsealed May 11 afterNorth's trial ended.   Secord lawyer Thomas Green said he might have to withdraw fromthe case because ``I was privy to and was a party to discussionswith Congress'' in connection with Secord's 1987 congressionaltestimony. Therefore, Green said, he might be called as a witnessat the trial.   Green said he would, ``under those circumstances,'' withdrawfrom the case in favor of a partner in his law firm, James E.Sharp, who stood next to Secord as he was arraigned.   Weingarten said that ``usually the entire firm is dismissed'' asthe attorney for a defendant when one of the firm's lawyers becomesa witness in the case. Weingarten said ``we must explore'' whetheranyone in the firm of Sharp, Green andamp; Lankford should representSecord.   Secord is accused of lying when he told Congress that he wasn'ttaking profits from his network of foreign corporations and Swissbank accounts, part of an operation that became known as theEnterprise. In fact, said the federal grand jury indictment, Secordused a former Internal Revenue Service lawyer ``on a continuousbasis to manage over a million dollars of profits allocated to thedefendant, Richard V. Secord.''   He also was accused of lying when he testified that his onlyfinancial gain from the arms sales to Iran and the Contras was his$6,000-a-month salary; that $500,000 from the Enterprise funneledto one of his companies was a loan, and that he was unaware anymoney from the Enterprise benefited North.   North was convicted earlier this month of three criminal chargesin the Iran-Contra affair, including illegally accepting a $13,800home security system from Secord. In addition, the governmentalleges, Secord and Hakim arranged to set aside $200,000 as a deathbenefit for the education of North's children.   North called on Secord to secretly run weapons to the Contrasduring a congressional cutoff in military aid to the rebel forceand to assist in the Reagan administration's secret arms sales toIran.</TEXT></DOC>
