For years, pay-for-performance has been a buzz word in the executive suite. As corporations have moved to pare fixed costs, ever larger percentages of management compensation have come as bonuses and other incentive awards rather than base pay. Now the notion is spreading to the factory and clerical floors. Du Pont Co., in one of the broadest steps, ultimately will pay the 20,000 workers in its fibers business 6% less than counterparts elsewhere in the company. But they'll be eligible for bonuses that could put them as much as 12% ahead.    A similar plan at Burlington Northern caps the pay of the railroad's 3,000 workers but opens them all up for bonuses tied to individual and corporate performance. A lower-level employee in an average year might get a 4% increase; a top performer might get 10%. BellSouth Corp. links non-management bonuses to profit goals and customer-service objectives. Borg-Warner Corp. and Raychem Corp. tether payments to profitability.    Microsoft Corp. ties bonuses to performance, not profit: &quot;Profitability has always been extremely high.&quot;    GETTING FIRED: It's different for women than men.    Because women receiving outplacement counseling after being ousted from their jobs are typically younger and lower down the executive ladder than men, they usually approach the job search &quot;in a better, more positive frame of mind.&quot; So concludes a report for the Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms by the Daniel Yankelovich Group, a research firm.    Female executives also are more flexible than males. The men want to find positions that match what they had been doing before. Women, by contrast, are more willing to accept the &quot;new and different,&quot; perhaps because they realize their options are limited, the report observes. But positive attitude and flexibility don't necessarily beat a path to success. Women don't find jobs any faster than men.    PUBLIC SCHOOLS are business's business, executives argue.    &quot;I don't think business has a choice,&quot; asserts Frederic Salerno, chief executive of New York Telephone Co. &quot;If business takes a hands-off attitude, it isn't going to be fixed.&quot; The company helps with school management. Exxon Corp. focuses on math instruction in kindergarten through third grades. &quot;If you don't get them by the age of eight or nine, you may already have cast the die,&quot; declares Arnold Shore, executive director of the Exxon Education Foundation.    Capital Cities/ABC Inc. broadens its literacy campaign to include youth as well as adults. &quot;This is the work force of tomorrow,&quot; says John Harr, a vice president. And tomorrow's consumers. Companies are &quot;increasingly putting out sophisticated products and finding their customers can't read them,&quot; he explains. Trinova Corp., for its part, contributes to public schools.    Exxon says shareholders rarely complain that contributions to education are hurting the bottom line.    EVER THE OPTIMISTS, 17% of the M.B.A. students at Duke's Fuqua School are more interested in going into investment banking now than they were before last October's crash. This even though more than half of them confess &quot;somewhat lower confidence&quot; they'll be able to find a job.    WHAT CRASH? Two-thirds of the chief financial officers surveyed by A. Foster Higgins andamp; Co. insist the market collapse hasn't had any &quot;important&quot; influence on pension-fund strategies. Even among those that see the crash as important, &quot;almost half are doing nothing about it,&quot; says the consultant, explaining &quot;companies take a long view.&quot;    COSTS PER HIRE are dropping. The Employment Management Association says the average employer last year spent $5,856 to hire a professional or managerial employee, down 23% from 1982. Companies save by doing their own searching and doing it closer to home to cut relocation costs.    PENSIONERS FARE WELL. More than 60% of the retirees receiving pensions from former employers and Social Security say their income is &quot;adequate&quot; for their needs, finds a survey by consultant Retirement Advisors. It better be. Only 2% of them get any financial help from families.    WHO'S WORRIED? Not us. Most executives think their jobs are secure.    Despite continuing corporate takeovers and retrenchments, 78% of the middle and senior executives surveyed by Decisions Center, a research firm, say it's &quot;very unlikely&quot; they'll lose their current positions through 1989. A further 16% say it's &quot;somewhat unlikely.&quot; Only a slim 6% believe their posts are at risk.    And why should they fret? A separate study by consultant Towers Perrin shows 41% of the nation's top 100 industrial companies now offer golden parachutes to protect at least some executives from hostile takeovers. That's double the number of 1985.    Besides, new jobs usually pay 20% more, says the National Association of Corporate and Professional Recruiters.    THE CHECKOFF: When tapping a &quot;network&quot; in search of work, never come out and ask for a job, cautions consultant Costello, Erdlen andamp; Co. You're supposed to say only you want advice and leads. . . . Hire a grouch? Penn State psychologist Leila Worth says a good mood distracts you from thinking problems through. </TEXT></DOC>
