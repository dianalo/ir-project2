Macleod </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> New York  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The real Peter Rabbit, bought for the &quot;exorbitant sum&quot; of four shillings, six pence at a London market, was a lazy sort. He spent most days resting on a quilt in Beatrix Potter's studio. But with the publication in 1901 of Ms. Potter's first children's book, &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit,&quot; he was immortalized as the naughty bunny who slipped into old Mr. McGregor's garden for a bite and almost wound up as rabbit pie.    Ms. Potter, in turn, found fame as &quot;the Peter Rabbit lady.&quot; But as a comprehensive exhibit of her work now at the Pierpont Morgan Library clearly shows, the creator of such enduring characters as Squirrel Nutkin, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and Jemima Puddle-Duck had much more than cute cottontails on her mind.    The 300-plus drawings, watercolors, letters, books and memorabilia in &quot;Beatrix Potter: Artist and Storyteller&quot; (up through Aug. 21) trace a full and diverse life: her childhood in Victorian England, her productive middle years as a Christmas-card designer and children's-book writer and illustrator, and her late years as a Lake District farmer and conservationist.    From the beginning, Ms. Potter loved drawing and painting the animals she and her younger brother kept in the third-floor schoolroom of their London home: frogs, lizards, snakes, hedgehogs, squirrels, bats -- and her favorites, rabbits and mice. She rarely drew humans, but covered sheet after sheet of paper with meticulously rendered animal claws, paws, heads and tails. Some of these can be seen at the outset of the show, which is arranged chronologically. And Ms. Potter wasn't squeamish: Dead animals were routinely skinned and boiled or stuffed for study.    Ms. Potter also carefully copied pictures from books and participated in family discussions about art (her father was a talented photographer and a friend of the painter John Everett Millais). She visited galleries and museums. In particular, she spent many hours drawing the insect displays at London's Natural History Museum. Her long-limbed spiders, black beetles and brightly colored butterflies are so accurate they wouldn't look out of place in a high-school science text.    Ms. Potter found many other subjects for her work -- all manner of flora, fauna, fossils and fungi -- while summering at her family's wooded estate in the Scottish highlands. She produced more than 300 drawings of fungi in their natural settings. A pair of pretty red-topped mushrooms surrounded by a fern, mosses and lichen is one such work in the show.    Ms. Potter was, in fact, one of the first people to recognize the close relationship between certain trees and fungi, foreshadowing later scientific discoveries. But fortunately for us, this serious young woman allowed herself to draw purely for fun sometimes, mostly whimsical sketches of rabbits and mice. An adorable watercolor done when she was just nine, for example, shows bunnies sledding and skating, all bundled up in coats, hats and scarves.    Rabbit pictures done many years later, when Ms. Potter was 24, launched her career as a Christmas-card designer and book illustrator. A delightful series of six paintings from the same period entitled &quot;The Rabbits' Christmas Party&quot; shows that Ms. Potter already had found a distinctive style of her own.    When she became a commercial success, Ms. Potter still maintained ties with old friends, particularly the family of her former governess, Annie Moore. On holiday in Scotland in 1893 she wrote a long illustrated letter to the eldest Moore child that begins: &quot;My dear Noel, I don't know what to write to you, so I shall tell you a story about four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter . . .&quot;    So what began as a letter to a five-year-old wound up, with some alterations and additions, as &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit,&quot; one of the greatest children's books ever written. Almost a century later, the letter remains in excellent condition, though its whereabouts were unknown for 40 years.    The book, meanwhile, has sold 65 million copies in 15 languages. The Morgan Library exhibit includes 11 such editions, with our hero's name variously translated as &quot;Pierre Lapin&quot; (French) &quot;Sagan Um Petur Kaninu&quot; (Icelandic), and &quot;Hanes Pwtan Y Gwningen&quot; (Welsh). (There's no mention of the recent furor in Britain over the appearance of an &quot;updated&quot; &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; featuring simplified language and photographs of animal puppets.)    &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; became the first in a series of &quot;little books&quot; that followed the original Potter formula: They are written in simple, direct language, are inexpensive, and fit easily into small hands. As Ms. Potter wrote to one of the Moore children: &quot;She would rather make 2 or 3 little books costing 1 {shilling} each than one big book costing 6 {shillings} because she thinks little rabbits cannot afford to spend 6 shillings on one book and could never buy it.&quot;    In all, Ms. Potter wrote and illustrated 23 &quot;little books,&quot; none of which has ever been out of print. Her favorite was &quot;The Tailor of Gloucester,&quot; about mice who help a poor old tailor who has fallen ill finish an elaborate waistcoat. The tale, set &quot;in the time of swords and periwigs,&quot; was originally written for Noel's sister Freda. All 22 watercolor drawings for the story can now be seen for the first time in the U.S.    Ms. Potter spent her twilight years at her Lake District farm tending to her solicitor husband, breeding sheep, and amassing large tracts of land. When she died in 1943 at the age of 77 she bequeathed 4,000 acres to Britain's National Trust.    &quot;Beatrix Potter: Artist and Storyteller,&quot; which opened at London's Tate Gallery last year, was organized by the National Trust and sponsored by Ford Motor Co. It is accompanied by a 223-page catalog, &quot;Beatrix Potter 1866-1943: The Artist and Her World&quot; (F. Warne andamp; Co./ Viking Penguin, $19.95), and a 30-minute slide show narrated by Julie Andrews, &quot;The Tale of Beatrix Potter&quot; (shown Tuesdays-Saturdays at 12:15 p.m. and Sundays at 1:15 p.m.). </TEXT></DOC>
