Although full-scalefighting did not begin until nine months later, the opening days ofSeptember 1939 are not forgotten by those who lived through them.   The Associated Press asked four of its present and formercorrespondents for their memories of the war's first days.</TEXT><TEXT>   CLAUDE CASPAR-JORDAN, Paris, who was vacationing on the FrenchRiviera when a telegram summoned him to his cavalry unit:   Tension grew minute by minute over the next days, until theafternoon of Sept. 3, when I was with other military personnel in acafe near our barracks in Pontoise, outside Paris.   A popular singer was crooning on the radio when the broadcast wasinterrupted for the official announcement of the state of war byPremier Edouard Daladier.   His voice sounded strangled. We listened in a heavy silence,staring at each other.   In the following days, men arrived at the barracks. We startedgetting our arms: revolvers, carbines, light machine guns, grenades,one or two mortars, ammunition.   Requisitioned cars, vans and trucks arrived driven by theirowners or chauffeurs. To their surprise, they were told they, too,were being mobilized. They frantically phoned relatives who wereexpecting them back.   On Sept. 9, the regiment left town for the eastern front. Therehad been no time to camouflage the vehicles. They included a cheesedelivery van featuring ``La vache qui rit,'' the laughing cow,painted in vivid colors on its sides.   My captain was silent, then suddenly said in a low voice, ``Weare going to the slaughter.''</TEXT><TEXT>   GRAHAM HEATHCOTE, London, who was walking down Whitehall with hismother when Britain declared war on Germany:   We were opposite the Cenotaph commemorating the dead of World WarI when Big Ben chimed 11 times.   For about 20 minutes we did not know we were again at war withGermany. Then we heard an air raid siren wail.   A policeman shouted at us to go to a shelter, but we walked ontoward Victoria train station and, soon after, the siren sounded anall-clear. My mother talked to me about the German Zeppelins whichcame to bomb her in the Great War.   When we got home to our village in Kent, my father said gloomily:``Now we're for it.''   At teatime the radio replayed Prime Minister NevilleChamberlain's broadcast announcing that Britain and Germany were atwar. He said, ``... My long struggle to win peace has failed. .. .It is evil things that we shall be fighting against.''   Later we learned that the first siren of the war was a falsealarm, triggered by an unidentified light plane in which a Frenchdiplomat was crossing the English Channel.</TEXT><TEXT>   PHILIPPE NEURAY, Brussels, who was vacationing with his parentsand relatives in Saint Quay-Portrieux, a seaside resort in Brittany:   A lasting image I have is of all the town's little fishing boatssuddenly returning to port after the signal station atop a clifffired its cannon to announce that war had broken out.   Tension had been growing among the adults in my family and in thevillage itself during the weeks leading up to Sept. 1. One of myFrench uncles had already been drafted.   The quiet atmosphere of Saint Quay-Portrieux's small railroadstation was usually disturbed only a few times a day, and then onlybriefly, by the arrival of a wobbling steam train. But on Sept. 1 itwas packed with Frenchmen from the area who were being mobilized.</TEXT><TEXT>   RUDOLF E. JOSTEN, Berlin, who was an AP reporter in the Germancapital when Hitler announced the war in a broadcast over radio andpublic address systems:   There was an unending string of official announcements: listeningto foreign radios was an offense punishable by eight years'imprisonment; passing on their news was punishable by death. Privatecars and taxis were seized; there was no more gas for most others;food ration coupons had already been issued.   In the afternoon sirens sounded for what was said to be an airraid drill. Later, stormtroopers patrolled the streets shouting atevery lit window. Air Marshal Goering, seeking to reassure thepeople, said: ``If any enemy plane ever reaches Berlin, I willchange my name to Meyer,'' a remark that fueled bitter jokes whenBerlin was flattened by Allied bombs a few years later.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Friday, Sept. 1</NOTE></DOC>
