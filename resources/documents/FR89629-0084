Records schedulesidentify records of sufficient value to warrant preservation in the NationalArchives of the United States. Schedules also authorize agencies aftera specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal,research, or other value. Notice is published for records schedules that(1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized for disposal,or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal.NARA invites public comments on such schedules, as required by 44 U.S.C.3303a(a).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Requests for copies must be received in writing on or beforeAugust 14, 1989.

Requestersmust cite the control number assigned to each schedule when requestinga copy. The control number appears in parentheses immediately after thename of the requesting agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Each year U.S. Government agenciescreate billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media.In order to control this accumulation, agency records managers preparerecords schedules specifying when the agency no longer needs the recordsand what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensiveand cover all the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions.These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual transfer to theNational Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposalof all other records. Most schedules, however, cover records of only oneoffice or program or a few series of records, and many are updates of previouslyapproved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designatedfor permanent retention.Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the UnitedStates. This approval is granted after a thorough study of the recordsthat takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin,the rights and interests of the Government and of private persons directlyaffected by the Government's activities, and historical or other value.This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisionsrequesting disposition authority, includes the control number assignedto each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal.The records schedule contains additional information about the recordsand their disposition. Further information about the disposition processwill be furnished to each requester. <ITAG tagnum="84">Schedules Pending</ITAG>1. Defense Contract Audit Agency (N1-372-89-1).
