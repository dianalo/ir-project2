Military leaders warned that former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''Honasan, who escaped with 14 prison guards and who remains apopular figure in the armed forces, might try to topple thegovernment again.   ``If he pursues his attempts to change the government and leadthe AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines), then we will have aproblem,'' military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said Saturday.``We are asking the support of the citizens to help us. Weanticipate they (the rebels) will go on with consolidation andpropaganda and they will again try to divide the AFP.''   Honasan, 39, escaped from a prison ship before dawn Saturdaywith 14 elite navy personnel who were supposed to be guarding him.He had been confined there since his arrest Dec. 9 for the Aug. 28attempted coup, which left at least 53 people dead and hundredswounded.   His daring escape was a blow to the prestige of the armedforces, already facing threats from communist and Moslem rebels.   President Corazon Aquino hurried back to Manila Saturday afterthe escape, interrupting an Easter holiday in northern Luzon foremergency meetings and a nationally televised address.   ``I have instructed the chief of staff to issue a warning inunmistakable terms to all military personnel that any assistancegiven to the renegades will be dealt with promptly and severelywith the full force of the law,'' she said in the address.   Mrs. Aquino, who had refused to grant amnesty to Honasan,appealed to the public for help in tracking him down. She said hefled to avoid court-martial for mutiny and sedition, arson, murderand conduct unbecoming an officer. His escape, she added, ``istantamount to an admission of his guilt.''   Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez hinted the government wouldshut down news organizations if it felt their reports in any wayhelped the rebels' cause. Honasan had given several interviews tolocal and foreign media before his arrest in a Manila suburb.   Florendo said Honasan fled from the ``Andres Bonifacio'' prisonvessel with a navy lieutenant and 13 enlisted men. The ship wasanchored in Manila Bay about 500 yards from navy headquarters.   They escaped in dinghies that had been sent to the ship toincrease security after reports that Honasan would try to escape.Florendo said loyal guards fired on the fleeing boats butapparently missed.   Mrs. Aquino said the prison ship's captain had been arrested andhe and members of his crew would face court-martial for negligence.   Military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theformer colonel was so popular that he had become the dominantfigure aboard the vessel which was supposed to be his prison. Heremains widely respected in the 160,000-member armed forces eventhough he has officially been dismissed from the military.   Meanwhile, the government rushed to strengthen security in andaround the capital Saturday. Trucks and bulldozers blockedentrances to military camps in Manila, and mobile checkpoints wereset up on roads leading north.   Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos said the military was ``takingevery possible action to bring him (Honasan) back and to minimizeor neutralize any further demage that he can make.''   Despite the crisis, presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno saidMrs. Aquino would go ahead with a visit to China, scheduled tobegin April 14.   Honasan, a former defense ministry chief of security, played akey role in the Feb. 22, 1986, civilian-military uprising thattoppled President Ferdinand Marcos and brought Mrs. Aquino topower. But he later accused Mrs. Aquino of weak and ineptleadership in the face of the communist insurgency.   In August, Honasan led 2,000 men in a coup on the presidentialpalace and seized several media and military installations in thecapital. But they were driven off by pro-Aquino forces.   It was the most serious of six major plots to unseat Mrs.Aquino. Honasan escaped and went into hiding before his arrest fourmonths later. The military says 11 officers and 90 enlisted meninvolved in the coup attempt remain at large.   Mrs. Aquino said Saturday that Honasan had carried out his coupattempt while facing investigation into misappropriation ofmilitary equipment. She also said he wanted to avoid a combatcommand.</TEXT></DOC>
