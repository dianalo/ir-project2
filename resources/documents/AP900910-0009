GorbachevSunday at the close of their summit.   ``With regard to Iraq's invasion and continued militaryoccupation of Kuwait, President Bush and President Gorbachev issuethe following joint statement:   ``We are united in the belief that Iraq's aggression must not betolerated. No peaceful international order is possible if largerstates can devour their smaller neighbors.   ``We reaffirm the joint statement of our foreign ministers ofAug. 3, 1990, and our support for United Nations Security CouncilResolutions 660, 661, 662, 664 and 665.   ``Today, we once again call upon the government of Iraq towithdraw unconditionally from Kuwait, to allow the restoration ofKuwait's legitimate government, and to free all hostages now heldin Iraq and Kuwait.   ``Nothing short of the complete implementation of the UnitedNations Security Council resolutions is acceptable.   ``Nothing short of a return to the pre-August 2 status of Kuwaitcan end Iraq's isolation.   ``We call upon the entire world community to adhere to thesanctions mandated by the United Nations, and we pledge to work,individually and in concert, to insure full compliance with thesanctions. At the same time, the United States and the Soviet Unionrecognize that U.N. Security Council Resolution 661 permits, inhumanitarian circumstances, the importation into Iraq and Kuwait offood. The Sanctions Committee will make recommendations to theSecurity Council on what would constitute humanitariancircumstances. The United States and the Soviet Union further agreethat any such imports must be strictly monitored by the appropriateinternational agencies to ensure that food reaches only those forwhom it is intended, with special priority being given to meetingthe needs of children.   ``Our preference is to resolve the crisis peacefully, and wewill be united against Iraq's aggression as long as the crisisexists. However, we are determined to see this aggression end, andif the current steps fail to end it, we are prepared to consideradditional ones consistent with the U.N. charter. We mustdemonstrate beyond any doubt that aggression cannot and will notpay.   ``As soon as the objectives mandated by the U.N. SecurityCouncil resolutions mentioned above have been achieved, and we havedemonstrated that aggression does not pay, the presidents directtheir foreign ministers to work with countries in the region andoutside it to develop regional security structures and measures topromote peace and stability. It is essential to work actively toresolve all remaining conflicts in the Middle East and PersianGulf. Both sides will continue to consult each other and initiatemeasures to pursue these broader objectives at the proper time.''</TEXT></DOC>
