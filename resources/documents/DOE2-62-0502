<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-62-0502 </DOCNO><TEXT>Very shallow p/sup +/-n GaAs homojunction solar cells are prepared onboth bulk and deposited thin film materials by utilizing a solid statediffusion process, and investigated by optical and electron beam inducedcurrent techniques (OBIC and EBIC respectively). Some specimens are alsoanalyzed by the scanning transmission technique (STEBIC). A spatiallyresolved spectral scanning apparatus is used in the OBIC experiments.Local (50-80 {mu}m) spectral responses are worked out in order to achievea quantitative estimate of the relevant cell parameters, such as junctiondepth and minority carrier diffusion length. Data are reported for twoshallow homojunctions quite homogeneous in depth. A large spreading ofthe minority carrier diffusion length values (L/sub p/ = 0.02-0.8 {mu}m)results from the analysis of bulk devices; higher and more homogeneousvalues are obtained on thin films (L/sub p/ = 1.2-2.3 {mu}m). Very smallregions ({le}1 {mu}m) of electrical recombination are detected by EBICand STEM-STEBIC and compared with their morphologies. The electricallyactive defects observed in epitaxial films are not generally correlatedto dislocations or stacking faults; they seem rather due to local off-stoichiometryor not-resolved impurity clusters. Moreover, the density of these defectsin epitaxial films is lower than in bulk specimens. This fact can explainthe superior quality of the shallow junctions in epitaxially grown layersin comparison with the commercial single crystal ones. Homogeneity andhigh doping level of diffused layers prove that this solid state diffusionprocess is suitable for realizing high efficiency solar cells.</TEXT></DOC>
