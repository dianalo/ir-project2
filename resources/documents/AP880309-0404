(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal regulators declined Wednesday torenew their previous pledge not to take regulatory action againstthe thrift unit of troubled Financial Corp. of America.   The move came as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, whichoversees the thrift industry, sought to reassure nervous WallStreet firms who have lent more than $12 billion to AmericanSavings andamp; Loan Association of Stockton, Calif., Irvine-based FCA'sthrift unit.   The bank board declined to issue a new letter pledging not totake regulatory action against FCA. Regulators have issued such``comfort letters'' to FCA since late 1984, when the company wasswamped by heavy losses and fell below regulatory capitalrequirements.   At the end of 1987, the company for the first time posted anegative net worth _ the difference between assets and liabilities.   FCA has tried unsuccessfully to work out the problems by itselfbut has been hindered by persistent problems with bad loans. FCAadded $551.2 million to its loan-loss provisions last year,bringing the total since September 1984 to $1.7 billion.   The bank board has tried unsuccessfully for nearly a year tofind another institution willing to take over all or part of FCA onterms that wouldn't be excessively costly to the Federal Savings andamp;Loan Insurance Corp., the bank board unit that insures customerdeposits up to $100,000 each.   Because of its size, a failure by FCA would cause seriousproblems for FSLIC.   FCA, with $33.9 billion in assets at year-end, is the nation'ssecond-largest thrift holding company after Los Angeles-based H.F.Ahmanson andamp; Co.   In its effort to reassure Wall Street, the bank board said in aneight-page resolution Wednesday that it would use its ``bestefforts'' to insure that the market for reverse repurchaseagreements, or repos, isn't disrupted if American Savings defaultson its obligations, or if regulators must take any action such asplacing the institution under receivership.   American Savings has about $12.6 billion in repos outstanding.   Repos are financing instruments in which a lender buys asecurity and agrees to resell it to the original seller when itreaches maturity. Repos usually mature in 30 days or less and thecollateral generally is in the form of mortgage-backed securitiesheld by the borrowing thrift.   FCA's current comfort letter expires March 31.   Asked if the bank board was considering renewing that letter orissuing a new one, spokesman Karl Hoyle said, ``No. We feel today'sresolution deals with that question.''   Some industry leaders have argued that past comfort letters hadunduly restricted the bank board's options in dealing with FCA'sproblems.   While Wednesday's resolution didn't say the bank board wouldtake any action against American Savings, it did say it issued theresolution because of ``the potential disruption to the markets insuch repos that could arise as a result of a receivership,conservatorship or similar proceeding with respect to American.''   FCA's fourth quarter loss of $224.6 million boosted its deficitfor the year to $468 million for all of 1987, and gave it anegative net worth of $163.4 million at year-end.   In a brief statement, FCA spokeswoman Layna Browdy said, ``Wecommend the bank board and Wall Street for arranging this agreement(on repos). We've had a good and long-standing relationship withWall Street which is being helped by this latest actoin taken bythe bank board.''   FCA declined to elaborate or to say comment on the board'sdecision not to issue a new comfort letter.</TEXT></DOC>
