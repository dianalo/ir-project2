Lena Arlene Wilson sued Lowe, contending he enticed her daughter,Jan Parsons, then 16, into a videotaped encounter with anotherwoman. The incident occurred last summer, when Lowe was in town forthe Democratic National Convention. The lawsuit seeks unspecifieddamages.   U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell scheduled a hearing Mondayon a motion by Lowe's attorneys to dismiss the lawsuit. They alsoare seeking to recover court costs from Ms. Wilson and her attorney.   According to published reports and court documents, Miss Parsonsand a friend met Lowe, star of films including ``The Hotel NewHampshire'' and ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' at downtown Atlanta's Rionightclub during the Democratic convention last July. They returnedto his hotel suite, where they had sex with him and each other asLowe taped the proceedings.   Excerpts from the videotape have been shown repeatedly ontelevision news in Atlanta.   A motion by Lowe's attorneys denies he ``has committed anywrongful acts giving rise to liability.'' But a motion from Ms.Wilson's attorney says witnesses have confirmed Lowe had sex withMiss Parsons, and contends that Lowe has admitted it to hisCalifornia lawyers.   Lowe's attorneys have contended that Ms. Wilson and her formerhusband attempted to blackmail the actor before filing theirlawsuit, but Ms. Wilson's attorney denies any such attempt.</TEXT></DOC>
