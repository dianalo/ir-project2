President-elect George Bush named Scowcroft on Wednesday as hisnational security adviser, a choice that suggests his administrationplans a cautious course in foreign policy. Over the past threeyears, the retired Air Force lieutenant general has publicly opposedsome key Reagan initiatives.   Bush spelled out a low-profile role for Scowcroft, making itclear that another pragmatist already nominated to his Cabinet,Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III, ``will be the chiefspokesman ... on foreign policy matters.''   Scowcroft, 63, will serve as ``an honest broker'' Bush said.``Because of his tremendous experience, obviously he will convey tome, unvarnished, his own view on policy matters of tremendousimportance.''   Scowcroft played much the same role for President Ford. He beganhis White House career as military assistant to President Nixon in1972-73, then deputy to national security adviser Henry A. Kissingerfrom 1973-75 and national security adviser from 1975-77.   Before his appointment on Wednesday, Scowcroft was a foreignpolicy adviser to the Bush campaign and vice chairman of Kissinger'sconsulting firm.   Scowcroft was born in Ogden, Utah, graduated from West Point in1947, and rose through the Air Force ranks to lieutenant general. Onthe way, he picked up master's and doctoral degrees in internationalaffairs from Columbia University. A Mormon, he is married and hasone daughter.   Scowcroft's appointment drew quick praise from Sens. ClaibornePell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,and Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who was chairman when the Republicanscontrolled the Senate.   ``I think it's an excellent appointment,'' said Pell. ``I'veworked with Brent Scowcroft for years and I think he'll do a finejob.''   Lugar called Scowcroft ``an extremely able and experienced publicservant whose comprehensive knowledge of defense and arms controlhas engendered substantial confidence in Congress throughout theyears.''   Scowcroft shares Bush's publicly stated caution about moving tooquickly toward arms deals with the Soviets.   He has taken several stands over the past few years that put himat odds with Reagan, criticizing the Intermediate-Range NuclearForces treaty and urging the administration to use the Star Warsanti-missile program as a bargaining chip to get the Soviets'agreement to sharply reduce their arsenal of offensive missiles.   ``I think it is highly unlikely to expect any far-reachingreductions or changes in the Soviet system if they have to look overtheir shoulder at the unknown prospects of a defense for which theymay need these warheads,'' Scowcroft said in April 1985.   In September 1987, he criticized another pillar of thepresident's foreign policy, saying the United States would derivelittle benefit from the INF treaty, which eliminates superpowerballistic missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles. Reagan andSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the pact at their Washingtonsummit last December and the Senate ratified it last spring.   ``The United States and its NATO partners, since the early 1950s,have relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to perserve the peacein Europe,'' Scowcroft said. Eliminating part of the nucleardeterrent without redressing the Soviet edge in such weapons astanks and artillery could undermine the Western alliance, he said, aposition also taken by Kissinger.   Scowcroft also criticized an offer made by Reagan at the 1986summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, to eliminate all ballistic missileswithin 10 years, saying: ``His vision, no matter how grand it maybe, is flawed and unrecognizable, at least in one step.''   On other issues, Scowcroft has said:   _The War Powers act, passed after the Vietnam war, is ``deeplyflawed'' and ``to the layman ... seems unconstitutional.'' The lawrequires congressional approval to keep U.S. troops in a war zone.   _The United States should emphasize increasing its own exports,not controlling imports, to end foreign trade imbalance.   _The Philippine people support keeping U.S. military bases intheir country. He directed a study on the issue for the nonpartisanCouncil on Foreign Relations.   That study was one of several blue-ribbon panels on whichScowcroft has served.   Besides his role on the Tower commission that investigated theIran-Contra affair, Scowcroft also served on a panel that advisedPresident Carter on arms control issues and on Reagan-appointedadvisory commissions on military procurement and on basing the MXmissile.</TEXT></DOC>
