Wymer marched into Big Bear Lake, Calif., one day in 1989and told finance director Jeffrey Brunsdon some things he wasmore than ready to hear.   Mr. Wymer wasn't promising band uniforms or big trombones,just a quick buck: a virtually risk-free way to invest thelittle resort town's $2 million capital-improvement fund. Theinvestment, he said, would earn at least two percentagepoints more than neighboring towns were getting on theirmoney, all because of his firm's sophisticated trading ofTreasury notes.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Brunsdon, an easygoing accountant, liked Mr. Wymer. Itwas such a &quot;positive experience&quot; dealing with the 6-foot-2,athletic-looking salesman, who kept a rowing machine just afew steps from his office desk in Irvine, Calif. And he fitright in with the 5,700 retirees, ski buffs, and urbanescapees in this town nestled in the San Bernardino Mountainsabove Los Angeles.   But after the phone rang the afternoon of Dec. 13, 1991,Mr. Brunsdon realized he had been had. The call was from theSecurities and Exchange Commission. And the message was this:The capital-improvement account managed by Mr. Wymer had astated balance of $2,481,207 but was really worth $247. Theremust be a mistake, Mr. Brunsdon said.   Mr. Wymer was arrested four days later at his house inNewport Beach, Calif., and later was indicted by a federalgrand jury on charges of &quot;orchestrating a massive fraudscheme&quot; that the government says has cost 14 cities andinvestment trusts more than $113 million. Mr. Wymer has beencharged with 30 counts of securities fraud, mail fraud, moneylaundering and making false statements.   Prosecutors say Mr. Wymer, 43, put some of the money touse financing a life style that included several homes, threepleasure boats and at least nine cars, including a $140,000Ferrari. Much of the $1.2 billion he managed has beenaccounted for; $113 million is still missing. Attorneys forMr. Wymer, who himself declines to be interviewed, say thatthere were &quot;trading losses,&quot; and that Mr. Wymer isn't guiltyof any wrongdoing.   It's clear he did a very good job sweet-talking officials,weaving himself into the local fabric, and camouflaging hispersonal spending. Then, too, there's the matter of all thoseallegedly phony account statements.   &quot;There may be a lot of Steve Wymers out there&quot; sellingdubious investments to unsophisticated local financeofficials, says Colorado securities commissioner Philip A.Feigin. &quot;The higher the rates treasurers get, the lower thetax burden. So they're likely to fall for the first `MusicMan' to come to town.&quot;   Small-town treasurers can be easy marks. Most haveaccounting or bookkeeping backgrounds but &quot;aren'tknowledgeable about the increasing number of sophisticatedinvestment strategies,&quot; says Connie Jamieson, San Diegotreasurer and president of the California MunicipalTreasurers Association. They are often parttimers, and theyhave so many other things on their minds. &quot;Some hire cops andfirefighters and people to pick up the trash,&quot; says Ms.Jamieson. &quot;And they're also given the responsibility ofinvesting millions of dollars.&quot;   A growing number of investment firms are catering to thecash-management and investment needs of municipalities. Itcan easily be a case of predator and easy prey.   &quot;There are a lot of sharks swimming around out there, andinexperienced people are going to get bit,&quot; says StanLindsay, president of the California Municipal FinanceOfficers Association.   The arrest of Mr. Wymer and the collapse of the company heowned, Institutional Treasury Management, have engenderedbitter legal battling among cities over what remains of the$1.2 billion. A number of people have had their lives throwninto disarray. They include a city finance director in Iowawho is out of a job and whose own pension money is in limbo,and an Iowa legislator who moonlighted as a marketing agentfor Mr. Wymer and is now the subject of a state ethicsinvestigation.   Federal investigators say the Wymer case is an instructivetale of how small-town treasurers can be snookered by aclever confidence game. The Wymer scheme, if it was that, wastimed perfectly. Small-town treasuries were hurting becauseof lower tax revenues in a recession. They had suffered cutsin allocations and grants from federal and state governments.As interest rates plunged on their Treasury securities andcertificates of deposit, they frantically sought ways to keepup city income.   Enter Mr. Wymer-low-key and unobtrusive. Few big moneymanagers had ever heard of him. And he remains something of amystery, thanks to a penchant for privacy and for inventingat least parts of his past.   Born and raised in Fullerton, Calif., south of LosAngeles, Mr. Wymer came from a middle-class family. AtFullerton High School, he ran cross-country, worked on theschool newspaper and was senior-class president. A schoolfriend, Dan Webster, calls him &quot;the kind of guy you wouldwant your daughter to go out with.&quot;   In applying for a license to sell securities with theNational Association of Securities Dealers, Mr. Wymer wrote,correctly, that he graduated from the University ofCalifornia at Irvine in 1969 with a degree in mathematics. Headded that he then moved to Boulder, Colo., and wasself-employed. A friend says he was a building contractorpart of the time.   So far so good. But according to information he providedto Dun andamp; Bradstreet in March last year, he had been &quot;a seniorengineer&quot; at Rockwell International Corp. in Anaheim, Calif.,from 1966 to 1975. Rockwell says he worked for it from June1966 until June 1968, as a &quot;part-time data reduction clerkwhile he was a student.&quot; He was a &quot;summer-hire mathematician&quot;in 1968, and worked as a beginning engineer for nine monthsafter that. He was never a senior engineer, the company says.   In 1980, Mr. Wymer moved back to Southern California,where, after a brief stint selling classic cars, he had aseries of jobs at small brokerage firms, according to thefiling for his securities license. In 1986, he started Denmanandamp; Co., and specialized in managing money for small cities. Aspresident of Denman, which later became InstitutionalTreasury Management, he built the firm's assets from $200million in 1988 to $1.2 billion, federal prosecutors say.   A few investment pros who met him were surprised at hisapparent success. &quot;He was a sales type by temperament insteadof a fixed-income person,&quot; says Michael Stolper, a San Diegoconsultant who picks money managers for wealthy clients andpension funds. &quot;I could never figure out how he could{consistently} increase returns by two percentage points bysophisticated trading techniques with Treasurys. It's hard tobe clever in some areas, and trading Treasurys is one ofthem.&quot;   City treasurers didn't invest their short-term cash withMr. Wymer merely because he was charming and athletic: Hedidn't charge a commission on trades, as other brokers do.His contract called for his firm to get 30% of any nettrading gains; cities would get 70%.   More important, Mr. Wymer used politicians and formerofficeholders to help market his services. In California, hehired Harold Brewer, for 26 years the finance director forthe city of Riverside. He also enlisted Kirby Warner, theformer assistant city manager and treasurer of Palm Desert.Neither man has been charged with any crime, and both declineto talk about their ties to Mr. Wymer.   A good word from Mr. Brewer helped a lot. &quot;I wouldn't havedone this if Steve Wymer approached me directly -- onlybecause I had a working relationship with Hal Brewer,&quot; saysRonney C. Wong, director of administrative services forBeaumont, Calif. &quot;If he is working with Steve Wymer, Ithought things have got to be good.&quot;   And, overall, things were good, Mr. Wong says. &quot;Wereceived monthly confirmations of various trades. Every timeI asked for a withdrawal, I got my money that same day. Andwe were getting returns of 2 or 3 percentage points over thegoing C.D. rate. I didn't see how we could lose.&quot; ButBeaumont did lose. The $527,048 the city thought its accountwith Mr. Wymer was worth turned out to be only $22,439, theSEC says.   In Iowa, Mr. Wymer hired the president of the statesenate, Joseph Welsh, as a commissioned salesman. In January1990, three local governments set up the Iowa Trust, aninvestment pool formed to get a higher return than mightotherwise be possible. By the end of 1991, 88 Iowamunicipalities were participating. They hired Mr. Wymer'sfirm to manage their money.   Mr. Welsh, who is now being investigated by a specialethics panel of the Iowa Senate, has been accused by othersenators of using his position to advance legislation thatallowed the Iowa Trust to be set up, and to block legislationthat would have put controls on the trust's investmentpolicies. As an Institutional Treasury salesman, Mr. Welshwas paid $16,000 in 1990; his 1991 earnings haven't beendisclosed.   Iowa authorities now allege that Mr. Wymer illegallydiverted more than $75 million from Iowa Trust accountsthrough transfers of its investments, overcharges andinaccurate credits.   Mr. Welsh, who declines to be interviewed, said intestimony to the Iowa senate ethics committee earlier thismonth that he had lived up to the senate's rules andstandards and hadn't done anything wrong. &quot;I'm sorry StevenWymer stole money from Iowa Trust,&quot; he said. &quot;I am sorry myfamily has had to experience my pain and embarrassment.&quot;   Other Iowans also are paying a price for their involvementwith Mr. Wymer. Elaine Gundacker, an Iowa Trust trustee andcity finance director of Marshalltown, one of the first Iowacities to invest with Mr. Wymer, has been put onadministrative leave and sued by Dubuque, one of the citieswith money in the fund.   Mrs. Gundacker, 58, who hasn't been reappointed to anotherterm as finance director, says she is being made a scapegoat.&quot;After 30 years in municipal government in Iowa, I've beenabandoned by my government,&quot; she says. Mrs. Gundacker saysthat she met Mr. Wymer just two or three times and &quot;didn'tknow him personally.&quot; He was &quot;nice but always very busy&quot; whenshe talked to him on the phone about the city's account, shesays.   In its indictment, the government charges that Mr. Wymersent clients phony confirmations of trades and false accountstatements. The goal, investigators say, was to make currentclients think they were getting higher returns than theyactually were and to attract new customers. To cover lossesor to meet a withdrawal request, Mr. Wymer shifted funds fromaccount to account, &quot;robbing Peter to pay Paul,&quot; says LosAngeles Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger.   Mr. Asperger says that the allegedly illegal schemeapparently dates back to 1986, when Mr. Wymer started Denmanandamp; Co. From February 1988 through December 1991, Denman andsuccessor Institutional Treasury Management prepared at leastone fraudulent transaction confirmation for at least 69 ofthe two firms' 105 government and pension-fund clients, theindictment charges.   There were some warning signals along the way thatsomething irregular was going on. Clients never got detailedprint-outs of the 70-30 splits, despite repeated requests,several say. Michael Williams, who was elected part-timetreasurer of Colton, Calif., says he asked Mr. Wymer to comeup with just one documented example of a trade -- &quot;pick anyone you want,&quot; he recalls saying -- to verify that Colton gotits 70%. After three meetings, Mr. Wymer was never able toproduce the example, so Mr. Williams dismissed the firm.   Although he drove a Mercedes-Benz, Mr. Wymer didn't flaunthis lavish life style to the city treasurers with whom hedealt. &quot;He didn't wear gold chains or $4,000 suits,&quot; says Mr.Williams.   His neighbors on Santiago Drive in Newport Beach, anaffluent city 40 miles south of Los Angeles, say Mr. Wymerand his second wife, Anne Marie, pretty much kept tothemselves. Their house is surrounded by high shrubs andprotected by a security gate. The government seized the houseand a total of $10 million in Wymer property earlier thismonth.   A year ago, Mr. Wymer purchased three identical red MazdaMiata convertibles as Christmas bonuses for his threesecretaries. His wife paid for them with a company check,says Kory Johnson, sales manager of Campbell Mazda in CostaMesa, Calif.   When federal agents entered the Wymer home to search forevidence last month, they found a copy of a book called &quot;Howto Launder Money&quot; on a bedroom nightstand. One of Mr. Wymer'sattorneys, Paul N. Murphy, says the book is Anne Marie's, and&quot;there is no indication that Mr. Wymer either read orsubscribed to {advice in} the book.&quot; Mr. Murphy says hewouldn't &quot;presume to comment on Mrs. Wymer's bedtimereading.&quot;   ---   Wall Street Journal staff reporter Amy Stevens contributedto this article.</TEXT></DOC>
