Catabolic plasmids are nonessentialgenetic elements insofar as growth or viability of an organism is concerned,but they do provide a metabolic versatility not normally present in thecell. Accordingly, such genetic potential allows for the evolution ofintegrated and regulated pathways for the dissimilation of hydrocarbons.The interest in the genetics of such systems has closely paralleled thedevelopment of advances in molecular biology, particularly the applicationof recombinant DNA technology. The complexity of the genetic systemsinvolved in aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism is emerging, with this review,it is hoped, providing a comprehensive and detailed summary of our currentunderstanding of such complex genetic systems.</TEXT></DOC>
