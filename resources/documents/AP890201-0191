So far, there are 16 people in the pool of prospects from which12 jurors and six alternates eventually will be chosen. The judge inthe case said at day's end he hoped the jury could be selectedMonday.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell angrily said he wasconsidering holding ABC News correspondent Tim O'Brien in contemptof court. He said an ABC account Tuesday night ``appears to be adeliberate effort to obstruct'' jury selection by airingcongressional testimony North had given covering the same subjectson which he now faces charges.   The judge's comments showed continuing concern about thedifficulty of picking jurors unfamiliar North's previous testimonyabout the Iran-Contra affair. He testified in nationally televisedcongressional hearings in 1987 under a grant of limited immunityfrom prosecution.   North himself has steered clear of public comments going into andout of the courthouse. However, he cracked a few jokes about thetrial in remarks to a religious group at a breakfast early Tuesday.   He said he could stay only a few minutes because ``I have anappearance elsewhere that I have been invited to.'' Then he said,``Normally in order to speak, I have to have a subpoena.''   Before jury selection resumed after lunch, North signed severalautographs for an admirer in the courtroom, then gave him a friendlyslap on the shoulder.   The 12 felony charges against North include lying to Congress andthen-Attorney General Edwin Meese III about his role in theIran-Contra affair and illegally using a tax-exempt foundation tohelp finance a ``secret war'' against Nicaragua's Sandinistagovernment.   ``It seemed like the whole world was talking about thattestimony,'' defense lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. said in court,trying to probe a prospective juror's knowledge of North's publicadmissions two years ago that he lied and destroyed NationalSecurity Council documents.   Gesell excused three prospective jurors who said they had seenNorth's congressional testimony, including a department store clerkwho acknowledged that she ``heard something'' about North shreddingdocuments on one of the dozens of TV sets displayed where she worked.   But the judge brushed aside defense objections to inclusion ofothers, notably a hospital laboratory technician who said she hadseen North on television but couldn't ``remember anything he said.''   ``Usually I turned the channel'' to another program, she said.   North lawyer Barry Sullivan urged the judge to abide ``by theprinciple that no juror be seated who saw Col. North testify.''   But Gesell said, ``I have to take into account your client was onTV a great deal under all kinds of circumstances. She did say shesaw him but she did not say she heard him.''   Another chosen for the jury pool, a mental health administratorwho has testified dozens of times in court, said she hadn't paidmuch attention to North's testimony because she had just changedjobs.   Simon objected to her selection, calling her ``almost aprofessional witness.'' He also said she received newspapers at herhome that delved into North's testimony with such prominentheadlines that she ``could not miss critical portions of histestimony.''   At the start of the second day of jury selection, Gesell said hehad ``not made up my mind'' but was considering whether O'Brien'saccount of Tuesday's proceeding provided an ``appropriate basis fora contempt action.''   The judge said O'Brien, who was not in court during Gesell'sremarks but was there later, ``took pains'' to tell viewers that ifthey watched the excerpts of North's congressional testimony theywould not have to serve on the jury.   Roone Arledge, president of ABC News, said in a statementdistributed in New York: ``Correspondent Tim O'Brien reported fairlyand accurately what has been said in public regarding the Northcase. The public's right to be informed need not conflict with thefair administration of justice. Last night's `World News Tonight'segment informed our viewers about events already having taken placein public arenas. They cannot now be erased.''   North's admissions to Congress cannot be used against him asevidence, and Gesell has ruled that no one who heard the formerNational Security Council aide's congressional testimony could siton the jury.   The judge plans to pick a panel of 50 prospective jurors beforeallowing prosecutors and defense attorneys to exercise an as-yetunspecified number of peremptory challenges. Seven were pickedTuesday. At the end of Wednesday's session, Gesell said questioninghad ``gone very well'' and he hoped to ``move for jury selection onMonday.''   Defense lawyers for the retired Marine lieutenant colonel did notobject to seating an Army sergeant who served from 1963 to 1978, hada top secret security clearance and was in Vietnam during the Tetoffensive.   The man now works in a security job and said he didn't recognizeNorth, a decorated fellow veteran of the Vietnam War.</TEXT></DOC>
