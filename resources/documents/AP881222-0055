Wojciech Jaruzelski hasoverhauled the ruling Politburo and offered the clearest indicationyet that Solidarity may be reinstated.   At Wednesday's meeting of the Communist Party's governing CentralCommittee, Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski announced that theparty would reevaluate its attitude toward the outlawed trade unionfederation.   ``We are saying clearly that we desire to discuss the futuremodel of the trade union movement _ different from the present _together with the OPZZ (official union movement) and moderateleaders of former Solidarity,'' he said.   Reached today at his home in Gdansk, Solidarity leader LechWalesa called Rakowski's remarks significant, but said direct talkswith the government were needed to make sure the authorities areready to legalize the union movement.   ``It is a pretty far-reaching statement, and we hope we aretalking about the same thing,'' Walesa said by telephone. ``To seeif it is, we will still have to conduct direct talks. We believe itis the point, but we want it formulated in a clearer manner.''   ``It is a signal, but we are saying once again that withoutSolidarity, without relegalizing Solidarity there is no possibilityof agreement,'' Walesa said. The movement was crushed by a 1981military crackdown and outlawed the following year.   Rakowski told committee members Wednesday to return to localparty units and poll members on the subject of Solidarity and onWalesa.   He told them to return to Warsaw in mid-January with theiranswers at the 230-member body's next session: ``Your answer ...will decide about what we will do. And what we do will decide thefuture of socialism in Poland.''   In the leadership shakeup, Jaruzelski removed six hardliners andveteran members from the Politburo in favor of younger pragmatists.   Among those promoted to full membership was Stanislaw Ciosek, aliberal who has been active in conducting talks with Walesa. Ciosekwas also given an important additional post of full party secretary,where he was expected to assume responsibility for propaganda.   In all, eight new Politburo members were appointed, increasingthe Politburo's size from 15 to 17 members. Four members of theSecretariat, responsible for day-to-day operations of the party,were replaced by new blood.   The two-day meeting was capped by Jaruzelski's plea to theopposition to accept the party's offer for talks. He said it appearsWalesa can be trusted to keep a moderate course.   Referring to the opposition's formation on Sunday of a CitizensCommittee intended to gather mainstream anti-government forces inone structure under Walesa's leadership, Jaruzelski said:   ``One can freely create governments in exile or shadow Cabinets... but the real reconcilation of Poles is the cause of supremeimportance. Our party opts for it decisively and honestly.''   The newly named Secretariat members were: Ciosek; ZygmuntCzarzasty, the Slupsk province party chief who developed areputation as a strong advocate of pragmatic reforms; Leszek Miller,a young party chief from Skierniewice province, and Marian Stepien,a high-ranking party ideologist.   Among those ousted from the Politburo was Zbigniew Messner,Rakowski's predecessor as prime minister who resigned in a barrageof criticism of his handling of the economy.   Poland is in the throes of an economic crisis and strikes lastsummer calling for the Solidarity's reinstatement only aggravatedthe situation.   In an attempt to make the centrally planned economy moremarket-oriented, the government raised prices by more than 40percent early this year. Wages have not kept up.   New Politburo members were: Ciosek, Gabriela Rebisz, KazimierzCypryniak, Iwona Lubowska, Zdzislaw Swiatek, Viktor Pyrkosz, JanuszReykowski and Zbigniew Michalek.   Jaruzelski had said personnel changes were necessary for thesuccess of party reforms. At the opening of the meeting Tuesday, hesaid the party should be open to unconventional compromises with theopposition but it must remain Poland's ``key political force.''</TEXT></DOC>
