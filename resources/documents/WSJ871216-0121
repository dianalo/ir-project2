BrowningStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP MDEST WNEWSMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)AEROSPACE (ARO) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a sudden turnaround, the French government fired the chairman of a state-owned explosives manufacturer that allegedly sold explosive powder to Iran.    A Defense Ministry spokesman said the government has &quot;doubts,&quot; but hasn't any proof of wrongdoing at Societe Nationale des Poudres andamp; Explosifs, or SNPE. Still, the government's action adds new fuel to charges that European companies have contributed heavily to arming Iran in its war with Iraq.    &quot;An inquiry conducted over several months led to doubts, which the company's management was unable to remove, concerning the final destination of certain exports,&quot; said a Defense Ministry spokesman. The spokesman implied that the exports involved Iran, but refused to say so officially. He said the Defense Ministry and the French customs service are continuing their investigation, in cooperation with foreign customs services.    The fired chairman, Guy-Jean Bernardy, who has led SNPE since 1983, isn't considered personally to blame, the spokesman said. &quot;But he is being held personally responsible for all the company's activities,&quot; said the spokesman.    Documents uncovered by a long-running Swedish customs investigation suggest that SNPE may have shipped some of the thousands of tons of explosives that a consortium of European munitions-makers sent to Iran in the mid-1980s. The munitions may have gone into Iranian artillery shells and mines. Sweden sent a report on its investigation to several European countries, including France. The report has produced legal charges against company officials in Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands. Until now, French officials have denied turning up any suspicious activity at SNPE.    Officials at SNPE repeatedly have denied that they knowingly shipped munitions to Iran, although they left open the possibility that some of their customers might have duped them by trans-shipping to Iran. Defense Minister Andre Giraud, who demanded Mr. Bernardy's resignation, earlier this year stood behind the company. &quot;Hundreds of companies in the world export powder,&quot; he told a reporter in August. &quot;I would be surprised if they follow the trail of each sack of powder they export.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
