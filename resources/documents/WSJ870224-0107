But Cellular Communications Inc., an Ohio-based manufacturer of electronic communications equipment, demonstrated that the Euromarkets can be very interested in a high-tech issue. Celluar's $50 million of convertible 15-year 6% bonds, issued at par, were quoted at 101.    The bonds carry a conversion premium of 18% to 22% above the share price. Terms are scheduled to be fixed Friday, lead underwriter S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. said.    Fixed-rate bonds finished unchanged to down 1/8 point. Professionals again accounted for most of the activity, as they have for much of the past month.    U.S. Treasurys ended little changed, with the 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 quoted at 99 6/32, down 1/16 from Friday's New York close and 7/32 from the day's opening.    Euromark issues dropped about 1/4 to 1/3 point.    West German mark issues and government bonds, which dropped 1/4 to 1/2 point, were sold by foreign buyers anxious about the dollar accord's effect, traders said.    &quot;There's a very big uncertainty&quot; in the market, a trader said, that is keeping domestic investors away.    Swiss franc bonds ended mixed, with some issues dropping 1/4 to 1/2 point, traders said.    Many investors continued to resist current yield levels, traders and syndicate managers said, and the market remained filled with unplaced paper.    With nine Euroyen issues in the past several days totaling the equivalent of $1.45 billion, investors have been able to become very selective, Euroyen specialists said.    But the crowded market found room for Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s first Euroyen offering. Its $390.5 million of five-year 4 7/8% bonds were trading at 101 1/8, less 1 5/8 bid. Lead underwriter was Nomura International Ltd. </TEXT></DOC>
