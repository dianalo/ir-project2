After six days of meetings in the office of federal mediatorDoug Hammond, talks on a new three-year contract collapsed whenunion negotiators rejected the last company offer Saturday.   McKean and Baker said at separate news conferences Sunday thatthey didn't expect any new talks this week. Hammond agreed, sayinghe would remain in daily contact with both sides to determine whento try to resume the talks.   A previous attempt by Hammond to get negotiations going duringthe strike failed after three hours on Oct. 18.   The last Boeing strike lasted 45 days in 1977.   McKean said the new offer addressed employees' concerns byboosting lump-sum bonuses, cutting mandatory overtime andincreasing retirement benefits, although the total money was thesame as in a three-year offer rejected by union members in an 85percent strike vote Oct. 3, a day before the walkout.   ``We're waiting for the union to bring their members to theKingdome and vote on this proposal,'' McKean said. Companyofficials were ``totally confident it would be approved,'' he said.   The union has monitored membership sentiment throughout thestrike by weekly surveys, Baker said, rejecting any chance of avote on the offer.   ``Putting it to a vote would only mean more anger,'' he said.   Meanwhile, Boeing has been negotiating under a news blackoutsince Tuesday with its second-largest union, the SeattleProfessional Engineering Employees Association, which representsabout 28,000 engineers and technical workers. That contract expiresDec. 1, with both sides saying a strike is unlikely.   Baker said reductions in the cost-of-living provisions of thelatest offer to the Machinists amounted to 17 cents to 27 cents anhour, depending on overtime and pay level.   ``Really, it's a takeaway,'' Baker said. ``It's actually lessthan the offer we rejected Oct. 3.''   McKean said about 10 percent of those represented by theMachinists are crossing picket lines, ranging from 4 percent in thePuget Sound area, where union membership is mandatory, to 34percent in Wichita, Kan., where membership is voluntary under statelaw.   Union leaders have maintained the figures are far lower.   ``This is the strongest strike I've ever seen,'' Baker said.   The Machinists represent about 57,800 workers, including 43,300in the local district lodge, 12,000 in Wichita, 1,700 in Portland,Ore., and a few hundred at scattered sites in California, Hawaii,Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and other states.   The offer would have cut mandatory overtime from 200 to 144hours per quarter and assured workers at least every third weekendoff. The previous offer called for 160 hours of mandatory overtimeand a maximum of three weekends in a row.   The Oct. 3 offer included annual pay raises of 4 percent, 3percent and 3 percent, with bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay inthe first year and 3 percent in the second.   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the new offer contained thesame wage increases with bonuses of 10 percent, 4 percent and 4percent. The additional bonus money was offset by lowercost-of-living provisions and company contributions to someinsurance payments.   Retirement benefits would have been increased across the board,while other benefits would remain the same as in the previousoffer, Binder said. Boeing also would have paid health premiums forNovember, which striking workers now must pay or go withoutcoverage.</TEXT></DOC>
