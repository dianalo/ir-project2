Police and the Israeli military said one Israeli officer waskilled and three soldiers were wounded in nine hours of air, navaland ground fighting about 50 miles north of the Israeli border.   It was believed to be the deepest Israeli incursion into Lebanonsince September 1983, during the Lebanon war. The Israelis did notsay why they launched a paratrooper raid on the town.   Police said eight pro-Syrian guerrillas were killed and 16wounded.   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-GeneralCommand, the apparent target of the attack, said only two of itsfighters were killed and six wounded. It claimed in a communiquethat it was holding 17 Israelis and that another Israeli was held bySyrian troops.   Police and Israeli military sources said four Israelis weretrapped at one point in the fighting but were rescued. The Israeliarmy said no Israeli soldiers were left behind when the fightingended.   Lebanese police said Syrian troops fired at attacking Israelijets and sent troop reinforcements to the embattled areas, but theysaid there was no evidence the troops were directly involved in theground combat.   The fighting, which police said involved hand-to-hand combat,raged for nine hours near an abandoned Maronite Catholic monastryabove Naameh, nine miles south of Beirut.   Palestinian guerrillas ambushed an Israeli force of about 50paratroopers who landed helicopters in a ravine below the monastryat 2:10 a.m., one police spokesman in Naameh said.   Militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's ProgressiveSocialist Party joined the battle an hour later, police said.   Israeli warplanes then thundered in from the Mediterranean,blasting guerrilla posts above Naameh in at least 20 sorties. TheIsraeli military said an unspecified number of guerrilla commandposts and other targets were destroyed.   Guerrillas fired shoulder-fired SAM-7 missiles, known asStrellas, at the raiding jets, but no hits were scored, police said.They said Israeli pilots released hot air balloons to deflect theheat-seeking missiles.   Convoys of Syrian military trucks and armored personnel carriersrolled southward, into the embattled areas on the coastal highwayafter Israeli reinforcements stormed ashore about 10 a.m. in landingcraft two miles south of Naameh.   There was no evidence the Syrian troops were involved in theactual combat.   Israel radio, however, quoted Lebanese sources as saying Syriansopened fire on Israeli troops as they landed on the coast butstopped firing once the force was fully ashore.   Israeli gunboats cruised off Naameh and five helicopter gunshipshovered overhead, apparently waiting to evacuate the paratroopers,the spokesman said.   Palestinian guerrillas and the leftist Lebanese militiamen wereseen firing at the helicopters from jeep-mounted, anti-aircraft gunsalong Naameh's beach.   The spokesman said the dead Israeli officer commanded thereconnaissance battalion of Israel's Golani brigade, an eliteinfantry force that undertakes most of Israel's specialanti-guerrilla operations in Lebanon.   Israeli military officials identified him as Lt. Col. Amir Meital.   Beirut International Airport, on the capital's southern edge, wasclosed and incoming flights were diverted to airports in nearbyDamascus, Syria, and Larnaca, Cyprus.   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem cabinet ofthe country's dual government, instructed Lebanon's ambassador tothe United Nations, Rashid Fakhoury, to lodge a complaint at theworld body against ``this flagrant Israeli aggresssion,'' his pressoffice said.   The area where the fighting occurred is controlled by thepro-Syrian Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-GeneralCommand, led by Ahmed Jibril, and Jumblatt's Progressive SocialistParty.   Many cars were seen speeding out with honking horns from thestricken bluffs to the coastal highway. They were believed rushingcasualties to hospitals in Sidon and Beirut.   Distant thuds of explosions could be heard in Beirut as theplanes staged Israel's 24th air raid on Lebanon this year.   Shopkeepers hurriedly lowered their shutters as hundreds ofNaameh residents scurried to take shelter in basements.   At least 119 people were killed and 333 wounded in Israel's 23previous air raids on Lebanon since Jan. 3.   The last major Israeli incursion into Lebanon was May 2, when aforce of about 1,500 Israeli troops and allied South Lebanon Armyconducted a two-day sweep into southern Lebanon.   Three Israeli soldiers and 40 guerrillas were killed in theoperation, the first time a large Israeli force had pushed beyondthe six-to-10 mile deep border security zone since February 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
