The 11-member Delta Lambda Phi fraternity was recognizedThursday.   ``Gay people need a lot of support in their college years,''said senior Jason Howe, the group's president. ``They are trying tocome to grips with growing up, getting through college and gettinga career. But they also have to come to grips with theirsexuality.''   The fraternity is a spinoff of a Washington-based organizationtrying to form chapters at campuses around the country.   ``We are trying to encourage socializing outside of the barenvironment and its negative emphasis on alcohol and drugs,'' saidfraternity adviser Chris Williamson.   Official recognition means Delta Lambda Phi can use the school'sname, meet on campus and apply for student activities funds, saidChris Fishburn, UCLA's director of fraternity and sororityrelations.   The fraternity cannot discriminate against heterosexuals, if anyapply.</TEXT></DOC>
