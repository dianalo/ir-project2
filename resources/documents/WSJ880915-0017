Over Proxy Material </HL><SO> </SO><CO> TTI </CO><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A shareholder charged that Technical Tape Inc. and several of its directors didn't disclose certain pending litigation in proxy material for the company's plan to be acquired.    In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, Murray Rosen also names as defendants Technical Tape's president and chief executive officer, Austin Iodice, and Beiersdorf AG of Hamburg, West Germany. Last month, Beiersdorf definitively agreed to buy Technical Tape for $16 a share, or about $57.6 million. The suit calls this price inadequate.    The suit, which asks the court to certify it as a class action, seeks to block Beiersdorf's tender offer for Technical Tape. It also requests unspecified damages.    Technical Tape, a New Rochelle, N.Y., maker of pressure-sensitive tape, couldn't be reached for comment. Beiersdorf makes tape, toiletries, health-care products and pharmaceuticals.    Mr. Rosen's suit says that the proxy material failed to disclose that three shareholder derivative suits were consolidated and are pending against Technical Tape in state Supreme Court, a trial court, in Brooklyn.    The consolidated derivative suit charges that certain transactions Technical Tape entered violated directors' fiduciary obligations and wasted corporate assets.    Mr. Rosen's suit says the tender-offer price is inadequate because it doesn't reflect all of Technical Tape's assets but does reflect the allegedly improper transactions.    In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Technical Tape closed yesterday at $15.75 a share, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
