Snyder, public affairs director of theCitizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms.   He and other gun lobbyists were on Capitol Hill last week tocombat a bill sponsored by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, thatwould halt sales of AK47s, Israeli-made Uzis and a host of othermilitary-style weapons with banana clips, wire stocks andsinister-looking snouts that roughly fall under the heading ofassault rifles.   Led by the efficient and well financed National RifleAssociation, gun lobbyists base their muscle on support fromhundreds of thousands of hunters and other gun owners across thecountry who fear they will lose their weapons.   Lawmakers have long been reluctant to tangle with the NRA forfear of repercussions at election time.   The NRA's power, however, may have waned a bit in recent yearswhen lawmakers approved a ban on plastic guns that fail to registeron metal detectors and required the attorney general to come up witha plan to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals.   The NRA ended up supporting the plastic gun ban after initialopposition failed to scuttle it. Handing the more complicatedassignment to the attorney general represented a compromise struckafter the Senate balked at a House-passed plan to do no more thanstudy the problem.   Opponents of the NRA, however, say there is no question that itstill wields considerable power.   ``The NRA has intimidated members of Congress in a politicalsense with their money and their political muscle,'' says Rep.Edward F. Feighan, D-Ohio, who was defeated last year in an effortto win approval of a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers. He istrying again this year.   Metzenbaum, however, was re-elected handily while under attack bythe NRA.   His supporters say the criticism was offset somewhat by anendorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police, based in part on hissupport for gun control. They say the Senate may well pass assaultrifle legislation this year.   The current round began shortly after a Jan. 17 incident in whicha gunman opened fire with an AK47 on 400 children on a playgroundoutside the Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, Calif.   Five youngsters died and 29 were injured along with one teacher.Three persons remain in the hospital.   First to respond with legislation was Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.   ``The slaughter of citizens on the streets and children in theschoolyard by weapons designed for slaughter on the battlefield mustbe stopped,'' delared Berman.   His bill, however, has not generated wide support, even among guncontrol advocates, mainly because it bans possession of assaultrifles and thus requires owners to turn them in to police or thelocal sheriff. By contrast, Metzenbaum's bill would ban sales of theweapons but not possession.   Trying to collect huge numbers of semiautomatic rifles already inprivate hands could plunge the bill into a political quagmire,control advocates fear.   Other California congressmen, including Reps. Vic Fazio,D-Calif., and Fortney H. (Pete) Stark, D-Calif., have been searchingfor a less stringent formula. And any bill clearly has a long, hardhaul to reach floor passage.   In the Senate, Illinois Democrat Paul Simon's Judiciarysubcommittee on the Constitution is believed to be closely dividedover whether to push legislation this year. But even if it isblocked there, Metzenbaum still can go to the floor and appeal tothe whole Senate to attach his bill to other legislation.   NRA lobbyists say guns dubbed assault weapons are not muchdifferent from more traditional hunting guns. They call the majordifference cosmetic and point to the military-style appearance ofthe AK47s and Uzis.   ``There is no functional difference between those firearms thatare currently being called assault rifles and what would be calledtraditional hunting rifles,'' says NRA federal lobbyist DavidConover.   He claims that Metzenbaum's measure would not only outlawrapid-fire grease guns and pistol-gripped, round-drummed``streetsweeper'' shotguns but such old standbys of the sportsman asthe wooden-stocked Remington model 4.   The same disclaimer of any ``functional difference'' wasexpressed at last week's hearing by Edward Conroy, acting deputyassociate director for law enforcement of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco and firearms.   But he also expressed sympathy with the aim of the legislation totake assault weapons out of the hands of criminals.   NRA spokesman have been arguing that a ban on the weapon wouldnot really work because it would be disobeyed by criminals and keptout of the hands of law-abiding hunters and other sportsmen. ButMetzenbaum scoffs at that notion.   ``We know of only one instance in which this was used forhunting,'' he declared last week. ``When a psychopath in Californiawent hunting school children.''</TEXT></DOC>
