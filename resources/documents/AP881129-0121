Such an action would be catastrophic, the agency said.   Though framed in terms of Los Angeles, the legal issue could someday be applied to many of the 107 cities and rural counties that donot meet federal air pollution standards.   The agency is under court order to promulgate an air pollutioncontrol plan for the Los Angeles area, by far the dirtiest of the107 and home to one American in 18.   Los Angeles fails to meet federal pollution standards for ozoneand carbon monoxide, and it is the only area not meeting standardsfor nitrogen oxides.   In recent years, peak ozone concentrations have been almost threetimes the standard, which typically is exceeded on 145 occasionsannually. No other city has peaks more than 75 percent above thestandard or more than 35 violations per year.   Ozone, which damages the lungs in high concentrations, is formedin sunlight by the reaction of nitrogen oxides, a combustionproduct, with certain hydrocarbon compounds such as gasoline vaporor solvents. The South Coast Air Quality Management District hasestimated that an 80 percent to 90 percent reduction in hydrocarbonemissions, half of which come from transportation fuels, would beneeded to meet the ozone standard in the Los Angeles area.   After several postponements, all cities were supposed to meet thestandards by Dec. 31, 1987 _ but Congress has never been able todecide what happens next.   EPA has announced, but not formally adopted, plans generallyrequiring 3 percent annual reductions in emissions of the relevantpollutants beyond whatever reductions result from federal programssuch as new auto standards.   Though EPA is involved in several court cases, Los Angeles is theonly area where EPA is under orders to fulfill the legal mandate toimpose its own control plan where it has found local plansinadequate.   Tuesday's 142-page notice asked what compliance date an EPA planshould adopt.   EPA tried before, in 1973, to order drastic cutbacks in emissionsin Los Angeles, but in 1977, Congress required new control plans toshow attainment generally in three years to five years. For LosAngeles now, ``A plan aimed at attaining these standards in fiveyears would have to ban the sale or use of fossil fuels for cars andtrucks, airplanes, boats and trains,'' EPA's announcement said.   Such a plan ``would necessarily prohibit almost all (hydrocarbon)emissions from manufacturing activities, and ban all products with(hydrocarbon) emissions _ for example paints, waxes, pesticides,auto anti-freeze, cleaning products, lubricants and suntan lotions.''   ``It would be impossible for most people to commute to work andfor most forms of commerce to continue. ... It is evident that ashort-term (federal plan) would have catastrophic consequences'' andcould be impossible to enforce, EPA said.   EPA clearly preferred the alternative of embracing the ambitiousplan now being developed by the South Coast district aimed atcompliance by 2007, when unspecified technological advances couldmake almost all cars in the area powered by electricity. It askedfor comment on the feasibility of adopting ``backstop'' federalmeasures to take effect if particular parts of the state plan fellby the wayside.   The agency said it would consider the public comments inconjunction with its judgments on the South Coast plan, expected tobe formally submitted to the agency next spring.   EPA published its dilemma on the same day the American LungAssociation issued a strongly critical report of the agency'shandling of state plans.   The association said local affiliates examined state plans fornine metropolitan areas _ Hartford, Conn., Los Angeles, Houston,Philadelphia, Washington, St. Louis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Baltimoreand Chicago.   The affiliates reported significant failure to carry out promisedcontrol measures, widespread failure of EPA to meet deadlines fordecisions, lax operation of auto pollution inspections, use ofout-of-date data and computer models and frequent double counting ofemissions reductions.</TEXT></DOC>
