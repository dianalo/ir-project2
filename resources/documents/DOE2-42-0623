Improving cask efficiency willnot only reduce life cycle transportation costs, but also is consistentwith maintaining public and occupational radiological risks and, moreimportantly, total risks (radiological and nonradiological) within theguidelines of the ``as low as reasonably achievable'' (ALARA) philosophy.Increases in cask capacities will reduce both the total number of shipmentsrequired to transport a given amount of fuel and the number of handlingoperations at both shipping and receiving facilities. Additional capacityincreases can be achieved by implementing various design strategies basedon new concepts and/or the actual characteristics of the majority ofthe spent fuel to be shipped in the future. For example, it has beendetermined that additional capacity increases can be achieved by takingcredit for burnup, the reduced reactivity that results when fuel hasbeen used to produce power in a nuclear reactor. That is, as the fuelis used the atoms of fissile material decrease, and neutron absorbers(or ``poisons'') that tend to retard the fission process are produced.7 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
