Leakey said in an interview.   Japan, a leading center for the manufacture of ivory products,Friday announced it would ban imports at least until the end of theyear. Most of the world's ivory comes from the tusks of the Africanelephant.   Japan imported 106 tons of ivory last year, compared with 143tons in 1987 and 475 tons in 1983.   Conservationists warn that illegal slaughter could make theAfrican elephant extinct in the wild by the mid-1990s. Leakeypredicted that elephants will one day only live in national parks orother reserves.   Leakey, who wore a necktie with a pattern of skulls, is known forhis research on the first humans.   He made his most important find at the age of 26 on a hillside inhis native Kenya: a skull and other bones he judged to be nearly 3million years old. The discovery provided important evidence aboutthe early stages of human development.   The 103 governments that signed the Convention on Illegal Tradein Endangered Species are to meet in Lausanne, Switzerland,beginning Oct. 9. A major issue will be whether to switch theAfrican elephant from a ``threatened'' to an ``endangered'' species.Trade is banned in products from endangered species, though limitedexceptions may be granted.   Some countries, including Zimbabwe and South Africa, may opposethe switch on the ground that they are effectively managing theirown elephant herds, so that there should be no objection to theirsales of ivory.   ``For South Africa that's probably the case, for Zimbabwe,probably not,'' Leakey said.   Leakey praised the United States government, which has bannedivory imports, and the American public for its attitude towardbuying ivory objects. The public attitude is more important than anygovernment ban because illegal slaughter has risen only because ofincreased demand, he said.   ``When the people of the world stand up to be counted, ivory willno longer be sold,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
