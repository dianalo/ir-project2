The Order requires agencies to analyze their proposed policyinitiatives to determine whether they will have these effects and, if so,whether there are alternative ways of structuring the initiatives to achievethe Federal objective, with the least possible adverse effects on the operationsand functions of State or local governments. The Order also contains specialrequirements for the preemption of State law by Federal statutes and regulations,and for the submission of proposed legislation to Congress.

The main body of the Order_Sections 1 through 3, and6 and 7_is designed to ensure that agencies take federalism concerns intoaccount when developing and implementing expressions of agency policy thathave ``federalism implications.'' Section 4 of the Order prescribes specialrequirements for the preemption of State law by Federal statutes and regulations.Section 5 contains special and requirements for the submission of proposedlegislation to Congress.These three elements interact in the following ways. Section 5 establishesa threshold requirement for policy initiatives that are expressed in proposedlegislation. Legislative proposals that meet this threshold, and all otherpolicies covered by the Order (except preemptions subject to Section 4),are subject to review and analysis under the ``federalism implications''provisions of the main body of the Order. Section 4 establishes requirementsthat are independent of the rest of the Order: If the issue involves statutoryor regulatory preemption, only Section 4's special requirements apply.The Main Body of the OrderFor purposes of the main body of the Order, policies that have ``federalismimplications'' are those that have ``substantial direct effects'' on Statesor their political subdivisions, or on the relationship or distributionof power among the various levels of government. All forms of agency policystatements and policy actions may be subject to the Order, but its greatesteffect will be on regulations and proposed legislation_agencies' most visibleways of implementing policy initiatives. An agency policy initiative thatdoes not meet the ``federalism implications'' threshold of applicabilityis not subject to the main body of the Order. (See Sections 1 through 3,and 6 and 7 of the Order.)The Order requires that agencies take steps to identify policies that have``federalism implications'' during the policy development stage, beforea final decision is made to proceed with the policy. This timing is designedto ensure that the Order's provisions are taken into account at the earlierstages of the process, when policies are still sufficiently open that federalismconcerns may have genuine effect on the policy's course. To the extentpracticable, agencies are required to consult with affected States or theirpolitical subdivisions as part of the process for developing proposalswith ``federalism implications.'' In appropriate cases, agencies may haveto modify or abandon the proposed policy initiative to comply with theOrder's requirements. The controlling inquiries in this analysis are whetherthe proposed policy has ``federalism implications'' and if it does, whetherthere are alternative ways of structuring the policy to achieve the Federalobjective with the least possible negative effects on the operations andfunctions of the States and their political subdivisions. (See sections2 and 3 of the Order.)The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will assess an agency's performanceunder the main body of the Order when the agency submits its regulatoryand legislative initiatives for OMB review under existing Executive Ordersand OMB Circulars. (See section 7(b) of the Order.) Where the agency determinesthat the proposed policy's ``federalism implications'' are sufficient,the agency will prepare a ``Federalism Assessment.'' The ``Assessment''will be used for the agency's internal use, including review by the agencyhead, in determining whether to proceed with the proposal. It will alsobe used by OMB in determining the consistency of the proposed policy withthe Order's provisions. (See section 6 of the Order.)As noted above, any proposed legislation that falls within the Order'sspecial requirements for legislation may not be transmitted to the Congress.(See section 5 of the Order.) With this one exception, the Order does notspecifically prohibit implementation of a proposed policy, even where thepolicy is not consistent with the ``federalism implications'' of the mainbody of the Order.The Order does, however, contemplate a continuing dialogue on proposalsthat have ``federalism implications,'' through consultation with affectedgovernmental entities; internal agency discussion; review by OMB; and,where a ``Federalism Assessment'' is required, personal review by the agencyhead. Thus, even if the Order itself imposes no bar to proceeding witha given policy initiative, these consultation and review features may resultin the elimination or modification of the proposal involved. (See sections3, 6, and 7 of the Order.)<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 5.</ITAG>Section 5 of the Order prohibits agencies from sending proposal legislationto Congress that falls within its proscriptions. Specifically, proposedlegislation may not directly regulate the States in areas of essentialState autonomy; attach conditions that are not directly related to theproposal's purpose; or preempt State law, unless the preemption is necessaryto achieve a valid Federal purpose. Section 5 applies to all proposed legislation_irrespectiveof whether the proposal meets the ``federalism implications'' thresholdof applicability under the main body of the Order.<ITAG tagnum="81">Section 4.</ITAG>Section 4 of the Order contains special provisions governing the preemptionof State law by Federal statutes and regulations. These provisions generallytrack current Supreme Court precedent governing such preemptions, but imposea ``firm and palpable evidence'' test for assessing the degree of congressionalintent required to justify a regulatory preemption or a statutory preemptionwhere congressional intent to preempt is inferred.<ITAG tagnum="84">Implementation of the Order</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Table of Contents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">I.

Definitions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Section 2 of the Order)As used in this Notice:<T3>Benefit program </T3>means any program administered by the Departmentinvolving grants, loans, interest or rental assistance, mortgage or loaninsurance, or any other kind of assistance.<T3>Circular A-19 </T3>means OMB Circular A-19, <T3>Rev</T3>., <T3>Legislative Corrdination and Clearance </T3>(1979).<T3>Congress </T3>means the Speaker of the House or the President of theSenate; any Member of Congress; the staff of any Member of Congress orof any committee, subcommittee, or other establishment of Congress; orany other officer or employee of Congress.<T3>Designated Official </T3>means the HUD official under Section 6(a)of the Order whom the Secretary designates as responsible for ensuringthe implementation and operation of the Order in accordance with its provisions.On January 4, 1988, the Secretary designated HUD's General Counsel as theDesignated Official.<T3>Executive Order </T3>or <T3>Order </T3>means Executive Order 12612, <T3>Federalism </T3>(52 FR 41685, published October 30, 1987).<T3>Executive Order 12291 </T3>means Executive Order 12291, <T3>Federal Regulation, </T3>3 CFR 127 (1981), <T3>reprinted in </T3>5 U.S.C. app. 601 at 136 (Supp. v 1981).<T3>Federalism implications </T3>means the effects referred to in the definitionof <T3>policies with federlism implications, </T3>below.<T3>Formulation and implementation </T3>means, with respect to a policyinitiative, the entire policy development process, during which the identificationand analysis of policies with federalism implications under the Order takeplace.<T3>HUD </T3>or <T3>Department </T3>means the United States Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment.<T3>Legislation comment </T3>means any written expression of official HUDviews on proposed or pending legislation (other than legislation proposedby HUD) that is prepared for (a) Transmission to Congress or OMB, (b) presentationas testimony before a congressional committee, or (c) release to any personor entity outside the Executive Branch. The term includes: (1) Any commentor recommendation on pending legislation included in any annual or specialreport that HUD proposes to transmit to Congress, or to release to anystudy group, commission, or member of the public; and (2) OMB requestsfor HUD views on the proposed legislative comments of other agencies andon enrolled enactments. The term does not include requests from Congressfor technical advice and other technical services in connection with proposedor pending legislation.This definition is patterned after the one contained in Circular A-19.The Department has adopted this approach, since Section 7(b) of the Orderrequires agenices to identify and discuss federalism concerns in theirCircular A-19 submissions. Ensuring that OMB and the Department are workingfrom essentially the same definition will facilitate both the Department'scompliance with the Order and OMB's review of the Department's performanceunder the Order.The definition differs from Circular A-19 in several respects. It subjectsto the Order's requirements letters prepared for OMB or for release tothe public that contain HUD's position or proposed or pending legislation.It also excludes from its coverage technical drafting services and technicalcomments on HUD-proposed bills.OMB requests for HUD comments are added, since they fit squarely withinthe term, ``legislative comments,'' and represent a large share of theDepartment's legislative reporting activity. Release of HUD's views onproposed or pending legislation to the public is covered, since such actioncan clearly have significant ``federalism implications.''Circular A-19 now exempts from its coverage technical <T3>drafting </T3>services performed by Federal agencies at Congress' request.This Notice extends the exemption to specifically include situations inwhich the Department is asked to provide technical <T3>reviews </T3>of, and <T3>comments </T3>on, draft legislative language prepared <T3>by Congress. </T3>The Department believes that there is no need toinvoke the Order's requirements for technical advice, because, as CircularA-19 recognizes for agency technical drafting services, technical servicesby definition do not involve the ``policy'' issues with which the Orderis concerned.Moreover, technical review of pending legislation services a genuinelyimportant function: Technical problems can be identified and resolved <T3>before </T3>the legislation is enacted. This not only ensures thatthe law reflects congressional intent, but also permits the Departmentto invest limited time and resources in implementing the legislation afterits enactment, rather than diverting resources in an attempt to resolvethe technical problems. Since many congressional technical services requestsrequire immedicate ``turn-around,'' subjecting these services to the Order'srequirements could often prevent HUD from making meaningful comments andhaving the desired effect on congressional consideration of the legislationinvolved.<T3>Main body of the Order </T3>means sections 1 through 3 and 6 and 7of the Order.<T3>OMB </T3>means the Office of Management and Budget.<T3>Pending legislation </T3>means any bill or resolution that has beenintroduced in the Senate of the House of Representatives, any amendmentto a bill or resolution while in a committee of Congress or when proposedfor House or Senate consideration during debate, or any proposal placedbefore the conferees on a bill that has passed both Houses.This definition is substantively the same as that contained in CircularA-19.<T3>Policies that have federalism implications </T3>means all or part ofany regulation, legislative comment, proposed legislation, or other policystatement or policy action, that has (or will have, when implemented) substantial,direct effects on: (a) The States, or (b) the relationship between theFederal government and the States, or (c) the distribution of power andresponsibilities among the various levels of government.As noted later, this definition is central to the implementation and operationof the main body of the Order: It establishes the threshold for determiningwhether individual HUD policy initiatives are subject to the Order's requirementsfor the identification and review of federalism issues under sections 2,3,6,and 7 of the Order.In determining whether a policy's effects on States will be `'substantial''and ``direct,'' the Department will use a functional approach: do all thefacts and circumstances of the policy proposal reach the level of importanceand immediacy contemplated by the Order generally, and by the terms ``substantial''and ``direct,'' as defined below? The Department believes that attemptingto fashion a detailed, a <T3>priori</T3> definition would result in a test that would be both toorigid and too loose, and that would lack the necessary flexibility to beadequately sensitive to the Order's objectives. The functional approachwill permit the full and fair assessment of the ``federalism implications''of all HUD's policy proposals that is contemplated by the Order.Finally, the Department believes that the Order is primarily, of not exclusively,concerned with preserving and enhancing the <T3>institutional </T3>aspects of States and their political subdivisionsin their <T3>role </T3> or <T3>status</T3> as governmental entities. Thus, the Order requires agenciesto focus upon the effects of agency policies <T3>on </T3>States, or <T3>on </T3>the <T3>relationship </T3>or the <T3>distribution of power and responsibility among </T3>the various levelsof government. It does not appear that just any ``effect'' on States_evenif it is ``substantial'' and ``direct'' (within the Order's meaning)_wouldbe adequate to trigger the Order's applicability. For example, a new grantprogram may affect States_perhaps even in significant ways_but not bringinto question the <T3>role </T3> of the States vis-a-vis the national government or othergovernmental entities.Thus, to be subject to the Order, the agency policy initiative must affectthe role or status of States or their political subdivisions in directand substantial ways. Examples could include a proposal to impose a Federalrequirement in an area formerly left to State discretion, or a proposalto require States to impose sanctions on their political jurisdictionsfor violation of mandatory Federal standards.As noted above, the determination of whether a given policy initiativehas the requistie effects on the institution of the States will be madeon a functional basis, taking into consideration all the facts and circumstancesof the policy involved.<T3>Policy action </T3>means an identifiable event in the policy developmentand implementation process: (a) That occurs when the essential elementsof the policy are settled and (b) that is undertaken as a significant steptoward implementation of the policy.This definition does not attempt to identify the nature of an ``action``with exactitude. Instead, it recognizes that for purposes of the Order,a ``policy action'' may take many form, depending on the facts of eachcase, and it provides general guidance that should be useful across themany circumstances that may give rise to a ``policy action'' under theOrder.The definition also attempts to identify the general place in the policyformulation/implementation continuum in which an ``action'' of significanceto the Order is likely to occur: After most of the ``thinking'' is overand the remaining steps to effectuate the policy are primarily ones ofimplementation. Spotlighting this place in the policy <T3>formulation </T3>phase of the process is true to the implicit and explicitconcern throughout the Order, that policy matters be identified and assessedwhile the policy is being developed_while the policy issues are sufficientlyunsettled that the policy's federalism implications may receive a fulland fair hearing, and the Order's precepts will have a chance of alteringthe policy.Focusing on the early stages of the <T3>implementation</T3> phase of the process_the point at which the remainingsteps primarily involve execution_ensures that the ``action'' will be identifiedearly on the road to implementing the policy, thus also providing assurancethat the Order's provisions will be applied at a meaningful point in theprocess.Thus, a ``policy action'' occupies an analogous place in HUD's policy formulationand implementation process as the publication of a regulation or the dispatchof legislative comments or proposed legislation to their intended audiences:It is the point by which any of the Order's requirements that apply tothe policy must be met.It also is important to specify that an ``action'' must be ``significant.''This will permit the Department to focus on meaningful implementation steps,without having to sort through the many, relatively unimportant, ``action''that typically make up the policy formulation and implementation processin order to identify ``the action'' that has significance under the Order.The types of policies that might be of interest under the Order may includethe following: Litigation policy; the imposition and enforcement of sanctionsagainst individual State and local governmental entities, such as PublicHousing Agencies (PHAs) in the Public and Indian Housing program (42 U.S.C.1437, <T3>et seq</T3>.), and States and Entitlement communities in the CDBG programunder title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42U.S.C. 5301, <T3>et seq</T3>.); information dissemination; certain HUD research decisions;Federal Budget decisions that do not require legislative or regulatoryimplementation; and the oral transmission of legislative comments or proposedlegislation, to the extent their written counterparts are subject to theOrder.Considering litigation policy as a ``policy action'' under the Order raisesspecial issues. By its nature, litigation does not admit of the free interchangeof views among affected parties that the Order contemplates. In addition,many of the policy options that arise during the pendency of litigationmust be assessed primarily in terms of what the ``other side'' is arguing,and is likely to argue during the rest of the suit; how the court willreact; and what effect any given course may have on the ultimate outcomeof the action. Often, decisions must be made in accordance with exceedinglyshort, court-imposed deadlines. Although the Order applies to litigationpolicy as a type of ``policy action,'' the Department believes that specialcare must be taken to ensure that the Order operates in a way that doesnot jeopardize the Department's litigation objectives.The Department engages in two general types of litigation: Affirmativelitigation, in which the Department pursues a claim against a party, anddefensive litigation, in which another party pursues a claim against theDepartment. For affirmative litigation, the Department will comply withthe Order's requirements to the extent practicable when determining whetherto commence litigation: <T3>i.e., </T3>the Department will take the Order's precepts into accountin determining whether to sue, whom to sue, the legal theories to be used,and the type of relief to be requested. Since the Department is the plaintiffand, thus, will frame the issues in the litigation, this initial reviewunder the Order will generally cover all the federalism concerns that arelikely to arise in the matter. In the unlikely event that the litigationturns in ways that raise new federalism concerns, the Department will complywith the Order's requirements at that time to the extent feasible.In defensive litigation, the Department has very little freedom to framethe scope of the litigation, and is generally in the position of respondingto the plaintiff's arguments. Thus, defensive litigation_unlike affirmativelitigation_does not offer a single point where review of the litigationissues in light of the Order can be effectively carried out.There are, however, two instances in which review under the Order may bepossible. First, where settlement of the litigation is under consideration,the Department would have at least some room to assess the proposal inlight of the Order's precepts. Second, issues of preemption of State lawoccasionally arise in the course of defensive litigation. These issuescould be reviewed in light of Section 4 of the Order as they are encountered.Because of the essentially ``reactive'' posture of the Department in defensivelitigation, it is doubtful that other points along the defensive litigationspectrum will involve the kind of policy discretion contemplated by theOrder. If, however, such a situation arises, the Department will complywith the Order's requirements to the extent feasible.Finally, as noted above, many aspects of litigation policy do not fit comfortablywith the Order's precepts. One area that may raise serious issues is theOrder's frequent reference to advance consultation with affected parties.(See the consultation provisions under the Federalism Policymaking Criteriain Sections III.B. and C.(3)(iv), and the speical requirements for preemptionunder Section V.D.) Depending on the nature of the litigation, the Departmentmay have the opportunity, and may find it appropriate, to engage in someform of consultation before the litigation is commenced. Indeed, this wouldoften be done in the case of affirmative litigation, where discussionswith the entities involved would routinely precede any decision to proceedwith litigation. Even defensive litigation may afford the opportunity forthis type of advance consultation.However, as the Department's consideration begins to turn away from informalmethods of achieving its objectives, and the likelihood of a litigatedresolution of the case becomes greater, the need to develop the litigation'spolicy without discussing it in public_especially with those entities mostdirectly affected by it, the other parties to the action_will render furtherconsultation infeasible in the vast majority of cases. Again, it shouldbe noted that the Order itself recognizes the need for flexibility in providingadvance consultation, by permitting the agencies to determine whether suchaction is feasible and, if so, of what the ``consultation'' should consist.Considerations similar to affirmative litigation attend the impositionof administrative sanctions against States. Thus, the Department will complywith the Order to the extent feasible in determining whether to invokean administrative sanction. Since the Department frames the sanction issue,it is reasonable to expect that review of the issue under the Order willreach all the federalism issues involved. If, however, changed circumstanceswarrant a fresh review of the action's federalism impacts, the Departmentwill comply with the Order's requirements to the extent feasible at theappropriate stage of the proceeding. <T3>Policy proposal </T3>or<T3> policy initiative</T3> means any HUD regulation, legislative comment,legislative proposal, or other policy statement or policy action.<T3>Policy statement </T3>means a statement of HUD policy, other than asubstantive regulation, that must be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> under 24 CFR Part 10. The term includes Noticesand Notices of Funding Availability that must be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The term does not include less formal meansof policy communication, such as HUD Handbooks, Notices to the Field, Noticesto Public Housing Agencies (PHAs), or Mortgagee Letters, that are not subjectto publication under Part 10. <T3>Proposed legislation</T3> means draft legislative language_both authorizingand appropriating_or any supporting document (<T3>e.g., </T3>a ``Speaker letter,'' section-by-section analysis, or statementof purpose and justification) that HUD sends to OMB for review under CircularA-11 or A-19 for transmission to Congress, or for release to any personor entity outside the Executive Branch. The term includes any proposalfor, or endorsement of, Federal legislation included in any annual or specialreport prepared by the Department or in other written form which the Departmentproposes to transmit to Congress, or to make available to any study group,commission, or the public. The term does not include requests from Congressfor technical drafting and other technical services with respect to proposedlegislation.This definition follows the definition of ``proposed legislation'' in CircularA-19. The exception for technical drafting services is based on a similarexception in the Circular. The definition includes both authorizing andappropriating legislation, since the Order's use of the term, ``proposedlegislation,'' is clearly broad enough to encompass both, and both canhave the types of federalism effects that the Order is designed to reach.<T3>Regulation</T3> means all or part of any departmental statement ofgeneral or particular applicability and future effect designed: (a) Toimplement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy; or (b) to describe theDepartment's organization, or its procedure or practice requirements.This definition is taken from 24 CFR Part 10, HUD's ``rule making'' regulations.The definition governs the Department's regulatory functions, and is essentiallythe same as that used for determining the necessity for OMB review or regulatorydocuments under Executive Order 12291. Since sections 6(c) and 7 of theOrder contemplate OMB review of agency rules and federalism assessments,use of the Part 10 definition will satisfy both HUD's and OMB's requirementsfor the production and review of rules.<T3>Secretary</T3> means the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.<T3>States</T3> means the several States of the United States of America,individually or collectively and, where relevant, State governments, includingunits of local government and other political subdivisions establishedby the States; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; the District of Columbia;the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Somoa,and any political subdivisions established by them; and the Trust Territoryof the Pacific Islands.The term includes governmental entities that have general governmentalpowers (such as city or county) and those that have limited or specialpowers (such as PHAs).Although the Order does not explicitly include as ``States'' Puerto Rico,the District of Columbia, the Insular Areas, or other Territories and Possessionsof the United States, these entities are considered to be ``States'' or``units of general local government'' for many of the Department's programs.These include the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program undertitle I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C.5301, <T3>et seq.</T3>), the public housing program under the United States HousingAct of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437, <T3>et seq.</T3>), FHA mortgage and loan insurance under the National HousingAct (12 U.S.C. 1702, <T3>et seq.</T3>), and the homeless housing initiatives in title IV ofthe Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11361, <T3>et seq.</T3>). The Department believes that it is appropriate to includethese entities within the Order's coverage, since many of the same ``federalism''issues inhere in their relationship with the Department and it is importantto foster uniformity of treatment among the many types of governmentaljurisdictions that participate in the Department's programs.<T3>Substantial direct effects </T3>means effects that are: (a) Significantor important (not minor or insignificant) and (b) immediate (not incidental,or derived or received from or through another entity).II. Applicability</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Sections 1(a) and 2 through 7 of the Order)<ITAG tagnum="81">A. In General</ITAG>The Order is divided into three principal elements. The main body of theOrder_Sections 1 through 3, and 6 and 7_provides guidance on the formulationand implementation of policies that have ``federalism implications.'' Section5 (Section IV. of this Notice) prohibits agencies from transmitting toCongress proposed legislation that falls within its proscriptions. Section4 (Section V. of this Notice) contains special requirements for the preemptionof State law by Federal statutes and regulations.These elements interact as follows. Section 5 establishes a threshold requirementfor agency policy initiatives that are expressed in proposed legislation,without regard to their ``federalism implications.'' Legislative proposalsthat meet this threshold, and all other policy proposals covered by theOrder (except preemptions under section 4), are subject to review and analysisunder the ``federalism implications'' provisions of the main body of theOrder. Where a potential statutory or regulatory preemption is involved,<T3>only </T3>section 4 of the Order applies: <T3>i.e., </T3>the ``federalism implications'' of these types of preemptionswill <T3>not </T3>be assessed under the main body of the Order.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Policies with Federalism Implications</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Section 1(a) of the Order)(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The main body of the Order applies to ``policies thathave federalism implications.'' Thus, the threshold for the main body ofthe Order is reached when the HUD policy proposal involved has (or willhave, when implemented) substantial, direct effects on: (a) The States,(b) the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or(c) the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levelsof government.In determining whether the requisite effects are present, the Departmentwill consider the initiative as a whole, as well as any parts of it thatmay have federalism implications.(2) <T3>Limitations upon compliance with the Order. </T3>There are circumstancesthat may render full (or even any) compliance with the Order's ``federalismimplications'' requirements impossible or unnecessary, despite the presenceof policies that meet this threshold. As noted earlier, the Order is designedto ensure that federalism concerns are taken into account in agency policymaking. The <T3>sine qua non </T3>of achieving this end is the existence of a policythat is susceptible to influence. Where the policy involved is not amendableto change, or where review under the Order is impracticable or unnecessary,compliance with the Order will not be required.It should be noted that the Department will take these considerations intoaccount only if the policy involved has been determined to meet the Order's``federalism implications'' threshold of applicability. These limitationsdo not affect the presence of ``federalism implications'' in a given policyproposal; they merely serve to modify the extent to which the Order's prescriptionsmust be followed.Examples where the type of agency ``discretion'' contemplated by the Orderis not present include, but are not limited to, the following:(i) <T3>Further analysis is redundant. </T3>Where, for example, (A) the Orderwas complied with at an earlier stage in the policy development processand the policy proposal in question is the same; or (B) it has been changed,but without significantly altering its ``federalism implications'' or changingits purpose to such an extent that a new look at the proposal's relationshipto the Order would be warranted.Examples include moving a rule from proposed to final, where the proposal's``federalism implications'' were assessed at the proposed rule stage; andreproposing to Congress legislation that originally complied with the Order.In these cases, HUD will review the initial work under the Order, and determinewhether another round of review under the Order is necessary.(ii) <T3>Policies with little or no discretion. </T3>Examples include regulationsimplementing ``self-executing'' laws or statutory authorities whose implementationis within the statutory text or legislative history of the provision involved,thereby involving little or no discretion on the part of HUD in areas thatmay involve federalism issues. These types of regulatory situations willoften arise in connection with proposals that are being implemented byinformal communication, such as interim instructions, or by final rulewithout prior notice and comment, where lack of implementing discretionis cited in the preamble as a reason for skipping notice and comment. Thisexception also covers such items as litigation policy that the Departmentmust carry out under court order, and congressionally mandated researchprojects or Budget actions.(iii) <T3>Analysis is not feasible.</T3> Examples include regulations that areemergency in nature or that contain congressionally or OMB-imposed deadlinesthat make full compliance with the Order impossible, or legislative proposalsand comments that carry expedited deadlines from OMB or the Congress. Insuch cases, the Department will comply with the Order in as full a fashionas possible, given the time contraints. (iv) <T3>Technical matters.</T3> Examples include proposed legislation and legislativecomments that do not involve substantive issues, such as technical legislativeamendments or technical comments on pending legislation or simple extensionsof authority. In determining whether any of the above conditions is present in a givenpolicy initiative, the Department will limit its consideration to the aspectsof the proposal that exhibit the ``federalism implications.'' It also shouldbe noted that more than one exception may apply to a given policy initiative.Thus, part of the initiative may have undergone review under the Orderat a previous time, and another part of the proposal may be implementinga statutory mandate that permits little or no discretion in its promulgation.In such an instance, neither part of the proposal requires review and analysisunder the Order. (3) <T3>Effect of applicability.</T3> If a given policy initiative is determinedto meet the ``federalism implications'' threshold under paragraph B.(1)of this Section, and if review under the Order is not subject to exceptionunder paragraph B.(2) of this Section, the formulation and implementationof the initiative must be guided by the Fundamental Federalism Principlescontained in Section III.B. of this Notice, and the initiative must beanalyzed under the Federalism Policymaking Criteria of Section III.C. Inaddition, the need for a Federalism Assessment under Section III.D. ofthe notice must be determined, and the policy must be highlighted for OMBin the agency's submissions under Circular A-19 and Executive Order 12291.A policy proposal that does not have the requisite ``federalism implications''need not be assessed under the main body of the Order. C. <T3>Legislative proposals.</T3> Section IV. of this Notice establishesa threshold for all proposed legislation. The threshold applies irrespectiveof whether the proposal has ``federalism implications'' for purposes ofthe main body of the Order. Any proposal that falls within the provision'sproscriptions may not be sent to Congress. Proposals that meet the thresholdmay be subject to further ``federalism implications'' review and analysisunder the main body of the Order. D. <T3>Preemption of State law by Federal statutes or regulations.</T3> SectionV. of this Notice applies to all proposed preemptions of State law by Federalstatutes or regulations. Policies that are within this Section's coverageare not subject to review under the other provisions of the Order. Thisconclusion rests on two bases. First, as noted earlier, analysis of a policy initiative's ``federalismimplications'' under the Order presumes the existence of agency discretionin developing and implementing the initiative. The absence of this discretionrenders review and analysis under the main body of the Order unnecessary,since the Order does not have the ability to achieve its purpose of ensuringthat federalism concerns may influence the initiative's development andimplementation. In determining whether a statutory or regulatory preemption meets section4's standards, the only issue is whether there is sufficient evidence thatCongress intended to preempt the State law. This inquiry does not providethe necessary agency discretion to permit meaningful ``federalism implications''analysis. Establishing congressional intent does not involve federalismconsiderations, and a determination that Congress intended to preempt Statelaw leads the agency to do precisely that, irrespective of any federalismor other policy considerations that might be present. Second, section 4 contains additional provisions requiring that the extentof preemption be the minimum necessary to accomplish the Federal purpose,that affected officials and organizations be consulted when a preemptionissue arises, and that affected States in rule making proceedings involvingpreemption be given opportunity for appropriate participation in the action.These features are analogous to those provided elsewhere in the Order,and seem to demark a ``complete system'' for preemption subject to section4 that is separate from the ``federalism implications'' provisions of themain body of the Order. Finally, it should be noted that section 4 only applies to statutory orregulatory preemption. Other forms of preemption, such as a legislativeproposal seeking to preempt State law, are subject to review under otherprovisions of the Order, as appropriate. E. <T3>Exemption for activities under the Inspector General Act.</T3> Theactivities of the Department's Inspector General under the Inspector GeneralAct (42 U.S.C. 1404a) are exempt from the Order. The Department has consistentlyinterpreted the Inspector General Act as establishing an exclusive statutorycharter that is not subject to interference or dilution by administrativefactors external to the Act. In this instance, the very purpose of the Order is to require that an externalfactor_federalism concerns_be taken into account in the exercise of agencydiscretion. Application of the Order could affect a number of the InspectorGeneral's activities under the Act, including the requirement that is centralto the Inspector General's mission: That the Inspector General identifyand seek corrective action for fraud, waste, and abuse by participantsin HUD programs, including State or local governments. Consistent with its previous interpretations of the inviolability of theInspector General Act, the Department believes that the best approach issimply to exempt the Inspector General's functions under the Act from theOrder's provisions. It should be noted that the Order recognizes the possibility of such aninterpretation, by explicitly stating that the Order's requirements areto apply ``to the extent permitted by law.'' III. Review and Analysis of Policies that Have Federalism Implications<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Constitutional Considerations. (Sections 2, 3(a) and (b), 5(a),and 6(c)(4) of the Order) </ITAG>A number of the Order's provisions refer to its constitutional underpinningsand the principles that are to guide agencies in implementing it. Thus,sections 3(a) and (b) of the Order (Section III.C.(2) of this Notice) callfor strict adherence to ``constitutional principles;'' Section 3(b)(2)requires that agency policy initiatives not ``encroach upon authority reservedto the States;'' sections 2(b), (c), and (g) of the Order (see AppendixA to this Notice) refer to federalism in terms of State ``sovereignty''that is protected by the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution; and section5(a) (Section IV.A. of this Notice) prohibits proposed legislation thatwould: <ITAG tagnum="21">* * * interfere with functions essential to the States' separate andindependent existence or operate to directly displace the States' freedomto structure integral operations in areas of traditional government functions.</ITAG>Thus, the Order appears to view federalism from the perspective that thereare relatively fixed areas in which States enjoy clear constitutional protectionfrom Federal action. Some of the older Supreme Court cases_especially <T3>National League of Cities v. Usery, </T3>426 U.S. 833 (1976)_seem tobe in particular agreement with the Order's approach. The <T3>National League of Cities </T3>case involved Federal attempts to imposeFederal wage and hour provisions on a city public transportation agency.The Court framed the issue before it as whether the wage and hour determinationssought to be imposed were ``functions essential to the separate and independentexistence'' of the State (at 845). In ruling against Federal regulation,the Court found that these determinations would: <ITAG tagnum="21">* * * significantly alter or displace the States' ability to structureemployer-employee relationships in such areas as fire prevention, policeprotection, sanitation, public health, and parks and recreation. Theseactivities are typical of those performed by state and local governmentsin discharging their dual functions of administering the public law andfurnishing public services. Indeed, it is functions such as these whichgovernments are created to provide, services such as these which the Stateshave traditionally afforded their citizens. If Congress may withdraw fromthe States the authority to make those fundamental employment decisionsupon which their systems for performance of these functions must rest,we think there would be little left of the States' separate and independentexistence. (at 851)</ITAG>The Court stated its constitutional prescription as applying to any Federalaction that ``operates to directly displace the States' freedom to structureintegral operations in areas of traditional government functions.'' (at852)<T3>National League of Cities, </T3>however, was overruled by <T3>Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, </T3>469 U.S.528 (1985). Garcia involved the same issues as <T3>League of Cities. </T3>The approach adopted by the Court in <T3>Garcia </T3>was that the States' continuing role in the Federal systemis primarily guaranteed not by externally imposed limits, but by the structureof the Federal Government itself. That is, the Federal political <T3>process </T3>is the primary means for ensuring the role of States inthe Union, not efforts to identify ``traditional governmental functions''or other tests for determining the specific boundaries of Federal/Statepowers. The <T3>Garcia </T3>doctrine was recently amplified in <T3>State of South Carolina v. Baker,   </T3>U.S.   , 108 S.Ct. 1355 (April28, 1988). <T3>South Carolina </T3>involved the constitutionality of an Internal RevenueCode provision denying Federal income tax exemption for interest earnedon unregistered long-term State and local government bonds. In discussingthe federalism aspects of the issue, the Court stated, <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Garcia </T3>holds that the [Tenth Amendment] limits are structural,not substantive_<T3>i.e., </T3>that States must find their protection from congressionalregulation through the national political process, not through judiciallydefined spheres of unregulable state activity. (at 1360)</ITAG>In response to South Carolina's argument that the political process failedbecause the statute in question was enacted on the basis of insufficientcredible evidence, the Court stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">Although <T3>Garcia </T3>left open the possibility that some extraordinary defectsin the national political process might render congressional regulationsof state activities invalid under the Tenth Amendment, the Court in <T3>Garcia </T3>had no occasion to identify or define the defects thatmight lead to such invalidation * * * Nor do we attempt any definitie articulationhere. It suffices to observe that South Carolina has not even alleged thatit was deprived of any right to participate in the national political processor that it was singled out in a way that left it politically isolated andpowerless. Cf. <T3>United States v. Carolene Products Co., </T3>304 U.S. 144, 152, n.4 (1938). Rather, South Carolina argues that the political process failedhere because andSection; 310(b)(1) was ``imposed by the vote of an uninformedCongress relying upon incomplete information.'' * * * But nothing in <T3>Garcia</T3> or the Tenth Amendment authorizes courts to second-guessthe substantive basis for congressional legislation. Cf. <T3>Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </T3> 449 U.S. 456, 464, 101S.Ct. 715, 724, 66 L.Ed. 2d 659 (1981). Where, as here, the national political<T3>process </T3>did not operate in a defective manner, the Tenth Amendmentis not implicated. (at 1360-1361) (emphasis in original)</ITAG>Although the approaches adopted by the Order and <T3>Garcia/South Carolina </T3>appear to embody two different constitutionalstandards, the Department sees no inherent conflict in using these testsfor purposes of giving content to the Order. The <T3>Garcia/South Carolina </T3>analysis expresses the current constitutionalinterpretation of how far the Federal government may go in affecting States'actions. The Order, on the other hand, counsels a <T3>voluntary </T3>limit on the exercise of Federal power. Provided thatthe Federal action is within the <T3>Garcia/South Carolina </T3>standard, the approach taken by the Orderis without constitutional objection. Three provisions of the Order require constitutional analysis along thelines of <T3>National League of Cities.</T3> Section 3(b)(2) of the Order requiresagencies, in assessing the constitutional basis for policy initiatives,to ensure that the initiative does not ``encroach upon authority reservedto the States.'' Section 5(a) of the Order prohibits the submission toCongress of proposed legislation that directly regulates States ``in waysthat would interfere with functions essential to the States' separate andindependent existence or operate to directly displace States' freedom tostructure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.''Section 6(c)(4) requires agencies to identify the (extent to which a policyproposal would affect the States' ``ability to discharge traditional governmentalfunctions, or other aspects of State sovereignty. In devising a test that would faithfully implement these concepts, theDepartment shares the Supreme Court's frustration over fashioning constitutionalstandards that can be applied over a wide range of factual situations.Thus, for purposes of implementing these provisions, the Department believesthe best approach is to base its analysis on the test described above in<T3>National League of Cities: </T3>Does the policy initiative operateto directly displace the States' freedom to structure integral operationsin areas of traditional government functions? This test appears to be agood starting point for analyzing the various ``constitutional'' conceptsused in the Order, and has the further advantage of having been used todecide the federalism implications of actual fact situations by the highestcourt in the land. In applying this test, the Department will consider all the facts and circumstancesof the policy proposal. Among the factors that the Department may considerare the following: (1) Whether the function involves an area over whichStates have historically and typically had (or have been recognized ashaving) governmental autonomy; (2) how central the function is to the State'soperation as a State; (3) whether the Federal action would directly displaceor interfere with State discretion and, if so, to what extent would itdo so; and (4) whether the State discretion that would be displaced involvesimportant areas that are necessary to attainment of the State functionor to the ability of the State to function as a State.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Fundamental Federalism Principles</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Section 2 of the Order, Appendix A of this Notice)In formulating and implementing HUD policy initiatives that have federalismimplications, the Department will be guided by the series of FundamentalFederalism Principles that are contained in section 2 of the Order. Theseprinciples call upon Federal agencies to recognize the unique and importantrole that States and their political subdivisions play in the Federal system,and to fashion their policy initiatives in ways that encourage the diversityand creativity of States and localities in addressing issues of concernto them. In their consideration of policy initiatives, Federal agenciesare admonished to use a presumption in favor of State action and againstFederal regulation, unless Federal action is required by law or there issome other demonstrable justification for Federal action.A full listing of the Fundamental Federalism Principles appears at theend of this Notice, as Appendix A.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Federalism Policymaking Criteria</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Section 3 of the Order)(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Section 3 of the Order contains a number of criteriaagainst which the federalism aspects of agency policy initiatives are tobe measured. As noted in Section II.B.(1), above, these criteria applyonly to policies that have met the Order's ``federalism implications''threshold under section II.B.(1) of this Notice, and are not otherwiseexcepted from Order review under Section II.B.(2) of this Notice.It should also be noted that paragraphs C. (2) and (3) of this sectionframe their provisions in terms of analyses and determinations that ``should''be made. The Department intends to carefully and fully follow these provisionsas a general matter, except where some countervailing consideration counselsotherwise: that is, we will consider the ``should'' as the equivalent of``to the maximum extent practicable.'' The Department believes that thisapproach gives effect to the Order's objective: It preserves the generalapplicability of the Order, while giving agencies some room to work outproblem areas, without the ``straight jacket'' of a series of ``shall''imperatives.Thus, in addition to being guided by the Fundamental Federalism Principlesdescribed in Section III.B. and Appendix A of this Notice, HUD will, tothe extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable, adhereto the criteria in the following provisions of this Section when formulatingand implementing policies that have ``federalism implications.''(2) <T3>Policy initiatives that would limit the policymaking discretion ofthe States. </T3>(Sections 3 (a) and (b) of the Order) If the policy proposalwould ``limit the policymaking discretion of the States,'' the Order specifiesa number of prescripts that should be followed. The quoted phrase is notdefined in the Order, and is susceptible to several interpretations.Viewed in a more narrow sense, ``limit the policymaking discretion of theStates'' includes situations in which the Federal action is intended to<T3>actually </T3>reduce or remove State authority in areas in which theState has <T3>already acted </T3>or has the legal capacity to act <T3>in the future. </T3>This reading primarily includes matters of ``pureregulation,'' in which the primary purpose and direct effect of the policyinitiative is to regulate some aspect of State interest. This type of regulationmay require the preemption of State law to accomplish its objective. Agood example of this type of ``limit'' on State policy making discretionis the Federal attempt to impose the wage and hour requirements that wereat issue in the <T3>National League of Cities </T3>and <T3>Garcia </T3>cases.This interpretation of ``limit the policymaking discretion of States,''however, does not include policy actions involving HUD benefit programs.These programs are intended to convey some benefit on the public, and any``limit'' on State policy making discretion is only incidental to achievementof this overall purpose. Stated differently, HUD ``regulation'' of Stateand local governments in the context of benefit programs is not principallyintended to affect these governmental entities <T3>qua </T3>governmental entities, but merely enlists their assistancein carrying out the programs' purposes.The exclusion of benefit programs from paragraph C. of this Section drawssupport from the Order's rendition of the type of situation that may justify``limiting'' State discretion: Where ``national activity is necessitatedby the presence of a problem of national scope.'' This language clearlyrequires a Federal ``policy action'' that is primarily intended to addressa national problem. As noted above, however, to the extent benefit programsaffect State interests, they do so only as an incident to achievement ofthe Federal purpose involved.On the other hand, under a more expansive reading, ``limit the policymakingdiscretion of the States'' could include situations in which the agencypolicy could have less clear effects, for example, by moving into an areawhere <T3>no </T3>State policymaking has occurred, and the only ``limit'' onfuture State policymaking would be the putative ``chilling'' effect ofthe Federal activity in the area. Thus, in determining whether to proposethe Housing Voucher program_the centerpiece of the Administration's rentalhousing assistance strategy_this reading of the Order would have requiredthe Department to consider whether the existence of the new program wouldact to prevent or discourage States from experimenting with and establishingtheir own form of voucher assistance. It is generally fair to assume thatenactment of a new Federal benefit program will ``discourage'' State andlocal governments from entering into the same area, since the availabilityof the Federal money will prompt the governmental entity to use its resourcesfor other priorities. If this projection of the proposal's effects preventedthe Department from recommending enactment of the program, the result wouldhave been doubly detrimental: Not only would the public have been deprivedof a preferable way of delivering rental housing subsidy, but also theStates and localities would not have been provided a subsidy model thata number of these entities have in fact seen fit to replicate with theirown resources.On balance, the Department believes that the more narrow reading is preferable.A broader interpretation would apply to a host of HUD benefit programs,and would subject them to the constitutional and ``problem of nationalscope'' criteria in sections 3(a) and (b) of the Order. Most, if not allof these programs, and even amendments to them, arguably could not havebeen transmitted to Congress, if this reading of the Order applied to themin their policy development stage. This result would follow despite thefact that any ``regulation'' of States and localities is merely an incidentto the programs' overall purposes. The Department doubts that the Orderwas intended to have such dramatic effects on existing or future Federalbenefit programs.Thus, for purposes of the Order, the provisions of this paragraph C. applyto any policy initiative that is intended to actually reduce or removeState authority in areas in which the State has already acted or in whichthe State has the legal capacity to act in the future. This will be limitedto situations involving matters of ``pure regulations,'' and legislativepreemption designed to effectuate ``pure regulation,'' in which the primarypurpose and direct effect of the policy initiative is to affect areas ofState interest.This paragraph C. does not cover policy initiatives involving HUD benefitprograms, since such programs generally affect State interests only asan incident to their benefit purpose. It also does not reach preemptionsof State law by Federal statutes or regulations or incident to a HUD benefitprogram.Policies that fall short of this paragraph C.(2)'s standard may be coveredunder other provisions of the Order, but need not be assessed under thisparagraph C.The precepts that the Order specifies should be followed for policy proposalsthat would ``limit the policymaking discretion of the States'' and, therefore,are subject to this paragraph, are as follows.(i) <T3>Constitutional and statutory basis. </T3>There should be strict adherenceto constitutional principles. The constitutional and statutory authorityfor the proposed policy should be closely examined. No policy action shouldbe taken, unless the constitutional authority is ``clear and certain.''Authority is ``clear and certain,'' only when (A) the authority for thepolicy may be found in a specific provision of the Constitution, (B) thereis no provision in the Constitution prohibiting Federal action, and (C)the action does not encroach upon authority reserved to the States.For guidance on how the Department will interpret the phrase, ``authorityreserved to the States,'' see Section C. of this Notice.In determining whether the authority for a policy initiative ``may be foundin a specific provision of the Constitution,'' or whether there is anyconstitutional provision ``prohibiting Federal action,'' the Departmentwill not require that the action be <T3>explicitly </T3>referred to in the actual language of the Constitution.The constitutional authority for an action will be determined on the basisof the specific provisions of the Constitution, as interpreted by currentSupreme Court precedent. The Department believes that this approach willbe more than adequate to ensure the achievement of the Order's mandatethat agency policy proposals have a ``clear and certain'' Constitutionalbasis.(ii) <T3>Problem of national scope. </T3>No policy action should be taken, unlessnational activity is necessitated by the presence of a problem of nationalscope.The Order does not define ``problem of national scope.'' Section 3(b)(1)does, however, point out ``importance of recognizing the distinction betweenproblems of national scope (which may justify Federal action) and problemsthat are merely common to the States (which will not justify Federal actionbecause individual States, acting individually or together, can effectivelydeal with them).''The only guidance the Order offers to distinguish between these categoriesis that the States have the ability to deal with ``common'' problems. Theability of a State ``to effectively deal with a problem'' may turn on ananalysis of its actual fiscal strength and managerial capacity, or an assumptionthat States can handle ``common'' problems, irrespective of their actualcapabilities. Attempting to establish States' actual capacities would betime-consuming and probably not very politically feasible, not to mentioninformative. On the other hand, use of an <T3>a priori </T3>judgment about States' capabilities would be inadequateto account for the wide range of differences among governmental entities.The Department believes that the best approach is to focus on whether Stateshave the <T3>legal </T3>capacity to address these ``common'' problems, not whetherthey <T3>in fact </T3>have the capacity to do so. The language of the Orderdoes not suggest use of a facts-based test for defining ``common'' problems.Indeed, use of ``national'' and ``common'' seems to establish a textbookpolarity that ought not turn on the facts of individual cases.Thus, in assessing whether a HUD policy initiative addresses a ``problemof national scope,'' the Department will determine whether the affectedStates and local governments have the <T3>legal capacity </T3>to deal with the problem effectively, acting eitheralone or in concert. For purposes of the Order, ``legal capacity'' willinclude situations in which the State <T3>both </T3>has full legal ability to take effective action <T3>and </T3>the State does not have such ability, but could obtain itthrough appropriate enabling legislation or other action at the State level.In any case in which the States involved have the requisite legal capacity,the ``problem'' will not be considered to be one of national scope forwhich Federal action is permitted.For purposes of section 3(b) of the Order, the Department will give theword, ``problem,'' its dictionary meaning: A matter involving difficultyin solving or handling. As noted above, the existence of a ``problem''is a threshold requirement for Federal action under that Section. Thus,HUD action under section 3(b) must be directed toward resolving or otherwisedealing with an articulable, demonstrable difficulty requiring Federalintervention. Finally, ``national activity'' will mean action at the Federal level toaddress the problem. ``National scope'' will be defined as a nationwideproblem.Thus, for purposes of this paragraph C.(3)(ii), a ``policy action'' subjectto the Order may only be taken if action at the Federal level is requiredto address a demonstrable, nation-wide problem that States, acting aloneor in concert, do not have, or cannot obtain, the legal capacity to handleeffectively.(iii) <T3>Need for the policy action. </T3>The necessity for the policy actionshould be carefully assessed.In making this assessment, the Department will review not only the overallpolicy proposal, but also each of its aspects, to ensure conformity withthe objectives of the Order.(iv) <T3>Consultation. </T3>To the extent practicable, the States should beconsulted before any action under this paragraph C. is implemented.In determining whether consultation is ``practicable'' in a given case,the Department will consider whether consultation is feasible in all thecircumstances. Situations that might affect the feasibility of consultingwith the States include the number of State and local governments and officialsinvolved, and timing considerations for the HUD action.Consultation encompasses a wide spectrum of possibilities. At the ``full''end, consultation could include personal contact with all State officialsinvolved at the earliest stages of the policy development process, andcould accord these officials a controlling voice in the content of theproposal. On the other end of the spectrum, consultation could include``bouncing the proposal off'' a small number of officials late in the processor soliciting views on the proposal in <T4>Federal Register </T4>documents, when the fundamental policy proposalhas relatively clear definition.Given the accordion-like quality of ``consultation,'' the Department believesthat the best approach is to permit the content of the consultation tovary with the proposed policy action. This approach is very much in keepingwith the ``should'' nature of the provision, and makes sense as a way oftailoring the degree of consultation to the specific action involved. Inmaking this determination, factors that would affect the degree of consultationinclude: The seriousness of the Federal intrusion into State affairs, theseriousness of the Federal action proposed to be taken, the timing considerationsinvolved in the proposed Federal action, and how much discretion HUD hasin developing and implementing the policy.In fashioning the nature of the consultation with State officials, theDepartment will be mindful of the Advisory Committee Act. This Act requiresconsultations that meet its criteria to be conducted in a formal way, includingproviding notice of meetings and holding meetings on the record. The Departmentwill determine on a case-by-case basis whether this degree of formalityis warranted.The Department also wishes to note that the consultation referred to inthe Order should not be confused with ``negotiated rule making.'' Under``negotiated rule making,'' Federal agencies would identify individualsand entities, and groups representing them, that fairly represent the issuesand viewpoints that are likely to arise in connection with the rule making.These individuals and groups would work with the agency to decide uponthe content of the rule before it is published in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The Department does not consider the consultationprovision of the Order as requiring, or even suggesting, a move to ``negotiatedrule making,'' and will instead integrate the consultation that is to beaccorded in each case into the Department's existing rule making procedures.(3) <T3>National policies administered by the States. </T3>With respect tonational policies administered by the States, the agency should give theStates the maximum administrative discretion possible. Intrusive, Federaloversight of State administration is neither necessary nor desirable.This requirement has the potential for considerable effect upon the Department'spolicy initiatives, since many of the Department's programs involve theuse of States or their political subdivisions to carry out national policies.Examples of such programs include the Public and Indian Housing program(administered by PHAs) and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)program (administered by States and Entitlement grantees).(4) <T3>Undertaking to formulate and implement policies. </T3>Before the policydevelopment process begins, or as soon thereafter as possible:(i) <T3>Encouragement of States. </T3>HUD will encourage States to developtheir own policies to achieve program objectives and to work with appropriateofficials in other States.As in the case of consultation, the form and degree of encouragement thatHUD will give will vary with the facts of the individual case.  (ii) <T3>Uniform, national standards. </T3>HUD will refrain, to the maximumextent possible, from establishing uniform, national standards for itsprograms and activities and, when possible, will defer to the States toestablish such standards.  Under this criterion, HUD will set uniform, national standards only whereit determines, on the basis of all the facts of a given policy initiative,that such action is necessitated by factors such as the requirements ofFederal law, or that providing for variations in the statutory or regulatoryscheme is necessary to the achievement of some other Federal purpose. Theterm, ``standards,'' will be interpreted broadly, to include Federal programrequirements that States and their political jurisdictions must meet. (iii) <T3>Consultation. </T3>When HUD establishes uniform, national standardsunder this paragraph C.(5), it will consult with appropriate officialsand organizations representing the States in developing the standards.See the discussion of what constitutes ``consultation'' in section C.(3)(iv)of this Notice.<ITAG tagnum="81">D.

It should be noted that a finding that a policy initiative is inconsistentwith the Order's precepts does not (except as provided for proposed legislationby Section IV. of this Notice) automatically operate to prevent a proposalform proceeding forward. Instead, the initiative may proceed with internalHUD review, OMB analysis, and even implementation, in appropriate circumstances. (iii) <T3>Review by Secretary. </T3>(Section 6(b).)  The Secretary will personally consider Federalism Assessments at any decisionalpoint in the policy formulation and implementation process that the Secretarydeems appropriate, but no later than any step in the process at which asignificant decision is made to further the proposal's eventual implementation. Consistent with this guidance, the final point at which the Secretary willreview Federalism Assessments for each of the policy initiatives subjectto the Order, is as follows:  (A) <T3>Regulations and policy statements: </T3>Before the regulation or statementis sent to OMB for review under Executive Order 12291.  (B) <T3>Legislative comments and proposed legislation: </T3>Before the commentor proposal is transmitted to its intended recipent.  (C) <T3>Policy actions: </T3>At the final stage in the policy formulation andimplementation process at which a significant decision is made to furtherthe proposal's eventual implementation.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Federalism Impact Statement  </ITAG>Each regulation preamble, statement of policy, letter transmitting proposedlegislation or legislative comments, and other appropriate document expressingHUD policy will contain a ``Federalism Impact Statement.'' The ``Statement''will be similar to that currently required for the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1165 (1980) (<T3>codified at </T3>5 U.S.C. 601-612 (Supp. V 1981)). The ``Statement''will discuss the proposal's federalism impacts, irrespective of whetherthe proposal meets the Order's threshold of applicability under SectionII.B.(1) of this Notice. Its length, and the depth in which the federalismissues will be discussed, will depend on the number, complexity, and weightof the federalism issues involved.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. OMB Review</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Sections 6(c) and 7(b) of the Order.)In submissions to OMB under Executive Order 12291 and Circular A-19, HUDwill identify any proposed regulatory and statutory provision that containspolicies with federalism implications, will include any current FederalismAssessment prepared for the initiative under Section III.D.(2) of thisNotice, and will address any federalism concerns that HUD determines tobe substantial.IV. Special Requirements for Legislative Proposals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Section 5 of the Order.)<ITAG tagnum="81">A. In General  </ITAG>HUD will not transmit to Congress, formally or informally, proposed legislationthat meets any of the criteria of this Section. As noted in Section B.of this Notice, this section establishes a threshold for policy initiativescontained in proposed legislation, that operates irrespective of the ``federalismimplications'' involved. Proposals that do not pass this threshold maynot be transmitted to Congress.  Proposals that do meet this threshold are subject to further review undermain body of the Order. This conclusion is clear in the case of paragraphsB. and C. of this Section. Each of these provisions involves an ``up ordown'' determination. If the proposal passes applicable test, the Departmentonly knows that the initiatives does not have the offending characteristics;these provisions shed no light on the suitability of the proposal fromthe federalism perspective, and thus, must have their ``federalism implications''reviewed under the main body of the Order.  Paragraph D. of this Section involves a slightly different situation. Thisprovision not only indicates what may be proscribed_preemption of Statelaw_but also supports to estalish a test for determining what type of preemptionwill be acceptable_that which is consistent with the Fundamental FederalismPrinciples in Section III.B. and has a ``clearly legitimate national purpose.''As noted in greater detail below, this provision's test of acceptabilityis essentially the same as the requirement in section III.C.(3)(ii) ofthis Notice, that the policy action be ``necessitated by the presence ofa problem of national scope.''  The Department does not believe that a proposal that meets this test shouldbe exempted from further review of its ``federalism implications'' underthe Order. The provision's test focuses on a limited aspect of the proposal'sfederalism acceptability. It fails to address many of the other significantfeatures of the Order, including consultation with affected governmentalentities; limiting the preemption to the minimum necessary to achieve theFederal objective; giving States the greatest administrative discretionpossible; and refraining from establishing uniform, national standardsfor Federal programs. As noted earlier, the presence of some of these additionalprovisions in the preemption requirements of Section V. of this Noticelends support to the conclusion that that Section should be considereda ``complete system,'' separate and apart from the other elements of theOrder.  In this case, the Department believes that the <T3>absence </T3>of these additional provisions leads to the conclusionthat paragraph D. of this Section should be viewed as affording a ``firstcut'' at proposed preemptive legislation: An initial threshold that ifmet, depends upon the remainder of the Order to ensure its overall consistencywith the Order's precepts. Thus, proposed legislation that meets the thresholdunder any of the provisions of this Section is subject to further reviewand analysis under the main provisions of the Order.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Direct regulation of States  </ITAG>HUD may not directly regulate the States in ways that would interfere withfunctions essential to the States' separate and independent existence oroperate to directly displace the States' freedom to structure integraloperations in areas of traditional governmental functions.  The Department believes that the term, ``directly regulate,'' is best interpretedas reaching only instances of ``pure regulation'' of the States: <T3>viz., </T3>where the purpose and direct effect of the Federal actionis to control some aspect of State policy making, such as in the case ofthe wage and hour standards requirements under <T3>National League of Cities </T3>and <T3>Garcia. </T3>Thus, this provision will not affect the vast majorityof HUD policy initiatives that deal with benefit programs. As noted earlier,although benefit programs may impose conditions on their receipt and use,any such conditions_however significant_are merely an <T3>incident </T3>to achieving the purpose of the program involved, andcannot be said to be an attempt to ``directly regulate'' the State.  The types of ``direct regulation'' that Section 5(a) proscribes_that whichinterferes with essential State functions or displaces State policy makingprerogatives_is discussed more fully in Section III.A. of this Notice. It should be noted that if a policy initiative that falls within this paragraphB. involves the preemption of State law, the initiative must meet the thresholdsunder <T3>both </T3>this paragraph <T3>and </T3>paragraph D. of this Section.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Conditions on Assistance  </ITAG>HUD may not attach to its legislation proposals conditions that are notdirectly related to the purpose of the proposal.  The Order limits the coverage of this provision to ``grants.'' The Departmentbelieves that ``grants'' is unduly narrow. HUD administers a number ofprograms offering a wide range of ``assistance,'' such as grants, loans,loan guarantees, interest or rental assistance, and mortgage and loan insurance.The concern expressed in the Order_that any conditions be directly relatedto the policy initiative_is valid across all HUD programs. Therefore, inimplementing this provision, the limit on conditions will apply to allHUD legislative proposals, irrespective of the nature of the form of assistanceinvolved.  The Department will consider ``conditions'' broadly, to mean statutoryrequirements associated with a legislative proposal. In determining whethera condition is ``directly related'' to the proposal's purpose, the Departmentwill consider all the circumstances of the proposal, particularly the extentto which the condition has a direct and important effect on the proposal'sability to carry out one or more of its objectives.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Preemption. </ITAG>HUD may not preempt State law, unless (i) preemption is consistent withthe Fundamental Federalism Principles referred to in Section D. and AppendixA of this Notice, and (ii) a clearly legitimate national purpose, consistentwith the Federalism Policymaking Criteria described in Section E. of thisNotice, cannot otherwise be met. The Department believes that the requirement that a permissible preemptioninvolve a ``clearly legitimate national purpose that cannot otherwise bemet'' states a clear standard: the Department is to examine the purposeof the proposal and examine whether the preemption is necessary to itseffectuation. This requirement would apply to all types of proposed preemptions,whether they involved ``pure regulation'' or benefit programs. However, the meaning of the requirement that the ``national purpose'' be``consistent with'' the Federalism Policymaking Criteria is not entirelyclear. The only reference in the Criteria pertaining to national policiesis the ``problem of national scope'' requirement of Section III.C.(2)(ii)of this Notice. As noted in that Section, the Department believes thatthis requirement pertains to areas of ``pure regulation'' in which Federalaction is required to address a demonstrable, nation-wide problem thatthe States, acting alone or in concert, do not have, or cannot obtain,the legal capacity to handle effectively. To give full meaning to the ``national purpose'' language and the requirementfor consistency with the Federalism Policymaking Criteria, the Departmentwill use a two-part test. All proposed preemptions will have to demonstratethat they involve a clearly legitimate national purpose that cannot otherwisebe met. In addition, preemptions involving ``pure regulation'' will haveto meet the ``problem of national scope'' standard described above. V. Special Requirements for Preemption <ITAG tagnum="81">A. In general </ITAG>As noted above, this Section establishes a complete system for the reviewand analysis of preemptions of State law by Federal statutes and regulations.This Section operates independently from the remainder of the Order, andis the sole determinant of the suitability under the Order of any matterinvolving statutory or regulatory preemption. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Statutory preemption </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Section 4(a) of the Order.)To the extent permitted by law, HUD will construe (in regulations, legalopinions, and otherwise) a Federal statute to preempt State law only whenthe statute contains an express preemption provision or there is some otherfirm and palpable evidence compelling the conclusion that the Congressintended preemption of State law, or when the exercise of State authoritydirectly conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority under the Federalstatute. The doctrine of Federal preemption of State law recently summarized bythe United States Supreme Court, as follows: It is a familiar and well-established principle that the Supremacy Clause,U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, invalidates state laws that ``interfere with,or are contrary to'' federal law. <T3>Gibbons v. Ogden, </T3>9 Wheat. I, 211 (1824) (Marshall, C.J.). Underthe Supremacy Clause, federal law may supersede state law in several differentways. First, when acting within constitutional limits, Congress is empoweredto preempt state law by so stating in express terms. <T3>Jones v. Rath Packing Co., </T3>430 U.S. 519, 525 (1977). In the absenceof express pre-emptive language, Congress' intent to pre-empt all statelaw in a particular area may be inferred where the scheme of Federal regulationis sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that Congress``left no room'' for supplementary state regulation. <T3>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </T3>331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947). Pre-emptionof a whole field also will be inferred where the field is one in which``the federal interest is so dominant that the Federal system will be assumedto preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.'' <T3>Ibid; </T3>see <T3>Hines v. Davidowitz, </T3>312 U.S. 52 (1941). Even where Congress has not completely displaced state regulation in aspecific area, state law is nullified to the extent that it actually conflictswith Federal law. Such a conflict arises when ``compliance with both federaland state regulations is a physical impossibility,'' <T3>Florida Lime andamp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </T3>373 U.S. 132,142-143 (1963), or when state law ``stands as an obstacle to the accomplishmentand execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,'' <T3>Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, </T3>at 67. [<T3>Hillsborough County, Florida v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,</T3>471 U.S. 707, 712-13 (1985)]. Section 4(a) appears to track closely the Supreme Court's tests for determiningwhen a Federal statute may be interpreted as preempting State law. It shouldbe noted, however, that the Order's call for ``firm and palpable evidencecompelling the conclusion that Congress intended preemption of State law''seems somewhat more stringent than the Supreme Court's tests of when preemptionwill be inferred in the absence of express preempting language or a directconflict between the State and Federal law. As noted above, the SupremeCourt's tests for determining when preemption will be inferred are (1)``where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensiveto make <T3>reasonable the inference</T3> that Congress left no room'' for Stateregulation and (2) ``where the field is one in which the federal interestis so dominant that the federal system will be <T3>assumed</T3> to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.''(Emphasis added.) Both of these tests may be satisfied by a lesser degreeof intent to preempt than the Order's ``firm and palpable evidence'' test.In many cases, determining whether a preemption will be inferred underSection 4(a) of the Order and the Supreme Court's approach will yield thesame conclusion. Section 4(a)'s requirement for ``firm and palpable evidence''of congressional intent can be met by a Federal statutory provision thatcontains sufficiently strong evidence that Congress intended to ``leaveno room'' for State law or to preclude State regulation. In these cases,the analysis of legislative intent satisfies both the Supreme Court's testsand Section 4(a)'s ``firm and palpable evidence'' standard. There may wellbe circumstances, however, where a given proposed preemption may pass musterunder the Supreme Court's ``reasonable inference'' and ``assumed prohibitionof enforcement'' tests, but not meet the requirement for ``firm and palpableevidence.'' In administering Section 4(a) of the Order, the Department will considerthe ``firm and palpable evidence'' test not as creating a <T3>new standard</T3> for the preemption of State law, but rather as specifyingthe <T3>strength of congressional intent</T3> needed to justify a preemption.Thus, the Department will apply the ``firm and palpable'' evidence testto the Supreme Court's framework for determining whether a Federal statuteshould be considered preemptive. Specifically, the Department will inferpreemption where (1) the scheme of Federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensiveto provide firm and palpable evidence that Congress intended to leave noroom for State regulation or (2) the field is one in which the Federalinterest is sufficiently dominant to provide firm and palpable evidencethat Congress intended to preclude enforcement of State laws on the samesubject. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Regulatory Preemption </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Section 4(b) of the Order.) Where a Federal statute does not preempt State law, HUD will construe anyauthorization in the statute for the issuance of regulations as authorizingpreemption of State law by rule making only if the statute expressly authorizesissuance of preemptive regulations or there is some other firm and palpableevidence compelling the conclusion that the Congress intended to delegateto the Department the authority to issue regulations preempting State law.Current case law dealing with regulatory preemption requires a comparisonbetween State law and the Federal law being implemented by regulation,and a rational determination by the agency that the State law imposes anobstacle to the Federal objective, considered as a whole. In the wordsof <T3>Capital Cities Cable</T3> v. <T3>Crisp</T3>, 467 U.S. 691, 699 (1984), ``compliance with the State lawstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposesand objectives of Congress.'' (See also <T3>Fidelity Federal Savings and Loan</T3> v. <T3>de la Cuesta</T3>, 458 U.S. 141 (1982), the FHLBB ``due on sale'' case.)As in the case of statutory preemption under Section 4(a) of the Order,the Department interprets Section 4(b)'s reference to ``firm and palpableevidence compelling the conclusion that Congress intended to delegate ** * the authority to issue'' preemptive regulations, as requiring a higherstandard of intent for sanctioning regulatory preemption than that foundin case law. The Department will treat this issue in the same way as statutorypreemption (discussed in the preceding paragraph). Specifically, in determiningwhether grounds for regulatory preemption exist, the Department will considerwhether there is firm and palpable evidence that compliance with the Statelaw stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the fullpurposes and objectives of the Congress. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Minimum Preemption Necessary </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Section 4(c) of the Order.) Any regulatory preemption of State law will be limited to the minimum necessaryto achieve the objectives of the statute pursuant to which the regulationsare promulgated. This provision contains the classic ``minimum necessary to achieve ends''test. In making determinations under this provision, the Department willclosely examine all the circumstances surrounding the proposed preemption,including the objectives of the Federal statutory and regulatory provisions,the State provisions affected, the degree of Federal intrusion into theState law, and how the Federal regulation can be devised to minimize theeffect on State law. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Consultation </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Section 4(d) of the Order.) When HUD foresees the possibility of a conflict between State law and federallyprotected interests within its area of regulatory responsibility, HUD willconsult, to the extent practicable, with appropriate officials and organizationsrepresenting the States to avoid the conflict. HUD construes the phrase ``federally protected interests within [the agency's]area of regulatory responsibility'' as any legislative or regulatory proposalthat may have preemptive effect. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Notice and Opportunity For Participation </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Section 4(e) of the Order.) When HUD proposes to preempt State law through adjudication, or rule makingunder 24 CFR Part 10, HUD will, to the maximum extent practicable, provideall affected States notice and an opportunity for appropriate participationin the proceedings. For informal rule making, which makes up the vast majority of the Department'sregulatory activity, this requirement will generally involve publicationof the proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, with reasonable opportunity for affected Statesand others to provide written comment on the proposal. In appropriate cases,HUD may provide for alternative means of notifying affected parties andsecuring their participation in the process. In rule makings subject to this paragraph F., HUD will generally not proceedby interim rule or by final rule (without prior notice and opportunityfor participation), even where such proceedings would otherwise be justifiable.However, if the rule making involves an emergency matter, or congressional-,OMB-, or court-ordered deadlines that make advance notice and opportunityto comment impracticable, the Department will provide alternative meansof securing participation of interested parties in the proceeding to thegreatest extent possible, consistent with the circumstances involved.

The Order and this Notice are intended only to improve the internal managementof the Executive Branch, and are not intended to create any right or benefit,substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the UnitedStates, its agencies, its officers, or any person.

Fundamental Federalism Principles In formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications,Executive departments and agencies shall be guided by the following fundamentalfederalism principles: (a) Federalism is rooted in the knowledge that our political libertiesare best assured by limiting the size and scope of the national government.(b) The people of the United States created the national government whenthey delegated to it those enumerated government powers relating to mattersbeyond the competence of the individual States. All other sovereign powers,save those expressly prohibited the States by the Constitution, are reservedto the States or to the people. (c) The constitutional relationship among sovereign governments, Stateand national, is formalized in and protected by the Tenth Amendment tothe Constitution. (d) The people of the States are free, subject only to restrictions inthe Constitution itself or in constitutionally authorized Acts of Congress,to define the moral, political, and legal character of their lives. (e) In most areas of governmental concern, the States uniquely possessthe constitutional authority, the resources, and the competence to discernthe sentiments of the people and to govern accordingly. In Thomas Jefferson'swords, the States are ``the most competent administrations for our domesticconcerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies.'' (f) The nature of our constitutional system encourages a healthy diversityin the public policies adopted by the people of the several States accordingto their own conditions, needs, and desires. In the search for enlightenedpublic policy, individual States and communities are free to experimentwith a variety of approaches to public issues. (g) Acts of the national government_whether legislative, executive, orjudicial in nature_that exceed the enumerated powers of that governmentunder the Constitution violate the principle of federalism establishedby the Framers. (h) Policies of the national government should recognize the responsibilityof_and should encourage opportunities for_individuals, families, neighborhoods,local government, and private associations to achieve their personal, social,and economic objectives through cooperative effort. (i) In the absence of clear constitutional or statutory authority, thepresumption of sovereignty should rest with the individual States. Uncertaintiesregarding the legitimate authority of the national government should beresolved against regulation at the national level. <ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix B_Implementation of Executive Order 12612, Federalism </ITAG>Appendix B contains a form that should be filled out for each HUD policyinitiative that is subject to Executive Order 12612.
