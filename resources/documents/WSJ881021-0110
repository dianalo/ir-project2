Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A congressional subcommittee looking into the Ellis AG case of alleged insider trading recently issued subpoenas to about six banks and Wall Street brokerage firms.    Among the firms receiving the subpoenas were Dominick andamp; Dominick Inc. and L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co.    The subpoenas are separate from those sent out recently to several firms by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its own investigation of the Ellis matter. The SEC for years has been looking into suspicious trading through Ellis, a Zurich, Switzerland-based brokerage firm, in hundreds of takeover stocks in the early 1980s.    Unlike the SEC's subpoenas, those issued by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's investigations panel seek information not only about accounts but also about the behavior of brokerage firms during the early part of this decade.    &quot;One of the things the Ellis case is going to show is exactly what has been going on, from top management to the compliance departments to the registered representatives,&quot; said one investigator for the subcommittee, which is headed by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.). Late this year or early next year, the panel is expected to hold hearings at which it will look at the approximately 25 brokerage firms that did business with Ellis.    Investigators are particularly interested in the actions of Neil Sellin, a former stockbroker at L.F. Rothschild who handled the Ellis account for the firm in the early 1980s.    They said that despite repeated warnings from Rothschild's management, Mr. Sellin &quot;piggybacked&quot; Ellis's trading -- that is, traded in his own account in the stocks Ellis traded in. Mr. Sellin paid Ellis, which was his client, about $250,000 &quot;ostensibly for research,&quot; one investigator said. Rothschild was aware of some of the payments and participated in some of them, he said.    &quot;We've got internal memos where they're warning Sellin not to trade&quot; in imitation of Ellis, the investigator said. &quot;They tell Sellin the SEC is looking at insider trading, cracking down on this sort of thing, and he ought to be careful.&quot;    When asked in a telephone conversation earlier this year whether he &quot;piggybacked&quot; Ellis's trading in takeover stocks, Mr. Sellin said: &quot;I guess I bought some of them, as did Rothschild and other people at the firm.&quot;    Asked then if he had discussed Ellis's trades with risk arbitragers, or takeover speculators, outside Rothschild, he said: &quot;I don't know -- a couple, I guess.&quot; He added: &quot;If I did speak to other arbitragers, it was never to say anything more than I had a very smart guy who was on to something.&quot;    Mr. Sellin, who sources said asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions when quizzed years ago by the SEC, declined to be interviewed yesterday. He referred all questions to Richard Asche, a lawyer who has represented him in the past.    Mr. Asche said Mr. Sellin didn't discuss inside information with arbitragers or anyone else. He said Mr. Sellin had been questioned extensively by the SEC, but he declined to comment on whether the broker had invoked his right against self-incrimination.    Mr. Sellin now apparently is working at another New York brokerage firm.    Rothschild officials declined to comment. A lawyer for the firm said he believed some of the allegations concerning Rothschild's actions are untrue, but he declined to elaborate. Dominick officials have repeatedly declined to discuss the Ellis matter, citing the firm's policy of not speaking to the media. </TEXT></DOC>
