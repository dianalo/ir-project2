 More typical is ViewStar's expeience:Most customers are doing something they consider strategic and proprietary,and would prefer not to discuss it.andP;  Meanwhile, those who are willing to talkare doing pilot projects, trying the stuff out rather than buying thousandsof copies at a time.andM;ViewStar is a four-year-old company selling a server-based image-managementsystem (see Release 1.0, 88-3).andP;  It has 30 customers, more than 20 of them inthe Fortune 1000, including Arco, Procter andamp; Gamble and Texaco.andP;  Many of themhave engineering or design operations which have to keep track of drawings,plans, charts and diagrams not only to get their work done, but to prove thatthey are doing so to customers or interested parties from the government.andO;Furthermore, these companies must frequently share this information across avariety of locations, where small teams are building components of largersystems.andP;  Unfortunately, they don't like to talk.andM;But it's not just designers and engineers who shuffle paper.andP;  A mere subwayride from our office, Shearson Lehman Hutton faces an equally intransigentpaper explosion in its back office.andP;  Even though its information is seeminglyall-digital -- currencies, customers, amounts, dates, clearing houses,interest rates; not an engineering drawing or architectural schematic insight -- Shearson's back office is piled high with papers, despite networkedpcs (with terminal capabilities) on all the desks.andP;  Each of Shearson'sbusiness units generates a folderful of documentation a day: hundreds ofjournal entries, order tickets, wire transfers, cash sheets and other items.andO;While transactions are carried out on an IBM mainframe (which replaced anaging Burroughs machine two years ago), transaction files are downloaded into.dbf format for settlement of trades, analysis and reconciliation on anetwork of pcs.andP;  (The analysis applications are written not in Dbase but inClipper.)andM;Two years ago, the firm decided these back-office operations needed a bettersystem of record-keeping than paper files all over the place...and days ofdelay anytime something more than a month old was needed.andP;  Shearson's RickHopfer, first vp of systems development, took a look at the imaging systemsthen on the market, most notably FileNet, and decided in favor of ViewStar'simage-management system for one primary reason: It runs on pcs, so that hisusers could continue to do their work on systems they already had, and sothat all Shearson needed to buy was software and some optical disk systems.andM;The back-office system is just now being installed, with a goal of about 150users by this summer, up from 30 or 40 now.andP;  Hopfer had been excited aboutthe groupware possibilities: With ViewStar, you can annotate documents, routethem according to predetermined or dynamic paths, monitor completion ofcomponents of a group task, and so forth.andP;  In fact, most users are happilyusing only part of ViewStar's functionality, although the long-term planstill exists.andP;  Many of them want to do their jobs the old way, Hopfer says,and most aren't quite comfortable yet with the groupware aspects of thesystem.andP;  Second, the full ViewStar system runs only on pcs with 4MB or moreof memory and can take several minutes to load, an inconvenience when you'reswitching into other applications all the time to do the tasks you need thedocuments for.andP;  As Shearson gets better integration of its other applicationswithin OS/2 (through its own efforts and those of vendors), this problem willdiminish.andP;  For now, most users are working with ViewStar's Retrieve package,a subset which runs under Windows and simply lets them retrieve documents,without the annotation and group-interaction functions.andM;Slow sellandM;Shearson's approach might seem disappointingly low-tech given all the powerthat ViewStar could bring to bear.andP;  Hopfer and his team at first were aghastwhen they saw users printing out and distributing hard copies of the scanneddocuments, instead of mailing them.andP;  But they're learning to be patient.andO;Slowly, people are starting to want the more advanced features.andP;  &quot;It's betterif they sell each other,&quot; says Hopfer, &quot;than us coming down from above.&quot;andM;For now, the back-office system replaces paper, but does not manage the paperflow itself.andP;  Nonetheless, it saves users substantial time and anguish: Nowthey don't have to wait days for things to come from the warehouse, or huntthrough dog-eared files.andP;  Almost all the paper records they might use arescanned in.andP;  In addition, selected virtual printouts from the mainframe arestored in ASCII on optical disk, but displayed as print-out (thereby nevergoing through the paper step, but still looking familiar to users).andP;  Itemscan be searched for by title, and the ASCII printouts can also be searched asfull-text.andM;Eventually, the ViewStar system will be used to capture trading tickets andimages of physical securities.andP;  Ultimately, Hopfer points out, full use ofthe system depends on the legal status of image as opposed to paper copies;for now, scanned documents are sent to warehouses -- but at least they nownever need to be disturbed (barring a lawsuit or other such event), whereasbefore the warehouse was simply the ultimate in slow-access storage.andM;DetailsandM;ViewStar manages and shuffles papers, with facilities for indexing, markingup and annotating documents.andP;  It can display ASCII as print-outs, but itsvalue is its ability to handle images.andP;  Users with the full system cananootate documents; attach Post-It[.sup.tm]-like notes; link items in onedocument to others; circle, cross out or annotate individual items; or attachentire files.andP;  All these addenda are kept in separate layers; the original isunaltered.andP;  For example, you might want to attach supporting material for achange or append a note explaining the circumstances of a canceled trade.andO;Users can mail these to each other, or send them to a broader mailing list.andM;Developers can set up routing lists for documents or specify steps they mustgo through such as approval cycles; they use ViewStar's LISP-based scriptlanguage, which is fairly easy to learn once you get your mind aroundobject-oriented programming, says Shearson developed Marc Neer.andM;Currently, ViewStar resells Gupta Technologies' SQLBase server, whichmaintains a database about the documents and pointers to where they areactually stored on an optical or magnetic file server.andP;  The server software(without hardware) typically starts at about $50,000; prices per concurrentseat for the front-end drop from $500 for the first copy to $3000 for the100th copy.andP;  a full 100-user system, including image hardware but not pcs,would run about $1 million.andP;  Retrieve costs $2000 per concurrent user.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
