The full answer is not yet clear, but a new study by a World Bankeconomist concludes that for some countries, including Venezuela,the wealth was wasted.   Venezuela and its fellow OPEC members were the chiefbeneficiaries _ at least temporarily _ of the oil supply disruptionsof 1973 and 1979 that pushed prices from less than $2 a barrel tonearly $40. The immediate losers were the United States and otheroil-importing nations, which suffered a prolonged economic slump.   A decade after the last oil price shock that was triggered by the1979 Iranian revolution, economists and political scientists arestill trying to determine what happened to the mountains of oilincome earned by the exporters.   So, too, in a less academic way, are people in the slums ofCaracas, the Venezuelan capital. Riots that began there on Mondayclaimed at least 200 lives in a crisis triggered by new governmentausterity measures, including increases in gasoline prices andtransit fares. Martial law was imposed on Tuesday.   A few analysts have been saying for years that the oil exporters'wealth was squandered and that most members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries may be worse off today than beforethey began reaping the richest trade returns in history. But theirjudgments lacked a longer perspective on how the OPEC economies haveperformed.   Now, the World Bank's Alan Gelb, in his new book ``Oil Windfalls:Blessing or Curse?'' has provided a comprehensive and detailedanalysis of the oil boom fallout.   His conclusion: Most of the oil exporting nations are worse offnow than before the boom, making the decade of oil windfalls amassive net loss for the whole world.   The troubles for the oil exporters have been made much worse, ofcourse, by the steep fall in oil prices since 1986, from $30 abarrel to roughly $15 a barrel now. During the 1970s, it was widelybelieved worldwide that prices would keep rising.   Gelb, a senior financial economist at the World Bank, focuses onfive OPEC members: Venezuela, Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria andEcuador, plus non-OPEC member Trinidad and Tobago.   He says that of these six, only Indonesia succeeded in using its1970s oil wealth to strengthen its overall economy, mainly byimproving its agricultural sector.   Nigeria probably fared the worst, Gelb says. By the mid-1980s,Nigerians' overall standard of living was lower than before theboom, he concludes.   As a measure of Nigeria's failures, Gelb writes that in 1972-84,the economy grew at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent despitethe largest investment boom in the nation's history. By contrast, inthe six years prior to the 1973 oil price spiral, Nigerian economicgrowth averaged 9.2 percent a year.   Gelb adds, however, that despite the massive waste of oil incomeon such failed projects as steel factories, Nigeria did spend wiselyto improve primary education.   One of the chief reasons for the economic problems resulting fromthe oil boom in these six countries, Gelb says, was the speed atwhich oil wealth grew. In Indonesia, for example, oil export incomesoared more than fourfold at the start of the boom, from $641million in 1973 to $2.64 billion the following year.   The governments, which own the national oil monopolies, feltcompelled to spend the money rapidly in order to demonstrate totheir publics that it was not being hoarded or extorted, Gelb says.This often led to overly risky investments and too little attentionto the need for basic economic changes such as tax reform.   ``Oil exporters ended the period worse off than they would havebeen with a far lower, more predictable rate of increase in oilprices or, indeed, with constant real oil prices,'' Gelb writes.   Venezuela, unlike many of the other oil exporters, was morecautious in spending its oil windfall, perhaps out of respect forthe views of Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso, who helped create OPEC in1960. He once called oil ``the devil's excrement'' and said, ``Itbrings trouble.''   In the early years after the 1973 price boom, which was triggeredby the Arab oil embargo, the Venezuelan government created theVenezuelan Investment Fund to manage the money it saved abroad. By1978 the nation's accounts with the rest of the world were inbalance. Today its foreign debt of $33 billion is fourth largest inLatin America.   In 1979, at the start of the second oil boom, Venezuela's privateinvestment began to fall, in part because of what Gelb callsinconsistent government policies. Money began flowing out of thecountry. Subsidies fell. Unemployment grew.   ``The overall picture that emerges is one of a dramatic failureof economic policy under complex yet seemingly exceptionallyfavorable conditions,'' Gelb writes. ``Nothing appears to have beengained from the windfalls...''</TEXT></DOC>
