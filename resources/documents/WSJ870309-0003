A Labor Department report Friday showing an unexpectedly large increase in employment last month jarred the bond market. Prices of some actively traded U.S. Treasury bonds slumped nearly one point, or almost $10 for each $1,000 face amount, the largest setback in about a month.    The major surprise in the report was a vigorous increase of 337,000 in the number of workers on non-farm payrolls last month. That was nearly twice as large as most analysts had expected. The report also showed increases in manufacturing jobs and average weekly factory hours. Moreover, the civilian unemployment rate, which many analysts thought would rise slightly, remained unchanged at 6.7%.    &quot;These are very solid numbers,&quot; said Charles Lieberman, senior vice president and director of financial markets research at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. He said the report &quot;certainly takes the wind out of the sails of anyone&quot; who thought the economy would be so weak early this year that the Federal Reserve System would have to reduce interest rates.    The labor figures were so strong that some forecasters contend significantly higher rates loom ahead. &quot;The handwriting is on the wall: The economy is clearly and unmistakably accelerating, and the implication is higher interest rates over the rest of the year,&quot; said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;I also think inflationary pressures are mounting.&quot; He predicted that 30-year Treasury bond yields, now about 7 1/2%, will surge to 8 1/4% by midyear and around 9% by year's end.    Nevertheless, some analysts suspect the labor figures may overstate the economy's strength. They argue that several recent economic reports provide contradictory evidence, and thus it is still much too soon to expect a significantly stronger economic expansion.    For example, a survey of corporate purchasing managers, released a week ago by the National Association of Purchasing Management, indicated that the industrial economy continued to expand during February but at a markedly slower pace than in January.    Still, the Labor Department report, recent higher oil prices and the dollar's sharp drop in the foreign-exchange markets earlier this year have helped persuade many analysts to reevaluate their interest-rate forecasts.    Numerous forecasters now argue that rates are likely to hover around current levels for at least a few months. But many still predict that economic weakness abroad, especially in West Germany and Japan, will lead to lower world-wide borrowing costs later this year.    &quot;Over the last few months, I had been looking for rates to decline sometime between March and June,&quot; said Mr. Lieberman of Manufacturers Hanover. &quot;Now, I'm inclined to push it (his forecast of lower rates) out to May at the earliest, and more likely sometime this summer.&quot;    Late last year, Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., predicted the economy would slump in this year's first half at an annual rate of 2%, after adjusting for inflation. He was the only one of the 35 analysts in The Wall Street Journal's year-end survey to forecast a decline. He also predicted in the survey that 30-year Treasury bond yields would fall to 6.2% by mid-1987.    Mr. Yardeni said he abandoned his forecast of an economic slump about a month or so ago but that he still expects lower interest rates in coming months. The labor report last Friday was &quot;surprisingly strong, really very impressive,&quot; he said. &quot;But we have been getting such a mixed bag of indicators lately.&quot;    The economy is &quot;muddling along, neither booming nor busting,&quot; Mr. Yardeni said. &quot;And I believe we're going to need still lower interest rates just to keep the economy muddling along.&quot; He predicts that 30-year Treasury bond yields are likely to drop &quot;below 7% between now and midyear,&quot; adding that his earlier forecast of 6.2% still may come true.    A. Gary Shilling, a New York economic consultant, said he is &quot;really puzzled&quot; by the strength of the labor report. &quot;We are having trouble reconciling these figures with what we are hearing from our industrial clients,&quot; he said.    Mr. Shilling acknowledged that his forecast late last year of a 6 1/2% yield on 30-year Treasury bonds by mid-1987 may be overly optimistic. But he contended that it &quot;still is possible&quot; and that he remains confident rates will decline over the next few months. He and several other analysts said they doubt oil prices will rise any further. They also noted growing signs of fragility in the international financial system, notably Brazil's extraordinary economic and financial woes.    The bond market slump Friday wiped out gains registered earlier in the week, leaving prices of long-term Treasury bonds lower than they were a week earlier. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 7.95 points to wind up the week at 1426.90. That was the biggest drop since Feb. 10 and left the index about 1 1/2 points lower than at the close of trading Feb. 27, according to Peter A. Campbell of Shearson.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 fell Friday to 99 26/32 from 100 20/32 as the yield rose to 7.51% from 7.45%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 declined to 100 8/32 from 100 23/32, raising the yield to 7.21% from 7.15%.    Interest rates surged on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills rose to 5.63% bid from 5.5%, while the latest six-month Treasury bill rose to 5.65% bid from 5.52%. </TEXT></DOC>
