I came to celebratemy 48th birthday by being close to you and praying for your strengthand freedom. I will go home much older, much sadder and much wisethan when I began this journey four years ago.   I placed a bracelet with your name on the altar at Maaloula andprayed there for a healing of our personal wounds, and for thehealing of the wounds between our country and the countries of theMiddle East. I also prayed for peace for the people of Lebanon andfreedom for those who live in bondage as you do.   Your beautiful children are fine and send their love as so doesour family. Your many friends and thousands of people in Americawork and pray every hour, every day for strength and freedom for youand all the hostages.   I have sent messages of gratitude to Sheik Fadlallah andPresident (Hafez) Assad for their intense and complicated efforts tofree the hostages. Our country and others are working very hard tobring this situation to a happy ending. I have great hope thatPresident Bush will work for a new and better relationship betweenour people and our brothers in the Middle East.   Stay strong little brother _ this too will pass.   I love you,   Peggy.</TEXT></DOC>
