WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Public support for the presence ofU.S. troops is withering, but West Germany would lose more than $5billion a year if those forces were withdrawn, according to theGerman Economics Institute.   West Germany earns more than $5 billion each year from U.S.military expenditures in West Germany, after the costs of hostingthe troops are deducted, according to an institute report.   The institute warns of ``economic collapse'' in some regions ifthe troops are withdrawn.   An extensive analysis of the U.S. military presence wasundertaken because of the growing public tendency to see Americantroops as a burden, said Otto Vogel, director for economic andscientific affairs at the industry-supported institute.   ``We wanted to make an independent analysis of the costs andbenefits that would be useful to both those in the economic sectorand those in politics,'' Vogel said Friday.   As West Germans perceive a diminishing military threat from theSoviet Union, public support for the more than 250,000 U.S.soldiers stationed in West Germany has lessened.   The $5 billion figure represents only about 1 percent of thegross national product. But the study, based on official U.S. andWest German figures for defense and social spending, said that aU.S. withdrawal could trigger ``economic collapse'' inRhineland-Palatinate and Hesse states, as well as parts of Bavaria.Those regions have heavy concentrations of American troops.   Citing U.S. military expenditures in 1986, the institute saidWest German companies were awarded contracts worth $3.45 billion,and that another $1.3 billion was paid to the 171,000 West Germanemployees of U.S. defense installations that year.   U.S. soldiers also spend an average of 28 percent of theirsalaries on rent, goods and services in West Germany, whichaccounted for another $1.5 billion in 1986, the study said.   The analysis did not consider the presence of thousands ofAmerican civilians in West Germany in some NATO-related role.   On the cost side, the report said that in 1986, the West Germangovernment spent the equivalent of $991 million to host the U.S.soldiers, including $646 million in lost rent for land usedcost-free by the U.S. forces.   It also mentioned losses totaling $8.6 million for damage toprivate property caused by U.S. maneuvers.   The researchers said certain social costs of hosting the troopscould not be quantified, such as increased prostitution and druguse in areas with a heavy military presence.   Researchers Christian Thimann and Hartmut Bebermeyer also notedthat their report did not include public assistance costs forGerman wives divorced from U.S. soldiers or children left behind.   But they concluded that the U.S. military presence ``in 1986provided a material advantage of 12.5 billion marks.'' That wouldbe $5.39 billion at the exchange rate then in effect.   Vogel said his institute conducted the study to ``determine thefinancial facts'' amid changing political and social attitudestoward U.S. troops.   Asked whether the report would influence public opinion, hereplied: ``That's difficult to say. But certainly having availablean independent analysis of the economic considerations will havesome effect on the population's attitudes.''   Public resentment of the U.S. military presence, especiallylow-level flying exercises and war games, has intensified over thepast year.   The shift in opinion was most notable after the Aug. 28, 1988,disaster at the U.S. air base at Ramstein, where three Italian jetscollided during an aerobatic demonstration and fell in flames intothe crowd below. The accident claimed 70 lives.   There have also been suggestions in Congress that efforts to cutcosts with U.S. base closures be extended to Europe.   President Bush announced at the May 29-30 NATO summit inBrussels, Belgium, that the United States would offer to withdrawabout 30,000 soldiers from Europe as part of Vienna-basednegotiations with the Warsaw Pact on conventional force reductions.   But some observers believe pressure will mount for deeper cuts,or a full-fledged U.S. pullout, as relations between East and Westimprove.   Thomas Enders, a U.S. affairs expert with the German Society forForeign Policy, said he could ``imagine a situation, after asuccessful conclusion of the Vienna talks, when a significantlylower level of American troops would be appropriate.''   Edward Harper, a retired U.S. diplomat with long service in WestGermany, wrote in Thursday's International Herald Tribune that forU.S. troops in Europe, ``the time has come to go.''   ``The advantages of such a course are immense, including animmediate reduction in the federal budget deficit and acorresponding improvement to the balance of payments,'' Harperwrote.</TEXT></DOC>
