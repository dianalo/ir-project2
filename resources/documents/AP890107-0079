The most politically explosive charges, alleging a conspiracy todivert to Nicaraguan rebels $14 million in proceeds from U.S.-Iranarms sales, will be gone if the dismissal move by independentcounsel Lawrence E. Walsh succeeds.   But some experts say that would leave a ``lean and mean'' caseagainst North, free of problems that have bogged down theproceedings for months.   District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell will decide whether to grant thedismissal motion. If he does, prosecutors will still be able to trythe former National Security Council aide on 12 felony charges,including allegations that he shredded documents and lied both toCongress and a presidential inquiry in an effort to conceal hisinvolvement in the Iran-Contra affair.   ``The sex appeal part of this case is always the conspiracy,''said Washington attorney Stanley Brand. ``But there is still asubstantial case left.''   ``Lying to Congress and obstruction of justice are not smallmatters, if in fact that's what happened,'' said Brand, a formercounsel to the House of Representatives.   ``Lying to the Congress may be worse'' than actually divertingarms-sale proceeds to help the Contras at a time lawmakers hadbanned such assistance to the rebels, Brand said.   ``The public's perception of this and what it says about thedistribution of powers among the branches of government is asimportant to me as whether anybody goes to jail,'' he added.   The remaining counts carry prison terms totaling 60 years. Theyinclude charges that North lied to Congress in 1985 and 1986 abouthis involvement in the covert Contra resupply operation.   North also is accused of accepting installation of a $13,800security fence around his suburban Virginia home, pocketing at least$4,300 in travelers checks from Contra leader Adolfo Calero andillegally using a tax-exempt foundation to raise money for therebels.   Other counts charge that North lied to Attorney General EdwinMeese III and destroyed official documents during the Nov. 20-23,1986, presidential investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.   Since the indictment was returned March 16, a number of federalprosecutors have privately criticized Walsh for bringing a broadconspiracy charge against North and his three co-defendants.   These prosecutors questioned the wisdom of trying to criminalizethe conduct of North, former national security adviser John M.Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.   But many of these same prosecutors also supported the decision tocharge North with destroying documents and lying to Meese.   The Justice Department last fall filed a brief criticizing alegal theory Walsh used to support the conspiracy charge, saying itwould set a dangerous precedent for prosecuting government officialswhose conduct had not actually violated any laws.   Brand rejected this criticism of Walsh's use of the conspiracystatute, a popular law among federal prosecutors in other cases.   ``It was fine with those guys to use it against politicians whenthey thought it was in their interest,'' he said.   Walsh successfully defended the legality of the charges hebrought against North. Gesell refused to dismiss all but two of the16 original charges.   From the start, however, there was a problem about the conspiracyand theft charges.   North's defense against the charges _ that he thought he wasacting with President Reagan's permission _ hinged in part on highlysecret information about covert operations.   Gesell, meanwhile, stuck to his ruling that the prosecution mustdisclose more information than the Reagan administration wantedreleased in open court.   That prompted Walsh on Thursday to seek dismissal of the keycharges, a motion in all likelihood Gesell will grant at a hearingMonday.   Walsh's decision prompted charges that the Reagan administrationdeliberately held back releasing some secrets to help scuttle themajor charges against North.   But Attorney General Richard Thornburgh defended theadministration, noting that when Walsh informed him of the decisionthe independent counsel did not complain that the intelligenceagencies had treated him unfairly.   Reagan himself said Walsh's decision ``satisfies our problem,which has been concern.. about national security.''   North's lawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., said in a statement that``although the heart of its case is destroyed, the independentcounsel continues to toy with Col. North.''   Sullivan vowed to continue to press the secrecy issue on theremaining charges, stating that Walsh ``apparently refuses torecognize that classified information pervades the remaining chargesas well.''   But Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University law professor who hasdone some work for Walsh's office, said the secrecy problems will be``radically reduced'' once the conspiracy and theft charges aredismissed.   Walsh will have ``a lean and mean version of the prosecution,''Tribe said. ``With must of the most dramatic conspiracy and theftelements removed.. (Walsh) can proceed without the cloud of nationalsecurity'' hanging over the case.</TEXT></DOC>
