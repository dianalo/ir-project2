VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The leader of a group of former federal housingofficials says there was nothing wrong with using their connectionsto get millions of government dollars for apartment projects theywere developing.   ``Is it unethical for anybody who has been in government to usethe expertise they picked up?'' Philip Winn, now the U.S. ambassadorto Switzerland, asked following his testimony Thursday before acongressional panel. ``I don't see anything unethical.''   Winn, who was an assistant secretary of HUD for a year beforemaking an unsuccessful run for the 1982 GOP gubernatorial nominationin Colorado, led a group that won HUD funds for several projects inthe West and Southwest. In tax credits alone, those projects gotsome $29 million from the federal government.   Asked if he and his partners used their influence with the agencyto their advantage, Winn replied: ``It may very well be the case.''   ``I don't believe my partners willfully disregarded any rules orregulations,'' he added.   Among Winn's other partners were Silvio DeBartolomeis, formergeneral deputy assistant secretary for housing; J. Michael Queenan,the former director of HUD's Denver regional office; and LanceWilson, a former executive assistant to then-HUD Secretary SamuelPierce Jr.   Winn was greeted skeptically by members of the House GovernmentOperations subcommittee on employment and housing when he said norules were broken and that competition wasn't squelched.   ``If it is your purpose to show how that is not the way thingsworked, you have a tall order, Mr. Ambassador,'' said Rep. TomLantos, D-Calif., the subcommittee's chairman.   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., also criticized Winn: ``You'rereally out of touch.''   One of Winn's partners was Philip Abrams, who had been HUDundersecretary _ the second-highest post in the department.   Earlier, Abrams told the panel that his position at HUD _ whichhe likened to being vice president of the United States _ rarelygave him operational authority and that some of those functions hadbeen handled by Deborah Gore Dean, who followed Wilson as executiveassistant to Pierce.   In testimony before the panel, Ms. Dean has been identified timeand again as the key individual within the department whose supportwas needed to get increasingly scarce government funds to paydevelopers for fixing up and running housing projects for the poorand the elderly.   Her wide-ranging but unofficial authority, as well as Pierce'sdetached management of the department, have become focal points ofthe investigation into allegations of influence peddling at HUD.   When she appeared before the subcommittee a few weeks ago, Ms.Dean invoked her constitutional right against self-incrimination andrefused to testify. Pierce's testimony before the panel in May attimes became a shouting match as the former secretary tried todefend his role at the department and members of Congress accusedhim of trying to deflect blame.   Abrams testified that before leaving HUD in 1984, hisrelationship with Ms. Dean was cordial but became strained onoccasion.   He said it flared up ``on one occasion when she thought that Ihad sidestepped her.''   But he said they became more friendly after he quit thedepartment and went into partnership with Winn.   On two occasions in 1986, Abrams sent hand-written notes to Ms.Dean, both addressed ``Dear Debbie,'' seeking HUD funding forprojects in Oklahoma and Nevada. Both projects got the money.   The subcommittee on Thursday also heard from Joseph Strauss, aformer special assistant to Pierce who received $1.3 million inconsultant fees in connection with 13 moderate rehabilitationprojects.   After leaving HUD to go into private business, Strauss hiredformer Interior Secretary James Watt on a retainer to help get moneyfrom the department.   ``The reason was because of his access and his influence,''Strauss said of his decision to retain Watt. ``I don't want to makeany bones about that.''</TEXT></DOC>
