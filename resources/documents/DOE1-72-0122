For an accurate comparison between theoryand observations, it is desirable to determine the interstellar extinctionin situ and then correct the observations for it. Fortunately, Phi Casis very likely a member of the open cluster NGC 457. Five early B-typestars near the main-sequence turnoff in NGC 457 were observed at lowdispersion with the IUE satellite. In order to use the pair method toderive the extinction curve for NGC 457, a new method of choosing a lightlyreddened comparison star is developed. It consists of matching the equivalentwidths of spectral features that are particularly strong and sensitiveto temperature and luminosity. The UV extinction in NGC 457 deviatesfrom the average extinction for the Milky way and is uniform across thecluster. For the visible region, monochromatic fluxes of Phi Cas weredereddened with a mean extinction curve. Thus, the intrinsic energy distributionof Phi Cas was determined from 1500 to 5800 (Angstrom symbol).</TEXT></DOC>
