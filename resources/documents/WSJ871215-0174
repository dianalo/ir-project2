Social Security is a universal social insurance program protecting Americans regardless of age or income. All workers who contribute to Social Security participate in the program and are eligible for benefits upon retirement or disability. Also, their dependents receive benefits if they die or are disabled. Currently, 27% of Social Security beneficiaries are under 62 years of age. Of these, 3,300,000 are children.    Despite Haeworth Robertson's dire predictions, based upon dubious extensions of current health price trends, the Social Security Administration's actuaries and most others believe that the Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance trust funds will be in close actuarial balance for the next 75 years. Thus, Social Security will remain a dependable retirement income source for workers and their families. Instead of engendering conflict between workers and beneficiaries, as you suggest, the program will likely retain the tremendous popular support it enjoys today precisely because it serves the real needs of most American families.    Social Security's popularity across age groups reflects not only its universality but also the practical recognition of today's working population that without the program they could be responsible for their parents' support.    Social Security binds, not divides, generations. It has worked well for more than 52 years. It is stably financed. It serves to protect families throughout the life span. It is a disservice to suggest that this program be cut in order to mask deficits in the general fund that were caused by decisions that have nothing to do with Social Security.    Jack Carlson   American Association of Retired Persons    Washington   ---   Your editorial approaches but doesn't fully explain the peril that the economy is heir to if COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) clauses are allowed to continue in force in any area of economic life -- Social Security, union wage agreements or wherever.    COLAs constitute an insidious threat to the health of the nation's economy because they are positive feedback loops that drive inflation ever upward. There don't exist any counterbalancing negative feedback loops to damp out the effects of the COLAs. If COLAs are recognized for what they are, positive feedback loops that destabilize the economy by increasing the rate of inflation, then it will become politically feasible to take one small step toward reining in inflation, banning all COLAs. I don't think that this will cure inflation once and for all, but I do think that the removal of a source of such inflationary force is necessary before other sources can be recognized and controlled.
