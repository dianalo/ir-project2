Dukakis, who celebrated his 25th wedding anniversary Monday, wastraveling to California today. He was addressing the nationalconvention of the American Federation of State, County andMunicipal Employees, and aides said he would also meet with Jackson.   At a luncheon of national broadcast executives on Monday,Dukakis was asked about Bush's weekend criticism of theMassachusetts furlough policy, particularly a case in which aconvicted murderer escaped while on furlough and raped a Marylandwoman.   Dukakis said nearly all states have furlough programs and that16,000 federal inmates were granted furloughs last year. Thegovernor did not mention, however, that most states do not grantfurloughs to murderers.   ``They not only give them weekend furloughs, they give 30-dayfurloughs,'' Dukakis said of the federal system.   ``Ronald Reagan had a furlough program as governor ofCalifornia,'' he said.   Bob Gore, spokesman for the California Department ofCorrections, said then-Gov. Ronald Reagan terminated a workfurlough program after a convicted armed robber and a convictedforger on work furlough robbed a couple in Orange County in 1972,killing one of the robbery victims.   ``As a result, the program was terminated by the Reaganadministration and the deputy director in charge of the paroledivision was fired,'' Gore said.   Since then, Gore said, the only work furlough program forCalifornia inmates is part of the transition program for inmatesabout to be released, and is limited to those who have notcommitted violent crimes.   Bush, the vice president and likely Republican presidentialnominee, has been trying to portray Dukakis as soft on crime bypointing to the governor's opposition to the death penalty, andplaying up the furlough controversy.   Dukakis initially stood behind furloughs for those convicted ofmurder but later agreed to change it so inmates serving lifesentences would not be eligible.   On Monday he repeated his opposition to the death penalty, whichhe opposes on philosophical grounds, and said there was no evidencethat capital punishment was a deterrent to drug-related crime. Healso cited declines in his state in the crime rate and drug useamong students.   ``The proof of the pudding is in the eating,'' Dukakis said.``This is not an accident. I go to the people on this issue with arecord.''   Dukakis reiterated his plan to name a Cabinet-level drug czarand said Reagan administration anti-drug efforts have failedbecause of a lack of leadership from a committee Reagan named tocoordinate such programs.   ``There is nobody in charge,'' he said. ``There is nobodyaccountable. The chairman of the committee is (Attorney General) EdMeese. 'Nuff said.''   Dukakis was asked about how he would deal with supporters ofJesse Jackson who believe Jackson should be offered the No. 2 spoton the Democratic ticket.   ``I don't see that as a problem,'' he said. ``I think we aregoing to be very much together.''   He said he had the ``luxury of several weeks'' to select arunning mate before the Democratic National Convention in mid-Julyand that he would be ``looking at a large number of people.''</TEXT></DOC>
