By late yesterday, six major oil producers in the Gulf of Mexico -- Exxon Corp., Mobil Corp., Conoco Inc., Texaco Inc., Chevron Corp. and Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group -- had either evacuated their personnel from platforms in the northwestern sector of that body of water or limited output after a tropical depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, where most foreign oil imports are delivered, was also closed down.    The storm was expected to attain hurricane force and slam into the Texas coast near Galveston sometime today, weather experts said.    Crude-oil prices rose in anticipation of lost production, while gasoline prices climbed because of concern that refineries located along the coast could be damaged by the storm. Any loss of gasoline production would be critical because of heavy demand for that product during the summer driving season.    Reports that a radical Iranian group hanged a U.S. Marine officer when its demand for the release of a kidnapped Moslem cleric wasn't met shook the market as well. &quot;There was a flurry of buying when that news hit the wires,&quot; said Mary Haskins, a broker for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    Additional reports that a second U.S. hostage could meet a similar fate within 24 hours made traders question whether turmoil in the Mideast, where the bulk of the world's oil is produced, might again involve the U.S. Many strategists see this as President Bush's first real test in a crisis.    Crude oil for delivery during September rose 38 cents a barrel, to $18.31. Gasoline prices for August climbed 0.53 cent, to 53.48 cents a gallon. Heating oil for the same month increased by 0.44 cent to finish at 48.67 cents a gallon.    Yesterday's action reversed six consecutive days of falling prices. A barrel of crude oil declined in value by almost $2 during the past two weeks as it became apparent that production by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was exceeding the quota the cartel set at its meeting in June. &quot;The market has been hungering for bullish news,&quot; said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.    But most market strategists expect the rally to be short-lived. Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of Weather Services Corp. in Bedford, Mass., said that unless the storm intensifies sharply before it hits land, damage to offshore rigs shouldn't be serious. According to the weather patterns he sees, he predicts offshore workers could return to their rigs by late Wednesday.    &quot;Over the last few years, prices have tanked (fallen sharply) after every major storm,&quot; Mr. Rothman added.    For at least the next few weeks, Mr. Rothman sees an overabundant supply of crude oil. Preliminary figures for July, when OPEC members promised to comply with their new accord, show they have been pumping 21.5 million barrels of crude daily, two million more than the quota ceiling of 19.5 million. &quot;The demand just isn't there&quot; to absorb that output, he said.    In other U.S. commodity markets yesterday:    COPPER: Futures prices ended higher after trading over a range of five cents a pound. The September contract settled at $1.115 a pound, up 2.10 cents. At one point, September traded as low as $1.076 before recovering to the high of the day of $1.126. Weakness in the dollar and a recovery in precious metals also gave a positive tone to copper, one analyst said. The market became technically strong after reaching the day's low, the analyst said. Demand appeared when the September price fell to near $1.07 a pound, which was regarded as a key support point. A bigger-than-expected rise in London Metal Exchange inventories of copper contributed to early weakness, analysts said. LME supplies last week rose 5,275 tons to 73,150 tons. An increase of about 1,000 to 2,000 tons was expected. Another analyst said the continuing work stoppage at Highland Valley mines in British Columbia, a major Canadian producer, was becoming critical. If the walkout, which began July 9, isn't over by the end of this week, there could be a disruption of supplies and possibly a declaration of force majeure, he said. Force majeure is a contract clause that legally excuses a supplier if it fails to deliver sufficient quantities of materials because of factors beyond its control. But because both sides made some concessions in recent talks, the analyst said, a negotiator indicated there might be reason for at least one further session. A meeting is set for today.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose on a weaker dollar and increased tensions in the Middle East. Gold for August delivery was up $3.50 an ounce to $370.50, while September silver advanced 13 cents an ounce to $5.313. October platinum was $7.90 an ounce higher at $502.70. Silver was the star performer among the metals. The September contract, after dropping to a life-of-contract low of $5.135 an ounce Friday, declined further to $5.125 yesterday. But its decline lacked follow-through, triggering demand that brought about a recovery. In addition to technical demand and the easier dollar, the reported execution of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins by his Shiite captors created a market-supporting influence, analysts said. One analyst said a decline in interest rates as reflected by higher bond prices also helped the metals. But another said the dollar is the key to the precious-metals market, and because political tensions also tend to strengthen the U.S. currency, yesterday's dollar weakness might be short-lived.    GRAINS andamp; SOYBEANS: The prices of most corn and soybean futures contracts fell to life-of-contract lows during at least part of the trading session as heavier-than-expected weekend rains further raised the prospects of near-normal harvests this fall. &quot;It is a greenhouse out there,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago. &quot;On the whole, we have really ideal growing conditions.&quot; Because of recent rains, the price of some soybean futures contracts have touched new lows for five of the past six trading sessions. Some corn futures contracts have also set new life-of-contract low prices during four of the past six trading sessions. It isn't clear at what level prices will stabilize as traders grow more confident about the chances of normal harvests this fall. Futures prices have swung wildly all year on rainfall reports because the 1988 drought exhausted the supply of subsoil moisture that the soybean and corn crops draw on during dry spells. Some meteorologists expect more widespread rain over the Midwest later this week. The rainy forecasts overshadowed speculation that railroad workers in the Soviet Union might strike, which would disrupt that country's ability to import crops from the U.S.    COFFEE: Selling continued to depress futures prices. The September contract declined 3.03 cents a pound, to 78.99 cents. Since June 9, the September contract has fallen 46.91 cents a pound, or 37%, as producing and consuming nations in the International Coffee Organization have failed to reach a new pricing and export-controlling pact to replace the one that will expire Sept. 30. The decline was accelerated when the ICO suspended export quotas and created a free market early July. Since then, there has been a rush by many producing countries to sell as much coffee as they could, causing prices to tumble. One New York coffee importer and dealer says the situation could prompt new attempts to reach an international agreement and the reimposition of quotas. However, he said, &quot;There has been no effort on the part of major producing countries to encourage such talks.&quot; Representatives from Colombia, Brazil and Mexico met in Cartagena, Colombia, during the weekend, but there was no indication of whether the talks made any progress, the dealer said. One analyst said the market is vastly oversold but that while it is still under pressure from so much producer selling, technical factors haven't been able to take hold. A one-week meeting of the Council of the ICO is set to begin Sept. 25, but there isn't yet much expectation in the market that an agreement will be reached. Even if an accord is reached, an analyst said, it could be six months before implementing legislation is passed that would permit the U.S. to function as a member of the agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
