Catheterization failed in two elderly hypertensivemen because of tortuosity of their brachial arteries, and in one womanwhose aberrant right subclavian artery (SCA) prevented bilateral commoncarotid arterial (CCA) catheterizations. No complications occurred. One-hundredand ten ''excellent'' images were obtained by means of 118 injectionsfor the 24 patients. Iopamidol, the contrast medium, was diluted to 50% concentration with saline, then warmed to 37 deg C. Nearly all theinjections of both CCAs and right vertebral arteries (VAs) were completedusing 10 ml injections and a 5 ml/sec flow rate. The mean examinationtime for the three-vessel study was 29.4 minutes. Transbrachial selectiveIADSA thus proved to be a safe, useful, and relatively easy means ofdiagnosing cerebrovascular disease.</TEXT></DOC>
