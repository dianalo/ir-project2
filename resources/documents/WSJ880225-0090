Nelson and Thomas Kamm (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><IN> TNM FIN INS </IN><TEXT>   A Franco-Belgian consortium said it has gained control of Societe Generale de Belgique S.A., but the Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti vowed to keep fighting for an important role in the big Belgian holding company.    The consortium, led by the French holding company Cie. Financiere de Suez, said it holds 52% of Generale de Belgique's shares, though officials close to Mr. De Benedetti doubted whether the Franco-Belgian group really had the number of shares it claimed.    The group said it was open to discussing a cooperative arrangement with Mr. De Benedetti, and pledged that it would incorporate many of the changes that he had called for as it sought to develop Generale de Belgique into a Pan-European holding company.    Mr. De Benedetti's French investment arm, Cerus S.A., called the announcement by the Franco-Belgian group the last in a &quot;long series of declarations seeking to claim a fictitious majority.&quot; A Cerus official also said the companies in the new group had widely varying strategies and that Mr. De Benedetti could hope to eventually win some of them over to his side.    But Maurice Lippens, chairman of the Belgian insurer Groupe AG and spokesman for the Franco-Belgian group, said: &quot;Our 52% is a real 52%.&quot; The group is a &quot;solid majority, well locked in through agreements,&quot; which include a promise to offer shares to other members of the consortium before selling, he added.    The Franco-Belgian group includes key players in the traditional business establishments of both countries, who were said to share a dislike for Mr. De Benedetti and what they considered his aggressive methods. The group was determined to keep Mr. De Benedetti from his goal of taking management control of Generale de Belgique, which has extensive holdings throughout the Belgian economy and elsewhere in Europe.    Sources said it is likely that Generale de Belgique's chairman would be Belgian under the more-modern management structure that the new group has pledged to create.    Nonetheless, several analysts said the consortium, which combines a long list of partners with mainly financial interests, may find a pact with Mr. De Benedetti the best way to satisfy the need for an industrialist in the group.    &quot;Mr. De Benedetti is the man who can bring in the ideas they need to run the company,&quot; said one analyst. &quot;That will be their main motivation to bring him in.&quot;    Mr. Lippens said the group was open to participation by groups from other countries, &quot;and perhaps Mr. De Benedetti.&quot; The Groupe chairman said, &quot;Mr. De Benedetti has a lot on his side that can help us develop a financial and industrial project.&quot; But if Mr. De Benedetti doesn't join the Franco-Belgian project, he added, &quot;others can help us.&quot;    If Mr. De Benedetti elects to remain as a minority holder of Generale de Belgique, he could be a substantial nuisance. A Cerus official said Mr. De Benedetti and unidentified allies now hold 44% of the Belgian concern. That gives him what under Belgian law is called a blocking minority, or more than 25% of the shares, which would allow him to block some initiatives of the board, such as attempts to raise capital through new share issues.    A Brussels analyst said the new consortium technically could run the company against Mr. De Benedetti's blocking minority, but it would present problems. &quot;It will be very difficult to run the company against a shareholder as important as Mr. De Benedetti,&quot; said Patrick de Bellefroid of the stockbrokerage Puissant, Baeyens Poswick andamp; Cie.    But Patrick Ponsolle, managing director of Suez, said, &quot;A majority shareholder can ignore an important minority holder for years.&quot;    Suez, which holds 27% of Generale de Belgique in combination with its Banque Indosuez unit and the French water distributor Lyonnaise des Eaux, said it will reduce its current stake to parity with the Belgian members of the group, which now hold 16%. The Suez group said it hasn't found eventual buyers for the shares or determined the price.    Other French members of the consortium are Cie. Generale d'Electricite, with a 5% stake in Generale de Belgique, and a unit of the financial group Lazard Freres andamp; Cie., with a 4% stake.    The other members of the consortium and their shareholdings are Groupe with 3.8%, the brewery and holding company Artois Piedboeuf Interbrew with less than 1%, the insurance group Assurantie van Belgische Boerenbond with less than 1%, the mortgage bank IMOFO S.A. with 1.5%, the merchant bank Lessius with 1%, the holding company Nagelmackers with less than 1%, the Mecaniver affiliate of the French food group BSN with 1.5%., the Swiss holding company Electrowatt Group with more than 4%, and an unidentified syndicate of Luxembourg companies with about 5%.    Buying of Generale de Belgique's shares was still heavy on the Brussels stock exchange yesterday. The price soared 14%, to a record 6,100 Belgian francs ($172.41) a share, with 150,000 shares trading. The price is 52% above the 4,000 francs Mr. De Benedetti has offered for a further 15% of the company. </TEXT></DOC>
