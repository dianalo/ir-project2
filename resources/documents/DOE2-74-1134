For this purpose, an independent helicalcoil support is disposed for supporting the electromagnetic forces generatedin the helical coils. The helical coil support and the vacuum containerare connected by means of a rod-like connection mechanism. A movableslide rod not restricted with the axial direction is used as the connectionmechanism. (Yoshihara, H.).</TEXT></DOC>
