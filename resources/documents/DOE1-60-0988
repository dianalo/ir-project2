The effectof current operating conditions on future yields and on the life of thereformer catalyst was accounted for by formulating the optimization problemas a sequential decision making process. This formulation permitted theuse of dynamic programming as a solution technique. The study was ableto establish a constrained optimal operating policy for the process overone complete catalyst cycle. The optimal policy was shown to be $1.20per cubic meter of feed more profitable than the current operation. Overthe period of a year, this amounts to a savings of $350,000 per yearin each of Shell's two catalytic reformers in Sarnia. 9 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
