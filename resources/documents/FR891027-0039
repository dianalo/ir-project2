Notice of this redelegation was published in 53 FR40247 (October 14, 1988). The redelegation authority granted on October6, 1988, expires on September 30, 1989, and the Acting Administrator nowgives notice to extend that redelegation through September 30, 1990, butreduces the State Directors approval authority not to exceed $1,000,000(including principal, interest and other charges). All debt settlements/releaseof liability cases in excess of $1,000,000 must be submitted to the NationalOffice for approval by the Administrator. This action is taken to expeditethe processing of debt settlement applications/requests, of borrowers whoare unable to repay all of their FmHA debts. The effect of the extensionof the redelegation of the Administrator's authority is the continued expeditingof the administrative review process for debt settlements and releasesof liability permitting more timely debt relief to FmHA borrowers, andto correspondingly reduce the Agency's portfolio of inactive uncollectableaccounts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATES: </T2>October 1, 1989, through September 30, 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Thomas B.
