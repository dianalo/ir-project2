Background</ITAG>A. AuthorityUnder 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22, facilities may petition the Agency to removetheir wastes from hazardous waste control by excluding them from the listsof hazardous wastes contained in 40 CFR 261.31 and 260.32. To have theirwastes excluded, petitioners must show that a waste generated at theirfacility does not meet any of the criteria under which the waste was listed.See 40 CFR 260.22(a) and the background documents for the listed wastes.In addition, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984 requirethe Agency to consider factors (including additional constituents) otherthan those for which the waste was listed, if there is a reasonable basisto believe that such additional factors could cause the waste to be hazardous.Accordingly, a petitioner must demonstrate also that the waste does notexhibit any of the hazardous waste characteristics, (<T3>i.e., </T3>ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity, and EP toxicity),and present sufficient information for the Agency to determine whetherthe waste contains any other toxicants at hazardous levels. See 40 CFR260.22, 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and the background documents for the listedwastes. Although wastes which are ``delisted'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>excluded) have been evaluated to determine whether or notthey exhibit any of the characteristics of a hazardous waste, generatorsremain obligated to determine whether their waste remains non-hazardousbased on the hazardous waste characteristics.B. History of This RulemakingLederle Laboratories (Lederle), a Division of the American Cyanamid Company,located in Pearl River, New York, submitted its petition on March 27, 1981requesting an exclusion for its filter press sludge and wastewater influent.Lederle was granted a temporary exclusion on November 22, 1982 (47<T3> FR </T3>52677). Lederle subsequently withdrew its request to delistthe wastewater influent. On October 24, 1986, EPA proposed to exclude Lederle'sfilter press sludge and the compost derived from the sludge from hazardouswaste regulation (see 51 <T3>FR</T3> 37760). Because the Agency did not make a final decision onLederle's petition by November 8, 1986, pursuant to RCRA section 3001(f),Lederle's temporary exclusion expired on that date.During the comment period for the proposed rule, the Agency received arequest to extend the comment period to allow the commenter more time toreview the Agency's proposal to exclude Lederle's waste. The Agency grantedthe request, extending the comment period (which was to end on November3, 1986) to November 24, 1986. The decision to extend this comment periodwas published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (see 51 <T3>FR </T3>40343-40344) on November 6, 1986. Today's notice addressesthe comments received during the extended comment period and makes finalthe decision to grant the delisting petition for Lederle Laboratories.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Disposition of Delisting Petition</ITAG>A. Lederle Laboratories<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Proposed Exclusion</ITAG>Lederle Laboratories (Lederle), located in Pearl River, New York, producesvitamins, antibiotics, and other pharmaceutical products. Lederle petitionedthe Agency to exclude its wastewater treatment sludges (filter press sludgeand composted sludge) from classification as EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. F003and F005 based on the low concentration and immobilization of the listedconstituents in the wastes. The primary and secondary filter press sludgesare produced by Lederle's 1.5 million gallon per day Industrial Waste TreatmentPlant (IWP). The IWP produces a maximum of 20,640 cubic yards of filterpress sludge per year. This sludge is composted with leaves and lime usingthe windrow method. The composted sludge (also approximately 20,640 cubicyards) is permitted for use under New York State requirements (Case IIof 6NYCRR Part 360) which restrict such use to publicly owned land or landdedicated to a specific non-agricultural use, such as a golf course orindustrial park.In the proposed rule, EPA concluded that data submitted by Lederle substantiateits claim that the listed constituents of concern are essentially presentin an immobile form. Further more, additional data provided by Lederleindicate that no other hazardous constituents are present in the wastesat levels of regulatory concern, and that the wastes do not exhibit anyof the characteristics of hazardous waste. (See 51 <T3>FR</T3> 37760-37767, October 24, 1986, for a more detailed explanationof why EPA proposed to grant Lederle's petition.)<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Agency Response to Public Comments</ITAG>The Agency received comments from a single commenter during the extendedcomment period regarding its decision to grant an exclusion to Lederlefor the wastes identified in the petition. The comments received were oftwo varieties: (1) Those concerning the appropriateness of the verticaland horizontal spread (VHS) model and (2) those questioning the detectionlimits encountered in the sample analyses. The specific comments, groupedby these two issues, are addressed below.<T3>Comments Regarding Use of the VHS Model.</T3> The commenter statedthat using the VHS model for evaluating the composted sludge would be inappropriatesince the VHS model predicts the contamination potential for wastes disposedin a Subtitle D landfill. The commenter indicated that use of the compostedwaste as a soil amendment virtually would guarantee that individuals willcome into direct contact with the waste. The commenter identified threepathways for human exposure: Dermal absorption of organic constituents,inhalation of entrained particles, and ingestion. The commenter contendedthat total constituent analysis data should be used to evaluate the potentialhazard posed by the waste due to direct human contact.The Agency maintains that the VHS model should be used to evaluate Lederle'spetitioned waste because these excluded wastes could be disposed as non-hazardousin a Subtitle D landfill should the petitioner choose to do so. However,the Agency does agree with the commenter that other exposure routes maybe relevant for this petition and, therefore, alternate scenarios shouldbe explored. The results of the alternate exposure analyses are presentedbelow; the results of the VHS model analysis were presented in the proposedexclusion (51 <T3>FR </T3>37760). The VHS model analysis demonstrated that Lederle'sprimary filter press sludge, secondary filter press sludge, and compostedsludge do not pose a threat to human health through a ground-water exposurepathway. The results of the VHS model analysis will not be recapitulatedin this notice. The commenter also expressed concern that uninformed individuals wouldbe exposed to health-threatening levels of hazardous constituents. TheAgency disagrees with this contention because the results of the Agency'sanalysis of alternate exposure scenarios (<T3>i.e., </T3>ingestion, inhalation of suspended particles, and dermalabsorption of organic constituents) showed Lederle's waste to be non-hazardous.Additionally, the delisted composted sludge will continue to be subjectto state and local regulations regarding transport and use of industrialwastewater treatment sludge. In particular, Lederle's composted sludgewill continue to be regulated by the New York State Department of EnvironmentalConservation according to permit conditions for use and marketing of compostedsewage sludge (6NYCRR Part 360). A discussion of the Agency's analysisof the alternate routes of exposure is presented below. <T3>Analysis of Alternate Exposure Scenarios. </T3>In response to publiccomment, the Agency evaluated the alternate exposure pathways suggestedby the commenter (ingestion, inhalation of suspended particles, and dermalabsorption of organic constituents) in order to determine whether Lederle'scomposted waste poses a threat to human health. To perform these evaluations, the Agency identified the appropriate exposurescenario governing the three exposure pathways, the most exposed individual(MEI), and the basis used to assign values to particular exposure assumptions.The Agency attempted to assign reasonable worst-case values or typical-casevalues (where appropriate) to the factors in the equations used to assessthe three alternate exposure pathways. A value was assigned whenever theAgency identified a widely accepted value used in exposure assessments.For example, the Agency assigned a value of 23 cubic meters per day tothe respiratory volume factor used in the inhalation exposure equationdescribed in Section II.A.2.b; this is a widely accepted value.\1\<NOTE/> Numerous factors, however, did not have widely accepted values.Because each of the exposure scenarios used in the evaluation of Lederle'swaste had one or more factors that did not have widely accepted values,the Agency used a two-tiered strategy in the exposure assessment. Initially,overly conservative values were assigned to the exposure assumptions forany parameter in the exposure analysis equation for which a widely acceptedvalue could not be identified. This resulted in an unreasonably conservative(<T3>i.e., </T3>screening) analysis. If the waste passed the screening analysisfor an exposure pathway, then an in-depth analysis would not be requiredas the waste would clearly be non-hazardous. If the waste failed the screeninganalysis, a more reasoned analysis (<T3>i.e., </T3>where more reasonable values were assigned to each factorin the exposure equation) was pursued. The Agency believes that the two-tieredanalysis employed is appropriate for assessing the potential effects ofthe petitioner's composted waste. The Agency does not claim that the assumptionsused for this assessment are appropriate for all cases. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\International Commission on Radiological Protection, <T3>Report of the Task Group on Reference Man, </T3>New York: PergammonPress, October 1974, p. 346. In the following discussions of the exposure assessments, each assumptionis identified as being a typical-case or a reasonable, absolute, or impossiblewort-case assumption. These designations are specific to the exposure assessmentsof Lederle's waste. The overly conservative values chosen for the screeninganalysis represent absolute or impossible worst-case assumptions. Typical-case or reasonable worst-case assumptions were used when widelyaccepted values were available. An absolute worst-case assumption representsa value at the extreme end (<T3>i.e., </T3>most conservative with regard to protecting human health)of a range of possible values. Absolute values were used in the screeninganalysis where it was possible to identify an accepted range of valuesfor a factor. An impossible worst-case assumption represents a value soextreme that it is beyond the range of possible values. Impossible valueswere used where it was not possible to identify an accepted range of valuesfor a factor. For example, lacking a widely accepted reasonable worst-casevalue for the frequency of exposure to composted soil through an ingestionpathway, the Agency was confronted with a wide range of possible valuesdepending on the number of years a person would be expected to spend ata residence, the amount of time spent away from the home, and the numberof days a person could not ingest a given quantity of soil (<T3>e.g., </T3>because of illness). Rather than attempt to pinpoint theextreme end of the range of possible values, the Agency chose to assumethat a person would ingest compost bearing soil every day of his or herlife. Because a value assuming daily exposure over a 70-year lifespan isbeyond the range of possible values, it is labeled an impossible worst-caseassumption. The specific exposure assessmsent equations used to evaluate the threeroutes of exposure are presented below. (a) <T3>Ingestion. </T3>The Agency performed a screening analysis to determinewhether an ingestion exposure pathway warranted closer investigation. Theanalysis employed reasonable worst-case or typical-case assumptions whereappropriate and unreasonably conservative values (<T3>e.g., </T3>impossible assumptions) for those factors which lacked widelyaccepted standards. This combination of reasonable and unreasonable worst-caseassumptions resulted in an exposure assessment that is overly conservative.The petitioned waste passed this analysis for the ingestion pathway; therefore,the Agency concluded that ingestion of the composted sludge is not likelyto pose a threat to human health.To calculate the exposure rate due to the ingestion of the composted waste,the Agency used the following assumptions:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; A person would ingest 100 mg of soil per day.\2\<NOTE/> The choice of a 100 mg per day ingestion rate representsa typical-case assumption. The ingestion rate assumed by the Agency doesnot account for pica. A small fraction of children between the ages of2 and 6 years exhibit pica tendencies, consuming up to 5 grams of soilper day. The Agency has not assumed pica behavior because it is pathologicaland is not representative of the population at large. That is, a pica assumptionwould not be reasonable worst-case.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>Superfund Public Health Evaluation Manual, </T3>EPA-540/1-861060 (OSWERDirective 9285.4-1), October 1986, p.

This is anabsolute worst-case assumption.</ITAG>Using these assumptions, the Agency calculated the ingestion exposure ratesfor the EP toxic metals, nickel, cyanide, and the organic constituentsdetected in the composted sludge and filter press sludge. For example,the ingestion exposure rate for levels of arsenic in the composted sludge(reported as 8.6 mg/kg) was calculated as follows:<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">insert illus. 631</ITAG>The ingestion exposure rates for each of these constituents were then comparedwith the health-based levels used in delisting decision-making for eachconstituent. The regulatory levels were calculated from reference doses(RfDs), risk specific doses (RSDs), or maximum contaminant levels (MCLs).A 70 kg body weight was used to convert RfDs and RSDs to units of mg/day.A 2 liter per day water consumption rate was used to convert MCLs to unitsof mg/day. These levels are specific to an oral exposure route and, therefore,are appropriate to an ingestion exposure analysis.

These latter three compounds were detected in thefilter press sludge but not in the composted sludge. The exposure analysisequation was applied to the filter press concentrations of these constituentsto determine whether they would pose a health risk.The exposure rates for all of the constituents are well below the health-basedlevels. The screening analysis demonstrates that even using some unreasonableworst-case assumptions Lederle's waste does not pose a threat to humanhealth from an ingestion route, thereby obviating the need for a more in-depthanalysis.(b) <T3>Inhalation of Suspended Particles. </T3>The inhalation rate of fourconstituents (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and nickel) computed using thescreening analysis exceeded the health-based level indicating that thispathway warranted further investigation. Therefore, the Agency determinedit was necessary to perform a more in-depth analysis for this exposureroute. The Agency replaced the unreasonable worst-case or typical-caseassumptions used in the screening analysis with reasonable worst-case ortypical-case assumptions deemed appropriate for Lederle's disposal scenario.This more reasoned analysis indicated that exposure through inhalationof suspended, composted sludge waste particles is not likely to pose athreat to human health.The more reasoned analysis used the following assumptions to calculatethe exposure rate due to the inhalation of suspended particles:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The concentration of suspended particulate matter in airwas assumed to be 0.075 mg/m\3\. EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning andStandards indicated that 95 percent of the 2,044 sites monitored nationallyreported total suspended particulates (TSP) concentrations of 0.075 mg/m\3\or lower.\3\<NOTE/> The Agency, therefore, believes that this is a reasonableworst-case assumption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ EPA, <T3>National Air Quality and Emissions Trends Report 1986, </T3>EPA 450/4-88-001,February 1988, p. 3-6.<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The concentration of the hazardous constituents in the suspendedparticulate matter was assumed to be the same as the concentration of hazardousconstituents in the composted sludge.

This is an absoluteworst-case assumption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The fraction of inhaled particulates that would be absorbedinto the lungs would be 12.5 percent.

For example,the inhalation exposure rate for levels of arsenic in the composted sludge(reported as 8.6 mg/kg) was calculated as follows:<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus. 635</ITAG>These inhalation exposure rates were then compared with the health-basedlevel for each constituent.

The extremely low regulatory levels for arsenic, cadmium,chromium, and nickel derive from their higher carcinogenic potency froman inhalation route.

The reasonable worst-case analysis demonstrates that Lederle'swaste does not pose a threat to human health from an inhalation pathway.The Agency also determined whether the ingestion of hazardous constituentseliminated from the respiratory pathway (<T3>i.e., </T3>the 62.5 percent of inhaled particulates that are eliminatedand swallowed) would significantly impact the ingestion exposure analysis.These calculations indicated that, although the respiratory tract eliminationand subsequent ingestion of inhaled particulates would be 5 times greaterthan the amount absorbed into the lungs, the inhalation contribution tothe ingestion pathway would be insignificant (3 orders of magnitude lowerthan the amount directly ingested).(c) <T3>Dermal Absorption of Organic Constituents. </T3>The Agency performeda screening analysis to determine whether this exposure pathway warrantedcloser investigation. The analysis employed reasonable worst-case or typical-caseassumptions where available and unreasonably conservative values (<T3>e.g., </T3>impossible assumptions) for those factors which lacked widelyaccepted standards. This combination of reasonable and unreasonable worst-caseassumptions resulted in an exposure assessment that is overly conservative.The petitioned waste passed this analysis for the dermal absorption pathway;therefore, the Agency concluded that exposure through dermal absorptionvia handling the composted waste is not likely to pose a threat to humanhealth.The Agency calculated the daily intake of hazardous constituents throughdermal absorption using the following assumptions:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The overall daily contact rate would be 1.5 mg of soil percm2 of exposed skin.\7\<NOTE/> This is a reasonable worst-case assumption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The determination of an overall daily contact rate wassuggested by EPA, <T3>Risk Analysis of TCDD Contaminated Soil, </T3>p. 26, by using soilaccumulation results presented in ``Exposure to Lead by the Oral and PulmonaryRoutes of Children Living in the Vicinity of a Primary Lead Smelter,''Roels, Harry et al., Environmental Research, Vol. 22, pp. 81-94 (1980).<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The exposed surface area of an adult wearing a short-sleeved,open-necked shirt, pants, and shoes with no gloves or hat is 2,940 cm2.\8\<NOTE/> This is a typical-case assumption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The value cited was obtained from EPA, <T3>Risk Analysis of TCDD Contaminated Soil, </T3>p. 26.

For example, the dermal absorptionrate for levels of carbon disulfide in the composted sludge (reported as0.59 mg/kg) was calculated as follows:<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus. 639</ITAG>Dermal absorption rates were also calculated for phenol, toluene, and xylene(which were detected only in the filter press sludge) using total constituentanalysis data to determine whether these constituents might pose a threatto human health. These dermal absorption rates were then compared to thehealth-based level for each organic constituent. The health-based levelsare specific to an oral exposure route. Although standards for dermal exposurewould likely be much higher, the Agency has opted to use the more conservativeoral levels to be consistent with the premise that the screening analysisis an unreasonable worst-case analysis. The results of these analyses arepresented in Table 3.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s200,13.2,9.6,15</C><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>Exposure From Dermal Absorption</T4><H1>Constituents</H1><H1>Total constituent analyses (mg/kg)</H1><H1>Dermal absorption rate (mg/day)</H1><H1>Levels of regulatory concern \1\ (mg/day)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbon disulfide<D>0.59</D><D>2.6</D>andmultiply;10^3<D>7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">MIBK<D>0.6</D><D>2.7</D>andmultiply;10^3<D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenol<D>\2\ 11</D><D>4.9</D>andmultiply;10^2<D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene<D>\2\ 3.1</D><D>1.4</D>andmultiply;10^2<D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes<D>\2\ 1.3</D><D>5.7</D>andmultiply;10^3<D>100</D><F>\1\ See ``Docket Report on Health-Based Regulatory Levels and SolubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988, locatedin the RCRA public docket.</F><F>\2\ From total constituent analyses of the primary filter press sludge.</F></ITAG></ITAG>As shown in Table 3, exposure rates for these constituents are well belowthe health-based levels. Because the waste proved to be non-hazardous usingthis overly conservative approach, a more in-depth analysis was not required.In summary, the alternate exposure analyses demonstrate that Lederle'scomposted waste does not pose a threat to human health due to ingestion,inhalation, or dermal absorption of hazardous constituents.<T3>Evaluation of Lederle's Pre-compost Sludge. </T3>The composting processseeks to reduce the toxicity of the sludge using two mechanisms: Biologicaldegradation and dilution/stabilization. Biological degradation works toreduce the concentration of hazardous organic constituents. Dilution andmatrix stabilization effects from the mixing of soil and organic matter(leaves) with the filter press sludge work to reduce the concentrationsof both the organic and inorganic species. The composted sludge is, therefore,likely to have lower concentrations of the hazardous constituents presentin the filter press sludge. However, there is a possibility that thesemechanisms may fail to produce the expected reduction in toxic constituentconcentrations. A number of circumstances could result in hindered performanceof these mechanisms. For example, the microbes which break down the organicconstituents could die off during the winter months. The Agency investigatedthe impacts of a complete break down of these mechanisms using the samealternate exposure pathway analysis methodologies described above. Severalconstituents were detected in the primary or secondary filter press sludgeat higher concentrations than in the composted sludge and thus these levelswere subjected to the alternate exposure analyses used for the compostedsludge. The primary filter press sludge concentrations of three of theseconstituents (phenol, toluene, and xylene) were included in the originalanalyses of the composted sludge. The results of the alternate exposureanalyses for the remaining three compounds (chromium, mercury, and MIBK)detected at higher concentrations in the filter press sludges are presentedin Table 4. These results reflect the use of the higher filter press concentrationsas inputs to the exposure assessment equations; that is, the exposure analysesused are identical, except for the use of the filter press concentrationsin place of the composted sludge concentrations in the calculations.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Exposure Assuming Inadequate Composting</T4><H1>Constituents</H1><H1>Total constituent analyses (mg/kg)</H1><H1>Exposure rate (mg/day)</H1><H1>Levels of regulatory concern \1\ (mg/day)</H1>Ingestion:<ITAG tagnum="3">Chromium</ITAG><D>12</D><D>1.2</D>andmultiply;10^3<D>0.1</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Mercury</ITAG><D>0.96</D><D>1.0</D>andmultiply;10^4<D>0.004</D><ITAG tagnum="3">MIBK</ITAG><D>7.3</D><D>7.3</D>andmultiply;10^4<D>4</D>Inhalation:<ITAG tagnum="3">Chromium</ITAG><D>12</D><D>1.2</D>andmultiply;10^6<D>1.9</D>andmultiply;10^6<ITAG tagnum="3">Mercury</ITAG><D>0.96</D><D>9.5</D>andmultiply;10^8<D>0.004</D><ITAG tagnum="3">MIBK</ITAG><D>7.3</D><D>7.2</D>andmultiply;10^7<D>4</D>Dermal absorption:<ITAG tagnum="3">MIBK</ITAG><D>7.3</D><D>3.2</D>andmultiply;10^2<D>4</D><F>\1\ For all health-based levels except the inhalation level for chromium,see ``Docket Report on Health-Based Regulatory Levels and SolubilitiesUsed in the Evaluation of Delisting Petitions,'' June 8, 1988, locatedin the RCRA public docket.

The commenter statedthat the detection limits presented in Table 4 (51 <T3>FR</T3> 37766) of the proposed exclusion were unusually high. The commenteralso stated that the Agency did not provide the detection limits associatedwith the analysis for priority pollutants in the composted sludge.The Agency believes that the test methods employed and detection limitsencountered in the analysis of Lederle's waste are appropriate and acceptablefor Lederle's waste matrix. Consistent with requirements for delistingpetitions, the analytical methods used derive from the EPA document entitled<T3>Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste</T3> (SW-846). The detectionlimits associated with the composted sludge analysis were 7.6 to 16 ppmfor base/neutral extractables (Method 8270), 1.7 to 16 ppm for acid extractables(Method 8270), 1.7 to 16 ppm for acid extractables (Method 8270), 0.1 to0.4 ppm for pesticides (Method 8080), and 0.5 ppm for purgeables (Method8240). The vegetable matter and oil and grease content of the compostedsludge contributed to the relatively high detection limits encountered.The presence of a number of aliphatic compounds in the composted sludgesamples (documented in the spot-check report: ERCO/Energy Resources Co.,Inc., Sampling Mission andplusmin;3, Lederle Laboratories, Pearl River NY,Draft Report, February 1984) resulted in chromatographic baseline elevation,making analyses of the GC results more difficult and increasing detectionlimits. That is, pure extract could not be run through the column becausecertain compounds were present at concentrations which could damage thecolumn; the extract was diluted and the extract/diluent mixture was injectedinto the column. The amount of diluent necessary varied according to theconcentration of the compounds that could damage the column and the detectionlimits increased proportionally with the rate of dilution. As expected,the detection limits varied between samples collected from the filter pressand the compost pile and were higher than what would be expected from ``clean''wastes. The Agency is not indicating that these limits are appropriatedetection limits for all petitioners, but for Lederle's particular wastematrix these limits are adequate.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Final Agency Decision</ITAG>For the reasons stated in the proposal and the responses to public comment,the Agency believes that the filter press sludge and the composted sludgeare non-hazardous and as such should be excluded from hazardous waste control.The Agency, therefore, is granting a final exclusion to Lederle Laboratoriesfor its wastewater treatment sludges (EPA Hazardous Waste Nos. F003 andF005) generated at Lederle's Pearl River, New York facility. The exclusionremains in effect unless the wastes vary from those originally describedin the petition (<T3>i.e., </T3>the wastes are altered as a result of changes in the manufacturingor treatment processes).Delisted wastes must be managed in accordance with the same applicableFederal and State regulations as other industrial non-hazardous wastes.Therefore, when the Agency delists a petitioned waste, the generator ofthe waste must either treat, store, or dispose of the waste in an on-siteor an off-site storage, treatment, or disposal facility, either of whichcomplies with State regulations for permitting, licensing, and managementof municipal or industrial solid waste. Alternatively, a delisted wastemay be delivered to a facility which beneficially uses or reuses, or legitimatelyrecycles or reclaims the waste; or treats the waste prior to such beneficialuse, reuse, recycling, or reclamation.In Lederle's case, State regulations (6NYCRR Part 360) permit restricteduse of composted sludge as a soil amendment. The New York State Departmentof Environmental Conservation will continue to regulate the delisted wasteunder Case II of Part 360 which specifies that the compost (a) must notbe available to the general public, (b) must be used to establish finalvegetative cover on a landfill or other publicly-owned lands dedicatedto non-agricultural uses, (c) will be tested to determine whether metalsconcentrations render the compost unsuitable for land application, and(d) must be applied in accordance with the ``Solid Waste Management FacilitiesGuidelines'' on land application with regard to site separation distances(500 feet from the nearest private residence) and application practices(application rates not to exceed vegetation nutrient requirements). Thus,Lederle's waste management practices must comply with the stipulationspresented in the preceding paragraph.While the State of New York provides a mechanism for Lederle's distributionof their composted sludge, other states are not obliged to do so. If Lederle'scomposted sludge is transported outside the State of New York, the wastewill be subject to appropriate state and local regulations regarding thetransport and use of industrial wastewater treatment sludge. For example,if the waste were transported to New Jersey for disposal, the facilitywould be required to obtain a NJPDES permit which similarly restricts disposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Limited Effect of Federal Exclusion</ITAG>The final exclusion being granted today is being issued under the Federal(RCRA) delisting program. States, however, are allowed to impose theirown, non-RCRA, regulatory requirements that are more stringent than EPA'spursuant to section 3009 of RCRA. These more stringent requirements mayinclude a provision that prohibits a Federally issued exclusion from takingeffect in the State. Since a petitioner's waste may be regulated undera dual system (<T3>i.e.,</T3> both Federal (RCRA) and State (non-RCRA) programs), petitionersare urged to contact their State regulatory authority to determine theregulatory status of their wastes under State law.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Effective Date</ITAG>This rule is effective immediately. Although Subtitle C regulations normallytake effect six months after promulgation (RCRA section 3010(b)), the Hazardousand Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allowrules to become effective in less than six months when the regulated communitydoes not need the six-month period to come into compliance. That is thecase here since this rule reduces, rather than increases, the existingrequirements for persons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessaryhardship and expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effectivedate six months after promulgation, and the fact that a six-month deadlineis not necessary to achieve the purpose of Section 3010, EPA believes thatthis exclusion should be effective immediately. These reasons also providea basis for making this rule effective immediately under the AdministrativeProcedures Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and, therefore, subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This grant of exclusion is not major since its effect is to reduce theoverall costs and economic impact of EPA's hazardous waste management regulations.This reduction is achieved by excluding wastes generated at a specificfacility from EPA's lists of hazardous wastes, thereby enabling this facilityto treat its wastes as non-hazardous. There is no additional impact, therefore,due to today's rule. This rule is not a major regulation, therefore, noRegulatory Impact Analysis is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran Agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e.,</T3> small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, that the rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. This amendment will not have a adverse economic impact on small entitiessince its effects will be to reduce the overall costs of EPA's hazardouswaste regulations. Accordingly, I hereby certify that this final regulationwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261 </ITAG>Hazardous materials, Waste treatment and disposal, Recycling.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Sec. 3001 RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6921.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 25, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffery D.
