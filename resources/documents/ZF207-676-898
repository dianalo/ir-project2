C-2 mini-supercomputer in 1986 for its research in solid-state physicsand surface science.andM;Brian W. Davies, director of computing at the Ruterhford Appleton Laboratoryat the council's Atlas Center in Oxford, said the C-2 is used as a centralcomputing resource.andP;  However, he predicted that mini-supers will serve asdepartmental machines for small numbers of scientists and engineers, ratherthan as remote central facilities.andM;Competition for mini-supercomputers comes from above and below, Davies said.andO;&quot;From above, there is the possibility that supercomputer manufacturers willproduce less powerful versions of their flagship machines.andP;  From below, thereis pressure from powerful workstations that are moving steadily into thelower end of the performance range of mini-supers.&quot;andM;The Rutherford Appleton lab runs supercomputing training courses for itsusers.andP;  In partnership with the lab, IBM Corp. plans to set up a new centerfor an IBM 3090 600E with six vector facilities.andP;  The center will investigatethe feasibility of IBM Supercomputing to support fundamental research by theScience Engineering Research Council (SERC).andM;&quot;The basic question is to find the best ways of visualizing the vastquantities of data from supercomputer simulation and modeling runs,&quot; Daviessaid.andP;  &quot;People want to see picture and movies, not printout, and they usuallywant to receive them via a network to their institutes, not by visiting thesupercomputer center.&quot;andM;Designed for CompitabilityandM;He characterized mini-supers as offering about one-tent the power of asupercomputer for about one-tenth the price; many are designed forcompiability with supercomputers so that users can move from one machine toanother.andM;Alan Robiette, computing director at Oxford University, which just bought aConvex C-1, said the mini-super vs.andP;  VAX battle is not as cut-and-dired aseither side makes out.andP;  &quot;I am skeptical that mini-supers will replace VAXes,&quot;Robiette said.andM;Oxford users can link their VAXes and C-1 to a Cray supercomputer viaEthernet or DECnet.andM;Oxford's C-1 is part of a large nationwide network including a Cyber 205 inManchester, Amdahl vector processors and Crays in London and Oxford, andterminals linked by Gandalf data switchs and fiber optics in every universitylaboratory, in addition to many VAXes.andM;The universityhs general-purpose computing is done on a large VAXcluster.andM;&quot;Individual data and voice cables are run in parallel around the universitybuildings so every telephone locations is a potential data connection,&quot;Robiette said.andM;When Oxford was upgrading one of its supercomputers to a Cray X-MP 48, it wasdecided that some of the calculations should be kept at a local level.andP;  &quot;Wewanted a bridge between our DEC minis and the supercomputer centers,&quot;Robiette said.andP;  He chose Convex because of its compatibility with DECsystems, particularly its version of FORTRAN.andM;SERC also granted Exeter University $264,000 to purchase a Convex system forprograms that eventually could be used on a remote Cray X/MP supercomputer atthe Rutherford Appleton lab.andM;Convex was chosen because it had a suite of protocol modules supporting theacademic worldhs joint network standards for data communications.andP;  Userswould be able to develop, check and optimize code on the Convex, then sendbig jobs off to the Cray for batch processing.andM;Applications on the Convex include calculating the electronic properties andstrnegths of different materials.andP;  Software was developed for solid statephysics, chemistry and biophysics to calculate the energy of individual atomsin clusters of atoms.andM;Users typically access the mini-super via terminals, usually micros connectedover Ethernet.andM;The Cray and Convex are similar enough that Fortran code developed on theConvex will run well on the Cray, but users have gone to enormous trouble tooptimize their code.andP;  The result, according to Bob Jones of Exeter'sdepartment of theoretical physics, could be a twenty-fivefold improvement inperformance.andM;Jones said he does not think mini-supers will be an important computingresource for the theoretical physicists.andP;  &quot;their strength lies in being ableto develop code that will run efficiently on supercomputers,&quot; he said.andM;Peter Ward, head of research and development at the government's StructuralDynamics Research Company (SDRC), which develops finite-element analysissoftware in Hitchin, hertfordshire, also uses a Convex C-1.andM;SDRC is preparing a version of its I-deas software to run on workstationsnetworked to the Convex.andM;&quot;People in the engineering field are interested in mini-supers -- users whonormally would be looking at the DEC VAX 8000 range.andP;  Basically, you get moreperformance for the same price,c Ward said.andM;SDRC became involved with Convex when it was looking for high floating-pointperformance.andP;  The Convex handles compute-intensive analysis of models, whilethe graphics side of building up the models is done on networkedworkstations.andM;SDRC has been using vectorizing compilers that pick out parts of code thatcan be vectorized and tell the user what parts have to be restructured byhand.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
