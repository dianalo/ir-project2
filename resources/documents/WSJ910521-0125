Analysts had expected Apple to reduce its payroll and totake other actions aimed at boosting sagging profits, whichhave been a victim of the computer maker's successful switchfrom being a high-priced vendor to a low-priced one.</LP><TEXT>   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Apple fell $2.625to $44.25 on volume of more than 2.3 million shares.   Apple was chary with details about the restructuring. Thecompany said only that cuts in operating expenses, includingthe firing of roughly 1,500 of its 15,600 employees, wouldtake place over the next 12 months and that the company willtake a charge in the third quarter ended June 28. Appledeclined to indicate the costs of the restructuring, but saidthat most of the layoffs will occur in the quarter.   Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst at Hambrecht andamp; Quist, estimatedApple would take a charge of $45 million. Such a charge wouldwipe out about 40% of Apple's expected profit for thequarter, which had been estimated at about $110 million. Mr.Lupatkin also expects Apple to shave $300 million from annualoperating expenses of more than $5 billion.   Since the end of September, Apple has added 1,000 workersto its payroll, mainly in the areas of product developmentand manufacturing. Now the company is looking at cutting aneven greater number of employees, though mostly in otherareas.   The seeds of Apple's financial restructuring were sown inOctober when the company replaced much of its product linewith new computer models offered at roughly half of the priceof earlier models. Apple's action reflected concern for itsdwindling share -- then less than 10% -- of the stagnantworld-wide personal computer market. Customers have respondedenthusiastically, roughly doubling Apple's market share.   But, at least in the short run, Apple is a victim of itsown success. Apple disclosed May 1 that the shift tolower-priced computers occurred more quickly than itexpected, leading to a profit erosion.   John Sculley, chief executive officer, believes the stockmarket -- which has sent the stock down from $70 in the pastmonth -- has overreacted. But he agrees that Apple needs toinstall a new financial model if it is to stick with lowerprices and pursue new opportunities in consumer markets,where prices on electronic goods are generally well belowthose set for computers.</TEXT></DOC>
