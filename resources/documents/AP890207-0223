More than a third of the country's 15 million Pathans, Tajiks andpeople of other tribes have fled to Pakistan and Iran as fightingcontinues between forces of the communist government and Moslemguerrillas.   Much of the country's agricultural-based economy is in ruins. Itsroads are lined with wrecked implements of war. Its lunar landscaperemains littered with mines.   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, which seizedpower in a 1978 military coup, still sits in Kabul but its mainlyconscripted army has only tenuous control of the cities.   The mujahedeen (Islamic ``holy warriors'') claim to hold 90percent of the countryside.   Their stated goal is to rout the communists and establish anIslamic republic of Afghanistan but their myriad factions havefailed repeated attempts to forge a united political front.   ``It shows the futility of military solutions,'' said SovietForeign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on a recent visit to Pakistanwhich, in addition to the United States, has backed the guerrillasfor a decade.   In human terms, the cost is estimated at more than 1 millionAfghan and 15,000 Soviet war dead.   It was the Marxist coup which set off the civil war. Soviettroops and armor intervened in December 1979 to replace onepro-Moscow government with another but the Moslem insurgency onlyintensified.   Afghanistan's President Najib, who uses only one name and hasshortened it from Najibullah, insists that his forces can holdKabul, the capital, without the Red Army's help.   However, the mujahedeen claim his army is demoralized and thatseveral of its leaders are bargaining to surrender.   Even Najib's own party is divided from within between his urbanParcham (Banner) wing and the Khalq (Masses) faction, whichpredominates the military.   Western diplomats speculate that a great deal of terroristbombings and gunfire in Kabul are related to this factionalism andnot to the war with mujahedeen.   United Nations officials say Afghanistan will need massivereconstruction once the fighting stops. No one has been able topredict when.   Many of the country's once thriving orchards, cottonfields andvinyards have been destroyed by Soviet-Afghan carpet bombing or havegrown wild for lack of care, according to U.N. estimates.   Its mineral mining industry is damaged or lies idle for lack oftrained workers. Most of them either are fighting the war, living asrefugees or are dead.   The United Nations is planning a $1.1 billion relief andrecontruction project named Operation Salaam, which means ``peace''in Arabic. Officials say they can't begin the gargantuan task untilfighting in Afghanistan stops.   ``This is a very crucial time and we have to give peace achance,'' said Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan, the U.N. Specialcoordinator of the project, who has been shuttling betweenIslamabad, Kabul and Moscow to oversee the logistics.   The organization's High Commissionerate for Refugees haspredicted that the repatriation of more than 3 million Afghanrefugees from Pakistan and 2 million from Iran will be the biggesthuman transmigration in U.N. History.   Even if peace lures the refugees home, millions of landmines andsmaller, explosive booby traps await them.   Teams from the United States, France and Turkey already havebegun visiting refugee camps along Pakistan's Frontier to teach theAfghans how to identify the devices and defuse them.   Exacerbating the Afghans' suffering has been one of the worstwinters in recent memory. Snow and mujahedeen attacks on supplyconvoys have left Kabul and other Afghan cities desparately short offood and fuel.   The first stage of Operation Salaam is an airlift of food,blankets and medicines.   Mujahedeen factions, though organized in the field, have failedto unite in a political front that can form an alternative to theKabul government.   The seven most powerful groups are Sunni Moslems and comprise theloose, seven-party Islamic Unity of Afghan Mujahedeen headquarteredin Peshawar, Pakistan.   At least eight other, smaller groups are Shiite Moslems andoperate from Iran.   The two sides frequently have traded gunfire during the war, ashave the component parties of the two alliances. All profess adesire to form an Islamic government but personal rivalries amongthe rebel leaders appear to be the biggest obstacle.   It reflects Afghanistan's history as a feudal society ruled bytribal leaders and local warlords who for centuries spurned thenotion of centralized government.   ``This entire war has been one of partiality. That has notchanged,'' said Hamed Karzai, a spokesman of the Pakistan-basedrebel alliance. ``We are Moslems, but very peculiar Moslems.''   The war nudged Pakistan closer to Washington as the pipeline forU.S. arms to the mujahedeen. It helped distract theDemocrat-controlled Congress in Washington from the issue ofPakistan's nuclear program, which some suspect is developing or hasdeveloped nuclear weapons, and over to generous military andeconomic aid treaties with Islamabad.   ``Let's face it, Pakistan has become a good friend in a part ofthe world where we don't have many,'' said U.S. Ambassador ArnoldRaphel before he wa killed last year.   Raphel was returning to Islamabad with President Mohammad Ziaul-Haq and most of his top generals from a demonstration of the U.S.M-1 Abrams tank in August when their Pakistani air force planecrashed, killing all 30 people aboard.   Investigators said the wreckage indicated sabotage. Pakistaniofficials privately said the top suspects were Moscow and Kabul inan alleged plot to eliminate the mujahedeen's staunchest patron.   Pakistanis claim the war has cost them hundreds of lives of theirown in terrorist bombings, a glut of firearms and a burgeoningheroin trade.   Weapons earmarked for the rebels frequently have wound up withthe drug barons of Pakistan's North West Frontier.   Pakistani narcotics officials claim the fighting in Afghanistanhas diverted much of its opium and heroin production to Pakistan.   The drugs find their way to Europe and North America via theArabian Sea port of Karachi, the agents say.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Release Anytime</NOTE></DOC>
