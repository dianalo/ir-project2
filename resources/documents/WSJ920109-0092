The rail, shipping and trucking concern said $634 millionof the charge is tied to costs of cutting employees acrossall units, including work force reductions expected fromnegotiations that its rail unit is conducting with unions.The company said the talks are intended to reduce the numberof on-train workers &quot;substantially&quot; and to &quot;dramatically&quot;improve productivity.</LP><TEXT>   Following similar charges by other rail companies,analysts said, the charge was in line with expectations andthe job cuts should reduce day-to-day operating costs. &quot;Youhave to view this as a positive development,&quot; said GraemeAnne Lidgerwood, a First Boston Corp. analyst.   CSX, which is based in Richmond, Va., said 575 staff cutsand restructuring programs are already being conducted at itsrail and shipping units. The rail unit, CSX Transportation,is discharging 325, or 8%, of its non-contract employeessystemwide and relocating certain Baltimore-based supervisoryand staff workers to other locations. Shipping unit Sea-LandService Inc. previously disclosed plans to discharge 250employees and restructure two divisions and various terminaloperations. CSX employs more than 49,000 people. Any workforce reductions agreed to in talks with the union would bein addition to these cuts.   CSX also said it will recognize a $318 million pretaxliability in the fourth quarter, reflecting adoption of a newaccounting standard for retirement benefits. On a cumulativeafter-tax basis, the change lowers 1991 earnings by $4million and prior years' earnings by $196 million, thecompany said.   The accounting standard, which all U.S. companies arerequired to adopt by 1993, requires companies to set up areserve for health benefits of current employees for whenthey retire. In doing this, companies have to take non-cashcharges to reflect the accrued benefits of prior years thathadn't been reflected in previous financial statements.   As a result of both charges, the company predicted netlosses for the fourth quarter and full year, but it declinedto disclose the expected amounts. For the first nine months,CSX reported earnings of $280 million, or $2.80 a share.   CSX posted earnings of $129 million, or $1.31 a share, in1990's fourth quarter, and $416 million, or $4.15 a share, in1990.   The company said the other $121 million of the pretaxcharge is for negotiating, environmental and litigationcosts.   Following the announcement, both Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.and Moody's Investors Service Inc. confirmed CSX's debtratings. The company's senior debt is rated triple-B by Sandamp;Pand single-A-3 by Moody's. Both rating agencies said the workforce charge should be offset by the benefits of lower costsand improved productivity.   CSX was up 50 cents at $56.125 in late New York StockExchange trading.</TEXT></DOC>
