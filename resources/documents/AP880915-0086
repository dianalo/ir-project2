The demonstrators tied up traffic on the bridge and the EastRiver before climbing back up shortly before 2 a.m. today, eighthours after they lowered themselves from the span and unfurled ahuge banner reading, ``Stop Ocean Dumping Now.''   Andrew Davis, spokesman for the worldwide ecological group, saidthe protesters had hoped to block barges carrying treated sewagesludge for dumping 106 miles at sea.   They dangled some 100 feet above the water, forcing the CoastGuard to stop all traffic from passing under the bridge, said CoastGuard spokesman Joe Gibson.   But the barge departed as scheduled shortly before midnight,traveling north via Long Island Sound to the ocean instead ofsouth, said Lt. Cmdr. Larry Brooks.   ``We couldn't let them transit under the bridge because of thesafety to these people,'' Brooks said. ``So they asked if it was OKto take an alternative route and we thought it was perfectlysuitable.''   Police Sgt. Ed Burns said 13 people who swung from the bridgeand 11 others who assisted were arrested and would be charged withcriminal trespass, disorderly conduct and obstructing governmentaladministration, all misdemeanors.   On Tuesday, five Greenpeace members were arrested after theychained a dinghy to the rear of a sewage barge and a protester to amooring line, police said.</TEXT></DOC>
