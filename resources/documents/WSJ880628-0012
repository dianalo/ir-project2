Management Science, the nation's largest software concern for mainframe computers, wouldn't say when it received the offer, which it disclosed at its annual meeting. But it said its board met earlier yesterday and decided that the offer wasn't in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.    Yesterday, in national over-the-counter trading, Management Science common closed at $7.625, up 12.5 cents.    Management Science's directors together own a 24% stake in the company, which has about 16.6 million common shares outstanding.    The meeting was adjourned to July 12 to give shareholders additional time to consider certain items on the agenda in light of the offer. These include proposals that would limit directors' liability and allow directors to look at a broad range of factors, including social and economic issues and the competence, experience and integrity of a potential acquirer, in considering a takeover offer.    Management Science said the Computer Associates offer was conditioned on approval of the Management Science board and necessary government clearances, among other things. The company said it had decided not to pursue discussions with Computer Associates.    For 1987, Management Science reported a $221,000 operating loss on revenue of $258.5 million. An accounting adjustment for how the company recognizes license fees resulted in a one-time charge of $70.2 million, contributing to a net loss of $71 million. In 1986, the company had net income of $18.7 million, or $1.03 a share, on revenue of $193.4 million.    In Garden City, Anthony Wang, president of Computer Associates, said the company will study Management Science's response and then decide a countermove. The executive, noting Management Science's disappointing financial results, said the synergies resulting from a combination of the two companies would benefit both companies' shareholders. </TEXT></DOC>
