That intervention, according to DuBois Gilliam, a HUDdeputy assistant secretary during the Reagan administration,led to a manipulation of federal monies to fund a $500,000feasibility study on a trade center that was pushed by aprominent supporter of the Reagan/Bush campaigns.</LP><TEXT>   According to Mr. Gilliam, Mr. Barreto then said he wouldtalk with Mr. Bush. Later that same day, Mr. Gilliam said, amember of the vice president's staff contacted the HUDsecretary's executive assistant, Deborah Dean, who asked Mr.Gilliam about the project.   &quot;She indicated to me she got a call from the vicepresident's office and that they wanted the project funded,&quot;Mr. Gilliam told the subcommittee.   Mr. Gilliam said he told Ms. Dean he would try to arrangefunding and called Kansas City officials, who moved fundsfrom the city's federally funded community development blockgrant to the trade center. Mr. Gilliam added that the KansasCity cash was replenished with money from the secretary'sdiscretionary fund.   Mr. Barreto said in a telephone interview that Mr.Gilliam's account is &quot;a lot of malarkey.&quot; Although he &quot;had alot of meetings with the vice president,&quot; Mr. Barreto said hedoesn't remember ever discussing the trade centerspecifically with him.   Kansas City's assistant city manager, James Threatt, saidin a telephone interview that Mr. Gilliam told city officialsthat the vice president supported the program. &quot;The cityreviewed the fund request for the proposed feasibility studyand determined it was not only eligible, but clearlymeritorious,&quot; said Mr. Threatt. &quot;The proposal was consideredin two hearings before the city council and approved.&quot;   A White House spokesman said: &quot;We don't know anythingabout it.&quot;   Ms. Dean's attorney declined to comment.   Mr. Gilliam is serving an 18-month prison sentence foraccepting payoffs in connection with his HUD duties. Hetestified before the House Government Operations subcommitteeon housing and employment, which is investigating favoritism,corruption and mismanagement at the agency during the Reaganyears.   During his second of three days of testimony, Mr. Gilliamdescribed how important it was for projects to have a sponsorwithin HUD to gain approval. He told how he, Ms. Dean andThomas Demery, then the assistant secretary for housing,would discuss the allocation of so-calledmoderate-rehabilitation housing grants.   &quot;If you weren't sitting at the table that day, you didn'teat,&quot; he said. &quot;Somebody had to be pushing your project.&quot;   To avoid being caught in what he knew were questionableand illegal activities, Mr. Gilliam said he would tear up hisnotes about projects and carry them from the HUD officebuilding in a medicine bag for disposal.   Nonetheless, the department's inspector general beganinvestigating him, and when it got too &quot;hot,&quot; Mr. Gilliamsaid he decided to resign in 1987, after more than threeyears at HUD. But before he left, he tried to arrange aseverance package that subcommittee Chairman Thomas Lantos(D., Calif.) estimated would have been worth millions ofdollars.   Mr. Gilliam said he asked Ms. Dean to ask then-HUDSecretary Samuel Pierce to give Mr. Gilliam an allocation of400 moderate-rehabilitation units, which Mr. Gilliam thenwould develop. Mr. Pierce refused the 400 because he thought&quot;I was being greedy,&quot; Mr. Gilliam said, but the secretary didapprove 250 units.   He never got any units, he added, because the inspectorgeneral's investigation was getting too close to him.   Mr. Pierce's attorney, Paul Perito, issued a statementthat &quot;Mr. Pierce denies all allegations of wrongdoing andimproper conduct.&quot; The attorney added that it was&quot;inconceivable that the subcommittee has accepted, at facevalue, the unsubstantiated testimony&quot; of Mr. Gilliam.   ---   Katherine Walsh contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
