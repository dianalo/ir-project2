(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   James Earl Ray, serving a 99-year prisonsentence for killing civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.,has filed for divorce from his wife of 12 years.   In a petition filed Feb. 5 in Morgan County, Ray, 62, said onlythat irreconcilable differences had developed between him and hiswife, Anna Sandhu Ray, 45.   But relatives said Ray is upset because his wife has not visitedhim in Brushy Mountain State Prison, west of Knoxville, for severalyears.   The Rays married in 1978. They met while she worked as an artistfor a Knoxville television station during Ray's trial for escapingfrom Brushy Mountain.   In October 1988, Mrs. Ray threatened to file for divorce, sayingRay had cut her out of profits from a book he's writing about hislife, but she did not follow through.   In an interview last month with the Nashville Banner, Mrs. Raysaid she still believed her husband was innocent of the Kingslaying.   Ray has contended he was framed to cover up an FBI assassinationplot to kill the civil rights leader, who was shot to death April4, 1968, in Memphis.</TEXT></DOC>
