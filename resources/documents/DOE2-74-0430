Decreasing the initialdendrite size, which is in effect the same as decreasing the dislocationbarrier spacing, increases the ultimate tensile stress and ductility.Increasing the modulus of the dendrites or filament material also increasesthe ultimate tensile stress appreciably. The effect of temperature onthe ultimate tensile stress was also investigated. It was found thatthe strength of Cu-20%Ta was higher than that of Cu-20%Nb at all temperaturesand annealing conditions, and both exhibited an age hardening phenomenonat 150{degree}C. The decreases in strength with temperature were explainedup to 300{degree}C by the expected decreases in strength based on thedecrease in shear modulus of Cu and beyond that by filament coarsening.43 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
