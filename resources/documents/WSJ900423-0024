Mr. Bush made the announcement as part of his observanceof Earth Day during a Florida fishing vacation. His proposalwould establish an &quot;area to be avoided&quot; approximately 10miles off the Florida coast and five miles off the reef. Themeasure would ban vessels larger than 50 meters in length, orthose carrying oil or hazardous materials, from entering thearea. The area extends from Key Biscayne to the Dry Tortugas.</LP><TEXT>   The administration's proposal must be forwarded to theInternational Maritime Organization for approval. While themeasure doesn't carry the rule of law, adoption by the bodyindicates that 128 member nations intend for ships registeredto those countries to abide by the guidelines. Internationalaccord is necessary, according to officials, because the reefline lies five to seven miles off the shoreline, beyond U.S.domestic shipping jurisdiction.   The action follows three ship groundings off the reef linelast fall. No hazardous materials were spilled, but the shipscaused extensive damage to the reefs, which Mr. Bush called&quot;one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world and a uniquenational treasure.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
