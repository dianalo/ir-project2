<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-45-0289 </DOCNO><TEXT>The oxidation of the cluster Pd{sub 4}(CO){sub 5}(PPh{sub 3}){sub 4} (I)by oxygen or Pd(OAc){sub 2} gives the cluster [Pd{sub 4}(CO){sub 5}(PPh{sub3}){sub 2}]z (II). The cluster Pd{sub 3}(CO){sub 3}(PPh{sub 3}){sub 4}(III) and I are spontaneously converted into the cluster [Pd{sub 4}(CO){sub3}(PPh{sub 3}){sub 4}]/sub m/ (IV) in solutions in an inert atmosphere.Cluster IV is only one of the conversion products of III and I. CompoundsII and IV have been characterized by elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy.The minimal value of the coefficients z = m = 2 has been evaluated fromthe values of k = (x = y)/n{sup 2} and k' = k x n for the known clustersPd/sub n/(CO)/sub x/(PR{sub 3})/sub y/. In an atmosphere of carbon monoxide,compounds II and IV are converted into Pd{sub 10}(CO){sub 12}(PPh{sub3}){sub 6}, and under the action of an excess of PPh{sub 3} they areconverted into Pd(PPh{sub 3}){sub 4}. The proposed structure for compoundsII and IV is a bicapped octahedron.</TEXT></DOC>
