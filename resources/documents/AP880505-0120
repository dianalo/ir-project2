(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said today he will ``appealfor fairness'' to every ``super delegate'' and member of theDemocratic National Committee and try to convince those partyleaders that their support should correspond to the popular vote inthe primaries and caucuses.   After spending the night with a farm family in this ruralNebraska hamlet, Jackson told reporters that front-runner MichaelDukakis' lead in delegates is an ``inflated, padded lead'' createdby super delegates committed to Dukakis.   Super delegates are party leaders or elected public officials.The Democratic Party designates 643 super delegates who have alarge voice at the national convention.   Of those 643, Dukakis has the commitment of 166 thus far,Jackson 46 and the remainder are uncommitted. Overall, Dukakisholds a delegate lead of almost 600 over Jackson.   Jackson, who in the last two days has begun outspoken criticismof the super delegate system, said it gives voters the impressionthat ``their vote does not count.''   Asked if he intended to hold back his support for the party'sticket if the delegate count did not directly correspond to thepopular vote, Jackson said, ``That's immature. Why should weproceed in that atmosphere? Let's be reasonable, rational andconsistent.''   Talking to a small group of reporters at the farmhouse of peaceactivists Maxine and Fred Schroeder, Jackson took a jab at Dukakis'gubernatorial problems in Massachusetts. He said there is a $77million shortfall in the state budget and added, ``We cannot runour country on state-by-state miracles.''   He accused Dukakis of cutting money for pregnant teen-agers andsenior citizens. ``Some of our most vulnerable people have to bearthe burden of the cuts,'' he said.   Dukakis has maintained that no existing services will be cut tobalance the Massachusetts state budget.   Jackson spoke to a gymnasium full of students at Kearney HighSchool before heading to campaign in New Mexico and then California.   Jackson has not said whether he intends to mount an all-outchallenge to party rules like the one he waged during his 1984presidential race.   Jackson complained Wednesday at a news conference and later inan address to the Congressional Black Caucus that the popular votecandidates win is not directly tied to the number of delegates theyreceive toward the nomination.   ``There must be some reasonable correlation between the popularvote and the delegate count in a democracy,'' he told the blackcongress members.   ``We're not talking about generosity. We're talking aboutreciprocity.''   And he suggested that he expects such reciprocity as a conditionof his cooperation with the Democratic ticket in the generalelection.   Party leaders and the pundits, he said, are trying to figure out`how you can get a combination of Jackson support, a short platformand win.   ``That's not a formula for winning,'' he said.   The mention of the platform apparently was a signal that Jacksonwants more specifics in the party platform than does Democraticchairman Paul Kirk, who has indicated it should be streamlined.   Asked by reporters what he would do about his concerns regardingdelegates, the Democratic contender said, ``I can only appeal ...for fairness.''   Although he has suffered a string of losses to Dukakis,including Tuesday in Ohio and Indiana, Jackson said he would fighton and take the nomination. He won the District of Columbia, whichoffered only a fraction of the delegates of Indiana and Ohio.   ``We never before in history had the mathematical chance ofwinning. We can win,'' he told the Black Caucus.   But that would require winning virtually all of the delegates atstake in the remaining seven primary states, as well as the supportof the super delegates.   Jackson also met with members of the Congressional DemocraticCaucus in what chairman Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri called a``warm and successful meeting.''   And he held a session with several liberal activists, includingconsumer advocate Ralph Nader and representatives of peace andenvironmental groups.</TEXT></DOC>
