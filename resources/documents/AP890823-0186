MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hedging a bet, the White House seems to betaking out some political insurance against the risk of a recessionnext year. Should there be a serious slump, the Republicans willblame the Federal Reserve Board.   The administration long ago declared that the old theory ofbusiness cycles, up then down, no longer need apply to the U.S.economy. At least it hasn't applied since early in Ronald Reagan'spresidency. The longest period of economic expansion in peacetimehistory began in 1982 and continues now.   President Bush said as a candidate that he could keep it goingwith policies that restrain spending and forbid new taxes. ``Afterall, economic growth doesn't die out from old age, it is smotheredby bad policies,'' he said last Oct. 24.   Picking up the theme, with some of the same words, anadministration economic spokesman said on July 10 that therecord-long expansion could be sustained, with the outlook favorablefor continuing growth ahead.   ``Economic history teaches us that expansions have not died ofold age, but were killed by policies _ usually monetary policies _which with the benefit of hindsight were unfortunate mistakes,''said Undersecretary of Commerce Michael R. Darby.   Translated, that argument holds that it's usually the FederalReserve Board that stalls or scuttles economic expansion by clampingtoo tightly on the money supply and pushing up interest rates.   That's the issue that prompted Budget Director Richard G. Darmanto chide the central bank for tightening interest rates because ofwhat he said may have been excessive concern about renewed inflation.   ``If we do have a recession it will be because they have erred onthe side of caution,'' Darman said Aug. 13 on NBC's ``Meet thePress.'' ``I think it's quite important that the Fed appreciate thatgrowth is indeed fundamental to the health of this economy, and thatthey not become too obsessed with concern about things going toowell for too long.''   Bush endorsed those comments. ``I think I've said essentially thesame thing in the past,'' Bush said. He called Darman's commentsbalanced, although he dodged the question of whether he agreed thatthe Fed would be responsible for any recession.   ``Listen, I don't know of any president, now or in the past, whodoesn't favor lower interest rates,'' Bush said. ``... That's theAmerican way.''   Trying to chart a course between the risks of inflation on oneside and recession on the other, the Fed began increasing interestrates in March 1988 and pushed up short-term rates by threepercentage points over the next year. Then, early in June, it beganedging rates downward to stimulate economic activity and avoid asevere slump.   Its policy-making committee met on Tuesday and decided how toproceed for the next six weeks. Those policy decisions will not bedisclosed until Oct. 6, although their impact could show in themarketplace. Current guessing is that interest rates will be left ator near current levels into the fall.   As Bush noted, strains between the central bank and the WhiteHouse are nothing new. Lower interest rates serve the political andbudget agendas of most presidents. Alan Greenspan, chairman of theFederal Reserve Board, knows all about that. He was an economicadviser to Richard M. Nixon during the 1968 campaign. He served aschairman of the Council of Economic Advisors when Gerald R. Ford waspresident. Reagan appointed Greenspan chairman of the Fed.   The seven governors of the Federal Reserve are appointed for14-year terms; the chairmanship is for five years, tenure that issupposed to provide political insulation.   That seems to work. In the past there have been times of realtension between the Fed and expansion-bent presidents andCongresses. This season's differences have been polite by comparison.   Shortly after he was inaugurated, Bush said Greenspan seemed tobe worrying more about inflation than he was. After the Fed raisedinterest rates in February, the president said they differed on theright way to interpret economic indicators regarding possibleinflation.   But Greenspan has warned that inflation itself can triggerrecession. ``If inflation emerges, I think a recession will move upon us much more quickly than we can imagine, and when it occurs itwill be a prolonged one,'' he told Congress early this year.   In congressional testimony last month, he said that while therisk may have shifted somewhat away from inflation, the rate stillis too high. The administration says the inflation rate is headeddownward, and that interest rates should therefore be eased.   ``Some day, some event will end the extraordinary string ofeconomic advances that has prevailed since late 1982,'' Greenspanhas warned.   That always has happened before. The administration isn'tconceding that it will again, at least not soon. But if it does, theblame has been assigned in advance.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
