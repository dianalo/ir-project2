The cease-fire took effect at midnight Tuesday to mark theIslamic holiday of Eid Al-Adha and was to have lasted four days. Itcollapsed after the rebels launched seven rockets on the capital andgovernment forces fired back, said Foreign Ministry spokesmanMohammad Nabi Amani.   He did not know the number of casualties because most offices,including the Military Information Department, were closed inobservance of the holiday.   Amani also said rebels fired rockets on Jalalabad, the capital ofNangarhar province. The guerrillas have been trying to capture thecity, Afghanistan's fifth largest, since March.   ``We had no option but to fire back,'' the Foreign Ministryspokesman said.   Hours before the cease-fire began, government soldiers fired atleast 100 rockets at guerrilla bases in the hills around Kabul, acity of 2.25 million people.   The rockets were fired late Tuesday into the Paghman mountains,12 miles northwest of Kabul, Amani said.   ``We had information that the opponents had massed a large numberof rockets to hit Kabul during the Eid, so we carried out apre-emptive operation,'' he said.   The government had said its troops would halt offensive actionsuntil midnight Saturday to celebrate the Islamic holiday, held 40days after the end of Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting.   But a spokesman for one of the seven main guerrilla groups basedin Pakistan rejected the offer.   ``The cease-fire doesn't have any meaning for the muhajedeenbecause we began our fight to get rid of the communists, and theproblem is not solved,'' said the spokesman, who goes by the name ofWakil.   The guerrillas, supported by the United States and mostly basedin Pakistan, are trying to overthrow the Soviet-backed governmentthat seized power in a 1978 coup.   Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have alleged the guerrillas,along with Pakistani military advisers, are planning an offensive onKabul and President Najib's government has warned it may shellPakistan.   Pakistan has denied Najib's charges it is directly involved inthe attacks.   The Soviet Union ended nine years of military involvement inAfghanistan when it withdrew the last of its troops on Feb. 15 undera U.N.-mediated accord. Moscow has continued to supply arms to theKabul government.</TEXT></DOC>
