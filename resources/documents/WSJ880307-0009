Three environmentalist U.S. senators have dredged up the ads, in which Du Pont promised it would stop producing chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons if they were found to harm the environment.    More than a decade of scientific studies later, 31 countries have signed a treaty declaring chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs, a menace to the earth's protective ozone layer. And Du Pont is still the biggest U.S. producer of CFCs.    &quot;The time has arrived for the Du Pont Co. to fulfill that pledge,&quot; wrote Sens. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), Robert Stafford (R., Vt.) and David Durenberger (R., Minn.) to Du Pont Chairman Richard Heckert.    The lawmakers suggested Du Pont stop production of CFCs within a year, because they deplete the ozone layer that shields the earth from the sun's ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer and other environmental damage. But Du Pont's Mr. Heckert wrote back refusing, saying that would be &quot;unwarranted and counterproductive&quot; and &quot;more drastic . . . than scientific evidence justifies.&quot;    In its ads, and separately in testimony on Capitol Hill, Du Pont had promised: &quot;Should reputable evidence show that some fluorocarbons cause a health hazard through depletion of the ozone layer, we are prepared to stop production of the offending compounds.&quot; Since then, the U.S. has banned use of most CFCs, which also have been called fluorocarbons, in aerosol sprays. CFCs also are blamed for a seasonal &quot;hole&quot; each year in the ozone layer over Antarctica.    The Senate plans to vote next week to ratify the international pact to freeze, and then to roll back by 50%, world production of CFCs by mid-1999. CFCs, developed by Du Pont in the 1930s, are widely used as cooling agents in air-conditioners and in refrigerators, and in making plastic foams and computer cleaning solvents.    Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont supports the treaty, but argues that &quot;at the moment, scientific evidence does not point to the need for dramatic CFC emission reductions,&quot; such as a complete stop of production.    Steve Seidel, a senior analyst with the Environmental Protection Agency, says there is scientific consensus that chlorine from CFCs attacks and destroys ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere. However, he said there is dispute about how drastically CFCs must be reduced to stem dangerous levels of ozone depletion. </TEXT></DOC>
