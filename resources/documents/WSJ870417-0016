Officials of the Democratic front-runner's 1988 campaign said they're negotiating for the return of the money, about $30,000, because, under federal election law, donations to the 1988 campaign can't be used to pay the 1984 debts.    The money was seized by a lawyer and two federal marshals at one of two Hart fund-raisers here Wednesday night, the AP reported. Campaign officials say the 1984 debt amounts to about $1.3 million. </TEXT></DOC>
