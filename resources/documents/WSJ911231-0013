The bond market's bellwether security, the 30-yearTreasury bond, rose 7/8 point, or $8.75 for a bond with a$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in theopposite direction of its price, eased to 7.44% from 7.51% onFriday.</LP><TEXT>   The bond market opened little changed in quiet holidaytrading. But the market came to life shortly after thePurchasing Management Association of Chicago reported thatits composite index of business activity fell to 46.0% inDecember from 53.2% in November. A reading above 50%generally indicates that the manufacturing sector isexpanding, while a reading below 50% indicates a contraction.   Economists said that the Chicago index raises thepossibility that the National Association of PurchasingManagement's index of industrial health also will fall belowthe crucial 50% level. The national report is due outThursday.   &quot;This is a bad tiding for the first quarter,&quot; said DonaldFine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank Corp.,referring to the downturn in the Chicago purchasingmanagement index. &quot;The report shows that the industrialsector is once again contracting. And that's not only truefor Chicago, I think the national number will also show thatthe industrial sector is contracting.&quot;   Slow or negative economic growth is considered bullish forbonds because it often leads to lower inflation and interestrates, trends that often result in higher bond prices.   &quot;The {bond} market is convinced that the economy won'tgrow and that the Fed will ease {monetary policy} again,&quot;says Mitchell Held, economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp;Co.   The Federal Reserve took a relatively aggressive easingstep Dec. 20, cutting the discount rate by a full percentagepoint, to 3.5%. However, although subsequent economic datahave pointed to continuing economic weakness, Mr. Held sayshe isn't &quot;so sure&quot; the economy is weak enough to prompt anyfurther easing by the central bank.   Mr. Held thinks bond market expectations of economicactivity &quot;are too low,&quot; and that small increases infourth-quarter and first-quarter gross domestic product arepossible. Although GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.8% in thethird quarter, fourth-quarter statistics have by and largeportrayed an economy contracting again.   But among the recent portents of recovery have been risingmoney supply growth, a soaring stock market and firmerhousing data. On the latter front, the National Associationof Realtors said yesterday morning that existing homes salesrose 5.4% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of3,330,000.   Bond market participants ignored that news, however,confident that a stagnant economy warranted buyinglonger-term securities for their yield advantage overshort-term issues.   The market also entered uncharted technical territoryyesterday as the March Treasury bond futures contract closedat 104 8/32, a record high for a bond futures contract,according to Optima Futures Analysis Inc., Chicago.   Looking ahead, the Public Securities Association hasrecommended a 2 p.m. EST end to government securities tradingtoday ahead of the New Year holiday.   On the economic calendar, the Commerce Department isslated to release the November index of leading economicindicators at 8:30 a.m. EST this morning. A Dow Jones CapitalMarkets Report survey suggests that economists look for theindex to have declined 0.4% in November after rising 0.1% inOctober.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys ended sharply higher in light trading.   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 106 17/32to yield 7.44% compared with 105 21/32 to yield 7.51% onFriday.   Other market sectors also fared well. For example, 10-yearnotes ended at 105 15/32 to yield 6.71%, up from 104 24/32 toyield 6.81% on Friday. Two-year notes rose 1/8 to 100 14/32to yield 4.75%.   Meanwhile, the Treasury sold $10.45 billion of billsyesterday at its regular weekly auction. The average discountrate on both new three-month bills and six-month bills was3.91%. Those rates were up from last week's auction, when therate on threemonth bills was 3.75% and the rate on six-monthbills was 3.85%.   Here are the details of yesterday's auction by theTreasury of 13-week and 26-week bills:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon-equivalent yield is based on a 366-day year.                                                                                                                                    13-Week         26-Week                                                                                                        Applications .......... $32,295,395,000   $30,987,870,000 Accepted bids ......... $10,231,765,000   $10,216,710,000 Accepted at low price..           3.91%             3.91% Accepted noncompet'ly..  $1,442,325,000      $992,200,000 Average price (Rate)...  99.012 (3.91%)    98.023 (3.91%) High price (Rate) .....  99.019 (3.88%)    98.033 (3.89%) Low price (Rate) ......  99.012 (3.91%)    99.023 (3.91%) Coupon equivalent .....           4.01%             4.06% CUSIP number ..........       912794YG3         912794YVO                                                                                                          Both issues are dated Jan. 2. The 13-week bills matureApril 2, 1992, and the 26-week bills mature July 2, 1992.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Zale Corp. junk bonds fell in price as the companyannounced that it would default on an interest payment.   However, the action didn't prompt a great deal of tradingvolume in Zale bonds, traders say. The market is likely tohold back until it is clearer how the Dallas jewelry chainplans to deal with its financial straits, analysts say.   Zale said it would halt all payments to bondholders, banksand suppliers, missing a $52 million interest payment toholders of its junk bonds. The payment originally had beendue in early December, but Zale had requested and received agrace period of about a month to make the payment. However,bond market participants said they weren't surprised thatZale wasn't able to make the Dec. 31 deadline either.   They now wait to see whether the company will make abankruptcy-law filing voluntarily or if it will be forcedinto bankruptcy proceedings. One bondholder recentlythreatened to force a Chapter 11 filing if the $52 millionwasn't paid. Neither the bondholder nor Zale's officialscould be immediately reached for further comment.   Whichever choice the firm makes, &quot;bankruptcy is prettyimminent,&quot; contends Jan Dillow, senior high-yield analyst atSalomon Brothers Inc. &quot;Now it becomes a waiting game and it'sup to the bankruptcy court&quot; how the company's bonds arelikely to trade.   Zale's 13.125% senior subordinated debentures, due 2007,dropped 1/2 point to 11 1/2.   In the broader market, most junk bond prices wereunchanged, as were investment-grade corporate bonds. Therewere no new issues in the debt markets this session.   The junk bonds of Burlington Holdings Inc. continued theirrecent rise, with gains of about 1 1/2 points. Burlingtonbonds have gained since the announcement ofbetterthan-expected results for the fourth quarter, whichwere released last Friday. The textile company said it earned$8.3 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $32.5million in the year-ago period.   Burlington's 13.875% senior subordinated notes, due 1996,gained 1 1/2 points to 91. The notes had traded at 88 beforethe earnings results were released.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Prices of municipal bonds ended unchanged to as much as1/2 point higher.   Among seasoned issues, the Florida Board of Education's6.70% securities of 2022 finished 1/2 higher at 101 3/8 toyield 6.57%.   No large municipal bond issues were priced yesterday.   An early close of 2 p.m. EST is anticipated ahead of theNew Year's holiday, in line with other bond markets.   On next week's new issue calendar, a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.group is expected to price $775 million New Jersey TurnpikeAuthority revenue bonds one day during the week. Proceedswill be used for the authority's capital program, includingpurchase of a 4.4 mile portion of Interstate 95 from theState of New Jersey, for $400 million.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Prices of mortgage securities ended higher.   In thin preholiday trading, Government National MortgageAssociation 7.5% securities for January delivery rose 11/32to 100 29/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Gold 7.5%securities increased 14/32 to 99 24/32 and Federal NationalMortgage Association 7.5% securities gained 14/32 to 9920/32.   Yesterday's gains extend a rally that has made it moredifficult to find issues trading around par. Those that areavailable have been in hot demand.   The majority of the actively traded mortgage securitiescarrying prices near par are the 7.5% issues, which tend tobe in relatively short supply.   Market players now eagerly await Thursday's Freddie Macsecurities prepayment figures for the mid-November tomid-December period. Mortgage market activity is seen heatingup again after that report and the December data due out nextweek from Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae.   If the figures from these three agencies show further bigprepayment gains, as expected, traders look for thelower-coupon issues -- which are least vulnerable to earlyprepayments -- to continue performing strongly.   Today's session, as recommended by the Public SecuritiesAssociation, will end at 2 p.m. EST.</TEXT></DOC>
