The lawmakers expressed worries about Oki ElectricIndustry Co.'s proposed acquisition of Seattle Silicon Corp.,a Bellevue, Wash., producer of engineering software used bydefense companies. Treasury Department officials confirmedthat Oki has proposed acquiring the U.S. company, and theysaid a Treasury-headed federal panel responsible forreviewing proposed foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies sawno national-security problems with it.                                                                                                          The Bush administration immediately threatened to veto theDemocrats' bill, which was introduced by Rep. Cardiss Collins(D., Ill.), chairwoman of the House subcommittee on commerce,consumer protection and competitiveness. William Barreda,deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for trade andinvestment, warned that the bill would &quot;compromise&quot; thetraditional U.S. policy of welcoming foreign investments andwould have &quot;harmful consequences for U.S. business abroad.&quot;   Linda Spencer, a foreign-investment specialist for theEconomic Strategy Institute, told the subcommittee thatJapanese investors figured in 282 of the 540 proposed foreignacquisitions of U.S. companies that were reviewed by theTreasury-led panel since October 1988. Some of theseacquisitions, including Nippon Sanso K.K.'s purchase ofSemi-Gas Systems Inc. and Komatsu Electronic Metals Co.'stakeover of Union Carbide Corp.'s polysilicon business, bothof which have been completed, have drawn fire from lawmakers.The Economic Strategy Institute is a Washington-basedthink-tank.   Mrs. Collins cited the Seattle Silicon case as an exampleof the administration's &quot;failure&quot; to block foreign takeoversof key U.S. technologies. Other Democrats, including MajorityLeader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), declared their support forthe bill.   Mr. Barreda, testifying before Mrs. Collins'ssubcommittee, said Seattle Silicon wouldn't be allowed totransfer its defense-related technology to Oki without properlicenses from the State Department and the Pentagon. Thetechnology involved is on a list of items that can't beexported to other nations -- or even transferred to foreigninterests in the U.S. -- without a license, he toldreporters. Other officials said the administration's reviewpanel found no reason to believe that Oki Electric wouldmisuse any technology it acquires from Seattle Silicon.   Oki Electric is a $4 billion-a-year producer oftelecommunications and information-processing systems. Aspokesman for Oki in Tokyo said, &quot;We're talking to SeattleSilicon about the proposed purchase, but it hasn't beendecided at all. We cannot tell whether a deal will come toreality or not.&quot;   A Seattle Silicon spokeswoman said the company will issuea statement about the matter soon.   The bill that Mrs. Collins introduced would requireinvestigations of any proposed acquisition of U.S.technologies that are deemed to be &quot;critical.&quot; It also wouldauthorize the president to attach conditions to certainforeign investments to protect the U.S. technology base. Andit would transfer the chairmanship of the reviewing panelfrom the Treasury to the Commerce Department, which has amore explicit mandate to protect the interests of U.S.industries.   Under the bill, the Pentagon and the Commerce Departmentwould define &quot;critical&quot; technologies. Both agencies alreadyhave adopted critical technology lists that include advancedmaterials, artificial intelligence, digital imaging,superconductors, high-performance computing, optoelectronicsand biotechnology.   Mr. Barreda rejected claims of the bill's supporters thatforeigners are increasingly targeting U.S. high-techconcerns. He told the subcommittee that foreign investmentdata collected since 1988 &quot;do not provide evidence that thisis occurring.&quot;   The Treasury aide also warned that the &quot;debate&quot; in theU.S. over foreign investments could be one reason for thesharp fall in such flows of capital into this country. In1990, foreign investments were 64% below their 1989 levels;Japanese investments alone were 53% lower than what they werethe year before, he said.   --   Jacob M.
