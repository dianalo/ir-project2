The European aircraft consortium said the planes will be acquired by Jersey-based Oasis International Group PLC and operated by Aerocancun under a commercial agreement. Airbus didn't give details on the accord between Oasis and Aerocancun, and Airbus officials weren't available to comment.    Delivery of the planes has been scheduled for November 1991 to May 1993. The choice of engines remains open. Airbus didn't disclose the amount of the order, although industry sources estimated that the price of one A-310-300 is slightly more than $60 million.    Airbus is a consortium among Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A of Spain. </TEXT></DOC>
