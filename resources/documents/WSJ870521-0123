To a chorus of cheers from a crowd in Tennessee, the president added that American commanders in the Gulf now are under orders to defend themselves and &quot;defend American lives.&quot;    The episode is sadly reminiscent of the administration's ill-fated effort to show the flag in Lebanon, which ended in tragedy and humiliation after a suicidal terrorist blew up the Marine barracks in Beirut. Once again, the administration seems to be hoping that a barrage of tough rhetoric and a token military force can restore American influence in the region and head off Soviet efforts to strengthen its hand in the Middle East.    Once again, the administration may have miscalculated. The president's tough talk and the administration's decision to register 11 Kuwaiti tankers and escort them through the Gulf will backfire if the U.S. can't stick to its commitment in the face of new and unpredictable threats to American fighting men.    The situation could become even more dangerous because, ironically, the Iraqi attack is producing a more pronounced U.S. tilt toward Iraq in the Gulf war. Says one senior administration official: &quot;The Iranians may not take that lying down.&quot;    The Navy may find, as the Marines in Beirut did, that it is ill-equipped to deal with the dangers posed by Iran, particularly terrorist actions. The type of missile attack launched by Iraq, apparently by mistake, or an attack on U.S. ships by land-based &quot;Silkworm&quot; missiles probably are the least likely Iranian responses to an increased American presence in the Gulf, argues Persian Gulf expert Fred Axelgard of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.    Although their war with Iraq often resembles World War I, the Iranians have shown some aptitude for unconventional military tactics, including the use of terrorism, and they know that in Lebanon, terrorism forced the Reagan administration to retreat.    The Navy's rules of engagement in the Gulf and the president's exhortations to self-defense are clear enough in the face of another missile attack. But an unconventional or terrorist strike at American facilities somewhere, or at Kuwait or Bahrain, is likely to revive the longstanding debate in Washington about how to retaliate against a shadowy enemy.    The Pentagon has developed endless contingency plans for strikes at a variety of targets in Iran, including some government offices in Tehran itself. Whether it is prepared to execute any of them, and under what circumstances, remains unclear.    &quot;The wisdom of waving the big stick if you can't sustain it is questionable,&quot; says Mr. Axelgard.    But as he did in Lebanon, Mr. Reagan is upping the ante despite deep divisions within his own administration, and between the White House and the Congress, about using military force to solve political problems.    Both the civilian leadership of the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff are wary of diverting American forces from their primary mission of confronting the Soviets, especially into conflicts that could escalate suddenly and unpredictably. In Congress, even some loyal Republicans are wary of writing a blank check to keep the Persian Gulf open -- especially when only 7% of oil the U.S. gets passes through the Strait of Hormuz, compared with 70% of Japan's.    &quot;Are we becoming a silent party to the Iran-Iraq war?&quot; said Rep. Tom Lantos (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East. Other lawmakers worry the administration may be skirting the War Powers Act by sending the Navy into a combat zone without the consent of Congress.    The abrupt withdrawal of the Marines from Lebanon, the administration's inability to deliver even token military aid to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and the secret attempts to ransom American hostages in Lebanon by selling arms to Iran and paying off Lebanese terrorists have undermined America's already limited credibility in the Arab world.    Recent developments haven't helped matters. A new plan to sell more F-15 jet fighters to Saudi Arabia faces an uphill battle in Congress -- especially since the Saudis apparently failed to chase the Iraqi fighter that attacked the Stark -- and opposition in Israel appears to have killed an American-backed effort to revive Mideast peace negotiations. Showing the flag in the Persian Gulf will only compound the problem if the administration can't keep it flying. </TEXT></DOC>
