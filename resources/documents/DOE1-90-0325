<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-90-0325 </DOCNO><TEXT>(High resolution) electron energy loss spectroscopy [(HR)EELS] has beenused successfully to provide direct spectroscopic evidence regardingdetails of the molecular fragmentation of methoxy (CH{sub 3}O) on Al(111)caused by energetic electron and ion beams. Chemisorbed methoxy on Al(111)is produced by heating of adsorbed CH{sub 3}OH. Irradiation of CH{sub3}O(a) by either energetic ({similar_to}300 eV) electrons or Ar{sup +}ions results in C--O and C--H bond scission with simultaneous formationof Al--O and Al--C bonds. During electron stimulated desorption the CH{sub3}O(a) species undergo sequential fragmentation first to CH/sub x/ groupsthat are captured by the surface and in the final decay process to adsorbedcarbon. C--O bonds in CH{sub 3}O(a) are depleted preferentially comparedto C--H bonds in CH/sub x/(a) species. The electron induced sequentialfragmentation of the parent CH{sub 3} group (from methoxy) to resultantCH/sub x/(a) occurs with an efficiency {similar_to}3 orders of magnitudegreater then the subsequent process of CH/sub x/(a) {yields}C(a). Crosssections for various bond scission processes in electron and ion bombardmenthave been estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
