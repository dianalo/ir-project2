Women arenoticeably absent.   The frontier province, which now is home for most of the 3.5million refugees of the Afghan war, is a mirror image of more thanhalf of Afghanistan's population.   Ethnically, the people of the frontier are of the Pashtoontribes. More than 60 percent of Afghans also are Pashtoons, but thetribes are split by the Afghan-Pakistan border. The Pashtoon codeof honor that demands family, honor and religion be defended to thedeath has played a major role in the Afghans' tenacity in their10-year war.   The ethnic minorities are many.   The largest of these are the Hazaras, who live in Hazarajat innorth- central Afghanistan, and the Tajiks, Uzbeks and Turkomans,who live toward the north along Afghanistan's border with theSoviet Union. Along the northeastern border with Pakistan live thefair-haired, light-skinned Nuristanis, who claim to be descendentsof deserters of Alexander the Great's army.   For the most part, Afghans are farmers tilling small holdingsnear their villages. The grueling heat of Pakistan contrastssharply to the fertile valleys and enticingly cool mountains ofAfghanistan.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Photos by AP Staff Photographer Jeff Widener</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, June 13</NOTE></DOC>
