(MCC) of Austin, Texas; MRSTechnology Inc. of Chelmsford, Mass.; Norden Systems Inc. of Norwalk, Conn.;andO;Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. of Troy Mich.; Tektronix Inc. of Beaverton, Ore.andO;and Zenith Electronics Corp. of Glenview, Ill.andP;  Contract amounts have notbeen negotiated.andM;The Department of Energy wants to give away supercomputer time to studyglobal warming models.andP;  A notice in the Aug. 29 Federal Register stated thatDOE's office of health and environmental research is interested in requestsfor use of supercomputer time &quot;to support the Atmospheric and ClimateResearch Division's efforts in understanding and diagnosing the performanceof the climate models, and in developing an advanced climate model.&quot;andM;DOE is looking for applications for use based on the equivalent of a Cray-1,known as computer recharge units or CRU's.andP;  DOE expects to have up to 13,000CRU's available for the project during 1991.andM;Erich Bloch, who stepped down as director of the National Science Foundationlast month, said the federal government's priorities in science andtechnology are all wrong.andP;  Big science projects such as the SuperconductingSuper Collider, the Human Genome Project and the Space Station are not asimportant as small-scale science and human development, he told members ofthe National Press Club.andM;&quot;There are too many costly projects and we lack the resources to fund themall,&quot; Bloch said.andP;  The science and technology community should realize thatthe nation's research enterprise &quot;has outgrown the capacity to support it.andO;We can't wait for things to get better next year.&quot;andM;Industry ActivityandM;Texas Instruments Inc. swallowed a $40 million loss on an Air Force contractto produce computer terminals for a system that detects nuclear explosionsfrom space.andP;  The Air Force recently restructured the original $85 millionprogram amid persistent cost and technical woes.andP;  The new plan calls forseparate development of terminals for use by airborne and ground units.andM;An Air Force official said the service is not dissatisfied with TexasInstruments.andP;  &quot;There hasn't been any finger-pointing at the management of theprogram.andP;  It just turns out that the job was tougher than they expected,&quot; theofficial said.andM;Major stumbling blocks included the computer software and the speed of theunit's microprocessor.andP;  &quot;The full-scale development requirements, inparticular the microprocessor, do not meet processing speed standards,&quot; addedthe Senate Armed Services Committee in its report on the defense bill.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
