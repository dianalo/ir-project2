The prosecution was initiated by a Quebec businessman,Glen Kealey, who has been picketing Parliament for the pastthree years, alleging that senior members of Prime MinisterBrian Mulroney's Conservative government had demandedkickbacks on government contracts.</LP><TEXT>   Justice Minister Kim Campbell said, &quot;The charges are theresult of an unusual procedure involving a privateprosecution under the criminal code. No police agency orattorney general has examined the matter in order todetermine whether public prosecution is warranted.&quot;   The charges were filed after 17 days of closed-doortestimony by politicians and police officers. The justice ofthe peace for Ottawa, Lynn Coulter, ruled that sufficientevidence had been produced for the filing of the charges.   The 13 politicians were accused of conspiring to defraudthe government &quot;by bribery, bid-rigging, kickbacks, falsehoodor other fradulent means,&quot; according to the charges.   The accused include Sports Minister Pierre Cadieux andseveral current and former close associates of Mr. Mulroney.The prime minister said he couldn't comment on the casebecause it is under investigation. Mr. Cadieux didn't respondto calls.   Charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice were filedagainst the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian MountedPolice, Norman Inkster, Deputy RCMP Commissioner MichaelShoemaker and former Deputy RCMP Commissioner Henry Jensen.An RCMP spokesman said the police hadn't seen a transcript ofthe testimony and didn't know on what grounds the obstructioncharges were being made.   News of the ruling prompted selling of the Canadian dollarbecause of the potential impact of the case on Mr. Mulroney'sgovernment. Despite buying support from the Bank of Canada,the Canadian dollar declined 0.76 U.S. cent yesterday,closing at 86.35 U.S. cents, its lowest level in almost threemonths.   The charges are expected to erode the already low standingof Mr. Mulroney's administration. According to a recent poll,68% of Canadians believe Mr. Mulroney should resign.   Mr. Kealey, a former Conservative Party worker, said,&quot;This is Canada's Watergate.&quot; The businessman's fight withthe government started in 1987 after the government refusedto lease space in an office complex that he and severalassociates planned to build. He claimed the government backedout after he refused to pay &quot;a kickback&quot; to the ConservativeParty of 5% of the value of the lease.   Richard Peck, a senior member of the Canadian BarAssociation, said the filing of charges by private citizensis rare. Most charges are filed by the police. Mr. Kealeydecided to file the charges himself because of a lack of aresponse from the police to his allegations.</TEXT></DOC>
