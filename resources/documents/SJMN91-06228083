Itis not always a good one.;    Douglas Connor, an experienced whitewater andsea kayaker from San Rafael, has mixed feelings about the Rangers, many ofwhom are from the Bay Area.;    Connor, a member of the 1990 U.S. WildwaterKayaking Team, says he admires the Rangers' bravery but sometimes questionstheir judgment.;    &quot;From what I've seen,&quot; he says, &quot;I think they're a bit outof control. They go into really rough stuff, but they're not always in controlof their boats when they're in there. . . . I'd consider most of them to bemore adventurers than skillful kayakers.&quot;;    Several other veteran paddlersinterviewed expressed similar concerns. &quot;Lunatic fringe,&quot; said one. &quot;Crazed,&quot;said another.;    The Rangers appear unfazed by such talk. On the contrary, ina recently filmed promotional video they come across with about as muchsubtlety as, well, a tsunami.;    One particularly strong scene features EricSoares, the group's official second in charge, who holds the rank of&quot;commander.&quot; As Soares stands on the beach delivering a lecture to the camera,it is easy to see why he has been chosen to lead.;    With his tall, athleticcarriage and booming orator's voice (in everyday life he is a professor ofmarketing at Hayward State), he cuts an imposing figure against a backdrop ofintimidating surf.;    &quot;In our society,&quot; Soares says above the roar of thewaves, &quot;people don't engage fear. . . . They avoid it. . . . (This) makespeople weak. It makes them tame.&quot;;    Later, as Soares and a companiondeliberately go for a training swim in a narrow, rocky, wave-pounded slotbetween two jagged-looking islets, the commander asks the rhetorical question,&quot;Are we crazy?&quot;;    This same thought crossed my mind one recent morning atHalf Moon Bay, where I was about to go kayaking with one of the Rangers.;   Michael Powers is a gentle, soft-spoken photographer with a warm, soothingpresence, a man who, in his own words, believes that &quot;humility is the path topower.&quot; But he is also a lieutenant commander of the Tsunami Rangers, notexactly the most humble group around.;    This apparent contradiction puzzledme, so I asked Powers to explain it. He replied, &quot;I'm not really into themacho stuff. We (the Rangers) get psyched into it when we're together. But onmy own I'm pretty careful.&quot;;    I hoped he was right, especially later thatday as we stood on the beach near Pillar Point, shimmying into our wetsuits.;   With a detached, serene look on his bearded face, Powers gazed in thedirection of the reef we were about to explore, then turned to me with anannouncement.;    &quot;It'll be thumping today,&quot; he said.;    Actually, it wasn'tall that bad -- once I got used to it.;    Acclimating was the tricky part. Iam an experienced whitewater kayaker and have run some of the more difficultrivers in the state. But the sheer immensity of the ocean, especially as itpours over and through a reef, is something no stream can match.;    At onepoint early on, I was a bit overwhelmed by it all. I thought, involuntarily,of a sort of prayer I hadn't heard since childhood. The words are, &quot;Oh, Lord,the sea is so big and my boat so small.&quot;;    Soon, however, I began to settledown and tune in. I realized that the same basic principles of fluid dynamicsapply to rivers and reefs. It was then that I really started to enjoy myself,shooting through narrow passageways in the rocks, timing it so the incomingswells wouldn't trounce me, feeling more or less like a playful seal or sealion.;    Even more enjoyable, perhaps, were the surroundings themselves. Mostpeople have never had the chance to explore a wave-swept reef.;    They'venever seen row upon row of sea palms clinging to the rocks like a miniatureforest, swaying, as if in the wind, with each passing comber. They've neverfloated in the lee of a large granite boulder, investigating starfish when,suddenly, a big swell passes through, enveloping the scene in an explosion offoam.;    It was a fascinating feeling and, in the midst of it, I felt Iunderstood just why the Tsunami Rangers are so enthralled with that dangerouszone where ocean water meets rock.;    Of course, I might have been even morecomfortable there had I been wearing some of the Tsunami Rangers' special gear-- such as shoulder pads, a face mask and other padding.;    But apparentlythe surroundings did not warrant such precautions. After all, these were,according to Michael, barely &quot;moderate&quot; conditions by the standards of theRangers. I can only imagine how they would define the word &quot;extreme.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  HOWARD DAVIDSON, Special to Venture  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910815  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  909  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday August 15, 199100228083,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
