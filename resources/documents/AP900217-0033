Spence made his remarks after a federal court hearing on theracketeering indictment that charged Mrs. Marcos and her latehusband, Ferdinand Marcos, with embezzling more than $100 millionfrom the Philippine treasury to buy art and Manhattan real estate.They also were charged with defrauding banks of $165 million inloans.   Marcos died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72.   Spence of Jackson Hole, Wyo., who had represented the family ofKaren Silkwood, was hired by Mrs. Marcos as part of changes in herdefense team that included the dropping of two other attorneys.   Mrs. Marcos' trial had been scheduled to start March 13 but atthe hearing, U.S. District Judge John Keenan delayed it a week,until March 20, to give Spence more time to prepare his case.   In his statement to reporters, Spence said, ``I hope you takethe opportunity to view this case from the perspective of a womaninstead of a queen because women have rights whether they're aqueen or not.''   He claimed the case was a political prosecution.   Spence, who has written several books including ``And Justicefor None,'' gained prominence when he tackled chemical giantKerr-McGee in 1979 to win a $10.5 million jury award for the heirsof Karen Silkwood. A federal appeals court reversed the award andthe family later settled for a smaller amount.   Silkwood, who worked at a Kerr-McGee plutonium plant inOklahoma, was killed in a car crash in 1974 on her way to meet areporter to talk about alleged workers' exposure to plutonium.   The two attorneys leaving Mrs. Marcos' legal team are Richard A.Hibey of Washington, her former lead counsel, and Sandor Frankel ofNew York.   Spence would not comment on why the two were leaving, but Hibeyhad been named in a possible conflict of interest raised byprosecutors, who said they intended to call one of his law partnersas a witness. Spence said Mrs. Marcos had become distressed when hediscussed the possible conflict with her.</TEXT></DOC>
