 This piece of equipment puts a n ew angle on scanning, byletting you scan three-dimensional objects.andM;The Overview Scanner looks more like the Starship Enterprise than aconventional scanner.andP;  Its head is mounted on an arm that overhangs thescanner bed, and two fluorescent tube lights protrude on either side.andP;  Youplace documents or objects you wish to scan faceup on the bed.andP;  Anything upto 1-1/2 inch high (and in some cases an inch or so higher) that will fitwithin the 8- by 10-inch scanning area is fair game for this machine.andM;This 3-D capability isn't the only departure the Overview Scanner makes fromits brethren: it is also designed to put high-quality images on-screenquickly rather than produce high-resolution had copy.andP;  The scanner's maximumresolution of 80 dots per inch makes it poorly suited to desktop publishingapplications; printouts of its scanned-in images lack the clarity and detailachieved by its competitors.andP;  but this product is not intended for output.andO;ATandamp;T instead is targeting communications functions like teleconferencing andimage databases.andM;THE OVERVIEW'S SOFTWARE  The $750 Scanware program that ATandamp;T offers for itsscanner includes capabilities that let you transmit scanned images to otherusers linked by moderns.andP;  You can send them as they are scanned in or savethem and transmit them in sequence as a slide show.andP;  Scanware also comesbundled with the popular PC Paintbrush program so that you can edit yourscanned-in graphics.andM;Two third-party image database programs--Scanbase Graphics' dBase-compatibleScanbase and DataEase International's DataEase/Image-In combintion--aredesigned to make optimal use of the Overview Scanner.andM;The Overview Scanner produces onscreen images of exceptional quality in VGAmode, thanks to its gray-scale capability.andP;  Rather than using dithering tosimulate different shades of gray, it produces 16 true grays by controllingthe intensity of each pixel on the screen.andP;  (A remarkable 64 shades of graywill be available in a future release of the software.)andP;  EGA allows only fourshades of gray, so at ATandamp;T's recommendation, we performed the performancetests with VGA.andM;The scanner proved a speedy performer during our testing.andP;  And since thesoftware begins to draw the image on-screen while you're still scanning,waiting time is kept to a bare minimum.andP;  Setting the scanner to a half-pagefurther reduces scanning time.andM;One advantage of the Overview Scanner's low resolution is that file sizes arerelatively small, making images easier to store in a database or transmitover communications lines.andP;  You can further reduce file sizes by using onlyfour shades of gray or just black and white, though this reduces imagequality considerably.andM;TESTING THE OVERVIEWandM;The Overview Scanner created an impressive on-screen reproduction of our testphotograph.andP;  It reporduced the grid test with no noticeable distortion,although the edges were cut off because of the 8- by 10-inch size limitationon the scan window.andP;  The Overview Scanner also did a respectable job scanningin the various stopwatches, add-in boards, magazines, and manuals wepresented it with.andM;* One drawback of the system's top-lit design is that glare from overheadlighting can cause probems.andP;  We had to turn off most of the ceiling lights toget optimal results on some of our tests, and the scanned image of thegray-scale test page was marred by a considerable amount of streaking.andP;  Thisdifficulty may have been partly the result of glare on the test copy'shigh-gloss finish, but even spraying the copy with a matte finish failed toeliminate the problem.andP;  (ATandamp;T told us that a filter is available to reduceglare but did not provide one in time for testing.)andM;Another difficulty arises with pages that curl slightly at the edges.andP;  Toavoid distortion in the scanned image, we had to devise makeshift solutionsusing rulers or Scotch tape to hold down the edges of the paper.andM;But aside from these obstacles, the Overview Scanner does what it wasdesigned to do very well.andP;  It would be a good choice for scanning photos andsignatures to add to a personnel database, scanning parts for an inventorydatabase, or scanning drawings and models for use in teleconferencing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
