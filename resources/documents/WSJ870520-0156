The Bank of Japan bought 141 metric tons of the metal last year, the company's annual report on gold sales said. The gold was purchased primarily to mint coins commemorating Emperor Hirohito's 60th anniversary on the throne, George Milling-Stanley, author of the report, said, but some of it was transferred to the Bank of Japan.    &quot;Monetary officials will play down the increase in Japan's gold reserves,&quot; Peter Fells, a director of Consolidated Gold Fields, said. &quot;But the purchases are significant.&quot; Japan, he said, is the first major industrial nation to buy gold for its monetary reserves since the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund cut gold's link to the dollar and ended its monetary role in the early 1970s.    &quot;For the most part, central banks remain convinced of the value of gold and are committed to holding a substantial part of their reserves in the form of the metal,&quot; the report said.    Japan's central bank reserves of gold now total 887 metric tons, or about one-tenth the size of the U.S.'s stockpile, according to Mr. Fells. A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds.    The Philippines, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela and Ecuador, all gold-producing nations, bought gold last year to boost their reserves, the report said. But Canada, also a gold producer, sold 12 metric tons from its reserves, it said, and has continued to sell this year.    Communist nations' sales, mainly by the Soviet Union and to a lesser extent China, nearly doubled to 402 metric tons last year, the report said, and Soviet sales have continued in 1987.    Gold supplies, including new production and recycled scrap, totaled almost 2,000 tons in 1986, an increase of 20% from the previous year and 62% in the past five years, it said. Total industrial demand was well below supplies at 1,666 tons, the report said, illustrating the role played by central bank and investment buying in supporting gold's price. </TEXT></DOC>
