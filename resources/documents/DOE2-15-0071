<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-0071 </DOCNO><TEXT>The realization of the N = 1 higher-spin superalgebra, proposed earlierby E.S. Fradkin and the author, is found in terms of bosonic quantumoperators. The extended higher-spin superalgebras, generalizing ordinaryextended supersymmetry with arbitrary N andgt; 1, are constructed by addingfermion quantum operators. Automorphisms, real forms, subalgebras, contractionsand invariant forms of these infinite-dimensional superalgebras are studied.The formulation of the higher-spin superalgebras is described in termsof symbols of operators by Berezin. We hope that this formulation willprovide in future the powerful tool for constructing the complete solutionof the higher-spin problem, the problem of introducing a consistent gravitationalinteraction for massless higher-spin fields (s andgt; 2).</TEXT></DOC>
