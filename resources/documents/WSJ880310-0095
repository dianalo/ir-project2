Yesterday's U.S. announcement had been expected after administration officials said this week they believe China is no longer providing Silkworm missiles to Iran. The decision to renew the trade-liberalization plan &quot;reaffirms U.S. opportunities in this trade and gives a boost to its potential growth,&quot; a Commerce Department official said.    The liberalization won't take place for some time, but the U.S. expects its effects on trade to be felt sooner. In the five months since the U.S. protested the missile sales by suspending the technology-liberalization plan, there has been a &quot;general slowdown&quot; in the licensing of China-bound exports, said Roger Sullivan, vice president of the National Council for U.S.-China Trade.    U.S. officials said the list of items that the administration proposes allowing China to receive will undergo an interagency review before being sent to the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, the Paris-based body that devises common export-control policies for the U.S., 14 European allies and Japan. Under Cocom rules, the U.S. can't act unilaterally.    U.S. officials said the plan generally would raise the level of technology that the West can sell China. It also would clarify the discretion each Cocom member can exercise in deciding whether to grant export licenses for borderline products. U.S. exporters have complained that other countries interpret the Cocom rules more liberally than the U.S. does, giving them an advantage over U.S. exporters.    The focus of the proposed rule changes on telecommunications will please such U.S. companies as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and ITT Corp. which already have a strong foothold in the growing China market.    These companies could have been among those hurt by the Silkworm controversy. Mark Rosenker, a spokesman for the Electronic Industries Association, a U.S. trade group, said European and Japanese companies have been seeking to make inroads in the Chinese market by suggesting that it would be more difficult for Chinese buyers to get licenses to buy U.S. goods.    U.S. industry lobbyists are trying to get the Cocom rules changed in time for a Beijing exhibition of telecommunications equipment in late October. </TEXT></DOC>
