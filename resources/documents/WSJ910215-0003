The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 31.93, or 1.1%,to 2877.23. It was the industrials' largest decline sinceJan. 9, when the average fell 39.11.</LP><TEXT>   Some broader indexes touched new highs in intradaytrading, but the computer-guided selling late in the day leftthem below Wednesday's records.   The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.80, or 1.30%,to 364.22; the New York Stock Exchange composite lost 2.26 to198.92, a decline of 1.12%.   Traders said it appeared that some big futures speculatorsoperating through New York brokerage houses hit the ChicagoSandamp;P pit with sell orders for several hundred contracts around2:30 p.m. EST. Index futures quickly slipped to a discount inrelation to the 500 stocks that make up the Sandamp;P index. That'swhen index arbitragers sold stocks and bought futures to takeadvantage of the price discrepancy, sending stocks abruptlylower.   The late sell-off &quot;was almost entirely futures and optionsrelated,&quot; one New York floor trader said. &quot;They sold stockshere against an arbitrage {in Chicago}. It was carpetbombing.&quot;   Today, traders are bracing for more program tradingbecause of the monthly expiration of stock-index futures andoptions.   Arnold Kaufman, editor of Sandamp;P's Outlook newsletter, saidinvestors can expect setbacks on the way to new highs in thestock market. But he said: &quot;As we get closer to the end ofthe quarter, money managers who haven't invested will bescrambling to get a piece of the market. And I think thatwill make any correction modest.&quot;   Steven Einhorn, chairman of the investment policycommittee at Goldman Sachs, said he sees several reasons forstock prices to continue rising, even if they give back a fewpercentage points occasionally.   He cited the Federal Reserve's current posture of&quot;vigorous accommodation&quot; as it tries to prod the economy outof a recession; evidence that inflation has peaked on ayear-to-year basis; and his belief that corporate profits arelikely to bottom out this quarter.   &quot;Down days should be a correction in a bull market ratherthan anything more substantive,&quot; Mr. Einhorn said.   Although the market was broadly down yesterday afternoon,there were few signs among stock groups that any largeinstitutions were bailing out of stocks.
