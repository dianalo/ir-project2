(MTCI)to perform research and development required to assemble and test a pilotscale, modular, 0.25 ton per hour (tph) black liquor recovery system.MTCI has developed a proprietary pulse-enhanced, indirect, steam gasificationtechnology. The MTCI indirect gasification recovery process is carriedout at relatively low temperatures, avoiding ``smelt'' and the possibilityfor explosions and also reducing capital costs and improves energy productivitysignificantly. This award will provide funds to continue development ofthe technique and apply it to a 0.25 ton per hour black liquor recoverypilot system.Project Scope: MTCI will perform research on process characterization testingand field tests of a 0.25 ton per hour pilot-scale, modular, black liquorrecovery system on transportable pallets. The MTCI will research and developa high throughput modular system that produces a medium BTU gas with aflame temperature almost identical to natural gas. The approach is basedon MTCI proprietary indirectly heated thermochemical reactor technologythat significantly enhances heat and mass transfer in reactors. Also, itwould eliminate the product gas diluents of partial oxidation or oxygen-blowngasification systems. MTCI's developmental program has carefully adheredto scientific and engineering principles, thereby providing a well documentedtechnology data base that provide creditable and reproducible informationsubstantiating the value and merit of its unique and innovative process.Eligibility for the award of this cooperative agreement is being limitedto MTCI because of the unique technique that has been developed. No otherresearch facility has demonstrated the skill, technical expertise, facilitiesand resources which are required in order to provide a pulse-enhanced,indirect, black liquor gasifier pilot system. The term of this cooperative agreement is for two years and will commenceOctober 16, 1989 and end October 15, 1991. The total estimated cost ofthis award is $1,726,992 with DOE providing $1,285,629.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>U.S. Department of Energy, Conservationand Renewable Energy, Improved Energy Productivity Branch, ATTN: StanleyF.
