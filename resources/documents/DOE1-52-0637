This techniquemakes it possible to study the movement of the target insects withinsimulated or natural soil blocks over time. This method also shows physicalproperties of the soil matrix: particle size, extent of compaction, differencesin soil moisture, horizons, and random soil heterogeneity. Blocks ofsoil up to 14&quot; x 17&quot; x 5&quot; have been removed from the field and x-rayedin my laboratory using this technique. These radiographs are of sufficientquality to determine the movement of white grubs in situ. Such blocksretain their field characteristics and therefore allow for the carefulmonitoring and manipulation of the system over relatively long (severalmonths) periods of time. Radiographic data are presented which documentthe behavior of several white grub species in response to dynamic soilecosystem processes such as moisture and temperature flux. Additionaldata on the effects of specific soil insecticides on the behavior ofwhite grubs in the soil and the movement of these insecticides throughthe soil profile are also presented. The importance of understandingthe dynamic interaction of soil insect and soil insecticide providedthrough x-ray technology, both in understanding white grub behavior inthe field and maximizing management efforts is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
