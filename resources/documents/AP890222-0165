The launch went smoothly and the satellite, named EXOS-D, enteredits orbit as planned, said the official from the Institute of Spaceand Astronautical Science.   EXOS-D, the 12th scientific satellite launched by thegovernment-sponsored agency, will study the Earth's auroras andtheir relationship to plasma particles emitted by the sun, she said.   Auroras are luminous displays, usually seen around the north andsouth poles, believed to be caused by collisions of chargedparticles from the sun and oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the Earth'satmosphere. The 660-pound satellite contains eight devices to studyand photograph auroras and plasma waves, the official said.   The satellite's elliptical orbit is expected to range from 250miles to 6,250 miles.   Japan limits its rocket launches to only 90 days a year _ 45 daysin July and August and 45 days in January and February _ because ofprotests from tuna fishermen in the area of the space center, offJapan's southern main island of Kyushu. The fishermen say rocketlaunches are dangerous.   Japan entered the aerospace field late because of restrictionsimposed by U.S. occupation forces after World War II, but hasadvanced quickly in recent years with a high success rate.</TEXT></DOC>
