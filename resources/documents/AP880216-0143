James W. Glosser, acting administrator of the department'sAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said a permit for thefield test was issued to E. I. du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co.,Wilmington, Del. The company expects to begin testing this springnear Brandenton, Fla.   The genetically engineered plants were designed to toleratesulfonylurea, described as a new class of low-risk chemical weedkillers. Glosser said his agency ``completed a thorough review ofthe methodology and scientific data and determined that the testswould not have a significant impact on the environment.''   By using plants that can withstand herbicides, farmers couldkill weeds without having to worry about hurting their crops.   The du Pont field trial is the third test approved by the USDAagency. Previously, permits were issued to Calgene Inc., Davis,Calif., for tobacco and tomato plants that tolerate the herbicidesbromoxynil and glyphosate.   Glosser said the field tests are all similar. Two groups ofplants _ one genetically engineered and the other conventionallygrown _ are sprayed with the same herbicide.</TEXT></DOC>
