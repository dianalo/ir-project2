He'd never make it as a tax adviser.    With enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, tax specialists are advising most of their philanthropic-minded clients to give -- and to do it before the end of the year. &quot;Most people are going to be in a lower tax bracket in 1987,&quot; says Conrad Teitell, a Connecticut tax attorney. &quot;Therefore,&quot; he adds, &quot;a deduction you take this year is worth more.&quot;    True, each taxpayer's situation is unique. Those who expect to be taxed at a higher rate next year -- because of a salary increase, the alternative minimum tax or some other factor -- may want to delay some charitable gifts until 1987.    But in general, tax advisers say, the tax law that takes effect on Jan. 1 will make giving to charity more expensive than it is now. As a result, they say, this is the year for most taxpayers to think about increasing donations, contributing appreciated property instead of cash and setting up trusts to benefit their favorite charities.    Properly handled, advisers say, such techniques can help taxpayers support their favorite causes, reduce current tax liabilities and, in some cases, provide givers with income in the future, when top tax rates are lower.    Bigger Gifts   It makes sense for many donors who had planned to give money next year to give it this year instead. That's because a $100 charitable contribution that currently takes just $50 out of the pocket of a donor in the 50% tax bracket, will cost $61.50 when the top marginal rate drops to 38.5% next year. In addition, taxpayers who don't itemize will no longer be able to take any charitable deduction.    Tax advisers say it could even make sense for some cash-poor donors to fund bigger 1986 gifts with a credit-card advance. Those who do will get the charitable deduction now and interest deductions later. Although the deduction for consumer interest is being phased out over the next five years, donors can still deduct 65% of the interest they pay on their 1987 tax returns and lesser amounts in later years.    Appreciated Property   This year donors can deduct the full fair-market value of gifts of appreciated property -- such as securities or real estate -- that has been held for six months or longer and not have to pay capital gains tax on the appreciation. Starting next year, that appreciation will be a so-called &quot;tax-preference item&quot; that could subject a taxpayer to the alternative minimum tax. That would mean a higher tax liability than under the regular tax rates, raising the cost of the gift.    Under both current law and the new tax act, the amount donors can deduct for gifts of appreciated property is limited to 30% of their adjusted gross incomes. So a donor whose adjusted income is $100,000, can deduct no more than $30,000 in any one year. But donors may still want to give more than that because the law allows them to deduct the excess over the next five years. For example, a donor who contributed $50,000 of securities this year could deduct $30,000 for 1986 and $20,000 for 1987.    The catch for some taxpayers is that carrying over the surplus deductions on gifts made after Aug. 16 would make the appreciated portion of those gifts a preference item that could subject the taxpayer to the alternative minimum tax in 1987 and later years.    There is, however, a way for donors of appreciated property to increase their current deduction to 50% of adjusted gross income and avoid the alternative minimum tax: The contribution of appreciated property can, in effect, be treated as a cash contribution. To do this, the taxpayer elects to reduce the claimed appreciation by 40% -- the portion that would have been taxable at ordinary income-tax rates had the donor sold the appreciated property and given cash instead.    Consider the case of the woman with adjusted gross income of $100,000 a year who donates securities acquired for $200,000 and now valued at $400,000 to her favorite charity. Under the basic, 30% limit, she could deduct no more than $30,000 for 1986 and for each of the next five years -- a total of only $180,000 through 1991.    But it's possible to increase the total deductions to $300,000 in the same period on the same $400,000 gift. She simply reduces the value of her deduction to $320,000 -- subtracting 40% of the $200,000 appreciation. She may then deduct $50,000 for this year and for each of the next five years. Moreover, $100,000 of the deductions will come in the higher-tax years 1986 and 1987, before the top rate falls to 33%.    Charitable Remainder Trusts   Taxpayers can contribute income-producing assets without giving up the income. To do this, they put the assets in a remainder trust and name themselves as the beneficiary of a specified amount of the income (either a percent of the assets or an actual dollar amount). Whatever is left when they die, the remainder, goes to a previously designated charity. Because of the costs and complexities, says Paul L. Comstock, who heads a financial advisory firm in Houston, $100,000 is about the smallest practical size for a charitable remainder trust.    Consider a donor who puts $100,000 in trust for his alma mater and sets an annual 7% payout rate for himself. Each year, he receives $7,000 in taxable income from the trust. If the trust earns less than $7,000, the deficit is made up by dipping into the principal; earnings above 7% would increase the principal. When the donor dies, what's left goes to the school.    The donor's deduction this year is the amount left after subtracting the present value of the income that the donor will receive in his remaining lifetime from the amount originally put in the trust.    The trust also allows the donor to shelter the retained, or undistributed, profits the assets in the trust earn so that more of the proceeds can be invested for future income. Assume a donor paid $10,000 for a piece of property, now worth $100,000. If he sold the property this year, he would have to pay a capital-gains tax as high as 20% on the appreciation, which would leave just $82,000 to reinvest. But if the same property is put in a charitable trust, the trustees can sell it and invest the entire $100,000. The reason: The property is, in effect, owned by a charitable organization, which doesn't have to pay taxes.    Similarly, any surplus income that is added to the principal is also exempt from taxes. Thus, the assets in the trust can appreciate more quickly than they could in the donor's personal portfolio. &quot;It's a great planning tool for people nearing retirement age, because you get more money working for you,&quot; Mr. Comstock says.    Charitable Lead Trusts   The name comes from the fact that the charity leads, rather than follows, the donor in getting money from these trusts. Donors who put their assets in a lead trust can name a charitable organization as the beneficiary of the income for a specified number of years. At the end of that period, the assets revert to the donor. The donor gets a deduction now -- when tax rates are higher and deductions worth more -- equal to the present value of the income that will go to the charity over that period.    Suppose a donor in the 50% bracket creates a five-year lead trust that will pay $10,000 a year for each of the next five years to her church's building fund. She gets an immediate deduction of $37,908, the present value of the $50,000. Her immediate tax savings from this deduction will be 50%, or $18,954.    The donor remains liable for taxes on the income generated by the trust, because she continues to own its assets. But she can avoid those taxes simply by funding the trust with tax-exempt bonds. </TEXT></DOC>
