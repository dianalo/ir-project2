Based on this assessment, the Under Secretaryfor Export Administration has determined that there exists foreign availabilityof such equipment, within the meaning of section 5(f) of the Export AdministrationAct of 1979, as amended.

The Bureau of Export Administration also willbegin the process whereby the United States Government will work with COCOMmember governments to reach agreement on an orderly change in the multilateralcontrols placed on such Nd:YAG surgical lasers when exported to controlledcountries.
