The move marks a break with Israeli military tradition in whichtroops are trained mainly as combat soldiers for conventionalwarfare.   The new special force is intended to get regular combat troopsout of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and back to standardtraining programs, said Col. Renaan Gissin, the army's deputy chiefspokesman.   Gissin said two experimental special companies have beenoperating in the occupied territories for several months. Theirformation followed complaints by some officers that duty in theterritories was cutting into regular training.   The decision to form a permanent new unit was made after theexperimental companies proved effective in dealing with Palestinianswho have been waging an uprising against Israeli rule in landsoccupied in the 1967 Middle East war, Gissin said.   At least 19 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were injuredWednesday in new clashes in the occupied territories.   In the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, two soldiers were injuredby stones and 11 Palestinians were shot and wounded when troopsopened fire during a stone-throwing melee, the army and Arab reportssaid.   Six Palestinians were shot and wounded in three other clashes inthe seaside strip.   An army spokesman confirmed two Arabs wounded in the West Bankand said the military was investigating other reports.   At least 554 Palestinians have been killed in clashes withsoldiers or Israeli civilians during the uprising. Thirty-eightIsraeli also have been slain.   ``These units will spend most of their service in one place,''Gissin said, adding ``they will know the area and the populationbetter than troops that rotate in and out every three or fourmonths.''   The special unit, dubbed the ``territories companies,'' willreceive specialized training on how to deal with stone- andfirebomb-throwing youths attacking troops in cities and villages,Gissin said.   He said they would operate better in such situations than eliteinfantry units, trained to fight regular forces on a battlefield orguerrillas attempting to infiltrate into the country.   The daily Al-Hamishmar reported that new recruits are reluctantto be sent to the experimental forces, which did more police dutiesthan the more glamorous combat units. But Gissin denied the report.   ``We have had no problem in recruiting men and do not expect anywhen we enlarge the unit,'' he said.   All Israeli men do three years of compulsory military duty andserve in the reserves for up to 60 days a year until the age of 54,often in the occupied territories. Most women serve for two years innon-combat units and later in the reserves until the age of 24.   Gissin said the possibility of hurting soldiers' morale by havingthem spend the majority of their three-year military service amonghostile civilians had been thoroughly examined by militarypsychologists.   ``Of course we examined the issue and we are confident thesoldiers will be OK,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
