This is nothing more than a militarymanipulation exercise. We've nothing to celebrate until the entirebase is shut and restored as common land.''   A U.S. Air Force transport plane flew out the first group of the96 missiles at Greenham Common, 50 miles west of London.   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said 16missiles were removed Tuesday but the Air Force refused to disclosea number.   The missiles are to be destroyed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Basein Arizona, the Air Force said.   All the missiles are to be removed by 1991 under the U.S.-Sovietintermediate weapons arms control treaty signed in 1987.   Anti-nuclear campaigners established a peace camp outside thebase in 1981, but the protests gained prominence after thedeployment of the cruise missiles on Nov. 14, 1983.   At the height of the protests, 35,000 women encircled the base.   On Tuesday, about a hundred women appeared around the base, anda few climbed over the barbed-wire atop the base's fences beforebeing rounded up by military police.   ``Greenham will remain a focus of non-violence. We are notimpressed with this publicity gimmick. As long as military weaponsare in this country we will be here,'' said Elizabeth Junor.   ``It is a victory for the women at the camp who have stayed hereyear in and year out and kept the issue in the public light,'' saidAnn Harris, who brought a bottle of champagne. ``It isn't the endbut it's a great day.''   One woman, Stephanie Johnson, had come to the base hoping to saygoodbye to more than the missiles.   ``I'll be glad to see the back of them and those bloody women,''she said. ``I support what they are doing but they have made such amess of the area they will not be missed.''</TEXT></DOC>
