The broadcast also said government defenders killed 32 rebelfighters around the besieged garrison town of Khost, about 10 mileswest of the Pakistani border.   The radio, monitored in Islamabad, blamed the Kabul rocket attackon U.S-backed insurgents headquartered in Pakistan.   In other reports Wednesday, guerrilla sources in Pakistan claimedthey shot down a transport plane attempting to resupply Khost. Theysaid the plane was shot down Wednesday with sophisticatedAmerican-supplied anti-aircraft Stinger missiles.   They also said they downed a Soviet-made jetfighter.   The guerrillas launched an offensive against the heavilyfortified government garrison at Khost earlier this month. A rebelvictory at Khost would open a direct supply link from Pakistan toguerrilla fighters in northern and western Afghanistan.   The insurgents have also been battering Kabul with almost dailyrocket attacks since June, killing more than 300 people and injuring700.   However, they have failed to capture a major city since theSoviets withdrew their last troops in February. Moscow continues tosupply the Kabul government with weapons.
