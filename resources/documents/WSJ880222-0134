The company forecasts that net will grow 60% for the year to about 45 cents.    For the quarter, the medical-equipment maker estimated net climbed to more than $350,000 from $112,000 in the year-earlier period, which ended Dec. 31. Sales advanced to about $5.5 million from $4 million.    Although fiscal 1988 ends a month later than the prior year, earnings figures are comparable, Novametrix said. About 3.7 million shares are outstanding, roughly the same as last year.    William J. Lacourciere, president and chief operating officer, said that the market for equipment to monitor oxygen and carbon dioxide has &quot;exploded&quot; in the past four years.    The company markets pulse monitors, which currently account for about half its business; transcutaneous, or skin, monitors, which together with certain other equipment accounts for about 30%; and capnographs, or respiratory monitors, which account for 20%.    Mr. Lacourciere said in an interview that for year ending April 30, he expects sales to increase 35% to about $21.5 million from $15.9 million in fiscal 1987, which ended March 31; net to climb 60% to more than $1.6 million from $1 million; and per-share earnings to reach about 45 cents from 28 cents.    The strengthening of the company's markets is attributable to greater medical-community interest and to the demands of liability insurance carriers that operating-room physicians continuously monitor oxygen and carbon dioxide, he said.    Although in November 1987, Novatmetrix was authorized to periodically buy as much as $1.5 million of its shares, Mr. Lacourciere said he hoped the company wouldn't need to do so. It would buy the shares only if the stock needed support, he said. Also, Novametrix has no plans to offer stock or debentures or to split its stock in the near future. </TEXT></DOC>
