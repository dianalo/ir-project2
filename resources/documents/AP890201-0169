VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A handful of senators complaining about howmuch time is spent on raising campaign money said Wednesday theywant a constitutional amendment to let Congress set limits on thecosts of running for office.   ``Public office all too often goes to the highest bidder, thehighest spender,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., whose 1986re-election campaign was among the most expensive in U.S. history.   The constitutional amendment was introduced by Sen. Ernest F.Hollings, D-S.C., and backed by Cranston and six other senators. Itwould allow Congress and state governments to ``set reasonablelimits on campaign expenditures.''   Hollings, who backed a similar amendment in the last Congress,said the amendment was needed because of a Supreme Court decisionstriking down attempts to limit campaign spending, saying it wouldinfringe on rights of free speech.   ``If you're rich, you have freedom of speech,'' Hollings said.``If you're poor, you have the freedom to shut up.''   If the amendment were passed by Congress and ratified by thestate legislatures, Hollings said the laws actually imposing thelimits would then be drafted.   He said Congress would need to go to work to eliminate practicesof raising ``soft money'' _ funds gathered by political parties forpresidential campaigns _ and ``bundling,'' a mechanism that allowsthe parties to bypass spending limits on congressional campaigns.   Coincidentally, the Federal Election Commission on Wednesdayannounced that the National Republican Senatorial Committee agreedto pay a $20,000 fine for its handling of a 1986 fund-raisingcampaign for a dozen Senate candidates to which then-Vice PresidentBush lent his support.   The commission found that the committee, set up by the RepublicanParty to assist in electing GOP senatorial candidates, violatedfederal election law because it did not charge the candidates forthe cost of the fund-raising effort.   However, the six-member commission deadlocked over a relatedquestion of whether the senatorial committee broke the law by theway it funneled more than $2.7 million in campaign contributions tothe 12 candidates.   Republican Senate candidates in Alabama, Arkansas, California,Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, NorthCarolina, South Dakota and Vermont were on the receiving end of thefunnel.   The commission's decision, which was reached last year but wasnot released until Wednesday, dealt with bundling, a tactic used bypolitical committees to gather funds from individual contributorsand then channel the money to a particular candidate specified bythe donor.   The practice allows organizations to bypass provisions in the lawsetting limits on how much money they can give a candidate. Underthe law, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and theRepublican National Committee can give no more than a total of$17,500 to a Senate candidate.   The elections laws permit political organizations to act as aconduit for contributions to candidates as long as the organizationdoes not exert enough control over the money to channel the cash towhomever it chooses.   One fund-raising letter sent out by the committee and signed byBush asked for contributions for the Senate candidates in SouthDakota, Nevada, Louisiana and California.   Bush's letter warned that if the four Republicans in those states``don't raise at least $236,500 in the next 21 days _ they'll lose.''   ``It's that simple _ and that frightening,'' Bush wrote in theSept. 2, 1986, letter. ``That's why I'm counting on you to rush meyour check for $25 by return mail today.''   All four of those candidates ended up losing.   Lawrence M. Noble, the general counsel for the FEC, argued thatthe Republican committee's fund-raising program ``was carefullydesigned to channel receipts in ways determined by (the committee)itself.''   Stuart Gerson, an attorney for the GOP in the case, said thedonor, not the committee, is in control of the funds.   ``After all, they write the checks, the party committee doesnot,'' Gerson said. ``Once the donor gives, the committee has nochoice but to forward that to the candidate within the appropriateperiod of time.''   While the commission failed to support Noble's argument on thatpoint, it did find that the Republican committee should havedeclared that the $608,568 cost of its fund-raising effort shouldhave been counted itself as a contribution to the Senate candidates'campaigns.</TEXT></DOC>
