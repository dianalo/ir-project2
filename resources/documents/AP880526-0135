Meetings on the remaining issues resumed today between theSenate's leaders and senior members of the Foreign Relations, ArmedServices and Intelligence committees.   ``I'm very optimistic about finishing this matter,'' said SenateMinority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who noted that the areas ofdisagreement had been whittled down to two or three. ``I'mconfident that everybody is going in the same direction,'' he said.   The Senate, on a vote of 96-0, today approved an amendmentincorporating into the treaty agreements reached two weeks ago inGeneva by Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard Shevardnadze, dealing with warheads using``futuristic'' technology and clarifying on-site verification rules.   Leaders had conferred late into Wednesday night in an effort tosettle what appeared to be the thorniest dispute, one between theadministration and the Senate over possible future reinterpretationof the treaty.   ``We're not there yet, but we've made a good deal of progress,''said Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.   A key to progress on the treaty was the decision on Wednesday bythe leading opponent of the pact, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to drophis delaying tactics. Helms said he did so in the face of aprobable vote by the Senate to shut off debate.   ``That was the end of it,'' Helms conceded in a floor speech.``I've had no illusions about defeating this treaty. The Americanpeople are beginning to understand that this is a dangeroustreaty.''   Helms' concession ended more than a week of delay and raisedhopes that the accord could be approved in time to be shipped toMoscow so that President Reagan could formally exchangeratification documents with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev atthe summit meeting that begins Sunday.   The primary remaining issue did not affect the treaty itself,but the modified conditions under which the Senate would grant itsconsent.   Democrats sought to attach a condition stipulating that anyattempt by a future president to reinterpret the treaty would haveto be approved by the Senate in order to become effective.   Backers of the change have said it is an attempt to preserve theSenate's constitutional power of advise and consent on treaties.The debate stems from a dispute with the Reagan administration overits attempt to reinterpret the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty topermit more latitude in developing Reagan's Star Wars missiledefense.   That treaty with the Soviet Union was the last arms-control pactto win Senate approval.   The treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces, which Reaganand Gorbachev signed in Washington on Dec. 8, requires eliminationwithin three years of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles with a rangeof 300 miles to 3,400 miles. It would result in the elimination of867 U.S. missiles in Europe and elimination of 1,752 Sovietmissiles.   While the treaty is regarded as militarily insignificant becauseit leaves most of both sides' nuclear arsenals intact, it holdspotentially great political significance as a model for a follow-uptreaty to provide for deep cuts in long-range nuclear missiles.   As leaders wrangled throughout the day Wednesday in an effort toclear remaining procedural hurdles, the Senate approved a pair ofrelatively mild amendments to the accord and overwhelminglydefeated two others.   On a voice vote, the lawmakers approved a non-binding provisionurging negotiators in future talks on reductions in long-rangemissile arsenals not to give up the U.S. right to maintain stocksof conventionally armed air- and sea-launched cruise missiles.   And the Senate urged the president to keep human rights in theforefront of U.S.-Soviet relations and ``insist on sustained anddemonstrable human rights progress.'' That language was added on avoice vote.   Helms was rebuffed in an attempt to add a provision stipulatingthat if either side provided ``materially misleading or falsedata,'' the other side would be free to withdraw from the treaty.The amendment failed on a vote of 89-9.   And Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., failed on a 69-28 vote to winan exemption from the ban for conventionally armed cruise missiles.Hollings argued that keeping such missiles in the allied arsenalwould help offset Warsaw Pact superiority in conventional forces,but opponents pointed out it would be impossible to verify that themissiles were not nuclear-tipped.</TEXT></DOC>
