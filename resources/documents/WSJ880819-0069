The Bank of England said bank and building-society loans jumped a record #9 billion ($15.23 billion) last month, up from an increase of #8.8 billion in June and #5.32 billion in July 1987. Building societies are U.K. mortgage-lending associations.    The U.K. central bank also said the broad measure of money supply known as M-4 rose about 2.1% in July, after a 1.9% gain in June. The narrow measure of money supply, called M-0, grew 0.9% in July compared with an increase of 1.1% in June. The narrow money supply's annual growth rate stands at 7%, above the government's target ceiling of 5% for fiscal 1989 ending next March 31.    The lending and money-supply increases, though sharp, matched economists' forecasts. London markets shrugged off the data. The numbers were swollen somewhat by U.K. home buyers who rushed to take advantage of mortgage-interest tax incentives that end this month.    Monetary officials here have voiced alarm recently over signs of sharp inflationary pressures in the British economy. In an attempt to cool overheating, the government has directed seven increases in banks' base rates since early June. Base rates stand at 11%.    Although private economists expect base rates to rise to 12% this year, yesterday's figures didn't seem to provide grounds for an immediate increase.    &quot;The situation is probably on hold,&quot; said Mark Cliffe, an economist at Nomura Research Institute in London. The markets' calm reaction to the money-supply figures &quot;gives the {monetary} authorities the leeway to avoid raising base rates -- immediately at least,&quot; he added.    Other data showed average earnings in Britain rose at an annual rate of 8.5% in June, unchanged from the previous month and in line with forecasts. Economists have fretted over inflationary pressures from high wage settlements this year.    Unemployment fell to a provisional 8.2% in July from a revised 8.4% in June.    Attention will turn to U.K. trade figures for July, which the government announces Thursday. Economists predict the figures will show a current-account deficit of #1 billion, slightly narrower than the #1.02 billion in June. The current account measures the balance of international payments, including imports and exports of goods and services and certain transfers. </TEXT></DOC>
