 It monitors any programs thatterminate and attempt to stay resident.andP;  RVi-Spy monitors warm-boot requests,tells the users to be sure the floppy-drive doors are open, then performs acold boot to clear the RAM.andM;Vi-Spy installation was simple, although the AUTOEXEC.BAT file must bemanually altered.andP;  When Vi-Spy is run, it performs a self-check and displaysa memory map that shows all drivers and programs in RAM.andP;  This map, as wellas the boot record and partition tables, is compared with subsequent versionsto determine whether internal changes have been made.andP;  Vi-Spy then scans theboot record, partition tables and files for viruses.andM;When it finds a virus, Vi-Spy offers to delete it, which is performed byoverwriting the file seven times and then erasing it.andP;  The results of thescan are shown at the end of the process.andP;  A separate program, VSRecovr,remove viruses from the boot record and partition tables, using stored data.andM;When working with a floppy drive that can detect disk changes, RVi-Spy willautomatically start a Vi-Spy scan when a new floppy disk is accessed througha DOS command.andP;  RVi-Spy also issues a warning any time a program goesresident in memory.andM;If the boot sector of the hard disk is infected, Vi-Spy's preferred solutionis a low-level format.andP;  The other, less drastic alternative is possible withVSRecovr.andP;  VSRecovr is used only to recover the boot sector and the partitiontable.andP;  If Vi-Spy's &quot;saved&quot; information is available from a previous run,VSRecovr will replace the infected partition table and boot sector with theold partition table.andP;  Vi-Spy also offers the unique feature of detecting ZIPand ARC files that must be unpacked before scanning.andM;Vi-Spy detected and was able to remove most of the tested viruses.andP;  It failedto recognize files infected with the Invader, Taiwan3, Virus 101 and Whaleviruses.andP;  It also failed to prevent infection by any of the viruses, but itdid issue warnings when 1701, 4096 and Jerusalem went resident in systemmemory.andM;----------RG Software Systems Inc.andM;Scottsdale, Ariz.andP;  (602) 423-8000andM;Privately heldandM;Year established: 1984andM;Number of employees: 5andM;Gross annual revenue: NotandM;disclosedandM;Gross annual earnings: NotandM;disclosedandM;Source: Information supplied by company.andM;Jim Quraishi is a technical consultant for Ziff Communications Co.andM;SiteLock, from Brightwork Development Inc., does not remove viruses, but itis the first antiviral application to be integrated within a networkoperating system.andM;The package, priced at $495 per file server, is loaded as a value-addedprocess (VAP) on Novell Inc.'s NetWare 286 and as a NetWare Loadable Module(NLM) on NetWare 386, allowing a system administrator to play Big Brother.andM;SiteLock can prevent users who are connected to the network from runningcertain software packages and any software from local drives of workstations.andO;In addition, SiteLock can meter software usage and limit the number ofconcurrent users to the number specified in the software license.andM;As virus protection, SiteLock is fairly basic.andP;  It takes a signature of everyprogram and, if the signature has been changed, it will not allow the programto be executed.andP;  This is an inadequate solution, because it's easy forviruses to infect programs without changing their signatures.andM;Still, SiteLock's implementation as a VAP and an NLM is a step in the rightdirection.andP;  With improved antiviral support, SiteLock could be a prominentrelease.andM;Brightwork Development Inc. of Tinton Falls, N.J., can be reached at (201)530-0440.andP;  --  --  J.Q.andP;  and  J.M.andM;PC Week Labs tested the antiviral products in single-system and LANconfigurations.andP;  The single-system tests were performed on a Compaq ComputerCorp.andP;  Deskpro 286 PC with 640K bytes of RAM running DOS 3.3 and on an IBMPS/2 Model 80 386 with 4M bytes of RAM running DOS 4.0 and OS/2.andM;To determine the packages' capacity to detect inactive virus-infected files,the viruses 512 (Number of the Beast), 1701 (Cascade), 4096 (Israeli DefenseForces), Fish, Invader, Jerusalem (Israeli or Friday 13th), Taiwan3, Virus101 (Patrick Toulme) and Whale were installed on the hard drive.andM;Each antiviral product was installed on the hard drive and tested for itsability to detect virus-infected files.andP;  Programs were then tested byexecuting files infected with the Jerusalem, 1701 and 4096 viruses, and bybooting from a floppy disk infected with the Stoned boot-infector virus.andM;Each product was tested for its ability to prevent, detect and clean up viralinfections on local hard drives and network drives.andP;  To test preventioncapabilities, each antiviral program was loaded from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file,and a virus-infected program was then executed.andP;  Any messages from theantiviral program were noted; the computer was then cold-booted and scannedfor any infection.andM;To test for detection capability, a virus was loaded, and at least fiveprograms were infected.andP;  The antiviral programs were then used to detect eachof the infected programs.andP;  The infected programs were also used in thecleanup test.andP;  Each of the products either removed viral code from theinfected program or boot sector and restored it to its original state, ordeleted the infected file.andM;Networking capabilities were tested by setting up Microsoft Corp.'s LANManager, Sitka Corp.'s TOPS, and Novell Inc.'s NetWare 286 and NetWare 386file servers.andP;  A Tangent 386 PC with 2M bytes of RAM and a IBM PS/2 Model 80386 with 4M bytes of RAM were used as workstations.andM;The tested viruses were installed on the file server, and the directory wasmapped as a logical drive on the workstation.andM;After the cleanup, disinfected files were compared to the original ones, andboot sectors were scanned to ensure the viruses had been removed.andP;
