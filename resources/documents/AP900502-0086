It looks like Lithuania has gotten the message. No country willcome to the Baltic country's defense in its present confrontationwith the Soviet Union. Not even the United States, which we allknow likes to sound off that there's nothing better on earth thandemocracy and freedom.   President Bush last week began by sounding tough on the SovietUnion's plan to make Lithuania knuckle under by shutting offsupplies of oil, natural gas and other vital materials to the smallrepublic.   But when the time came to enact trade sanctions against theSoviets in support of Lithuania, Bush did a repeat of his Beijingwaltz. He finally declared it was not in the best interest offurther U.S.-Soviet Union peace moves to help Lithuania, despiteall his earlier sympathetic talk about Lithuania's desire forindependence.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 30   Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News on Lithuania:   A lot of people want President George Bush to get tough withMikhail Gorbachev about Soviet pressure on tiny Lithuania. We thinkBush has been wise to adopt a cautious and restrained stance. He isreally not in a position to help Lithuania very much, but he coulddo great damage to the progress toward democracy in Eastern Europe.   We doubt that the most vocal critics of Bush's policy havereally thought much about the consequences if their advice wasfollowed. Some, we suspect, are just posturing in support of whatthey conceive to be a popular cause.   It is easy to sympathize with the Lithuanians, annexed by forceto a huge nation that oppressed and impoverished them. But in atime of soaring expectations it is easy to expect too much.   The peoples of Eastern Europe have made tremendous stridestoward freedom that were unimaginable little more than a year ago.Things are moving swiftly in the right direction. It would beunwise to throw a monkey wrench into the process at this point.What would be gained by doing so?</TEXT><TEXT>   April 26   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on Lithuania:   By playing tough guy, Mikhail Gorbachev is winning importantpoints with Moscow hard-liners, who view any attempt to leave thefederation as a dire threat to the integrity of the USSR as a whole.   President Bush's decision _ outward decision, that is _ to keephands-off gives ... Gorbachev carte blanche to do whatever isnecessary, short of invasion, to keep Lithuania in the fold.   Helping ... Gorbachev maintain his political equilibrium maysatisfy Washington's geopolitical interests, but it does notaddress the moral dilemma the United States faces. An angry(Lithuanian) President Landsbergis raised serious questions when,responding to ... Bush, he said: ``Can the freedom of one group ofpeople be sold for the freedom of another?
