The two sides fought sporadic clashes late Monday, with someprotesters hurling gasoline bombs at troops, who responded withgunfire. Automatic weapons fire was heard from Seikkyi, across theRangoon River from the capital, and smoke could be seen billowingfrom the village.   At least 150 people were killed in the capital during protestsagainst Sunday's coup, which was led by armed forces commander Gen.Saw Maung. No casualty figures were available from other cities,where clashes were also reported.   Today, downtown streets appeared deserted, peopled only withsome soldiers clearing roadblocks demonstrators had erected andresidents hurrying home after buying food at a few small shops.   Most troops remained inside government buildings.   Opposition leaders said they called off street protests to avoidfurther bloodshed. They said government workers would protest bycontinuing their strikes past Sept. 26, the new military regime'sdeadline for returning to work on threat of dismissal.   It was the first day without street demonstrations in thecapital since a round of rallies and strikes called to press for anend to 26 years of repressive one-party rule began on Aug. 8 andtoppled hard-line President Sein Lwin four days later.   Saw Maung said he ousted President Maung Maung on Sunday in abid to halt economic and social chaos and ensure democraticelections _ which Maung had promised.   Maung Maung, who took over Aug. 19 as Burma's first civilianleader since 1962, had ended martial law and withdrawn soldiersfrom the streets in the start of a series of concessions toprotesters.   Troops returned in force after Saw Maung took power and enforcedhis ban on public gatherings by shooting monks, students, strikinggovernment workers and other unarmed demonstrators in Rangoon.   Reporters who witnessed the confrontations said at least 100people were killed on Monday, some of them shot by soldiers perchedon rooftops.   About 40 demonstrators and 17 soldiers died in clashes aroundthe capital on Sunday night.   Demonstrations also broke out in other cities, includingMandalay, the second largest city in Burma.   An Asian diplomat quoted doctors as saying 67 victims were takento Rangoon General Hospital on Monday. A military spokesman saidincomplete reports showed 23 people were killed and 23 wounded inRangoon and three other towns.   Three key opposition leaders, reacting to the killings, vowed ina joint statement Monday to ``continue our struggle for democracyby various means until the goal is achieved.''   The statement was issued by former Brig. Gen. Aung Gyi, formerDefense Minister Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Burma'slate independence leader. They had been demanding that Maung Maungallow an interim government to conduct multiparty elections.   Some diplomats suggested Saw Maung seized power to save theBurma Socialist Program Party, the target of months of massivestreet protests. Protesters blame the country's sole legal partyfor 26 years of repression and isolationist police that has ruinedthe economy.   Burma has been in turmoil since students rioted 12 months agoagainst government economic policies. Security forces killed scoresof protesters in March and June, and riots since July have forcedthe resignations of longtime strongman Ne Win and his successor,Sein Lwin. At least 112 people died in the rioting against SeinLwin.   Protests continued after Maung Maung took over and widespreadstrikes, demonstrations, looting and lawlessness have paralyzed theeconomy and pushed the nation towards anarchy.</TEXT></DOC>
