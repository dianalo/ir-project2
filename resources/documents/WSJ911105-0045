The bid by the National Association of Life and HealthGuaranty Associations also was sweetened to include $300million in cash to recapitalize the company, replacingsecurities proposed earlier.</LP><TEXT>   The new commitments are intended to meet stringentconditions set by California Insurance Commissioner JohnGaramendi, who has provisionally selected the association asthe winning bidder for Executive Life.   Industry officials, who announced the new backing raisedin an unparalleled industry campaign, said that, with othersteps, it answered Mr. Garamendi's call for more certainty inthe guaranty association's proposal. A spokesman for Mr.Garamendi declined to comment.   But in a number of ways, the prospects for theassociation's proposal for Executive Life and theextraordinary industry move to back that proposal remainuncertain. Mr. Garamendi is scheduled to announce tomorrowwhether the new commitments are sufficient. Should he rejectthe association's latest plan, the court-supervised auctionwould focus on two former front-runners, a French investorgroup lead by Altus Finance, a subsidiary of the French bankCredit Lyonnais, and a group lead by San Francisco investmentbankers Hellman andamp; Friedman.   The 20 companies backing the new proposed $1 billionfacility include Prudential Insurance Co. of America,Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., the Equitable Life AssuranceSociety of the U.S., as well as Pacific Mutual Life InsuranceCo. and Transamerica Occidental Life, two large West Coastinsurers that spearheaded the industry effort.   As part of the plan to assure sufficient funds to back thejunk bond-laden assets of Executive Life, the guarantyassociation said its member guaranty funds would set aside15% of their assessment capacity over the next six years tomeet demands for further capital from the reconstructedExecutive Life, which would be called Galico. State guarantyfunds are financed by industry contributions, which areassessed as needed to make good the guaranteed liabilities offailed insurers.   The new $1 billion facility is intended to make up anyshortfall if the state funds fail to produce needed capitalwhen asked. California regulators have worried that futureinsurer insolvencies or other problems may limit the moneythat individual state funds may be able to supply.   Morgan Guaranty Trust, a unit of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. that isacting as agent for the insurers, would be a conduit forfunds and also provide as much as $100 million of thefacility. The so-called line of credit is written so thatinsurers stand &quot;irrevocably&quot; bound to make good on claims.Pledges to the facility equal about 3% of most of theinsurers' combined capital, surplus and bond reserves.   The association's plan would initially creditpolicyholders with about 89 cents on the dollar. It wouldretain Executive Life's big portfolio of high-risk,high-yield junk bond portfolio, hoping to gain from anyimprovement over time in the value of the bonds. Moreover, itcould reduce the cost of the industry by cutting companycontributions to guaranty funds.   But, despite the size of the industry's backing for theassociation's bid, this intricate package still leavesquestions about the amount of funds committed and the fashionin which they are assembled.   So rushed were the association's backers yesterday thatthey were able to offer only a brief summary outline of theirplan to California officials early in the day, although afull version was later filed.   By offering to buy Executive Life, state guaranty fundsare for the first time ever both seeking to recapitalize acompany and also of having to make good on its uncovered,guaranteed promises to policyholders. There is some doubtwhether the roughly $1 billion pledged in various forms inthe association's bid is enough to do that.   Rival bidders, who have promised to inject either $1billion, in the case of the Hellman andamp; Friedman group, or $3billion, in the case of the Altus Finance French group, havealso counted on roughly $1 billion that the guaranty fundswould owe in any case for covered policy claims.   And, in another vein, negotiators for Mr. Garamendiapparently told Nolhga's representatives privately that theywere looking for a direct commitment from the industry inmany ways exactly the reverse of what the association haspresented. State negotiators are believed to have asked thatindividual insurers directly reinsure Executive Life'sobligations, or fund with cash an escrow account from whichfunds could be drawn.   Yesterday's commitment calls for insurance companies toprovide capital for Executive Life if state guaranty fundscan't at some time maintain sufficient financial footing forthe junk bond-laden company. In effect, it is a subordinateguarantee that may or may not pass muster with Mr. Garamendiand his advisers.</TEXT></DOC>
