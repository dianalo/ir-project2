ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former President Reagan ``participatedpersonally and directly'' in giving favored treatment to countriesthat supported the Contras in Nicaragua, lawyers for Oliver Northsaid in a court filing aimed at having charges against their clientdropped.   North attorney Brendan Sullivan, opposing a compromise betweenthe independent counsel and the Justice Department, said in courtpapers released Monday that the proposed deal on keeping certainsecrets out of the trial would prevent him from introducing thisevidence which he said was central to North's defense.   He also criticized Attorney General Dick Thornburgh for declining``to take the political heat'' and make a separatesecrets-protecting move that could lead to charges being thrown out.   Sullivan said, ``At the heart of this case are the quid pro quoand other third-country arrangements with which the Reaganadministration obtained military support for the resistance duringthe so-called Boland Amendments, and the policy that thosethird-country arrangements would not be disclosed outside a limitedgroup of executive branch officials.''   The Boland amendments, passed by Congress, restricted and attimes prohibited the spending of federal funds in support of theguerrilla war against the leftist government in Nicaragua.   Former National Security Adviser John Poindexter testified at thecongressional Iran-Contra hearings in 1987 that Reagan favoredmaking up for that lack of official U.S. support with money fromother nations. But the assertion that Reagan was personally involvedin arranging to return the favors is new.   Theodore Olson, an attorney for Reagan, declined comment onSullivan's filing after its contents were described to him.   Sullivan's statements were in a written response to U.S. DistrictJudge Gerhard A. Gesell, objecting to a new plan for protectingnational security secrets at North's trial.   The plan, worked out by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh andthe Justice Department, ``would gut the defense and guarantee a`cuckoo-clock' trial,'' Sullivan said. It would hide ``criticalinformation about the Reagan administration's third-countryarrangements for military support of the resistance and the officialnondisclosure of those arrangements.''   Sullivan said that the way the government proposed to presentthis information to the jury _ through a general ``admission'' withno details allowed _ would leave out ``that President Reagan and topexecutive branch officials participated personally and directly inthose arrangements.''   He said under the government proposal, the jury would never hearabout ``direct personal participation in the third-countryarrangements'' by Reagan and these officials of his administration:National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, Poindexter'spredecessor; Secretary of State George Shultz; Secretary of DefenseCaspar Weinberger; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs John Vessey, and thelate CIA Director William Casey.   Most of the details of the proposed court agreement were keptsecret, but their intent was to establish nine specific categoriesof information that cannot be revealed by North in his defense.   Sullivan urged that Gesell reject the proposed rules out of hand.   The proposed agreement between Thornburgh and Walsh is acompromise to deal with Justice Department objections that rulesunder which the trial was to be conducted would allow North todisclose important national security information.   Gesell is to conduct a hearing on the agreement Tuesday.   The beginning of the trial was put on hold Sunday when ChiefJustice William Rehnquist of the Supreme Court granted the JusticeDepartment's request for a stay. However, the department has said itwill ask Rehnquist to lift the stay if Gesell approves the agreementon testimony involving classified information.   Sullivan said in his court filing, ``If imposed by the court, thestipulation could cripple the defense of this case. ... We cannotadequately defend this case without this information.''   He also attacked Thornburgh for not using an avenue open to himfor stopping classified information from coming out _ filing anaffidavit under the Classified Information Procedures Act. Such anaffidavit would force the judge to bar the information and couldresult in dismissal of some or all of the 12 criminal chargesagainst North.   ``The attorney general apparently does not want to take thepolitical heat associated with filing an affidavit that could resultin sanctions afffecting the triability of the case, even though hehas a clear duty to protect the national security,'' Sullivan said.   ``It is understandable that if the case is untriable, theattorney general would rather blame someone other than theadministration.''   Last month, two major counts against North were dismissed afterThornburgh refused on national security grounds to allow the use ofclassified material deemed essential in the case.   Reacting to Sullivan's comments, David Runkel, a Thornburgh aide,said the attorney general ``has been in public life more than 20years. He's never been unwilling to take political heat if the causeis just.''   Sullivan said in his new filing that the proposedWalsh-Thornburgh agreement ``would guarantee a `cuckoo-clock' trialthat would make a mockery of the adversarial process.''   Gesell has promised he won't hold a ``cuckoo-clock'' trial _meaning he doesn't want constant interruptions at the trial forchallenges on whether a document can be disclosed.   With the issue of national security disclosures still unsettledMonday morning, Gesell sent the jurors home, telling them to checkby telephone for their next court date.   The nine proposed categories of secret material that can't beused include information that would identify undercover CIAofficers, the locations of CIA stations, identities of foreignindividuals who work for the spy agency and details about CIAoperations with foreign intelligence services.   Also included would be material about American intelligencecollection on terrorism and eforts to locate hostages, U.S. covertactivities other than military support for the Contras, and names ofnon-Central American countries that supported the Contras.   Instances of quid pro quo efforts involving North surfaced in theIran-Contra congressional hearings.   For example, on March 5, 1985, he proposed that Guatemala berewarded for its assistance in providing false end-user certificatesso that more than 98,000 pounds of East European munitions could bedelivered by chartered aircraft from a European arms dealer to aCentral American country for the Contras.   In a memo to McFarlane, then the national security adviser, Northsuggested that the secretaries of state and defense and Vessey ofthe joint chiefs be asked to grant Guatemala additional securityassistance.   The purpose of the memo, said North, was to ``find a way by whichwe can compensate'' Guatemala ``for the extraordinary assistancethey are providing to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters.'' North saidhe was attaching ``end-user certificates'' which Guatemala``provided for the purchase of nearly $8M worth of munitions to bedelivered'' to the Contras.   There was no indication what became of North's request.</TEXT></DOC>
