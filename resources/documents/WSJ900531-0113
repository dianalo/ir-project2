Their mission: to coax roughly $1 billion from Japan forthe superconducting supercollider to be built in Texas.</LP><TEXT>   Their pitch is becoming more common. Big basic-scienceprojects are getting more expensive. The U.S. government isfinancially pinched. And there is growing sentiment thatJapan should share more of its wealth -- particularly becauseit has benefited greatly from relatively free access toWestern basic research.   In February U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney pressedJapan to share more of its military technology, noting that&quot;Japan and other allies have long benefited from technologyflow from the United States.&quot; Japan is also likely to getrequests as Americans raise funds for other megaprojects suchas an advanced fusion reactor and a manned journey to Mars.   But such pleas, at least in the short term, will likely gounfulfilled, further fraying bilateral relations. Japaneseofficials say they agree in general with foreign demands, butJapanese science policy-making works against major spendingon basic research.   That stance already is creating problems. Last year,prominent American biologists, led by Nobel laureate James D.Watson, lambasted Japan on Capitol Hill for foot-dragging insupporting a multibillion-dollar effort to map the humangenetic system. &quot;The days when the United States caneffectively subsidize Japanese science are over,&quot; Mr. Watsonwrote to a Japanese colleague.   The supercollider, scheduled for completion by 1998, issupposed to push particle physics to unprecedented energylevels, giving new insights into the basic laws of matter.The U.S. government is planning to underwrite $5 billion ofthe $8 billion price tag, with the state of Texas chipping inanother billion dollars. American officials are now tappingother sources to meet the total. Japan is their first stop.   U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore, the leaderof this week's delegation, said at a press luncheon hereyesterday that the government is approaching Japan because ofits advanced work in physics. He refused to say publicly howmuch support he seeks from the Japanese, but several membersof the delegation put the figure at $1 billion. Mr. Moorestressed that Japan is being approached as a potentialpartner -- participating in designing and constructing theproject -- not just as a financier. He said he will alsodiscuss the issue with other countries, starting with SouthKorea next week.   Other officials say the U.S. expects Japan in particularto play a greater role. In bilateral discussions inWashington at the beginning of May, &quot;there was a generalagreement that greater cooperation was needed in basicscience in general and in the megaprojects in particular,&quot; J.Thomas Ratchford, associate director of the White HouseOffice of Science and Technology Policy, said publicly.   By its own admission, Japan is a relative laggard infundamental scientific research. Research-and-developmentspending by the government, the main source of basic researchfunds, is less than 0.5% of Japan's gross national product,compared with more than 1% in the U.S., West Germany, andFrance.   Two weeks ago, the Ministry of International Trade andIndustry issued a report calling for Japan to increasegovernment funding to 1% of GNP by the year 2000. &quot;Until now,we haven't placed emphasis on basic, or creative Randamp;D work,&quot;said Yukio Honda, director of the technology policy planningdivision at MITI's Agency of Industrial Science andTechnology.   Japan is already contributing somewhat more tointernational projects. It is helping build, along withEurope, a part of the U.S.-sponsored space station. &quot;Thetrend is toward convergence&quot; in basic research spending byJapan and the U.S., Mr. Ratchford noted. But it will be adifficult battle before Japan reaches parity. The Ministry ofFinance opposes any increase in the national budget. AndJapan's policymaking, particularly in science, is dividedamong several bureaucracies that rarely agree.   &quot;Everybody feels we have to contribute something on theseinternational matters,&quot; says Genya Chiba, vice president ofthe government-sponsored Research andamp; Development Corp. ofJapan and a major proponent of more basic research. &quot;But Idon't know how. Which ministry, which department isresponsible for that? A consensus hasn't been formed.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
