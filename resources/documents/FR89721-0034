Eighteen populationsare recorded from West Virginia south to Georgia. Although the speciesis widespread geographically, it is restricted to a narrow ecological nicheand occurs in limited to moderate populations at most locations. Occurringalong scoured banks of high gradient streams or braided features of lowerreaches, <T3>Spiraea virginiana</T3> is presently known from 17 stream systems in5 states. Approximately eight historic records are known in addition toone unverified record. A combination of factors contributes to the rarityof the species, including a very narrowly defined habitat niche that issubject to scouring and flooding, an apparent lack of successful sexualreproduction, limited opportunities for colonization, and competition fromother species. Threats to the species include human disturbance at specificsite locations and two proposed hydroelectric facilities. Unsuccessfulseed germination tests and the lack of seedlings at any location suggestthat only one genotype is present at each location. Critical habitat isnot proposed at this time. The Service seeks data and comments from thepublic on this proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments from all interested parties must be received bySeptember 19, 1989.

Millspaugh on June 20, 1890, along the Monongahela River in MonongaliaCounty, West Virginia (Clarkson 1959, Glencoe 1961). The original descriptionalso noted an 1878 collection from the mountains of North Carolina madeby G.R. Vasey (Britton 1890).Later studies of the Virginia spiraea described variations in leaf size,shape and degree of serration, resulting in the publication of variety<T3>serrulata </T3>(Rehder 1920), which was later reduced to form <T3>serrulata </T3>(Rehder 1949). Clarkson (1959) referred some specimensto <T3>S. corymbosa </T3>Raf. (=<T3>S. betulifolia </T3>Pallas) although Glencoe (1961) included thesespecimens in his concept of <T3>S. virginiana,</T3> noting that the species was extremely variable.After visiting many populations throughout the range of the species, Oglehas concluded that <T3>S. virginiana </T3>is a distinct species and is easily distinguishedfrom <T3>S. corymbosa </T3>on the basis of plant height, branching patterns,inflorescence size, and leaf morphology (D. Ogle, Virginia Highlands CommunityCollege, pers. comm. 1988.). More important differences are the distincthabitat preferences of the two species and the non-overlapping geographic(allopatric) ranges (Ogle, pers. comm. 1988).Virginia spiraea is a shrub in the rose family that grows from two to tenfeet tall, with arching and upright stems. The species is a prolific sprouterand forms dense clumps that spread in rock crevices and around boulders.Leaves are alternate and quite variable in size, shape and degree of serration.Cream-colored flowers occur in branched, flat-topped inflorescences approximatelyfour to eight inches wide. Plants flower during June and July.<T3>S. virginiana</T3> is found in a narrowly defined habitat. It occursalong scoured banks of high gradient streams, or on meander scrolls, pointbars, natural levees, or braided features of lower reaches. Scour mustbe sufficient to prevent canopy closure, but not extreme enough to completelyremove small, woody species. Plants are most vigorous in full sun, butcan tolerate some shading until released from competition (primarily fromtrees, large shrubs or vines). They occur within the maximum floodplain,usually at the water's edge with a variety of other disturbance-prone species(Ogle, pers. comm. 1988).Presently, <T3>S. virginiana</T3> is known from 18 locations on 17 stream systemsin 5 states. One unconfirmed record has been reported from the GreenbrierRiver in West Virginia and approximately 8 historic records are known.In Georgia, populations occur on Rock Creek in Walker County and Bear Creekin Dade County. The North Carolina sites are found on the South Fork ofthe New River in Ashe County, the Little Tennessee River in Macon County,the Nolichucky River in Mitchell and Yancey Counties (extending downstreaminto Unicoi County, Tennessee), the South Toe River in Yancey County, andthe Cane River in Yancey County. The species is known from additional sitesin Tennessee along Abrams Creek in Blount County, Cane Creek in Van BurenCounty, White Oak Creek in Scott County, and Clifty Creek in Roane County.The Virginia populations are found on the Russell Fork and Pound Riversin Dickenson County, the New River in Grayson County, and the Guest Riverin Wise County. West Virginia records occur on the Bluestone River in MercerCounty, in a shrub-dominated wet meadow in Raleigh County, and along theGauley and Meadow Rivers in Nicholas and Fayette Counties.Historic collections are known from North Carolina (Graham and BuncombeCounties), Tennessee (Blount and Morgan Counties), West Virginia (Fayette,Monongalia and Upshur Counties) and Pennsylvania (Fayette County).Since the species is found sporadically scattered along streams and rivers,it is difficult to delineate the exact boundaries of discrete populations.All of the populations listed above occur within a five to six mile sectionof river; however, most populations are not scattered and only occur alonga half mile or less of streambank.Population estimates are based on the number of clumps recorded duringfield visits. Of the 18 known sites, 8 are limited populations (less than10 clumps), 8 are moderate in size (from 10 to 50 clumps) and only 2 areabundant (greater than 50 clumps).Populations occur in a variety of Federal and State ownerships. Many arealso found on private property, and since populations occur along rivers,several sites involve more than one landowner. Federal ownership includesthe Jefferson National Forest (Virginia), the Cherokee National Forest(Tennessee), Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Tennessee), Big SouthFork National River and Recreation Area (Tennessee_Corps of Engineers andNational Park Service) and John Flannagan Dam (Virginia_Corps of Engineers).Populations are found in four State parks in Georgia, Tennessee, Virginiaand West Virginia. Presently, three sites are voluntarily protected byprivate landowners contacted by The Nature Conservancy or State heritageprograms. Throughout the range of the species, historically known siteshave been eliminated by dam or navigational facility construction (siteson the Monongahela and Buckhannon Rivers in West Virginia). Other historicallyknown populations have not been relocated and are assumed extirpated (fivesites in North Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia and Pennsylvania).The Virginia spiraea is a rare species due to a combination of factors,and biological circumstances as well as documented and potential humandisturbance threaten many populations. The species occurs in a constantlyfluctuating environment and requires disturbance for successful colonization,establishment and maintenance; however, too much scouring and/or floodingcould eliminate populations entirely (Ogle, pers. comm. 1988). Field observationshave documented a lack of or a significant reduction in seed production(many populations show aborted seeds), and germination tests have producedlow germination rates. These observations suggest that only one genotypemay be present at each location. Opportunities for colonization of newsites are probably very limited and dependent upon a unique combinationof biological and environmental conditions (Ogle, pers. comm. 1988). Competitionby both native and introduced species adversely affects populations. Additionally,many populations are threatened by a range of human activities. A proposedhydroelectric facility at Summersville Dam on the Gauley River in WestVirginia is located immediately upstream from one of the largest knownpopulations, and long range plans include a hydroelectric generating facilityat John Flannagan Dam on the Pound River in Virginia, above another population.In 1986, the Service contracted with The Nature Conservancy's Eastern RegionalOffice to conduct status survey work on <T3>Spiraea virginiana </T3>and other Federal candidate plant species.Historic sites were searched in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia.Suitable habitat was searched in Maryland (E. Thompson, Maryland NaturalHeritage Program, pers. comm. 1988), West Virginia (Bartgis 1987) and Virginia(Ogle 1987). After completing fieldwork in Virginia, Ogle relocated historicsites in Georgia, Tennessee and North Carolina, searched approximately75 to 100 miles of riverbank resulting in the discovery of about 20 newclones, and recorded detailed information at 14 of the 18 known sites (Ogle,pers. comm. 1988). Most field workers reported that much suitable habitatexists; however, they indicated that the potential for finding new locationsis low due to the rough and remote terrain that needs to be searched, andthe sporadic occurrence of the species. It is anticipated that some additionalpopulations will be found, but apparent lack of sexual reproduction, smallsizes of known populations, and a variety of threats suggest that few additionalsites will be located.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) recognized <T3>Spiraea virginiana</T3> as a Category 2 candidate for listing in theSupplement to Review of Plant Taxa for Listing as Endangered or ThreatenedSpecies published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 28, 1983 (48 FR 53641). Category2 comprises those taxa for which listing is possibly appropriate but forwhich existing information is insufficient to support a proposed rule.The updated notice of review for plant taxa published on September 27,1988, again included <T3>Spiraea virginiana</T3> in Category 2.After evaluating the results of recent status survey work, the Servicedetermined that listing <T3>Spiraea virginiana</T3> as a threatened species was appropriate. Thisdecision was supported by The Nature Conservancy, Heritage Program personneland other botanists (Bartgis 1987; Ogle, pers. comm. 1988; T. Rawinski,The Nature Conservancy, pers. comm. 1988; A. Weakley, North Carolina HeritageProgram, pers. comm. 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations codified at (50 CFR part 424) promulgatedto implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the proceduresfor adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined tobe an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factorsdescribed in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Spiraea virginiana </T3>Britt. (Virginia spiraea) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range.</T3> Human disturbance at Virginia spiraea locationshas been observed throughout the range of the species. Obvious signs ofdisturbance include debris sliding down a railroad embankment, mowing andclearing at the edge of a farm field, cutting for right-of-way maintenance,cutting for an access path to the river, habitat disturbance by rafters,a culvert draining directly onto plants and debris settling on plants fromcutting of trees up slope. Recreational use of rivers is rising, and disturbanceto <T3>S. virginiana</T3> populations is expected to continue or increase.However, appropriate disturbance (to eliminate competition from other species)is necessary to maintain open habitat for <T3>S. virginiana</T3> populations.Populations in West Virginia have been eliminated through constructionof a dam (Monongalia County) and construction of a railroad adjacent tothe river (Upshur County) (Bartgis 1987). Populations have not been relocatedand are believed to be extirpated from the only known site in Pennsylvania,two sites in North Carolina, and one location each in Tennessee and WestVirginia.Suitable habitat has been eliminated throughout the range of the speciesby reservoir construction. Even if populations are not directly flooded,they may face the potential indirect threats of upstream and downstreamwater stabilization, which would eliminate or reduce scouring action necessaryto maintain open habitat for the species.Natural threats to the species include large scouring floods and competitionfrom other woody species. Although <T3>S. virginiana</T3> is adapted to a fluctuating riverine environment,large storm events (100-year or larger floods) would probably eliminatemost populations. Competition from native species such as <T3>Physocarpus opulenta, Cornus ammomum, Alnus serrulata, Platanus occidentalis,Rhus radicans, Salix </T3>sp., <T3>Ilex</T3> sp., and <T3>Vitis</T3> sp. has been observed at most locations in varying degrees,in addition to competition from introduced species like <T3>Pueraria lobata, Polygonum cuspidatum, Lonicera japonica, Miscanthussinensis, Arthraxon hispidus, Phalaris arundinacea</T3> and <T3>Rosa multiflora</T3> (Ogle, pers. comm. 1988).B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific or educationalpurposes. Spiraea virginiana</T3> is not currently a significant componentof the commercial trade in native plants; however, the species has goodpotential for horticultural use, and publicity surrounding the listingof the species could generate an increased demand.C. <T3>Disease or predation.</T3> Aphid damage on short tips has been observedat several populations in addition to leaf removal and laceration by caterpillars(Ogle, pers. comm. 1988). It is not known if this predation affects thecompetitive ability of <T3>Spiraea virginiana.</T3>D. <T3>Inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.</T3> Currently, personnelin Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia are working to add <T3>S. virginiana</T3> to their official State lists. The species is listedas extirpated in Pennsylvania and endangered in Tennessee. West Virginiadoes not maintain an official list of rare plants.The Georgia Wildflower Preservation Act of 1973 prohibits digging, removal,or sale of State-listed plants from public lands without the approval ofthe Georgia Department of Natural Resources. One population in Georgiais on State park land and will be provided stronger protection once officialState-listing occurs. However, the second population is on private landand is only protected voluntarily through an informal agreement (Patrick,Georgia Natural Heritage Inventory, pers. comm. 1988).The unofficial status of <T3>S. virginiana</T3> in North Carolina is presently ``primary proposed.''Some legal protection will be given the species once listing occurs. NorthCarolina General Statute 19-B, 202.12-202.19, provides State-listed plantsprotection from intrastate trade without a permit, and provides for monitoringand management of listed populations. Most populations in North Carolinaoccur on private land.<T3>Spiraea virginiana</T3> is not currently State-listed in Virginia,although the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is presentlyworking to add it to the list. The Endangered Plant and Insect SpeciesAct provides protection from taking without permits; however, private landownersare exempt from this provision. The Act also gives the Department authorityto regulate the sale and movement of listed plants, and to establish programsfor the management of listed plants.<T3>S. virginiana</T3> is listed as an endangered species on Tennessee'slist of endangered, threatened, and rare plant species. The Tennessee RarePlant Protection and Conservation Act prohibits taking without permissionof the landowner and requires that any commercial activity in the speciesbe authorized by permit. Populations in Tennessee occur on Federal, Stateand private lands and have some protection under current State regulations.Pennsylvania presently lists the species as extirpated under the regulationsof the Wild Resources Conservation Act (25 Pa. Code, Chapter 82). Wildplant management permits are required by anyone who wishes to collect,remove, or transplant wild plants classified as endangered or threatened.Landowners are exempt from these requirements. Pennsylvania regulationsalso provide for the establishment of native wild plant sanctuaries onprivate lands where there is a management agreement between the landownerand the Department of Environmental Resources. It is anticipated that if<T3>S. virginiana</T3> were rediscovered in Pennsylvania, a change in theofficial State status would afford some protection for the species.Existing regulatory mechanisms do not provide protection from human disturbance,habitat loss or biological limitations, which are presently the major threatsto the species.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>Biological factors apparently threaten the continued existence of <T3>S. virginiana. </T3>Although the species flowers profusely and is visitedby a variety of common insects, mature seeds have been observed at onlya few populations (Ogle, pers. comm. 1988). While plants spread clonally,most plants observed are generally very old with well-established rootsystems. Field biologists have not reported the presence of seedings atany population. Ogle attempted to germinate seeds collected from two NorthCarolina populations and reported successful germination from seeds collectedat only one site. Nicholson collected seeds from a Virginia populationbut only five seeds germinated out of hundreds (perhaps thousands) of seedscollected, an unusual occurrence for <T3>Spiraea </T3>species (R. Nicholson, Arnold Arboretum Greenhouse, pers.comm. 1988). Germination tests indicate that a mineral soil may be requiredfor successful germination; then, successful growth and establishment ofyoung plants may require humus to be added through seasonal depositionwithout flooding or swiftly flowing waters (e.g. slowly receding afterhigh flows) (Ogle, pers. comm. 1988).It is expected that new populations could originate from clumps breakingoff and becoming established downstream during flood events. However, severefloods could potentially eliminate original populations and the dispersedclumps would have to lodge in a location where conditions favorable toestablishment and survival existed (open canopy, lack of competition, availablemoisture without flooding or fast flows, and sufficient soil for plantsto take root).While few details of the life history are known, observations made duringfield visits suggest that each population may represent only one genotype(for a total of 18 different genotypes), and that opportunities for colonizationand establishment of new sites are very limited (Ogle, pers. comm. 1988).Most populations appear to be very old and face a variety of threats throughoutthe range of the species. Heavy competition from other species occurs atmost populations.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thespecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Spiraea virginiana </T3>as a threatened species. Although known from18 sites in 5 states, human disturbance, a constantly fluctuating environment,and competition from other species pose problems to the continued existenceof many populations. Additionally, biological factors apparently limitopportunities for establishment and colonization of new sites. Field observationssuggest that only 18 different genotypes exist, and 89 percent of the knownpopulations are limited to moderate in size. However, populations are reproducingcolonally, and it is possible that few additional populations will be discovered.These factors support listing as a threatened species. Critical habitatis not being designated for reasons discussed in the following section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)3 of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for <T3>Spiraea virginiana </T3>at this time. Most populations of this speciesare limited to moderate in size and loss of plants to vandalism, or increasedcollection for scientific or horticultural use could potentially eliminatesmaller populations. Collecting, without permits, will be prohibited atthe locations under Federal management; however, taking restrictions willbe dificult to enforce at these sites and will not be applicable to siteson private land. Therefore, publication of critical habitat descriptionsand maps would increase the vulnerability of the species without significantlyincreasing protection. The owners of all populations on Federal and Statelands have been informed of the importance of protecting the species andits habitat. Landowners of major populations on private land have alsobeen contacted by the Service, and State heritage program personnel havecontacted two other landowners. Protection of this species' habitat willbe addressed throughout the recovery process and through the section 7jeopardy standard. No additional benefits would result from a determinationof critical habitat. For these reasons, it would not be prudent to determinecritical habitat for <T3>Spiraea virginiana </T3>at this time.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatendedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State and private agencies, groups and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies.The Nature Conservancy and State natural resource agencies have alreadysecured voluntary protection of three sites. As a result of the Servicefunded status survey work and the subsequent recommendation list the species,three States are working to add <T3>Spiraea virginiana </T3>to their official State lists.Five populations occur totally or partially on Federal lands (U.S. ForestService, National Park Service and Army Corps of Engineers). An additionalfour sites occur partially or completely on State park lands in Georgia,Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. The appropriate managing agencieshave been contacted, and it is anticipated that they will implement appropriatemanagement plans.Listing should encourage research on critical aspects of population biology.Information is needed regarding the number of different genotypes, thelack of successful seed production, and disturbance regimes required forpopulation establishment and maintenance. These factors will be importantin long-term management considerations for individual populations.Other conservation measures, including required protection efforts by Federalagencies and prohibition against taking are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service. Two populations occurdownstream of dams at Army Corps of Engineers Reservoirs (John FlannaganDam, Dickenson County, Virginia and Summersville Lake, Nicholas County,West Virginia). A hydroeletric project that requires a license from theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is currently proposed for SummersvilleDam and long range plans include a similar project at John Flannagan Dam.Three populations in West Virginia occur in areas recently designated aNational Recreation Area or a National Scenic River. These three populationsoccur on the Gauley, Meadow and Bluestone Rivers. Although These populationspresently occur on private land, it is anticipated that the National ParkService will eventually acquire these lands. All of these projects willrequire consultation with the Servcie.Other Federally funded or permitted actions that could affect this plantinclude, but are not limited to, Soil Conservation Service watershed managementactivities, FERC-permitted hydroelectric projects, road construction projectsinvolving Federal Highway Administration funds, railroad abandonment proposalsunder the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, or projectsunder the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.71 and 17.72set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptions that applyto all threatened plants. With respect to <T3>Spiraea virginiana, </T3>all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2)of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.71, would apply. These prohibitions,in part, would make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdictionof the United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreigncommerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for salethis species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduceto possession the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Seedsfrom cultivated specimens of threatened plant species are exempt from theseprohibitions provided that a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appearson their containers. Certain exceptions can apply to agents of the Serviceand State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.72 also providefor the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activitiesinvolving threatened species under certain circumstances. It is anticipatedthat few trade permits would ever be sought or issued since the speciesis not common in cultivation or the wild. Requests for copies of the regulationson plants and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the Office ofManagement Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240(703/235-1903).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) of <T3>Spiraea virginiana</T3>;(2) The location of any additional population of <T3>Spiraea virginiana</T3> and the reasons why any habitat should or shouldnot be determined to be critical habitat as provided by Section 4 of theAct;(3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on <T3>Spiraea virginiana.</T3>Final promulgation of the regulations on <T3>Spiraea virginiana</T3> will take into consideration the comments andany additional information received by the Service, and such communicationsmay lead to adoption of a final regulation that differs from this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the Supervisor,Ecological Services Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Bartgis, R. 1987.
