SeibStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan promised that the Securities and Exchange Commission will press ahead with its campaign against insider trading under his nominee for SEC chairman, David S. Ruder.    The president said in a statement that the expertise of Mr. Ruder, a Northwestern University law professor and securities-law scholar, &quot;ensures that the commission will have the guidance of a steady hand.&quot; The statement, issued yesterday after White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced the appointment, signaled that there won't be any major policy changes when Mr. Ruder takes over from John Shad, the new ambassador to the Netherlands.    While Mr. Ruder's nomination was well received by the SEC staff and the legal community, Senate Democrats expressed doubts about his commitment to law enforcement. &quot;The SEC needs a tough cop at this point in its history,&quot; asserted Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee's securities panel.    In an interview yesterday, Mr. Ruder, the former dean of Northwestern University Law School, declined to spell out his position on corporate takeover regulation, shareholder voting rights and other issues pending before the SEC and Congress. But he said: &quot;I believe the commission's vigororous enforcement program against insider trading must continue.&quot;    Mr. Ruder's appointment caps a career as an academic, American Bar Association leader and practicing lawyer. &quot;I've always been interested in becoming an SEC commissioner, and as I grew older, more interested in becoming chairman,&quot; the 58-year-old Mr. Ruder said.    Colleagues of Mr. Ruder said that he defies being pigeon-holed. &quot;He comes to the SEC with no axes to grind,&quot; said Stephen Presser, a Northwestern law professor. &quot;He really does believe in the law and in the evolution of the law.&quot;    Mr. Presser said he expects Mr. Ruder to &quot;take a very cautious approach&quot; on takeover issues so as to maintain a balance between raiders and takeover targets. &quot;He will feel very much constrained to interpret the Williams Act (the takeover law) in the way that Congress intended,&quot; Mr. Presser said.    SEC officials said they believe that Mr. Ruder would be comfortable with the free-market inclination of the other commissioners to let the marketplace and the courts correct most takeover abuses.    Mr. Ruder is the son of a Wausau, Wis., lawyer and a grandson of a smalltown brewer. He graduated from Williams College in 1951 and from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1957. He practiced law in Milwaukee before joining Northwestern's law faculty in 1961, and worked part-time for the Chicago firm of Schiff, Hardin andamp; Waite from 1971 to 1976. As a scholar, Mr. Ruder has specialized in the area of securities fraud.    Alan Bromberg, a Southern Methodist University law professor, said it will be an &quot;interesting test whether he will be as strong on insider trading as he is on traditional areas like false financial statements and (stock) manipulations.&quot;    Mr. Ruder's nomination is a departure from the practice of recruiting top Wall Street lawyers to head the SEC. If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he would join William O. Douglas and William Carey as one of the few chairmen plucked out of law schools.    Though Mr. Ruder doesn't have extensive practical experience, some in the securities industry think his academic background will serve him well at a time when Congress is likely to revise the takeover and insider-trading laws.    &quot;We're at a point where many of the basic securities laws are being or are about to be reexamined,&quot; said Edward O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association. &quot;And I think a person with an academic orientation can bring to bear some original thinking on these statutes.&quot;    Donald Feuerstein, a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc., predicted that Wall Street will embrace Mr. Ruder as &quot;a very fine appointment.&quot;    Leo Herzel, a partner in the Chicago firm of Mayer, Brown and Platt, doesn't expect Mr. Ruder to be a controversial appointee. &quot;He is going to be a middle-of-the-road chairman -- not a far-out regulator or a far-out free-market type,&quot; said Mr. Herzel. &quot;He doesn't want to see the Williams Act go. And I don't think he wants to oppress big business. He will be very practical.&quot;    Mr. Herzel cited Mr. Ruder's political and administrative skills, as did his associates at Northwestern, where he had a leading role in a $27 million fund-raising campaign for the law school. &quot;He is used to dealing with a lot of intellectually aggressive people,&quot; Mr. Herzel said. &quot;He should fit right in (at the SEC). I doubt he is going to arouse any antagonism.&quot;    The departure of Mr. Shad, who has served as SEC chairman for a record six years, isn't expected to trigger any staff shakeup or an exodus of personnel. &quot;I think everybody is delighted with the (Ruder) appointment,&quot; said Kathyrn McGrath, director of investment management. &quot;He's a good man; he know his stuff.&quot;    Commissioner Edward Fleischman, who had been a finalist for the chairmanship, said he expects Mr. Ruder to be a &quot;strong chairman.&quot; And despite his scholarly reputation, Mr. Fleischman added, &quot;I've never thought of him as an ivory-tower academic.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
