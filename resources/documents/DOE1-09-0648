To investigate precisely the effect of the operatingparameters and the design of the equipments, an experimental unit ofthe granulator was developed, in which small granules could be preparedcontinuously at the steady state operating conditions. Particularly,the most appropriate control parameters in view of both the size controland the stable operation were discussed and confirmed experimentally.</TEXT></DOC>
