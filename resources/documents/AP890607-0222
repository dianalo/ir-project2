A combination of economic and political factors were responsiblefor Goodyear's decision to divest its Uitenhage, South Africa, tireand general products manufacturing operation.   The business will be sold to Consol Limited, an industrialsubsidiary of Anglovaal Ltd., a South African financial, industrialand mining group.   Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear's chairman, president and chiefexecutive officer, said the company regrets leaving South Africaafter providing jobs there for more than four decades.   But, in an announcement of the sale, he stated: ``It is becomingincreasingly difficult for American companies to obtain adequatereturns on investments there.''   Barrett said the reasons for Goodyear's disinvestment includedU.S. sanctions against South Africa, double U.S. taxation of SouthAfrican earnings and the likelihood of a continuing decline in thevalue of the South African rand against major currencies.   The U.S. Congress in late 1987 enacted legislation thateliminates a tax credit for U.S. companies that allowed them todeduct taxes paid to South Africa against taxes owed to the U.S.government.   The former Reagan administration opposed the amendment andconsidered fighting to have it repealed, but it remains the law.   Former U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said atthe time the bill was passed that ``the most likely effect will beto accelerate the takeover of U.S. assets by South African firms atbargain prices.''   Barrett said Anglovaal Ltd. was a reponsible group that haddemonstrated concern for human rights in the workplace and hadexpressed intentions to retain the current workforce of 2,400people, the majority of whom are black and colored.   Mike McNamara, chairman and managing director of Goodyear's SouthAfrican business, said the company would continue to operate underthe same management.   ``We have always taken great pride in our people and ourmanagement team and employees have vast knowledge of the local tireand rubber industry,'' said McNamara. ``For them, we will continueto operate under present employment policies, practices and benefitsand all existing agreements and arrangements with our two tradeunions remain unaltered.''   Goodyear began manufacturing tires in South Africa in 1947, theyear before the South African government adopted the apartheidpolicy of racial separation.   Over the years, Goodyear took the position that it couldcontribute to social progress in South Africa by maintaining itsoperations in the country.   The company says it has spent more than $10 million in educationand training of blacks, housing and social programs in South Africa.Goodyear has adhered to the Sullivan Principles, a set of guidelinesfor companies operating in South Africa that address employment andother practices.   However, Barrett stated, ``with the prospect of ever-diminishingreturns on our South African investment, our responsibility to ourshareholders must take precedence.''   The sale will result in a one-time charge of about $44 million,after taxes, or 77 cents a share, which will be taken againstGoodyear's second-quarter results.   Over the past five years, excluding Goodyear, 195 U.S. companieshave divested their holdings in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
