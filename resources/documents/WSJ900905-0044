Entrepreneurs selling everything from wristwatches tocalendars that poke fun at Mr. Quayle say interest is stillstrong nearly two years after the election. &quot;I saw thewriting on the wall when he was elected,&quot; says John Wade, aconservative Republican and T-shirt merchant in Lenexa, Kan.His top seller: a T-shirt with the logo, &quot;President's PrayerClub -- Keep George Healthy.&quot;   In Arlington, Va., entrepreneur Walton Sullivan gets about40 orders a week for another hot T-shirt: It shows a ghoulishblack and white screaming face taken from Edvard Munch's &quot;TheScream,&quot; along with the words, &quot;President Quayle.&quot;   In Chicago, Computronics Discount Radar Detectors' $29.50Dan Quayle watches boost profits. Mr. Quayle's tie makes upthe hour and minute hands amid misplaced watch-face numbers.   Another popular item: a $9 record by the Capital Steps, apolitical-satire group in Washington. One ditty, sung to thetune of &quot;Has Anybody Seen My Gal,&quot; goes: &quot;Five-foot-10, hairlike Ken, looks like TV weathermen. . . Teeth of white, verybright, twice as smart as Vanna White. . .&quot;   Quayle-bashers haven't had much material to work withrecently -- and some fear sales may peter out. &quot;He's been ona very short leash lately. . . . He stays with the preparedtext,&quot; says Deborah Werksman, co-founder of the QuayleQuarterly, a $12-a-year periodical of humorously bitingarticles, letters and cartoons on the vice president and hiswife.   As for Mr. Quayle, a spokesman notes: &quot;The vice presidentadmires entrepreneurship in all forms.&quot;                                                                                                          Franchisers' Mergers   Creating More Strains                                                                                                          RISING MERGER activity will probably add to tensionsbetween franchisers and their franchisees.   People in the industry say mergers among franchisers arerising. In the past 18 months, for instance, Ponderosa mergedwith rival steakhouse chain Bonanza, Mr. Donut and Dunkin'Donuts joined forces, and Popeye's acquired competingfried-chicken purveyor Church's.   The mergers result in part from intensifying competitionthat is driving weak firms into the hands of strongerpartners. &quot;There are so many companies out there that aretechnically very sound but don't know how to sell franchisesor build the business,&quot; says Don Dwire of Dwire Group, aWaco, Texas, franchise holding company.   For franchisees, relations with new owners can be severelystrained. Sometimes franchisees end up disfranchised when anew owner converts old franchisees to a new system. Hardee'sFoods Systems failed to convert all 650 Burger Cheffranchises when it acquired that chain.   A Hardee's spokesman says, &quot;There was some falling out,but it was minimal.&quot; Hardee's is now converting the 640-unitRoy Rogers chain it bought this year.   New owners also can alter a franchiser's strategy. ErikWulff, a Chicago franchising lawyer, says Pillsbury angeredHaagen Dazs store franchisees after it bought the franchiserby emphasizing sales of the ice cream in grocery stores. Butrelations have improved, the company says.                                                                                                          Small Factories Aren't   Big on Modernization                                                                                                          THE SMALLER the factory, the less likely the owner willinvest anytime soon in automation, finds a recent survey ofmore than 600 metal-fabricating firms. Executives at only afifth of fabricators with sales under $5 million said theyinvested in factory automation in the past five years, andonly 17% intend to do so in the next three years.   In contrast, more than half of those from companies withsales exceeding $20 million have invested in factoryautomation. And half say they plan to begin or continuemodernizing.   The survey -- commissioned by McGladrey andamp; Pullen,Minneapolis-based accountants, and the Fabricators andManufacturers Association -- indicates the smallestfabricators have done far less to take advantage of many newtechnologies, such as bar coding, sales forecasting,just-in-time inventory techniques, statistical controls,computer-integrated manufacturing, and lasers.   Though respondents weren't asked why they balk at newtechnology, interviews with small-factory owners suggest theyoften consider it too costly. They compete by being creativewith machinery they already have.   Bill Meyer, part-owner of a precision sheet-metalfabricator in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., avoided spending as muchas $100,000 for a large milling machine by stretching thelimits of his small one. He is using his machine to makerobot tables for a customer by working on each table insections, rather than all at once, as a large machine would.The tables support assembly-line robots.   H. Blaine Fluth, president of a small metal-tube shapingconcern in Minneapolis, says he used his machines tosuccessfully develop new products in ways consideredimpossible by the salesmen who sold him the machines.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          FRANCHISEES of Canadian Tire shops in British Columbiaprovide a novel incentive to keep people in boring jobslonger: They pay up to $3,000 to send employees throughcollege while they work. Employees quit their jobs upongraduation. . . . People are the top cause of productivityproblems for small manufacturers, says a recent survey byGrant Thornton. Over half -- 56% -- blamed people forproductivity snafus; 27%, technology, and 16%, plant andequipment.</TEXT></DOC>
