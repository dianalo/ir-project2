Investors generally stayed on the sidelines to await either another retreat in stock prices or further evidence that the economy has entered a period of moderate growth, traders said.    Even so, stocks attracted enough buyers to permit the Dow Jones Industrial Average to rise 10.67 to 2065.26. The average had soared 52.28 points Friday following the government's report on August unemployment, which indicated that economic growth slowed last month and eased concern about the outlook for interest rates.    Stocks rallied in early trading, but a retreat that traders linked to profit-taking and a similar reversal in the bond market left prices narrowly mixed near midday. The market then firmed again as the afternoon progressed and held its gains until the close.    Without the kind of catalyst provided by the jobless data, however, the market reverted to its recent sluggish trading pace. New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 122.3 million shares, down from 159.8 million Friday.    &quot;Obviously, you've got some post-holiday lethargy to suffer with,&quot; said John A. Conlon Jr., director of the institutional equity division at Nikko Securities International. &quot;It's just terribly difficult for anyone to come with a compelling sense of urgency to buy equities at this point in time.&quot;    Among broader market averages, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.11 to 265.59, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 0.54 to 150.20. There were 808 issues advancing in price on the Big Board, while 626 declined.    A sharp downturn in oil prices triggered a rally in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which rose 11.95 to 869.18. October crude oil futures plunged 55 cents a barrel to $14.24 in New York trading.    Mr. Conlon said that the unemployment report wasn't enough to persuade most market participants to assume a more active role. &quot;We need price movement or another event to get people off the sidelines,&quot; he said.    Steven G. Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., suggested that the continued low level of activity reflects the market's lack of conviction about the outlook for both stocks and the economy.    Although interest rates have fallen sharply in the wake of the jobless data, Mr. Einhorn said, stocks still aren't attractively priced by comparison with either long-term bonds or short-term debt securities.    Should rates stabilize near their current levels, he said, the market would remain locked in the trading range that has prevailed during the past few months. The prospects for a sharp decline in stocks would diminish, he said, but rates are already high enough to restrain any rallies that may occur.    &quot;We need to see a material decline in bond yields before one should become active in the market,&quot; Mr. Einhorn said, adding that the latest rally is &quot;just another piece of evidence to suggest that the stock market can do what the bond market allows it to do -- no more and no less.&quot;    John D. Connolly, research director and chairman of the investment committee at Dean Witter Reynolds, agreed that any movement in stocks is likely to depend largely on activity in bonds. But he added that the jobless data and other recent reports indicating that economic growth is slowing have created the potential for gains in both markets.    &quot;There's some new information in the market that has to be confronted by the bears. The bear story has been that the economy is about to explode and we'll see much higher bond rates, but the information we've been receiving just doesn't square with that,&quot; Mr. Connolly said. &quot;It's hard to get a boom out of very high real interest rates and very low real income gains.&quot;    The downturn in oil prices bolstered airline stocks, which have been weak in recent sessions. AMR gained 1 5/8 to 44 7/8, NWA jumped 2 1/8 to 47 1/2, USAir Group climbed 1 1/2 to 37 3/8, Delta Air Lines rose 7/8 to 47 3/4 and UAL gained 1 3/8 to 91.    Meanwhile, some key technology issues extended their recent slump as International Business Machines went down 1 1/8 to 112 7/8, Digital Equipment dropped 1 7/8 to 92 5/8, Compaq Computer eased 1 1/2 to 52 5/8 and Motorola fell 1/4 to 42 1/4.    Grow Group plunged 4 to 11 3/4 on news that PPG Industries terminated its agreement to buy the company for $16.625 a share, or about $233 million. PPG didn't elaborate on the reasons for its decision.    Essex Chemical advanced 1 3/4 to 35 1/2 folowing its agreement to be acquired by Dow Chemical for $36 a share, or $366.1 million. The pact apparently ends a bidding contest that began in May with an unsolicited tender offer from Gurit-Heberlein, the company's joint venture partner in Europe.    Eaton gained 1 1/8 to 75 1/2. Its chairman, James R. Stover, said that the company expects continued earnings gains in the second half because of &quot;strong order books&quot; for its automotive parts and control products. In the first half, the company posted net income of $4.96 a share, up from $3.97 a year ago.    Waste Management gained 1 1/4 to 38 7/8. Analysts believe the company will benefit from an expected wave of new state laws to regulate solid-waste disposal. New York issued its first set of rules last week, and a company official said other states are likely to approve similar regulations. Other waste-disposal stocks moved higher as well; Browning-Ferris Industries rose 3/4 to 26 1/4 and Environmental Systems gained 5/8 to 13 1/4, while Gundle Environmental Services advanced 2 1/8 to 23 7/8 on the American Stock Exchange.    Varo fell 1 3/8 to 24 5/8 in the wake of United Scientific Holdings' decision not to pursue a planned $26-a-share takeover offer. The company has agreed to be acquired by Imo Delaval for $25 a share.    Genentech fell 2 to 19 1/8, apparently in response to Invitron's agreement to produce SmithKline Beckman's version of a bioengineered drug being pursued as a potential therapy against acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Genentech has its own version of the compound, known generically as CD4, in clinical trials.    The American Stock Exchange index gained 0.97 to 296.59. Amex volume totaled 7,930,000 shares, down from 8,550,000 Friday. There were 306 issues advancing, 243 declining and 294 unchanged.    Inter-City Gas jumped 2 1/8 to 18 3/8. Central Capital, which holds a 47% stake in the company, said it received two unsolicited expressions of interest regarding the possible purchase of part or all of Inter-City Gas.    Salem surged 1 3/8 to 13 5/8. An article in Barron's singled the company out as one of a few firms with very high cash and low debt levels.    R.G. Barry slipped 3/8 to 4 3/4 in the wake of a fire that destroyed one of its three Mexican plants. The company estimated that the fire would cause a loss of 3% to 4% of its projected 1988 sales. </TEXT></DOC>
