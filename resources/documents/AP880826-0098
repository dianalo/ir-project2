(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Television talk-show host Morton DowneyJr. will not be arrested for scuffling with a weekly newspapereditor because a prosecutor says he wants to devote his resourcesto more serious crimes.   Assistant State's Attorney Burton A. Kaplan said he rejected anarrest warrant charging breach of peace that had been prepared bypolice based on a complaint filed by Paul Bass, editor of the NewHaven Independent.   ``I denied the warrant, not based on the merits of the case _because I believe there was a violation by Mr. Downey _ but basedon other considerations, including the volume of business and theresources of this office,'' Kaplan said Thursday.   Kaplan said his staff in Superior Court can be used moreeffectively tackling more serious cases such as murders, rapes andother crimes.   Bass said Thursday that he had mixed feelings about the decision.   ``I understand Kaplan's need to prioritize,'' Bass said. ``Thecourts are overbooked with cases. ... I'm very glad he said in hisstatement that Downey broke the law.   But, he added, ``I think it's unfortunate that some guy who's acelebrity can get away with backing himself up with thousands ofgroupies and he can get away with attacking someone. If it was apoor black kid with three friends cheering him on, I think he wouldget arrested.''   Downey couldn't immedately be reached for comment. There was noone on his staff at WWOR-TV in Secaucus, N.J., at work early today,said a receptionist at the station.   New Haven attorney Ira B. L Grudberg, who represented Downey,said Thursday: ``Mr. Kaplan exercised his discretion wisely. Thereare more important things than this, notwithstanding my client'shigh visibility.''   Downey scuffled with Bass and James Motavelli, editor of theweekly Fairfield County Advocate, when tempers flared during astage show Aug. 14 at the Palace Performing Arts Center. The showfollowed the confrontational format of Downey's television show.   Bass' sister charged on stage and slapped Downey in the faceafter Bass and Motavelli walked off. The standing-room-onlyaudience of 2,000 cheered the incident.</TEXT></DOC>
