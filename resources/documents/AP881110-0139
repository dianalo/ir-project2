At a news conference, Sessions said investigators are trying todetermine whether statutes concerning wire fraud, malicious mischiefor unlawful access to stored communications may have been broken.   Earlier, the bureau had said it was focusing on a federal lawthat prohibits fraud or related activity in connection withcomputers, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.   Sessions also said the preliminary phase of the criminalinvestigation probably will be completed in the next two weeks.   Cornell student Robert T. Morris has told friends that he createdthe computer virus that disabled thousands of computers last week,but didn't intend for it to invade computer systems around thecountry.   ``We often look at intent as being knowing and intentional doingof an act which the law forbids and knowing that the law forbids itto be done,'' Sessions said. ``But we also have other statutes whichdeal simply with knowingly doing something.''   The malicious mischief statute which Sessions referred toprovides a maximum 10-year prison term for anyone who wilfullyinterferes with the use of any communications line controlled by theU.S. government.   The unlawful access law which the FBI director referred to makesit a crime to prevent authorized access to electronic communicationswhile they are in electronic storage and carries a maximum six-monthjail term absent malicious destruction or damage.</TEXT></DOC>
