Undecided Sens. Specter and Heflin will have major roles at next week's confirmation hearings. Specter, a moderate Pennsylvania Republican, has unanswered questions after meeting with Bork, but he will be under enormous party pressure to back him. Alabama's Heflin, a Democrat, wonders if Bork will honor court precedents, but he usually backs Reagan judicial appointees.    Bork does dry runs with White House lawyers and others to prepare. His foes try to line up prominent legal opponents, but some are reluctant to testify. Most Democrats think a filibuster is the only way to stop Bork, but Judiciary Chairman Biden says, &quot;I really think there's a much better chance to get 51 votes&quot; to beat Bork than 41 votes needed to sustain a filibuster.    The White House's latest strategy is to focus only on Bork's judicial record, and not on his more freewheeling academic writings.    INTEREST RATES generate political and economic nervousness.    Administration officials hope the Fed's tightening will obviate the need to raise interest rates during the 1988 election year. &quot;A little now will save having to do a lot later on,&quot; says one White House official. But some private analysts say faster growth will force new Fed chief Greenspan to seek higher rates in coming months, when Republicans and some Fed colleagues may be less receptive.    Market worries increase pressure on the administration to undertake serious budget talks with Congress. Though chances of major deficit cuts are slim, Reagan and Congress may be able to agree on $20 billion in cuts, including $10 billion in new taxes. Some administration officials argue that even a modest budget accord could help keep interest rates low next year.    REAGANITES FACE an uphill fight on arms sales to Saudi Arabia.    The White House hopes the increased Iranian threat in the Persian Gulf will soften previous opposition by Congress. One administration official says a $1 billion deal will be proposed in hopes of getting at least $300 million to $500 million. The White House may have to drop some weapons, such as Maverick anti-tank missiles.    Administration lobbyists work both sides of the Iran-Iraq war. They tell lawmakers that in the short run, Saudi Arabia is threatened by Iran, but that the long-run threat to the Saudis is from Iraq. But GOP hopefuls Dole and Kemp oppose the sales, and others advise against proposing them. The administration, one lawmaker warns, would be committing &quot;hara-kiri.&quot;    The White House team led by Baker will have to go all-out if the sales are to have a chance in Congress.    FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS between the U.S. and Poland will be re-established when Bush visits Warsaw this month. The plan is for the first exchange of ambassadors since the U.S. removed its envoy after Poland declared martial law in 1981. U.S. officials hope that such Eastern European ties will encourage more independence from Moscow.    DON'T CALL US: At the behest of U.S. officials, visiting Japanese Trade Minister Tamura drops plans to schedule formal meetings with members of Congress to try to fend off sanctions against Toshiba. An earlier lobbying trip by Tamura only fanned congressional anger, and U.S. officials privately had hoped he wouldn't return now.    REPUBLICANS SEE a chance to regain Senate control because of likely decisions by federal prosecutor Giuliani to challenge Democratic Sen. Moynihan and by Florida Rep. Mack to tackle Sen. Chiles, along with Wisconsin Sen. Proxmire's retirement. But those gains would be offset if former governors Robb of Virginia and Kerrey of Nebraska challenge GOP incumbents.    EVENHANDED BACKER: Lloyd Cutler, former counsel to President Carter, defends Bork as reasonable, citing his defense of the press in a libel case. Last year, Cutler supported Justice Scalia's nomination, citing the same case. Scalia and Bork sharply disagreed in the decision.    DISPUTES UNDERCUT major health and welfare legislation.    HHS Secretary Bowen threatens to recommend a veto of a catastrophic-care bill. He opposes a House-passed prescription-drug benefit for Medicare recipients as too costly. The drug industry also fights the provision for fear it could lead to federal price caps on such drugs. A possible compromise would limit the drugs covered.    Welfare revision runs into partisan bickering. Senate Democrats may try to make welfare part of broader, nonrelated legislation to shield it from GOP attacks. Critics say actions fall far short of a promised overhaul. Congress hasn't any plans for a &quot;wholesale restructuring of basic programs,&quot; complains Cliff Johnson, a lobbyist for the Children's Defense Fund.    Except for catastrophic care, Bowen is silent on top health and welfare issues. His office &quot;is really on autopilot,&quot; a Bowen aide says.    MINOR MEMOS: Simon's finance director, Bob Edgar, reveals the secret of funding the senator's presidential campaign: &quot;Lutheran money! It's rolling in.&quot; . . . A Washington flower shop advertises, &quot;We have more plants than the CIA.&quot; . . . The Supreme Court's decision in McNally vs. U.S., limiting mail-fraud cases against public officials, prompts Wedtech prosecutors to issue revised, &quot;McNallyed&quot; indictments. </TEXT></DOC>
