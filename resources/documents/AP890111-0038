Enthusiastic (or overzealous), incorruptible (or sanctimonious),dedicated (or ruthlessly ambitious), he cut a wide swath throughorganized crime, political corruption and Wall Street wickedness.   On Tuesday he announced his resignation, leaving New Yorkers tospeculate whether he will run for mayor and earn comparisons withanother diminutive Italian American who ran as a reformer _ FiorelloLaGuardia.   Mayor Edward I. Koch, entering the last year of his third term,praised Giuliani as a ``superb prosecutor;'' pointedly, he wishedGiuliani well in his future endeavors ``in the private sector.''   Giuliani, 44, said Tuesday he had ``not shut the door on runningfor mayor'' or any other office, though he held out the possibilitythat he would go into private practice as a lawyer.   But Giuliani is in a perfect position to run.   In 5{ years, his office has jailed the leaders of New York's fiveorganized crime families; broken the ``Pizza Connection'' heroinoperation; pressed insider trading cases that brought guilty pleasfrom Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine and an agreement to plead guilty byDrexel Burnham Lambert; convicted Rep. Mario Biaggi and the defensecontractor Wedtech on bribery charges.   He personally (and successfully) prosecuted the case againstBronx Democratic boss Stanley Friedman and four co-defendants oncharges they turned the city's Parking Violations Bureau into a cashcow.   His office brought tax charges against real estate moguls Harryand Leona Helmsley. He sought to have the Teamsters declared acorrupt enterprise and have the union taken over by the government.   He also has had a lock on the six o'clock news, appearing almostdaily to denounce wrongdoing (he once joined Sen. Alfonse D'Amato indressing as street scum and buying cocaine, to show how easy it was)or to announce indictments.   ``You couldn't distinguish between a Giuliani news conference atconviction and one at indictment,'' Gerald Stern, administrator ofthe state Commission on Judicial Conduct, once said. ``It's terriblyunfair. It distorts the administration of justice.''   Giuliani's retort: ``I can't imagine how I could possibly have alow profile given the cases we've done ... substantively, they'rehistoric cases. ... I don't conduct myself frivolously to seekpublicity.''   He has been the subject of magazine article after magazinearticle. They generally take one of two tacks, comparing him toEliot Ness, the crime-fighting hero of ``The Untouchables,'' orSavonarola, the 15th-century Italian cleric and infamous zealot.   If nothing else, Giuliani shares Savonarola's Catholicism. Bornin Brooklyn and raised on Long Island, he attended parochial schoolsand then Manhattan College, where he considered joining thepriesthood.   He decided against it (``Celibacy,'' he explained.) and decidedinstead to go to law school at New York University.   The law, he said, allowed him ``to read, think and debate aboutideas.''   Giuliani was an assistant U.S. attorney in the Manhattan officein the 1970s; it was he who persuaded Detective Robert Leuci toadmit to crimes committed with his partners, thus opening up thepolice scandal that was dramatized in the film ``Prince of theCity.''   Two tours at the Justice Department in Washington followed,separated by four years in private practice. In 1983, he wasassociate attorney general for criminal prosecutions _ thethird-ranking position in the department.   Then, though it appeared to be a demotion, he took the New Yorkjob. ``This is a job I always wanted to do,'' he said.   In the ensuing years, he has earned some admirers.   ``Several qualities have made Giuliani the Joe DiMaggio ofprosecutors,'' wrote Jack Newfield of the Daily News. ``He is smart,fearless, decisive, motivated. Most of all he has been smart in anera of slick.''   G. Robert Blakey, a Notre Dame professor, recalled that ThomasDewey _ the New York governor and Republican presidential candidate_ was a headline-chasing prosecutor in New York in the 1930s. ``Thedifference between Dewey and Giuliani is that Dewey simply bustedthe racketeers _ Giuliani's busting the rackets,'' Blakey said.   He also has made enemies _ some of them in his own party. Heclashed with his boss, former Attorney General Edwin Meese III.Giuliani fought to isolate Meese from all decision-making in theWedtech case while Meese was under investigation in that scandal.   Giuliani's assistant, Edward Little, called Meese ``a sleaze'' incourt. Meese called the comment ``first-year law student stuff,''but Giuliani said he was ``ready to defend it, anytime, anywhere,anyplace.''   Once a Democrat, Giuliani switched to the GOP after GeorgeMcGovern was nominated for president in 1972. He has remainedsteadfast in his other major allegiance: He is a diehard fan of theNew York Yankees.   He is married to Donna Hanover, a anchorwoman on WPIX-TV. Theirson, Andrew, is 3.   ``If I never hold another public office in my life,'' he oncesaid, ``I can look back on this public office and say, `I did areally good job. My son could be proud of me.'''</TEXT></DOC>
