<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-52-0254 </DOCNO><TEXT>A prescription is given to specify the high-k behavior for the Gaussianwidth of a Schroedinger wave functional for a scalar field in a Robertson-Walkerflat background. The prescription corresponds to a construction whichproduces nearly Minkowski behavior for the high-frequency modes, andis analogous to the well-known ''adiabatic method'' previously developedin the canonical formalism. The specified high-k behavior leads to divergencesin andless;T/sub {mu}//sub {nu}/andgt; which agree with the poles appearing in theDeWitt-Schwinger expansion of this quantity.</TEXT></DOC>
