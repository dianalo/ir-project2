Michael Nicley, U.S. Border Patrol agent, sits in a green sedan by a highway checkpoint. He scans the torrent of vehicles on Interstate 5, knowing that undocumented immigrants are whizzing north to Los Angeles right under his nose.    Suddenly something grabs his attention. &quot;Here we go,&quot; he says.    He hits the accelerator and the car lurches into the heavy weekend traffic. Seventy miles an hour, 80 miles an hour, 85. &quot;That brown sedan,&quot; says the boyish-looking agent. &quot;Just watch.&quot;    Mr. Nicley (pronounced Nicely) shines a flashlight into the driver's window of the aging Ford LTD. A small, nervous-looking man stares straight ahead, hands locked in a death grip on the wheel. &quot;Pull over,&quot; Mr. Nicley orders.    But when the agent springs open the LTD's trunk, it is empty. It is thickly carpeted, though, a sign that it may sometimes carry indocumentados. Two more signs: the oversize tires and the air shocks. Agent Nicley looks frustrated as he lets the man go. &quot;I'll bet that in the time I had him over,&quot; he says, &quot;a bunch of other guys drove right by with their loads.&quot;    This is the nation's busiest inland immigration checkpoint. It overlooks the Pacific about 70 miles north of the Mexican border. Every week, thousands of the hopeful approach it on the main road linking Mexico to the fields and factories of California. It is their last barrier between Latin America and freedom, jobs and families.    When the checkpoint is &quot;up&quot; -- it is sometimes down because of heavy traffic or road conditions -- agents stand for hours in the middle of traffic that is slowed to a crawl and funneled into, at most, three lanes instead of the usual four. The agents rely mainly on instinct and luck to stem the flow of illegales. As a bonus, they also stop a good amount of drug smuggling. Interstate 5 has become a major pipeline for traffickers hauling up loads of heroin, marijuana and cocaine.    The agents also face their share of American fugitives, many of whom panic when they see the brightly lit sign announcing &quot;Stop Here: U.S. Officers.&quot; Standing there screening traffic, the green-uniformed agents, though armed, are vulnerable to attack by such fugitives and by drunks, AWOL Marines and other belligerent types.    The checkpoint can be just as hazardous for the undocumented, who put themselves at the mercy of the smugglers, or coyotes. Agents often revive passengers who are wedged behind fake paneling, stacked like cordwood into vans or piled into semitrailers that drip urine and sweat from the overcrowding. &quot;It makes you sick to see little kids stuck in the trunk or the women who you know get raped or beaten,&quot; says agent Arthur Lamberson, a lanky 15-year veteran, as he monitors an endless line of vehicles. &quot;These guys are brutal.&quot;    Desperate illegales will hide almost anywhere -- under car hoods, around radiators, behind truck grilles. Creative smugglers try to drive them through in expensive cars, limousines, taxicabs and even hearses. Agents recently broke up a ring that used custom-painted vehicles that looked like express-mail and retail delivery trucks.    Officials guess that only one-third of the illegal entries are halted, but believe that entries will decline because of the nation's 14-month-old immigration law. Figures suggest that the law, under which employers can be fined for hiring undocumented workers, may indeed be having some effect. This station's 70 agents apprehended 69,346 people in fiscal 1986; the number dropped about 28% in fiscal 1987, to 49,047.    By nightfall on this particular Sunday, traffic is thick -- at least 6,000 vehicles an hour -- and the hide-and-seek begins in earnest.    7:40 p.m. &quot;U-Haul! U-Haul!&quot; an agent yells, running after a truck barreling through a roadside inspection area. &quot;They're gonna bail!&quot; Agent Nicley exclaims as he roars away after them.    Sure enough, the truck quickly grinds to a halt and the smugglers leap into the chaparral. Two chase units squeal up and several agents dive after the coyotes. Agent Nicley unlocks the back of the truck. Twelve men and two young women stare stoically into the flashlight. &quot;We've got a load,&quot; Agent Elijio Rivas radios back.    Such &quot;port-running&quot; isn't uncommon. An escaped convict died in a shootout last fall after leading Border Patrol agents and police on a high-speed chase through neighboring counties.    The agents are full of war stories. They recall two agents abducted from the nearby checkpoint at Temecula, Calif., and murdered by smugglers in the early 1970s. More recently, a Mexican fugitive near San Clemente shot an agent in the legs. The agent has returned to work but now limps.    8:20 p.m. A northbound van veers from the right lane to the center of the freeway just south of the station. The doors fly open while it is still moving, and men begin pouring out onto the brushy divider. Before anyone can stop them, seven people run madly into oncoming 70-mile-an-hour traffic and vanish into the darkened scrub near the beach.    Most smugglers simply surrender when caught. But novices will cook up tall tales, insisting that the stowaways must have crawled into their trunks while they were using the restroom at a gas station.    11:40 p.m. Several officers stand about the cramped station, swapping stories and waiting for the next shift. The station outgrew its squat brick facility years ago; apprehensions are more than 500% higher now than when the building opened in 1970. On busy nights, as many as 400 people cram the holding cells designed for half that number.    2:45 a.m. A lone pickup truck rolls into the floodlights, and the three men in the cab look glassy-eyed with fear. &quot;Hi there,&quot; Agent Lamberson says. &quot;Can you turn off your truck, please?&quot; The driver yanks apart the wires dangling from the smashed ignition. The stolen truck contains eight more undocumented men lying in the bed. &quot;Another load,&quot; Agent Lamberson says.    After a few years on the job, agents are wise to the smugglers' tactics, like dressing in American clothes or using women as decoys. &quot;You know there's a problem when a woman is bouncing a baby on her lap and the kid's trying to claw her eyes out,&quot; Agent Nicley says. That usually means a parent is hidden in the trunk.    All agents speak at least passable Spanish, which is a necessity. It also helps to have quick reflexes. Earlier in the day, an agent just missed being crushed by an out-of-control car.    The nation's 34 checkpoints have been repeatedly challenged in court by immigrants' rights and advocacy groups, which charge, among other things, that agents harass the indocumentados or stop people just because they look Hispanic. In 1974, court action by a smuggler resulted in a 15-month shutdown of the San Clemente station. The upshot: Agents at a checkpoint now must have a warrant or establish probable cause to conduct a search.    4a.m. T.J. Brady, watch commander, inspects the night's tally. &quot;Well, there's 236 aliens, four stolen vehicles, three U.S. citizens charged with narcotics violations, three suspected smugglers,&quot; the lean, softspoken senior agent says. &quot;Kind of slow, but that's about right for this time of year.&quot;    Outside, abandoned vehicles dot the highway shoulder. Inside, the cells are nearly empty now. And several miles north, hundreds of new immigrants are on their way to work. </TEXT></DOC>
