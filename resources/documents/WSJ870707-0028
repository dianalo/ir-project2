U.S. officials said they hope an agreement phasing out subsidies over 10 years can be negotiated by the end of 1988, when the Reagan presidency winds up. But the idea faces strong opposition from other governments and from Congress, making it unlikely ever to be adopted in full, or in any form anytime soon.    The administration has been saying for months that it would propose expedited talks on phasing out world farm subsidies, so that yesterday's announcement wasn't a surprise. But the detailed U.S. proposal, presented at trade talks in Geneva, presented such a broad definition of &quot;subsidy&quot; -- including nearly every type of government aid to farmers -- that it may catch even free-traders off guard. The proposal will now be studied by delegates to the 93-nation negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    If other nations are willing to drop all subsidies, the administration is offering to dismantle the vast U.S. federal farm program, including even such longstanding features as the agricultural extension service, which offers advice, and crop insurance. Hardly a single U.S. farm program would survive such an agreement.    In the place of existing programs, the U.S. and other countries would be limited to only two kinds of government farm aid: direct cash payments that aren't tied in any way to crop production or marketing, and bona fide food aid.    &quot;All U.S. programs and policies are on the negotiating table,&quot; the administration declared. But U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter cautioned that the U.S. wouldn't drop its farm programs unless other nations, especially the European Community and Japan, do so, too. &quot;We have no intention whatsoever of unilaterally disarming in the agriculture area,&quot; he said.    The major industrial nations, meeting in Venice, Italy, last month, generally endorsed the idea of dropping subsidies, but resisted U.S. efforts to set a timetable or to expedite agriculture talks. The summit communique also hinted that other countries will try to preserve large loopholes.    Separately, Nico Wegter, a spokesman for the European Community Commission, said yesterday, &quot;We think this is not a realistic proposal. . . . In principle, we are in favor of negotiation to diminish farm subsidies. But Reagan's proposal goes beyond the scope&quot; of previous accords.    But in Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney welcomed the U.S. plan as &quot;a bold move&quot; that &quot;challenges all countries interested in trade liberalization to move towards a world where production and trade decisions will not be distorted by governmental intervention.&quot;    In the U.S., tobacco, rice, cotton and other agriculture subsidies have strong supporters in Congress. When asked who in Congress would support such a 10-year phase-out, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng couldn't name any Democrats. &quot;It's not a congressional issue at this point, but we have met with the agriculture committees of both houses, and we've been pleased at the response we have there,&quot; he said.    Initial reaction from Congress was supportive of the general approach, but cautious about details.    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) said in a statement that &quot;the administration has raised the stakes in the complex game of world agricultural trade. What we need to do is see whether other countries are willing to put their subsidies on the table.&quot; But Mr. Leahy warned that U.S. farmers musn't be left &quot;without any sort of domestic life raft&quot; and that &quot;if the administration doesn't work closely with Congress, it runs the real risk of having its position vetoed at home.&quot;    Unhappiness over the Reagan adminstration's farm policies has become a serious political problem for GOP candidates in the Midwest, despite increased spending for subsidies under the current administration. While dissatisfied with the status quo, however, few House or Senate members in either party have yet endorsed the administration's oft-repeated desire to eliminate virtually all agriculture subsidies. </TEXT></DOC>
