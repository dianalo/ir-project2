A proposed 100-year agreement that would merge the business operations of the Free Press and the News is in the hands of Attorney General Edwin Meese. The agreement would allow both chains to reap profits from papers that are now deeply in the red.    But an administrative law judge appointed by Mr. Meese recommended Dec. 30 that Mr. Meese reject the proposed merger. He said that Knight-Ridder didn't prove that the Free Press was locked in a &quot;downward spiral&quot; of declining revenues and circulation, and therefore didn't meet the federal requirements that allows competing newspapers to merge operations.    Knight-Ridder's board announcement to close the Free Press if the joint operating agreement is rejected came after the stock market closed. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Knight-Ridder closed at $36.50, down $1.125, while Gannett closed at $34.25, down 25 cents.    Knight-Ridder will file a formal answer to the law judge's recommendation before Jan. 29, Chairman Alvah Chapman said. There is no deadline for Mr. Meese to make his decision. </TEXT></DOC>
