The lawyers reportedly are waiting to see whether disgracedhigh-yield bond financier Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham LambertInc. is indicted in a case based on information supplied by Boeskybefore moving to have Boesky's three-year term shortened.   The attorneys believe an indictment of Milken would be furtherevidence of the value of Boesky's information in weeding out WallStreet corruption, according to sources close to the case, who spokeon condition of anonymity.   On Friday, Boesky attorney Robert McCaw said Boesky has notapplied for parole from the minimum security prison camp in Lompoc,Calif., and has no current plans to do so.   Boesky becomes eligible for parole on March 21. He began servinghis sentence at the 44,000-acre former military barracks about 150miles north of Los Angeles last March 23.   ``He will seek a parole hearing at the point where his advisersthink it is most likely he would get some kind of favorableconsideration,'' McCaw said. ``There has been no parole hearing datescheduled. There is nothing imminent.''   McCaw said there was ``no chance'' Boesky would be released byMarch on parole and ``relatively little chance'' he would be freedon a judge's order.   Parole hearings at the 689-inmate prison, known as ``Club Fed''because of recreation facilities including a tennis court and boccieball court, are held every other month and Boesky is not on theMarch docket, Lompoc unit manager Jim Finley said.   Under federal prison sentencing guidelines, Boesky's earliestpossible non-parole release date based on good behavior is April 4,1990.   Boesky, once Wall Street's best-known speculator in the stocks ofpotential takeover targets, is now working on a prison cleanup crew,McCaw said.   He is likely to be released early only if Manhattan federal judgeMorris E. Lasker, who sentenced Boesky, rewards his cooperation inhelping nail other Wall Street felons.   Last April, Boesky's lawyers asked Lasker to reduce his sentenceon grounds that information Boesky gave the government unearthedother fraud cases, including the mammoth investigation of Drexelthat resulted in a record $650 million plea-bargain settlement inDecember.   The attorneys asked Lasker to wait until this past October tohear their motion, but have delayed even longer.   Sources close to the case said Boesky's lawyers are waiting tosee whether Milken is indicted on fraud charges before pressing forBoesky's release.   Milken is expected to be charged as a result of Drexel's pleadeal, in which the securities firm agreed to pay $650 million infines and restitution and plead guilty to six felony counts.   Boesky could be expected to ask Lasker for a hearing on earlyrelease ``fairly quickly'' after Milken is indicted, one sourcesaid, adding that a pending final agreement on terms of the Drexelsettlement also could help Boesky's case.   ``In the atmosphere of trying to show that his post-sentence andpresent cooperation has shown real tangible fruits, it's better thatit's settled,'' said the source.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird said there has been no changein the status of Boesky's case. He declined to comment on whetherthe government would oppose any early release request.   Boesky, 52, stunned the financial world in November 1986 when hepaid the Securities and Exchange Commission $100 million to settlecharges he illegally used nonpublic insider information to profit insecurities deals. He was banished from the securities business forlife.   He then cooperated in a massive federal probe that has resultedin criminal or civil charges in nearly two dozen cases in the UnitedStates and Britain. In return, Boesky was allowed to plead guilty toa single count of conspiracy to lie to the SEC.</TEXT></DOC>
