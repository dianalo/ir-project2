(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>AS CD-ROM ROLLS OUT, TEXT RETRIEVAL WINSandM;The population of CD-ROM players in corporations today is up.andP;  The cost ofCD-ROM drives is down, and eventually they may even be given away.andM;On the software side, the text retrieval market is projected to grow, andmore software is becoming available.andM;However, not all drives operate to one standard.andP;  And the technology may beoutpacing the ability of MIS to figure out what to do with it.andP;  Textmanagement does not appear to be driven by MIS requirements.andM;The installed base of CD-ROM readers grew to 171,000 in 1988, a four-foldincrease over 1987, according to Rich Bowers, executive director of theOptical Publishing Association in Columbus, Ohio.andP;  The first readers came outin 1985, he said.andM;The cost of CD-ROM drives several years ago was $10,000 or more.andP;  Today, thedrives cost $600 to $700.andP;  In quantity, the price comes down to $500.andP;  Someobservers predict PCs will eventually be delivered with buil-in CD-ROMdrives.andM;&quot;Costs have dropped to the point where publishers will give away the CD-ROMreader,&quot; said Dick Shriver, senior vice president and technology chief atMcGraw-Hill Corp., New York, one of a number of publishing organizationsmoving to capitalize on the emerging CD-ROM market.andP;  &quot;Its price isinconsequential compared to the value of the information we're selling,&quot; hesaid.andM;Shipments of CD-ROM text retrieval software grew from 559 to 22,000 from 1986through 1988, according to International Data Corp., a Framingham,Mass.-based research firm.andP;  The installed base of CD-ROM text retrievallicenses grew from 763 to 24,400 in that time, IDC said.andM;Bowers estimates 50 text retrieval products are available today.andM;&quot;We're all attracted by the enormous potential of this business,&quot; said KurtMueller, president of Dataware, a Cambridge, Mass.-based supplier of textretrieval software.andM;Publishers are in the forefront of CD-ROM products suppliers.andP;  McGraw-Hillhas six products today, and at least a dozen in the works.andP;  The company'sComputer PC Plus Corporate Text product includes annual reports filed bythousands of public companies, with numbers and text in the document.andM;&quot;It's got simple text retrieval software we've developed in-house,&quot; saidScott Taylor, CD-ROM Channel Champion at McGraw-Hill's Englewood, Colo.,andO;offices.andM;The Concise Encyclopedia of Science and Technology from McGraw-Hill wasdeveloped by Reference Technology.andP;  It incorporates text retrieval softwarefrom Fulcrum Technologies, Ottawa, Canada.andM;Most text retrieval players today say they target the &quot;business&quot; market.andO;Some say they target MIS.andP;  But it is not yet clear what applications MIS maypursue with text retrieval software and CD-ROM hardware.andM;Text management player Information Dimensions, Dublin, Ohio, which makesBasis, decided a year ago not to pursue the CD-ROM retrieval market.andP;  &quot;We gotinvolved in CD-ROM in 1985 with our MicroBasis product,&quot; said Dave Ditmars,marketing manager with the firm.andP;  &quot;But we're no longer offering that productbecause the market didn't develop.andP;  The technology is advancing much fasterthan business needs are.&quot;andM;Dataware, on the other hand, is targeting its text retrieval tools to MIS.andO;&quot;Corporate clients need a development platform to address databases,graphics, and text.andP;  We have solid capabilities in all three areas,&quot; saidMueller.andP;  &quot;We're positioning ourselves as the company to offer the MIS groupa single development platform.&quot;andM;Some suppliers of text retrieval software for PC and host platforms are nowtargeting the CD-ROM market as well.andP;  AskSam Systems in Perry, Fla., sells aPC-based text product--also called AskSam.andM;According to Mike McKinney, vice president, the firm is considering sellingits package for use on both CD-ROM write-once, read-many (Worm) machines.andO;The company is talking to several publishers which may bundle the AskSamproduct with their databases.andM;&quot;The only change we'd have to make has to do with the temporary files thepackage writes when it does sorts,&quot; McKinney says.andP;  &quot;We'd have to put thetermporary files on the hard disk, or wherever the user wants them, insteadof on the Worm or CD-ROM.&quot;andM;Besides MIS and business in general, the text retrieval players are targetingfirms supplying products on CD-ROM disks.andM;Suppliers are differentiating their software either by features or byportability across hardware platforms.andP;  Mueller of Dataware, whichconcentrates on features, lauded his CD Answer package's support for eightdifferent indexing techniques.andM;To help publishers customize their packages, Fulcrum's package--calledFul/Text--provides an application programming interface.andP;  Through this,publishers can access the underlying retrieval technology.andP;  Licensees ofFul/Text include Philips International B.V., Hewlett-Packard Co., and CPTCorp., among others.andM;&quot;The end user of that technology has no idea that Fulcrum is in there,&quot; saysPeter Eddison, director of marketing at Fulcrum.andP;  &quot;But thaths fine, becausethe value of search software is when it's used as a component of somethingelse.andP;  You don't want to find information for its own sake; you want to useinformation with applications.&quot;andM;Fulcrum makes its product available on a variety of hardware platforms,including Unix machines, VAXs, PCs, and LANs.andM;Dataware's Mueller believes that publishers will turn more and more to theoption of buying rather than building in-house.andM;Technical CD-ROM issues that remain include the fact that most CD-ROM drivesare not erasable, and the fact that no single CD-RO, standard has yet beenaccepted.andM;The cost of distribution has been reduced, but is still an importantconsideration.andP;  Today it costs some $1,500 for a firm with masteringequipment to press a disk.andP;  The cost per blank disk, holding 600Mb, is about$2.andM;As for standards, a CD-ROM player is usually configured to read one operatingsystem and database only.andP;  Even large users of CD-ROM drives have not yetpicked one standard to implement uniformly.andP;  McGraw-Hill's Taylor said, &quot;Wehave about 200 operating units in the company, every one with its ownperspective of what works for them.&quot;andP;  He agrees there is not likely to be&quot;one [CD-ROM text retrieval] standrad that satisfies everyone's needs.&quot;andM;If any one CD-ROM software standard exists, it is the High Sierra standardfor the disks' tables of content.andP;  Put forward by Microsoft, Apple, and agroup of manufacturers, the scheme standardizes the format for each disk'slabel.andP;  This way, everyone can read the disk's title, its manufacturer, andthe table of contents of the disks regardless of who the disk's publisher is.andO;High Sierra has been adopted by the International Organization of Standards.andM;&quot;Those that don't follow the standard generally have justifiable reasons,such as the peculiarity of their product,&quot; said Optical Publishing's Bowers.andM;High Sierra standardizes on the table of contents, but that's where thesoftware similarities end.andP;  Each CD-ROM publisher and text retrieval vendorhas its own way of endcoding onto the disk.andP;  Each disk comes with textretrieval software.andM;CD-ROM publishers do tend to standardize within their product lines.andP;  SilverPlatter Information Inc. in Wellesley Hills, Mass., uses its own textretrieval system throughout its 20 database products, targeting healthsciences, education, and business markets.andP;  The method is called Spirs, forSilver Platter Information Retrieval Software.andM;Essentially a keyword system, Spirs allows users to define free text andfielded information, a trait shared by many of the packages on the market.andO;And Spirs allows something called lateral searching--the ability to go intothe index and then search directly.andM;An August 1988 Dataquest report cautions, &quot;Looking down the road, it is clearthat the document of tomorrow will pose new retrieval challenges for softwaredevelopers.&quot;andM;But given the speed at which CD-ROM text retrieval software is developing, itwill be just a matter of time before these issues are resolved.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
