(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal report Thursday concluded thatracial animosities between Indians and non-Indians have escalatedin northern Wisconsin during the past five years of tribalspearfishing.   The report said the rise in hostilities centered on Indiantreaty rights, and was most noticeable because of increased racistattacks on Chippewa spearfishers.   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said he hopes the report, released by theWisconsin Advisory Committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission,will spur Congress to address the conflicts.   ``It's about time the federal government said, `You know what,we should do something,''' Thompson said. ``They're the ones whoset policy.''   But Thompson said despite attempts at negotiations among treatyrights factions, the issue ultimately would be decided in the U.S.Supreme Court.   Wisconsin's six Chippewa Indian tribes retain the right tospearfish, hunt, cut timber and gather food on off-reservationlands under 19th century court-affirmed treaties that cedednorthern Wisconsin to the U.S. government.   In recent years, opponents to those rights have staged large andsometimes hostile protests at boat landings and lakes where theChippewa spearfish each spring. Protesters contend it's unfair toallow only the Chippewa to legally spearfish, since the method isvery efficient.   Last year, the protests escalated into rock-throwing andname-calling incidents and large police forces were called in tokeep the peace. Some 200 protesters were arrested during thedemonstrations.   James L. Baughman, committee chairman of the report, said,``Overall, the information received indicated that little haschanged since the committee's last review of Indian treaty rightsin 1984, except for an increase in racial polarization.''   The committee members said confrontations where the Indiansspearfish have the potential to become even more violent in futureyears.   ``The increased hostility has been particularly provoked byspearfishing,'' Baughman said.   The seven-member committee sent the report to the Civil RightsCommission after it was unanimously endorsed.   Efforts to negotiate settlements that would pay the tribesmillions of dollars to curtail its treaty rights have been rejectedduring the past year by tribal members.   The report contained no recommendations on how to deal with theconflicts, but detailed incidents of increased racism since the1984 study.   The report said racism was reflected in slogans such as ``Save aWalleye, Spear an Indian'' and ``Save a Deer, Shoot an Indian''found on hats, handguns and bumper stickers sold in northernWisconsin.   Baughman said the creation of organized anti-treaty rightsgroups in recent years also has fostered racism.   ``They've served as a catalyst,'' Baughman said. ``They've madeit a more emotional, more spirited issue than it needs to be.''   But Chuck Valliere, vice chairman of Protect American's Rightsand Resources, which was formed about four years ago, said hisgroup doesn't promote racist attitudes, despite the presence ofracism in northern Wisconsin.   ``I think our role is more to promote education about treatyrights issues,'' he said. ``I think that it's (racism) justsomething that comes out on the side. And it comes from bothsides.''   The committee reported complaints about lack of publicinformation available about Indian treaty rights and the need forIndian culture and history in curriculum.   It also said lack of complete, accurate news media coverage wasa complaint lodged by many people.   Willie Nunnery, a Madison attorney and committee member, saidthe state government cannot wash its hands of the issue.   ``Shifting all of this to the federal government is likeshifting the buck,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
