The pioneering machines are the first of several so-calledmultimedia computers that are also expected from AppleComputer Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. Andthey are expected to play a crucial role in Tandy's strategyfor selling personal computers through its 7,000 Radio Shackstores in the next decade.</LP><TEXT>   Tandy and other computer companies hope multimediacomputers will attract a new group of buyers because thesecomputers will be able to run software as entertaining astelevision and as informative as encyclopedias. A softwareprogram on the life of Ludwig van Beethoven, for instance,could display the composer's portrait, play his music andoffer reams of historical information retrieved at the user'sown pace.   At an average price of about $3,000, Tandy machines areexpensive when compared with other personal computers. Butthey are aggressively priced when compared with similarsystems that now can cost $5,000 or more. The company is alsoexpected to offer multimedia upgrade kits for Tandy and otherpersonal computers that includes a compact-disk-like driveand stereo sound add-in board for about $800.   Although a lack of software has hindered the growth oftoday's multimedia computers, Tandy hopes that by introducingseveral machines, it will persuade more software developersto create imaginative programs.   Tandy plans to sell multimedia computers first to schoolsand businesses. In the long term, company executives believeall personal computers will have multimedia capabilities.   Analysts also are optimistic about multimedia computers.&quot;People will like using a multimedia computer more than anormal computer,&quot; says editor of P.C. Letter, Stewart Alsop.&quot;The Tandy machines are a major step forward to creating afundamentally different kind of computer.&quot;   Each of Tandy's new computers will feature a powerfulmicroprocessor, a highresolution color display, a circuitboard that produces compact disk-quality sound through a pairof speakers and a disk reader known as a compact disk-readonly memory or CD-ROM drive.
