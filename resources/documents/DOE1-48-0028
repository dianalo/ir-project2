Briefly discussed are the possible techniques of repair.A genetic code exists for a highly efficient system of repair. Usinggenetic engineering techniques, it will be possible to transfer thisinformation into sensitive human cells, thus increasing their radiationresistance. (M.D.). 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
