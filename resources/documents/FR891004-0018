Background</ITAG>The Prompt Payment Act (P.L. 97-177) established standards for the paymentof contractor invoices. On October 17, 1988, the President signed PublicLaw 100-496, known as the Prompt Payment Act Amendments of 1988. Amongother things, these amendments establish a thirty day payment period forcontractor payments and eliminate an additional 15 day grace period previouslyallowed for Federal agencies to make invoice payments without interestpenalty.In making voucher payments, EPA relies on its project officers to ensurevouchers are accurate based on goods or services received. Under EPA'sinternal processing requirements, these project officers are also requiredto distribute invoiced costs among various elements of accounting datato ensure the correct funds are used in paying invoices.The requirement for project officers to assign accounting data to contractorinvoices has delayed EPA payments to contractors causing some paymentsto be made outside the periods required by the Prompt Payment Act. By requiringcontractors to indicate applicable accounting information under this interimrule, EPA can better ensure timely payment to contractors. Additionally,by having copies of invoices sent directly to project officers and ContractingOfficers, and requiring that invoices have the same period of performanceas progress reports, EPA can more quickly and accurately verify invoiceinformation.This regulation is published as an interim rule due to the urgency of makingchanges to comply with the Prompt Payment Act Amendments of 1988. The FederalAcquisition Regulation (FAR) 1.501-3(b) permits publication of regulationswithout the opportunity for advance comments when urgent and compellingcircumstances make solicitation of comments impracticable prior to theeffective date of coverage.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Executive Order 12291</ITAG>OMB Bulletin No. 85-7, dated December 14, 1984, establishes the requirementsfor Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review of agency procurementregulations. This regulation does not fall within any of the categoriescited in this Bulletin requiring OMB review.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this rule does not proposeany information collection requirements, which would require the approvalof OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The EPA certifies this rule does not exert a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. The change in invoice distributionrequires only one additional copy of an invoice be provided to EPA. Therequirement for contractors to have the same period of performance forboth invoices and progress reports reflects existing practices for manycontractors and should require only minimal changes for small entitiesnot already in compliance. The requirement for contractors to include accountinginformation on invoices requires contractors to include information clearlyidentified on contracts, work assignments, or delivery orders. This shouldrequire only minimal changes to invoicing procedures for small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1532 and 1552</ITAG>Government procurement, Contract financing, Solicitation provisions andcontract clauses.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Chapter 15 of Title 48 Code ofFederal Regulations is amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1532_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
