Hitchin, novelist Fay Weldon and literary editor NicholasShakespeare of the London Daily Telegraph chose the novel from alist of 80 for the prize, which carries an award of $2,650.   The novel is named for verses the prophet Mohammed removed fromthe Koran, the holy book of Islam, on grounds they were inspired bySatan.   Rushdie, 41, was born in Bombay and has won prizes for earliernovels, including ``Midnight's Children'' in 1981.   He said Tuesday he had received death threats from Moslems when``Satanic Verses'' was published in September.   ``I hope the prime minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, islistening,'' Rushdie said. ``I'm still optimistic that the ban willbe lifted and every bit helps. This prize certainly will.''   Hitchin, manager of a bookstore chain, said in a telephoneinterview: ``There have been protests in our shops by Moslems. Wehave had threats of boycotts, picketing and arson.''   He described the novel as ``remarkable and totally exceptional,with wonderful passages about Asian communities in London. There'snothing blasphemous in it against any religion.''   Ms. Weldon, who announced the winner in a ceremony atWhitbread's, a brewing company, called the novel an ``extraordinaryoutburst of literary energy.''   It is about the conflict of good and evil, represented by twoIndian survivors from an airliner blown up by terrorists. Thesurvivors take on the attributes of the angel Gabriel and Satan.</TEXT></DOC>
