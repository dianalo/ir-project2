LOUIS -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. reported record sales andearnings for the first quarter but said price discounting bycompetitors was resulting in company belt-tightening.   The nation's largest brewer said net income totaled $182.5million, or 64 cents a share, a 9.2% increase from lastyear's $167.1 million, or 58 cents a share. Sales rose 8.1%,to $2.59 billion, from $2.39 billion.</LP><TEXT>   While beer sales to wholesalers hit a record 20.1 billionbarrels, a 2.9% increase, and rose 4% at retail during thequarter, the company said discount pricing that began lastsummer requires heavy marketing expenditures.   To offset those costs, Chairman and President August A.Busch III said Anheuser has implemented a hiring freeze forthe year, reduced health insurance costs and cut bonuses formanagement.   &quot;We believe these steps will allow us to reach reasonableearnings growth in 1990 despite our higher level of pricepromotion activity,&quot; he told shareholders at the company'sannual meeting yesterday. He termed the increased promotionalactivity a short-term strategy, but added that while Anheuserhas no intention of starting a price war, it would meetcompetitive pricing levels in most markets.   To capture sales, Miller Brewing Co., a unit of PhilipMorris Cos., Coors Brewing Co. and other competitors lastsummer cut prices on premium beers. Eventually, Anheuser wasforced to meet that competition, as what Mr. Busch termed&quot;aggressive price promotion tactics and emphasis on low-pricebeer began to hamper our ability to get retailer ad anddisplay space.&quot;   Despite those pressures, Anheuser implemented a priceincrease this past February, which the competition followed.   Company officials also confirmed they intend to spendabout $30 million on a media campaign to stimulate sales ofits Budweiser premium beers.</TEXT></DOC>
