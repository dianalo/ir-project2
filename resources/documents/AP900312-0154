ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bronze bust of former Sen. J. WilliamFulbright, D-Ark., was presented to the Kennedy Center on Monday tocommemorate his little-publicized role in the creation of thenational performing arts center on the banks of the Potomac River.   Fulbright, 84, was accompanied by his bride of two days, theformer Hariet Mayor, to a small ceremony in an Opera House lounge.``As ugly as I am, I think it's wonderful,'' he said of the bust bysculptor Gretta Bader of Stanford, Calif.   Fulbright recalled that he accompanied the Soviet ambassador toa performance of the Bolshoi Ballet in a local movie theater in1957. The theater was such a bad locale, he said, that heintroduced legislation the next day authorizing a national culturalcenter in Washington.   After Congress approved the bill in 1958, Kennedy Centerofficials said, Fulbright ``provided extraordinary energy andleadership'' during a turbulent period when questions of financialsupport, construction site, architectural design and administrationof the center were debated.   Roger L. Stevens, founding chairman of the Kennedy Center whocelebrated his 80th birthday Monday, said Fulbright's role hadnever been fully recognized. ``If it had not been for people likehim, we would never have succeeded in making the Kennedy Center areality,'' he said.   Fulbright said the center represents the ``extremely important''role that the arts play in ``humanizing our society.''   The center, which opened in 1971, is the only official nationalmemorial to John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963.   Among the reception guests were J. Carter Brown, director of theNational Gallery of Art; Katharine Graham, chairman of TheWashington Post Co.; James H. Billington, librarian of Congress,and Kennedy Center chairman Ralph Davidson.   A partner in the Washington law firm of Hogan andamp; Hartson,Fulbright is a former chairman of the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee and was a vocal opponent of U.S. involvement in theVietnam War. His primary defeat in 1974 ended Fulbright's 30-yearSenate career.   Last Saturday in his Washington home, Fulbright married HarietMayor, 56, a longtime assistant and former executive director ofthe Fulbright Association of Fulbright Scholars alumni.   Fulbright's first wife, Betty, died in 1985. His bride is awidow with three children and one grandson.   The Fulbright bust was commissioned by the former senator's lawfirm and is on permanent loan to the Kennedy Center from theNational Portrait Gallery. It will be displayed outside the boxtier of the center's Opera House.</TEXT></DOC>
