The algorithmslabel the components of an sq 1 + N x sq 1 + N pixel image in O(longsq of N) time using a hypercube or shuffle-exchange computer with N processorsand a constant amount of memory per processor. The algorithms that arepresented are the first to solve this problem in O(log sq of N) time.The algorithms are based on a divide-and-conquer approach and use asa subroutine an O(log N) time PRAM algorithm for labeling the connectedcomponents of a graph. The simulation of the PRAM by the hypercube andshuffle-exchange computers is particularly efficient because the PRAMthat is being simulated has only O(N to the 3/4 power) processors andmemory cells.</TEXT></DOC>
