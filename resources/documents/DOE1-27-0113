The goal is arobust system that benefits from the strengths of several NLU methodologies,each applied where most appropriate. PAKTUS employs a frame-based knowledgerepresentation and associative networks throughout. The lexical componentuses morphological knowledge and word experts. Syntactic knowledge isrepresented in an Augmented Transition Network (ATN) grammar that incorporatesrule-based programming. Case grammar is used for canonical conceptualrepresentation with constraints. Domain-specific templates representknowledge about specific applications as patterns of the form used inlogic programming. Pragmatic knowledge may augment any of the other typesand is added wherever needed for a particular domain. The system hasbeen constructed in an interactive graphic programming environment. Ithas been used successfully to build a prototype front end for an expertsystem. This integration of existing technologies makes limited but practicalNLU feasible now for narrow, well-defined domains.</TEXT></DOC>
