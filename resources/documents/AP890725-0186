The emergency assistance was approved by President Bush at therequest of the International Committee for the Red Cross to providefood and medical supplies for victims of the country's 15-yearcivil war.   The United States is also providing $14 million worth of foodthrough voluntary organizations to feed about 400,000 Lebaneseaffected by the fighting, which is pitting Iraqi-backed Christiantroops against Syrian-backed Moslem and Druse militias.   Details of the U.S. aid were released by Assistant Secretary ofState for Middle Eastern affairs John Kelly to the HouseSubcommittee on Europe and the Middle East.   Kelly outlined the administration's Lebanon policy afterwitnesses from private Lebanese-American organizations describedacute shortages of food and fuel triggered by the civil war's worstround of fighting which began last March.   He denied contentions by some of the witnesses that U.S. foodsupplies were being diverted by Syrian troops who have mounted anaval blockade of Christian-controlled ports along theMediterranean coast, in retaliation for a Christian blockade ofMoslem-controlled ports.   In response to a question from the panel's chairman, Rep. LeeHamilton, D-Ind., whether the administration had considered anarmed naval escort of the supply ships, Kelly said:   ``I doubt very seriously that there would be much support in theCongress for the active involvement of U.S. warships in attemptingto break this blockade. I think this blockade can be eliminatedthrough persuasion and diplomacy.''   The thrust of U.S. policy is to lobby in the Arab world,including in communications with Syria and Iraq, for acceptance ofan Arab League initiative to bring about a ceasefire and a liftingof the blockades, Kelly said. The six-week effort has failed toyield results, he conceded.   ``We are waiting for an Arab League decision, an Arab Leagueaction. There is no U.S. initiative, there is no U.S. separateplan. These are the people who have a realistic chance of solvingthe problem there,'' Kelly said.</TEXT></DOC>
