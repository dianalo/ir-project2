 He is the author of the popular book &quot;TheCuckoo'sEgg,&quot; a more detailed account of his search for the intruder intodozens of U.S.andP;  computers processing military data.andM;CAN COMMENT: Upon being introduced, Cliff ran to the podium and beganthrowing things around.andP;  The delivery style he was using was somewherebetween frantic and frenzied.andP;  Once he got into his topic and forgot thenonsense, he is an excellent speaker.andP;  He is interesting, entertaining, andcan &quot;hold&quot; an audience.andP;  Too bad he occasionally reverts to his wild man act.andO;It isn't necessary.andM;Cliff was working at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory when he first noticedthat an unauthorized user had access to the system.andP;  Eventually, finding thatuser became his full time job -- and his obsession.andP;  He claims the thrill ofthe chase was his reward, not the eventualy capture of the culprit.andM;He gave advice to anyone who discovers a system intruder:andM;* disable his accessandM;* close up the security holeandM;* tell your system usersandM;* don't publicize it!andM;&quot;What we actually did was let the slob in, kept the hole open, monitoredeverything, traced things backward, and made noise trying to tell the rightpeople.&quot;andM;&quot;When you don't undestand something, do research!&quot;andP;  He suggested:andM;* apply scientific principlesandM;* keep a detailed notebookandM;- &quot;Write it down.andP;  Don't trust your memory.&quot;andM;* do your homeworkandM;- &quot;Do everything yourself, so you know what is going on.&quot;andM;* only trust proven conclusionsandM;- &quot;...  that will hold up in court.&quot;andM;* publish the resultsandM;* don't give up!andM;When the search began, &quot;We had zero budget, zero expertise, and zeromandate.&quot;andP;  Nobody had experience, nobody knew what to do, and almost nobodywas anxious to help.andM;What happened?andP;  Cliff Stoll:andM;* detected the intruder in August, 1986.andM;* monitored all his activities.andM;- printed out every keystroke.andM;* watched him attack 450 computers.andP;  (!)andM;- &quot;mostly containing U.S.andP;  military and defense data.&quot;andM;* traced the communications links back to Europe, to an individual inHanover, West Germany.andM;* contacted appropriate agencies.andM;- FBI, DOD, FCC, etc.andM;- &quot;None of them knew what to do!&quot;andM;* analyzed the intruder patterns, keywords, and targets.andM;Clif also analyzed the security of U.S.andP;  computers in general.andP;  He found thatout of every 20 installations, at least one is vulnerable to attack.andM;Cliff soon realized the intruder was not introducing a virus or wantonlydestroying data.andP;  The intruder was copying file.andP;  In the process, however, hewas stealing user IDs, stealing long-distance phone service, and occasionallychanging data to avoid detection.andM;The villain had an elaborate program -- using simple concepts -- thatcompared passwords to every word in the dictionary.andP;  If a standard Englishword was used, he would find the encrypted form the computer used -- he wouldhave the password.andP;  He also collected passwords and file names by readingelectronic mail.andP;  Cliff showed samples: one programmer would write to tellanother the &quot;new password&quot; for particular files.andM;Once in, the intruder would do a keyword search on words like &quot;NORAD.&quot;andP;  Theprograms he inserted to do the search were always written to duplicate the&quot;look-and-feel&quot; of the rest of the system bieng penetrated.andM;&quot;It was electronic terrorism!&quot;andM;Cliff showed a partial list of the compromised systems.andP;  All were dealingwith defense and should have been among the most secure in the country.andP;  Hesingled out two for special mention:andM;1.andP;  Unisys Corporation, Paoli, Pa.andM;- They are developing a &quot;secure communications system for the military&quot; --and the intruder was learning how it is being made secure.andM;2.andP;  MITRE Corporation, Washington, DCandM;- They insisted their system was impossible to penetrate.andP;  He got in.andP;  Theychanged their security procedures.andM;The intruder sometimes went through 7 different networks to get to histarget.andP;  His initial connection was to a Technical Library in Hanover.andP;  Hewould then have the Library computer connect to Tymnet -- and pay for theconnection -- in the U.S.andP;  Then he was off and running!andP;  Tymnet could connectto ARPANET which would connect to universities and on and on.andP;  Eventually, hewould be connected to his target.andM;Cliff traced him to the Library, but because of the type of telephone netused there, the local police needed a connect time of [is greater than] 2hours to trace the call.andM;Cliff built a bogus file.andP;  It was jammed full of information that looked real-- and enticing.andP;  There were letters and memos and lists and weaponspecifications and military base statistics and lots of interesting &quot;stuff&quot;.andO;It was a big file!andP;  It was made difficult to access.andP;  The bait worked!andP;  Theintruder copied the file -- for [is greater than] 2 hours.andM;The intruder was captured.andP;  An accomplice was found dead.andP;  A few weeks ago,the intruder was sentenced to 2 years &quot;and will probably be put onprobation.&quot;andM;One member of the audience asked: &quot;How do you know there isn't anotherintruder out there?&quot;andP;  Cliff: &quot;I don't give a damn!andP;  Finding the first one wasscience.andP;  From now on it will be engineering.&quot;andP;  (That went over big!)andM;Cliff got an ovation!andP;  It was, by far, the most interesting and entertainingpresentation of the conference.andP;  Thank you, Cliff stoll.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
