A general strike closed shops and schools throughout theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, in Arab east Jerusalem, and inArab villages in Israel.   In a rare clash inside Israel, police used tear gas to disperseArab demonstrators after an hour of stone throwing by youths in thetown of Taibeh, reporters said. Israel radio said two firebombswere also thrown.   One policeman was stabbed while arresting stone throwers. He washospitalized in stable condition. Six other officers were injuredby stones, the radio said. At least five Arabs were taken intocustody.   About 10,000 Israeli Arabs attended the main Land Day rally inArraba, where two people were killed during the 1976 riots.   In Jerusalem, Sheik Hamed Bitawi complained that Israelisoldiers and police prevented thousands of Moslems from attendingFriday prayer services at the Al Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam'sholiest sites.   ``We pray to God to avenge this wrong,'' Bitawi told the prayerservice. ``The Zionists have committed an injustice against us.Soldiers are here as if it is a battlefield.''   Extra police and soldiers were deployed to prevent unrestsurrounding the anniversary. During the 1976 riots, police shot todeath six Arabs who were protesting the seizing of Arab land in theGalilee.   This year's anniversary also fell on the first Friday _ theMoslem prayer day _ of the holy month of Ramadan, so officials wereparticularly concerned about unrest.   Fewer than 10,000 Moslems attended the Al Aqsa prayers. Beforethe start of the Palestinian uprising in December 1987, Ramadanservices would draw more than 150,000 people.   Young Palestinians were turned back at Israeli police and armycheckpoints on roads leading to Jerusalem. Troops also turnedpeople away as they tried to enter Jerusalem's old walled city togo to Al Aqsa.   An army statement said the soldiers were blocking ``elementslikely of endangering the security of the state.''   In protests in the occupied territories and Israel, Arabs stonedcars, held marches and raised Palestinian flags in defiance ofIsraeli authorities.   In the Arab town of Kafr Kanna, Abdel Wahab Daroushe, an Arabmember of Israel's Parliament, read a message from PLO ChairmanYasser Arafat to several thousand people at an annual memorialservice for a teen-ager killed in 1976.   Arafat's message praised Israeli Arabs ``for igniting the firstspark in 1976, which led to the great fire of the uprising.'' Italso praised Israelis who support negotiations with Palestinians as``heroic, democratic Jews.''   Palestinian protest marches were reported in the West Bank townsof Jenin, Beit Jala and Yatta.   Troops broke up the Yatta demonstration by dropping tear gasfrom helicopters. Soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets todisperse stone throwers in Beit Jala, Arab reports said.   In Jenin, hundreds of women and masked men marched carryingpictures of Arafat, Arab reporters said.   On walls in the town, Palestinians painted pictures of donkeyswith Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's name written underthem.   In a counter demonstration, Jewish settlers flew Israeli flagsin the West Bank to emphasize their demand that Israel not give upthe land captured in the 1967 Middle East war.   The flags were placed on a road leading from the Jewish suburbof Gilo on the outskirts of Jerusalem to the Dheishe refugee camp.The camp was established to house Palestinians who fled their homesat the founding of Israel in 1948.   Curfews were imposed on all 700,000 residents of the Gaza Stripand on four West Bank towns or villages.</TEXT></DOC>
