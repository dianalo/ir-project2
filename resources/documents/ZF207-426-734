Congress. House. Subcommittee on Human ResourcesRecruitmentGovernment Officials.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Ethics Law Will Breed Mediocrity, House Is ToldandM;Charging that post-government employment restrictions will force more topinformation resources management officials to resign and will makerecruitment nearly impossible, several former IRM officials recently urgedCongress to rescind the new procurement ethics law.andM;However, congressional sources said the law's sponsors still expect theregulations to take effect this month.andM;Testifying before the House Post Office and Civil Service Subcommittee onHuman Resources, Arthur P. Rosenblum and Leland Page said the new regulationslimiting post-government employment are confusing and unfair.andM;Rosenblum, former program executive officer for management informationsystems at the Army's Information Systems Engineering Command, and Page,former director of the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of AutomationService, retired early to avoid the restrictions.andP;  They warned that the lawwill prompt more managers with technical expertise to leave government.andM;They also said the law would not improve the federal procurement system butrather would create more problems at a time when agencies are struggling toattract and keep top technical talent.andM;&quot;The issue of post-[federal] employment is really the crux of what drove meand a number of my associates out and into a somewhat earlier retirement,&quot;Rosenblum said.andP;  &quot;These initiatives have missed the boat.andP;  It's a question ofwhether Congress has faith and trust in the federal service.&quot;andM;He urged the subcommittee to rescind the new restrictions, which are part ofa bill reauthorizing the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.andM;&quot;In this case the problem has not been defined, and we ought to leave italone.andP;  The 1978 laws have worked effectively,&quot; Page said.andM;&quot;The most serious threat to public confidence is not the ethics violators.andO;It is the predictable erosion in competence that will be the inevitableconsequence of continued low pay and restrictive legislation.&quot;andM;The regulations were scheduled to take effect May 16, but President Bushasked Congress to extend the deadline to July 16 so the Office of Managementand Budget could educate government employess about the changes.andM;The new ethics code prohibits federal procurement officials and contractorsfrom discussing post-government employment, offering or accepting gratuitiesor disclosing proprietary or source-selecting information during aprocurement.andM;Government employees also are barred for two years from accepting a job witha company working on the contracts in which they were involved.andP;  Penaltiesfor violating the rules include individual fines of up to $100,000 and fiveyears' imprisonment.andP;  Businesses are subject to fines of up to $1 million.andM;Many IRM and procurement managers have said the ethics regulations are aresponse to last summer's Pentagon procurement scandal.andM;But despite the publicity surrounding the &quot;Ill Wind&quot; investigation, membersof the President's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform said they found noevidence of any increase in improper behavior among procurement officials.andM;James Woolsey, a member of the reform committee, told the subcommittee theregulations are not based on sufficient evidence and make the government anunattractive employer.andP;  He said the employment restrictions are too vague onwhen a procurement begins and who is covered, and more laws will only createmore problems for an acquisition system that is under too much scrutiny.andM;&quot;A person is highly inclined to vote with his feet and never enter[government] to begin with, or leave before the statute takes effect,&quot;Woolsey said.andP;  We've ended up with a structure that, if you follow the rulesexactly, it gets worse.andP;  We have to do some simplifying.andP;  And a vehicle isneeded for scrubbing things like the OFPP amendments and making it as simpleand straightforward as possible.&quot;andM;Adding Insult To InjuryandM;Noel W. Hinners, former associate deputy administrator of NASA, saidregulation burdens are a major problem.andM;Subcommittee chairman Paul E. Kanjorski (D-Pa.), acknowledged that manypersonnel bottlenecks are caused by regulation.andP;  He said the new requirementscould turn out to be nothing more than &quot;a public relations scam.&quot;andM;Page and Hinners also called on Congress to raise federal salaries soagencies can recruit the best technical talent.andM;&quot;If the trend of the last 10 years continues, it is easy to predict that thegovernment work force is destined for mediocrity,&quot; Page said.andP;  &quot;In themid-'70s we could recruit from industry, but now that's impossible.andP;  Incollege we never get the A students.andP;  We get maybe the B and C-plusstudents.&quot;andM;&quot;We still attract good students, but we're losing them, and it's hard torecruit from industry,&quot; Hinners said.andP;  &quot;This is a real problem which is notgoing to be evidenced by looking solely at statistics of attrition andhiring.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
