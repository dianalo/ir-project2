One-third of the teachers were laid off. More than 40students have been jammed into some classrooms, up from anaverage of 25 a year ago. Students often share textbooks.   Middle-school children can't take art, music and physicaleducation any more. They can't take industrial arts, homeeconomics or languages. Middle- and elementary-schoolchildren don't have guidance counselors. Except in the highschool, there aren't any librarians. The system stoppedfunding all athletic teams. Athletes must pay $100 to play,and booster clubs scrounge for money.</LP><TEXT>   But the majority of Holyoke's voters don't seem to care.Twice in six months they have rejected tax increases for theschools even as they approved increases for the police andfire departments and for the senior citizen center. They evenvoted to raise taxes for trash collection rather than chargehomeowners a fee.   Some voters are angry at school administrators theyconsider uncommunicative and wasteful. Others are burdened bytaxes and disgusted with modern education. But interviewswith a number of Holyoke residents also indicate a morefundamental problem: The town's mostly white, working-classvoters, many aged and childless, are alienated from itsmainly Puerto Rican public-school children.   &quot;There's a backlash against minorities. I don't think it'sfair to put the burden of educating anybody on the propertyowners,&quot; says Frederick Hampson, a 65-year-old semi-retiredplating plant operator, who thinks education should be fundedat the state or federal level. He says he voted &quot;my selfinterest&quot;: for police, fire and trash pickup, and againstschool taxes.   Futurists sometimes speculate on the likelihood of U.S.society being rent by intergenerational conflicts, first overwho pays for schooling, later over paying for SocialSecurity. In Holyoke -- an aged industrial city of 42,000people, the birthplace of volleyball and Lestoil -- thefuture may have arrived, and it isn't pretty. Services forolder people get funded. Those for children, such as parksand recreation programs, the library and the schools, don't.   &quot;Instinctively, one generation has always provided for thenext generation; here, suddenly, there's a break in that,&quot;says John Clark, a veteran school principal. &quot;They're saying,`We don't care that these people may be supporting us in thenursing homes.'&quot;   In Holyoke, a complex of issues combined to feed anger atthe schools. The state cut back funding, placing more burdenon local taxpayers. School administrators stubbornlymaintained special programs for poverty-stricken anddisruptive students while cutting back programs for themajority of children. The superintendent and his deputycriticized voters for being cheap. The school board appearedto ignore demands for spending cuts. And the studentsconsistently scored near the bottom on state basic skillstests.   Michael Donohue, a retired municipal court judge whopublishes a bimonthly newspaper called Hello Holyoke, says,&quot;It wasn't a vote against the children. We just want theadministration to be accountable.&quot; He contends theadministration doesn't fully disclose finances and doesn'tteach what's needed. &quot;We have to get back and teach basicthings such as respect for people and property.&quot;   So, when the state cut back its funding of the city,recession-strapped voters were in no mood to pony up moretaxes. The school system's fiscal 1992 budget was cut 17% to$24 million from $29 million in the prior year. And the citystuck the schools with $2.6 million in new fuel andmaintenance costs to boot.   After the most recent vote, about 500 Holyoke High Schoolstudents walked out of class and marched to city hall toprotest the schools' condition. The mayor refused to meetwith them; they were briefly suspended from school.   Of course, school systems nationally are complainingthey're short of funds. And taxpayers everywhere rebel athigher taxes. But the problems in Holyoke are unusual becausethe effects of the cutbacks in the schools are so Draconian,because Holyoke's tax burden has been mild compared with manyMassachusetts cities and because what's happening here seems,to some, like a rending of America's political compact.&quot;Isn't there an unspoken promise that I will give to otherpeople's kids what other people gave to me?&quot; asks GeorgeCounter, school superintendent, a Holyoke native and graduateof its public schools, whose father worked in the city'sonce-thriving paper mills.   Despite its small size, Holyoke has many of thecharacteristics of a large urban school system. As many as80% of elementary-school students are eligible for freelunches. About a third of city residents, but almost 70% ofthe 6,700 students in the public school system, are Hispanic,almost all from Puerto Rico. The dropout rate is about 30%,the administration says. Drugs are a big problem in the city.   But in the past, Holyoke has generally been given an A foreffort. It has dropout prevention programs, special schoolsfor rowdy students and a knack for grantsmanship that hasresulted in several new schools and extensive computer labs.&quot;Five years ago, the state department of education wassending people here to see a model urban school system,&quot; saysMr. Clark, the principal. Last year top graduates, manyminorities, went to Yale, MIT and Brown.   The best-selling book &quot;Among Schoolchildren,&quot; by TracyKidder, detailed a year in one Holyoke elementary-schoolclassroom. Today, Chris Zajac, the teacher it featured, says:&quot;If Tracy came to me this year, I wouldn't do it. It wouldn'tbe a picture of good education.&quot;   During the 1980s, state funds paid over half of Holyoke'smunicipal costs. Ho'yokers, as they call themselves, paidproperty taxes 6.5% less than the state average based onassessed value, and well under the level of neighboringcities. But when the state started cutting funding last year,the city was forced to ask voters to vote for higher propertytaxes.   In Holyoke, property taxes on the average $100,000 homewere just $900 last year. The voter-approved tax increaseswill boost average tax bills by $275, says Brian Smith, cityauditor. The defeated schools proposals would have addedanother $197, resulting in a 52% overall tax increase. Voterssaid no, 57% to 43%. With taxes now above state averages, Mr.Smith predicts, &quot;It will be another generation before peoplewill vote to raise taxes again.&quot;   Nevertheless, many observers had expected school taxapproval in the November vote because the school cuts were sovisible. Since September, some classes violate state andfederal laws. One bilingual class has 40 students and oneteacher; state law mandates a teacher's aide when the classsize exceeds 18. A high-school science class has 45 students,with seven of them perched on stools in the back becausethere aren't enough chairs. The sole high-school Frenchteacher maintains a fourth-year French class only by teachingit simultaneously with the third-year class.   Because two elementary schools were closed, SullivanSchool now has 700 students and 20 teachers, up from 420students and 18 teachers last year. Among other things, thatmeans that students must gobble lunch in 20 minutes -- 10less than last year -- so everyone gets a chance to eat.   Kimberly O'Connor, a sophomore at Holyoke High School,says &quot;there aren't enough books to go around&quot; in the expandedclasses, forcing students to share them. In the largeclasses, &quot;it's really hard for concentrating. Sometimes theteacher has no control.&quot;   Sigberto Lorenzo, a senior who organized the studentprotest, says he was disappointed by the elimination of aplay-writing course he had looked forward to. &quot;Small classeslike that give you the edge you need to hack it in college,&quot;he says. And fees for sports mean &quot;a lot fewer minoritiestried out for the football team.&quot;   t Lynch Middle School, 26 of 54 staffers are gone. Art,music, home economics and physical education teachers aregone. So is the guidance counselor, the vice principal andone of four custodians. &quot;It's like the Titanic hit theiceberg,&quot; says David DuPont, the principal.   Although base salary for a teacher is $20,000, virtuallyall are senior teachers making about $35,000 a year. Many arehandling courses they never taught before. James Ripa, arevered high-school history teacher, ended up in amiddle-school social studies program in which the studentscan't do homework because there aren't enough of the14-year-old textbooks to go around. He tried assigning themto look up words in the dictionary, but found many didn'thave a dictionary at home.   Despite a spate of publicity about the problems, votersremained unmoved. &quot;I'm sorry to see my nieces and nephewhurt,&quot; says Melody McGinty, &quot;but the people in charge need toget a message.&quot;   Edward Shea, a childless security supervisor who opposedthe schools tax increase, says the system hasn't responded tothe taxpayers' problems. &quot;Teachers want more money, they wantthe laid-off teachers brought back. The teachers have toreally accept the changes.&quot; And he says, as the economyexpanded in the 1980s, &quot;the Latinos were able to get a lotmore. Now they have to cut back.&quot;   Many senior citizens, who make up 23% of the registeredvoters, have trouble coping with increases in their propertytaxes. Joseph Ely, 65, who is retired with a disabilitypension from Social Security, lives in one of Holyoke'sfinest neighborhoods in a house assessed at $230,000 that hecouldn't sell for $150,000 two years ago when he tried. Heand his wife receive $864 a month in Social Securitypayments. &quot;You can't live on that,&quot; he says. &quot;They'recharging me $1,800 a year for taxes.&quot;   Geraldine Barrett, a 56-year-old single woman who votedagainst the school tax, complains that as a secretary in astate agency, she hasn't gotten a raise in three years. &quot;InHolyoke it seems like 30% of the people are elderly and 25%are on welfare; then the rest of the people are trying topick up the difference,&quot; she says. And with Holyoke schoolsnear the bottom of state rankings in basic skills tests, shesays, &quot;people feel like they're throwing money into a blackhole.&quot;   Mr. Hampson, the plating-plant operator, says financingeducation for Holyoke's Puerto Rican population requires &quot;amuch broader approach than hitting people who own homes inHolyoke. As a Holyoke taxpayer, it's not my problem. It's aproblem for the federal government. They're the ones whooversee the island of Puerto Rico.&quot;   The school board and administrators made it easy forvoters to be cynical. Two years ago, in a move to bolster adowntown construction plan, the system moved itsadministrative offices to fancier quarters at an added costof $150,000 a year. In September, the school board, at anemotional meeting, voted to rehire all 225 laidoff teachers,even though the system didn't have any money. Mayor WilliamA. Hamilton, who is also chairman of the school board,refused to appropriate funds. &quot;The voters thought they were abunch of hockey pucks,&quot; he grouses. Indeed, five of the sixincumbent school board members who faced opposition weredefeated at the same time the tax increases were turned down.   Mayor Hamilton analyzes the tax vote this way: &quot;There hasbeen a lot of white flight to parochial and private schools.People without children in schools have less commitment tothem. The elderly vote in wonderful percentages and the voteof younger people isn't as evident.&quot;   Then the mayor adds: &quot;I'm anxious that this town not beidentified as the town that preferred trash to kids.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
