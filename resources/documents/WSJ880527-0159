Klein </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   Usually, I have little trouble ignoring the Indianapolis 500-mile automobile race, but this year I've read a couple of things I thought were worthy of comment as the Sunday-before-Memorial Day event approaches.    The first was one of those &quot;special advertising sections&quot; that seem to be stapled into every issue of Sports Illustrated magazine these days. This one ran on May 9 and was titled &quot;Indy.&quot; It covered 14 pages, eight of which were full-page ads for some of the products that like to hitch themselves to auto racing's ample star.    The text was by Patrick Bedard, who has driven in a couple of 500s. It was about the evolution of the engines that contest the 77-year-old go-around, and its tone was both upbeat and lyrical. &quot;An Indy car at full song is a vivid symbol of the thoroughly optimistic and exquisitely cockeyed spirit of man,&quot; Bedard wrote. Nowhere in the piece do the words &quot;crash,&quot; &quot;injury,&quot; &quot;death&quot; or, even, &quot;safety&quot; appear.    The other work was the 1988 edition of the &quot;500-Mile Race Record Book,&quot; published annually by the Indianapolis News. It's a pocket-sized book that the newspaper sells for $2.61 at its offices, or $3.80 by mail. It lists the order of finish and highlights of each of the 71 500s that have been run on the Indianapolis Speedway to date, as well as of those of the other U.S. 500-mile events for Indy-style cars. It also lists the individual annual finishes of the nearly 600 present and former drivers who have piloted vehicles around the one-time &quot;Brickyard,&quot; and, where appropriate, the dates and manner of their deaths.    The book has no literary content, much less style, but it speaks more eloquently of the reality of the Indy 500 than do the well-crafted words of the SI supplement. In the sparest language, cars are depicted spinning and hitting walls, burning and coming apart. People get hurt. People die. If the race was a movie, it would be rated &quot;X,&quot; for violence.    Of the 1981 running, for instance, we learn:   &quot;Lap 33 -- {Don} Whittington hit wall in backstretch.    &quot;Lap 58 -- {Rick} Mears pitted while leading, caught fire. Mears and six crewmen suffered burns.    &quot;Lap 64 -- {Danny} Ongais hit wall at Turn 3, suffered fractured leg, internal injuries as car disintegrated.&quot;    Oh, yes. Bobby Unser won in 3 hours, 35 minutes and 41.78 seconds, averaging 139.029 miles per hour in a &quot;Norton Spirit&quot; car.    Information of a different sort comes from leafing between the race results in the front of the book and the driver histories in the back, and toting up a few scores. This process reveals race-car driving to be a pursuit of unsurpassed danger. Of the 492 former Indy drivers listed -- some of whom appeared at the Speedway only once -- 130, or better than one in four, came to their deaths in races or through race-related injuries.    Furthermore, superior driving skill seems to involve either greater danger or recklessness. Of the 35 deceased winners of U.S. auto racing's premier event, 14, or 40%, died on the tracks. These include five of the last six decedents: Mark Donohue (the 1972 winner), Jimmy Clark (1965), Jimmy Bryan (1958), Bob Sweikert (1955) and Bill Vukovich (1953 and '54). The sixth, 1966-winner Graham Hill, was killed in the 1975 crash of a plane he was piloting.    Of the 71 fields that have started the Indy 500, the 1955 one was the the most ill-starred: 16 of its 33 members, including seven of the top eight finishers, wound up being carried off on their shields.    Four of those deaths came on the Speedway. Two-time winner Vukovich died in a smash-up on Lap 56 in the race itself. Second-placer Tony Bettenhausen was killed in a 1961 practice run. Pat O'Connor, who finished eighth, was a casualty of the 1958 race, and 20th-place Keith Andrews died in practice in 1957. The Class of '55, incidentally, fared even worse than those figures indicate, because Manuel Ayuho was killed during practice for that run.    The Indianapolis News book indicates that race-driver safety has improved in recent years; since 1973, only one has been killed on the Speedway, compared with 36 in the years before. He was Gordon Smiley, who died during qualifying runs in 1982. Race officials say that better materials get most of the credit, along with the fairly recent practice of building cars so that they come apart on impact, dispersing the energy of the crash and lessening the injury risk to drivers.    But the injury beat goes on, so maybe luck also is involved. In practice runs for last year's 500, for example, crashes resulted in a broken neck and foot for Dennis Firestone, a broken heel and ankle for Johnny Parsons, and two broken ankles and a broken leg for Jim Crawford. Roberto Guerrero spent 17 days in a coma with head injuries suffered last September in a tire-testing run on the Speedway.    It is possible to disagree on what conclusions are to be drawn from the above. Racing's supporters point out, properly, that the drivers are consenting adults who know the risks of their activity. Some of these aficionados are fond of contrasting their sport, favorably, with boxing, where the contestants intend to harm one another.    I regard the difference between auto racing and boxing as one of degree, not kind, with auto racing getting the worst of the comparison. In addition, I fail to see in auto racing the man-against-man drama that sports should generate. Too much metal and too many corporate stickers get in the way.    Most distressing to me is auto racing's tendency to involve innocents, i.e., spectators, in its mayhem. The total Indy 500 death toll of 62 includes not only drivers, but also mechanics, track personnel and spectators. The latest of 10 spectator deaths occured last year. As the &quot;500-Mile Race Record Book&quot; describes it:   &quot;Lap 131 -- Bettenhausen lost wheel in Turn 3; wheel hit by Guerrero bounced into stands with fatal injury to Lyle Kurtenbach, 41, Rothschild, Wis.&quot;    Mr. Kurtenbach, a salesman, was survived by his wife, Karen, and daughter, Dawn. </TEXT></DOC>
