Wave energy conversion efficiency is high. Lessreduction of efficiency against both the wave from the oblique directionor the tidal ebb and flow. For a rough weather, the entire unit can bejacked-up for better stability, wave resistance, durability, and maintenance.(57 figs, 3 tabs, 14 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
