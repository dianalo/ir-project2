Overall, consumer prices should increase by 4.5 percent to 5percent for the entire year, compared with a 1987 increase of below4 percent, the forecast said.   The Labor Department has reported that inflation ran at anannual rate of 4.4 percent from January through May.   Since 1983, inflation has risen at an annual rate of between 3percent and 4 percent.   David Blitzer, the chief economist at Standard andamp; Poor's, saidthe weaker dollar has pushed up prices of imported goods, whilefood prices are up because of the Midwestern drought.   In addition, Blitzer said, ``Rising industrial production andhigher capacity utilization are causing some manufacturingindustries to charge more.''   The economist said he does not expect prices to soar this yearbecause the Federal Reserve will move to rein in inflation. But ifcurrent trends continue, prices could rise by 5 percent in 1989, hesaid.   The drought will force food prices to rise at a faster pace thanthe general inflation rate as soaring futures prices force the costof poultry, bread, pasta and cereals higher, Standard andamp; Poor'spredicted. But competition among producers for other productsshould help keep food prices to a 5 percent to 6 percent overallincrease, the forecast said.   Clothing prices are expected to rise as much as 7 percentbecause of higher prices for imported apparel and increased costsfor wool and synthetic material, Standard andamp; Poor's said.   Prices for domestic cars are expected to remain at currentlevels through the end of the year, Standard andamp; Poor's said.Competition from foreign automakers will help keep increases belowthe rate of inflation.   Homeowners should find their natural gas bills will rise about 2percent, while the cost of electricity will decline because oflower corporate tax rates.   Oil prices are expected to remain at current levels, whichshould translate to lower gasoline prices, the forecast said.   Standard andamp; Poor's also predicted liquor prices would remainstable unless taxes are increased. But rising wholesale prices anda possible federal tax increase for cigarettes could drive theircost up as much as 15 percent.   The cost of taking a vacation is expected to continue to soarfollowing a 9 percent increase in air fares during the firstquarter. Hotel room prices are expected to be up between 4 percentand 5 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
