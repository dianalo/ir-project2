Do IRS examiners primp before an audit? Maybe not. But they are told to &quot;dress for success,&quot; because taxpayers may judge their fairness, sincerity, and competence by appearances. &quot;Most people have a visual concept of a person who is professionally competent. You will find it a distinct help . . . if you know and look as if you know what you are doing,&quot; says a new manual for estate-return auditors. &quot;Your attire should be in keeping with your job. . . . You should look business-like and appear neat.&quot;    Correct and clear speech is a standard, too. &quot;Take every opportunity&quot; to improve vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar, and voice, the manual directs: &quot;Your . . . voice is often the measure of your self-control.&quot; Never display anger or discourtesy. &quot;If you will maintain an attitude of sincerity and objectivity, your voice will reflect your courtesy and competence.&quot;    &quot;A certain amount of mental psych&quot; is needed to build confidence before an audit, so an auditor should know the return and the issues.    ESTATE-TAX RETURNS get close IRS scrutiny for certain gimmicks.    The new audit manual lists several ways in which estates and heirs may try to finagle lower estate tax. Heirs' claims against an estate may be efforts to avoid the tax; they even may hide the fact that debts already were paid. Auditors should make sure that heirs report as income any payments received for services to the decedent. Tax-free bequests to charity or the spouse may be subject to obscure contingencies. Claimants to property in the decedent's safe deposit box must prove they own it.    Use of the word &quot;discount&quot; to explain an asset valuation is &quot;a signal for careful scrutiny&quot; of the value; if the estate got more than one appraisal, the auditor should see them all. The decedent may have kept a taxable interest in property that was transferred before death &quot;without adequate consideration.&quot; A fractional interest in an asset may show that the decedent made unreported gifts. Property that a decedent inherited should be traced, the manual says.    HERE'S ONE MORE WAY to undermine a home-mortgage deduction.    A couple we'll call the Fields bought the vacant lot next door and are building a larger home on it; they will move in soon. But they had trouble borrowing on their present home and the lot to finance construction, so they got a $32,000 second mortgage on their rental property in another town -- a house they have never used as a home. Then they asked the IRS if the interest is fully deductible mortgage interest.    They get the bad news in IRS private ruling 8803018: To be deducted as residence interest, the cost must stem from debt on the Fields' first or second home. But their loan is secured by rental property, not their residence. That makes the expense personal interest, for which deductions are being phased out, says Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton. This year, only 40% of personal-interest costs is deductible.    The interest can't be charged against rental income, because of the way the loan was used, Willens notes.    A WOLF IN SHEEPSKIN? Alton Daniel Watson of Glendale, Ore., said his profitable fur-trading sideline was a hobby (more often, taxpayers claim a loss-ridden hobby is a business). But the Tax Court ruled it was a business and upheld civil fraud penalties for concealing the income.    STATE TRANSFER TAXES on sales of stocks and bonds in 1987 may be subtracted from the capital-gain proceeds. But if your tax rate on ordinary income exceeds the 28% top capital-gain rate, notes publisher Prentice Hall, you may do better to take transfer taxes as an itemized deduction.    LAW BARRING DISCLOSURE of tax-return data doesn't preclude the IRS from employing First National Bank of Chicago to process estimated-tax returns, said the seventh-circuit appeals court. It upheld a lower court's dismissal of a suit brought by some Illinois residents.    THE FLAT 34% TAX catches many personal-service corporations unaware.    Owners of small ones may think their accounting method lets them off the hook, but 1987's tax act repeals graduated rates for all such concerns in 1988. No more do they pay 15% on taxable income up to $50,000 and then 25% on income up to $75,000. The flat rate hits concerns owned by employees, retired employees, or their estates and that perform services in health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting.    The new law applies to corporations that qualify, under a past dispensation, to use the cash method of accounting for income as received and costs as paid. Thus, says Howard A. Levenson of Ernst andamp; Whinney, CPAs, many owners of concerns accounting for items as accrued believe mistakenly that they continue to be taxed at graduated rates. In fact, the 34% flat rate now applies to both cash-method and accrual-method companies.    The new rule is taking many personal-service corporations by surprise, Levenson says.    BRIEFS: The IRS plans a hearing March 1 on proposed rules for allocating individual interest costs among various new categories. . . . A House Ways and Means panel plans hearings March 2 and 3 on tax incentives for low-income housing. . . . Negotiators for the U.S. and France are to meet about March 7 to update the income-tax treaty between the two. </TEXT></DOC>
