Oppenheimer-Palmieri, a Delaware limited partnership, earlier this month joined Entertainment Marketing Inc., a Houston electronics wholesaler, in preparing a proxy contest for control of the Edison, N.J., consumer electronics retailer.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the fund said it paid $3.6 million, or $4.54 a share, including commissions, for 800,000 shares last Monday. That brought its total investment in Crazy Eddie to more than $11 million. The fund said it intends to acquire control of Crazy Eddie either by itself or with others.    The fund now is Crazy Eddie's biggest known holder. Entertainment Marketing and its president, Elias Zinn, together own nearly two million shares, or 6.4%. This includes 240,000 shares acquired last week by Mr. Zinn, increasing his holding to 340,000. Crazy Eddie Chairman Eddie Antar recently reduced his stake to 1.5 million shares, or 5.7%. Crazy Eddie has nearly 31 million shares outstanding.    Principals in Oppenheimer-Palmieri Fund are Victor Palmieri, a specialist in corporate turnarounds, and Oppenheimer andamp; Co., a New York investment firm.    Crazy Eddie shares closed at $4.75, up 25 cents, in national over-the-counter trading Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
