They consider here the geneticaspects of diseases that are exemplars for the two major groups, theorgan-specific thyroiditis-associated group and the non-organic-specificmultisystem lupus-associated group, recognizing that there is a spectrumfrom organ-specific to non-organ-specific autoimmunity.</TEXT></DOC>
