The American Psychiatric Association masses here onMother's Day weekend with a bit of guilt. It's the fifth yearin a row that the weighty annual meeting falls on thematernal holiday and the 10th such clash in the past 22years.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There have been questions raised,&quot; concedes MelvinSabshin, APA medical director. Complaints began in earnestaround 1985, when the group got its first woman president.But &quot;it isn't easy to accommodate&quot; 16,000 people, says Dr.Sabshin. Bookings are made years in advance; few cities canhandle such a big group; May is tough -- too early and theweather's nasty, too late and members complain about missingfamily graduations.   &quot;I've often wondered why they don't examine theircollective psyche on this,&quot; says the wife of a Midwestpsychiatrist. (She prefers anonymity, noting, &quot;I've kept mypeace this long.&quot;) Her husband is retiring after 40 years,and she'll be with him in New York this weekend. But, &quot;I'mupset we're not going to be home to celebrate with ourchildren and grandchildren.&quot;   And well she should be, asserts Dorothy W. Cantor, apsychologist in Westfield, N.J. &quot;There's something sacredabout Mother's Day and Father's Day,&quot; says Ms. Cantor, whohas a general practice and has written about women's andfamily concerns. From a clinical standpoint, too, Mother'sDay &quot;is a big deal,&quot; she says.   The holiday can exacerbate any problems between mother andchild, says Ms. Cantor. She adds that some of her ownpatients are &quot;going through terrible things.&quot; The mainpsychologists' group, the American Psychological Association,steers clear of major holidays, holding its annual meeting inthe summer.   But the psychiatrists are working their problem through.Next year, they'll meet on Mother's Day in New Orleans. Butin 1992, 1993 and 1994, the session will be on other weekendsin May.   As in corporate life, much of the change regarding womencomes from women themselves reaching positions of authority.&quot;The more you're in a position of leadership, the more whatyou say gets attended to,&quot; says Elissa Benedek,president-elect of the APA. She says all four of her childrenare along for this year's meeting, although that hasn'talways been possible.   &quot;I think it's very likely we'll not be scheduling any moremeetings on Mother's Day in the future,&quot; says Dr. Benedek.</TEXT></DOC>
