DavidAnderson, former U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia (1981-85) andcurrently director of the Aspen Institute in Berlin, offers adiplomat's view in a letter to his daughter, Natalie.Excerpts follow:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   You ask what has happened. Several unfortunate, sad andeven tragic developments. Tito died in 1980, 10 years toolate to leave behind a functioning governmental structure. Heprepared no successors. In fact, the Serbian and Croatianliberals whose heads he figuratively lopped off in 1971-72were Yugoslavia's last, best hope for a more democratic, lessdogmatic system of governance. With their disappearance, thecountry was basically lost to the old guard of formerpartisans and Communist Party apparatchiks. The problem formost observers, myself included, is that we did not recognizethe enormous damage that Tito had done. With his internalmachinations, he left Serbia weaker, Croatia not much better,and so set the stage for events 20 years later. He compoundedthe failure by drawing up a constitution in 1974 thateffectively returned power to the republics -- principally tokeep the Serbs from dominating the others. But as hedistributed power to the republican fiefdoms, he did notdemand a consequent responsibility for use of this new power.Thus, there was no constitutional glue to hold the countrytogether when he left the scene. The economy was Tito's othermajor mistake. Yugoslavia's foreign debt in the mid- and late1970s was allowed to accumulate in an uncoordinated anduncontrolled manner. The result was that by 1979-80, thecountry was near bankruptcy. Western assistance helped solvethe problem temporarily up to 1986 or thereabouts, butYugoslavia's lack of financial and investment disciplinere-entered the scene so that by 1988 the country's economictribulations were catastrophic -- including an inflation rateof some 2,500% in early 1989. It is almost back at that levelnow. The foreign debt problem also expanded so that, today,Yugoslavia owes creditors more than $15 billion. You will askif Tito alone or even the Communist ideology he preached wasresponsible for today's breakup of the multinational state. Iam of the view that Tito and his variation of communism werenot especially important in the larger order of things in theland of the South Slavs. Certainly, by much finagling he keptthe country together. Surely, the ideology gave a rationalefor various schemes and plans, most of them misbegotten. Butthe problem, I fear, is the Yugoslavs themselves. They are aperverse group of folks, near tribal in their behavior,suspicious of each other (with usually sound reasons),friendly on the outside but very cynical within, ever readyfor a war or a battle, proud of their warrior history, andcompletely incapable of coming to grips with the modernworld. To go wandering in Yugoslavia, long before the currentcivil war, was an adventure. As you will recall, we alwaysmet strange people who seemed caught up in some time-warp. Ienjoyed the sensation of stepping back in history, for I amsomething of a romantic. But I could afford my romanticism(except when I was a serious ambassador]): the Yugoslavleaders could not. When confronted by nasty facts of everydaylife -- e.g. International Monetary Fund conditionality forloans -- they would hark back to the glorious Partisan daysand threaten to go off to the woods and eat leaves beforebowing to the horrible American-dominated (in their view)international financial institution. So here we are in 1992and Yugoslavia unravels as I write. The winter will end, thecease-fire will lapse, the civil war will begin again -- andthis time, Bosnia and Macedonia will be involved. The Croatsand Slovenes knew they set out on a dangerous course whenthey first pressed for independence. The Croats, inparticular, were well aware that the 600,000 Serbs in Croatiawould not be left unprotected by the Serbian authorities inBelgrade. And, indeed, the Serbs reacted predictably. One maydebate whether the Croats were provocative at the outset andthe Serbs overdid things with their violent response. Whetherthe Serbs were intent on creating a Greater Serbia atCroatian expense is open to question. That so many peopledied and suffered, that so many villages, towns and citieswere devastated -- that is not open to question. It allhappened. The bombing of cities by the Serbs who well knewthat no Serbian residents required protection (Osijek,Dubrovnik, Zadar) was, in the purest sense of the word,immoral. So, I would say, a plague on both houses. But thatis not enough. I ask myself whether these republics, whichhad coexisted for so many decades in peace and evenfriendship, can resume the personal relationships and trustof earlier years. I conclude that they simply cannot. That isthe ultimate tragedy.   Those who brought about the evil in the old land of theSouth Slavs will go to their graves knowing that they, andthey alone, not only ordered killing and devastation in theirown land; they also put an end to the messy and untidystructure that once was Yugoslavia. They have left behind apopulation that will be as divided and hostile as anythingthat characterized the Balkans for several hundred years. Myold Scottish mother, who understands tribal antagonisms aswell as I understand Yugoslavia, would say of these Yugoslav&quot;leaders&quot;: &quot;Bad sest to them.&quot; I can only echo this curse.With Yugoslavia's having dissolved into a series ofmini-states, you will ask -- what now? Chaos, disaster orsimple economic ruin, I reply. None of these states, not evensupposedly prosperous Slovenia, is productive enough on alarge enough scale to make a modern state function. Each willslide backward. Yugoslavia was never an economic successstory, but it always managed to muddle through. Now, most ofthe country is finding it difficult to do much more thansubsist. And there then comes the self-delusion of eachmini-state concerning its place in the world. All wantinstant international recognition, in part for reasons ofpride, in part out of the expectation of aid, credits, trade,membership in the World Bank and IMF (not to mention theU.N.). They also all expect to be able finally to buyweaponry so that they can fight the next phase of the civilwar on a more even footing -- i.e., with more sophisticatedweapons. And, finally, several of them are beset by illusionsthat the West will act in decisive fashion to end theviolence. For example, the Slovenes and Croats talk readilyof the U.S. Sixth Fleet moving aggressively into the Adriaticto sink any ships that bombard coastal cities. Arms andammunition will be dropped by friendly Western aircraft tocommunities besieged by hostilities. And no Serbian warplaneswill be allowed to overfly other republics because the &quot;West&quot;(the U.S.) will monitor overflights and send up sorties toforce the Serbian aircraft to back down. What of the role ofthe West, if any, in this unholy mess? I would like to thinkthat the U.N., the European Community, the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the Western EuropeanUnion, the U.S., Germany, France or a combination of severalWestern states could come up with a way to manage or at leastcontrol the conflict in what used to be Yugoslavia. But noWestern soldier is going to be sent to die over a Serb-Croatconflict. The U.N. forces will withdraw when the shootingstarts again. The EC and CSCE will not become militarilyinvolved. The U.S. hopes that the whole dirty business willgo away. The Germans may send some money to Slovenia andCroatia, but very little; and any more active involvement isout of the question. As one German commentator put it, wewill simply have to wait until all sides have exhaustedthemselves (i.e., killed themselves off) and then we will tryto help the survivors. So much for modern diplomatic methods.That is the story as I see it. It need never have happened.What was required was wiser leadership in all of therepublics of Yugoslavia; less emotion and more common sense;better diplomacy by a disinterested Western Europe and U.S.;and a readiness by the Yugoslavs generally to see the modernworld as it is. But there was none to be found. That is areason to be sad when you contemplate this land where once,for a few years, you made your home -- and which I onceconsidered part of me.
