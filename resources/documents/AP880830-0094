William Burns, head of the U.S. Arms Control and DisarmamentAgency, also reiterated the U.S. commitment to the Reaganadministration's space-based missile defense program.   The Soviets maintain that some research of the program, knownofficially as the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly called``Star Wars,'' violates the ABM treaty.   In a speech to the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament, hisfirst public comment since the treaty review conference began Aug.24, Burns referred only briefly to the dispute and did not breakany new ground.   He said the United States believes the Krasnoyarsk radar ``is asignificant violation of a central element of this treaty, and thatmeasures must be taken to resolve this serious problem.''   The United States maintains the radar violates the 1972 treatybecause it is not located on the periphery of the country, facingoutward, as the treaty stipulates that missile-tracking radars mustbe.   The ABM treaty restricts each side to deploying only one ABMsystem, comprising a radar and anti-ballistic missiles. The aim isto prevent either side from creating a full nationwide protectivenetwork, under the theory that neither side would launch a nuclearattack if it feared devastating retaliation.   The two sides are holding their third review conference inGeneva. Under the treaty, such a review must be held every fiveyears to allow both sides to air their grievances.   The Soviet Union has charged that some ``Star Wars'' researchviolates the ABM treaty, though it has not made clear in publicstatements where it draws the line.   Burns said the proposed system is not a bargaining chip. ``Wewill research it, test it, and, if it works, deploy it,'' he said.   In his wide-ranging speech, Burns also warned about the dangersof the nuclear weapons proliferation.   ``It is indeed ironic that just when the two major nuclearweapon states have agreed to destroy their intermediate rangenuclear forces, similar weapons systems appear to be spreading toother regions of the world,'' he said. The spread ``will onlycreate new'' security problems, he said.   Burns also said the upcoming U.S. presidential election wouldnot affect the U.S. commitment to the search for a comprehensiveban on chemical weapons, saying it is ``an enduring, bipartisancommitment.''   The Disarmament Conference has been trying to negotiate such aban for about 19 years.</TEXT></DOC>
