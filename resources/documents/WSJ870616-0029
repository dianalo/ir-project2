The agency said it gave the Rosemead, Calif.-based utility two years from next Jan. 1 to recoup the money, plus interest.    The decision will probably mean higher rates, said Mary McKenzie, an adviser to Stanley Hulett, the commission's president.    A specific rate rise wasn't set, and a utility spokesman said any rate increase might be offset by rate reductions reflecting other factors.    In May 1985, Edison agreed to pay San Francisco-based Chevron Corp. $350 million to settle Chevron's 1982 civil suit, which had accused the utility of breach of contract for terminating its oil purchases during a 10-year agreement between the two companies. </TEXT></DOC>
