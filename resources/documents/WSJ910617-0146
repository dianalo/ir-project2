The Turkish government claims that Loral has failed totransfer certain technology and fulfill its obligations totrain personnel as called for in the contract to produce theALQ-178 electronic countermeasures for F-16 aircraft. Thegovernment said it would cancel the contract for default ifLoral didn't respond by today.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We are responding and I am quite confident we willresolve the issues,&quot; Loral Chairman Bernard L. Schwartz saidFriday, explaining that technology transfer has been delayedbecause of the U.S. government approvals required. &quot;Whateverwe do with respect to that comes under the auspices of theU.S. Air Force. We cannot go beyond the license of the U.S.Air Force.&quot;   If Turkey does cancel the contract, Loral said it could beforced to repay up to $94 million that it has received sincelast year, when the contract was signed. Loral said it hasspent $76 million of that amount, including $40 million formaterials, and that it would incur about $39 million ofadditional materials-related costs if the contract werecanceled. That would result in a net charge to earnings of asmuch as $30 million, assuming Loral could use the materialson future orders of the electronic countermeasures, thecompany said. The contract accounted for $245 million ofLoral's $3.1 billion backlog at March 31.   The dispute was disclosed in a prospectus Loral issued inconnection with its offering of four million common shares,which were priced for offering Friday at $40.25 each. LehmanBrothers and Lazard Freres andamp; Co. are leading the underwritinggroup. Loral, a defense, electronics and space communicationsconcern that currently has 25.9 million common sharesoutstanding, said it will use the proceeds for workingcapital, debt repayment and possible acquisitions.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Loralshares closed at $41.25, up 50 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
