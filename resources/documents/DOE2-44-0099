In Ontario, recycling has tended to be impeded by the low apparentcost of landfilling, in which tipping fees have not reflected the truelandfill cost, and by the availability and stability of markets for recycledmaterials. This has been changing with increases in landfill costs andwith programs initiated by government and industry to promote use ofrecycled materials. A private sector commitment has been made by OMMRI,a nonprofit company set up by four soft drink companies and their suppliers,to assist municipalities in establishing curbside multi-material recyclingprograms. The Ontario Ministry of the Environment has also increasedits support for recycling and an infrastructure is being built that eventuallywill enable diversion of 30-50% of municipal wastes from landfill torecycling. In Alberta, where 40% of the population lives in rural areas,recycling programs in small communities tend to address minimizationof waste transport costs first, since this is the largest cost in suchprograms. It has been found useful to rely on small carriers that cancarry small loads on routes they ordinarily travel. A successful programfor collecting compost material has been implemented at low incrementalcost in the town of Riley, and a waste oil collection system has beenset up: a network of tanks throughout the province to provides an effectiveway for oil users to drop off their waste and for re-refiners to collectit. 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
