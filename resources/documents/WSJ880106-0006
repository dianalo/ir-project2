A lawsuit by Mr. Murdoch would allege that the measure passed at the behest of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) violates, among other things, the Constitution's ban against &quot;bills of attainder&quot; -- laws imposing punishment on a person or group because of who they are, according to lawyers familiar with the situation. Legal experts also speculated that Mr. Murdoch could argue that his First Amendment rights were abridged and that the provision violates the constitutional separation of powers.    The measure, tucked into an omnibus spending bill passed by Congress two weeks ago, could effectively force Mr. Murdoch to sell or close his unprofitable New York Post by March 6, and the marginally profitable Boston Herald by June 30. Both newspapers are frequently critical of liberal politicians, such as Sen. Kennedy, who has conceded he was instrumental in getting the provision included in the bill but denies his action was directed at Mr. Murdoch.    Meanwhile, New York Sens. Alfonse D'Amato and Daniel Moynihan, citing the possible loss of a newspaper and many jobs, are preparing legislative maneuvers to reverse the provision. Their efforts are considered long shots, and even if they succeeded it wouldn't give Mr. Murdoch sufficient authority to keep his Boston and New York media properties, which also include two television stations.    Both senators were caught off guard by the provision, although Mr. D'Amato was part of the Senate-House budget conference, where the provision was proposed, and voted for its adoption. A spokeswoman for the Republican senator said he wasn't aware of the provision then or its significance. &quot;They were working so many issues, it was three in the morning and it (the full bill) was 1,000 pages long,&quot; she said, explaining why the senator missed the measure.    As previously reported, the little-noticed provision bars the Federal Communications Commission from scuttling a rule that prohibits a company from owning a newspaper and television station in the same market. It also prohibits the FCC from extending any current waivers from the ban. Mr. Murdoch's closely held News America Corp. is the only company with such waivers in effect, FCC officials have said.    Media analysts consider it unlikely that Mr. Murdoch will find a buyer for the New York Post, which is believed to have losses of $10 million a year. Rather than sell WNYW-TV in New York and WFXT-TV in Boston, they expect him to close down the Post and try to find a buyer for the Herald if the FCC deadline stands.    Michael R. Gardner and Howard Squadron, Mr. Murdoch's Washington and New York counsels, were meeting with their client yesterday and were unavailable for comment. In a statement, Mr. Murdoch said he was &quot;shocked that the rules were changed in the middle of the game.&quot; He said he has been seeking a buyer for the New York Post and &quot;participating with others in the proposed reconsideration of the cross-ownership rules.&quot;    The cross-ownership provision was introduced into the spending bill by Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) at the behest of Sen. Kennedy. Sen. Hollings, who has enormous influence over the FCC as both chairman of the Commerce Committee, which oversees the agency, and the Appropriations Committee panel that sets the agency's funding, didn't bring up the provision during congressional debate for fear it would spark a controversy, staffers said. Instead, he brought it up during the conference designed to iron out differences between the Senate and House spending bills, and attracted little public notice. &quot;Things (passed at the conference) weren't even printed&quot; before senators voted on them, said a Republican staffer.    The Boston Herald, which frequently editorializes against Sen. Kennedy's policies, portrayed the senator as the prime architect of the provision. In a front-page editorial under the headline &quot;Kennedy's Vendetta,&quot; the newspaper yesterday described the senator's involvement as &quot;a dead-of-the-night maneuver . . ., a bullet aimed at the Herald.&quot; A cartoon pictured Sen. Kennedy, armed with a sword, and Sen. Hollings sneaking into a bedroom to slay a sleeping Boston Herald.    &quot;The way this particular amendment was attached (to the spending bill) was done in a very surreptious way,&quot; said Patrick Purcell, publisher of both the New York Post and the Boston Herald.    Mark Fowler, a Washington communications lawyer and the FCC's immediate past chairman, characterized the situation as &quot;a local newspaper being intimidated and bullied by a politician.&quot; The First Amendment, he added, &quot;was precisely designed to protect against that.&quot;    A spokesman for Sen. Hollings denied the measure was aimed specifically at Mr. Murdoch. &quot;Sen. Hollings has been very straightforward on this issue,&quot; said the spokesman. &quot;He opposes the FCC effort to loosen rules.&quot; Meanwhile, at an appearance in Lexington, Mass., yesterday, Sen. Kennedy stated: &quot;The issue is a fundamental First Amendment and antitrust principle. I have no vendetta against the Herald.&quot;    Although securities analysts don't believe Mr. Murdoch would find a buyer for the New York Post, Arthur Carter, a former investment banker who now owns the Nation magazine and the New York Observer, an upstart weekly, said he was &quot;very mildly interested&quot; in possibly acquiring the New York Post.    Of the Boston Herald, Charles Crane, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities said large, publicly traded newspaper concerns probably wouldn't be interested in making a purchase. &quot;There's a tendency in recent years for public (newspaper) companies to pare away papers that aren't dominant in their markets,&quot; he said. &quot;And the Herald certainly isn't dominant in Boston.&quot;    ---   Bob Davis in Washington and David Stipp in Boston contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
