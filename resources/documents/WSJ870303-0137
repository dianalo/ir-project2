Separately, the Labor Department reported that non-farm productivity fell at a 2.2% annual rate in the fourth quarter. The revised drop, though steeper than the previously reported 1.7% rate of decline, didn't alter the previous estimate that overall productivity gained 0.7% for all of 1986.    January's rise in construction spending followed a revised 0.9% drop in December. Previously, the Commerce Department estimated the December decline was 0.5%. Construction outlays rose 1.6% last April.    Construction spending in January followed a pattern that many economists expect will persist for much of the year: strength in home building was offset by weakness in the nonresidential sector, which is likely to be hit hard by tax-law changes and high vacancy rates in many areas.    Residential outlays rose 1.2% in January after dropping 2% in December; nonresidential spending fell a sharp 4.2% after declining 1.9% the previous month. Overall private construction slipped 0.2% in January after falling 1.6% a month earlier.    &quot;The nonresidential component keeps slipping away and residential construction remains fairly firm,&quot; said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. He added that the decline in nonresidential construction, coupled with last week's report of a plunge in orders for big-ticket factory items in January, &quot;suggests that capital spending is starting off the year on a down note.&quot;    The public sector remained vibrant in January. Such construction spending gained 5.6% after rising 2% in December.    Overall, the January rise brought construction spending to an annual rate of $378.5 billion from $374.9 billion in December. The January outlays were up 1.4% from a year earlier.    Measured in 1982 dollars to eliminate the effects of inflation, construction spending rose 1.1% from December to a $336.7 billion annual pace and was down 0.3% from a year earlier.    The construction figures are adjusted for seasonal variation.    The sluggish advance of non-farm productivity in 1986 reflected moderate growth during the first half of the year and declines in the third and fourth quarters, the Labor Department said. The revised fourth-quarter decline followed a third-quarter drop at an annual rate of 0.3%.    All the quarterly figures are adjusted for seasonal variation.    Gains in productivity, the measure of output per hour worked, haven't been as strong during the current business recovery as those posted during previous recoveries. In 1985, non-farm productivity rose 0.5%.    The revised report said that during 1986, output in the non-farm sector grew 2.7% compared with the 2.8% previously estimated, while hours worked increased 2%, unchanged from the previous report. Hourly compensation increased at a 3% rate and unit labor costs rose 2.3%, both unchanged from the previous report.    The revised figures show that non-farm output grew at an annual rate of 1.9% in the fourth quarter, while hours worked rose at a 4.3% rate. The department had earlier said its estimated 1.7% rate of decline reflected a 2.4% annual increase in output and a 4.2% rise in hours worked.    Hourly compensation increased at a 2.7% annual rate in the fourth quarter, but was unchanged when inflation was taken into account. Unit labor costs increased at a 5.1% annual rate during the same period. The department earlier had estimated that hourly compensation rose at a 3.1% rate while unit labor costs grew at a 4.9% rate during the quarter.    Business productivity, including that of farms, rose 0.7% in 1986 as output grew 2.5% and hours worked increased 1.9%. Those figures all were unchanged from the previous report. For the fourth quarter, business productivity fell at a revised 2.8% annual rate, compared with a previously reported decline at a 2.3% annual rate.    For the year, manufacturing productivity rose 2.7%, unchanged from the previous report, as output grew 2.5% and hours worked fell 0.2%. Fourth-quarter manufacturing productivity declined at a 0.1% annual rate, less than the previously reported drop of 1% at an annual rate, as output rose at a 3.3% annual rate and hours worked grew at a 3.4% annual rate. The productivity decline was the first since the 1985 fourth quarter in this sector, but increases in output and hours were the largest of the year.    The department also reported in a preliminary estimate that productivity of nonfinancial corporations, which account for almost 60% of the nation's output, was flat in 1986, as output and hours worked both gained 1.8%. Hourly compensation rose 2.4% in 1986 in this sector, the smallest rise since these figures were first recorded in 1959, and increased only 0.5% after inflation-adjustment.    Here are the Commerce Department's figures for construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally adjusted annual rates.                                    Jan.     Dec.
