Reports on studies into methods ofremote monitoring, suitable for the severe mine environment. The mostadvanced solid state TV-cameras are reviewed. Examines requirements asto spark proof equipment and signal transmission protected from strongelectromagnetic interference. Directions of research in this field conductedat IGD im. A.A. Skochinskogo are outlined. Ultrasound, pulsed opticalwaves and radiowaves and laser radiation are considered. New optical-electronictransducers allow visualization at very poor lighting of 0.01-0.5 lx;light intensity may vary by several orders of magnitude. An infraredcamera was developed using wavelengths of 4-14 micrometers, that allowsdetecting hot machine parts or cold spots at working faces indicatingmethane emission and imminent rock burst hazard. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
