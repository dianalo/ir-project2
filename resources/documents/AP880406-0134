(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge today granted surrogate mother MaryBeth Whitehead-Gould immediate, unsupervised visitation of eighthours a week with the child she agreed to bear under a $10,000contract.   Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween said Mrs. Whitehead-Gould'svisits with 2-year-old Melissa Stern would be expanded from oneeight-hour day weekly to two days every other week in September,overnight visits in April 1989 and two weeks during that summer.   ``The court finds no credible evidence or expert opinion thatMelissa will suffer any psychological or emotional harm bycontinued and expanded visitation with her mother,'' Sween said.   His order barred both sides in the case from discussing Melissapublicly, such as in the promotion of books or movies.   The Sterns had argued during a three-day visitation hearing lastweek that Mrs. Whitehead-Gould would use Melissa in a tour topromote a book she is writing about the case.   Sween's order doesn't not affect publication of Mrs.Whitehead-Gould's book, however, nor does it have any effect on atelevision movie being made about the case.   The judge also ordered the adults in the case to undergocounseling to ease the emotional burden on the child, who liveswith her father, William Stern, and his wife, Elizabeth. TheSterns, who hired Mrs. Whitehead-Gould as a surrogate, have custodyof Melissa   ``The court finds that Melissa's best interests will be servedby unsupervised, uninterrupted liberal visitation with hermother,'' Sween said in a written decision given to attorneys.   ``She and her mother have the right to develop their own specialrelationship,'' the judge said.   In a statement issued by her attorneys, Mrs. Whitehead-Gouldsaid she was happy her relationship with her daughter ``has beenpreserved.''   ``I am delighted and grateful to know that as Melissa grows up,we'll have a meaningful and substantial relationship with eachother,'' she said.   The Sterns were disappointed by the decision, said theirattorney, Gary Skoloff, noting that the Sterns had sought to delaycontact between Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and Melissa for several years.   ``We did not get the hiatus we asked for,'' said Skoloff. ``Theywere pleased with the mandatory counseling. And they were pleasedwith the privacy issue.''   He said the Sterns would make no public statement on the ruling.   Skoloff had said following the three-day hearing last week thatthe couple did not plan to appeal Sween's decision, whatever theoutcome.   The Sterns argued that visitation should be stopped for at leastsix years, while Mrs. Whitehead-Gould sought the graduallyexpanded, unsupervised visitation she won today.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, an East Brunswick housewife who turns 31Thursday, was allowed to visit the child for two hours once a weekunder supervision during the legal battle.   She testified during the custody hearing that her daughter wouldbenefit by a ``more natural'' relationship with her mother.   The Sterns said they feared Mrs. Whitehead-Gould couldemotionally harm the child and try to undermine their relationshipwith Melissa.   If there is no appeal, today's ruling would bring to a close ahighly publicized, unprecedented court battle that sparked aworldwide debate on parents' rights and reproductive technologies.   The dispute began shortly after the child's birth March 31,1986, when Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, then married to Richard Whiteheadand the mother of two, decided to turn down the $10,000 surrogacyfee and refused to hand over the child. No money ever changedhands. Mrs. Whitehead-Gould is now expecting her fourth child byher second husband, Dean Gould.   The Sterns turned to surrogacy because they feared Mrs. Stern,42, who suffers from a mild form of multiple sclerosis, coulddevelop complications with the disease during pregnancy.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould fled with the baby to Florida for threemonths before authorities tracked her down and returned the childto the Sterns, setting the stage for the emotional court battleover custody.   After a three-month trial, Superior Court Judge Harvey R. Sorkowupheld the surrogate contract and stripped Mrs. Whitehead-Gould ofher parental rights, ordering her never to see the child again. Thejudge then presided over a speedy adoption of the child by Mrs.Stern.   But the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned most of Sorkow'sruling in its landmark Feb. 3 ruling. The state's highest courtoutlawed surrogacy-for-pay and restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould'sparental rights, but upheld custody for the Sterns while orderingthe lower court hearing on visitation rights.</TEXT></DOC>
