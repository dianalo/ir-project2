After years of defending its presence as a force for change in the racially divided country, IBM reversed itself last fall and set plans to get out. But rather than sell its local subsidiary to a white-owned company, as in most corporate withdrawals, IBM sold to a new trust created, it said, &quot;for the benefit of employees.&quot; They would share some profits and an equity stake.    &quot;Since nearly a quarter of the employees are nonwhite, this is a particularly important economic opportunity for them,&quot; IBM said.    But Big Blue benefits, too. By selling the subsidiary to an offshore trust of its own making and financing the sale, IBM sidestepped political pressure, stayed in the market and indirectly can take money out of South Africa at a preferential exchange rate. Workers will share only a tiny slice of future profits, and white employees, with generally better jobs, will get more money and equity than blacks.    As the corporate pullouts from South Africa continue, more companies are following IBM's lead. Since last December, Exxon Corp., General Motors Corp., Fluor Corp. and others have sold all or part of their subsidiaries to employee trusts. In June, Ford Motor Co. said it hopes to leave South Africa and donate a stake in a jointly owned auto maker to a new trust.    Although the trusts appear to give economic power to black South Africans, they get little influence on decisions. And the American companies so far have benefited the most. &quot;It's a fairly elaborate scheme to maximize the receipts&quot; the companies get from selling subsidiaries, says Edward Southey, a Johannesburg lawyer who has set up trusts for U.S. companies. Most such trusts, he notes, &quot;call for the purchase price to be paid in full before dividends go to beneficiaries.&quot;    U.S. companies also are considering other ways to reduce or eliminate their exposure in South Africa: by helping blacks buy white-owned businesses, forming charitable trusts, moving to a neighboring nation and selling to a central foundation. But the employee trust is easily the most popular.    &quot;It makes great public relations back home,&quot; a South African lawyer says. At the same time, the trusts best serve corporate economic goals -- retaining sales in the South African market and continuing to serve customers there while providing a foothold for possibly returning in the future. The companies say the trusts are autonomous, but the companies can hold buy-back options and provide products, technology and trademarks to their former subsidiaries.    Usually, a company forms a trust in a tax haven, often on the English Channel islands of Guernsey or Jersey. It sells to the trust, finances the sale and holds the debt. The trust pays back the company -- the preferred creditor -- over as long as 10 years, at a favorable exchange rate. The trust takes money out of South Africa as dividends, which leave at the &quot;commercial&quot; rate of 50 cents per rand. In a normal pullout, the South African government imposes the &quot;financial&quot; rate of only 30 cents per rand, and the companies get less money.    At IBM's old subsidiary, which has only 22 black managers, nonwhites represent 23% of the employees but will get just 13% of the equity. &quot;That may seem a small percentage,&quot; says a spokesman at the former unit, now called Information Services Management Ltd., but &quot;these guys have an investment, and it will grow.&quot; The stake won't have real market value unless ISM goes public -- a move that would be dictated by five IBM -- appointed trustees. Four of them are ISM's top white executives; the fifth is a black consultant.    The 1,500 employees will share 3% of pretax profits, but only if ISM earnings hit 80% of a management-set goal. The profit-sharing rises to 10% if the unit hits 150% of the goal -- unlikely in a troubled economy. At 3%, the sum may fall short of the $3 million a year IBM spends in South Africa to finance black business and teach black children to read.    &quot;Whether what they are giving is enough is debatable,&quot; says Reuel Jethro Khoza, the lone black trustee. &quot;Three percent of a small figure could be nothing, 3% of a huge figure could be something.&quot; But he adds, &quot;The question of sincerity isn't debatable. They take me extremely seriously.&quot; IBM didn't include a buy-back option, but the company won't say whether a loan default by the trust would allow it to repossess ISM, whose only product line is IBM computers.    Although employee-trust provisions vary from company to company, they generally agree on the main priority. The &quot;first obligation is to repay the purchase price,&quot; as Fluor puts it. And Exxon says its trust may donate to black charities after it has &quot;paid off the debt to us.&quot;    Beyond that, Exxon excluded buy-back and product-supply links when it sold petroleum and chemical operations to a trust formed on Jersey. The trust will pay 2.5% of pretax profits to 200 workers. All will get the same percentage of pay. So, higher-paid people -- whites -- will get more money.    But a buy-back option was &quot;a motivating factor&quot; in Fluor's sale of a construction company to a European trust. &quot;When things change there, we'd look forward to going back in. Things would have to change here, too,&quot; a spokesman says. Fluor won't say whether the 1,500 employees will get equity and profits.    The English Channel trust set up by Johnson Controls Inc. won't share any profits or equity with employees. After meeting the &quot;first priority&quot; -- repaying the thermostat maker -- any leftover money will go to worker benefits, says James Wade, its chief financial officer. But the unit isn't expected to earn a profit for a few years.    The trust approach &quot;sounds awfully convoluted, and it is,&quot; says Charles Valkin, a white lawyer in Johannesburg. Besides, he argues, &quot;Blacks in our social structure don't have a tradition of holding shares. It isn't going to mean a great deal to them -- they want money, not paper.&quot; He adds: &quot;If I were advising a client, I'd say it won't work.&quot;    Indeed, 2,000 workers struck a General Motors plant last fall when GM pulled out, and several hundred were fired. GM paid off the unit's debt and sold a 50% stake to a trust, which will share an undisclosed slice of profits with &quot;selected employees.&quot; (White managers bought the rest.) But workers wanted severance pay and cash benefits. They complained that GM didn't give them a say in the decision to sell.    Although 60% of the unit's 3,000 workers are black, Asian, Indian or of mixed race, all five trustees are white. &quot;There wasn't any effort to find someone of a particular color. That wasn't important, that they be white or black,&quot; a GM spokesman says.    Most companies won't talk much about the South Africa issue. Executives literally ran from the television cameras at a Washington news conference in June to avoid defending their South African presence on screen. And some executives may wonder why they should give workers any equity or profits, and they fear that employees in other countries might demand similar treatment.    But on June 3, a main moral defense for staying suffered a blow. The Rev. Leon Sullivan abandoned his own Sullivan Principles, which for a decade had urged companies to offer equal pay, give to charity and protest against apartheid. He now calls for a mass pullout.    Consultants say the new efforts are in tacit recognition that black rule is inevitable in South Africa -- someday. U.S. companies, once closely tied to the white government, now believe that they must reach out to 25 million blacks if they are to have a stake in the nation's future. In June, Ford, ITT Corp. and Citicorp joined the 140 U.S. companies that have withdrawn since 1985. Over the weekend, Allegis Corp.'s Hertz subsidiary announced plans to leave. Fewer than 200 U.S. companies are left.    For many companies, the issue now has shifted from whether to leave to how to get out. They worry that &quot;divestment in itself won't be enough; it has to be done in the right way to be acceptable,&quot; says Clay Wescott of Wescott andamp; Associates, a Cambridge, Mass., consultant. Virtually all pullouts so far have put assets into white hands. Now, activists are urging companies to share the wealth with blacks.    &quot;We've moved past equal opportunity in employment to questions of economic justice and ownership. People have a right to own the fruits of their own labor,&quot; says Marcy Murninghan, the president of The Lighthouse Investment Group, a Boston consulting firm that pushes the equity approach.    Nonetheless, some American companies -- Mobil Corp., Colgate-Palmolive Co., Johnson andamp; Johnson, Merck andamp; Co. and others -- insist that they will stay and push harder for change. &quot;It is our intent to do even more than we have in the past,&quot; says Marshall B. Bass, senior vice president of RJR Nabisco Inc., which has doubled spending on black services.    But one lawyer counters, &quot;The day people stand up and shout the most -- 'We'll never go' -- is the day they instruct attorneys to start preparing to pull out.&quot; Citicorp left days after passionately defending its presence. South African lawyers are working seven-day weeks on new pullouts. Twenty companies have asked U.S. Treasury Department officials for advice on rules for withdrawal.    A recent poll conducted for Ford and others shows that 56% of Americans believe U.S. companies should turn over at least partial stakes in their South African units to blacks while continuing to supply the subsidiaries with materials and technology.    Consultants hold out the most hope for Ford's efforts to donate more than half of its 42% stake in a South African car maker to a new employee trust. But so far, the black union from which Ford is seeking support has reacted coolly, wary of aligning itself with management and taking a stake in an often-unprofitable venture. One big obstacle: That stake is just shy of giving workers a veto over major decisions voted by shareholders.    Other companies are pursuing other courses. In April, Union Carbide Corp. formed a foundation that will donate to South African charities half of its annual profits in an electrical-parts business -- a gift of $1.7 million this year. Coca-Cola Co. sold its unit to white management last year and moved a syrup plant to Swaziland. It also helped black investors negotiate for the recent purchase of a 49% stake in a white-owned bottling plant. Now, the old Coke unit is helping the sale of a 10% stake in a soda distributor to 6,000 mom-and-pop store owners; most are black.    &quot;Since 70% of our consumers are black, it's always going to be beneficial to involve blacks in equity,&quot; says Sandy Allan, the head of the old Coke unit. He hopes to &quot;teach blacks that capitalism isn't evil; it's beneficial, a job-producer.&quot;    Meanwhile, six companies are considering a cross-border move to Botswana to dodge criticism but stay in the market. They are said to include a drug maker and Colgate. Colgate admits to considering Botswana but says that wouldn't mean leaving South Africa.    Consultants doubt that the cross-border option would work, given Botswana's raw countryside and untrained work force. Says Graham Hatton of Business International in London: &quot;Politically, one can understand the idea. But economically, it just doesn't make sense.&quot;    But experts have higher hopes for another option: the Ikwezi Foundation. A dozen businessmen, most of them black, propose a central foundation that would acquire subsidiaries of departing U.S. companies. An American bank has offered financing. The group has been approached by more than a dozen companies -- said to include Merck and Sterling Drug Inc. (both of which decline comment). Some companies hope to sell or donate stakes in their units while remaining in South Africa.    Details aren't settled, but the foundation, instead of individuals, would own the assets. White managers would stay to run the business and train blacks. Some profits would go to black services.    Ikwezi, the Zulu name for the first morning star on the South African horizon, was conceived a year ago by Robert L. Appelbaum, a white South African lawyer, and Rev. Allan Boesak, the black South African who heads the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and helped found the opposition United Democratic Front. The two had discussed the dubious benefit of U.S. pullouts. &quot;I decided one day I didn't want to see my country burning,&quot; Mr. Appelbaum says.    For more than a year, Mr. Wescott, Mr. Appelbaum and Makana Tshabalala, the black president of the Soweto Chamber of Commerce, have quietly tried to build support. It's &quot;a political mine field,&quot; Mr. Appelbaum says. Some people fear that Ikwezi verges on nationalization of industry. Companies won't back it unless black labor does. Labor may dislike aligning itself with capitalism and management.    Nobody knows how the South African government will react. &quot;This isn't the time to take the chance and ask them that,&quot; says Mr. Appelbaum, who adds that his home phone is bugged. Meantime, more departures loom, and he fears that the opportunity is fading.    &quot;We've lost companies that were really interested because we weren't able to give them anything concrete,&quot; Mr. Appelbaum says. &quot;It just has been dragging on for too long.&quot; He won't pursue the Ikwezi proposal if black labor attacks it. Without a breakthrough soon, he adds, he may give up.    ---            South Africa's Flight Of Corporations   Some 144 U.S. companies have withdrawn from South Africaor announced such plans since January 1985.
