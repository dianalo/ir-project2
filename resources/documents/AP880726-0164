The army confirmed the girl's death but said it had notdetermined the cause.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin toured a detention center in Gazaand vowed to quell the eight-month old Palestinian uprising in theoccupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.   ``We don't accept the present level of violence,'' Rabin toldIsrael television. ``On the contrary, today we have the methods. Itwill take some time but we shall succeed.'' He did not elaborate.   The military commander of the West Bank lifted a curfew that hadconfined more than 120,000 Nablus residents to their homes sincelast Thursday, the army announced.   It said Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna took the action as a gesture ofgoodwill for the holiday of Eid al-Adha, the Moslem Feast ofSacrifice.   In Gaza, 13-year-old Suheir Fuad Afana of the Beach refugee campwas critically wounded when she was hit in the stomach by armygunfire, said a Shifa Hospital surgeon. The girl died on theoperating table, according to the doctor, who spoke on thecondition he not be identified.   Hospital officials said troops also shot and wounded three boysranging in age from 11 to 15 and that all three were hit in thelower body.   Army officials confirmed the death but said they were unable todetermine the cause because the family took the girl's body fromthe hospital.   They said an army unit sent to break up a riot in the Beach campopened fire when Palestinians ``hurled bricks at it from a closedistance.''   The army said soldiers fired at the brick throwers and it waschecking to determine if the girl's death was a result of theshooting.   A curfew was imposed on the Beach camp, home to about 42,000Palestinians.   According to Arab reports, the clashes started about 6 p.m., andprotests continued for several hours after the girl was killed. AnArab reporter said the body was brought back to the camp whereresidents marched, shouting ``Allahu akbar!'' or ``God is great!''   The fatality brought to 234 the number of Palestinians killedsince the Dec. 8 start of the uprising, in which four Israelis alsohave died.   In the West Bank, an army spokesman quoted Mitzna as saying helifted curfews after Arab leaders had appealed to the army's civiladministration to ease the restrictions.   Right-wing Israeli settlers, who built their West Bank homes inthe heart of the Arab city of Hebron, warned of an escalation ofviolence following a bomb blast earlier in the day.   The settlers told Israel army radio they might retaliate for asmall, homemade bomb that caused no injuries when it exploded neara playground.   In the West Bank town of Beit Jalla, hundreds of Palestiniansmourned a man killed by soldiers Sunday.   The mourners draped the dead man's home with outlawedPalestinian flags, and chanted ``With our spirit and blood, we willavenge the martyr!''   Palestinians say Jeris Kunkar, 40, was an innocent passer-by whowas shot to death by troops chasing a stone-throwing group of Arabyouths. The army said Kunkar, who was hit by three bullets, wasshot when a soldier tripped and his gun fired accidentally.   Troops stayed out of Beit Jalla during the service to reducetensions, Israeli radio said.   In the predominantly Arab Israeli city of Jaffa, near Tel Aviv,police arrested three Arab citizens suspected of destroying $1.25million worth of Jewish property through vandalism and arson, theItim news agency reported.   All of the damage was done during the Palestinian uprising, andthe suspects apparently were motivated by sympathies with the Arabsin the occupied territories, Itim said.</TEXT></DOC>
