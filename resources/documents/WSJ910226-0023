The plan is part of proposals by Luxembourg, currentholder of the EC presidency, that would transfer mucheconomic sovereignty from national governments. Economicguidelines could then be set by the EC.   The proposals, aimed at serving as a basis for treatynegotiations, would impose sanctions on nations that fail tofollow economic guidelines drawn up by EC ministers or thatrun &quot;excessive budgetary deficits.&quot; Penalties weren't listed.   Separately, the EC gave final approval for a loan of 2.2billion European currency units ($3.02 billion) to Greececontingent on a radical overhaul of its economy through 1993.In the 12-nation bloc, Greece has the highest inflation rate,at 22%, and biggest budget deficit, at 18.4% of grossdomestic product. Under the loan's terms, Greece must slashits public payroll, government borrowing, inflation anddeficit, and improve tax collection.                                                                                                          POLAND TO GET ANTI-POLLUTION AID                                                                                                          Electric Power Development Co., owned by Japan and nineutilities, will provide technical aid for Poland to stempollution from coal-operated thermal power stations, whichaccount for 84% of the nation's generating plants. Theassistance is part of Japan's official development aid tohelp Warsaw combat environmental degradation. Poland lackssufficient pollution-control technology, includingdesulfurization techniques.                                                                                                          BONN'S FUNDING NEEDS GROW                                                                                                          Germany's additional financing needs are expected to totalat least 20 billion marks ($13.28 billion) this year andabout 30 billion marks a year subsequently. Leaders of thecenter-right coalition government hope to complete the planto raise taxes starting July 1, to help finance Germany'scontribution to the Gulf war effort, large aid transfers toeastern Europe and costs of rebuilding eastern Germany'seconomy.                                                                                                          SPAIN'S TOURISM DWINDLES                                                                                                          Visitors to Spain in January fell 11% to 2.4 million froma year earlier. Tourism revenue accounts for 10% of grossdomestic product and 40% of foreign currency earnings. Thenumber of U.S. tourists took one of the steepest dives, 40%to 32,226, as Americans curtailed travel abroad after theGulf war began Jan. 17. Declines were logged by Britishvisitors, 6.3% to 256,328; French, 9.7% to 469,946, andJapanese, 14% to 16,231. But the number of German touristsrose 8.4% to 301,714.                                                                                                          COMECON'S DEMISE IS DELAYED                                                                                                          Comecon, the Soviet-led Eastern trading bloc, postponedindefinitely a meeting scheduled for this week in Budapest.The session was intended to dissolve the obsoleteCoordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls,which regulated trade among Communist countries. With theadvent of democracy and the introduction of market economiesin East Europe, the nine-nation group lost its significance.Comecon nations have conducted trade this year in hardcurrency. Differences about a successor group were said tocause the postponement.                                                                                                          TAIWAN SEIZES COUNTERFEIT MONEY                                                                                                          Taiwan police seized fake Chinese money with a face valueof more than $1.9 million and arrested seven suspectedcounterfeiters. The notes were apparently intended for saleto tens of thousands of Taiwanese who visit mainland Chinaevery year for business and tourism. Taipei has beenofficially at war with Beijing since the Communist Party woncontrol of China in 1949, but unofficial economic andcultural links have blossomed since 1987, when Taiwan eased atravel ban.                                                                                                          MALAYSIAN AIR REVAMP ORDERED                                                                                                          The cabinet has ordered Malaysian Airline System to revampits administration and study the possibility of separatingits unprofitable domestic operations from its profitableinternational lines.   The flag carrier must propose a restructuring that couldinclude selling the domestic operations and some profitableregional routes. The cabinet believes Malaysian Air has&quot;grown beyond its optimal size to perform effectively,&quot; agovernment official said. The action followed months ofcriticism of the airline's passenger service and topexecutives in the national media, largely controlled bymember parties of the ruling National Front coalition.   Some analysts fretted that assets may be sold topolitically well-connected individuals or concerns.Speculation focuses on a takeover by Roxy Electric Industries(Malaysia) Bhd. and Malaysian Helicopter Services Bhd., bothcontrolled by Tajudin Ramli, a former business protege of thefinance minister.   Though the airline is profitable, its domestic operationscontribute little to its bottom line. And with the bulk ofits shares held by the government and government-affiliatedbodies, it must abide by official directives to provideadequate, affordable domestic service.
