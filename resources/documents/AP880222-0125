Col. William Higgins in which he repeatedthe demands of his captors in Lebanon has no validity because itwas made under duress.   ``All statements made by hostages are made under duress,'' saidState Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, echoing a similarcomment by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   Mrs. Oakley noted that the demands, including an Israeliwithdrawal from its border security zone in south Lebanon, are thesame as those announced last Friday by the Organization of theOpporessed on Earth, one of two groups which claim to have kidnapedHiggins.   She also disputed a statement by Peggy Say, sister of thelongest-held American hostage in Lebanon, that the administrationis displaying a double standard by working hardest to free captivesseized most recently.   ``We all can understand and sympathize with her anguish and herfrustration and her sorrow over her brother's continuingcaptivity,'' Mrs. Oakley said.   ``We're making our efforts on behalf of all the hostages. Ourgoal is not the release of this one or that one but rather the safereturn of all the hostages.''   Mrs. Say's brother, Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, was kidnapped on March 16,1985.   Mrs. Say contended that the U.S. government has been lessvigorous in seeking out her brother than Higgins, a onetime topaide to former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.   At the White House, Fitzwater said the Higgins videotape hadbeen viewed by members of the National Security Council and WhiteHouse staff but he did not believe President Reagan had seen it.   ``We continue to call for the immediate and safe release ofColonel Higgins as well as other hostages in Lebanon,'' Fitzwatersaid. ``We are not going to give in to the demands of terrorists.We will continue to pursue all avenues for his release.''   Asked if Reagan had any reaction, the spokesman said, ``You knowthe president's deep convictions about Colonel Higgins and all thehostages, but we want to avoid saying anything that couldexacerbate the situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
