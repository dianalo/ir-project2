(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Milken, who faces insidertrading charges, is seen as the Wall Street whiz kid who made``junk-bond'' financing into the tool of choice for corporateraiders.   In so doing, Milken, 42, transformed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.from a minor player on Wall Street into a powerhouse and in theprocess made himself feared, respected and enormously wealthy.   The 184-page civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in NewYork against Milken, Drexel and others on Wednesday followed monthsof speculation about Drexel's involvement in the Ivan Boeskyinsider trading scandal.   Although the move by the Securities and Exchange Commission hadbeen anticipated, Milken and others who have made fortunes in junkbonds continued to hold their annual Beverly Hills spring gatheringknown as the Predators' Ball. The message was clear: Never mind theburgeoning government investigation of insider trading. It wasbusiness as usual at Drexel, and Milken was still king of the junkbonds _ high-risk, high-yield notes used to finance corporatetakeovers.   Milken had refused to comment publicly on the scandal up untilWednesday, when he issued a written statement asserting that ``forthe past 22 months I have been the subject of a shadow trial ofsystematic leaks and innuendo based on false accusations.''   In anticipation of a crisis, Drexel undertook a public-relationscampaign starting last year to polish its image, stressing the roleof junk bonds in helping small companies and downplaying their rolein large takeover battles.   The normally secretive and unreachable Milken himself played amajor role in that blitz, accepting speaking engagements. Hegranted selective media interviews _ on condition there would be noquestions about the Securities and Exchange Commission and theinvestigation.   The speeches and interviews focused almost solely on Milken'slatest pet plan _ to alleviate the Latin American debt crisis byswapping debt for equity or selling securities backed by thosecountries' oil and silver resources.   In the years before the insider trading scandal, the financialmedia wrote glowingly of Milken.   ``A one-man revolution,'' Forbes magazine headlined one typicalarticle.   ``A world-class financial wizard, on a plane with the likes ofBernard Baruch and Jay Gould ... Mozart of the money markets,''wrote California Business magazine.   It had been a relatively short road for Milken, from headcheerleader at Birmingham High School in the San Fernando Valley in1964 _ actress Sally Field and superagent Michael Ovitz were amonghis classmates _ to the top of the nation's financial industry.   Milken reportedly pulls down $40 million a year as the head ofDrexel's junk-bond operation and his personal fortune has beenestimated at more than $500 million.   He lives with his children and wife, Lori _ his high schoolsweetheart whom he married at age 22 _ in a house on the formerestate of the late actor Clark Gable in suburban Encino, anupper-middle-class section of the San Fernando Valley two milesfrom his childhood home.   Milken's fascination with finance stetches back to his boyhood.   At age 10, while other boys were giggling over comic books,Michael Robert Milken was enamored of money. A favorite pastime washovering over tax returns being prepared by his father, anaccountant.   After studying business at the University of California,Berkeley, and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School,Milken went to work for Drexel Firestone andamp; Co. in Philadelphia as ajunior bond trader.   Drexel merged with Burnham andamp; Co. in 1973 and Lambert BrusselsWitter in 1976 to become today's Drexel Burnham Lambert, andMilken's job was moved to New York.   Milken worked hard to make a name for himself but never got usedto the East. As the story goes, he wearied of the cold Easternwinters that froze his water pipes and kept his two children fromplaying outside. He also tired of the long commutes from his homein suburban Philadelphia to Wall Street.   In 1977, he pulled off a coup by convincing Drexel to let himmove the company's junk-bond operations from Wall Street to BeverlyHills, just off swank Rodeo Drive.   His reasoning was simple: He didn't have to be sitting in a tinyoffice in Manhattan to make deals. He just had to know the playersand have their confidence.   Milken was enormously successful in that regard, almostsingle-handedly building a close-knit network of junk-bondinvestors. Milken no longer has to go on the road to make deals.The corporate players come to him.   Milken still works hard _ 12 to 13 hours a day, seven days aweek. He once said he had no hobbies ``because what I do is fun.''   Milken's appearance generally is described as ordinary. He buyshis suits off the rack, and it was only a couple years ago that hetraded in his unstylish American car for a Mercedes.</TEXT></DOC>
