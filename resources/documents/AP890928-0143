Security was tightened for a second day in the capital asauthorities tried to stop a wave of bombings that officials blameon the drug lords.   A high-ranking government official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said in a telephone interview that of the 375 aircraftseized in the past six weeks, 180 were found to have been used indrug trafficking and were turned over to the Colombian air force.

Since President Virgilio Barco declared war on the nation's drugdealers Aug. 19, security forces also have seized 525 vehicles and74 boats.   The government source said that 100 of the aircraft werereturned to the owners because there was no proof they were used tohaul drugs. The Drug Council has not identified the owners.   The council consists of five Cabinet ministers, the attorneygeneral and the chief of the national police. The ministers did notreturn telephone calls Thursday and could not be reached forcomment.   Barco said Tuesday that as part of the crackdown, securityforces also had seized 1,056 mansions, ranches and other property.   The owners cannot reclaim the property unless they prove incourt that they bought it with legally earned money.
