The plan was announced yesterday after a six-day CommunistParty plenum in Beijing involving 584 senior party members.The main thrust of the 1991-95 guidelines is to retaincurrent economic reforms while looking for ways to keep mosteconomic activity under government control. But the plan alsowill hold in reserve some more-radical reform tools for useshould emergencies arise.</LP><TEXT>   The economic blueprint reflects Beijing's continuedconcern with maintaining stability in a country undermined bywidespread unemployment, growing income disparities and adraining dependence on state subsidies. Moreover, Beijinghardliners have encountered strong resistance to a full-scaleeconomic retrenchment in several pre-plenum meetings.   While conservative leaders might have wanted to turn theclock back on economic reform or find ways to reconcileMarxism with a market economy, the instinct forself-preservation has won out.   A statement after the plenum said China's future dependedon the &quot;universal truth of Marxism.&quot; But it also said reformsin &quot;prices, finance, taxation, banking, planning, investmentand labor and wages . . . should center around the goal ofestablishing a new economic system.&quot;   The details of the documents that party leaders approved,including a 10-year blueprint for longer-term goals similarto those of the Five-Year Plan, weren't publicized. Someinformation will be made public when China's rubber-stampparliament, the National People's Congress, approves the planin March. The Five-Year Plan isn't as crucial to China'seconomy as it used to be. After a decade of reform, much ofChina's economy operates outside the plan, and its chieffunction is to allocate credit and approve major constructionprojects -- not allot materials and set output levels, as itonce did.   Based on bits of information that trickle through, Chinaseems headed for much of the same. Foreign investment will bewelcomed, but the government will continue to be moreselective. Top priorities are needed technology and factoriesmaking products currently imported.   In a widely expected change, the central government'sconstruction money, as well as infrastructure loans providedby foreign countries and world development organizations,will be aimed at central China -- the provinces bordering theYangtze River and its gateway, Shanghai. The idea is to bringprosperity from the coast into China's heartland and easeincome disparities. The 1985-90 plan emphasized southernChina and five special economic zones, and their prosperityhas far outpaced the rest of the country.   The most troublesome issues, which sparked fierce debateand delayed the party plenum for several months, remainmostly unresolved. The provinces and the central governmenthaven't agreed on a new tax structure. Currently, all taxesare collected by local officials, and payments are fixedamounts set by contract. Thus, tax revenues don't rise as theeconomy grows and most of the money is siphoned off before itreaches Beijing, which faces a $14 billion budget deficitthis year.   It also appears that no innovative methods were devisedfor ending China's addiction to subsidies to citizens in theform of cheap rent, food and transportation and tostate-owned corporations to keep them afloat.   The party has set the vague goal of reducing pricesubsidies over time if opportune circumstances arise. Sincethey ordered troops to fire on demonstrators in Beijing inJune 1989, China's leaders have been consumed by fears ofinstability -- so no radical price reforms are planned.</TEXT></DOC>
