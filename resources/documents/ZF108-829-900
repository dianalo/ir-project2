(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Perhaps more than any other type of computer equipment, portables take abeating.andP;  They're regularly stored under airplane seats during turbulenttranscontinental flights, driven over potholescarred streets of major cities,and asked to withstand the rigors of a day out in the field-sometimesliterally.andP;  All things considered, it seems a wonder that any portable,whether of notebook, laptop, clamshell, or lunchbox design, manages tosurvive and even thrive for years at a time.andM;True, our survey shows that portables don't have the highest reliabilityranking of all the categories, but they do score a solid 87 out of a possibleI 00.andP;  That's not too shabby, particularly when you consider that the averageage of these portable systems is nearly two years.andP;  And although portableshave the second-highest percentage of overall problem incidences, the dubioushonor of first place belongs to desktop personal computers, which are lesslikely to be moved, tossed, and rattled.andP;  THE LOWDOWN ON THE BREAKDOWN Of the18,000-plus people responding to the survey, 4,087 indicate that they own aportable.andP;  We arranged the responses according to three classes: 8086/8088portables (along with machines using the comparable NEC V20, V30, and V40processors), 80286 systems, and 80386/ 386SX models.andP;  Some of the best-knownportable manufacturers-Compaq, IBM, NEC, Sharp, Tandy, Toshiba, andZenith-boast enough responses for us to draw significant conclusionsregarding these companies, and often regarding specific products or productlines.andP;  While fewer than 75 respondents indicate that they use systems fromcompanies like Datavue, Epson, GRID Systems, Kaypro, or Mitsubishi, the namerecognition these companies have (and not always for the best of reasons)makes it worthwhile for us to include detailed analyses of them.andP;  Remember,though, that in these instances we can't predict valid patterns but can onlytell you the experiences and thoughts of our small base of respondents.andM;Additionally, wherever we have under 30 responses for a given company, thesampling is really too small for a valid analysis, so you'll find that somewellknown names like Dolch, Mitsuba, and PC Brand are missing here.andO;Hewlett-Packard, with 47 respondents, is also missing: though it still offerssupport for its portable products, it discontinued that line over a year anda half ago.andP;  HP portable users may be comforted to note, however, that therespondents we have heard from give the company very high marks for itsportables' reliability.andP;  DIFFERENT FROM DESKTOPS As we have learned, usersdon't think there is any such thing as a dead lobster when it comes toportables.andP;  In today's business world, anyone whose desktop machine is moreprimitive than a 386 or 386SX is still living in the Stone Age.andP;  But in theportables arena, our respondents report that machines using 8086/8088processors still get the job done.andP;  Not only do far more users report usingthese systems, but these are deemed a tad more reliable than their speedier286 and 386/ 386SX counterparts.andP;  That's impressive if you consider that,unsurprisingly, they have been used 8 to 11 months longer than the average286 or 386/386SX.andP;  While respondents may sometimes wish for more-powerfulsystems, for many nothing has come along with enough of the rightfeatures-low weight and long battery life-to replace their old standbys.andM;Curiously, despite the 8086/8088 machines' broad appeal, users of 386/ 386SXsystems lead the way in reporting that they would buy from the samemanufacturers again.andP;  While 79 percent of 8086/ 8088 users and 81 percent of286 owners respond yes to this question, a full 84 percent of 386/386SX userswould not hesitate before making out a check for another product from thesame company.andP;  Apparently, the last group's characteristically greater speed,better video capabilities, and higher hard disk capacities make an impressionthat is most likely to keep users coming back for more.andM;And what about 286-based portables? On the average, we find, they are sharedamong three users, compared with the two users who generally share an8086/8088 or 386/386SX system.andP;  While they tie with 386 and SX machines interms of reliability, the 286s do have a greater overall problem incidencethan either of the other categories.andP;  SPEAKING OF PROBLEMS Problems for8086/8088- and 286-based machines are rated as less severe than the problemsthat occur in 386/386SX-based systems.andP;  But as with any electronic equipment,any number of things can go wrong with your portable system, no matter whatprocessor it uses.andP;  Since you'll probably be moving your machine around alot, you should be prepared for both minor and major disasters-anything froma hard disk crashing to a floppy disk drive getting thrown out of alignmentto a battery losing some of the kick it used to have.andP;  You'll find usefulinformation on how to combat or even avoid these troubles in the sidebar&quot;Portable Perils: Time, Space, and Gravity.&quot;andM;In our survey, 61 percent of our respondents have experienced no problems;the others generally deem the most serious to be screen-related occurrences.andO;While displays are one of the more delicate components, prey to fading fromheat and prone to developing bad bits in the video memory chips, batteriesand hard disks tie for second place in the problem department.andP;  Yet the smallpercentage of respondents reporting that they had any problems at allindicates how far the industry has come in improving shockmounting techniquesand in making portables and their accessories more durable.andP;  WHEN THINGS GOWRONG Our survey shows that users usually turn either to the manufacturer orto their retailer for technical support-which essentially means foradvice-and to either of these sources or to their own wits for repair jobs.andO;In our respondents' eyes, some manufacturers and retailers ought to spiff uptheir tech support services a bit.andP;  The average level of satisfaction withmanufacturers' tech support is only 57 out of a possible 100 points (where100 means very satisfied); overall satisfaction with retailer tech support is58.andM;Of course, some provide better tech support than others; the leaders includeEpson and Sharp retailers, Datavue, GRID Systems, and even IBM (via directservice contracts and possibly through sources like IBM Service Centers orthe now-defunct IBM Product Centers).andP;  But our respondents also think that,among others, IBM retailers, Mitsubishi retailers, and Sharp itself don't doas well as they should in providing tech support.andM;As for repair services, outstanding performers include GRID Systems and IBM,while users suggest that both Mitsubishi and its retailers, NEC's retailers,and Zenith Data Systems, among others, ought to polish their act.andP;  Compaq'slow ratings are not surprising, as it doesn't offer any service directly-noteven to large corporate accounts.andP;  Respondents who have been able to performrepairs themselves seem happiest, giving themselves an 82 score forsatisfaction with their own handiwork.andM;Note that in most cases the users have bad no extraordinary problems withtheir machines.andP;  Rather, the respondents' wide-ranging complaints indicatethat add-on items are too expensive, or that the companies have failed to letcustomers know about upgrades, or that even satisfied users live in dread ofanything going wrong, based on what they have seen of retailers.andP;  Some of thestrongest comments center around manufacturers such as Sharp who have notonly discontinued an item but discontinued their support of it.andP;  Even when amodel like the IBM Convertible is still officially supported, users have hadlong waits to get the equipment they need.andP;  (In this instance, IBM does makesupplies available but admits that since the machines have been discontinued,getting equipment to dealers could be more difficult.) THE SATISFIED Whoamong the companies represented here wins the hearts and minds of its usersthe most? Toshiba, with an overwhelming total of 1,076 responses, seems tohold the cards: 87 percent of the users we've heard from say they wouldpurchase a system from the company again, and that's a good 10 percentagepoints above the average.andP;  T1000 users are a particularly contented lot, with89 percent reporting that they would buy from Toshiba again.andP;  The company'soverall reliability rating is a generous 90, and again the T1000-A perennialfavorite-wins big, with a reliability score of 94.andM;As for Compaq, almost everyone has probably sat through some sort ofpresentation presided over by one of the models in the imposing Portableline.andP;  It takes second place, with 83 percent of the users reporting thatthey would buy from the company again.andP;  In the realm of manufacturers withsmall user bases, Epson boasts an 80 percent score for the number who wouldbuy from the company again.andM;The detailed analyses that follow will clue you in on what to expect not onlyfrom the systems but from the companies themselves, particularly in the areaof service and support.andP;  Along with the lamentations of users whose hopes fora happy coexistence with their portables were dashed to the ground, you willfind the ecstatic exclamations of those who have made near-perfect matcheswith the luggables of their choice.andP;  Respondents write in with awe andappreciation of systems that have survived drops to the floor, trips acrossthe world, being struck by lightning (admittedly, there was some damage tothat particular machine, but it was quickly repaired), and-perhaps worst ofall-rides on the New York City subway system.andP;  And others are simplyimpressed by the faithful performance of an old companion: maybe not thecomputer version of a Rolex with all the fancy trimmings, but just a simpleTimex that keeps on ticking.andM;Of course, any and all of the respondents might still be interested in theultimate portable-you know, a battery-operated 386 complete with a color VGAscreen and weighing under 5 pounds.andP;  If the companies that have user loyaltynow know what's good for them, they'll be working hard to develop it.andP;  Out ofthe twelve companies included in our survey of portable computermanufacturers, seven had the requisite 75 or more responses from which wecould draw valid conclusions.andP;  The results show that Toshiba takes the leadin satisfying user expectations sufficiently that they would buy from thecompany again.andP;  Its systems are just edged out by Tandy in terms ofreliability, but apparently people want something more than a machine thatmerely avoids causing problems; Tandy doesn't come anywhere near Toshiba onthe &quot;buy again&quot; scale.andP;  For quality of technical support, Toshiba again takesthe lead in meeting users' needs.andM;Toshiba's strong showings in the &quot;buy again,&quot; reliability, and technicalsupport areas are even more impressive when you consider that it leads thecompetition by far in the number of respondents who report using itsproducts: 1,027.andP;  Its closest runner-up is Zenith, with 683 respondentsclaiming that they use the company's systems.andM;Compaq, whose line of Portables have long been a fixture at productpresentations across the country, also does well in terms of buyer loyalty,with 83 percent of its users saying that they would buy from the companyagain.andP;  Its generally higher-priced systems also garner high scores forreliability, backing up the old adage that you do get what you pay for.andM;IBM and Sharp form a pair in two out of the four contests, scoring identicalmarks for reliability and repeat purchases.andP;  They also link up closely whenit comes to repairs, although Big Blue takes first prize in this instance.andM;NEC hovers near the top in only one respect, but an important one: thepercentage of users who would buy from the same company again.andP;  As forZenith, its large number of users are not necessarily the happiest: thecompany ties with NEC for bottom scores in reliability, takes second-to-lastplace for the percentage of users who would buy one again, and comes in deadlast for repair satisfaction.andP;  This 3-D bar chart gives you the chance tocompare at a glance the company scores for four questions: * How would yourate the product for overall reliability? * Would you buy a product from thesame manufacturer again? * How satisfied were you with the technical supportyou received? 2 How satisfied were you with the repair service you received?andM;The first question and the last two call on respondents to give a ratedresponse based on a scale of 1 to 5, which we converted to a more familiar 1to 100.andP;  For the second question, though, each result indicates thepercentage of respondents who answer yes.andP;  Note that answers to the first twoquestions come from all those responding for a given company.andP;  For the lasttwo questions, however, those answering are a subset of the totalrespondents-only those persons who tried tech support or had a repairproblem.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
