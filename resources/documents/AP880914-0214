Michael Dukakis stressed support for some weapons andmuted earlier opposition to others as he sought to blunt attacks onhis defense credentials.   Bush also touted smaller than expected trade deficit figures andDukakis accused the Republicans of opposing ``every single effort''to reform the Pentagon, while their managers fleshed out details onthe campaign debates that are expected to be pivotal in the closerace for the White House.   Officials said that vice presidential candidates Dan Quayle andLloyd Bentsen would hold their only debate of the fall on Oct. 5 inOmaha, Neb. Los Angeles was fixed as the site of the second andfinal Bush-Dukakis debate on either Oct. 13 or 14.   The two contenders for the White House square off a week fromSunday in Winston-Salem, N.C., in their first debate of thecampaign.   Said Bush, ``I've been looking forward to it.''   But Dukakis went to Annapolis, Md., which was to have hosted adebate Wednesday night, and taunted the vice president for hisrefusal to make it a date. ``If George Bush isn't ready today afterseven and a half years as vice president of this country, how canwe expect him to be ready on Jan. 20, 1989?'' the Democrat said.   Public opinion polls in recent days have shown Bush holding asingle-digit lead, and Democratic aides said privately they didn'tlook for much change in the 10 days before the debates begin.   However, a Washington Post-ABC News released Wednesday showedthe two candidates essentially tied, with Dukakis leading 48-45.The survey of 1,092 likely voters had a three-point margin oferror. The survey concluded two days after the recent surveys.   The vice president said some polls were good and others weren't.``They cancel out.''   And he did, wooing Hispanic and Asian voters in a tour ofCalifornia, the biggest prize with 47 electoral votes. The vicepresident said joblessness among Hispanics has fallen almost twiceas fast under President Reagan as when the Democrats were in theWhite House.   Bush said there was ``new pride in America'' demonstrated by theperformance of a flag-making company in New Jersey.   Under the Democratic administration of Jimmy Carter, he said,``They weren't selling that well.''   ``Well, since we began restoring pride in the United States ofAmerica, business has been booming,'' he said, without naming thecompany.   Later, Bush said he opposed a grape boycott being led by farmworkers union official Cesar Chavez and said that was a bigdifference between himself and the ``liberal governor ofMassachusetts.''   Standing in a field in the San Joaquin Valley, surrounded byfruit crates, Bush noted figures showing that the trade deficitfell to a smaller than expected $9.53 billion in July. ``We aremoving in the right direction,'' he said.   Capping the day in San Francisco, Bush was feted at a colorfulrally in a Chinatown park, but about 400 demonstrators gathered inUnion Square across the luxury St. Francis hotel where he was todeliver a speech.   At one point before Bush arrived, protesters began spilling outinto the street, crossing barricades, stopping traffic and thecity's famed cable cars. Police led several away and at least oneperson arrested.   Dukakis supporters passed out anti-Bush fortune cookies inChinatown, but Bush's hosts countered with a huge fortune cookiecontaining the message, ``November brings good fortune.''   ``Only one person _ only one person can carry America's peaceand prosperity into the 1990s,'' Bush said, describing himself asthat person.   Reagan added a few well-aimed barbs at the Democrats during theday, when he said the opposition was to blame for ``economic andforeign policy nightmares.''   ``The truth is that when you take a walk down our opposition'smemory lane, it starts to look like `Nightmare on Elm Street,'''the president said on a campaign trip to Missouri.   The Massachusetts governor, portrayed by Bush as weak on defensematters, said in a speech at Georgetown University in Washingtonthat he would use force ``when it's necessary to protect ourterritory, our citizens or our vital interests, to meet our treatycommitments and to deter or to respond to terrorist attacks.''   He offered no specifics, nor did he reply to Bush's challenge _repeated during the day in California _ to say whether he favoredthe U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983 or the bombing of Libya in1985.   Dukakis listed the Stealth bomber, the Trident II sea-basedmissile, the advanced cruise missile, the Advanced TacticalFighter, a new attack submarine and a new anti-tank weapon assystems he favors. He criticized the MX missile, which Bush favors,as a ``smoke and mirrors'' proposal.   His speech also reflected the softening in his earlier adamantopposition to the proposed Star Wars space-based defense shield. Herepeated his statement from last week that he wants $1 billion ayear for continued research and would consider deploying the systemunder some circumstances.   Dukakis has opposed the Midgetman missile in the past, but inhis speech said ``the strategic concept...is sound but I questionthe value of spending $40 billion or $50 billion for 500 land-basedmissile warheads.''   Dukakis also charged the Reagan administration with neglectingconventional weapons, and Bentsen sounded a similar theme as hedonned a leather flight jacket and fired up a single-engine trainerat an airplane museum.   ``Under this administration, Buck Rogers has been promoted andour conventional forces have been neglected,'' said Bentsen, whowas a World War II bomber pilot.   Quayle toured the NORAD missile warning center in CheyenneMountain near Colorado Springs, Colo., and later strongly defendedthe Star Wars program as a ``moral, superior way of defendingAmerica.''</TEXT></DOC>
