Another element of the plan that is taking shape,according to U.S. and Saudi officials, is to possibly createa permanent international peace-keeping force in order todeter Iraqi aggression in the future.</LP><TEXT>   Details of the new strategy are still being debated amongtop military and government officials here, though a seniorSaudi general described the broad goals of the initiativeduring a news conference yesterday.   Lt. Gen. Khalid bin Sultan, commander of the Saudi-Arabforces deployed nearest the Kuwaiti border, said thelong-term priority is &quot;to make sure the security of SaudiArabia will be guaranteed now and into the future.&quot;   While he played down the likelihood of a permanent,large-scale U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia, Gen.Khalid stressed that his country &quot;will have to have moreweapons to use&quot; to avoid another such crisis. &quot;There's lotsof discussion with the U.S. and other countries . . . abouthow to strengthen our forces,&quot; he said, adding pointedly:&quot;The lesson is learned.&quot;   No matter how the crisis is resolved, some Saudi leadersbelieve it is important to have at least a small tripwire ofArab forces remaining in Saudi Arabia to ensure against Iraqiaggression. But the size of such a proposed force and whowould command it are still under review, and the finalproposal may not be made for some time.   The Saudi wish list for weapons includes F-15 Eagle jetfighters, M-1 tanks and Bradley armored vehicles, allequipment that U.S. forces brought with them to defend thekingdom. In fact, one Saudi official said, the U.S. probablywill be asked to sell a portion of the equipment already onthe ground here to avoid the cost and delay of shipping newweapons from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia.   Saudi officials have been quietly urging Defense SecretaryDick Cheney and other Bush administration officials toapprove major weapons sales quickly, although it isn't clearwhether the Saudis want the most sophisticated F-15e modeljet fighters or even whether any formal request for armssales has been given to the White House.   Meanwhile, congressional sources told the Associated Pressthat the U.S. will sell nearly $3 billion in new weapons toSaudi Arabia, including 24 F-15 fighter planes and 150 M-60tanks. The sale is designed to strengthen Saudi defenses, andfurther sales are possible, according to the sources.   The issue is bound to create friction with Israel, whichis concerned about the total size of the Saudi air force andespecially the long-range, precision ground attackcapabilities of the F-15e, which is built by McDonnellDouglas Corp.   Without giving specifics, Gen. Khalid told reporters thatSaudi forces &quot;are capable of handling any kind of weapon.&quot;   Before meeting with King Fahd last week, Secretary Cheneysaid the U.S. wasn't considering selling F-15e fighters toSaudi Arabia. But other Pentagon officials have suggestedthat policy could change over the next few weeks or months ifthe Saudis maintain they need the planes to protect theircountry and free some U.S. forces to return home.   Eventually, the Saudi plan envisions that nearly all U.S.troops will depart and that the country's 66,000-man armedforces will increase sharply. Saudi Arabia currently spendsabout one-third of its budget on its military.   Nearly a month after American forces began to arrive, theU.S. and Saudi governments still haven't agreed on adetailed, binding agreement spelling out the relationshipbetween their forces. Soldiers from Morocco, Egypt andseveral other Arab and Islamic countries are under the directcommand of Gen. Khalid, but U.S. forces aren't.   To some extent, however, Saudi leaders such as Gen.Khalid, a close relative of King Fahd, appear to be arestraining influence on the U.S. military response to Iraq.During the news conference, the general stressed that thebuildup of U.S. firepower was intended primarily to protectSaudi oil reserves. &quot;We are here to prevent war,&quot; he said. Ifany offensive action against Iraq is launched from Saudisoil, Gen. Khalid said, &quot;I know for a fact it has to beconsulted between King Fahd and President Bush.&quot;   Even when Saudis step up their rhetoric against Iraq, theyoften go out of their way to emphasize that diplomaticefforts are on the front burner.   &quot;I believe that Saddam Hussein will be destroyed unless hecomes to his senses,&quot; withdraws from Kuwait, and restores theroyal family to power, Gen. Khalid said in his first newsconference with Western reporters. But almost in the samebreath, he added: &quot;We have to give the diplomats' efforts achance to work.&quot;   ---   John J.
