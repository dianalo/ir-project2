A three-dimensional, two-phase-flownumerical code was developed to simulate a natural gas storage fieldto determine mixing of the natural gas with an inert gas. The code isapplicable for a dry-gas storage field as well as an aquifer storagefield. The inert-gas-mixing simulations indicated excellent retentionof inert gas in the field. The rate and duration of the injection/Withdrawalcycle (i.e., the amount of gas withdrawn in a single cycle) was foundto be the most dominating factor in determining the concentration profilesand the rate of loss of inert gas. The experimental studies, conductedat North Carolina State University facilities, indicated the overallgas-phase dispersion coefficient to be of the same order as moleculardiffusion. The numerical predictions were compared successfully againstcontrolled experimental data on mixing between two gases in a porousmedium.</TEXT></DOC>
