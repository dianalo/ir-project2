BERGSTROM</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Car sales weakened but stronger light truckbuying topped period sales records for some manufacturers in earlyJuly.   Jeep vehicles and Ford light trucks roared to new sales peaks,makers said in reporting sales figures Wednesday for the July 1-10period.   Industrywide, domestic light truck sales climbed 8.6 percent ona daily average, compared with overall 1.6 percent decline in dailysales of U.S. made cars.   Combined car and light truck sales totaled 228,870 for the sevensales days in the July 1-10 period, and combined sales were up 2percent on a daily basis from the comparable 1987 period, whichcontained eight days.   Chrysler Corp. sold 21,700 cars in the early July period, for a12.2 percent increase in daily sales. But General Motors Corp.'ssales of 66,737 cars and Ford Motor Co.'s sales of 41,436 vehiclesboth represented 5.8 percent declines.   David Healy, automotive analyst with Drexel Burnham LambertInc., said the slowed sales did not represent a significant change.``I think sales are just bouncing around, reflecting the timing ofincentives,'' he said.   General Motors and Ford recently cut back on buyer incentives.Chrysler had said its current campaign would expire Tuesday, thenannounced a new, slightly smaller package that day.   ``There may have been some people in there buying because theythought the incentives were about to end,'' said Chrysler spokesmanTom Houston.   Ray Windecker, an analyst at Ford, said the timing of incentivespushed Ford's car sales up in late June with a resulting early Julyfallback.   But car sales may continue tapering off, because makers are notoversupplied and will have no reason to offer the ``fire sale''style incentives of August and September of 1986 and 1987, saidChris Cedergren, analyst at J.D. Power andamp; Associates in AgouraHills, Calif.   In contrast, Ford's sales of 30,869 light trucks, an average of4,410 a day, broke a July 1-10 record rate of 4,312, set in 1973when a dealer incentive program concluded on July 10, Windeckersaid.   And Chrysler said sales of 5,110 Jeep vehicles surpassed the4,944 units of the best previous July 1-10 period for Jeeps, in1986.   Among foreign companies making cars domestically, Honda MotorCo. led with sales of 9,715 U.S.-made cars, an 18.1 percent surgein daily sales from a year earlier.   Daily sales fell by 2.7 percent at Nissan Motor Corp., whichsold 1,412 U.S. made cars during the period. Toyota Motor Corp.sold 829 U.S.-produced cars, up from 665 in the year earlier period.   Volkswagen of America, ceasing production today at itsWestmoreland, Pa., plant, stopped reporting domestically producedautos separately from its German imports. Imported car sales arereported at the end of each month.</TEXT></DOC>
