Sunday, it did not disappoint.;    Alongside thecorseted Camp walked friend Gary Knapp, 25, who also showed more than hismettle in a pale pink corset and white fish-net hose.;    &quot;It's my first timein drag at the parade. I always wanted to do this,&quot; said Knapp, who marchedunder the name of Velveeta Cheese. &quot;This is just my way of expressing myself.It's just so wonderful that in such a city as San Francisco people can do thisand express themselves freely.&quot;;    Leather and lace abounded. There were dragqueens in corsets, women in stick-on decals and people of both genders whoappeared to be wearing almost nothing but body paint.;    Most of thespectators dressed tamely in shorts and shirts, soaking up the rarity of asunny day in June, although there were a few men wearing T-shirts that read,&quot;Nobody knows I'm a lesbian.&quot; Many wore pink clothes or pink triangle pins.;   The parade began with the full-throttled roar of hundreds of motorcycles asthe &quot;Dykes on Bikes&quot; took their traditional place at the front of the line.;   From there, the parade moved slowly as members of ACT UP and others took uppositions in front of the car carrying Mayor Art Agnos and began stagingsporadic protests, lying down on the ground to commemorate those who have diedof AIDS.;    Organizers said they were trying to stop the parade every sevenminutes, citing a statistic that someone dies of AIDS every seven minutes.;   Shouting, &quot;Act up; Fight back; Fight AIDS,&quot; and &quot;Needle exchange now,&quot; somebrandished outsized syringes as they called for the mayor to legalize programsin which dirty needles can be exchanged for new ones.;    Agnos has said hefavors needle exchange but that the city has no authority to decriminalizeit.;    Parade monitors stepped in between the protesters and a contingent ofAgnos supporters, but the procession went on smoothly, albeit slowly, as Agnossmiled and waved at spectators.;    About four hours after it started, theparade had still not reached its finish, but Agnos stopped to speak briefly tothe crowd.;    &quot;This is a happy, great day for all of us in San Francisco,&quot; hesaid.;    Also appearing were Police Chief Willis Casey, who was escorted byabout two dozen gay police officers.;    &quot;It's a lot more festive this year,definitely,&quot; said parade spokeswoman Tammy Goda. &quot;I attribute that to the factthat . . . a lot of people are bonding together.&quot;;    On the lighter side, astandout among the better dressed was Glynda, the Sandwich of the Southeast.;   &quot;You can be a good witch or a bad witch. I'm a sandwich,&quot; said Glynda, whogave his name as Lyme de Vries and said he flew in from Florida for the event.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910701  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  643  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 1, 199100183200,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
