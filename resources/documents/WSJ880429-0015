In the fourth quarter, import prices rose 1.6%, although the dollar fell 5.7%.    A falling dollar is supposed to make U.S. imports more expensive, decreasing demand for them. But some foreign producers have been slow to adjust prices to reflect the decline in the dollar, contributing to the persistent growth in U.S. imports. In the past 12 months, import prices have climbed 7.1%, while the dollar has fallen 9.9%.    Even after adjusting for price changes, imports grew at an annual rate of 6.2% in the first quarter, according to a Commerce Department estimate earlier in the week. Exports were up 16.5%, however, and the inflation-adjusted trade deficit shrank by 7.9%. Clayton Yeutter, the U.S. trade representative, said yesterday that after adjusting for price changes, &quot;the trade deficit is now at its lowest level since the third quarter of 1985.&quot;    The Labor Department said the price of imports excluding energy was up 2.3% in the first quarter on top of a 3.0% rise in the fourth quarter. The prices of machinery and transportation equipment, which account for nearly half of all U.S. imports, rose 1.7% after climbing 2.7% in the fourth quarter.    Export prices were up 1.4% in the first quarter. They rose 2% in the fourth quarter. Export prices have risen 6.5% since March 1987.    The figures aren't adjusted for seasonal variations. </TEXT></DOC>
