By seeking shallow, relatively low temperatures(andless; 750 m, 120{sup 0}-150{sup 0}C) geothermal reservoirs, explorationexpenditures and risks can be reduced, and exploration and developmentdrilling can be accomplished with truck-mounted rotary rigs suitablefor the island infrastructure. Experience over the past decade with small,modular, binary (Rankine) cycle generating units indicates that geothermalenergy can provide a reliable source of baseload electricity in the amountsrequired at a cost that is competitive with alternative energy sources.Development of these resources can provide ideal additions to the energysources of many of these Pacific island nations within the frameworkof their island economies.</TEXT></DOC>
