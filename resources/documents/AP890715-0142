Members of TWA's frequent flier program are being notified of thenew policy in a mailing now under way, The New York Times reportedin Sunday's editions.   The airline had required people who earned free tickets to usethe tickets themselves or transfer them to relatives, in an attemptto prevent people from selling or bartering tickets.   The airline was sued in federal court by lawyers from the LambdaLegal Defense and Education Fund in May, charging discrimination.   ``What we have now done is to expand the policy so that virtuallyany frequent flier can travel with any companion of theirchoosing,'' said Mark Buckstein, the airline's general counsel. ``Wefelt our rules had probably been unduly restrictive.''   Gay groups said TWA was the last major airline to drop itslimiting policy, the Times reported.   The lawsuit, tentatively settled, said William L. Johnson, a NewYork lawyer, was denied a ticket in July 1988 for his live-incompanion of seven years. His lawyer, Evan Wolfson, would notdisclose terms of the settlement. Airline officials said thesettlement wasn't final.   ``When TWA was forced to pay attention to what it was doing, theyrealized it was bad business and they changed it,'' Wolfson said.         ws times</TEXT></DOC>
