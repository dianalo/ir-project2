The decision to pull the ad comes as the project begins a 25-showtest amid complaints from some educators that it is inappropriate toallow television advertisements in their classrooms.   The 30-second Levi's ad, which has aired on commercialtelevision, shows a montage of scenes with young people, including aboys' choir, several youngsters dancing and a romantic couplewalking away together.   Robin Oden, principal at Mumford High School in Detroit, saidWednesaday that four of the eight people he instructed to review theprogram before it was aired in classrooms Monday felt the Levi's adwas sexually suggestive.   Oden said that although he had the choice of not running theprogram, he ran it anyway because it was the first day of the testand a big media contingent was on hand to write about it.   But he said he told officials of Whittle Communications, theKnoxville, Tenn.-based media concern that developed Channel One, hewouldn't air the ad any more.   Bill Gubbins, a Whittle official who was in Detroit that day,said he assured Oden the ad would not be repeated.   ``This is a test and one of the things we are learning about ishow broad or how narrow the sensitivities are going to be in theindividual schools,'' he said. ``We wanted to make sure they felttheir concerns were being addressed.''   Dan Chew, marketing manager at Levi Strauss andamp; Co. in SanFrancisco, said Wednesday his company and its ad agency werenotified there was a problem with the ad. He said it is one of fourcommercials the company planned to rotate through shows during thetest.   ``We have made no changes to that plan. We've heard nothing fromanyone about it, and until that request comes in formally, we willstick with our schedule,'' he said.   Levi Strauss is one of eight advertisers signed up for the test.Others are Procter andamp; Gamble Co.'s Head andamp; Shoulders shampoo, WrigleyCo.'s gum, Warner-Lambert Co.'s breath mints and Gillette Co.'sshaving products.   Sara Fortune, a spokesman for Whittle, said she was unaware ofany other complaints from test schools about the ads.   Whittle has given each school $50,000 in televisions, videorecording equipment and a satellite dish to receive the 12-minutenews program each day. Each show will contain up to two minutes ofadvertising.   In exchange, the schools are asked to show the program once eachschool day.   Several education groups, including the National Parent-TeacherAssociation and the National Association of Secondary SchoolPrincipals, denounced the commercials, calling them an unwarrantedintrusion by business into the schools.   But students and teachers who have seen the program expressed fewreservations about the ads and said they liked a news show targetedto teens. Oden himself said that even though he wasn't happy withthe Levi's commercial, he was pleased with the first three shows.   ``The information they give to the kids is outstanding. Thestudents have told me, `This news show is not boring.' That's thegeneral feeling the youngsters have about watching the program,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
