The study was sponsored by New York-based International Investors Inc., the nation's largest gold-oriented mutual fund. A pending House bill would bar Americans from buying, owning or holding any investment in South Africa.    At year end, U.S. investors held about 14% of all South African mining shares outstanding, with a market value then of more than $4.5 billion, Wharton said; more than $3.2 billion of that amount was in gold mining shares. If the U.S. gold-share holdings were to be sold within six months, Wharton said, &quot;U.S. owners of South African shares are likely to suffer a one-time loss of $1.2 billion.&quot;    Gerald Godshaw, who wrote the study, noted that though it covered only the gold mining industry, U.S. investors would face other large losses in shares of platinum and diamond companies. Investors also might suffer from changes in exchange rates that could stem from sudden dumping of shares on the market, Mr. Godshaw said. </TEXT></DOC>
