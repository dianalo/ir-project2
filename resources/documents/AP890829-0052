(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 200 people smashed windows, lootedstores and battled in the streets early today after a protest overthe shooting death of a young black man by police.   More than 30 people were arrested and at least one person washospitalized, police said.   About 100 state and local police officers in riot gear battled toregain control of the streets after about 40 buildings were damagedalong about a one-mile stretch of a downtown street.   Order was restored about 4 a.m., police said. The trouble beganaround 11 p.m. Monday.   ``Things are out of hand,'' Vineland police Lt. Ed Zatzariny saidearlier. ``They're going crazy to retaliate for the shooting.''   The disturbance was preceded by a march on the police station byabout 100 demonstrators who chanted ``We want justice.''   Zatzariny said that crowd dispersed, but a few hours laterseparate groups of blacks and Hispanics began forming in variousparts of the city and converged on Landis Avenue, the main drag ofthe mostly white downtown section of Vineland, a city of about54,000 about 35 miles south of Philadelphia.   The group, estimated by Zatzariny at 200, began throwing rocksand bottles at cars and storefront windows.   ``There was extensive damage to stores,'' the lieutenant said.``Windows were knocked out of a few police cars and a lot ofcivilian cars were smashed up pretty good.''   Gary Vasell, a manager of a Seven-Eleven convenience store onLandis Avenue, said he barely escaped injury.   ``I was looking through the window and all of a sudden brickscame flying through,'' Vasell said. ``I started to run out the doorand then more bricks came flying through so I just backed up andcalled the cops. I thought maybe somebody was going to start firingshots. I thought I was going to die.''   Smaller groups took to sidestreets and caused more damage,Zatzariny said.   Several residents in the area scuffled with vandals and somemembers of the packs fought with each other, he said.   The victim of the shooting, Samuel Williams, 26, was killedSunday by a white police officer, Paul Letizia, after Williamsreportedly threatened Letizia with a steel rod, police Chief JosephP. Cassisi said.   Officers spotted Williams on Sunday after receiving an anonymouscall about a man on a bicycle carrying drugs, Cassisi said. Williamshad pending arrest warrants on drug and weapon charges, he said.   Williams allegedly threw two rocks at Letizia when the officertold him he was under arrest, Cassisi said. He then picked up therod and started toward the officer, swinging, Cassisi said.   ``He threatened to kill the officer,'' Cassisi said, ``Theofficer was in fear of his life.''   The results of an autopsy are still out.   Samuel L. Clark, president of the Cumberland County chapter ofthe NAACP, said Monday's march was prompted by a report in The DailyJournal of Vineland that quoted Cassisi as saying, ``It was ajustifiable shooting.''   ``When the newspaper hit the street, all hell broke loose,'' saidClark. ``We're trying to defuse a very volatile situation.''   Clark said the city's young officers long have used excessiveforce and made racist remarks.   Vineland's police force, with about 100 officers, has only oneblack, Cassisi said.</TEXT></DOC>
