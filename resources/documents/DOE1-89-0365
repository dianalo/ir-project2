<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-89-0365 </DOCNO><TEXT>The mass production technique for sour-gas line pipes was established.The lower C was desirable from the viewpoints of field weldability, lowtemperature toughness, and HIC resistance but 0.04%C was the limit dueto the low yield ratio. The 1.2% or less Mn was desirable because Mndeteriorated the HIC resistance. Cu and Ni were effective in preventinghydrogen intrusion and diffusion and to improve the strength. Sulfidewas controlled by Ca addition and further the double refining processwas developed to reduce P segregation and to prevent HIC propagation,Furthermore, the new continuous casting technique was developed to reducecenter segregation and accumulation of nonmetallic inclusions which causedthe HIC starting points and propagation pathes. The thermomechanicaltreatment and accelerated cooling processes for the heavy plates weredeveloped to control the structure, resulting the higher strength, betterfield weldability and improvement of HIC resistance. The newly developedsour-gas service line pipes of 26,000 tons which had better characteristicswere produced for the North Sea. (15 figs, 1 tab, 18 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
