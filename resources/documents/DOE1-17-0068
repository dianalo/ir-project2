Subconfluent HA-1(Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells were made quiescent by 24 hour incubationin serum-free media. Quiescent cells were stimulated with either serumor the growth factors FGF, insulin, and transferrin. DNA synthesis wasmeasured by /sup 3/H-thymidine incorporation. Twenty-four hour incubationin serum-free media did not sensitize HA-1 cells to heat. Survival after45{sup 0}C heating was similar to survival of exponentially growing cells.The mitogenic response to serum and growth factors was assayed after45{sup 0}C heating. This correlated well with survival. Preliminary experimentsusing flow cytometry indicated that clonogenically live cells could bestimulated to progress from G/sub 1/ to G/sub 2/ whereas clonogenicallydead (but metabolically alive) cells could not be stimulated.</TEXT></DOC>
