Agencies requiring the validation of language processorscompilers may specify their own testing for conformance, or adopt othertechniques for evaluating conformance.No changes are planned for current requirements for validation of languageprocessors for the following languages: FIPS PUB 21-2, COBOL; FIPS PUB69-2, Fortran, and FIPS PUB 119, Ada. The NIST will continue to conductvalidation tests for language processors implementing these standards.The NIST also plans to support validation of language processors for theprogramming language C when a FIPS for that language is issued.Prior to final action to remove the requirements for validation of languageprocessors for FIPS PUBS 68-2, 109, and 125, it is essential to assurethat consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, thepublic, and State and local governments. The purpose of this notice isto solicit such views.Interested parties may obtain copies of FIPS PUBS 68-2, 109, and 125 fromthe National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,Springfield, VA 22161.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>date:</T2> Comments on this proposed change must be received on orbefore April 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address:</T2> Written comments concerning this change should be sentto: National Institute of Standards and Technology, ATTN: Validation ofFIPS Programming Language Processors, Technology Building, Room B154, Gaithersburg,MD 20899.Written comments received in response to this notice will be made partof the public record and will be made available for inspection and copyingin the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6628, HerbertC.
