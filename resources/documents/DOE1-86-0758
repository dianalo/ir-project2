Optimal conditions of sorption are revealed as wellas the effect of chemicl nature and concentration of eluents under studyon hafbium (4) desorption efficiency. The results obtained show promisefor using EDTA-forms of anionites to develop chromatographic methodsof Hf (4) concentrating and its separation from accessory metal ions.</TEXT></DOC>
