The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory action tothe scale of businesses subject to such action in order that small businesseswill not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. The majority of producersand handlers under the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act may becharacterized as small entities. The Egg Research and Promotion Order (7 CFR Part 1250) authorizes AEB tocollect assessments at the rate of 5 cents per 30-dozen case of commercialeggs marketed or the equivalent thereof. However, effective September 1,1987, the 5-cent rate of assessment was decreased to 2.5 cents by revisingthe Egg Research and Promotion Rules and Regulations in andSection;1250.514(7 CFR 1250.514). AEB collects approximately $3.7 million annually fromthe 2.5-cent assessment. The assessment is refundable upon demand and presentlyis at the rate of 43 percent of assessments collected. According to AEBstatistics, 1,967 producers pay assessments under the amended Rules andRegulations. Approximately 79 percent of such producers currently do notrequest refunds; therefore, the implementation of a mandatory assessmentwould have no additional impact on these producers. A mandatory assessment of 2.5 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs would beequivalent to approximately 0.14 percent of the wholesale price of a 1-dozencarton of Large eggs. This is based on the Economic Research Service'slatest annual average wholesale price of 60.6 cents per dozen. The amendmentto the Order would impose additional costs on approximately 21 percentof the producers and any other producers who might request refunds in thefuture. It is estimated that the AEB would collect $3.7 million annuallyfrom a mandatory 2.5-cent assessment. This would represent an increaseof 43 percent over the current amount retained after refunds. It is anticipatedthat any additional costs will be offset by the benefits derived from strengthenedresearch and promotion programs as a result of participation by all producers.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction</ITAG>There is no change in the reporting or recordkeeping requirements imposedon producers and handlers as a result of this action. The Office of Managementand Budget approval of these requirements (No. 0581-0098) was renewed foruse through August 31, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Egg Research and Promotion Order in andSection; 1250.349 [7 CFR andSection;1250.349] currently provides that any producer, whose eggs are assessedunder authority of the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C.2701-2718) and who is not in favor of supporting the programs authorizedthereunder, may request refunds of such assessments. The Egg Research andConsumer Information Act Amendments of 1988 (Pub. Law 100-575, effectiveOctober 31, 1988) require the Secretary to amend the Egg Research and PromotionOrder to eliminate the producer refund provision. Such an amendment wouldnot be subject to a producer referendum until after the end of an 18-monthperiod from the effective date of the amendment, January 1, 1989.A poll was conducted by AEB of all commercial egg producers, which disclosedthat 69 percent of producers voting, representing 79 percent of egg productionvoting, were in favor of eliminating refunds of producer assessments.In the House of Representatives' report on the 1988 amendments to the Act(H.R. Rep. No. 1024, 100th Cong. 2nd Sess. 3 (1988)), it was stated thatthe Act, as enacted in 1974, contains many of the tools needed to addressthe issues facing the egg industry today. However, there is not sufficientfunding for an effective program of research, consumer and producer education,advertising, and promotion. The report states further that the hallmarkof an effective and continuous program must be the contribution by allcommercial egg producers of their fair share.The amended Act requires the Secretary to issue an amendment to the Orderto eliminate the refund provision. During the period beginning with theeffective date of the amendment until approval by referendum of the amendment,the Board is required to place into an escrow account 10 percent of theassessments received from egg producers. If the amendment to the Orderis not approved in the referendum, the escrow account will be used to payrefunds to eligible egg producers who requested a refund pursuant to regulationsto be promulgated by the Secretary. If the escrow account does not containsufficient amounts to refund all eligible producers demanding a refund,then the Board will prorate the amount of refunds demanded by eligibleproducers. If the amendment to the Order is approved, the amount in theescrow account will be used by the Board in accord with the purposes setforth in the Act. Sections 1250.336 and 1250.349 are amended accordingly.The 1988 amendments also contain a provision limiting the total costs thatmay be incurred by the Egg Board in collecting producers assessments andfor administrative costs to the amount of the projected total assessmentsto be collected by the AEB as the Secretary determines to be reasonable.Section 1250.336 of the Order is amended to contain such a provision.The interim final rule establishing these changes was published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 4, 1989 [54 FR 98], with an effectivedate of January 1, 1989. Comments were solicited from interested personsthrough February 3, 1989. One comment in support of the rule was receivedduring the comment period. No opposing comments were received. Accordingly,the amendments made by that interim final rule are adopted without change.It is found that this action will tend to effectuate the declared policyof the Act.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found that good cause exists for notpostponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> because: (1) This final rule adopts the provisionsissued January 1, 1989; (2) the Egg Research and Consumer Information ActAmendments of 1988 require that the Secretary make these amendments tothe Order eliminating producer refunds and limiting costs incurred by AEB;(3) interested persons were afforded a 30-day comment period to submitwritten comments_one comment was received; and (4) producers will be affordedan opportunity to vote in a referendum to be conducted at a future date,in accordance with the 1988 amendments.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1250</ITAG>Egg research and promotion.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1250_EGG RESEARCH AND PROMOTION</ITAG>1.
