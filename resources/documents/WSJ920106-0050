Andrew Riley, a contract scientist for the Electric PowerResearch Institute of Palo Alto, Calif., was killed and threescientists were injured in Thursday's blast, a SRI spokesmansaid.</LP><TEXT>   One scientist had lifted a canister containing a hydrogenisotope and a metal out of a water bath and placed it on theside of the bath shortly before the explosion occurred, thespokesman said. &quot;At this time, we and the authorities havestarted to investigate,&quot; he said.   The scientists were studying the interaction between aheavy form of hydrogen called deuterium and a metal,palladium. A much-disputed theory holds that when the twoelements are combined, large amounts of energy may be createdin a process called cold fusion. Three years ago, tworesearchers claimed to have proven the theory, but theirfindings were criticized by other scientists who said theywere unable to duplicate the researchers' results.</TEXT></DOC>
