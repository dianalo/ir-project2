A few Republicans ``have expressed their concern'' to House GOPleader Bob Michel about the $250,000-a-year salary for politicalconsultant Edward Rollins, according to a spokeswoman.   But Rollins' defenders fire back scornfully, reflectinglong-simmering tensions between senior, more moderate HouseRepublicans and younger conservatives who favor confrontationtactics to end their 34-year-old minority status.   ``We have been in the minority since 1954. We have acquired thehabits and strategies of a comfortable minority,'' said Rep. NewtGingrich of Georgia.   Complaints about Rollins' pay are a ``classic example of thedefeatist attitude that says, `Let's only pay enough to get a guywho will keep us in the minority,''' said Gingrich.   Rollins, who ran President Reagan's victorous 1984 campaign andwas at the helm of Jack Kemp's unsuccessful run for the White Housein 1988, is taking over as vice chairman at the National RepublicanCongressional Committee next month. He is bringing with him a smallgroup of aides _ some with close ties to HUD Secretary Kemp _ athefty five-figure salaries.   ``I feel I'm worth it and I hope to prove it to them,'' saidRollins, who is severing his relationship with a Washington lobbyingfirm but will keep two or three outside clients as part of hisfour-year contract with the NRCC, which raises millions of dollarsannually.   Rollins concedes his chances of producing a House GOP majority infour years quite slim, but says he hopes to pave the way forRepublicans to take control later in the decade.   Committee spokesman John Buckley concedes it was poor publicrelations to have word of Rollins' $1 million, four-year contractbecome known virtually the same day lawmakers were loudly votingdown a raise in their own pay.   Rollins was hired after an extensive search in which Rep. GuyVander Jagt of Michigan, the committee chairman, and others kickedaround names including former White House Chief of Staff KenDuberstein and outgoing major league baseball commissioner PeterUeberroth. Michel's spokeswoman Johanna Schneider, said her bosssimply ``wants to make sure that the money's well spent.''   But one senior GOP aide, said Michel has personal misgivings overthe arrangement, and believes it was ``definitely a COS-Kemp cadreinspired thing.'' A group of junior Republicans, operating as theConservative Opportunity Society, has worked in recent years toredefine the party in hopes ot gaining a majority, but not withoutfriction with Michel and others.   This aide, speaking anonymously, said some lawmakers question``whether the money is going to get you a majority,'' and also saythat Rollins and the team he is assembling has sparse experience incongressional campaigns, as opposed to presidential politics.   Rollins says, ``My goal (for 1992) is not a majority. My goal isto be competitive in 218 districts (a majority of 435) and gain amajority in the 90s. Republicans held 192 seats in the Housefollowing former President Reagan's election in 1980, but now hold174.   Rollins said he intends to ``define a very clear message that'sdifferent from the one Republicans have had.''   ``We need to run better candidates and run more effectivecampaigns,'' he added.   He said Democratic congressional candidates have fared welldespite the election successes of Presidents Reagan and Bush bymaking it appear to voters that they were all part of the same teamof government.   ``What we have to do is very carefully peel them away from thepresident,'' he said.   Like the Democrats, Republicans also are planning an effort toinfluence the congressional district reapportionment due to takeplace after the 1990 census in hopes of picking up new seatsexpected to be created in states such as Florida, Texas andCalifornia.   Rollins' team includes Ann Stanley, political director for formerRep. Kemp's president campaign, and spokesman Buckley, another Kempcampaign veteran. Both will receive salaries of $70,000 to $85,000 ayear and envision four-year commitments, Buckley said.   Marc Nuttle, a senior aide in the Rev. Pat Robertson'spresidential campaign, is ``chief of staff for the transition,''according to Buckley, and may very well stay.   Joseph Gaylord, the previous executive director, has a $70,000consultant's contract for one year.   Rollins also is expected to hire several other aides with closerties to Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
