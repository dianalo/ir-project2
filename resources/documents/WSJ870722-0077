The strike by members of the Canadian Paperworkers Union halted production at mills in the Quebec towns of Gatineau, Trois-Rivieres and La Tuque. Another 1,000 paperworkers at a CIP mill in Dalhousie, New Brunswick, were set to go on strike late yesterday. The Gatineau, Trois-Rivieres and Dalhousie mills make newsprint, while the La Tuque facility makes wood pulp.    CIP is a unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd., a transportation and industrial holding concern based in Montreal.    If workers strike the Dalhousie mill, the walkout would affect all of CIP's newsprint capacity, which totals about 1.2 million metric tons a year. Negotiations between the union and the company were continuing.    Edmond Gallant, Quebec vice president for the union and chairman of the union negotiating committee, said the strike is centered on local issues, including vacations, holidays and the union's demand for a ban on contracting out repair and other work to nonunion personnel. Mr. Gallant also said CIP is insisting on the right to operate the mills on four statutory holidays when the facilities currently are closed.    Mr. Gallant said salary and pension clauses already have been settled, along the pattern set by Toronto-based AbitibiPrice Inc., the world's largest newsprint maker, in its pact with 6,000 paperworkers. That pact provides for a 9.3% wage increase over three years. The average wage rate under the previous pact, which expired on April 30, was 14.50 Canadian dollars ($11) an hour.    A CIP spokesman declined to comment on the dispute other than to say that the company had demanded productivity improvements from the union.    CIP is the second big forest products concern in eastern Canada to be hit by a strike in the current round of contract negotiations, which involves a total of 30,000 workers at more than 20 concerns. About 2,500 paperworkers at three Quebec newsprint mills, operated by Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., returned to work July 9 after a 12-day strike over local issues.    Abitibi-Price settled with its employees without a strike. </TEXT></DOC>
