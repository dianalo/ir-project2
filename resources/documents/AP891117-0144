There were also reports that the government, bucking a tide ofpolitical and economic reform in the Soviet bloc, was takingmeasures to prevent any upheaval during the five-day party congressthat begins Monday in Bucharest.   The maverick Ceausescu was the only Warsaw Pact leader to defythe Soviets in the 1960s and 1970s by not permitting joint militaryexercises in his country and by not participating in the Soviet-ledinvasion of Czechoslovakia.   Such independence in foreign policy decisions earned himadmiration in the West, while drawing attention away fromrepression at home, coupled with a personality cult around the``Conducator,'' _ or ``Leader,'' as Ceausescu is called _ that hasbecome unique in Europe.   Now, with democratization reshaping most of the Soviet bloc, itis Ceausescu's steadfast refusal to introduce political andeconomic freedoms that increasingly have isolated him within theWarsaw Pact.   Even hard-line leaders in Czechoslovakia have paid at leastlip-service to the need to introduce some market forces andplurality of opinion to economies and societies directed from thetop.   But the Romanian Communist Party _ totally controlled by itsiron-willed leader _ considers any reform of the Stalinist modeltreasonous.   Romanian diplomats in Vienna said Ceausescu was expected toendorse continuation of the status quo Monday in a keynote speechat the opening of the congress.   The Thursday issue of the party daily Scinteia quoted the71-year old Ceausescu, whose 24 years at the helm of Romania makehim the longest-serving Soviet bloc leader, in comments thatpresaged the tenor of the congress.   In a blanket condemnation of reforms as violating ``the basicprinciples of socialism,'' Ceausescu also accused ``reactionarycircles'' of exploiting confusion in the communist camp.   A Scientia banner headline proclaimed the aim of the congress:``The Re-election of The Most Beloved Son of Our Nation, ComradeNicolae Ceausescu, as Party Leader, a Historic Option of the EntireParty and People.''   Ceausescu's grip on the party means he does not have to fear thekind of overt grassroots discontent that led to the recent ousterof his hard-line East German and Bulgarian counterparts and theirreplacement with reform-minded leaders.   Recent meetings in 40 counties named Ceausescu proteges asdelegates to the congress and nominated his wife, two sons andthree brothers for election or re-election to some of the top partyposts.   But there are signs of fear that opposition could come fromanother quarter _ the military, which is said to be restive afteryears of forced duty in the fields, mines and other civilian areasproducing for export or for the shortage-plagued domestic sector.   A Romanian emigre in West Germany said Thursday a dissidentsource in Bucharest told him of rumors that senior officers hadbeen sent on leave for the duration of the congress, apparently outof fears of a possible coup attempt.   There were unconfirmed reports in 1983 that a group of generalshad tried to topple Ceausescu. The reports were strengthened a fewmonths later by a rash of promotions to generals' ranks.   Romania, which owed foreign banks and governments $11 billion in1981, declared itself debt-free last spring after an acceleratedprogram of producing for export that left store shelves bare,apartments cold, and private cars idled because of gasolinerationing.   Shortages persist, however, as Romania continues to export muchof what it grows or makes, in an attempt to shore up itsconvertable currency supplies. Rationing of energy was announcedearly this month for the sixth winter in a row, while staples suchas meat, butter, white flour, cooking oil and eggs are rationed allyear.   In a rare move, probably provoked by growing restiveness becauseof the catastrophic food shortages, Ceausescu last month touredpoorly stocked markets in Bucharest and promised better supplies.   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also reportedunusally strict security measures in Bucharest.   In the past week, roadblocks were erected on all main roadsleading to Bucharest, with armed officers checking identification,he said.   The main railway station and Otopeni Airport were beingpatrolled by police squads, while the area near the 5,000-seatPalace Hall _ site of the congress _ was declared off limits to allbut residents, who had to show identification.   On the agenda of the congress is approval of a five-yeareconomic plan, as well as the election of the Central Committee,the Politburo and the party leader.</TEXT></DOC>
