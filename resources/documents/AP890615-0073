WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   People in Britain, Ireland, Denmark, theNetherlands and Spain voted today in European Parliament electionsfollowing campaigns dominated by national rather than Europeanissues.   In the other European Economic Community members _ Belgium,France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and West Germany _voting for the 518-member assembly takes place Sunday.   Results in today's elections will not be announced until votinghas ended in the other EEC, or Common Market, countries Sundaynight. The parliament's limited powers include approving tradeagreements involving EEC members.   Throughout the Common Market, 7,126 candidates are vying forseats in the 518-member assembly representing 178 national parties.   Opinion polls predicted the Socialists, with 166 seats, and theChristian Democrats, with 112 seats, would strenghten theirpositions in the elections. Green parties, which favor environmentalcauses, also were expected to win more than the 20 seats they nowhold. These gains would be at the expense of conservatives and theassembly's 16 extreme rightists.   In Ireland _ as in Luxembourg and Greece on Sunday _ voting forthe European Parliament coincides with national elections.   In these nations, the campaigns focused on national issues, suchas unemployment and immigration, rather than European issues, suchas the plan to remove the EEC's internal borders and create a singlemarket EEC by 1992.   Yet that was also evident in nations where no national electionsare immediately in the offing.   In the Netherlands, for example, the campaign was overshadowed byissues facing Dutch voters in the Sept. 6 national elections. TheAmsterdam daily Trouw called voting for the 25 Dutch assembly seats``a dull event.''</TEXT></DOC>
