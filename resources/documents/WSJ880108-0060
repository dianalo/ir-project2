Eight Canadian mineral companies signed the offer to keep prices on potash shipped to the U.S. above levels the Commerce Department earlier found to be unfair, according to a Washington-based lawyer for one of the companies. The Commerce Department won't officially indicate its concurrence until today, but lawyers for both the U.S. producers and the Canadian concerns said the case is as good as settled.    Settlement of the dispute will smooth out a troublesome source of friction in U.S.-Canadian trade. The dispute had a bizarre element in that many of the Canadian companies accused of &quot;dumping,&quot; or selling their products in the U.S. at unfairly low prices, are U.S.-owned.    If the settlement hadn't been reached, the Canadian subsidiary of International Minerals andamp; Chemical Corp., based in Northbrook, Ill., would have been subject to anti-dumping duties equal to 9.14% of the prices it previously had been charging in the U.S. Similarly, Kalium Chemicals, a Canadian unit of Pittsburgh-based PPG Industries Inc., could have been assessed duties equal to 29.67%.    Most of the Canadian potash exported to the U.S. is mined in Saskatchewan. The Canadian shipments are valued at more than $350 million a year. Two U.S. potash producers, Lundberg Industries Ltd. of Dallas, and New Mexico Potash Corp. of Memphis, Tenn., had filed the complaints that led to the threatened U.S. sanctions.    Other Canadian companies that signed the offer included Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, the Central Canada Potash division of Toronto-based Noranda Inc., and Rio Algom Ltd. of Toronto.    A lawyer for the U.S. petitioners said the Canadians' offer &quot;improves&quot; on an earlier one they made Dec. 9. The Commerce Department had initialed the Dec. 9 offer but withheld its final approval. By law, the department has until today to either reach some kind of settlement or confirm its earlier determination making the Canadian companies liable for varying anti-dumping duties.    The lawyers didn't disclose details of the formula except to report that it contains some &quot;flexibility&quot; in determining how much the Canadian prices would rise. </TEXT></DOC>
