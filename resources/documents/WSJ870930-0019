The Canadian Union of Postal Workers, representing 23,000 postal clerks and mail sorters, and Canada Post Corp., the state-owned company that operates the postal service, were pessimistic that a settlement of their contract differences could be reached soon. However, both sides said they would continue talks even though walkouts might occur.    Union president Jean-Claude Parrot said the union would begin rotating strikes if a settlement wasn't reached by the strike deadline of 12.01 a.m. EDT today.    Rotating strikes occur in one or more cities or regions on a given day. He wouldn't rule out the use of a nationwide walkout at a later date.    The major issue, job security, remained unresolved yesterday. The union opposes the post office's plan to sell postal franchises to retail businesses, saying it would result in a loss of 4,200 unionized positions. The union also rejects Canada Post's demands to increase part-time staff and move employees to different locations. The union wants the post office to expand by offering new services such as packaging and lottery-ticket sales.    Canada Post was preparing for the expected rotating strikes by making lists of people who answered its national advertisements for temporary staff. The company said it would expand its use of helicopters if necessary to move mail and employees.    Last June, violence erupted on picket lines at several Canadian post offices during rotating strikes by the Canadian Letter Carriers' Union in its contract dispute with Canada Post. Those strikes disrupted mail service for three weeks in June and July before a settlement was reached.    Many of Canada Post's contract demands are backed by a government conciliator's report that said the postal service should be able to franchise operations and move employees from one location to another.    Several business organizations are publicly supporting Canada Post's plans to keep the mail moving in the event of strikes. </TEXT></DOC>
