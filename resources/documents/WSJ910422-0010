The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. prepared a lawsuit butrefrained from filing it last week after the potentialdefendants agreed to waive the statute of limitations on thealleged wrongdoing, these persons said. The statute oflimitations was to have expired Friday, the third anniversaryof the bailout.</LP><TEXT>   Details of the draft lawsuit, including the names of thepotential defendants, weren't available. But a First Cityspokesman said, &quot;We have learned that the FDIC planned tofile a civil action against certain officers and directors ofsubsidiary banks of former First City, but not, to the bestof our knowledge, against officers and directors of formerFirst City Bancorp. in that capacity. That planned action hasnow been postponed.&quot;   The spokesman added that C. Ivan Wilson, a longtime FirstCity official who was recently appointed to succeed A. RobertAbboud as chairman and chief executive, wasn't among thosetargeted by the FDIC.   Mark Rosen, an assistant general counsel of the FDIC,declined to comment on the negotiations or to talk about theagency's grounds for suing. But banking attorneys and othersin the industry say such lawsuits generally allege defendantsbreached their fiduciary duties or acted with negligence.They said the FDIC might now be seeking an out-of-courtsettlement.   Such regulatory actions are expected to becomeincreasingly common in Texas as the statute of limitationswinds down for the spate of bank failures that hit the statein the late 1980s. First City was the first major bankholding company to require federal aid, but it was soonfollowed by such former giants as First RepublicBank Corp.(which isn't related to First Republic Bancorp. of SanFrancisco) and MCorp, both of Dallas. FDIC investigators areknown to be sifting through the books of those companies,looking for grounds for lawsuits against officers, directorsand professional consultants such as accountants and outsideattorneys.   But Houston-based First City isn't as well-positioned asthe others to withstand the onslaught of renewed badpublicity. Whereas First RepublicBank and MCorp were acquiredby healthy, out-of-state banks with a great deal of federalassistance, First City has stumbled again since its 1988rescue.   Analysts say First City's nearly $1 billion of federal aidwasn't enough to cover the bad loans made by previousmanagement. And the subsequent management team, led by Mr.Abboud, a former Chicago banker who raised $500 million inprivate capital to take over the bank, made a series of riskyout-of-state loans that have since gone bad. Mr. Abboud wasremoved by the board last month.   Now First City says it needs a new capital infusion of atleast $200 million. Officials are racing the clock to find abuyer before the company's franchise value erodes further.Persons familiar with the situation say as many as 10entities have expressed interest recently, including FirstGibraltar Bank, a big Texas thrift; BankAmerica Corp. of SanFrancisco; and a group of wealthy Arabs who are consideringjoining forces with Mr. Abboud and a group of Texasinvestors.   The proposed FDIC lawsuit probably wouldn't affect theseefforts, because it focuses on the actions of managers atFirst City prior to its recapitalization. But some of thepotential defendants remained at the organization after the1988 recapitalization, and are understood to include somecurrent high-ranking officers. A First City spokesmandeclined to comment, but said, &quot;We understand that much ofthe FDIC's concern involved transactions at the McAllen {bankunit} prior to its closing in April 1988.&quot;   Adding to First City's troubles, a shareholder earlierthis month filed a derivative lawsuit charging Mr. Abboud,top members of his management team and the board of directorswith breach of fiduciary duty, negligence and fraud forallegedly contributing to the company's current financialtroubles.   The complaint, filed in Houston federal court by MortimerShulman of New York, alleges, among other things, that theboard failed to exercise proper control over management andthat the defendants &quot;squandered millions of dollars ofcorporate assets on unnecessary perquisites for themselves,such as corporate jets, unnecessary travel and fully reservedluxury suites at glamorous hotels.&quot;   Unlike an earlier shareholder suit that seeks damages forshareholders, the Shulman complaint seeks to force thedefendants to pay the company itself to compensate for thelosses.</TEXT></DOC>
