Tribe has been at the center of the action.    Most prominently, the Harvard Law School professor helped Democratic senators devise legal arguments to defeat Judge Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination. He won a crucial Supreme Court victory for Pennzoil Co. in its battle with Texaco Inc. He has turned up frequently on television interview shows and in news articles as an expert on the high court and constitutional law. And just this week, he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of Supreme Court nominee Judge Anthony Kennedy.    &quot;He's constantly throwing off sparks,&quot; says John Ely, a Stanford Law School professor and a former Harvard colleague of Prof. Tribe's. &quot;He has a lot of new ideas, covering a vast array of issues.&quot;    But despite Prof. Tribe's high visibility, getting a handle on him isn't easy. His supporters call him an immensely talented legal thinker and a loyal ally; his critics see unbridled ambition, and charge that he is maneuvering for a Supreme Court seat of his own. Moreover, a look at his writings and legal career reveal a man who, though generally liberal, has in many matters taken a traditionally conservative stance.    &quot;He is someone who takes left-leaning constitutional positions,&quot; says a friend on the Harvard faculty, &quot;but he is a darling of corporate America when they need a lawyer in the Supreme Court.&quot;    Born in Shanghai, China, and raised in California, Prof. Tribe studied math at Harvard before switching to law for graduate work. He joined the Harvard faculty at the young age of 29, sometimes alienating colleagues with his brusque style.    Now 46, married and a father of two, he is widely recognized by lawyers, law professors, judges and justices as a brilliant advocate in Supreme Court cases. He is also a popular teacher whose classes are typically filled to capacity, and the author of an oft-quoted treatise on constitutional law, about which former Harvard Law School dean Erwin Griswold says, &quot;It may well be that no book . . . has ever had a greater influence on the development of American constitutional law.&quot;    Other lawyers are particularly impressed with his ability to learn quickly. &quot;When Larry joined us, it took him a couple of hours to grasp . . . what it took the rest of the staff a whole couple of days&quot; to absorb, says Mark Michelson, a Boston lawyer with whom Prof. Tribe worked on a case involving banking law. &quot;He's opinionated -- no doubt. But it's partly because he goes so fast. He's arrived at a conclusion before you even get started.&quot;    Friends add that he is a tireless worker with boundless energy. He rises by 5 a.m., works out at a health club and does some reading and writing at home before he arrives at the law school.    &quot;There's no doubt the one thing that drives Larry Tribe is personal ambition,&quot; says Albert Alschuler, a criminal-law professor at the University of Chicago Law School and a former graduate-school roommate of Mr. Tribe's at Harvard. &quot;Larry's a complicated person. Because of that consuming drive, a lot of people may get the impression that he is ruthless. But with his family and friends, including myself, he is a devoted father, husband and friend.&quot;    Prof. Tribe's critics, however, aren't so inclined to downplay his ambition. &quot;He's a hit man for hire,&quot; says Gary McDowell, a resident scholar at the conservative Center for Judicial Studies. Although Mr. McDowell concedes a &quot;grudging respect for his intellect,&quot; he argues that Prof. Tribe's &quot;influence academically is far more pervasive than it should be. His constitutional-law treatise, as it is called, is nothing but a compendium of his own views of what constitutional law ought to be.&quot;    Mr. McDowell contends, too, that Prof. Tribe has run &quot;a shameless campaign for the Supreme Court, coming out against Judge Bork and in favor of Judge Kennedy to make himself look like a picture of moderation.&quot;    On the matter of his book on constitutional law, Prof. Tribe concedes that he has &quot;taken a little more care to draw distinctions&quot; in the second edition, which was published this week. But he firmly denies that he is posturing for a spot on the highcourt bench. &quot;I don't have that calculated an approach to life,&quot; he says.    Supporting this assertion, some of his colleagues point to the evidence of a career in which he has at times taken the unpopular side in controversial cases. &quot;This is not the charted path of a smart man plotting his way to the top,&quot; says Kathleen Sullivan, a constitutional-law professor at Harvard who worked with Prof. Tribe when he represented the Rev. Sun Myung Moon in a religious-liberties case.    In most of his law-review articles and books, and in many of his Supreme Court cases, Prof. Tribe has taken a broad view of the Constitution that places him in traditional liberal ranks. For example, as he compiled a 9-3 won-lost record in the Supreme Court over the past eight years, he defended -- free of charge, though unsuccessfully -- the rights of homosexuals to engage in private sexual conduct without fear of prosecution. He had better luck in defending a Berkeley, Calif., rent-control law and in arguing that the press and the public have a First Amendment right of access to criminal trials and other events. He also successfully defended a California moratorium on nuclear-power development.    In his writing, he has offered several theories to justify the Supreme Court's widely criticized 1973 decision recognizing a woman's right to an abortion. Two years ago, he was highly critical of a 1980 decision that Congress may refuse to pay for abortions for poor women.    And testifying last September in the fight over Judge Bork, he disputed the view attributed to the judge that only those rights spelled out in the Constitution may be recognized. &quot;The principal aim of the original Constitution,&quot; Prof. Tribe said, &quot;. . . was to create a national government that, although sufficiently powerful to bind together states of great diversity, would not threaten the individual liberty that the people retained and did not cede.&quot;    At the same time, however, other of Prof. Tribe's ideas -- and some of his clients -- appear to be those of a true conservative.    He contends, for example, that judges who interpret the Constitution &quot;have to genuinely feel restraint, because there is a danger . . . of judges who will pour anything they believe into the Constitution.&quot; In a 1985 Harvard Law Review article, he argued that if affirmative action deprives &quot;faultless&quot; whites of seniority or jobs, they should be compensated. Elsewhere in his prolific writings he has supported states' rights under the Constitution -- a conservative position he has pursued in practice.    His involvement in the Texaco-Pennzoil case began after a federal judge, in January 1986, had blocked the requirement of the Texas state courts that Texaco post a multibillion-dollar bond to appeal the Texas ruling against it. To many liberals, it was a case of a federal judge's intervening to protect against an abusive state court system -- an action civil-rights lawyers relied on as a powerful tool in the '60s and '70s. But to Prof. Tribe, it was an outrage that a federal judge would interfere with the state courts. &quot;It's almost as though a federal judge had undertaken the bailout of Chrysler,&quot; he commented in this newspaper the next morning. A day later, he was on a Pennzoil retainer.    &quot;I think the idea that various parts of the Constitution presuppose some significant autonomy for states and localities is an important piece of the document,&quot; he says. &quot;And the fact that it may not fit with a generally liberal vision of the Constitution seems to me to be irrelevant to someone whose task it is to interpret the document.&quot;    To Prof. Tribe, this mix of liberal and conservative views doesn't reflect any philosophical inconsistency. His concern isn't just social issues, but also constitutional theories. &quot;There really is no unitary theory that can make sense of the whole Constitution,&quot; he says. &quot;I think that both those liberals who read the Constitution as expressing some single vision of human rights, and those conservatives who read it as expressing some single vision of structural checks and balances are making the same kind of mistake.&quot;    Mr. Michelson, the Boston lawyer, adds that this approach doesn't appear to bother clients, either: &quot;When you're in enough trouble to need Larry Tribe, you don't think about his politics or his fee.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
