They wouldn't be caught dead with Adlai Stevenson's holey shoe or John Kennedy's windswept hair. And in the best American tradition, Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis are good sports in debate: An hour-and-a-half of acrimony with smiles and, at the end, a handshake -- as if all the barbs were make-believe.    Tacticians and writers on each side have picked the arenas and crafted the words with a precision that would make computers blush. Yet the rhetoric falls flat. Tomorrow's debate will be the candidates' last chance to stir their gigantic audience. Voters are still waiting for them to breathe fire into this vapid campaign.    So, what's wrong? Kenneth Carmine, a 25-year-old locksmith who has never voted, blurted out a clue:   &quot;Who are you going to vote for?&quot;    &quot;I don't know,&quot; Mr. Carmine said.    &quot;Have you listened to Bush and Dukakis?&quot;    &quot;No. But I will.&quot;    &quot;What will you listen for?&quot;    &quot;If they mean it.&quot;    No one I know reads campaign speeches. But, like Mr. Carmine most of us will listen -- searching past the surface for clues to integrity and brains. The nation's sixth sense is now scanning the candidates' voice qualities and tones of voice, inflections, emphases, quivers, and even blinks, squints, smiles, frowns and gestures for reliable insights. &quot;If you want to know if a person really means what he is saying,&quot; says Harvard Prof. Robert Rosenthal, a pioneer in the study of nonverbal signals, &quot;you may be better off listening to his tone of voice rather than his words.&quot;    Harry Truman proved that words are merely hot air until voice empowers them with feelings. Early in the 1948 campaign, Truman spoke with his face buried in the text -- reading each sentence as if he couldn't wait to get to the end. He was so dull that everybody believed Thomas E. Dewey, who was also a bore, was a shoo-in. Faced with what looked like certain defeat, Truman threw away his speech texts and, with note cards in hand, set the country afire with his &quot;give 'em hell&quot; whistle-stop campaign. Since his points didn't change, we can assume something in his voice convinced voters he meant what he said. Everyone went to bed convinced Dewey had won. But many committed to Dewey in the surveys pulled the lever for Truman.    Today, Mr. Dukakis says he wants to be president, but sounds cool about the idea. Mr. Bush speaks with more vigor, but a decisive majority still is elusive. Why are so many unmoved when they see and hear the candidates speak?    The vice-presidential debate last week showed the power of the voice. When Lloyd Bentsen spoke, his voice had the resonance of a fully developed vocal mechanism. On the other hand, Dan Quayle's voice, still rings with the pitch and thin quality of youth -- usually a sign that voice-production skills are weak. His answers read better than they sounded, and his still photos are more impressive than when you see him in action talking. His voice and speech, in short, undermined his claims of valid experience.    When vocal pitch rises markedly and anchors at a high level, as it does for Mr. Bush, it signals insecurity. When Mr. Bush says excellence in education is &quot;not going to be dictated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.&quot; but then on the other hand says there should be a federal law to require the Pledge of Allegiance in the classroom, his voice rises in pitch, making him seem defensive. Mr. Bush could control some of this by imagining that his pitch shouldn't go higher than his head. But that mental trick works only when a speaker is confident about his ideas.    Mr. Dukakis is equally unconvincing when he garbles, &quot;you help families/you help youngsters to live better lives/more decent lives.&quot; The key nouns, &quot;families, youngsters, lives&quot; are so rushed that those simple words lose impact. And when the ends of phrases fade, he bores listeners because he's hard to follow. Worse, he sounds curt, commanding and insensitive. Often his words sound like a machine-gun: &quot;Fact is that he has no plans./But he does have a record./A record of indifference./A record of neglect.&quot; Such rattling suggests weak commitment to his own ideas. He could correct much of this simply by saying the ends of his sentences -- where the clinchers are -- louder than the beginnings, and by giving equal time to main nouns, verbs, and modifiers. And if he links short, related sentences together on one breath, he'll be more fluent, clearer and easier to listen to because fluency helps reduce throat strain.    Both candidates weaken their images in other ways. Mr. Bush continually tilts his head to the left and Mr. Dukakis to the right -- never a strong gesture. They both try a friendly look with smiles that often erode into smirks. The whole effect is unreal: Anger seems false, strong pledges smug. During the debate Mr. Bush rarely looked at the camera, losing a direct appeal to 100 million voters, and Mr. Dukakis's rapid blinking into the camera gave him an insecure, grade-school look.    Americans are generous. We overlook signs of insecurity when the pressure is up. But an apologetic image, which both candidates sport, makes us cynical when it doesn't match what we hear. Gentlemen, get your heads straight, look your listeners in the eye, and say your piece like you mean it -- and mean it as you say it. Persuasion governs a democracy -- not orders or one-line quips. We want real conviction and flair-like Truman's. There's still time for each of you to convince us that you should be president.    ---   Mr. Proodian is a New York-based speech consultant and associate professor of speech at Brooklyn College. </TEXT></DOC>
