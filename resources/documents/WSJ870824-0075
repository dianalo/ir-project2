For high action and adventure nowadays, we go to movies about the Vietnam War. Who can forget that nocturnal fire fight in &quot;Platoon,&quot; or the way those sniper bullets ripped into the Marines in &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;? Appetites whetted by such excitement will turn eagerly to the latest installment of HBO Showcase, three original dramas grouped under the title &quot;Vietnam War Story&quot; (premiering Saturday, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, and repeating in September).    But they'll be disappointed. The first film, &quot;The Pass,&quot; deals with desertion and danger in a Vietnamese brothel, but except for the obligatory cable-TV helping of female nudity, it provides few of the thrills dished out by the current crop of Vietnam films. Instead it harks back to the drama anthology TV shows of the '50s and '60s: modest production values; tight shots of individual actors communicating in words rather than grunts; characters serving to dramatize human traits rather than as bodies to be creatively blasted apart by enterprising production designers.    The second story, &quot;The Mine,&quot; offers even less blood-spurting excitement. Instead it focuses on a single soldier, a Marine named K.C. who is returning to active duty with a new squad after recovering from nearly fatal injuries. For reasons he doesn't divulge, K.C. keeps aloof from his new comrades in arms, rebuffing their banter and turning away when one of them is wounded on patrol.    But then comes a moment of truth. K.C. walks on a mud dike between two rice paddies, and he and his companions hear a click. He has stepped on a pressure-sensitive land mine, which will explode the moment he steps off. His only choice is to remain there, holding his heavy M-60, exposed to snipers and poached by the merciless heat, until a bomb demolition team can be flown out from the base. And his only hope is the psychological and moral support of the two men assigned to wait with him.    One of the most debilitating aspects of duty in Vietnam was the constant rotation of personnel in and out of combat units, which disrupted the emotional ties that bind men together in battle. On one level, K.C.'s story is about this debilitation: Instead of returning to a familiar unit, he is among strangers. But on a deeper level, it's about the inevitability of those bonds forming in any case, because soldiers need each other in the face of terror and death.    K.C. stands there on the dike, and the hours crawl past. And by current Hollywood standards, so do the 30 minutes of this drama. A few artillery shells burst in the rice paddies, but there is precious little action. The climax comes when K.C. relaxes his tight grip on himself long enough to relate the tale of why he is trying so hard not to feel anything for this new group of men. Predictably enough, he describes the way a buddy of his died trying to reach K.C. after K.C. had been shot. &quot;After that,&quot; he concludes, &quot;I decided nobody's going to die trying to save me, and I'm not going to die trying to save nobody.&quot;    K.C.'s speech is too theatrical, in the negative sense of being overwritten (in a script that is otherwise excellent), and overacted (by Eriq La Salle, a young actor who is otherwise convincing). No state-of-the-art Vietnam movie would include such a long speech. Why show a talking head when, in the same amount of time, you can show three or four mute heads being crushed, incinerated and pulverized? No doubt &quot;The Mine&quot; will be criticized for being too slow and too verbal.    Another criticism is to be expected. &quot;The Mine&quot; does not emphasize that which sets Vietnam apart from any other war setting. The same is true of &quot;The Pass,&quot; which is set in a brothel but could take place in any no-man's-land in any conflict. And the third film, &quot;Home,&quot; deals with cheerfulness and despair among severely disabled veterans encountering one another in a stateside hospital.    People who feel that the Vietnam experience was radically different from World War II, or even Korea, may take offense at the universality of these stories. The offense may be compounded by the anachronistic tone of these low-budget, close-up half-hour dramas. &quot;Vietnam War Story&quot; even begins with black-and-white still photographs that could have been taken in any recent war. Perhaps it was sheer opportunism on the part of HBO and Nexus Productions, the fledgling company of actor-director Georg Stanford Brown, his wife, Tyne Daley (&quot;Cagney and Lacey&quot;), and Edward Gold. Who's to say they didn't just jump on the Vietnam-movie bandwagon with material that deliberately sidesteps controversy?    All these criticisms may be valid. But to my mind, they are balanced by the fact that &quot;Vietnam War Story&quot; re-humanizes a topic that has been dehumanized by all the pyrotechnics of &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Jacket.&quot; War is dehumanizing, but does the lesson really get across in films that are themselves dehumanizing? By stopping the vivid carnage long enough to study a few individuals, &quot;Vietnam War Story&quot; reminds us that these traumatic things happened to people, not to moving targets in the special-effects lab. </TEXT></DOC>
