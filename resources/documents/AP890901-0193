DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A published report about convicted financierIvan F. Boesky and Michael Milken raises questions about whetherBoesky was trying to entrap the junk bond trader.   The Washington Post reported Thursday that Boesky, now a keygovernment informant, allegedly met with Milken, former head ofDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield bond department, in July1986, before Wall Street's insider trading scandal mushroomed.Milken now faces charges in the probe.   According to the Post, a confidential Securities and ExchangeCommission memorandum indicated the two met ``to discuss how to`conceal the true nature' of a $5.3 million payment from Boesky toDrexel.''   The government contends the $5.3 million payment was part of asecret stock trading arrangement between the two high-powered WallStreet figures. Drexel claims the March 1986 payment was forconsulting services it provided Boesky.   ``Boesky and Milken met in July 1986 to discuss how they couldsubstantiate the `consulting services' gloss which they had used toconceal the true nature of the $5.3 million payment,'' the SEC memosaid, according to the Post.   Prosecutors have never revealed when Boesky began cooperatingwith authorities but the date could be significant for Milken'sdefense against securities fraud and racketeering charges.   If Boesky was cooperating in July 1986, the SEC memo mightindicate that he was trying to gather evidence on Milken for thegovernment, an issue that Milken defd raise at his trial, set tostart next year.   Several Wall figures implicated by Boesky, including invest andWest Coast stock broker Boyd Jefferies, have pleaded guiltd in turngiven information on others accused o The SEC asked Post editors onWednesday not to publish confidermation contained in the May 1988memo, claiming the thought processes of commission attorneys'' nowsuing Milkr securities law violations.   John H. Sturc,in the SEC's enforcement division, which preparedthe confidentmemo in May 1988, was said to be furious that ihenewsaper.   However, Sturc declined all comment on the maturday, as did otherSEC officials.   ``Any sby Michael Milken is totally untrue,'' Milken attorneyMartin Fmenbaum said through a spokeswoman in New York.g leaks bythe government are deplorable and are designed to deike Milken hisright to a fair trial,'' Flumenbaum's statement said.   The SEC's two-page letter to the Post, which said the memo'sdisclosure was unauthorized, added that publication could ``injure,outside of the judicial processes, the reputation of persons who areeither entit day in court or who are not alleged by the commissionto have violated the federal securities laws and possibly to impedethession's ability to litigate.''   But Post Managing Editor Leor. said, ``We feel that what wepublished is neody's rights.''   In its editions Friday, the Post again quo confidential SEC memo_ the newspaper did not st to Milken had told governmentinvestigators he ``fabricated'' trading losses in transactionsBoesky.   The SEC memo was quoted as saying that Milken aide CharlesThurnher admitted he fabricated a loss figure for a Boeskyinvestment in Unocal Corp. common stock because he believed thatBoesky's bookkeeper had inflated Boesky's losses from anothertransaction.   Both of the transactions were part of billion payment from Boeskyto Milken that the SEC alleges was part of a secret stock-tradingarrangement between the two men.   Boesky, once a leading speculator in the sf potential takeovertargets, stunned the financial community in November 1986 when heagreed to pay a then-record $100 million to settle SEC civil insidertrading charges.   He also struck a plea bargain with federal prosecutors in riscooperation and is serving a three-year prison sentence forconspiracy to lie to the SEC.   nd defense lawyers will not say when Boesky began cooperating, tdocuments at the time he was sentenced in 198egan after he wasimplicated in an insider trading scheme by Dennis Levine.   Levine, a former Drexel investt banker, was hit with civilinsider trading charges in May 1986 and pleaded guilty to fourfelony counts and settled civil charges a month later.   Drexel has agreed to pay a record $650 million in fines andrestitution and to plead guilty to six felony counts in order tosettle both civil and criminal charges. Milken, who also was namedin the SEC civil charges against Drexel, maintains his innocence andhas refused tNY-09-01-89 0130EDT</TEXT></DOC>
