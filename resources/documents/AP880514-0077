Meese ``told me that he also opposed'' any dismissal and ``hewould convey my thoughts to the president,'' U.S. Attorney LeonKellner of Miami said Friday after meeting with the attorneygeneral in Washington.   ``He did that today,'' Kellner said.   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle, whose office in Tampa obtainedone of two drug indictments against Noriega in February, said fromFlorida if he were ordered to sign an order dismissing chargesagainst Noriega, ``They wouldn't have to fire me, I would resign.''   ``I could not myself sign an order of dismissal, but I may notbe in a position to stop it,'' Merkle said Friday in his firstpublic comment about the negotitations reportedly going on toremove the military leader from power.   Reagan administration officials have said they were ``pleabargaining'' with the Panamanian military chief and de facto rulerover the possible dropping of drug-smuggling indictments returnedin February by grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla.   The State Department apparently believes that dismissal of theindictments is the only way to induce Noriega's departure, but theJustice Department sees that concession as too high a price to pay.   But Kellner said dismissing the case would ``send the wrongmessage to the people of this country.''   ``What it says is that the bigger you are and if you have morethreats to give to this country, we'll let you get away withcriminality,'' Kellner said, explaining his objections.   ``How do we continue ... going after the little fish when thebig fish can walk away?'' he said, referring in particular to theColombia-based Medellin cartel.   As he has since word of a possible deal with Noriega leaked outWednesday, Meese told reporters he would have no comment on thematter.   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., today lauded the administration'sobjective of getting rid of Noriega but said the charges againsthim must stand. ``Letting him off the hook would send exactly thewrong message at exactly the wrong time to the world's drugking-pins, the peddlers of death and misery,'' said the formerpresidential candidate in a statement released by his office.   At the White House on Friday, presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater was asked about assertions by Noriega that negotiationswith the United States on his eventual departure from power havecollapsed.   ``He says that all the time,'' Fitzwater said. ``He said `fallapart' or something similar before.   ``We are still talking. We are still negotiating.''   Fitzwater said Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state forinter-American affairs, met with Reagan on Friday afternoon. Hewould not say what the subject of the meeting was or who else, ifanyone, attended.   The president left for his weekend at Camp David a half-hourlater than originally scheduled, but Fitzwater would not saywhether the meeting caused the delay.   Earlier Friday, Panama's foreign minister denied that Noriegawas negotiating to have the drug charges dropped.   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter, interviewed onABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' said no deal involving Noriegawas imminent and the drug indictment ``isn't really part of thenegotiations.'' He did not elaborate on what was being discussed.   A top State Department official, Michael Kozak, has been engagedin secret negotiations with Noriega in Panama, and administrationsources said Wednesday the military chieftain was told that if heleft Panama for a year, perhaps in August, the indictments would bedropped.   However, Noriega said Friday night, ``I have not talked with Mr.Kozak,'' and he called for the U.S. ambassador to Panama to leavethe country.   ``The dignity of Panama is not negotiable while there areforeign troops on our territory, humiliating our soil, while thereis economic aggression, as long as there are threats, as long asthere is psychological war ... as long as Ambassador Arthur Davisdoes not get out,'' Noriega said during a meeting in Rio Hato, 60miles southwest of Panama City.   State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said she had nocomment on Noriega's statements or whether the United States wasconsidering withdrawing Davis from Panama.   Noriega has survived widespread public protests and an economiccollapse at home as well as sustained U.S. diplomatic and economicpressure.</TEXT></DOC>
