North and his three Iran-Contraco-defendants.   Some of the documents sought in the defense's extensivepre-trial discovery motion are so sensitive, independent counselLawrence E. Walsh has said, that their courtroom disclosure wouldjeopardize intelligence activities and could expose ``people invery difficult situations to torture and death'' in the Middle East.   District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell will have to rule on whether toorder Walsh to give the defense the documents sought in the 88-pagediscovery motion. But the judge already has said the defense isentitled to review any papers that are relevant to the defense.   Already, more than 85,000 pages of classified material have beenturned over to the defense and an interagency task force isreviewing another 200,000 pages bearing government secrets.   It is apparent from the defense request that North, formernational security adviser John M. Poindexter, and arms dealersAlbert Hakim and Richard V. Secord want documents they know are sosensitive that agencies like the CIA and the National SecurityAgency will fight hard to keep them secret.   If the defense can convince Gesell that documents which thegovernment won't declassify are crucial for its case, the judgemight be forced to dismiss crucial portions of the indictment.   Walsh has conceded that he must defer to Attorney General EdwinMeese III on whether to disclose or withhold government secrets.   Documents sought by the defense include material about U.S.intelligence capabilities in Iran, and ``efforts to locate,reserve, or obtain information on American citizens held hostage inLebanon or elsewhere.''   The defendants want to inspect highly classified message trafficbetween the United States and Israel _ as well as intelligenceintercepts _ regarding the transfer of American weapons by Israelto Iran in 1985.   Secret court orders allowing electronic surveillance of Iranianofficials who visited Washington in 1986 as part of thearms-for-hostages negotiations are also sought.   The defendants also want details about other covert operationsconducted by the U.S. government with the help of private citizensand companies.   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, and hisco-defendants are accused of conspiring to defraud the governmentby diverting profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to theNicaraguan rebels.   The discovery motion, initially filed under seal last week butlater released, signals that the defendants are trying to gatherproof that many of their actions were approved by other officialsin the Reagan administration.   The defense wants notes of conversations with President Reaganabout the Iran-Contra affair taken by Vice President Bush,Secretary of State George Shultz, former White House chief of staffDonald Regan, Meese and other top officials in the government.   It also seeks documents showing that other U.S. officials``provided funding or logistical or other support'' for the Contrasduring the ban on U.S. military aid imposed by Congress.   The defendants requested documents ``indicating or tending toestablish authorization, approval, knowledge, or awareness, by anyofficer, employee or agent of the United States, of the`Enterprise' supply network as allegedly established by defendantsNorth and Secord to support military and paramilitary operations''by the Contras.   The defense motion said the documents sought are ``directlymaterial to pivital defense issues ... including each defendant'sknowledge, intent and motive, as well as to the authority of thedefendants to act for or on behalf or with the consent of theUnited States government.''</TEXT></DOC>
