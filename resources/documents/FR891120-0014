It required that all designated sponsors of exchangevisitor programs be United States agencies or institutions. On May 29,1987, the Agency published a notice of proposed rulemaking at 52 FR 20097to provide that Responsible Officers of designated sponsors be citizensof the United States and that designated sponsors be incorporated in theUnited States. On August 11, 1989, at 54 FR 32964 (corrected at 54 FR 34503,August 21, 1989, and amended at 54 FR 40386 October 2, 1989), the Agencyadopted a final rule wherein the longstanding requirement of the UnitedStates citizenship of sponsors of exchange visitor programs was furtherdefined and documentation of United States citizenship was required tobe furnished to the Agency.

These comments were discussed at length at 54 FR 32964,August 11, 1989, upon adoption of the final rule. Following that notice,which provides that current sponsors must comply with the definition ofcitizen, some sponsors complained that they did not have adequate notice.While it categorically rejects this charge, the Agency, nonetheless, nowpostpones the compliance date and reopens the proceeding for additionalcomments regarding the wording of the definition.At the outset it should be noted that the Agency is under no legal requirementor obligation to seek public comment on the regulation. The AdministrativeProcedure Act at 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1) specifically exempts from applicationof the Act a ``foreign affairs function of the United States.'' There isno question that designation of exchange visitor sponsors for internationalexchange programs is a foreign affairs function. The operation and administrationof the exchange program is an instrument of foreign policy. The J-visawas created by section 109 of the Mutual Educational and Cultural ExchangeAct of 1961 to ``serve solely the purposes of [that Act].'' 1961 U.S. CodeCong. andamp; Admin. News 2774. The Congressional intent behind the visamay be discerned from the statement that:<ITAG tagnum="21">In modern international relations a positive U.S. Government programpromoting educational and cultural cooperation is essential to the welfareof the American people.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">1961 U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Ad. News 2760. Accordingly, the decisionregarding the designation of an exchange organization is a foreign relationsdecision.Thus, even though it was not required to do so but because the Agency hasa long history of cooperation with its designated sponsors, the Agencyannounced publicly in 1987 that it proposed to amend the regulations andinvited comments. It was not the Agency's intention to waive the exemption,rather, the Agency wanted to preserve its valuable working relationshipwith the sponsors. It was in this spirit of cooperation that comments wereinvited. The public was notified that the Agency perceived that it wasrestricting and wanted to continue to restrict designation of sponsorsto United States organizations. Further, the public was notified that theAgency was concerned about the designation of foreign corporations andorganizations. At least one member of the public understood the Agency'sconcern and submitted a comment attempting to convince the Agency thatforeign corporations should be designated as exchange visitor sponsors.Consequently, the Agency's query to the public was, and remains, limitedto a very narrow question_how to define ``United States organization''for the purpose of the regulations. The Agency finds that it is axiomaticthat designations must be limited to United States entities. It is clearthat Congress intended that designations be so limited; since 1949 theregulations have reiterated this requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Authority To Designate</ITAG>Under the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948,two programs_information dissemination and educational exchange_were establishedto carry out the purposes of the Act. The authority of the Director ofthe United States Information Agency to designate exchange visitor programsderives from two sources, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the MutualEducational and Cultural Exchange Act. The Immigration and NationalityAct at 8 U.S.C. 1101(15)(J) defines an exchange visitor as:<ITAG tagnum="20">an alien * * * who is coming temporarily to the United States as aparticipant in a program designated by the Director of the United StatesInformation Agency * * * *</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The description of the programs which the Director may designate iscontained in section 102 of the Mutual Educational and Cultural ExchangeAct of 1961.Congress envisioned that ``the private resources of this country and thecooperation of <T3>United States citizens </T3>abroad'' would be enlisted to assist inthe educational exchange. <T3>Id.</T3> at 1014 (emphasis added).<ITAG tagnum="21">[I]t is vital that the Department of State can and should cooperatewith the efforts of private <T3>citizens</T3> and with profit and non-profit organizations interestedin promoting the better understanding of the United States abroad and lastingfriendship. Also, the areas of cooperation, consultation, and separateactivity between the Department of State and private industry (e.g., films,radio, press, magazines, books) are sufficiently great to expect fruitfuland harmonious relationships * * * * The importance of worthy private <T3>United States</T3> activities in the foreign field cannot be exaggerated.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id.</T3> at 1015 (emphasis added).Thus, from this legislative history it can be inferred that Congress contemplatedthat the assistance from the private sector would be assistance from the<T3>United States</T3> private sector. Further, it can be inferred thatit is necessary that a designated organization may fairly be describedas an ``organization interested in promoting the better understanding ofthe United States abroad and lasting friendship.'' Upon the passage ofthe Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, the exchangesprogram in the 1948 Act was adopted by the 1961 Act. However, there wasno substantial change in the underlying character of the exchanges. Rather,the 1961 Act was intended to expand and strengthen the programs establishedunder the previous Act. 1961 U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Ad. News 2760.The Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act requires that the schoolsand institutions of learning designated to participate in educational exchangebe United States ``schools and institutions.'' Section 102(1)(B). Consequently,it is necessary to define ``United States schools and institutions'' foreducational exchanges.It should also be noted that Congress intended that foreign governmentswould participate in the exchange program. However, Congress did not contemplatethat these governments would be designated J-1 visa sponsors and have directaccess to United States Government controlled documents. Rather, it isclear that Congress envisioned government-to-government agreements wherebythe two governments would cooperate in the field of exchange. Congressdid not intend that another government would have virtual control overexchange visitors to this country, as is evidenced by Section 103, whichprovides for agreements with foreign governments. If Congress intendedthat the powers of the USIA Director to determine exchange program policyand participants be vested in foreign governments, this section of theAct would be unnecessary and redundant. The rules of statutory constructionpreclude interpretations which would render a section of a statute eitherredundant or unnecessary.The Agency Was Given Complete Discretion To Decide When To Work With PrivateIndustryThe legislative history of the Smith-Mundt Act (1948 U.S. Code Cong. andamp;Ad. News 1019) states:<ITAG tagnum="21">Section 1005 states the intention of Congress that the Departmentshall make use of the services of private agencies wherever practicable.The House committee report interprets this to mean that the Secretary ofState should use a private agency ``if a private agency can perform anactivity as well as or better than a Government agency, and at no greaterexpense.'' This language should not, of course, enable any particular privateagency to demand a contract or a grant of funds for participation in thepurposes of this act. The discretion would seem to the committee to liewith the Secretary of State to determine what agencies should receive publicfunds through contracts or grants.</ITAG>Similarly, the Agency has discretion to designate or to refuse to designateany private organization as an exchange visitor sponsor. The grant of discretionarypower to the USIA Director is expressed in the broadest of terms. It providesonly the barest standards or criteria by which the Agency is to administereducational and cultural exchanges.As the Agency stated in its notice of August 11, 1989, 54 FR 32964, 32965:<ITAG tagnum="21">8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(J) merely refers to the designation functionof the Agency by describing an exchange visitor as a ``participant in aprogram designated by the Director of the United States Information Agency.''No criteria are set forth requiring the Agency to designate certain programs.The criteria are left to Agency discretion. Because of the nature of foreignrelations, the agency has been given broad authority to implement its legislation.The courts have found that this authority is_broader than that given todomestic agencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Promulgation of regulations consistent with the Act and its legislativehistory are not considered an abuse of agency discretion. (See <T3>Zemel</T3> v. <T3>Rusk,</T3> 381 U.S. 1 (1965) and <T3>Haig</T3> v. <T3>Agee, </T3>453 U.S. 280 (1981). See also <T3>Slyper</T3> v. <T3>Attorney General,</T3> 827 F.2d 821, 823 (D.C. Cir. 1987) wherein thecourt stated: ``The statute contains no standard or criterion upon whichto make or withhold a favorable recommendation. This broad delegation ofdiscretionary authority is `clear and convincing evidence' of congressionalintent to restrict judicial review in cases such as those we now face.'')</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Agency, in the exercise of its discretion, has determined thatnoncitizens should not be given excessive authority in making the foreignrelations determination coupled with the strong visa issuance recommendation(which is inherent in the responsibility for filling out the IAP-66 forms)as to which aliens should be exchange visitors.</ITAG>The Agency, in the exercise of its discretion and in interpreting its statuteand legislative history, has determined, since 1949, that it must limitthe designation of exchange visitor sponsors to United States entities.The question is how to define what constitutes a United States entity.Thus, the question before the public is how to define ``United States citizen''for the purpose of the regulations. The present definition as promulgatedon August 11, 1989 is:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Citizen of the United States'' means (a) an individual who is acitizen of the United States or of one of its possessions, or (b) a partnershipof which each member is a United States citizen, or (c) a corporation orassociation created or organized under the laws of the United States, ofwhich the chief executive officer, president, chairman of the board ofdirectors, and 75 per centum of the members of the board and its othermanaging officers are United States citizens and in which at least 75 percentum of the stock or voting interest is owned or controlled by personswho are citizens of the United states or of one of its possessions.</ITAG>The Agency is concerned that the control of the entities which are designatedas exchange visitor sponsors be vested in United States citizens. If thedefinition promulgated by the Agency excludes entities which are controlledby United States interests, the Agency will consider a new definition,provided that such definition ensures that designated sponsors will notbe controlled by foreign interests. On the other hand, the Agency is alsoconcerned that entities which have performed valuable service in the internationalexchange field may be excluded from the field as a result of the new definition.Comments should address the question of whether a new definition can bedrafted that will balance the requirement for United States control ofthe J-1 visa process with the need to preserve the international characterof many of the successful exchange organizations.The Agency is aware that some entities, such as universities, are neithercorporations nor associations. Accordingly, the Agency may add the term``entity'' to the definition. On the other hand, the addition of ``entitycreated by state or local law'' to the definition, may be more appropriate.The Agency is also aware that some United States corporations do not knowthe citizenship of all of their stockholders. Consequently, the Agencyis interested in learning whether there is another way to determine thatthe controlling interest is vested in United States citizens.Additionally, the Agency understands that there are some very large partnershipsin which only a very small portion of the partners are not United Statescitizens. On the other hand, in a small partnership, that same proportionof partners may wield considerable control. Thus, the question is whetherthere is a way to redefine United States partnerships to address this problem.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Alberto J.
