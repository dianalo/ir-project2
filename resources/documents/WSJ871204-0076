Within two hours, Col. Don Stovall, the head of the U.S. team, has requisitioned two helicopters and two jeeps and has begun moving his men into a major Soviet army training exercise. Soon he is walking among Soviet tank crews, taking pictures and chatting with them in Russian.    This unprecedented trip, arranged on two days' notice in late August, might seem like an intelligence officer's fantasy. But since then, British and Russian inspection teams have paid similar visits to the other side. The inspections are now business as usual for the diplomats and military men who have been trying to impose arms controls on conventional weapons and military forces.    This may be the dawning of a new era of arms control, one in which ways are found to reduce the size and weaponry of the armies that have been facing each other on the plains of central Europe since the end of World War II. Negotiating cuts in conventional forces, long considered to be a sideshow to nuclear-weapons talks, is being pushed toward center stage as the U.S. and the Soviet Union prepare to sign an agreement to remove intermediate-range nuclear weapons from Europe.    The diplomatic action is in Vienna, where two sets of talks are under way. One of them, known as the Mandate Talks, is attempting to set the ground rules for a new, ambitious set of negotiations that would cover the vast array of military forces extending from the Urals to the Atlantic Ocean. A second set, called the Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions talks, known by its acronym MBFR, is grinding slowly into its 15th year.    Central to both is the new kind of inspection carried out at Minsk. Called a &quot;challenge inspection,&quot; it is designed to allow specialists from one side immediate access to an area on the other side where a suspicious military event might be occurring. If and when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact agree upon conventional arms reductions, challenge inspections would be used to verify them.    Stephen J. Ledogar, a U.S. ambassador involved in both sets of talks here, senses movement. &quot;I do have the impression that they {the Soviets} are trying to get an agreement on new talks,&quot; he says. &quot;We haven't had the propaganda lectures or extraneous matter for quite a while.&quot;    The movement seems to be coming from both sides. Among the Western allies, there is widespread fear that removal of some nuclear weapons from Europe will make it more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation unless the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional weapons is diminished. On the Soviet side, it is widely believed that Mikhail Gorbachev needs cuts in his conventional forces to free funds for his promised overhaul of the economy.    But several formidable obstacles remain, the first of which is known as the &quot;data barrier.&quot; While the numbers and potency of nuclear weapons are generally agreed upon, that isn't true for conventional forces. At the MBFR talks, says Ambassador Jan Hein Van De Mortel, the head of the Dutch delegation and spokesman for the Western ambassadors, the Soviets have never given accurate figures. Instead, they have been feeding the West &quot;numbers borrowed from Western analysts, some of which have been taken out of context,&quot; he says.    The head of the Soviet delegation, Ambassador Valerian V. Mikhailov, dismisses the complaint. &quot;When serious negotiations start, everything regarding the data will be put on the table on both sides,&quot; he says.    Assuming the diplomats overcome this obstacle, they would immediately face a more daunting one: How to reduce the forces. West German Defense Minister Manfred Woerner asserts that conventional arms control can't be reduced to a simple matter of achieving numerical equality. &quot;It must aim at invasion capability,&quot; he argues.    And even if an agreement can be reached, there is the problem of how to verify it. Two years ago, the diplomats here assaulted this barrier and failed. The MBFR talks have never quite recovered.    In December 1985, the U.S. unveiled a &quot;radical plan&quot; to break the deadlock by agreeing to a version of a Soviet troop withdrawal proposal, saying that exchanges on data could come later. The Soviets responded in February 1986, with a draft ready for signing.    Then each side balked at the small print in each other's proposal. The Russians said a complex U.S. verification plan was too invasive of military secrecy. &quot;In a nutshell,&quot; grumbles Ambassador Mikhailov, &quot;we are being offered five cents of disarmament and $1,000 worth of verification at our cost.&quot;    Adm. Van De Mortel, the Dutch representative, counters that without detailed, advance information on the troop units and weapons they are supposed to find, the value of small inspection teams -- like the U.S. Army team's recent venture at Minsk -- is more symbolic than real for verification purposes.    Despite the problems, some diplomats see light at the end of what has been a long and very dark tunnel. The larger, Urals-to-the-Atlantic arena offers some advantages for both sides. The Russians, for example, will be able to count French and Spanish forces, making the lopsided imbalance of arms and weapons on the Warsaw Pact side look smaller.    And the West will be able to propose Soviet troop withdrawals to areas beyond the Urals to counter U.S. troop withdrawals back to the States. The more distant redeployments would give both sides more warning time in a military crisis.    Up to this point, though, the pace of conventional arms talks has been excruciatingly slow. Edouard Molitor, Luxembourg's ambassador at the MBFR talks since 1978, says only his many other duties as his country's sole official representative in Austria have saved his sanity. &quot;For one to only deal with this {MBFR} for nine years -- you couldn't stand it,&quot; he says.    Ambassador Mikhailov, who has played the Soviet Union's hand here since 1981, is more philosophical. &quot;One can reason that it is better to have 14 years of negotiations than 15 minutes of war,&quot; he says.    ---                  Confrontation in Europe   Conventional forces                                                WARSAW                                NATO              PACT Troops                      790,000           960,000 Tanks                         7,800            16,700 Tactical aircraft             1,250             2,650 Artillery pieces              3,000             9,200   Source: British Ministry of Defense</TEXT></DOC>
