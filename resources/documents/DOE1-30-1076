<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-30-1076 </DOCNO><TEXT>A programme to establish operating characteristics of nickel/hydrogencells has been devised. This has involved the measurement of charge efficienciesat different charge rates and temperatures (to be reported elsewhere).Under normal circumstances, the discharge is terminated at 1.0 V, butit is well known, at least in qualitative terms, that such cells deliverconsiderable capacity below this voltage. Thus, discharges have beencontinued to about 0.5 V, at a lower discharge rate. The capacity below1.0 V has been measured at different charge rates and different temperatures.Data show that the capacity exhibits a step change for charge inputsin excess of 100%. It is postulated that both chemical and physical changesdetermine the capacity below 1.0 V.</TEXT></DOC>
