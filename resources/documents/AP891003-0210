Securities Data Co. said Mondat that 334 acquisitions of U.S.companies worth $114.7 billion were announced during the thirdquarter. That compared with 357 transactions worth $92.3 billion inthe first quarter, and 378 deals worth $75 billion in the secondquarter.   Merger and acquisition activity has slowed as prices forcompanies has gone up and financing has been harder to come by. Thebig banks that finance deals have become more cautious, andinvestors are also more wary.   In reaching its totals, Securities Data included acquisitions ofmajority and entire interests in U.S. firms, recapitalizations,spinoffs, self-tenders and exchange offers for stock or securitiesconvertible into stock. Each transaction was worth $10 million ormore.   The figures included several major deals, including the planned$11.4 billion merger of Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp., theproposed $3.6 billion acquisition of Columbia PicturesEntertainment Inc. by Sony Corp. and the planned $4.7 billionmerger of Citizens and Southern Corp. with Sovran Financial Corp.   They also included the approximately $5.5 billion indivestitures announced by RJR Nabisco Inc. following its own $24.53billion buyout earlier this year.   So far in 1989, there have been 1,140 transactions totaling$302.5 billion, down 14 percent from the 1,256 deals totaling$353.1 billion during the first nine months of 1988, according toNewark, N.J.-based Securities Data.   The company's figures also indicate a slowing in leveragedbuyouts, those made with largely borrowed funds.   Leveraged buyouts declined to 24 deals totaling $19.9 billion inthe third quarter, compared with 47 deals worth $18.3 billion inthe first quarter and 56 transactions totaling $19.6 billion in thesecond quarter.   For the year to date, there have been 132 LBOs totaling $57.7billion, down sharply from 183 buyouts totaling $73.3 billion inthe same period a year earlier.   LBO activity is expected to continue to decline because ofuncertainty in junk bonds, a popular form of financing forleveraged buyouts. The junk bond market suffered heavy losses lastmonth after Campeau Corp. announced it was having difficultymeeting interest payments on some of its bonds.   Campeau, which relied heavily on junk bonds for its $6.6 billionbuyout of Federated Department Stores Inc. last year, has receiveda $250 million loan from Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd. so itcould make its payments.   IDD Information Services, another financial information concern,also reported a slowing of merger activity during the first threequarters of the year.   IDD, which tallied merger and acquisition activity around theworld, said 3,666 targets worth $248.53 billion were acquiredduring the first nine months of 1989, down from 4,171 targets worth$248.57 billion.   The company noted that the 1989 dollar amount was swelled by theRJR Nabisco deal. Without that transaction, the drop in terms ofdollars would have been sharper.</TEXT></DOC>
