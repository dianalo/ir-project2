Col. Oliver North,and two arms dealers on conspiracy charges in the diversion ofIranian arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   The long-awaited 23-count indictment _ which in addition toNorth and Poindexter also named retired Air Force Maj. Gen. RichardV. Secord and his business partner, Albert Hakim _ culminated a14-month grand jury investigation into the arms-for-hostages dealswith Iran and the diversion of funds to the Contras.   The grand jury said the four men ``deceitfully and without legalauthorization'' organized, directed and concealed ``a program tocontinue funding of and logistical and other support for militaryand paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by the Contras'' at a timeU.S. law barred such action.   The four defrauded the government ``by deceitfully exploitingfor their own purposes'' U.S. arms sales to Iran, ``rather thanpursuing solely the specified governmental objectives of theinitiative, including the release of Americans being held hostagein Lebanon,'' the grand jury said   One count said the defendants embezzled and converted to theirown use proceeds generated by the weapons sales to Iran. It wasreported in the indictment that the arms sales generatedapproximately $30 million, while the U.S. government was paid only$12.2 million for the weapons.   The indictment stated the conspiracy began in late spring orearly summer of 1985 and continued through at least December 1986.   The central conspiracy count charges that Poindexter, North,Secord and Hakim ``together with others known and unknown''conspired to defraud the United States by obstructing lawfulgovernment functions.   The indictment variously charged the defendants with conspiracy,theft of government property, obstruction of justice, falsestatements, falsification, destruction and removal of documents.   The indictment said the conspiracy deprived the government ``ofthe honest and faithful services of employees'' by using thepositions of Poindexter and North to generate funds for Secord andHakim.   North was named in nine counts charging him with obstruction ofCongress, making false statements, obstructing the presidentialinquiry into the Iran-Contra affair in November 1986, andconcealing, falsifying or destroying official documents.   Poindexter was named in two counts of obstructing acongressional inquiry and two other counts of false statements.   The three counts in which all four were charged _ conspiracy todefraud the United States and commit offenses against thegovernment, theft of government property and wire fraud arisingfrom the diversion of the arms sale proceeds _ carry togethermaximum penalties of 25 years' imprisonment. Each charge carries amaximum fine of $250,000.   Each of the obstruction and false statement charges againstNorth and Poindexter carries a five-year sentence and $250,000 fine.   The destruction of documents charge against North carries athree-year term.   Hakim and Secord, among other things, were charged withconspiracy to pay illegal gratuities to North and his family tofurther the sale of arms to Iran so that Secord and Hakim ``wouldcontinue to receive opportunities for substantial revenues andprofits'' from ``lucrative activities referred to them by North andfacilitated by him.''   This charge listed a series of two payments totaling $16,000 tosecurity expert, Glenn Robinette, who installed a security systemat North's home in Great Falls, Va.   The indictment also charged that Hakim created an investmentaccount containing $200,000 in a Swiss bank for the financialbenefit of the North family.   Secord and Hakim were also charged with offering an illegalgratuity to North in return for his support of the private supplynetwork for the Contras and Iran arms sales.   North was charged with receipt of an illegal gratuity stemmingfrom the installation of the security system. The charge carries atwo-year sentence and a $250,000 fine.   North was also charged with pocketing at least $4,300 of the$90,000 in traveler's checks from Contra leader Adolfo Calero. Thecharge alleged that Calero had given the traveler's checks to Northfor efforts to help release U.S. hostages in Lebanon and to helpsupport the Contras.   North was also charged with conspiracy to defraud the governmentin connection with the use of a tax-exempt foundation that raisedseveral million dollars in private donations to help arm theContras. Two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R. ``Spitz'' Channelland Richard Miller, pleaded guilty last spring to the same chargeand identified North as a co-conspirator.   Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh and several of his topprosecutors made a final presentation to the panel.   Last week, former national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane,pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that he withheld informationfrom Congress in 1985 and in 1986 about covert administrationefforts to help the Contras during the ban on direct U.S. militaryaid.   The 1985-1986 sales to Iran were part of an effort to trade armsfor U.S. hostages being held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian terroristorganizations.   Congressional investigators determined that of the $16 millionin profits from the arms sales, $3.8 million went to the Contraswhen the congressional ban on direct U.S. military aid to theNicaraguan rebels was in effect.</TEXT></DOC>
