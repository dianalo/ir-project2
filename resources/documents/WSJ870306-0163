The president will be &quot;far more visible,&quot; predicts Interior Secretary Hodel. A meeting today with U.S. arms negotiators at the White House is part of efforts to display an activist Reagan. Under consideration are one-day trips to a job-training center and a high-tech lab. County supervisors meeting in Washington may be invited to meet with the president.    But lawmakers say substantive moves rather than imagery are needed. Reagan's speech was a &quot;good start,&quot; but &quot;without a lot of action and follow-up&quot; the gain &quot;would be lost,&quot; says Florida Sen. Chiles. Skeptics doubt that the president can change his loose style of management. His efforts to restore credibility are undercut by his insistence that Regan resigned voluntarily.    On foreign policy, asserts New Hampshire Sen. Humphrey, &quot;the president needs to kick some fannies in Foggy Bottom, including the fanny with the tattoo.&quot;    PROSPECTS GROW that Volcker will be asked to stay as Fed chairman.    The odds have increased dramatically in recent days, administration insiders say. The naming of Howard Baker, a Volcker admirer, as White House chief of staff is just one factor. Officials worry that only Volcker could forge a solution with banks on the Brazil debt problem. And sagging foreign confidence in Reagan heightens the Fed chief's stature as the dollar's guardian.    The question is whether Volcker would accept reappointment. He is rumored to be a candidate for the presidency of his alma mater, Princeton, which could tempt him. For now, &quot;his mind-set is clearly not to stay,&quot; one associate says, adding: &quot;It's got to be the president himself who asks -- and he's got to be asked the right way.&quot;    ISRAEL'S ACTIONS threaten to damage its special ties with the U.S.    Administration officials seethe over Shamir's rejection of a Mideast peace conference; they had hoped for progress to take the spotlight off the Iran affair. Irritation mounts at Israel's lack of cooperation in the Pollard spy case. And the Pentagon is upset over Israel's determination to build a U.S.-financed jet fighter even if the project is over budget.    The angry U.S. mood could thwart Israel's efforts to increase its $3 billion in American aid. It also could hurt efforts to block an arms sale to moderate Arabs. Israel's supporters worry that a White House report, required by Congress, will show that Israel ships arms to South Africa. But nobody expects a major U.S.-Israeli break.    &quot;The floor under U.S.-Israeli relations,&quot; says one Arab-state lobbyist, &quot;is so thick that it can support a lot of bickering and quarreling.&quot;    IRAN-CONTRA PROBERS focus on Poindexter's role. Compared with Oliver North, the former national-security adviser is &quot;more significant in that he was closer to the president,&quot; says Maine Sen. Mitchell. Some Republicans who defended the administration are bitter that Poindexter minimized the Iran arms sales in briefings to them.    INSTANT BEST SELLER: The Tower Commission report goes into a third printing as a Bantam Books paperback, making 700,000 copies in print. The paperback, published with Times Books, &quot;is outselling the Nixon transcripts,&quot; says a Bantam official, and is Bantam's fastest-selling instant book since the Pentagon papers, which sold over one million copies.    TOGETHER AGAIN: When former Arizona Gov. Babbitt declares his Democratic presidential candidacy next Tuesday, he will be flanked by a press secretary, pollster, campaign consultant and advance man with one thing in common: In 1984, they all worked for the ill-fated presidential campaign of John Glenn.    SPREADING BUREAUCRACY: Office of Personnel Management head Constance Horner undertakes her own Central America initiative. During a trip there, she meets with the presidents of Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras to promote the virtues of a civil-service system like the U.S.'s.    DEMOCRATS PLAN closer scrutiny of Reagan's judicial nominations.    Some 20 federal-court nominations are pending and 50 more vacancies must be filled. New Senate Judiciary Chairman Biden says his committee's checks of nominees will take enough time to provide &quot;a reasoned opinion on their qualifications.&quot; Four members led by Vermont Sen. Leahy will conduct the inquiries.    Republicans accuse the Democrats of trying to derail conservative nominees. An early showdown may be over an appeals-court nomination of Bernard Siegan, a University of San Diego law professor. Liberal critics say his writings don't make clear that he agrees with the Supreme Court's 1954 school-desegregation ruling. He tells senators he supports it.    Last week's replacement of the White House counsel may slow administration review of potential court appointees.    MINOR MEMOS: John Ehrlichman, asked what he might have done differently about Watergate in light of the Iran-Contra scandal, responds, &quot;Take the Fifth.&quot; . . . Donald Regan looks for office space in Washington, reportedly to start writing a book on his White House days. . . . The Republican minority's portion of the Joint Economic Committee's annual report refers to the New Deal as &quot;histrionic.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
