The $100 million, five-year deal by Fidelity Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, California, paid 1/8 point over the three-month London interbank offered rate at par. Its pricing was about in line with notes outstanding, and the deal featured collateralization by mortgage paper and a triple-A rating by Moody's Investors Service Inc.    But apparently because of concern about unfamiliarity with the borrower's name, some syndication members opted to sell their allotments outright rather than try to place the bonds, an increasingly common practice in Eurobond syndication groups.    However, a CSFB official said the issue had attracted good first-day interest. And, noted an official of a U.S. bank that wasn't involved, &quot;There's been good retail demand for such bonds during the last three months. Given that this is triple-A paper, there's no reason it shouldn't stand up, regardless of what happened during the first day.&quot;    In secondary markets, seasoned Eurodollar bonds were nearly unchanged, although dealers described sentiment as &quot;a little firmer.&quot;    Elsewhere, seasoned Euroyen issues had been marked up as much as 3/8 point on a rise in Japanese government bonds in Tokyo. But participants took advantage of the rise and sold, erasing gains by midday. Said an official at IBJ International Ltd., &quot;Euroyen just didn't want to follow the move in governments.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
