Arenol Chemical Corporation took exception to theapplication of Radian Corporation for registration as a bulk manufacturerof amphetamine, its salts, optical isomers, and salts of its optical isomersand methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers. ArenolChemical Corporation stated that it has historically been able to meetthe medical, scientific, and industrial needs of the U.S. market for theseproducts and is willing to work with Radian Corporation to supply the quantitiesthat it may require as Arenol has done with other organizations.Radian Corporation manufactures a maximum of 5 grams of each basic classof controlled substance for which it is registered and uses these substancesto produce standards for research and analytical studies.The Deputy Assistant Administrator therefore finds that the registrationof Radian Corporation as a bulk manufacturer of amphetamine, its salts,optical isomers, and salts of its optical isomers and methamphetamine,its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers is consistent with the publicinterest because Radian Corporation manufactures these controlled substancesfor research and analytical purposes in small quantities and this activitydoes not affect the commercial market of these controlled substances.The Deputy Assistant Administrator hereby orders that the application submittedby Radian Corporation for registration as a bulk manufactuer of the basicclasses of controlled listed above be granted.<ITAG tagnum="6">Gene R.
