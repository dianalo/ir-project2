Skip's center passed about 100 miles south of Manila, sparing thecapital from the high winds and flooding that Typhoon Ruby broughttwo weeks ago.   But officials said Skip triggered tornadoes, landslides andwidespread flooding across part of the country's midsection known asthe ``typhoon belt'' _the central Visayas islands and the BicolPeninsula of Luzon island.   The government weather service said that at mid-morning Skip wasabout 150 miles southwest of Manila. Maximum sustained winds,clocked at 108 mph when Skip hit the islands Monday, weakened todayto about 93 mph as the storm crossed the Visayas, the weatherservice said.   Reports of damage and casualties from Typhoon Skip were sketchybecause of poor communications to the affected areas.   The Social Services Department said at least 400,000 people were``affected'' by the typhoon, meaning their homes or property weredamaged or destroyed. It said most were on Leyte Island, which waswithout electricity because Skip's winds blew down power lines.   Telephone operators in Manila said all lines to Leyte were downtoday.   The Office of Civil Defense said seven children were killed inflooding late Monday in the Manila suburb of Pasig, wherefloodwaters from Typhoon Ruby have still not receded.   The Red Cross said at least six people were killed Monday inCamarines Sur province on the Bicol Peninsula. They included threebodies recovered from a landslide in Pasacao about 210 milessoutheast of Manila in Camarines Sur. Twenty other people weremissing and believed buried in the slide.   The Red Cross said the other fatalities in Camarines Sur includeat least two children who died when a tornado triggered by Skip torethrough another town in Camarines Sur. One person drowned elsewherein Camarines Sur, the Red Cross said.   On Panay island, the government's Office of Civil Defense saidsix people drowned in Capiz province and two died in Aklan province.One person died on Marinduque island.   Government officials said more than 3,000 people were lefthomeless on Cebu island and altogether 20,000 were ``affected'' bythe storm. Shelters were set up in schools and churches to care forthe homeless.   On Mindoro island, the Red Cross said 80 percent of San Jose, acity of about 70,000 people, was under water today.   Skip came ashore early Monday on Samar island, 410 milessoutheast of Manila, and moved across the islands of Masbate,Romblon, Tablas and Mindoro.   Departmental spokeswoman Teresita Padua estimated damage on Leytealone at about $400,000.   In Manila, the government ordered schools closed today. Mostdomestic flights from the Manila airport were canceled butPhilippine Airlines said service would be restored by tonight.   The typhoon passed well south of the six American militaryinstallations, including Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay navalbase, where damage was reported minimal.   Skip is the 20th typhoon or tropical storm to hit the archipelagothis year. Typhoon Ruby struck Oct. 24 and tropical storm Tess sweptthrough the Visayas Islands on Saturday.   Officials said Ruby killed at least 181 people on land. At least64 others were killed and more than 200 are missing from thepassenger ship Dona Marilyn, which sank 300 miles southeast ofManila during the typhoon.   Government officials said at least 11 people were killed Saturdayduring floods caused by Tess.</TEXT></DOC>
