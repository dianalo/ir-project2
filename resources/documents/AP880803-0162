The China Youth News daily said 44 of 206 foreign-ownedcompanies or joint ventures in the southeastern city employchildren under 16 years of age _ a practice illegal in China.   Shenzhen, a growing city of half a million near Hong Kong, wasin 1980 designated one of four special economic zones for foreigninvestment. About 80 percent of its foreign capital comes from HongKong.   The daily said that among the children working in Shenzhen, morethan 1,000 were recruited from the nearby rural province ofGuangxi. The youngest was aged 10 and the oldest 16.   Against a setting of worker strikes, sexual promiscuity andunwanted pregnancies among about 250,000 women who work part-time,conditions for the children can be ``incredibly bad,'' the dailysaid.   In one factory producing silk flowers, girls as young as 12 work14 or 15 hours a day, interrupted by a few hours of sleep in a tent.   One 16-year-old girl showed a reporter a flower-shaped burn markleft on her hand by a factory machine. She said she didn't earnenough money to buy a $6 train ticket home to Guangxi.   The report said the children received $22 to $27 a month _considerably less than adults _ and that they had to pay for theirown room and board, as well as training fees.   The report did not identify the factory or the foreign investors.   Government officials in Guangxi charge $20 for false ID cardsfor children seeking work in Shenzhen, who can then claim they areof legal age, the daily said.   ``Confusion in the management of our labor system provides ahotbed for child labor,'' the report said.   It said the manufacturing industry in Shenzhen ``will graduallybecome a world of children.''   China's official press has in recent months focused on thegrowing problems of child labor, particularly in the countryside,where many parents take their children out of school and put themto work in small rural factories.</TEXT></DOC>
