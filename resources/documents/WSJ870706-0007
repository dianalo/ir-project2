Rothschild andamp; Sons Ltd. and fixed the international gold price.    But now London's bullion market is about to experience its own version of the Big Bang -- the rubric for Britain's deregulation of its financial markets last October.    Although the traditional fixing of gold's price will continue, the expanding role of other market makers will be formalized. This month the club is introducing a new business code, stamped with the regulator approval of the Bank of England. And by the end of the year 53 other firms that trade gold and silver bullion will have a voice in running the traditionally secretive market.    Bullion dealers say the five houses fixing the gold price have to respond to the needs of the market and requirements of British financial legislation. As a group the five bullion firms transact less business than outside market makers, several London bullion traders say. Unlike gold futures markets in New York and Chicago, however, the London gold market doesn't publish trading statistics.    Although gold prices sometimes fluctuate wildly in a 24-hour trading cycle, London's twice-a-day price fixing is the benchmark for the international market, says Robert Guy, a director of N.M. Rothschild and chairman of the London Gold Market.    &quot;But it is time to change,&quot; Mr. Guy says. &quot;We wish to encourage more market makers to increase liquidity, reduce volatility and create a more orderly market.&quot;    There will be two parallel sets of reform, London bullion dealers say.    First, the markets will be supervised by the Bank of England, which will set standards for recognized market makers in gold and silver bullion.    Second, the five traditional houses and a growing band of U.S., British, Swiss, German and Japanese firms that actively began trading gold in London during the past decade will form the nucleus of the London Bullion Market Association. Initially the association will include 58 members.    The association will formalize a larger gold market that has been developing for several years. However, N.M. Rothschild; Mocatta andamp; Goldsmid Ltd.; Sharps, Pixley andamp; Co., Samuel Montagu andamp; Co. and Mase Westpac Ltd. will continue their traditional role as the sole bullion banks that set the gold price.    Market makers are satisfied the fixing is limited to just five houses, says Guy Field, a vice president at Morgan Guaranty. Otherwise it would be too unwieldy to set the gold price, he says.    Besides the five houses, Morgan Guaranty; Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American Express Co.; Philipp Brothers, a unit of Salomon Inc.; Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; Credit Suisse, and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. are already market makers. Also planning to join the band are Chase Manhattan Bank, Union Bank of Switzerland, Citicorp International Bank, Deutsche Bank AG and Italian International Bank PLC. Other members will include the Japanese firms Sumitomo Corp., C Itoh andamp; Co. and Mitsui andamp; Co.    In the early seventies, bullion dealers say, Zurich was the international gold mecca, followed by London and then Hong Kong. The two leading producers, South Africa and the Soviet Union, favored Switzerland because of its political neutrality and its historical role as a haven for international funds.    Now the key trading market is London, followed by Zurich, New York and Hong Kong.    London is attracting more players, Mr. Field says, &quot;because the environment is right.&quot; A decade ago just one London-based firm outside the five traditional houses was an active trader in the physical gold market. However, as a key international financial center for foreign exchange, bond and stock trading, London is an open market, he says.    Leading Swiss banks decided to open gold divisions in London because the city is &quot;attracting vast amounts of offshore funds,&quot; Zurich-based traders say.    &quot;I am a game keeper turned poacher,&quot; says Michael Olliff-Lee, a bullion trader who was a leading participant in the gold fixing and is now an assistant vice president and head of the Union Bank of Switzerland's London trading team.    &quot;London is undoubtedly the precious metals center,&quot; he says. &quot;Our bank decided to open in London because it realized that the market was getting bigger.&quot;    While Union Bank's London office will receive orders from Zurich, Mr. Olliff-Lee says, the office intends to draw more business itself.    The London gold market, however, has had its setbacks. Only a few years ago, bullion houses and metals traders were forced to close a gold futures market that had flopped.    This year, though, gold traders are enthusiastic because price and volume have surged. And even if the market quiets, they say, there will be sufficient business for more market makers.    &quot;London's gold market grew during the eighties, a time when the market was very quiet,&quot; Mr. Field says.    Rising world production and introduction of a variety of trading instruments for producers, refiners, consumers and investors, ensured there was enough gold to go around, he says. </TEXT></DOC>
