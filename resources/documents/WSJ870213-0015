But listening to Norman, the courthouse might as well be on a different planet.    &quot;What's going on in there has nothing to do with us,&quot; he says.    Inside the courthouse, in courtroom D, 19 black men are on trial for conspiring to overthrow the South African government -- in other words, for treason. Nearly every morning for the past 13 months, these men, attired in suit jackets and ties, have been bused into town from the prison down the road, and late in the afternoon they have been bused back.    This ritual will probably continue for another 12 months or so, as one of the most significant political dramas in South Africa slowly unfolds. It is here, in this unlikely theater, where the legal limits of extraparliamentary opposition -- and perhaps the future shape of the black struggle -- will be determined.    Inside Norman's Hardware, one white man -- Norman, the proprietor -- is busy with his bookkeeping. He says he knows most everyone in town, but he's never met the 19 black men, known as the Delmas 19. They used to be the Delmas 22, but three have been acquitted. Norman never met them, either.    &quot;They have nothing to do with the town,&quot; he says. &quot;They come in the morning and go back at night. We never notice them.&quot;    One of the few times anyone did notice was when Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu visited the trial, and, as the town gossip has it, went to one of the butcher shops and bought some meat. &quot;He probably figured it was cheaper here,&quot; says Norman.    In Delmas, as in much of white South Africa, the historic, and often brutal, realities of the times are ignored by everyday life on Main Street. It is one of the most enduring deficiencies of South Africa's racially divided society that the average white person knows little about the frustration and anger festering in the neighboring black communities.    This ignorance has been encouraged through the years by apartheid's architects, who located the black townships behind hills, or far away from major highways, and who are occasionally willing to relocate them whenever they become too obvious and objectionable to white eyes. The recent state-of-emergency press restrictions, which bar reports on unrest and security force action, have furthered this isolation.    Thus, while history happens on their doorstep, the white people of Delmas, for the most part, remain blissful in their ignorance.    &quot;A treason trial? Never heard of it,&quot; says Philip Herman van Huyssteen, an elderly man going about his afternoon shopping. &quot;Who are the defendants? Are they European?&quot;    They are South African, he is told.    &quot;No, I mean are they white (European) or black,&quot; he explains. Informed that they are black, he remembers hearing something about the case once. &quot;But,&quot; he adds, &quot;I'm not paying much attention to it.&quot;    Delmas, which is located about 60 miles due east of Johannesburg, is a tidy town where everything seems to have its place. Even the public toilets on the main shopping street maintain the basic order: there's one set of facilities for whites (called Europeans on the sign outside the door) and another for non-whites. The population statistics of Delmas, which is mainly a farming community with some industrial, mining and commercial interests, are also neatly segregated. In 1983, the time of the most recent estimate, there were 5,912 whites, 87 Asians, 147 coloreds (people of mixed race) and 9,300 blacks.    Until the treason trial over at the courthouse, Delmas was just another dot on the wide open spaces of the eastern Transvaal. But to judicial experts who schedule trials, it seemed to be the ideal dot for an important black case: small and rural, so crowds could be easily noticed and controlled; and far enough away from the black townships where the defendants are well known to make travel a hardship for friends and relatives, but not too far from the big cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria for the lawyers to commute.    Since the trial started, Delmas has become a household word in many black households. For headline writers, it has pratically become inseparable from the phrase &quot;treason trial.&quot; And the town has become a curious mecca for prominent black leaders, as well as ambassadors and other representatives from most of the major Western countries, interested in the proceedings in courtroom D.    &quot;It is becoming a must that any foreign delegations to South Africa travel to Delmas,&quot; says one of the defense attorneys.    Yet, the trial hasn't changed life down on main street. &quot;Maybe we've sold a few extra Cokes and hamburgers, but that's about it,&quot; says Barney Venter, the town secretary.    The trial certainly hasn't helped sales at Russell's furniture store, which, on one recent weekday, was doing a slow business. Two white salespeople, waiting for customers, say they have never heard of the trial. &quot;But then again,&quot; says one, &quot;I don't read the newspapers much.&quot;    It wouldn't help if she did. Diane Preston, who works at the local newspaper, which is mostly ads wrapped around a few stories, says the Afrikaans-language paper carried a story on the trial several months ago. &quot;It's going on for so long,&quot; she says. &quot;This isn't the type of thing people are interested in.&quot;    A colleague at the paper says people were interested, &quot;cared, actually,&quot; at the beginning of the trial when police roadblocks disrupted downtown traffic. Since then, the barriers, on days when large crowds are expected, have been moved to points further out of town.    &quot;A murder trial would be more interesting,&quot; she says. &quot;Like the case of the woman who shot her fiancee. I think that one has been moved to Pretoria, though.&quot;    The treason trial also involves murder -- in fact five murders. The state claims that the defendants orchestrated the September 1984 uprisings in black townships south and east of Johannesburg -- part of an area known as the Vaal Triangle -- that resulted in the deaths of five black town councillors. Among the defendants are several top leaders of the United Democratic Front and other anti-apartheid community organizations. The state maintains that the UDF and its affiliates are furthering the aims of the banned African National Congress inside South Africa, and are conspiring to violently overthrow the government.    The defense argues that the UDF and its affiliates aren't connected to the ANC and are striving for the nonviolent end of apartheid. The conspiracy theory, the defense contends, has no basis because many of the defendants never met one another until they were put into the same prison cell, about a half-hour's drive from Delmas. They have been together in the single cell throughout the trial.    The trial itself moves along as slowly and persistently as the ceiling fan turning above the judges' bench. The state's evidence consumed an entire year, and the defense case, which began on Jan. 21, is expected to last just as long. One of the defendants, who was acquitted last November, was married in the courthouse during a break in the trial. Another, Moss Chikane, of the UDF, saw his newborn son for the first time when his wife brought him into the gallery.    His wife tries to make the journey to Delmas at least once a week from her home in Mamelodi, a black township near Pretoria. &quot;Transportation is a problem,&quot; she says. Her head resting in her hands, she asks, &quot;When will this end?&quot;    &quot;Even if it takes another 50 years, it is important that we go through this,&quot; says Mr. Chikane during the trial's 11 a.m. tea break. &quot;One day, people are going to remember what's going on now in Delmas.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
