A new mechanism can destabilize electrostaticwaves in the presence of a nonuniform electric field perpendicular tothe uniform ambient magnetic field. When the electric field is nonuniform,it is possible for a finite region to contain negative wave energy surroundedby regions of positive-wave energy. The ion-cyclotron instability isimportant to both space and laboratory plasma. This new mechanism isinvestigated for an instability by means of simulations in the presenceof a nonuniform electric field perpendicular to the uniform magneticfield associated with a density gradient. A two-dimensional electrostaticcode was used that retains the full dynamics of the ions in three dimensionalvelocity space. Electrons are treated by the guiding-center approximationin the perpendicular direction while the parallel motion is treated exactly.Nonlinear phenomena such as diffusion and coalescence of vortices areinvestigated. In the linear stage, smaller vortices are generated andlarger vortices with the lower frequencies are dominant in the nonlinearstage. In the nonlinear stage, ions diffuse strongly due to large-scalevortices.</TEXT></DOC>
