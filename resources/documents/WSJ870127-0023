Ronald Semler and Monty Barry Semler, brothers who partly own North Hollywood-based Associated Industries Inc., which deals in military equipment, were indicted on 27 counts last week, including conspiracy to impede the Internal Revenue Service and falsifying tax declarations. The U.S. Attorney's office said the men posted $1 million bail each.    As previously reported, the indictment alleged that the two brothers worked through a representative of the North Korean Embassy in East Berlin to ship helicopters made by Hughes Helicopter Inc. to North Korea. Hughes Helicopter was acquired in 1984 by St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. and renamed McDonnell Douglas Helicopters Inc.    U.S. and South Korean officials confirmed that North Korea has possession of 87 helicopters made by Hughes Helicopter. Federal authorities also said they prevented the Semlers from allegedly shipping 15 of the helicopters. </TEXT></DOC>
