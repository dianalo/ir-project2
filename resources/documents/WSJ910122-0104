Collier Inc. encyclopedia unit to Germanpublisher F.A. Brockhaus AG.   A spokesman for Macmillan said Robert Maxwell canceled theagreement late last week because &quot;negotiations had beeninterminable and he {Maxwell} was frustrated.&quot; Macmillan is aunit of London-based Maxwell Communication Corp., of whichMr. Maxwell is chairman.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement to sell Collier was announced inmid-October. At the time, Macmillan said it expected toconclude the deal within two months. Brockhaus seemed like agood fit because of its Langenscheidt unit, a publisher offoreign-language dictionaries and other reference books.   Since his purchase of Macmillan in 1988 for $2.6 billion,Mr. Maxwell has sold a number of assets to pare down debt.The terms of Macmillan's planned sale of Collier wereundisclosed, but the encyclopedia publisher has annual salesof about $80 million. Collier publishes the 24-volumeCollier's Encyclopedia and Merit Students Encyclopedia, andsells its Collier's encyclopedia in Britian through a U.K.unit.   Martin Maleska, an executive in charge of acquisitions anddivestitures for Maxwell-Macmillan in the U.S., said hedoesn't expect Mr. Maxwell to search for a new buyer forCollier.   &quot;Our current plan is to keep that business. We're lookingat ways to improve the business, things that had been kept inabeyance when we thought we would sell it,&quot; said Mr. Maleska.&quot;When we started to look at this back in the summer, we hadan enormous dept repayment due in October, but that has nowbeen paid.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
