Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> SCR STK </IN><G> JUS </G><TEXT>   Lawyers for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. told U.S. Justice Department officials the economy would be hurt if racketeering charges are brought against their client.    In a Monday meeting with Justice Department officials, the lawyers sought to convince government lawyers that if the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan files criminal charges related to its insider-trading investigation, those charges shouldn't include violations under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO.    Drexel's lawyers are understood to have told Justice officials that RICO charges are unwarranted. Besides claiming that their client hasn't engaged in racketeering, they argued that RICO charges would seriously disrupt the stock and bond markets, in which Drexel is a major player. They also told Justice Department officials that such charges could drive Drexel out of business because money managers and executives may not want to conduct business with a firm facing potentially stiff penalties such as forfeiture of all illegal profits and triple damages.    Meanwhile, Florida financier Victor Posner and his son, Steven, are understood to have received &quot;target letters&quot; recently from the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, formally indicating that federal prosecutors are likely to seek an indictment soon from the grand jury that has been investigating the Posners. The grand jury has been investigating the Posners, Drexel and others for possible violations of securities laws and mail and wire fraud.    However, individuals familiar with the U.S. inquiry said that if the Posners are charged with criminal wrongdoing, such charges would be brought after the government files charges against some of Drexel's current and former employees.    The government doesn't want to risk going to trial with the Posners first because it would have to produce convicted insider trader Ivan F. Boesky as a witness before Drexel's case gets to trial, according to individuals familiar with the inquiry. If Mr. Boesky testified, lawyers for Drexel and other defendants would gain insight into the case against them. Lawyers for the Posners declined to comment.    The Securities and Exchange Commission last month filed civil securities-fraud charges against Drexel, Michael Milken, the head of its junk-bond operation, three other Drexel employees and the Posners.    At Monday's Justice Department meeting, lawyers for Drexel and other defendants were told they could make written submissions explaining why racketeering charges shouldn't be brought against their clients. But no further meetings between defense attorneys and Justice Department officials are scheduled.    Some individuals familiar with the meeting said that while it seemed likely that Mr. Milken and others would be charged with racketeering, it was by no means certain that the department had decided to approve a request by the U.S. attorney to bring RICO charges against Drexel. Before the U.S. attorney can bring such charges, it first must have the permission of the Justice Department's organized-crime unit.    Lawyers for Drexel are also said to be considering appealing to higher level Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, to argue their case before charges are brought. The defense attorneys have the right to ask to meet with the attorney general, but he could deny such a request. </TEXT></DOC>
