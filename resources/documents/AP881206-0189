North's ability to disclose government secretsat trial by conceding that some covert operations financed byIranian arms sales were legal.   The concessions were made in memoranda filed at the request ofU.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, who is conducting closedhearings on the use of classified documents at a public trial.Declassified versions of the briefs were unsealed late Tuesday inU.S. District Court.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said he would not offerproof that North approved a variety of expenditures from the secretfund that was amassed from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran.   The prosecutor said he wouldn't offer evidence about payments toDrug Enforcement Administration agents to help free Americanhostages in Lebanon. Nor would there be proof that North approved$200,000 in payments to Nicaraguan rebel leaders, the spending of$320,000 to buy a Danish ship used for a variety of clandestineoperations and $100,000 to buy radios for a foreign political groupnot specified in the indictment.   Walsh said he was ``willing to concede, for the purposes of thiscase, that this group of expenditures went to programs otherwiselawful, but not within the Iran finding'' in which President Reaganapproved the arms sales to make contact with moderate elements ofIran and to free U.S. hostages.   ``The government will concede for the purposes of this trial thatnone of the expenditures went to programs which were themselvesillegal, except those for the support of the military andparamilitary activities of the Contras,'' Walsh said.   As a result of these concessions, ``the government maintains thatthe use of classified documents to demonstrate the bona fides of theprograms supported by certain of the proceeds of the Iranian armssales is unjustified in light of the government's theory of thecase,'' Walsh said.   The concessions were made after Reagan stated last week that hisadministration would not allow public disclosure of virtually any ofthe secret material that North wants to use to defend the charge heconspired to defraud the government.   White House refusal to release 40,000 pages of documents soughtby North and sensitive material censored from 395 documents Walshplans to use as prosecution exhibits threatens to scuttle thecentral charges against the former National Security Council aide.   The indictment charges that North and arms dealers Albert Hakimand retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord sold U.S. arms toIran at an inflated price to create profits, from which more than$14 million was diverted to the Nicaraguan rebels. Also indicted isformer national security adviser John M. Poindexter. The four are tobe tried separately.   Gesell is holding secret hearings on North's requests to disclosecertain classified information at the trial. The ClassifiedInformation Procedures Act provides for dismissal of charges if thegovernment refuses to release documents that are needed for a fairtrial.   Of particular concern to the Reagan administration is anyinformation about efforts to free Americans held in Lebanon bypro-Iranian groups. Walsh said earlier this year that release ofsuch information could expose hostages and others to torture ordeath.   By making the concessions that he did, Walsh apparently hopes tonarrow the focus of the case against North, thereby reducing thedefense's need to disclose classified information to defend thecharge that the former presidential aide illegally divertedU.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.   Walsh contended his concessions don't undermine the basic thrustof his case against North.   ``The crime charged ... is North's participation in a conspiracyby which he fraudulently obtained control through his officialposition, but without governmental accountability, over fundsgenerated by a United States government initiative,'' Walsh said.   ``Because this is the crime charged, it is irrelevant ... whetherhe then exercised his control in order to fund what the governmentwill concede are valid projects,'' he said.   ``The crime lies in the control that North deceitfully obtainedand maintained over those funds. The allegations of expendituresdirected by North are relevant only on the issue of control.''   ``North's crime lies in how he acquired and maintained control ofthese funds, not in the specific purposes for which he spent them,''Walsh said.   No date has been set for North's trial. Secord, Hakim andPoindexter will be tried separately after North's case is concluded.</TEXT></DOC>
