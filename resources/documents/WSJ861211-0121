This is the first step toward resolving a dispute concerning overdue Brazilian payments on Paris Club loans that has hurt the country's relationship with commercial banks.    Brazil is expected to ask Paris Club members next week to reschedule its overdue payments, despite the creditor countries' traditional requirement that a borrowing nation sign an accord with the IMF before they will revamp its debt. Brazil has contended it can't be seen negotiating with the IMF for fear of a domestic political backlash.    The U.S. has indicated it is willing to support Brazil's request, and has been sounding out other creditor countries to see if they will go along. Monetary sources said other creditors now are expected to agree.    Separately, the IMF board will decide next week who will replace Jacques de Larosiere as managing director.    The 22-member panel is slated to vote on the issue next Thursday, choosing between Bank of France governor Michel Camdessus and Dutch Finance Minister H. Onno Ruding. By tradition, the head of the 151-country IMF is a European. Indications are that the directors will choose Mr. Camdessus.    Usually, European finance ministers would pick the managing director, but they referred the issue to the executive board because they couldn't agree. The Reagan administration has remained neutral so far, but is expected to support Mr. Camdessus if the board vote takes place as scheduled. Mr. Ruding has been a vocal critic of Treasury Secretary James Baker's global debt plan and of U.S. economic policy. </TEXT></DOC>
