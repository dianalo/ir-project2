The primary reasons for this increase are: (1) greateroutput per man/day (30 tons for surface mining compared to 12 tons fordeep mining); (2) lower median operating costs (18.00/ton in strip miningand $37.00/ton in deep mining): (3) greater rate of recovery (90% instrip mining compared to 50% in deep mining); and (4) the rate of fatalitiesis five times lower in surface mining than it is for deep mining. Inthe past, surface mining caused the destruction of land resources, pollutionof streams, contamination of ground water aquifers, along with otherenvironmental problems. Surface mines, however, can be reclaimed in amanner that will stabilize the site while at the same time encouragenatural succession. In this paper, the various reclamation alternativesare examined in light of ecological processes and future land use decisions.</TEXT></DOC>
