This study is an explorationof the contribution renewable resources might make to the Dutch energysupply. The resulting report is a summary of the study. A projectionhas been made for the period up to the year 2050. Several aspects arediscussed which have to be taken into account to make the projection.Nine scenarios were drawn up to explore the limits of the contributionof renewable energy to the future energy supply confrontation of threepolicy opinions with three economic developments resulted in the ninescenarios. The scenario methodology is dicussed too. The compilationof the scenarios, which was accomplished on the basis of separate studies,carried out to cover the energy issue as completely as possible, is presented.Nine outlines of the possible energy supply around 2050 resulted fromthe scenario methodology used. General conclusions are drawn on the basisof these outlines about the future energy demand and the way in whichit can be fulfilled, and particularly about the role of renewable energy.Conclusions are presented with regard to energy demand, fossil sourcesand nuclear energy, renewable resources, energy costs and savings, supplysystems and energy policy. 15 figs., 35 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
