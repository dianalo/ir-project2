The action, conducted by the commission inspector generalDavid Williams, is unusual and throws at least someuncertainty on Seabrook's full-power start-up timetable. Butsome analysts remain optimistic that the investigationprobably won't lead to a revocation of Seabrook's license.</LP><TEXT>   The $6.6 billion power plant, in Seabrook, N.H., hasdemonstrated an ability to operate at 100% capacity in trialruns and is ready for regular full-power production.   The Seabrook plant is owned by 11 New England utilities,including Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, with a 35.6%stake. PS New Hampshire filed for bankruptcy-law protectionin 1988 because it couldn't service its Seabrook debt.Another Seabrook holder, Northeast Utilities, has agreed toacquire PS New Hampshire in a deal valued at about $2.3billion.   &quot;This comes at a very awkward time for Seabrook, and itputs the financial community in a cautious mode,&quot; said DanielScotto, a bond analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corp. &quot;It's a hard one to call. We don't reallyhave any precedent of NRC investigative activity to go by.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of PSNew Hampshire and Northeast Utilities were unchanged at$2.625 and $19.75, respectively.   In 1981 the commission conducted an investigation ofseismic safety designs for the Diablo Canyon Nuclear PowerPlant in Northern California. That resulted in a temporarysuspension of a low-power testing license the facility hadreceived. The plant eventually received a full operatinglicense.   &quot;I'd be very surprised if the Seabrook investigation leadsto anything serious,&quot; said Paul Parshley, a bond analyst atLehman Brothers. &quot;The momentum was clearly on the side ofSeabrook, and I don't think anyone would have wanted tojeopardize {getting} a license by doing somethinginappropriate at the time.&quot;   A public report of the investigation is expected to beissued in about a month.   If the inspector general finds wrongdoing, he canrecommend certain actions to the full commission, which willdecide whether or not to act on his findings.   At issue in the licensing inquiry is whether there was anywrongdoing by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, anadvisory group to the commission. The board's recommendationthat Seabrook be licensed was made public on Nov. 13, 1989.But, according to a memorandum from the board's chairman,Ivan Smith, Mr. Williams hypothesizes that the licensingboard, only four days earlier, decided not to recommend anoperating license.   The memo, released by the commission this week, said Mr.Williams is trying to determine whether the reversal &quot;wascorruptly induced by NRC officers and corruptly made bymembers of the licensing board.&quot; Messrs. Smith and Williamshave confirmed the investigation, but wouldn't comment on it.   A Seabrook spokesman said the licensing was recommendedNov. 9 and that the recommendation wasn't made public untilNov. 13.   Anti-nuclear activists note that if the licensing boardrecommended licensing on Nov. 9, it came only two days afterthe Atomic and Safety Appeals Board, another NRC committee,outlined aspects of evacuation plans that still neededaddressing.   They included identifying and mapping evacuation plans forcritically ill patients and other disabled persons livingwithin a 10-mile radius; providing shelter for beachgoers whomight be stranded; and reaching an agreement with teachersfor the care of school children. Most of these issues haven'tbeen resolved.   &quot;None of these issues could have been adequately addressed{during the two days} between the appeals board order and thetime of the licensing recommendation,&quot; said Robert Backus, anattorney for the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League, a Seabrookopponent.</TEXT></DOC>
