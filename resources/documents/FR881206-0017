General License G-COCOM is designedfor exports to COCOM countries and countries designated as qualifying forfull benefits under section 5(k) of the EAA. General License G-COCOM wouldauthorize exports of those commodities described in Supplement No. 2 toPart 771, and those commodities eligible for General License G-COM or GFW.Supplement No. 2 to Part 771 lists commodities that could have been exportedto the People's Republic of China with only notification to other COCOMgovernments as of the date of enactment of the Trade Act.Some commodities are ineligible for General License G-COCOM because theyare controlled for other than national security reasons or because theirexport requires more than mere notification to COCOM.This procedure would not authorize exports or reexports to entities thatthe exporter or reexporter knows or has reason to know are controlled-in-factby countries in Country Groups Q, W, Y or Z. BXA is seeking a means ofassisting exporters and reexporters in identifying such entities. Amongthe options that will be considered is a full or partial list of entitiesknown to BXA. Comments on this aspect of the proposal are encouraged.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments should be received by January 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments (six copies) should be sent to: PatriciaMuldonian, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,Department of Commerce, P.O.

Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning orsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysiswas prepared.2. The rule does not contain a collection of information subject to therequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). As a result of this rule, a reduction of paperwork burdenon the public is anticipated. Affected OMB controlled collection actionsinclude 0694-0005, 0694-0007, and 0694-0010.3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C 603(a)and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has tobe or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Because this rule does not imposenew controls, it is not subject to section 13(b) of the Export AdministrationAct. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemakingand an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule.However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations,this rule is issued in proposed form and comments will be considered inthe development of final regulations. Accordingly, the Department encouragesinterested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possibletime to permit the fullest consideration of their views.The period for submission of comments will close January 23, 1989. TheDepartment will consider all comments received before the close of thecomment period in developing final regulations. Comments received afterthe end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but theirconsideration cannot be assured. The Department will not accept publiccomments accompanied by a request that part or all of the material be treatedconfidentially because of its business proprietary nature or for any otherreason. The Department will return such comments and will not considerthem in the development of final regulations. All public comments on theseregulations will be a matter of public record and will be available forpublic inspection and copying. In the interest of accuracy and completeness,the Department requires comments in written form. Oral comments must befollowed by written memoranda, which will also be a matter of public recordand will be available for public review and copying. Communications fromagencies of the United States Government or foreign governments will notbe made available for public inspection.The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in theBureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records InspectionFacility, Room 4086, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and PennsylvaniaAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, includingwritten public comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oralcommunications, may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulationspublished in Part 4 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Informationabout the inspection and copying of records at the facility may be obtainedfrom Margaret Cornejo, Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of InformationOfficer, at the above address or by calling (202) 377-2593.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Parts 771, 774, and 786</ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, Parts 771, 774, and 786 of the Export Administration Regulations(15 CFR Parts 768-799) are proposed to be amended as follows:1.
