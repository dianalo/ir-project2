Bush, speaking before the annual luncheon of The AssociatedPress, introduced the topic by saying he wanted to ``say a wordabout Terry Anderson,'' chief Middle East correspondent of the AP,who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   ``I just want to say without being able to give you any goodnews that we are concerned; we will follow every intelligence lead;we will go the extra mile to do what we can,'' he said.   ``We will continue to keep this question of the hostages on thefront burner,'' the president said.   Anderson, the longest held hostage, is among nine Americans theState Department says are held in Lebanon. The others are ThomasSutherland, Frank Reed, Joseph James Cicippio, Edward Austin Tracy,Jesse Turner, Robert Polhill, Alann Steen and William Higgins.   Anderson, 41, has been seen or heard from only in pictures andvideotapes released by his captors and in news from freed hostages.   At a ceremony in Washington last month marking the fourth yearsince his kidnapping, the State Department issued a statementsaying: ``The hostage holders should release their captivesimmediately and unconditionally, and we call on all countries withinfluence over the hostages, such as Iran, to use that influence toobtain freedom for all the hostages.''   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, who has led private efforts on hisbehalf, said in March he was ``frustrated, tired and lonely ... andtired of being caged like an animal.''   Officials say the hostages are held by various factions but thatall are elements of the umbrella group Hezbollah over which Iranexhibits control.   Reacting to Bush's statement Monday, Ms. Say said, ``it's adifficult place to be, to hear that we have no good news after morethan four years. It's a little disheartening. At the same time, Ican only hope that the hostages will be a major priority of thisadministration.''   ``I think one of the hardest tings for the families to accept isthat there doesn't seem to be any sense of urgency,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
