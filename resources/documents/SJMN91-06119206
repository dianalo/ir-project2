In fact, it was a pick theyhad to make.;    &quot;If he wasn't there, we would have been in trouble,&quot; said TomBoisture, the Giants' director of player personnel. &quot;We would not have gottena quality receiver.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MCCAFFREY AN EASY PICK  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  VoicesNFL Report  </MEMO><TEXT>     Boisture said the Giants were close to taking McCaffrey in the second roundinstead of linebacker Kanavis McGhee.;    Boisture said the Giants wereimpressed with McCaffrey's 4.6-second speed over 40 yards, which makes him asfast as first-round picks Alvin Harper of Tennessee and Herman Moore ofVirginia.;    &quot;Plus he's 6-5,&quot; Boisture said. &quot;I could even throw a pass outthere and hit him.&quot;;  DOMINO EFFECT: Raghib &quot;Rocket&quot; Ismail's decision to signwith the Canadian Football League could mean lower-than-expected salaries forfirst-round picks, which some agents don't like.;    Dallas settled withdefensive tackle Russell Maryland, the No. 1 pick, for $7.9 million over fiveyears, an average of just under $1.6 million a year. The Colts' Jeff George,the No. 1 pick in 1990, will average more than $2 million on his six-yeardeal. Of course, George is a quarterback.;    Agents don't like Maryland'sdeal because the No. 1 pick sets the tone for the rest of the draftees, whousually follow in slots, according to the order in which they were picked.; POLICE BLOTTER: Several draft picks have had recent scrapes with the law, butnone quite so recent as Denver third-rounder Keith Traylor.;    Regarded asthe top prospect at inside linebacker, Traylor was arrested the night beforelast Sunday's draft for disorderly conduct. Denver said it was unaware ofTraylor's arrest.;  DOUBLE JEOPARDY? Bengals cornerback Lewis Billups, whofinished a jail sentence last week for pointing a gun at a police officer,said he needed some time to recover from being held in solitary confinementfor a month in the Hamilton County Justice Center in Cincinnati.;    SoBillups decided to skip Friday's workout. That will cost him a fine, theBengals said.;    &quot;I'd probably have done the same thing,&quot; teammate BarneyBussey said. &quot;It's going to be a hard thing to look at guys after goingthrough something like that.&quot;;  BUCKING THE ODDS: Denver has hired asign-language and lip-reading interpreter to assist Kenny Walker, a defensivelineman/linebacker from Nebraska who was the Broncos' seventh-round pick.Walker is deaf.;    In 1973, the Cardinals drafted defensive lineman BonnieSloan of Austin Peay, who was also deaf. Sloan started the first game of hisrookie season but was injured most of the year. He was released in thefollowing training camp.;  ODDS AND ENDS: Mike Sullivan, an offensive linemanfrom Miami (Fla.) drafted in the sixth round by Dallas, failed his physicalbecause of a lower-back problem and will not play for the Cowboys, clubofficials said. . . . . . . 49ers/former Nebraska fullback Tom Rathman hasdonated $25,000 to Nebraska for a scholarship fund targeted to the fullbackposition. He also pledged to give $25,000 more each year for up to 10 years,or as long as his professional career lasts. . . . Bears Coach Mike Ditka onsecond-round pick Chris Zorich, a nose tackle from Notre Dame: &quot;He's exactlythe same height almost as the guy (Maryland) picked first in the draft, andhe's in much better physical shape. . . . They got their guy. We got ours.He's a Bear. There's short Bears, too, you know. Sometimes they're themeanest.&quot;;  QUOTABLE: Five years ago, Tampa Bay tight end Bennie Jennings wasworking with his father on a construction site. While operating a backhoe, hehit an electrical line. Jennings was tossed 10 feet as 1,500 volts coursedthrough his body. Only his father's ability to administer CPR saved his life.Jennings still bears burn marks on his feet.;    &quot;I wish it had made mefaster,&quot; he said, &quot;but it didn't.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910428  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  673  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday April 28, 199100119206,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
