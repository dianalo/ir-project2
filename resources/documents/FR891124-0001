The Mediterraneanfruit fly (Medfly) can cause serious economic losses. Heavy infestationscan cause complete loss of crops, and losses of 25 to 50 percent are notuncommon. The short life cycle of this pest permits the rapid developmentof serious outbreaks.A document effective August 23, 1989, and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 29, 1989 (54 FR 35629-35635, DocketNumber 89-146), established the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations andquarantined an area in Los Angeles County, California (7 CFR 301.78 <T3>et</T3> <T3>seq</T3>.; referred to below as the regulations). In an interim ruleeffective September 14, 1989, and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 20, 1989 (54 FR 38643-38645, DocketNumber 89-169), we amended the regulations by adding a portion of SantaClara County, California, to the list of quarantined areas. Also, in aninterim rule effective October 11, 1989, and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 17, 1989 (54 FR 42478-42480, DocketNumber 89-182), we amended the regulations by adding an additional portionof Los Angeles County and a portion of San Bernardino County in Californiato the list of quarantined areas. These areas remain infested with Mediterraneanfruit fly.The regulations impose restrictions on the interstate movement of regulatedarticles from quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the Mediterraneanfruit fly to noninfested areas.Recent trapping surveys by inspectors of California State and county agenciesand by inspectors of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, aunit within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, reveal that additionalinfestations of Medfly have been discovered in Los Angeles County, California.Specifically, inspectors collected four adult Mediterranean fruit fliesin Los Angeles County, near Sylmar, California, during the period of October25, 1989, to November 5, 1989.The regulations in andSection; 301.78-3 provide that the Administrator ofthe Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service shall list as a quarantinedarea each State, or each portion of a State, in which the Mediterraneanfruit fly has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator hasreason to believe the Mediterranean fruit fly is present, or that the Administratorconsiders necessary to regulate because of its inseparability for quarantineenforcement purposes from localities in which the Mediterranean fruit flyhas been found.In accordance with these criteria, we are designating as a quarantinedarea the following area in Los Angeles County, California:Los Angeles County<ITAG tagnum="21">That portion of the county in the Sylmar area bounded by a line drawnas follows: Beginning at the intersection of Balboa Boulevard and FoothillBoulevard; then easterly and southerly along Foothill Boulevard to itsintersection with Maclay Avenue; then southwesterly along this avenue toits intersection with Interstate Highway 5; then northwesterly along thishighway to its intersection with San Fernando Mission Boulevard; then southwesterlyalong this boulevard to its intersection with Woodley Avenue; then northwesterlyalong this avenue to its intersection with Balboa Boulevard; then northeasterlyalong this avenue to the point of the beginning.</ITAG>There does not appear to be any reason to designate other additional quarantinedareas in California other than the areas specified above. California hasadopted and is enforcing regulations imposing restrictions on the intrastatemovement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposedon the interstate movement of regulated articles under this subpart. EmergencyActionJames W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that an emergency situation exists, which warrantspublication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment.Because the Mediterranean fruit fly could be spread to noninfested areasof the United States, it is necessary to act immediately to prevent itsspread.Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this interimrule are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under theseconditions, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effectiveupon signature. We will consider comments received within 60 days of publicationof this interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. After the comment period closes, we will publishanother document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, including a discussion of any comments we receiveand any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export marketsFor this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291.This regulation affects the interstate movement of regulated articles fromportions of Los Angeles County, California. Approximately 61 entities willbe affected by this rule. All would be considered small entities. Theyinclude 37 groceries, 14 nurseries, 1 swap meet, 1 community garden, 3vegetable/farm gardens, 3 citrus groves, and 2 olive groves. These entitiescomprise less than 1 percent of the total of similar enterprises operatingin the State of California. Most of the sales for these entities are localintrastate and would not be affected by this regulation. Further, the conditionsin the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations and treatments in the PlantProtection and Quarantine Treatment Manual, incorporated by reference inthe regulations, allow interstate movement of most articles without significantadded costs.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The regulations in this subpart contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.
