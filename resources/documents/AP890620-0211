VHS-Beta, $89.95. RatedPG-13.)      ``Stealing Home,'' with its baseball underpinnings, is a sweetlittle tale of coming-of-age in middle-class America, a place withproms and summer at the beach.   It's good stuff for a family Saturday night viewing, but youmight need a bit of parental guidance for the younger set.   Mark Harmon stars as the would-be baseball hero and Jodie Fosteras a free spirit who commits suicide. She was his baby sitter as achild and sometime lover as a young adult.   But there are two major problems with the film.   The first is that Foster's character, Katy Chandler, never reallygets a chance to develop. We see far too little of her in the movieto really understand her motivation and direction or to explain hersuicide.   The other problem is the overwhelming use of flashbacks. Thewhole thing is a flashback, with flashbacks inside the flashback,which really jumbles the timing.   The story unwinds through Harmon, who daydreams as he sits on aminor league bench. Harmon, as Billy, the charming all-American kid,does a neat job of coming back from a ne'er-do-well to cleancutbaseball player after he returns home to dispose of Katy's ashes.   The daydream proceeds through the odyssey of growing up and, ofcourse, the greatest of all youthful experiences _ stealing homefrom third base.   _ By Chris French, Associated Press Writer</TEXT><TEXT>      ``Torch Song Trilogy'' (RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video.VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R.)      ``There are easier things in life,'' says Arnold, as he sits athis dressing table making up to perform as Virginia Hamm, ``thanbeing a drag queen. But you see, I ain't got no choice. ... I can'twalk in flats.''   And, throughout ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' it's clear there areeasier things than living openly as a homosexual who demands thelove and respect of the people he loves.   But Arnold Beckoff (Harvey Fierstein) persists, and his joys andsorrows make a funny and moving film, adapted from the Broadway playfor which Fierstein received acting and writing Tony awards.   As Arnold searches for domestic happiness, first with a bisexualteacher (Brian Kerwin) who cannot commit, then with a young model(Matthew Broderick) who is only too happy to do so, it becomes clearhis toughest challenge is his mother.   Arnold performs at Club East 4th, a good-natured club of femaleimpersonators who act as surrogate family to one another in pre-AIDSNew York. He hopes for a spouse and to adopt a child.   Fierstein does not avoid or minimize the pain Arnold causes hisparents or the pain they cause him.   ``It kills me to think they look at me and wonder what they didwrong,'' he says one day to his brother. ``You call this a life, Icall it a sickness,'' his mother (Anne Bancroft) screams at onepoint.   Arnold is streetwise and vulnerable, and Fierstein is capable ofan amazing range of facial expression. His performance is moving andendearing. Broderick and Bancroft also are excellent, directed byPaul Bogart.   _ By Mary MacVean, Associated Press Writer.</TEXT><TEXT>      ``Daffy Duck's Quackbusters'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta,$19.98.)      Adult Merrie Melodies mavens will be disappointed by ``DaffyDuck's Quackbusters,'' a newly animated feature-length video thatstrings together snippets of old Daffy classics with newer materialmeant to be a send-up of ``Ghostbusters.''   This formula is already familiar on television, as Bugs BunnyChristmas or Thanksgiving shows or the like.   But the sad result is that you have cartoon classics, with theirsophisticated wit and superior animation and voice characterization,patched together by fair-to-middling new animation.   The satiric bite that made Warner Bros. cartoons fun for all agesis now largely missing. ``Daffy Duck's Quackbusters'' is OK for thekids, but for adults there are certainly better video anthologiesaround.   Even more sadly, what everyone will notice is that Daffy justdoesn't sound like his zany self. Nor do the other characters likePorky and Bugs. The great Mel Blanc, who has been the voice ofnearly all the Warner Bros. cartoon characters for some 50 years, isnow 80.   Unfortunately, this 1980s vintage Daffy seems like the pug whodidn't know when to hang up the gloves.
