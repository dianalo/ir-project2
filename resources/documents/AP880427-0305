Chairman Lee A.Iacocca, experts say.   There seems to be an understanding among workers that executivesare paid reasonably, although Japanese bosses don't have to reporttheir incomes publicly and often enjoy valued benefits not includedin paychecks, ranging from limousines to golf course memberships.   ``Japanese top executives are not making huge sums of money likesome of their American counterparts,'' said an official of theFederation of Japan Automobile Workers' Union, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   ``I've never heard of pay for executives being used as astrategy for any labor negotiation. It is also taken for grantedthat in case of a business slump, executives voluntarily cut theirpay by about 10 percent before resorting to such measures as layingoff workers,'' he said.   Some U.S. compensation experts say it's difficult to comparepayscales for executives in different countries. One reason Japan'sexecutives have lower pay than their American counterparts is thesharply higher Japanese tax rate.   ``Look at a country like England, where executive compensationis quite low in cash, but's that because they have a prohibitivetax structure. So they give it in perks. Same in Japan,'' saidCharles Peck, a compensation specialist at the Conference Board, aNew York-based business research group. ``Studies in internationalcompensation are just too difficult.''   Nevertheless, pay levels for Japanese executives became an issuein the United States during recent labor negotiations at ChryslerCorp. The United Auto Workers, criticizing the multimillion-dollarpay received by top Chrysler executives, particularly Iacocca, saidit would adopt Japanese-style production methods if Chryslerexecutives accepted a Japanese-style pay system.   Unlike the United States, in Japan the salaries of topexecutives are considered private, even in publicly held companies.Private research companies estimate the figures.   Estimates compiled by Seikei Kenkyujo, a private researchcompany, put the average yearly pay for presidents of major vehiclemanufacturers at about 26.25 million yen ($211,700) and that ofchairmen at 18.30 million yen ($147,600).   For electrical firms, an average president is paid theequivalent of $180,500, while a chairman receives $169,500.   The figures from Seikei Kenkyujo include cash compensation andbonus payments, but not money earned through stock dividends orcapital gains.   An average Japanese automobile firm worker earns about $31,000in salary and bonuses and electric firm workers about $29,400.   Statistics suggest that the average president of a Japaneseautomobile or electrical firm earns about six or seven times morethan his workers.   In another widely publicized difference from the United States,Japanese workers and executives seldom move to another company, andhigh achievers move steadily up through the ranks.   ``In Japan, it is very rare for companies to bring someone fromother companies and appoint him as a new president or chairman,paying outrageous sums of money,'' said Hiroyuki Kikuya of the Wageand Income Research Institute, a private institute.   Pay for a top Japanese executive is set in accordance with thecompany's regular pay scale based on seniority, he said.   Kikuya also noted that in Japan not much attention is paid tohow much an individual contributes to a company, unlike the norm inthe United States where top executives are expected to make astronger personal impact on their firms.   ``Emphasis is always on the company as a whole, and therefore itis natural that the company's success is not reflected in whatexecutives earn,'' Kikuya said.   ``There might be some who are using company cars, live incompany-owned houses, keep maids or buy golf club memberships withcompany expenses, but even if these expenses are counted as theirincome, I don't think they add up to much,'' he said.   The National Tax Admimistration Agency announces the names ofthe top 100 taxpayers each year. The list contains many top companyexecutives but does not say how much they earn or their taxableincome.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday May 1</NOTE></DOC>
