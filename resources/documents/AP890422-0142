Wright, according to a report by the ethics panel's generalcounsel, put a ``hold'' on a bill in late 1986 to provideregulators $15 billion through special fees on the industry toclose the most critically insolvent savings and loan institutions,many of them in Texas.   During the same period, Wright was meeting with officials of theFederal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the thrift industry,on behalf of four Texas businessmen _ two of them Democratic Partyfund-raisers _ deeply embroiled in the Sandamp;L crisis.   Despite split votes by the ethics committee clearing Wright ofspecific violations of House rules in those meetings, specialcounsel Richard Phelan concluded Wright exercised ``undueinfluence'' in two of the cases and in trying to get two of theBank Board's toughest regulators fired.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soviet defense spending rose 3 percent lastyear, despite President Mikhail S.

The newly declassified report painted a grim overall picture ofthe Soviet economy. It said Gorbachev had been forced to slow thepace of his economic reforms and to delay such key steps asallowing the market to set wholesale and retail prices.</TEXT><DATELINE>SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   San Quentin Prison, for more than acentury one of the toughest places in the nation to do time, hasbeen emptied of virtually all its most hardened criminals.   Some 1,750 of them, more than half the population of the137-year-old fortress that once held Charles Manson and SirhanSirhan, have been sent to new prisons throughout California as partof a $5 billion prison expansion.   In their place are minimum- and medium-security prisoners,including many who live in trailers outside the prison walls on SanQuentin's fenced-in grounds and have little contact with thehigher-risk inmates inside.   California's Death Row remains here for the 252 prisoners, allmen, facing execution by cyanide gas. But aside from them, ``wehave lost almost all of our hard-core (inmates),'' said prisonspokesman Cal White, not unhappily.</TEXT></DOC>
