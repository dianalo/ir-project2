The expanded software will extend memory capabilities to allowprograms to work together more efficiently, starring a featurecalled ``virtual memory.''   Virtual memory will extend the user's available memory bytreating the hard disk as if it were part of internal memory.   Apple is planning to offer the new System 7.0 to softwaredevelopers by the end of the year, the company said.   Other features include a new print architecture connected todifferent printers and other devices made by companies other thanApple _ an apparent move away from Apple's past efforts to maintainthe proprietary nature of its technology.   ``That must have been a tough decision,'' said Nick Arnett, ananalyst with Creative Strategies Research International, a SiliconValley market research company. ``It may hurt their priinterbusiness, but it will strengthen the Macintosh by giving it manymore options.''</TEXT></DOC>
