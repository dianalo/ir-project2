Struck by a debilitating case of regionalitis -- undue empathy for the people you study, putting their version of events and interests above your own country's -- some wrote as if Iran's arms-for-hostage barter meant that further American concessions would be rewarded.    Mr. Clawson is correct -- U.S. pressure has created whatever leverage exists with Tehran. He is also right that Washington is complacent about ending the war. Correct, too, Washington is doing a lot for Iraq, but not quite getting a fair return.    U.S. policy is hard to understand. When I have suggested Iraq should support America's Arab-Israeli diplomacy, some officials have said Washington does not want to ask that. It is neutral between Iran and Iraq. U.S. activity aims at defending Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Asking Baghdad for anything much would imply abandoning neutrality -- and hope for Iran after the ayatollah.    Defending Saudi Arabia and Kuwait is fine; it keeps oil prices down. But both are too weak to support U.S. Middle East policy, and Washington should be getting more for its efforts in the gulf.    Iraq can afford to be more forthcoming than either. Firm U.S. support for an end to the war, as embodied in U.N. Resolution 598, should be reciprocated by Iraqi support for Egypt and Jordan, that is for the peace process.    Moreover, when Iran finds itself alone in the embrace of the Russian bear, it will likely see advantage in dealing fair with Washington. The obsession with conciliating Tehran assures Iran it can play Washington against Moscow, and the Soviets, who have normal relations with Iran, come out better in that game.    Laurie Myrole   Assistant Professor of Government   Harvard University   Cambridge, Mass.   ---   I wish to correct an inaccuracy contained in Mr. Clawson's article. He states that &quot;the U.S. vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the use of chemical weapons.&quot; This assertion is wrong. The U.S. has never blocked, and has never sought to block, Security Council action on the use of chemical weapons.    Here are the facts. On May 9, 1988, the U.S. voted for Security Council Resolution 612, which vigorously condemns the use of chemical weapons and calls for strict observance of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 banning their use. The resolution also incorporates a call to all states to control the export to Iraq and Iran of chemical products used to produce these horrible weapons, a prohibition already in force in the U.S.    In addition, in an address to the General Assembly on June 13, Secretary George Shultz called upon all states to live up to their responsibility to bring pressure to bear on offending states. The U.S. will continue to lead that effort.    Vernon A. Walters   U.S. Representative to the U.N.    New York</TEXT></DOC>
