Manuel AntonioNoriego put down an attempted coup by a small rebel force Tuesday,retaking the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces after asix-hour gunfight.   ``This incident corresponds to the permanent aggression of U.S.forces against the tranquillity of our country. The proof is thatU.S. forces closed access routes to the barracks,'' Noriega said ina television statement from Defense Forces headquarters after thefighting sputtered to an end.   Noriega later stepped out of his headquarters with severalfellow officers and waved to reporters but made no statement.   The rebels ``surrendered to General Noriega in person,'' saidDefense Forces spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez. He said ``more than60'' rebel troopers and four or five officers had been detained.The Defense Forces serves as both the military and police and has atotal strength of about 15,000 members.   Rebel troops seized the headquarters in an attack launchedaround 7 a.m. but failed to capture Noriega. Troops loyal to thegeneral, who commands the Defense Forces and controls thegovernment, launched a counterattack and by 1 p.m. the shooting hadtapered off as Noriega's backers gained the upper hand. Noriegaappeared on television around 4 p.m.   The United States, which has been trying to oust Noriega sincehe was indicted nearly two years ago in Florida on drug charges,denied any involvement in the coup attempt. The uprising waslaunched by junior Defense Forces officers.   U.S. troops assigned to the Panama Canal Zone took up positionsabout 600 yards from the headquarters, placed between the fightingat the compound and U.S. installations at Fort Amador and QuarryHeights. However, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command saidthe American troops took no part in the fighting and weredispatched for security reasons.   It was the second time in 18 months that Noriega had survived acoup attempt by his own officers.   In a radio broadcast after the rebels seized the headquartersthe insurgents claimed Noriega had been ousted, but loyal forcessoon took control of the broadcast networks.   ``We want to underline that the situation in the country hasbeen duly controlled to guarantee the peace and tranquillity thatthe state should assure for its citizens,'' said a statementreleased by Justice and Interior Minister Olmedo Miranda.   It declared an 8 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew and said the news mediacould report only official statements on the revolt.   Guillermo Ford, an opposition candidate for vice president inthe May 7 election, was interviewed in New York on CBS Evening Newsand asked about the foiled coup.   ``I think Noriega's going to get stronger regarding thePanamanian people,'' Ford said. ``He's been holding them hostagefor the last two years.   International observers at the May 7 balloting said theopposition slate won by a substantial margin but theNoriega-controlled government annulled the election.   Panama's provisional president, Francisco Rodriguez, speaking tothe U.N. General Assembly in New York, said the attempted coupagainst his government had been crushed.   Rodriguez, in his midafternoon address, did not accuse theUnited States of complicity in the revolt but said Washington hadundermined his nation with ``financial terrorism, economicblackmail and political interference.''   A small group of Defense Forces had tried to overthrow Noriegain March 1988, but that attempt also was crushed quickly by forcesloyal to the general.   The United States has been been applying pressure on Panama,including economic sanctions, in an effort to force Noriega to stepdown.   The rebels' claimed in a broadcast around noon that they hadoverthrown Noriega and retired top officers, but that communiquewas not repeated.   An officer loyal to Noriega later said the general was at anundisclosed location controlling the operations against theinsurgents.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday afternoon inWashington that officials had heard early ``rumblings'' of theuprising. He said later it appeared that Noriega's forces ``areback in control.''   A communique by loyalists, read over Channel 2 television, said,``The nationalist officers of all ranks and in all the barrackscountrywide have confirmed their loyalty to the fatherland ... andto our Commander-in-Chief Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.''   ``The few who allowed themselves to fall prey to cowardice, toforeign money and to treason are a minority who advocated foreignintervention,'' the communique added. ``In the next few hours, thisgroup will appear before justice, covered with shame.''   Several ambulances were seen leaving the area, and witnessessaid there were some dead and wounded, but the number of casualtieswas not immediately known.   Troops of the Southern Command were put on Delta Alert, thehighest level of readiness.   About 12,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in Panama, many withinfive miles of Panama City. All U.S. civilian dependents were movedonto U.S. military installations July 1 because of violence thatfollowed Panamanian elections held May 7. Noriega nullified theresults of the vote, which showed the opposition winning.   President Bush told reporters in Washington: ``There were rumorsaround that this was some American operation, and I can tell youthat is not true. Nobody's sure what's happening there.''   Rebels managed to gain control of the military headquarters in acongested part of downtown Panama City. Those loyal to Noriega thenwent to the roofs of surrounding buildings, hurling grenades andfiring mortars and small arms into the compound.   Several hours of gunfire inside and outside the headquarterspreceded the rebel broadcast that said the entire high command wasforced into retirement by middle-ranking officers led by Maj.Moises Giraldi Vega, head of the Urraca battalion that handlessecurity at Defense Forces headquarters.   The radio said the communique announcing a coup was signed byGiraldi, Capt. Javier Licona of the cavalry and Capt. Jesus GeorgeBalma of the special forces.   ``This is strictly a military movement. There is no politicsinvolved,'' the communique said, referring to the civilianopposition alliance that has been trying to oust Noriega with U.S.help.   An hour after the statement was read, a man who identifiedhimself as Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, said on pro-Noriega Channel2 television that loyalists ``were ready to give their lives todefend Gen. Noriega. This is a betrayal.''   Castrejon, who identified himself as a spokesman for pro-Noriegaforces, said Noriega remained in control of air and naval units andof Battalion 2000, a special unit created to defend the PanamaCanal after it is turned over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.   Noriega inherited command of the military from Gen. OmarTorrijos, who seized power in 1968 and was killed in a plane crashin 1981.   Noriega claims the U.S. charges of drug trafficking and moneylaundering are part of a U.S. plot to abrogate the Panama Canaltreaties of 1977.</TEXT></DOC>
