(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   China's ambassador to the UnitedStates appealed Monday for patience and understanding of turmoil inhis homeland, but warned that China doesn't tolerate pressure orinterference.   ``At present, the important thing is not to interfere in China'sinternal affairs, particularly when it is in difficulty. Do notmake things more difficult,'' Ambassador Han Xu told a packedluncheon meeting of the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches.   Han said the public comments were his first ``since thoseterrible developments occurred in China,'' referring to bloodystudent uprisings in Tiananmen Square seven weeks ago.   He also said they would be his last public comments asambassador. At age 65 and after two decades of active involvementin U.S.-China relations, he said he is retiring and will soon returto Beijing.   Han said he would leave the United States with mixed feelings,but remained confident that the dramatic progress in relationsbetween the two countries would survive the current strain. He saidBeijing has shown restraint in reacting to U.S. sanctions over theChinese government's quelling of the protests.   Chinese officials have said 300 people died during thecrackdown, but witnesses and Western intelligence sources say thenumber was in the thousands. The government has also executeddozens of people who allegedly participated.   ``Where the question of state sovereignty is concerned, Chinaalways stands firm. To put pressure on China is not the way to talkbusiness.   ``It is unwise. It never works, and it can only end up hurtingthe mutual interests of both countries,'' Han said.   ``There is much talk of imposing further economic sanctionsagainst China,'' he added. ``Such sanctions must be firmlyrejected. They hurt the United States as much as they hurt China.The only effect on China that I can think of is that would pushback China into the isolation of the old days. I am sure that it isnot a prospect that you want to see.''   Han, ambassador since 1985, said he didn't expect to make manyconverts to his government's view of the uprisings, which itcharacterizes as the work of a very small traitorous mob.   Han said Americans and others should look at the context of theturmoil. China is undergoing massive economic reforms, trying toovercome backward industry, illiteracy problems, lack of arableland for its 1.1 billion people and new problems of bureaucraticcorruption and speculators. China has made great economic progressin the past decade, he said, and that has led to inflation,increased expectations and economic disparities that also createpolitical turmoil.   Because of the changes it is attempting, the Chinese government``places so much emphasis upon the maintenance of order and unityand ... must respond vigorously to signs of chaos and turmoil,'' hesaid.   Han said the friendship between Americans and Chinese ishistorical and is important to both countries.   ``Let's be guided by the forces of history and reason from thistime forward. An ancient Chinese wise man once said: `Spilt watercannot be gathered up.'''   Han drew 548 people, by far the largest crowd in the ForumClub's 17-year history, said executive director R.J. Kirkpatrick.Florida Atlantic University and the University of Miami and othernearby colleges all have Chinese student contingents, and the clubhired several security guards for possible protests.   ``We have not had even a hint of protest,'' said Kirkpatrick.``Not oral or otherwise.''   Henry Feustel, of the local chapter of the Chinese-AmericanFriendship Association, said displeasure with the Tiananmen Squareviolence shouldn't be allowed to ruin relations.   ``We are all mad, boiling mad,'' he said. ``But you have to lookto the future.''</TEXT></DOC>
