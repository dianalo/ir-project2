BarnesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CBS WNEWS </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   CBS Inc., stuck in third place in the prime-time television ratings, said entertainment division President B. Donald &quot;Bud&quot; Grant resigned.    The company said Mr. Grant, who headed the division since 1980, stepped down to form his own independent production company. In his post, he was responsible for overseeing the development, selection and scheduling of most of the network's programming.    CBS didn't name his successor.    In an interview yesterday, Mr. Grant said his departure was voluntary. Yet rumors that Laurence A. Tisch, chief executive officer of the network, wanted to replace Mr. Grant have been circulating for about a year, and have been particularly intense in recent weeks. Mr Grant said he &quot;really didn't know&quot; of any such move.    Mr. Grant said his contract with CBS includes provisions that require the network to help him establish an independent production company at his option. &quot;I'm about two-thirds of the way through my current employment agreement, and it just seemed the right time&quot; to exercise the option, Mr. Grant said.    CBS said Mr. Grant's new venture will supply programming to the network, and that he will become a consultant to CBS. The company said Mr. Grant's chief lieutenant, Earle H. &quot;Kim&quot; LeMasters, vice president of programs, would report -- for now -- directly to Gene F. Jankowski, president of the CBS Broadcast Group.    Under Mr. Grant, CBS finished first in prime-time for five consecutive seasons. The network, however, fell to second place two seasons ago behind a rejuvenated National Broadcasting Co., and sank to third place this season.    Messrs. Grant and LeMasters were the architects of a bold bid this season to revive CBS's sagging ratings; the network replaced eight of its 22 hours of weekly prime-time programming, the most ever for CBS.    But the new shows have produced mixed results, in part because of successful sports programming aired by rival Capital Cities/ABC. For the first five weeks of the new season, ended Oct. 25, NBC was ranked a strong first, while ABC had a full rating point lead over CBS. Historically, CBS ratings have improved later in the season, after fall sports broadcasts have concluded.    Mr. Grant said his decision to leave the network was &quot;absolutely not&quot; related to its current ratings position.    One source close to CBS predicted network executives &quot;are going to give Kim a chance to see what he can do without Bud&quot; before appointing a successor to Mr. Grant, a 15-year veteran of CBS. &quot;Kim is obviously the leading candidate,&quot; Mr. Grant added.    But the source also said many top candidates reportedly approached for the job declined the position, in part because of the intense daily pressure that accompanies the post.    &quot;There are no superstars around who want the job,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a lot of 'B'-level people around, but 'A'-level people aren't interested.&quot; He declined to identify the candidates. </TEXT></DOC>
