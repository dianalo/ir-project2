Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, saidIsrael backed the call for wiping out stockpiles but declined tocomment on the possibility of doing so within 10 years as Bushproposed.   ``Israel supports very much the banning of all chemicalweapons,'' he said.   ``We have warned many times that Arab countries are armingthemselves with such weapons and have in some cases used themagainst civilian populations.''   Pazner noted Iraq and Iran used chemical weapons during the8-year Persian Gulf conflict and reports also surfaced of Syria andLibya manufacturing them.   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said, ``Israel's position is that we are totally againststocking or using chemical weapons and any action that leads to thesuppression of chemical arms is welcomed and supported by Israel.   ``We hope that there will be a worldwide movement so that allthese weapons will be destroyed and never put to use again.''   Bush proposed Monday that America would eliminate all of itschemical arms within 10 years if the Soviet Union and othercountries do the same.   Israeli military analyst Aharon Levran, a retired army brigadiergeneral, said Arab countries probably would balk at giving upchemical weapons that they saw as a counter to Israel's reportednuclear capability.   He also suggested Arab countries may attach politicalconditions, such as Israeli withdrawal from lands captured in warwith Arab states.   Israel has never confirmed it, but foreign reports say Israelhas nuclear and chemical weapons as well as long-range missilescapable of delivering them.   Israel is considering nationwide deployment of protective masksto counter the eventuality of chemical weapons. Civil defenseauthorities are conducting a yearlong trial in which 3,000residents of two towns were given such masks.   Israeli soldiers have been equipped with modern, protectivemasks and suits as well as detection and decontamination equipment.   Iraq is known to have chemical weapons, including mustard gasand the nerve agent Sarin. It used mustard gas against enemysoldiers while fighting Iran, and against civilians in Kurdistan,according to an assessment by Levran and members of an Israeliresearch group.   Syria has extensive stockpiles of chemical weapons, includingthe nerve gas Sarin, the report said. Libya also is believed tohave poison gas. Egypt also has stockpiles of poison gas, accordingto the report by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in TelAviv.   Levran said he doubted Iraq would heed Bush's call.   ``The Iraqis are afraid that one day the Iranians will amass theforces and overrun them,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
