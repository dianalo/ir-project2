Rain -- lots of it, and soon -- is what is needed to snap the commodity price spiral and halt further crop damage, traders, analysts and farmers agree. They and most weather forecasters also concur that substantial amounts of rain aren't going to fall on the Farm Belt for at least the next week or two.    Corn, soybean, wheat and oat futures prices all shot up their daily permissible limits and closed there on the Chicago Board of Trade. The daily limits will be expanded 150% today, allowing soybean futures contracts to rise or fall 45 cents, for example, compared with 30 cents yesterday.    The drought also held sway over the cattle futures markets as live cattle futures contracts for delivery next year rose sharply in price. Ranchers, unable to support large herds on their drought-plagued pastures, are sending so many cattle to market this year that shortages are expected in 1989, as are higher consumer prices at the meat counter.    The price increases in commodity futures were felt far beyond Chicago's trading pits. The sharp rise in grain and soybean futures prices fueled a 5.34-point jump in the widely followed Commodity Research Bureau futures index to 270.52. The increase in the CRB index -- which is viewed as an inflation barometer by many traders in the financial markets -- revived fears of higher interest rates and helped depress prices in the stock and bond markets.    Soybean futures for September delivery closed up 30 cents at $10.41 a bushel; September corn futures gained 10 cents to close at $3.575 a bushel; wheat futures for September delivery added 20 cents to close at $4.0875 a bushel and September oat futures closed up 15 cents at $3.79 a bushel.    With most grain and soybean futures contracts &quot;locked limit up&quot; from the opening bell, most buyers and sellers were forced to sit on their hands and wait in vain for the markets to move. Many exchange floor traders are betting on higher prices to come and loading up on contracts with every temporary dip in price, traders said. And as evidenced by the limit price moves yesterday, few traders or commercial users of futures are willing to part with their contracts at current levels.    An exception to the general rule is Mint Investment Management Co., New York, which during the past few weeks sold almost all the grain and soybean futures contracts it had held for customers, said Michael Delman, a Mint partner. Mr. Delman said that Mint had about 10% of its $400 million in assets at risk in these markets earlier this spring.    But he said that with the steep price increases of recent weeks and heightened volatility in the markets, &quot;the risks inherent in the positions were out of proportion to the potential rewards.    &quot;We don't project highs in markets. The amount of upside we forgo isn't important,&quot; he said. Mr. Delman said that Mint's profits from its grain and soybean positions totaled between $30 million and $40 million.    Analysts had expected that the cool air mass over the Midwest would spark widespread rainfall. Instead, &quot;we made the transition from extraordinarily hot to cool without a drop of rain,&quot; said Dale Gustafson, a futures analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.    The weather outlook isn't likely to damp drought fears. &quot;We're predicting below-normal rainfall and above-normal temperatures for the next six to 10 days,&quot; said John Wright, a meteorologist with the Midwest Agricultural Weather Service Center at Purdue University.    He said that by week's end temperatures could return to the upper 90s to lower 100s in portions of Iowa and Illinois.    A weak storm over west Texas could bring some rain to the western fringe of the Corn Belt tonight or tomorrow. But the scattered showers aren't likely to produce more than a quarter inch to three quarters of an inch of rain, said Harvey Freese, a principal of Freese-Notis Weather in Des Moines, Iowa.    &quot;This is a weather scare rally. It will take a dramatic change in the weather situation to turn this market around,&quot; said Mario Balletto, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
