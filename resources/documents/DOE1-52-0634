<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-52-0634 </DOCNO><TEXT>In July and August 1986, a 2700 gallon KPEG (chemical reagents preparedfrom polyethylene glycols and potassium hydroxide) was used in Butte,Montana on a wood preserving site and in Kent, Washington on a wastedisposal site to successfully destroy PCDDs and PCDFs (120 ppb - 200ppm) in 17,000 gallons of liquid waste to non-detectable levels. A prototypereactor designed to treat both liquids and solids will be tested in 1987on selected Superfund and Department of Defense sites. These field studieswill validate or establish conditions in the prototype reactor for destructionof PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs to acceptable levels required by the regulations.This presentation will review treatment data, regulations for treatedmaterials, costs, and the potentials of KPEG process for the destructionof a variety of halogenated pollutants.</TEXT></DOC>
