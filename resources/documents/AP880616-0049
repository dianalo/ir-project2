Behind him strode six GuardianAngels, making sure he kept on ambling, through Restaurant Row andout of the neighborhood off Broadway.   ``He's not going to sell (drugs) with us around,'' Travis``Ace'' Stephens, head of the Angels' operation, said Wednesdaynight as he watched the parade.   The Angels were recruited last week by a group of 15restaurateurs who claimed increased drug dealing on the street hadcut their business by as much as 20 percent.   The resulting publicity, however, also may be hurting business,said Frank Medlin, manager of Carolina, one of the participatingrestaurants, though he thinks the Angels ``are doing a wonderfuljob.''   ``We have alerted everyone that West 46th Street is combatalley,'' he said. ``We may have a safer block _ with no one on it.''   Despite debates over whether the patrols are good or bad,whether the Angels are violating people's rights _ and despiteattacks on two Angels on Saturday that resulted in thehospitalization of a 16-year-old Angel _ the Angels will continue``slammin' and jammin','' leader Curtis Sliwa said.   That means holding suspected drug dealers up against a wall,under citizen's arrest, until police arrive. Those carrying just alittle crack may get off with crushed vials and a shove.   ``It's not a block watch or a crime watch, it's physicalintervention,'' Sliwa said. ``It's action.''   The Angels on Wednesday expanded their patrols into the Broadwaytheater district and neighboring Hell's Kitchen, a neighborhoodplagued by a drug problem, he said.   The Angels began their watch June 7 in return for a headquartersin the closed Cafe de France and meals from restaurants on theblock between Eighth and Ninth avenues.   Sliwa recalled that he laughed when first approached aboutpatrolling Restaurant Row, a pleasant block of brownstones linedwith more than 20 restaurants near the theater district. Still, heagreed to stop by.   ``We're walking down the street,'' Sliwa said, ``and dudes werecracking it up all over the place.''   To get there from the theaters and hotels around Times Square,patrons must cross Eighth Avenue, a noisy, tawdry thoroughfarelined with porno palaces.   Bringing in the Angels while complaining about a lack of policeprotection naturally led to tension between the civilian patrol andthe Police Department.   Two Angels were arrested Sunday and charged with menacing andharassing a man on the sidewalk. ``Even the police have no right totell someone to get off the block,'' said Assistant Chief ThomasWalsh.   Police officials told Sliwa on Sunday night that the Angels mustrefrain from harassing people they suspect of drug dealing. Theycould make a citizen's arrest only if they witnessed a crime.   Wednesday afternoon, Angels grabbed a man they said had beenselling crack, called police and held him until officers arrivedand arrested him on a charge of criminal possession of a controlledsubstance. It was the first such arrest since Sunday.   ``They do good, but they can be a hazard,'' said Joseph Dirdis,45, as he sat on the steps outside his 46th Street apartmentbuilding. ``They move as a group, and they react very fast _ theyhave to take it easy. They make me a little uncomfortable.''   But Wednesday night, many passers-by greeted the Angels withencouragement: ``Keep up the good work'' and ``We're proud of youguys.''   ``These guys aren't hurting people who are minding their ownbusiness,'' said Ralph Bilby, who lives on West 47th Street andstopped by the Angels' headquarters to offer support. ``It doesn'tfeel dangerous anymore.''   Mayor Edward I. Koch, asked about the expanding patrols, said,``There's nothing wrong with that. We can encourage responsiblecitizen involvement.''   The Angels use ``methods used by the cop on the beat yearsago,'' Sliwa said, before complaints by civil libertarians limitedtheir options.   ``We say, just because you've put manacles on your own cops,don't take away our rights as citizens to make arrests,'' he said.``Because of the cops' inability to intervene, we have picked upthe slack.''   Sliwa added, ``We haven't changed our tactics _ it's just thatwe're in the eye of the storm now.''</TEXT></DOC>
