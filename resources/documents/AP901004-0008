ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As Carl Gillis sees it, President Bush has aproblem with hard-line anti-tax people in rural Georgia. ``He donetold us one time he wasn't going to tax. I think in the backside oftheir minds there may be a little backlash.''   Not that Gillis is against the president. He's a RepublicanNational committeeman from Georgia.   But the people he's talking to, ``the vocal ones,'' are stronglyopposed to the budget compromise Bush is trying to sell to thecountry and Congress.   In Massachusetts, where a full-blown tax revolt is under way,the compromise also gets a negative reception, according toRepublican Party chairman Ray Shamie.   ``People don't blame the president,'' said Shamie. ``They blameCongress.''   As the House moved toward a vote on the outlines of the packageof tax increases and spending cuts, there was a strong sense ofbipartisan political nervousness around the country.   Clearly the most nervous are those in tough political races.   ``If you're a marginal member (of Congress), this is adisaster,'' said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. She describedthe electorate as a ``very, very crabby and unhappy set ofvoters.''   She said Democrats are ``in a very hard place and conservativeRepublicans are making it harder for Democrats.''   Conservatives like House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia werequick to break with the Republican president on the budgetcompromises. Equally swift in putting distance between themselvesand the package were GOP candidates.   Reps. Tom Tauke of Iowa, Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island,Lynn Martin of Illinois, and Bill Schuette of Michigan were amongthe first to declare their opposition to the package.   All are Republicans, all are challenging Democratic senators andare behind in the polls but remain within striking distance.   Rep. Pat Saiki, R-Hawaii, was the only GOP Senate challenger inthe House who was not flatly opposed to the compromise. She alsowas the only one leading her Democratic opponent, Sen. DanielAkaka, in the polls.   ``I think most Republicans recognize we're in a very difficultposition,'' said Richard Schwarm, chairman of the Iowa RepublicanParty. ``Republicans are truly divided over whether this is thebest deal possible. How it falls out politically, I have no way ofknowing.''   In Iowa, and in neighboring South Dakota and Nebraska, similarcomplaints were heard about the proposed increase in the gasolinetax and the higher premiums for Medicare as well as cuts in farmprograms.   But there also was a sense that the country needed to standbehind the president in a difficult time.   ``My feeling is we have to do something,'' said Norm Riffel, theNebraska GOP chairman. ``We have to share in taking care of thisdeficit.''   But candidates were less inclined to be supportive than partyofficials.   Former congressman Hal Daub, challenging Nebraska DemocraticSen. James Exon, said he was skeptical of the figures included inthe compromise.   ``They're very false numbers,'' he said. ``They're notreal-world numbers. They have painted far too rosy a scenario.''   Alabama Republican Bill Cabaniss, challenging Sen. HowellHeflin, said the plan was ``almost guaranteed to drive our economyinto a recession.''   The budget compromise often provided an area of agreementbetween opposing candidates.   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, joined with Tauke in opposition to theplan, as did the Republican and Democratic candidates battling tosucceed Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., who is retiring.   The accord is ``anti-growth, anti-jobs,'' said Republican JimRamstad.   ``Another example of politics as usual,'' said Democrat LouDeMars.   ``The people I'm talking to in the real world ... don't want taxincreases,'' said Ramstad. ``They are particularly angry with thegas tax increase.''   Lake said higher gasoline taxes were ``a key element'' in apublic sense that the economy is rapidly going downhill.   In a televised appeal for support for the compromise, Bush urgedAmericans Tuesday night to call members of Congress.   The joke, however, said Rep. Pete Geren, D-Texas, is ``they'reall calling their congressmen a whole lot more than yesterday, butthey're all calling to say vote against it.''   The staff member who answered the telephone in the Washingtonoffice of Gingrich laughed when asked if the office was getting alot of calls.   Gingrich, the No. 2 Republican in the House, was on the budgetnegotiating team but opposed the agreement and refused toparticipate with the president in announcing the settlement.   ``At 10 o'clock this morning in our Morrow, Ga., office we had143 calls against it and 20 for it. And we'd only been open sincenine,'' said the Gingrich aide. She said the Washington office hadreceived 91 calls against the budget and 22 for it by the sametime.</TEXT></DOC>
