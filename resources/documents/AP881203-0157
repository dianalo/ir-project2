Moreover, the hostility and controversy aroused by the conduct ofchief executive F. Ross Johnson in his dogged pursuit of RJR Nabiscoreflects heightened concerns about potential conflicts of interestwhen managers try to buy their companies.   Some even say the fallout from this deal could dampen theenthusiasm for future management-led takeovers.   Particularly troubling to many management strategists, and to thecompany's directors as well, were Johnson's initial buy-lowapproach, his extravagant built-in rewards in the takeover plan andhis evident disregard for the fate of most of the cigarette and foodgiant's 120,000 employees.   Despite the Johnson group's final $112-a-share, $25.2 billionoffer, RJR directors chose the $109-a-share, $24.5 billionalternative from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the unchallengedleader in debt-financed takeovers.   Kohlberg's victory marked the biggest takeover in history andcapped a tumultuous struggle for the nation's 19th largestindustrial company, which transfixed the financial world, incitedcongressional scrutiny and intensified concerns about the growingpiles of debt burdening the American economy through the growingpopularity of so-called leveraged buyouts.   Although many lessons will be learned from this classic WallStreet brawl, the ones that will most likely grab the attention ofmanagers contemplating their own leveraged buyouts are Johnson'smistakes.   ``I think one lesson they can draw is not to think they have alock on the deal because they are the experienced managers and thatthey know the business,'' said Stewart Veale, finance divisionmanager of the American Management Association, a leading trainingand education group in New York.   ``Another thing is, this very well may be a signal that boards ofdirectors believe managements have to pay closer attention toemployees,'' Veale said.   Post-mortem accounts of the Kohlberg-Johnson struggle show RJRdirectors were impressed with the buyout firm's commitment tominimize disruption to the company, while Johnson was determined tosell everything except the tobacco business to pay off the giantdebt he would assume in the deal.   The board also appreciated Kohlberg's sensitivty to RJR workers,while Johnson's offer barely mentioned them.   ``Ordinarily, boards in the past have taken the position thatthey'll accept the offer with the best return to shareholders,''Veale said. ``This is the first one of significant size where theydidn't reach that determination.''   To be sure, at least some shareholders will be angry over what onits face value is a lower purchase price for their stock.Predictions already are flying that RJR directors will face numerouslawsuits over their disregard of the so-called business judgmentrule, by accepting the cheaper of two offers.   But some management and takeover experts say that anger ismisguided, since Johnson's group started with a bid of $75 pershare. Where, they ask, was Johnson's obligation to maximize valueto the shareholders when he offered that price?   ``I think the real villain in this whole process was Mr.Johnson,'' said Yakov Amihud, a finance professor at New YorkUniversity's Stern School of Business, who has just written a bookabout management-led takeovers.   ``He was the insider with the information. Kohlberg was theoutsider without the information. The knight that saved thestockholders was Kohlberg, because if they didn't get into it,Johnson would have walked away with it for $75,'' Amihud said.``Stockholders should be thankful to Kohlberg.''   Steven P. Galante, managing director of Buyout Publications,which tracks trends in debt-financed takeovers, said he believed theRJR saga will help ``force management to recognize that aresponsible board isn't going to let management get away with a lowbid. Management shouldn't low-ball it.''   At the same time, Galante, said, the RJR takeover also providedsome useful lessons to directors. The objective bidding process thatcollapsed into a free-for-all auction with extended deadlines andlast-minute haggling was something that other boards will likelyavoid, he said.   ``I think the board in this case was trying to strike a strongdegree of independence, and show it was going to put the company upto the highest bidder,'' Galante said. ``It turned out to be afiasco. It created all this bidding with a lot of uncertainty aboutwhether the deals could be financed.''   Ultimately, it may have been Kohlberg's supremacy in financingother takeovers that led RJR's directors to believe going with theinvestment firm's offer was more responsible.   ``If you were on a buyout team, would you rather be on Kohlberg'sside or the other side?,'' said Carla Hayn, amergers-and-acquisitions professor at Northwestern University'sKellogg business school. ``Kohlberg has a lot more familiarity andthe financial resources to at least ride out any downturn. Wheredoes Johnson go for money?''   Even though Johnson presumably knew his business better than anoutsider, Ms. Hayn said, ``It's cheaper to buy a new CEO than toarrange financing. If I had to cast my stakes, even if Kohlberg didoffer the lower price, I'd be going with someone that has gonethrough these kind of transactions before.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
