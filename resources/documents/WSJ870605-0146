Lenders last week were asking, on average, a 10.7% interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate conventional mortgages, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That was down from 10.81% a week earlier but above the 10.38% rate of a year ago. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    At the same time, lenders were asking an average rate of 8.01% for the first year of 30-year conventional mortgages with adjustable rates indexed to one-year Treasury bills. The rate was up from 7.99% a week earlier.    &quot;There's no question that the percentage of adjustables is going to rise,&quot; said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. &quot;What we've been hearing from mortgage bankers is there's just a lot more interest&quot; in the floating-rate loans.    Frank Nothaft, senior economist at Freddie Mac, said that during the past two months, the difference in the rates between adjustables and fixed-rate loans has been &quot;dramatic.&quot; He noted that &quot;it's the widest spread in the last three years,&quot; adding that in some months, the cost of fixed-rate loans encouraged as many as 60% of borrowers to opt for adjustable-rate loans.    A separate survey by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board showed a slight increase in the percentage of adjustable-rate loans closed. Adjustables accounted for 25% of all loans closed in early May compared with 22% a month earlier.    According to the Bank Board survey, which is taken the first five business days of the month, the average effective interest rates for fixed-rate mortgages in early May rose to 10.52%, up almost one percentage point from the 9.70% rate in April. The figures apply to single-family home mortgages maturing in 25 years or more.    The Bank Board said lenders in early May were seeking an 8.49% average effective interest rate for the most popular adjustable-rate loans, those that restrict rate increases. That rate was slightly above the 8.36% rate of early April. Similarly, for loans without rate caps, lenders were asking 8.25% early last month, up from 8% in early April.    The Bank Board also reported that the average price for a new home fell to $133,700 in early May from $136,900 a month earlier. The average term for all conventional loans closed in early May was 26 years, a slight drop from the 26.5 of the previous month. Loans in early May were for an average of 74.9% of the purchase price compared with 74.8% the month before, and 73.4% a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
