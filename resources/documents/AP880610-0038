About 5,000 students, yelling ``Skin the Yankees'' and ``Uniteour fatherland,'' tried to march out of Yonsei University to headfor the border to press for the peninsula's reunification.   Waves of students hurling firebombs charged out of theuniversity's main gate to attack waiting riot police. Severalofficers hit by firebombs screamed when they were covered inblazing gasoline.   Other students pelted police with rocks and broken bricks aslines of riot troopers battled to drive them back into the school.   Later, about 2,000 students massed on a 500-yard section ofstreet leading to Seoul's main railway station and tried to marchto the station, shouting, ``Let's go and meet brothers from theNorth.''   Police drove them back with tear gas, but the students regroupedand clashed anew with police. Then groups of hundreds of studentslay on their backs in the street with arms linked. Others fled intoside streets. Police took away at least 100 students.   At Korea University, about 3,000 students battled police withrocks and firebombs, and police countered with tear gas, the Koreannews agency Yonhap reported.   Several hundred students also rallied to back the northwardmarch plan at two other campuses in Seoul and one in thesoutheastern port of Pusan, Yonhap said, but there were noimmediate reports of violence in those rallies.   At Yonsei, black police armored vans with multiple tear gaslaunchers fired thunderous barrages of the gas bombs into chargingstudents. Dense white clouds of the choking mist enveloped thecampus, but students kept on attacking.   ``Drive out the Yankees who divide our fatherland,'' radicalleaders bellowed over loudspeakers as they urged the students toattack again and again. ``Down with the military dictatorship,''students shouted.   Thousands of riot police had surrounded the sprawling campusafter the government banned the unification march as a threat tonational security. Vicious fighting erupted at the school Thursdaywhen students clashed with riot police trying to prevent them fromassembling.   About 6,000 students kept an overnight vigil at the school toprepare for the march.   The students, joined by some dissident leaders, staged a rallybefore marching Friday, but it appeared that their numbers hadfallen considerably from Thursday.   Some of the 13 delegates chosen by the students forreunification talks with North Korean counterparts attended therally, and rally organizers announced that two of their 13 alreadywere trying to make their way to the border truce site of Panmunjom.   North Korean official media monitored in Tokyo have reportedthat the North's representatives already have gone to the borderarea.   The government deployed 60,000 riot police and put securityforces on maximum alert to stop the march. Riot squads guarded keylocations throughout Seoul and roads leading to the border, 30miles to the north.   Yonhap reported that about 400 wounded and disabled militaryveterans staged a demonstration on the south bank of the ImjinRiver to denounce the students' march plan. The river, about sevenmiles south of the North-South boundary, is the farthest northSouth Korea allows civilians to go without a special pass.   Scores of policemen and students were injured Thursday. Officerswith burns or blood pouring from cuts were dragged away by comradesor slumped exhausted against walls. Student leaders said at leastfive protesters were hurt seriously.   Students took two captured officers away with their hands tiedand their fate was not known. Police made scores of arrests.   Running clashes were reported Thursday in at least eightprovincial cities between police and students trying to reach thecapital for the march. More than 200 students were arrested inKwangju and street fights also took place in Suwon, Taeju, Taejon,Mockpo, Chung, Iri and Kyongju.   The protests were bitterly anti-American. Radical leaders blamethe United States for the peninsula's division in 1945, and severalviolent anti-American protests have occurred in the past month.   Radical students are a small but powerful minority on universitycampuses and get no support from the most South Koreans who believeNorth Korea wants to conquer the South. An invasion by the North in1950 started the Korean war.   Today is the first anniversary of the start of riots that forcedthe government to agree to elections and reforms.   During the Yonsei rally, radical leaders accused the UnitedStates of ruling the South as a colony. They demanded immediatereunification and expulsion of the 42,000 American soldiersstaioned in South Korea.   No intergovernment unification talks are in progress and thelast contacts were in 1985. North Korea refused talks in 1986because of U.S.-South Korean military exercises it said were apreparation for war, and each side has rejected recent proposalsmade by the other.   Riot police guarded government buildings enclosed the U.S.Embassy in a protective ring. The U.S. Army television stationcautioned Americans about trouble spots.</TEXT></DOC>
