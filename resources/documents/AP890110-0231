It found that religious bodies lead the field in charitable workfor others, surpassing foundations and corporations.

The study found that almost half of the $41.4 billion contributedin 1986 to religion was used to support services to others. The restwas spent on internal activities such as worship and religiouseducation.   Pollster George Gallup, whose organization gathered the data,said it showed churches are ``among our most cost-effectiveinstitutions'' in philantropic work, with minimal administrativeoverhead.</TEXT><DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn.
