A general strike shut stores, offices and schools in theterritories for the second day, and at least 26 Palestinians werereported wounded in clashes with Israeli troops.   The government announced that charges had been filed against anIsraeli man for a traffic accident blamed for sparking thePalestinian uprising 20 months ago that has claimed 669 Palestinianand Israeli lives.   The strike call was made in slogans painted on walls in the GazaStrip and signed by the underground leadership of the uprising.   The 50,000 Gaza Palestinians who hold jobs in Israel were told tobegin a two-week strike Friday, the day Israel begins enforcing alaw that requires Gaza residents to have computerized ID cards toenter Israel.   On Tuesday, underground leaders of the uprising ordered the60,000 West Bank Palestinians to begin a weeklong boycott of theirjobs in Israel to protest the cards.   The protest could cost many Palestinians their jobs. Israeliemployers have been under pressure from the government to replacetheir Arab workers with Israelis for security reasons and to lowerthe nation's rising unemployment rate.   But leaflets ordering the strikes said Palestinians defying thecall would be considered ``betrayers.''   Israel said Gaza Palestinians who do not have the newmagnetic-strip cards will be turned back at the crossing into Israelstarting Friday.   However, Brig. Gen. Arye Ramot, head of the military governmentin Gaza, said later Wednesday that some cards likely will be issuedafter the Friday deadline.   Israel television report said 55,000 cards have been issued andestimated that 1,000 have been destroyed by Palestinian activists.   The government began issuing the computerized cards two monthsago to control the movement of Gaza residents. Cards are deniedanyone with a criminal record or considered a security risk.   Palestinian activists have urged Gazans not to accept the cardsand have entered towns and refugee camps to collect and destroy manycards already issued.   Arab reporters said confrontations between soldiers andPalestinians on Wednesday were the most violent in recent weeks, butthey gave no explanation for the upsurge.   In the Askar refugee camp in the West Bank, soldiers opened fireto disperse masked youths marching with Palestinian flags, thereporters said.   In the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, youths barricadedstreets with rocks, burned tires and hurled stones at soldiers, Arabreporters said.   Hospital officials said said eight Palestinians were wounded inAskar, seven in Jabaliya, and 11 elsewhere. The army confirmed fivePalestinians were wounded in the Nablus area and said it waschecking the other reports.   At least 536 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops andJewish settlers since the uprising against Israeli rule in the WestBank and Gaza Strip began in December 1987. Another 95 Palestinianshave been killed by other Palestinians who accused them ofcollaborating with Israeli officials.   Thirty-eight Israelis have died in the violence.   Herzl Bokovza, 29 was charged Tuesday with reckless driving andmanslaughter in the deaths of four Gaza Arabs in the incident thatstarted the rebellion.   Witnesses said Bokovza's truck collided Dec. 8, 1987, with a carcarrying four Gaza laborers. The four Arabs were killed.   Rumors spread that the driver had intentionally run over theworkers to avenge the earlier stabbing death of a Jewish man, andrioting broke out.   On Dec. 9, thousands of Palestinians took to the streets, burningtires and throwing stones at soldiers, as they have ever since.   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Etty Eshed said the filing ofcharges was delayed by a long police investigation and crowded courtcalendars.</TEXT></DOC>
