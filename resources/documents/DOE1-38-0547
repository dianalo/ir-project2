They also discuss techniquesfor the reduction by differentiation of higher index problems to lowerindex ones that can be solved numerically without introducing additionalconstants of integration. Furthermore, they give transformations betweengeneral DAEs and ones in semi-explicit form, and, by these techniques,show how a problem can be reduced to an index 1, semi-explicit form thatcan be reduced to an implicit differential equation from whose solutionto the original problem can be retrieved by at most a differentiationand a linear transformation.</TEXT></DOC>
