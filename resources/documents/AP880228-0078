Bob Dole charged on Sunday that VicePresident George Bush condoned trading arms for hostages in theIran-Contra affair, saying in a Republican presidential debate,``We shouldn't do those things.''   In a key confrontation before the March 8 Super Tuesdayprimaries across the South, Rep. Jack Kemp slammed Bush and Dole _the party's front-runners _ as two moderates who would raise taxesand end the Reagan revolution.   ``They sound alike. They talk alike. They've supported everysingle tax increase over the last eight years,'' Kemp said. ``Ifthey're nominated, the Reagan revolution is over, gone, dead.''   Bush and Dole objected, saying they have fought against taxincreases and for the Reagan administration's agenda for the pastseven years.   They fired back at Kemp for what they contend is his casualattitude toward the federal budget deficit.   ``Jack's never met a deficit he didn't like,'' Dole said.   Bush told the New York congressman, `You don't care aboutdeficits. You never have, and they're public enemy No. 1.''   On the recent turmoil in Panama, both Dole and Kemp warned thatthe United States will not tolerate instability near the PanamaCanal.   ``If we've learned anything from Iran-Contra, we ought to give(military strongman Manuel Antonio) Noriega 30 days to get out ofPanama or tell him we're going to have a trade embargo,'' Dolesaid, adding the United States should ``de-recognize'' Noriega'sregime.   Kemp said, ``If the Panamanians want to keep Noregia, the UnitedStates of America is going to keep the Panama Canal.''   It was the first debate with all four hopefuls since the NewHampshire primary and it may be the last one for Bush.   Campaign manager Lee Atwater told reporters that Bush is notscheduled to do any more debates, including the League of WomenVoters confrontation next Sunday in Nashville, Tenn. Dole campaignmanager Bill Brock said Bush is following a ``front-runner'sstrategy'' by skipping the debate.   Bush tried at one point in the debate to say Republicans shouldnot be criticizing each other, but that didn't stop Dole fromattacking the vice president for the Reagan administration'sdecision to trade arms for hostages in the Iran-Contra affair.   ``We never should trade arms for hostages. We shouldn't issuethese reports and say we shouldn't trade arms for hostages _ thevice president's report _ and then later go to a meeting and sayit's all right. We shouldn't do those things,'' Dole said, holdingup a report on terrorism that was written by a commission headed byBush.   Bush did not respond directly, but did say ``mistakes weremade'' in the Iran-Contra affair. Asked later if the affair hadoccurred on ``his watch,'' Bush replied: ``I think when thepresident found out what happened, he took the proper steps.''   Bush has maintained throughout the affair that he did not knowthe arrangement was an arms-for-hostage deal.   Measures to protect the South's textile industry also causedsparks, with Kemp accusing Dole and Pat Robertson of changing theirstands to please Southern voters. More than one-third of theRepublican nominating delegates are at stake in contests across theSouth and elsewhere on March 8.   ``Pat Robertson and Bob Dole sound like Dick Gephardt to me ontrade, and George Bush and Bob Dole say the budget deficit ispublic enemy No. 1. I want to say I belive the Soviet Union ispublic enemy No. 1,'' Kemp said after the debate.   Democratic Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri is the sponsor of atough trade measure that would require U.S. retaliation againstunfair practices by other countries.   Kemp claimed that Robertson and Dole had said in Iowa, ``We'llraise exports of food and grain _ and then go to South Carolina andsay we're going to put up barriers to imports.''   Robertson retorted that he didn't want American jobs being lostto workers in China with its Communist regime.   There were also sharp exchanges on the question of how to reducethe federal deficit, although each denied that they would raisetaxes as president.   ``The problem is not revenues. It's spending,'' Kemp said. ``Wehave a deficit because we have a Congress who spends too muchmoney...and interest rates are too high.''   Bush, outlining his ideas, said: ``I've proposed a four-yearfreeze that allows for inflation....that gives the presidentflexibility.''   Dole defended his own voting record, displaying a multi-pagelist of what he said were his votes against tax increases since1975. He complained that some campaign ads distort his record ontaxes _ a reference to Bush ads _ and then hit at Bush directly.   ``I've been leading the efforts to reduce tax rates,'' Dolesaid. ``You don't go the Bush route. It's a four-yearcop-out...We've got to reduce the deficit ... No one in this groupis advocating raising taxes.''   Later, Bush fired back at Dole, saying the Kansas Republican'splan for a one-year spending freeze would hurt defense.   ``It will cut into the muscle on defense,'' Bush told Dole.   And he defended his own four-year idea: ``I wouldn't call it acop-out. It disciplines the spending side.''   Robertson said the problem is not one of economics.   ``It's a question of will,'' he said, asking if Congress canmake hard decision to cut spending.   Robertson, who has spent much of the past two weeks explainingvarious statements on missiles in Cuba, hostages in Lebanon and thesource of the expose of problems afflicting fellow TV evangelistJimmy Swaggart, said the press is a big problem for candidates.   ``I know it's very difficult dealing with the press of Americato get the truth out. They love to distort our words,'' Robertsonsaid. ``We are making it so difficult in our society for anyone toserve.''   The debate was sponsored by the Atlanta Journal-Constitutionnewspapers, moderated by the papers' Washington correspondent JohnMashek and televised live on the Cable News Network. The Democratstook part in a similar debate on Saturday.   The newspapers sponsored a similar forum Saturday night for thesix Democratic presidential candidates.</TEXT></DOC>
