Cost effectiveness in researchand design has become one of the major engineering criteria and recognitionof this fact influenced the policy of selecting papers for this publication.The majority of the papers stress the problem of modelling events ofinterest in crack tip mechanics, while some of them present the resultsof research conducted along lines traditional in general engineeringto provide a representative picture of the field.</TEXT></DOC>
