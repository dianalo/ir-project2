A year earlier, the New Haven, Conn.-based company earned $34.8 million, or $1.15 a share.    The telecommunications company offered an early retirement package to about 4,300 managers in September. Among other things, it offered to add five years onto their tenure with the company in determining benefits for those retiring before next Friday. It also offered to add five years to the effective age of managers who were too young to qualify for the normal minimum age for retirement benefits. </TEXT></DOC>
