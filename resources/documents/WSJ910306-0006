Without a doubt.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   So guess what: Mr. Amos is returning to work in Kuwaitnext week. &quot;I'm itching to get back,&quot; he says.   Why in the world would he do that?   &quot;I hear that question every day,&quot; says the wiry60-year-old.   The reasons are complex, but they're shared by aremarkable number of the hundreds of former U.S. hostages whowere working in the Persian Gulf, mostly in the oil industry,when fighting broke out. Companies say an overwhelmingmajority of their workers who were held hostage in Kuwait orIraq, or who were trapped for months and couldn't get out,are eager to return.   These men tend to be modern-day cowboys, independent andlaconic Gary Coopers. Ask them why they'd return to such adangerous area and they're likely to spit in the sand, pause,shrug and say, well, &quot;working overseas is what I do,&quot; in thewords of former hostage Dennis Holstin.   But there are other reasons to take the risk -- from prideto money to the stark reality that there aren't a lot of jobsfor men like them in the U.S. And there's evidence of atleast a tiny need to get back on the horse that threw them.&quot;These guys have a John Wayne mentality,&quot; says WilliamChiles, president of a Houston offshore drilling company.&quot;They think they're invincible.&quot; To prove it, they have to goback.   The men also say they don't want to miss theonce-in-a-lifetime challenge of rebuilding the Kuwaiti oilbusiness from the ground up. &quot;We're starting from scratch,&quot;Mr. Amos says, with as much excitement as thisleathery-faced, reserved Texan ever shows.   For the past two weeks, Mr. Amos has been supervising workhere in Houston on retrofitting a $13 million, 16-story-highdrilling rig that will be shipped to Kuwait in about a month.The Iraqis took all the rigs belonging to his employer, SantaFe Drilling Co., a unit of Kuwait Petroleum Corp. They alsodismantled or destroyed campsites, buildings and apparentlyevery piece of oil-field equipment.   Mr. Amos and others who are returning are also attractedby the thing that got them there in the first place. Foroil-field men, going to the Middle East is like playing inthe major leagues. A typical well in Kuwait spews 8,000barrels a day of crude compared with an average of 12 inTexas.   For some, it's a chance to see the world and mix with themost cosmopolitan crowd they'll ever know. A drilling rig inthe Middle East is like a United Nations meeting. A campsitefor 50 could include men from Jordan, Syria, the Philippines,Egypt, Kuwait, India, the U.S., Canada and Britain. One thingbinds them: They are all oil men, and proud of it. &quot;We're adifferent breed,&quot; Mr. Amos says.   Mr. Holstin, the ex-hostage, who is also employed by SantaFe, wants to return as quickly as possible to the &quot;gypsy&quot;life he knows. Friends call him &quot;the Kuwaiti cowboy&quot; becauseof his penchant for boots, oversize belt buckles and otherWestern wear. &quot;It's a way of life that you get used to,&quot; hesays. &quot;The idea of working five days in an office is awfulmundane.&quot;   His wife, Bev, a bartender near their home in Eureka,Calif., believes Kuwait will be a safer place now that theIraqis have been so soundly defeated. But she still fearsthat her husband will be killed by a land mine in the desert.She and other family members are begging him to stay home --so far without success.   Other workers are returning for the simple reason thatthey haven't found work in the States. &quot;I haven't had apaycheck since July,&quot; says Robert Clayton, a drilling expert,whose calculations show his life's savings running out by theend of this month. He hasn't landed a job in Kuwait yet, buthe's prepared to go. &quot;Three days, I could be ready,&quot; he says.&quot;Two if necessary.&quot;   Mr. Clayton worked for the OGE Drilling Inc. unit ofO'Brien Goins Simpson Inc. when he was trapped in Kuwaitafter the Aug. 2 invasion. He avoided captivity bymasquerading as an Argentine. But he wasn't allowed to leave.Some employers kept issuing paychecks to families, but hiscompany didn't, fearing the expense would bankrupt the smallfirm.   &quot;Never forget that people who work overseas do make moremoney,&quot; says Bill Schaub, who recruits the OGE staff forKuwait. A rig supervisor earns $55,000 to $85,000 a year inthe Middle East, Mr. Schaub says, double what some can net inthe U.S., including the fact that the first $70,000 of incomeisn't taxed if the worker spends most of the year abroad.   That's not all. In Kuwait, housing was free. So were thetelephone, water and other utilities. A car came with thejob, too. In many overseas postings, companies also pay aneducation allowance so parents can send their children to&quot;American&quot; schools there. Five weeks of vacation is common.   OGE Drilling workers who go back will get hazard duty payof 15% to 20% even above what they'd normally earn in theMiddle East, Mr. Schaub says. The plan is to work shifts offour weeks in Kuwait and four weeks home. Workers willreceive an extra bonus of about 10% if they return after thefirst stint.   John Henry Cole isn't sure that's enough. He's stillundecided about whether to return. Mr. Cole hid for a monthoutside Kuwait City and ran into Iraqi troops every time hetried to escape across the desert. Captured at gunpoint andmoved to Iraq, he spent three months as a human shield in arefinery outside Baghdad.   His wife, Donnita, has spent the two months since hereturned to his Odessa, Texas, home fattening him up -- hehad lost 40 pounds. &quot;I'm not going to let him out of my sightagain,&quot; she vows. In tears, his oldest daughter has pleadedwith him to find work closer to home. But finding a job as anoil-rig drilling supervisor in the U.S. has proved tough.&quot;I've looked a little bit, but it's pretty slow right now,&quot;Mr. Cole says.   He laments that oil is, after all, in a lot of riskyplaces. The 50-year-old Texan escaped from Libya when Col.Moammar Gadhafi took power in a coup in 1969, lived throughtwo armed uprisings in Nigeria and fled from Iran nine daysafter the shah did, all because of job assignments.   Royce &quot;Red&quot; Smart, a 59-year-old oil-field worker fromLiberty, Texas, who was held in Iraq, won't rule out a Kuwaitjob because it would pay so much more than the one he has nowwith a domestic company drilling a well near the Mexicanborder. Still, he's not jumping at the chance to return tothe Middle East because he hasn't completely shaken thewillies from his experiences as a captive. &quot;I never did getover being locked {up},&quot; he says. &quot;That stayed with me.&quot;   Some former hostages definitely won't return. &quot;I still attimes have lots of trouble controlling my emotions,&quot; says onewho requests anonymity. &quot;I just break down and cry and can'tspeak.&quot;   At the Amos home in the small Texas town of Gilmer, Mr.Amos got his life back at his own pace, says his wife,Sarrah. &quot;I just fed him real good,&quot; she says. But evenchicken fried steak, baked potatoes and homemade fried fruitpies can't completely obliterate the terror and the worrythat it could happen again. Before Mr. Amos's captivity, hiswife called him every other Sunday in Kuwait. But in the twoweeks he has been in Houston, away from home for the firsttime since his release, his wife has called him every night.Being separated, says Mr. Amos, &quot;is harder than it used tobe.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
