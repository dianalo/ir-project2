(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A company that keeps tabs on the aircraftindustry reports jet aircraft orders are booming as commercialairlines worldwide modernize their fleets with more fuel-efficientaircraft.   The company, Forecast International, says more than 3,400aircraft worth $114 billion are either on order or on option toorder, most to be delivered over the next six years.   In 15 years of tracking aircraft developments, ``I've never,never seen a replacement cycle like this,'' said company PresidentEdward M. Nebinger.   He said Tuesday airlines are ordering new planes because theycan save 20 to 25 percent on fuel costs with newer models, withfuel being an airline company's largest operational expense.   Nebinger also said the industry had weathered an era ofcutthroat competition, prompted partly by the deregulation of theindustry a decade ago, that has seen less-efficient carriers foldamid a series of mergers and consolidations.   ``The survivors are economically stronger,'' he said.   Newer models also reduce the risk of metal fatigue, whichliterally can cause a plane to fall apart.   Nebinger recalled this year's Aloha Airlines incident, when theentire front section of the cabin roof flew off in flight, due tofatigue cracks. That plane had made 90,000 takeoffs and landings,he said.   The Aloha Airlines incident and the recent crash of a1973-vintage Boeing 727 jet in Dallas renewed questions about thereliability of aging aircraft, Nebinger said.   His figures indicate the average age of a Boeing 707 is 20.3years, while the average age of a Boeing 727 is 15.4 years. Theaverage age of a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 is 21.4 years and theaverage age of a DC-10 is 12 years.   Forecast International maintains computer data on aircraftinventories worldwide.   Nebinger said jet planes are the last major items that theUnited States exports and his data provide encouraging news as theUnited States attempts to trim its trade deficit.   U.S. manufacturers are expected to deliver 1,738 new aircraft,worth about $72.5 billion, through 1994. Of that, $25.4 billion isdestined for American airline companies, while the remaining $47.1billion will go to foreign customers, Nebinger said.   But he also said European companies, specifically AirbusIndustrie, are taking an ever-increasing bite of the market awayfrom U.S. giants like Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which 15 yearsago claimed virtually the entire world market.   He said Airbus Industrie was expected to deliver 852 aircraftthrough 1995, while other European producers will deliver about575. Much of those will go to countries other than the UnitedStates, but about $12.8 billion will go to U.S. operators, he said.   On balance, Nebinger said, ``the U.S. still emerges as a verystrong winner in the import-export balance, with exports to Europeexceeding imports by $13.2 billion.''   The impact on the U.S. trade deficit, he said, ``cannot beoveremphasized.''   Boeing has 1,275 aircraft either on order or option to order.McDonnell Douglas has 349. Airbus Industrie has 852, while Fokker,based in the Netherlands, has 257, and Embraer of Brazil has 208,according to Nebinger's numbers.   To support the orders his company has tracked, new enginesneeded through 1994 will be worth $24.7 billion, Nebinger said, ofwhich U.S. manufacturers will produce $15.6 billion, or 63 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
