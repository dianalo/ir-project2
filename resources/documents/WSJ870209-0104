The link applies to the 56 U.S. stocks traded on the Paris exchange. Albert Anderson, president of the Midwest exchange's Midwest Securities Trust Co., said the link could bring almost immediate settlement of trades in those U.S. stocks, compared with current delays of a week or more.    Exchange officials said they expect the link to be expanded later to include other U.S. stocks as well as French stocks traded in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
