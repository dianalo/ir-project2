President Corazon Aquino clasped the hands of Defense SecretaryFidel Ramos and Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa on Epifanio delos Santos Avenue.   It was along the broad avenue, known popularly as EDSA, thathundreds of thousands of civilians rallied to support militarymutineers in the uprising that forced the former president from thecountry on Feb. 25, 1986.   As church bells pealed Thursday, a Philippine air force T-28swooped low over the crowd dragging a banner reading ``PeoplePower.'' Police estimated that by 8:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. WednesdayEST) about 20,000 people had packed the avenue for the all-daycelebrations.   Leftists scheduled their own rallies Thursday at which theyplanned to accuse Mrs. Aquino of abandoning the reformist goals ofthe 1986 revolution. On Wednesday, about 20,000 people marchedalong the boulevard and burned an effigy of Mrs. Aquino.   During celebrations Thursday, armored personnel carriers carriedimages of the Virgin Mary in a procession along Epifanio avenue.Officials said the images were the ones carried by priests and nunsduring the 1986 revolt.   Roman Catholic Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, archbishop of Manila, saidin a radio broadcast that the celebrations showed ``we wantbrotherhood and not bloodshed.''   In 1986, Sin called on Filipinos to fill the streets to supportmutineers led by Ramos and former Defense Minister Juan PonceEnrile.   They had broken with Marcos, charging him with fraud in the Feb.7, 1986, presidential election in which he ran against Mrs. Aquino.The rebels' action galvanized the opposition that began after the1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Mrs.Aquino's husband.   Marcos fled to Hawaii.   During a leftist protest Wednesday, about 200 police officersblocked the road leading to the military's Camp Crame in suburbanQuezon City as helicopters hovered above. The crowd of students,workers, farmers and Roman Catholic clergy dispersed withoutincident after three hours of anti-government speeches.   The leftist protesters chanted ``dismantle the U.S.-Aquinoregime'' and burned effigies of Mrs. Aquino. Red banners said``Advance the People's Genuine Revolution'' and one poster read:``Cory _ Closet Dictator.''   ``We had high hopes when Cory Aquino said she would be the exactopposite of Marcos. But after two years, we have no more hope thatshe will fulfill her promises,'' Crispin Beltran, head of themilitant May First Movement labor organization, told the rally.   People distributed leaflets of the outlawed National DemocracticFront, the umbrella organization of 12 Marxist groups including theCommunist Party and its armed wing, the New People's Army.   ``The Aquino government has betrayed the Filipino people's hopefor fundamental changes in society after ousting Marcos...,'' theDemocratic Front statement said.   Also Wednesday, Mrs. Aquino denied charges by the wife of adiscredited navy officer that Ramos was involved in a November 1986coup attempt.   ``As far as I'm concerned, General Ramos has proven himself notonly now but in the past, especially in his abiding by theconstitution,'' she told reporters. ``He has not been any part ofany coup attempt.''   Ramos also denied the charges by Marilyn Robles, wife of Capt.Rex Robles.   The plot involved killing leftist officials, installing amilitary junta and reducing Mrs. Aquino to the role of a figurehead.</TEXT></DOC>
