But fire bosses worried that storms in several of the burnedareas could also bring lightning and the potential for new blazes.   Twenty fires were burning on more than 110,000 acres in eightstates _ Arizona, California, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, NewMexico, Nevada and Utah, according to the federal Boise InteragencyFire Center in Idaho.   Rain helped the 11,000 firefighters working on the lines, butofficials issued a ``red flag'' warning because of thunderstormsthat are expected to move from northern Arizona across Nevada, theSierra Nevada range of California, eastern Oregon, Idaho and Montanain the next two days.   Officials at the firefighting coordinating agency fear the stormscould add to the more than 70,000 lightning strikes recorded acrossthe West during the past week, mostly in the past two days.   ``It's a mixed blessing ... the chance of rain versus the chanceof lightning,'' Jerry Larson, deputy Nebraska fire marshal, saidtoday.   Half an inch of rain poured on the Boulder Canyon fire overnight,helping about 180 firefighters get the 2,000-acre blaze 90 percentcontained, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Melissa Carlson inBoulder.   The fire, which broke out Sunday, razed 37 homes and damagednumerous other structures on private property.   More rain was expected today, and firefighters hoped to containthe blaze inside a ring of bare earth this evening.   Boulder County Sheriff Brad Leach said the blaze began with``carelessly discarded'' smoking material near a trailer owned byMitch Steiner of Boulder, but that there was insufficient evidencefor charges.   In an interview broadcast Tuesday on KCNC-TV in Denver, Steiner,28, said he went to the trailer for a few minutes Sunday to pick uptools, but said he was sure he hadn't smoked or dropped anythingburning.   The federal firefighting center gave the Boulder Canyon Blaze thehighest priority because of the damage to property and the threat itposed to inhabited areas.   Residents were allowed back into the area, but the sheriff'soffice was advising people against staying overnight.   In Arizona, a firefighter was struck dead by lightning on Monday,becoming the second fatality of the fire season. A firefighter inCalifornia was killed by a falling tree on Sunday.   Rain helped crews contain or control nearly all the fires thatburned 50,000 acres in southern Arizona. Officials also expected tobring under control today a 1,700-acre blaze near the Grand Canyon'sNorth Rim tourist lodge, which had threatened a historic huntingcabin used by President Theodore Roosevelt, said Wendell Peacock ofthe U.S. Bureau of Land Management.   Several other fires were burning out of control in central andnorthern Arizona, including an 800-acre blaze that threatened theHavasu National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to nesting baldeagles, and a 500-acre fire in the Tonto National Forest.   The nation's biggest fire was in northwestern Nebraska, whereplanes dumped fire-retardant chemicals on a blaze that burnedbetween 50,000 and 100,000 acres on ranchland and in Fort RobinsonState Park, where Sioux Chief Crazy Horse was killed.   Firefighters used heavy equipment and shovels to dig a line ofbare earth around the burning area, said Larson, the deputy firemarshal. The blaze was declared fully contained late this morning.   ``The fire is now well within the established fire line. Theweather is cooperating, the winds have died down,'' Larson said.   ``We are cautiously optimistic that the worst part of the fire isover,'' Gov. Kay Orr said on a tour of the burned area Tuesday.   Officials planned to open the park Friday. The fire was ignitedby lightning Saturday.   Nine people have been treated at a hospital for minor injuriessince the blaze began, Larson said.   Elsewhere:   _ Good weather helped firefighters encircle two brush fires innorthern California that burned more than 8,000 acres, but toughgoing was reported today in the battle against a blaze at Big Sur onthe coast. The Big Sur fire, believed to be arson, charred nearly3,000 acres of growth, and firefighters hoped to contain it by 6p.m. today, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Maeton Freel.   _ At Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado, the U.S.Forest Service decided today to reopen all but a few sections to thepublic, said John Pasquantino, fire information officer. Fivelightning-caused fires Tuesday night were quickly quelled afterscorching 2,600 acres, and Indian cliff dwellings abandoned in the13th Century were undamaged, he said.   _ Crews contained a 1,000-acre brush fire in Utah that hadprompted the temporary shutdown of a 345,000-volt line relayingelectricity in the West. And nearly 400 firefighters finished a fireline around a 15,500-acre fire west of the Colorado line.   _ Authorities in Yellowstone National Park moved quickly toextinguish a lightning-caused fire that burned a tenth of an acreMonday. It was the first natural fire of the season to be snuffedout following the suspension of the ``let burn'' policy, which wascriticized after last year's massive blazes.   Elswhere in Wyoming, rehabilitation work began Tuesday in a3,500-acre section of the Bridger-Teton National Forest scorched bya blaze that was contained Monday. Full control was predicted forMonday.</TEXT></DOC>
