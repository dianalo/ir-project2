Toshiki Kaifu made that prophecy reality Tuesday as he was votedto head the Liberal Democratic Party, assuring him of becomingJapan's 19th postwar premier.   A few weeks ago it seemed most unlikely. Kaifu didn't figure inthe early race to succeed Sousuke Uno, who is stepping down afterless than two months in the wake of his party's thrashing in recentparliamentary elections.   But with senior party leaders virtually eliminated from servingin the nation's highest office because of their own links to aninfluence-peddling scandal, Kaifu was called on as an experiencedpolitician with a clean image to lead the party out of its currentcrisis.   The head of the Liberal Democrats becomes prime minister becauseof the party's majority in the lower house of Parliament. Kaifu isexpected to be formally named on Wednesday.   The party lost its majority in the upper house in an electionlast month, forcing Uno, already besieged by charges that he keptpaid mistresses, to take responsibility for the setback and resign.   ``We must overcome the obstacles, which I deeply regret,'' Kaifutold party members in a speech Monday. ``We must seriously considerthe harsh reality of the election results.''   A veteran politician who served as education minister in theCabinets of two prime ministers, Kaifu is Japan's second-youngestpostwar leader. Only Kakuei Tanaka, premier in 1972-74, wasyounger, taking office at age 54.   An eloquent speaker who studied debating in college, Kaifulearned his political ropes as a protege of the late Prime MinisterTakeo Miki, and was once considered a future party heavyweight.   His influence waned, however, as the small intra-party factionto which he belonged became overshadowed by larger groupings withinthe party.   The Liberal Democrats turned to him amid calls for a youngerleadership, and because of his support for political reform, whichhe inherited from Miki.   He was also a compromise candidate between the main rivalfactions, whose leaders were tainted by the so-called Recruit Co.scandal. Kaifu himself has acknowledged receiving $108,000 indonations from Recruit, but has claimed they were all legitimatepolitical contributions.   He moved quickly to repair damage to the Liberal Democrats sinceformally declaring his candidacy on Friday, appealing particularlyto women, who felt estranged by allegations about Uno's affairs anda new consumption tax forced into law by the party earlier thisyear.   ``We must think of constructing a social balance between men andwomen that respects women's place in society and makes use of theirabilities,'' he said in his Monday speech.   Kaifu's drawbacks are a lack of experience in foreign andfinancial affairs, not heading his own faction and never havingserved a top party post. Some political analysts therefore believehis administration will end in October when the Liberal Democratselect a new party president for a two-year term.   Others, however, believe Kaifu could last longer, depending onhow he fares in the coming three months.   ``If he succeeds in hammering out his own color and philosophy,there is a possibility his administration could last anunexpectedly long time,'' Gakushuin University law professorHidekazu Kawai told the newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun.   Kaifu considers the number 29 particularly significant. Asidefrom his vow at age 29, he graduated from prestigious WasedaUniversity in the 29th year of the reign of the late EmperorHirohito, and was first elected to Parliament in Japan's 29thgeneral election.</TEXT></DOC>
