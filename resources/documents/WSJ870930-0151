The agreement, which is likely to be endorsed by central bank governors by early next year, could cause banks in some countries to have to strengthen their capital.    The officials, who are attending the annual meetings here of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, said common standards could be agreed upon by experts by November and rubber-stamped by central bank governors from the ten leading industrial countries at their regular monthly meeting at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, in January.    The new standards would seek to establish a clear, harmonized definition of bank capital for bank regulators and set minimum requirements for bank capital as a percentage of a bank's balance sheet assets outstanding. The new rules would be phased in over a number of years to enable banks to adjust to them. They could cause banks in some countries, including France and Japan, to boost their capital.    Negotiating a common standard for capital adequacy has been fraught with difficulty. Regulations differ widely between countries on how to judge items such as shareholders' equity, hidden reserves, provisions against doubtful loans or subordinated debt as capital. Similarly, national regulations differ greatly over how to distinguish between risks such as loans to governments in industrial countries or Third World debtors.    But work toward an agreement among the major industrial countries gathered steam after the Bank of England and U.S. regulatory authorities reached agreement in principle in February on minimum standards for capital adequacy for banks.    The Anglo-U.S agreement, which is the model being discussed in the present negotiations, established a system of different weightings for differing types of risk.    The Japanese authorities later joined in the discussions, which were then extended to include bank supervisors from continental European countries in the so-called Cooke Committee of bank supervisors in Basel.    The issue of harmonizing banking rules has grown in importance with the globalization of financial markets. National regulations, which evolved over generations, also have needed to be revised to cope with innovations such as swaps and securitization, which have greatly increased the volume of business that doesn't appear on a traditional balance sheet.    But central bank officials say establishing greater convergence in supervisory policies won't create a level playing field in international banking. Differing accountancy conventions and taxation policies will ensure that major differences remain between national banking groups on issues such as making provisions for Third World debt.    In West Germany, for example, banks have set aside large amounts to cover Third World debtor risks because they have been allowed to offset their provisions against tax. Alfred Herrhausen, the joint chief executive of Deutsche Bank AG, disclosed here that his bank has now made provisions for 70% of its loans outstanding to problem debtors and intends to set aside still more at the end of this year.    British and U.S. banks, by contrast, have set aside between 25% and 30% of their exposure. Japanese banks, which have no opportunity to offset provisions against tax, have hardly started to cover their debt exposure. </TEXT></DOC>
