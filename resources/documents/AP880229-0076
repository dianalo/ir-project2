(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Patty Rosier picked at her last meal,kissed her children goodbye and rested in bed with her husband.They talked and wept and hugged, he said, and then she swallowed ahandful of sleeping pills.   ``My wife wanted to sleep. To just fall into a restful sleep anddie. She took the drugs herself. Her last words to me were, `I loveyou, Peter,''' Peter Rosier said in an interview published Sunday.   Rosier, a Fort Myers physician, is charged with first-degreemurder in the death of his 43-year-old wife on Jan. 15, 1986. Histrial is scheduled to begin April 18, and prosecutors say they willseek the death penalty if he is convicted.   Mrs. Rosier did not die from the sleeping pills, nor frominjections of morphine which her husband allegedly gave her aftershe lapsed into a coma. The woman's stepfather, Vincent Delman ofNew York City, says that he finally suffocated her.   Delman has been granted immunity from prosecution. Prosecutor EdVolz says Rosier conspired in the death of his wife and can betried for first-degree murder.   Authorities investigated the death only after Rosier talkedabout the circumstances on television.   Mrs. Rosier was diagnosed in April 1985 as having lung cancer.Rosier quit his job as head of the pathology department at LeeMemorial Hospital to be with his wife, whose treatment at firstseemed successful.   Six months later, doctors found brain tumors. Soon there weremore tumors, in her abdomen and on her skin, Rosier said.   ``She was incurable. She was going to die. She felt, why gothrough that torture (radiation therapy) all over again,'' Rosier,46, said in an interview published in Sunday's editions of TheMiami Herald. ``My wife chose to end her life.''   It was Rosier's first interview since he was indicted inSeptember.   He said he and his wife of 22 years had planned at first to dietogether.   ``We spent an entire day going over the assets, which Realtorwould sell the home, how to dispose of the property. ... I told thechildren I could not live without Patty. But then I realized it wasmy responsibilty to stay with them,'' he said of their children,Jacob, now 20, and Elizabeth, 19.   On the night of her planned death, Mrs. Rosier invited familyand friends for a last visit. She gave them gifts and had a catereddinner, although she was too ill to eat.   Later, Rosier helped her to the bedroom. The couple made love.They talked.   ``I had had an affair earlier on in our marriage. I asked heragain if she had forgiven me,'' he recalled. ``She said, `You knowI've forgiven you thousands of times.' We talked about a lot ofthings. About whether there was a God ... About how much we weregoing to miss each other. She wasn't scared. I was.''   Then she took the drugs.   ``I couldn't bear to be with her after she'd fallen asleep. Ileft the room,'' he said. Twelve hours later, Mrs. Rosier was stillalive.   Delman has said that Rosier attempted in vain to end his wife'slife with injections of morphine. Finally, the stepfatherintervened.   ``I decided to cover her mouth and her nose. ... I mean it waspathetic to see this lady in bed and all this stuff going on for11, 12, 10 hours, whatever it was. So the thing is to end it,''Delman said in depositions.   The body was cremated within 48 hours.   Months after his wife's death, Rosier commission a scriptwriterto produce a screenplay from a book he wrote about her death. Thenhe went on television and during an interview said he helped hiswife die, a confession that sparked the criminal investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
