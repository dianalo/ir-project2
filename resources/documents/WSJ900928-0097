Instead ofbuying a stock and hoping that the price will rise, shortsellers borrow a stock and immediately sell it, hoping theprice will decline. Eventually, these &quot;shorts&quot; have to buyshares to replace the ones they borrowed, but if the pricedrops enough in the meantime, they make a profit.</LP><TEXT>   Some short sellers &quot;are making a great deal of money&quot; inthe current market, says Hugo Quackenbush, senior vicepresident at Charles Schwab andamp; Co. The discount brokerage firmreports that its number of shares of stock borrowed, anindicator of short selling, is up 15% since July.&quot;Sophisticated investors are shorting more stocks,&quot; says Mr.Quackenbush.   Short selling isn't for everyone, however. The danger isthat the price of the stock will rise instead fall, causinginvestors to lose money -- and the size of the loss ispotentially unlimited. If, for instance, an investor shorts astock at $20 and it rises instead to $100 or $200, theinvestor will eventually have to &quot;cover&quot; the short sale bypurchasing the stock at the higher price.   That makes short selling especially risky in volatilemarkets, when stock prices are moving up and down sharply.Even now, at a time when the direction of prices has beenmostly down, some advisers see danger.   Stan Weinstein, editor of the Professional Tape Reader, aHollywood, Fla., newsletter, says it doesn't make sense &quot;todo aggressive shorting&quot; after a 500-point decline in themarket. &quot;There are bound to be some oversold rallies in thisbear market,&quot; he says, advising would-be short sellers towait until the market moves higher.   The nature of short selling also eliminates a usualbenefit of stocks -- receiving a dividend. Indeed, dividendsare an additional expense because the short seller must payany dividends that the company declares to the person heborrowed the stock from.   Still a number of investment professionals say that shortselling can be worth a try for someone willing to take therisks, do the homework, and stay on top of dailydevelopments. &quot;Selling short makes fantastic money in downmarkets,&quot; says Neil Dolinsky, a portfolio manager at C.C.Dunnavan andamp; Co., a Minneapolis money management firm.   &quot;We always say the trend is your friend,&quot; says JohnBrooks, a technical analyst at Davis Mendel andamp; Regenstein, anAtlanta brokerage firm. &quot;Well the trend is down, and{investors} should go with the flow -- at least for part oftheir portfolio.&quot;   Mr. Brooks suggests looking for short-sale candidatesamong companies with weak earnings, heavy insider selling andshare prices below their 200-day moving averages. &quot;In thiskind of market, the weak get weaker. You will have plenty ofcandidates. Very few fish will swim upstream,&quot; Mr. Brookssays.   Sifting through the short-sale candidates requiresinvestors to do more of their own research than if they werelooking for stocks to buy, or &quot;go long,&quot; says Michael Murphy,editor of Overpriced Stock Service, a San Francisco shortselling newsletter. &quot;On the long side, companies, brokeragefirms, public relations agencies and investment bankers willgive you all kinds of help in finding underpriced stocks.&quot;But on the short side, &quot;they will give you no help.&quot;   But that's also a plus, Mr. Murphy says. Instead ofcompeting with thousands of analysts, brokers and moneymanagers searching for underpriced stocks, individuals areoperating in &quot;a relatively inefficient part of the stockmarket&quot; competing with a small group of short selling pros,he says.   For those who want try to make some money on the shortside, here are some tips on minimizing the risks involved:                                                                                                          DON'T GO OVERBOARD. Mr. Murphy recommends that individualinvestors devote only a small percentage of their capital toshort selling. Mr. Weinstein suggests that investorsdiversify their short sales with six to 10 different stocks.                                                                                                          LIMIT LOSSES. To reduce the potential loss if the price ofa shorted stock goes up instead of down, some pros suggest&quot;stop-buy&quot; orders. These are instructions to your broker tobuy the stock when it reaches a price of, say 10% to 25% overthe price you shorted the stock at. &quot;You have to be able toprotect yourself if the stock runs away on the upside,&quot; saysMr. Quackenbush of Charles Schwab.   Mr. Murphy says he sets a 25% stop-buy order on hisshorts. &quot;If our analysis is wrong or our timing is off, weare better off taking a 25% loss, coming back later withfresh eyes, and seeing what we want to do about it,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          DODGE &quot;SHORT SQUEEZES.&quot; A short squeeze is what happenswhen the price of a heavily shorted stock rises and shortsellers have to compete against each other to buy enoughshares to cover their positions. The result can be a buyingfrenzy that drives the stock price even higher with shortsellers taking heavier and heavier losses.   In a typical short sale, brokers require investors todeposit 50% of the market value of the shares borrowed in amargin, or credit account, to cover potential losses. If thestock's price rises, investors will get &quot;margin&quot; calls to putin more money whenever the deposit falls below a certainpercentage of the stock's market value.   One way to dodge a short squeeze is to avoid thinly tradedstocks, says Mr. Quackenbush. &quot;Individuals should stay awayfrom a stock with {only} 200,000 shares outstanding, forexample,&quot; he adds.   Mr. Murphy says it's also a good idea for individualinvestors to avoid trying to short the stocks with thelargest &quot;short interest&quot; -- the number of shares that haven'tyet been purchased for return to lenders. &quot;That's aprofessional's game -- a war between the shorts and longs,&quot;he says, and &quot;it's best to say out of those contests.&quot;                                                                                                          AVOID EMOTIONAL HANGUPS. Finally, the pros say, investorswho short a stock shouldn't feel that they are doingsomething unethical. &quot;When you buy a stock long, you feellike you've purchased a piece of America,&quot; says Mr. Brooks,the Atlanta brokerage-firm analyst. But that doesn't meanthat shorting a stock is un-American, he and others say.   Indeed, Mr. Murphy adds, &quot;By pushing overpriced stocksdown, short selling makes capital markets more efficient.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
