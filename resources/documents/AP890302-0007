More than 27,600 asylum-seekers arrived last year at theSchwalbach camp just outside Frankfurt, roughly one quarter of thenationwide total.   And they are still coming at a record pace, despite thecontroversy surrounding them and charges that many come not insearch of freedom from political persecution but for their owneconomic betterment.   ``Germany is good and maybe they will grant me politicalasylum,'' said a 28-year-old Nigerian standing in the crowded hallsof the tidy, modern camp here.   He explained that fighting between Christians and Moslems in hiscountry led him to come.   A 21-year-old Tamil said Indian troops sent to his native SriLanka prompted his departure.   Marem Taraky, a 40-year-old teacher from Kabul in Afghanistansaid she will stay out of her country ``until peace returns.''   Most of the asylum-seekers arriving at the Frankfurt airport aredriven by bus to the camp, which is at the end of a mud-coveredroad. But some, usually people who arrived with tourist visas, takethe subway in Frankfurt to the end of the line and walk the rest ofthe way.   West German officials say some people cross on foot over WestGermany's southern borders.   ``Some Poles come here directly with their cars and say, `Here Iam,''' said Volker Moeser, the camp director.   So far this year, the largest number of refugees arriving at thestate-run Schwalbach camp have come from Turkey, followed in orderby Sri Lanka, Poland, Iran, Afghanistan, India, Ghana, Yugoslavia,Somalia and Lebanon.   Moeser said some of the refugees _ mainly the ones who speak someEnglish or German _ are aware of the heated political debatesurrounding the political asylum issue.   Asylum-seekers throughout the country occasionally are thetargets of violence.   On Feb. 14, unknown assailants fire-bombed a home forasylum-seekers in the northern Bavarian town of Memmelsdorf. Damagewas minor, and none of the 15 Poles and Hungarians inside wereinjured.   A similar attack took place at a home for asylum-seekers innearby Bamberg the following day. About the same time as thatattack, five so-called ``skinheads'' picked a fight with an Indianasylum-seeker in the Hesse state town of Schluechtern, injuring therefugee and two skinheads.   While violence still is limited, general dissatisfaction amongGermans with the number of asylum-seekers continues to grow afterthe number hit 103,076 last year.   That was reflected by the surprisingly strong showing by theright-wing extremist Republican Party in West Berlin elections inJanuary. The party ran on a platform calling for expulsion ofasylum-seekers as well as foreign workers, whom West Germanywelcomed in the early years of its postwar economic boom.   The rising negative sentiment has led Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sChristian Democratic Union (CDU) to set up a committee to work outmeasures for ``the prevention of massive abuse of the asylum laws.''   Under the current system, anyone who claims that he or she facespersecution back home generally is entitled to seek asylum alongwith immediate family members.   Kohl says his coalition government is most interested inexcluding ``economic asylum seekers,'' people who are mainlyinterested in escaping poverty back home. Other reported abusesinclude cases of East Europeans who come in search of asylum butoccasionally go back home for visits.   The chancellor promised quick action but did not outline anytimetable.   ``We're looking into steps that can be taken without a change inthe constitution,'' CDU member of parliament Michael Maiworm toldreporters in Bonn.   The chairman of the group is Johannes Gerster, a ChristianDemocratic member of parliament who already has called for hearingson asylum requests within 48 hours of arrival in West Germany. Ashortening of the appeals process is also under review.   The Free Democrats, the junior partner in Kohl's coalition, havealready signalled a willingness to tighten up the political asylumprocedures in this country of 61.3 million people.   While generally less than 10 percent of the asylum-seekers aregranted such status, lengthy legal proceedings and other policiesoften allow the refugees to stay in West Germany almostindefinitely. That includes a ban on sending people back to regionswracked by war or other widespread violence.   As a general rule, the asylum-seekers are barred from working inWest Germany for either one year or five years, depending on theirstatus. That means they live at government expense, often lodged inhotels or guest houses.   The Bild am Sonntag newspaper published an article recentlyclaiming that asylum-seekers will cost West Germany $2.8 billionthis year.</TEXT></DOC>
