Eastern has sought steep pay concessions from its employees since it was acquired by cost-sensitive Texas Air Corp. of Houston last year. The unions have resisted, and Miami-based Eastern announced layoffs last month of roughly 9% of its work force -- and threatened more unless the unions agree to wage cuts and tougher work rules.    A showdown is all but inevitable, the Machinists union believes. Union leaders distributed a bulletin to the 12,000 members yesterday warning: &quot;From this day forward, you must assume that Eastern Airlines intends to force a strike, and you must be prepared for the worst.&quot; The bulletin went on to advise its members, &quot;Arm yourself by putting your financial house in the best possible order you can.&quot; The Eastern machinists last walked off the job in 1966 for 43 days over a contract dispute.    Both sides say they want to avoid a strike, which could potentially force a shutdown of the financially troubled carrier. &quot;A strike is not in the best interest of either party,&quot; said a spokesman for Eastern. &quot;We have a long way to go before we get to that point.&quot;    Union officials accused the company of prematurely declaring an impasse in the contract talks, as a means of accelerating a confrontation. Texas Air, at its Continental Airlines unit, has in the past replaced striking employees with lower-paid, nonunion workers. And just as Texas Air management has earned a reputation for cutting labor costs, the Eastern machinists are considered one of the most militant and vocal unions in the industry. When other Eastern unions agreed to wage concessions two years ago, the machinists held firm.    Eastern declared an impasse after eight meetings with the machinists held between Oct. 12 and Nov. 10. Both sides then sought federal mediation, but no mediator has yet been appointed. The Machinists' contract becomes amendable Dec. 31.    &quot;The union's contention is Eastern is trying to short-circuit the process,&quot; said Joseph Guerrieria, a union attorney who filed suit in federal court to compel the company to negotiate in good faith. &quot;It became clear that while Eastern was going through the motions of bargaining, there was no intention of reaching an agreement. They wanted to force an impasse and a strike.&quot;    Eastern, however, asserts that it is the machinists who aren't negotiating seriously. The company proposed, for example, to cut the pay of Eastern baggage handlers, who are represented by the Machinists union, to $8 an hour in two years from $15.60 an hour currently. The union countered with a $10-an-hour pay raise request. &quot;They called it a tongue-in-cheek offer,&quot; said the Eastern spokesman. &quot;If that's good-faith bargaining, we don't see it that way.&quot;    Ronald Orr, district chairman for the Machinists, said the union's salary demand wasn't serious. &quot;Obviously we know that's ridiculous,&quot; he said. &quot;But we did that to show how ridiculous their pay cuts are.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
