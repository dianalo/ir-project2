Jefferies aprison sentence could send the wrong message to future Wall Streetfelons: break the law and you won't do time, some legal experts say.   But others maintain that Jefferies, who admitted to two felonyviolations of federal securities laws, has more than paid his priceby cooperating with government investigators and quitting the LosAngeles brokerage that bears his name.   Jefferies, 58, who gave the government crucial informationleading to three indictments and one conviction, was sentencedThursday by a federal judge to five years of probation and fined$250,000.   The sentence was only the second in the Wall Street corruptionscandal triggered by infamous stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, whowas sentenced by the same judge to three years in prison.   ``I think the public will view this as a slap on the wrist,''said Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor at Southern MethodistUniversity. ``I think the dividing line in the mind of the public ishard time or no hard time.   ``The $250,000 would be a lot of money for most people, but Isuspect it's not going to put Jefferies into bankruptcy court,'' headded. ``So the bottom line is nothing very serious happened tohim.''   But several securities defense lawyers, including formerprosecutors, said the term was appropriate, for many of the samereasons cited by U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker in his sentencing.   Lasker told a packed courtroom that he suspended imposition ofany jail term _ which could change if Jefferies violates probation _in large part because of Jefferies' cooperation with prosecutors.   He also said that the violations to which Jefferies admitted werenot as serious as Boesky's insider trading admissions and had neverbeen prosecuted criminally at the time of Jefferies' transgressions,in 1985 and 1986.   ``The violations he pleaded to, while I wouldn't said they weretechnical, they certainly had not previously been the subject ofcriminal investigation,'' said securities lawyer John F. Olson, whohas reviewed insider trading legislation for the American BarAssociation.   In addition, Jefferies did not profit personally from the schemesin which admitted a role: helping Boesky conceal ownership of $56million in stock and filing a phony $3 million invoice to coverlosses, and helping speculator Salim B. Lewis manipulate the stockprice of Fireman's Fund Corp.   ``Basically, he was accommodating customers and that's amitigating factor,'' said Sam Scott Miller, a New York securitieslawyer. ``It doesn't make it OK but it puts you in a differentcategory than some of the culprits.   ``Boyd Jefferies was not Ivan Boesky,'' added Miller, whorepresented a company that owned the Jefferies andamp; Co. brokerage inthe early 1970s. ``Boyd may have crowded the line and wandered overit when he shouldn't have, but I'd call Ivan a hardcore offender.''   Boesky's three-year sentence should serve as the benchmark forother cases in which defendants reach plea agreements, lawyers said,because the degree of his crimes was so severe. ``Boesky is thecrook of the century,'' said one defense lawyer involved in aprominent fraud case, speaking anonymously.   Boesky paid $100 million to the Securities and ExchangeCommission and pleaded guilty to one felony count of filing falseinformation with the SEC to settle wideranging charges that he usedillegally obtained inside information to trade on the stocks ofpotential takeover targets.   Jefferies, who was implicated by Boesky, already has taken thestand at two mistrials in the GAF Corp. stock manipulation case andthe stock fraud trial of corporate raider and former Singer Co.Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian, who was convicted last month. He is totestify at the third GAF trial and the Lewis trail in the fall.   While praising Jefferies as a model of cooperation, Lasker chided``absurd and probably obscene'' Wall Street greed and said hissentence shouldn't be interpreted as weak.   ``It would be a great mistake ... if those of you in the audienceassumed that what Mr. Jefferies has been through is easy andtherefore not much of a penalty,'' the judge said.</TEXT></DOC>
