The Soviet-backed Afghan government, meanwhile, renewed its offerto negotiate with the guerrillas, whose moderate and hardlinefundamentalist factions remained divided over how to form an interimgovernment.   During a heavy snowstorm Sunday, Soviet troops turned over theirlast combat outpost, on the edge of Kabul airport.   Afghan soldiers raised their nation's red, black and green flag,and Soviet and Afghan troops cheered as the changeover was completed.   The Afghans arrived with luggage, blankets and other personalbelongings as well as automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.   The airport, the capital's key link to the outside world, hasbeen a frequent target of guerrilla rocket attacks but has not beenhit in more than a month.   A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said that weather permitting,the remaining 300 Soviet soldiers in Kabul would leave Tuesday, aday ahead of the deadline set by a U.N.-sponsored accord to end nineyears of Soviet intervention.   The last soldiers were guarding Kabul airport while the Sovietscompleted a food airlift to the capital which the guerrillas,supported by the United States, Pakistan and China, are expected tobesiege when the Red Army is gone.   A U.N. airlift of food, medicine and blankets was suspendedSunday after Ethiopia pulled out of the program, officials said.   An Ethiopian airliner made one flight to Kabul, unloaded 32 tonsof wheat and refused to return to the city, said Sadruddin Aga Khan,coordinator of the U.N. Office of Economic and HumanitarianAssistance to Afghanistan.   ``I'm not able to say if or when the next flight will be,'' AgaKhan said at a news conference in Islamabad, Pakistan.   The guerrillas have been fighting the government in a civil warthat began in 1978 when the communists seized power in a coup.   On Saturday, Afghan President Najib accused Pakistan of massingtroops along the border to invade and then annex Afghanistan.   Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Sunday dismissed theallegation, saying her nation had enough problems of its own without``foreign adventures.''   ``Let's see what the Afghan people decide for themselves,'' Ms.Bhutto told a news conference in Beijing on the second day of avisit to China.   At a briefing Sunday, Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman MohammadNabi Amani said a government declaration renewed a 2-year-old offerto negotiate with guerrilla commanders inside Afghanistan.   ``All countries are using Afghanistan for their own benefit. Weask them (the guerrillas) not to be tools of others but to bringpeace to the homeland and to help end the bloodshed,'' Amani said.   More than 1 million people have died in the war and hundreds ofthousands have fled to Iran and Pakistan.   In Islamabad, the leader of a moderate Afghan guerrilla factionwarned Sunday it may boycott talks on forming an interim governmentbecause of disputes with fundamentalists over including Iran-basedShiite guerrillas. The Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance is mainlySunni Moslem.   Zabihullah Mojaddidi, secretary-general of the Afghan NationalLiberation Front, charged that hardline fundamentalists within theguerrilla alliance were plotting to discredit moderate groups, buthe did not elaborate.   Guerrilla sources said private talks continued Sunday. A councilcalled to form a government met briefly Friday before disputesbetween the rival guerrilla factions stalled progress.   Kabul's population, meanwhile, has grown to more than 2 millionbecause of refugees from outlying areas seeking food and shelter,and the city is facing a severe food shortage.   The United Nations' Aga Khan said he was trying to find out whythe Ethiopians pulled out of the airlift. Last week, Egypt Airrefused to fly into the embattled city, saying security at theairport was inadequate.   The U.N. airlift originally was expected to supply Kabul with 360tons of supplies and was to be completed by Wednesday.   Aga Khan denied reports in Geneva and New York that the UnitedNations cut a deal with the guerrillas to allow airlifts to Kabul inexchange for food distribution in guerrilla-held areas.</TEXT></DOC>
