With the South Korean approval, the biotechnology concern said its foreign TPA licensee, Boehringer Ingelheim International G.m.b.H., has received marketing approval in five nations, including France, Austria, New Zealand and the Philippines.    As previously reported, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to license Genentech's TPA, pending further study. West German drug regulators must still consider the proposal before the license will become effective there.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Genentech's stock closed at $48, up 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
