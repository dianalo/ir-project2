WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   New Hampshire's survivors turn South on Wednesday for the nextmajor battleground of the presidential campaign, with TennesseanAlbert Gore Jr. hoping to waylay the front-runners on his homeground but Northerner Michael Dukakis saying he is concedingnothing.   Among the Republicans, George Bush is counting on superiororganization in the South to hold off Bob Dole, and Pat Robertsonis hoping a strong showing in South Carolina can give him a boostheading into the Super Tuesday primaries.   Democrat Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, said Tuesday inNew Hampshire, ``We're going to contest every one of those states.I think we're going to surprise some people in the South.''   Jesse Jackson, a Southerner like Gore, was welcoming the changeof scenery to a region where he has been at or near the top inpolls of Democratic voters. His support is particularly strongamong Southern blacks.   After New Hampshire, several candidates were heading to SouthDakota and Wyoming where lower-stake contests are scheduled betweennow and March 8.   But it is on that date, known as Super Tuesday, that more thanone-third of the states will vote, including most of the South, inthe closest thing ever to a national presidential primary. And mostof the candidates are responding by turning their attention, timeand money southward for what Gore called ``the main event'' of thecampaign.   What they will find is a massive territory where a thoroughtelevision campaign means buying airtime in 20 or more separate TVmarkets. That's an enormous expense and obstacle, particularly forthose such as Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon who are saddled withdebt.   Gore, the Tennessee senator who claimed a pass to Super Tuesdayregardless of New Hampshire's verdict, said in Washington onTuesday that Jackson would be his principal competitor in the South.   He criticized Jackson's defense-cut proposals, said his ownexperience was more ``directly relevant'' and said, ``Democrats inall parts of the country are really hungry for a victory in 1988and interested in finding a nominee who can offer the best chanceof beating the Republicans in the fall.''   Jackson, in recent speeches, has argued against what he says isa common though often-unspoken view that he cannot win in 1988because he is black, no matter how well he does in the South andelsewhere.   On the Republican side, Robertson was pointing to SouthCarolina's GOP contest on the Saturday before Super Tuesday. Theexpected low turnout of that primary, combined with Robertson'sconstituency of fundamentalist Christian voters, made thatBible-belt state a likely spot for another strong showing by theformer television preacher.   While Dole engaged Bush in the New Hampshire primary, the vicepresident was said to have a far superior organization throughoutthe South. It was a strong Southern organization _ in a much morelimited regional primary _ that rescued former Vice PresidentWalter Mondale's nomination hopes after he fell short in NewHampshire in 1984.   Still, Bill Brock, Dole's campaign manager, said of the Bushcampaign's claim to have a ``firewall of support'' in Southernstates: ``It's made of straw. Straw burns pretty fast.''   Gephardt, the Democratic winner in Iowa's caucuses last week,seemed a likely candidate to oppose Gore for themoderate-to-conservative Southern Democratic and independent votethat Gore has been trying to appeal to since laying out relativelyconservative stands on defense and foreign policy issues last fall.   Dukakis has a strong Southern organization and was seen asparticularly strong in Florida.   ``I think Gephardt is the one with the most potential to do wellamong Southern white voters, besides Gore,'' said Merle Black, aUniversity of North Carolina political scientist.   ``He can take votes away from Gore,'' said Claibourne Darden, anAtlanta-based polltaker and analyst.   Facing that possibility, Gore had begun stressing an appeal toblue-collar voters _ in contrast to his earlier strategy ofconcentrating on endorsements from the Southern politicalestablishment.   He toured a mill in North Carolina last week and stood in aVirginia train yard with Johnny Cash where he shouted, ``This partyand our country has to stand up for the average working men andwomen.''   The Southern campaign will include at least three Republicandebates and four among the Democrats.   Dukakis has been the most successful fund-raiser among theDemocratic candidates and thus at an advantage in the Southern TVwars. But Gore's campaign has been hoarding its money, and he saidhe will spend at least $2 million in the region.   Gore campaign manager Fred Martin said, ``We must do well onSuper Tuesday _ there's no ifs, ands or buts about it. We have athree-week campaign.''</TEXT></DOC>
