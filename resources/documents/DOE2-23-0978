<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-23-0978 </DOCNO><TEXT>An apparatus for the highly sensitive determination of residual organiccarbon in high-purity water is described. Organic carbon in high-puritywater is converted to carbon dioxide by chemical oxidation (K/sub 2/S/sub2/O/sub 8/, 200deg C, 30 kgf/cm/sup 2/). The resulting CO/sub 2/ canbe measured directly with a gas chromatograph. The amount of CO/sub 2/is directly proportional to the concentration of carbonaceous materialsin sample water. The analyzer developed consists of a degasser for removingthe dissolved CO/sub 2/ in sample water, a reactor for converting organicmaterial into CO/sub 2/, a gas/liquid separator for extraction of CO/sub2/ in hot water and vapor, and a gas chromatograph for measuring CO/sub2/ in extracting gas. The dynamic range for the organic carbon determinationwas 1{similar_to}100 ppb and the coefficient of variance at 1 ppb was20%. The present analytical operation took 20 min per a sample.</TEXT></DOC>
