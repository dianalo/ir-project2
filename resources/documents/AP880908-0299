The 2,600 members of the United Transportation Union at therailroad had planned to walk off their jobs at 12:01 a.m. CDTFriday, when a 36-day cooling-off period ends and the Chicago andamp;North Western Transportation Co. had planned to lay off 1,150 ofthe 2,300 union brakemen in its 10-state freight operation.   The Senate late Thursday gave unanimous approval to Simon's billimplementing recommendations of a presidential emergency board,which in July called for trimming 689 brakemen.   President Reagan appointed the panel in April to study the labordispute and seek a solution.   Simon predicted the measure would sail through the House onFriday and win quick approval from Reagan. He said the bill couldbe passed by late morning and signed an hour or so later by thepresident.   Under the Railway Labor act, Congress and the president havespecific authority to settle railroad disputes that threatennational commerce.   The railroad and the union have been battling for more than ayear over the size of train crews on Candamp;NW freight trains.   The company contends the brakemen's jobs are obsolete and thattrains can be run with a two- or three-man crew _ an engineer, aconductor and, in some cases, a fireman.   The union contends the brakemen _ two on each train's crew _ arenecessary to maintain railroad safety.   The two sides have failed to reach a compromise and earlier thisweek had implemented strike plans.   Don Markgraf, UTU general chairman, said he opposes federalintervention, but that the union would honor the settlement if itis approved by Congress.   The railroad expects Congress to push through the legislation,said Candamp;NW spokesman James Foote, but he noted that managementpersonnel had been deployed throughout the freight system and about8,000 replacement workers had been recalled.   Candamp;NW commuters also were bracing for a walkout _ the thirdthreatened this year.   The UTU struck Candamp;NW for about four hours Aug. 4, after anearlier cooling-off period imposed by President Reagan. During thatperiod, the special presidential board proposed a compromise to endthe impasse.   Both sides then rejected the proposal _ the one now going beforeCongress _ setting the stage for the August strike.   Congress, however, ended that strike quickly by imposing asecond cooling-off period.</TEXT></DOC>
