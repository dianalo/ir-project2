Gardner, (202) 268-5178.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On June 23, 1987, the Postal Servicepublished a proposed rule, which, among other things, would require mailerspreparing metered mail for others to list the meter serial numbers, meterholders, number of pieces mailed, and rate per piece for each meter usedin the mailing. 52 FR 23561. (Other portions of the proposed rule are adoptedin a separate document in today's issue.) The required information wouldbe extremely useful in efforts to curb the unauthorized use of postagemeters, which has resulted in revenue losses estimated at $30 million overtwo years. Although many adverse comments were received on this part ofthe proposal, those comments generally either failed to explain and supportthat opposition or relied on assumptions which are incorrect or were notpersuasively developed. Since the Postal Service is still convinced thatthis part of the proposal is much needed, but would like to have a betterappreciation of any factors which make it unduly burdensome or compromiseits effectiveness, we have decided to republish it for an additional commentperiod and will re-evaluate it based upon the further comments received.The adverse comments on the initial publication essentially argued thatthe required information would be unduly burdensome both to mailers andthe Postal Service, and a duplication of information already availablein post offices. Most of the comments were identical in content, with multipleresponses being received from some of the same commenters. The burden tothe mailers was considered to be such that presorting of metered mail mightno longer be of any value. The commenters did not consider the proposalto be cost effective for the Postal Service, in view of the additionalpersonnel and time thought to be required to receive, review, cross reference,audit and store the documentation. Many commenters considered the proposedrule a duplication of current procedures in 144.224 and 144.231 of theDomestic Mail Manual. These comments are mistaken. There is no duplication. the sections theycite pertain to six-month examinations of customers' meters by the PostalService, procedures for revoking a meter license when a meter is used inoperating any scheme or enterprise of an unlawful character or for nonuseduring any consecutive 12 months, or for any failure of the licensee tocomply with regulations governing the use of postage meters. The proposedrule calls for precise information on meter serial numbers, meter holders'names, pieces mailed and rate per piece_information not presently availableto the Postal Service. The Postal Service also has no reason to think that the proposed rule wouldbe burdensome to mailers, because the information is or should be availablein the normal course of business between meter users and commercial mailerswho prepare metered mail that is not their own or is not metered with theirmeter. The burden to the Postal Service is negligible in view of the potentialfor loss and the fact that the records are only intended to provide anaudit trail, as needed. These records are necessary to provide documentationto properly audit meter usage versus mail volume. The Postal Service considers recent revenue losses from unauthorized useof postage meters to be an unacceptable situation which cannot be allowedto continue. Further steps must be taken to address this serious problem.Comments on the steps proposed in this republication would be helpful solong as they include detailed, substantive support for the positions taken,whether pro or con, or suggest viable alternatives to resolve the problemof postage meter revenue losses. Accordingly, although exempt from the requirements of the AdministrativeProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 (b), (c)) regarding proposed rulemaking by39 U.S.C. 410(a), the Postal Service invites additional public commenton the following proposed amendment of the Domestic Mail Manual, whichis incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations. See 39CFR 111.1. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111 </ITAG>Postal service. <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 111_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
