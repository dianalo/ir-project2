Exxon will gain the stake by acquiring Australia-based Delhi Petroleum Pty. Ltd., a unit of CSR Ltd., an Australian conglomerate. Delhi owns the interest in the field, known as the Cooper-Eromanga area of South Australia and Queensland. Exxon plans to acquire Delhi through its Esso Exploration andamp; Production Australia Inc. unit. Exxon said that under terms of the transaction, CSR and Exxon over the next two years will split equally any earnings derived from any increase in oil prices.    Analysts said the purchase was in line with Exxon's efforts to focus its investments more sharply on its oil and gas businesses. Last year the energy company shed its Exxon Nuclear Corp. unit, its Reliance Electric Co. unit and its stake in its New York headquarters building, and undertook a major restructuring involving the reduction of 6,000 jobs.    The Australian onshore acquisition will immediately give Exxon additional production of 11,250 barrels a day of oil, 30,000 barrels a day of gas liquids and natural gas production of 480 million cubic feet a day. Exxon said that in addition to proved reserves, the offshore area has significant potential for new discovery.    The onshore area is the second-largest oil and gas producing area in Australia after the Bass Strait, in which Exxon's Esso unit also has an interest. Exxon said that several other companies share in the exploration and production interests in the onshore area, but that Delhi and another Australian company, Santos Ltd., have the principal stakes. Exxon said that Delhi operates the exploration and oil production facilities and Santos operates the gas production, processing and transportation facilities. </TEXT></DOC>
