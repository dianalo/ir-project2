Soybean futures led the rally, with a 4 3/4 cent increasein the price of the March contract, which settled at $5.825 abushel. The corn contract for March delivery rose 1 3/4 centsto $2.35 a bushel and the wheat contract for March deliveryrose 1 3/4 cents to $2.66 a bushel.</LP><TEXT>   Some grain futures prices had dropped to new contract lowsFriday and Monday, largely in response to the resignation ofSoviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and threats bythe head of the KGB that a crackdown might be necessary tomaintain order in the country. Traders worried that theseevents might cause the Bush administration to balk atgranting the Soviets credit to buy U.S. grain.   Yesterday, however, traders noted that the KGB hadsoftened its stance and the Soviet Congress had granted PrimeMinister Mikhail Gorbachev new powers, giving an indicationof some stability in the country. &quot;It looked like Gorbachevwas at least still in charge,&quot; said Anne Frick, soybeananalyst for Prudential-Bache in New York. &quot;I think that'sreassuring to the grain markets.&quot;   The Bush administration has pledged to provide as much as$1 billion in credits for food purchases by theshortage-plagued Soviet Union and conceivably might grantmore credits early in the new year. Analysts say any retreatto authoritarian rule in the Soviet Union might persuade theU.S. to change its policy.   Part of yesterday's rally was chalked up to a &quot;technicalcorrection&quot; after dramatic grain sell-offs last week.Following six consecutive sessions of declines for soybeanfutures, the market was due for a rally: &quot;Price drops justdon't go forever with no correction,&quot; Ms. Frick said.   Analysts said grain markets will be choppy and somewhataimless in the next few days, driven partly by continued newsout of the Soviet Union. Trading likely will be light throughthe holiday season and leading up to Jan. 11, the day theU.S. Agriculture Department will release a major crop reportthat will include winter wheat planting figures, a grainsupply and demand report and the government's final cropestimate of the season for soybeans.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum product prices rose inextremely light trading. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,crude oil for February delivery ended at $27.22 a barrel, up$1.30 from Friday. The Merc was closed Monday and Tuesdaybecause of the Christmas holiday. Yesterday's rise waslargely a catch-up response to action Monday on London'sInternational Petroleum Exchange, where Brent crudes roseabout $1 a barrel. Some aggressive war talk in the MiddleEast contributed to yesterday's increase, as did technicalfactors at the close of trading. Traders said heating oilrose sharply, in part because cold weather finally hit theEast Coast. January heating oil finished at 81.26 cents agallon, up 2.32 cents. Gasoline rose in sympathy, with theJanuary contract up 1.90 cents to 68.14 cents a gallon.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. February deliverygold gained $3.10 an ounce to $387.40. March silver advancedseven cents an ounce to $4.1580. April platinum edged up 20cents an ounce to $412.40. Uncertainty in the Persian Gulf,which boosted crude oil prices, continued to create supportfor gold, analysts said. That uncertainty, and light demandfor the metal, is likely to hold February gold at about $380and over, one analyst said.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices advanced, with the Marchcontract rising 2.05 cents a pound to $1.1995. Some tradersbought contracts on reports that a surge of cold weather thathas moved into the Northwest part of the country may movetoward Florida more than a week from now, one analyst said.The analyst added that the concerns were far-fetched, butwere stimulating demand anyway.</TEXT></DOC>
