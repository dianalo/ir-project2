Later Thursday, the 15-member Security Council debated thePanama invasion, with many governments denouncing the UnitedStates. But the council could not decide which government torecognize _ Noriega's or the U.S.-backed government of GuillermoEndara _ and no further meeting was scheduled.   Both sides have sought to have their ambassadors accredited tothe United Nations, which can recognize only one of them.   Eduardo Vallarino, a self-exiled Panamanian businessman, wasnominated as Panama's U.N. ambassador by Endara's government,installed by U.S. troops at a military base Wednesday.   Vallarino told a news conference that Panama's Constitutionprohibits extradition. If Noriega is captured by occupying U.S.forces, he said, Panama would protest his extradition to facenarcotics charges in the United States.   ``I would have to say that probably the Panamanian governmentwould have to protest,'' Vallarino said in answer to a question.   ``If Noriega is apprehended by the authorities in Panama, hewill have to be duly charged and tried in Panama,'' Vallarino said.   But he added that the situation is ``irregular.''   He also said the Endara group had not sought U.S. interventionin Panama, but welcomed it.   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in his first commenton the U.S. intervention, said: ``The position of the U.N. for thelast 45 years is that we always regret the use of force.''   He added that he hoped the Security Council would reachagreement ``to restore order in Panama.''   He spoke before the council reconvened at the request ofNicaragua, which along with the Soviet Union condemned the U.S.invasion Wednesday night.   Nicaragua seeks council condemnation of the U.S. militaryaction, but the United States and Britain could veto any criticalresolution.   Discussion of credentials by the Security Council is rare andhas not occurred in recent memory.   The Noriega government is not represented in the United Nationsbecause the previous envoy, Leonardo Kam, has been promoted toforeign minister. That government is trying to accredit as U.N.envoy its ambassador to the European Community, Mirla Bellavita.   U.N. diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theyexpected the council would not take up the question of competingclaims. They said the council was likely to ask thesecretary-general for a report. The secretary-general, however, hadsaid he hoped the council would decide the question.   The question ultimately could be passed on to the GeneralAssembly, diplomats said. But according to the U.N. Charter, the159-nation assembly cannot take up a question while it is underconsideration by the council, without a request by the council.   The U.N. legal department is studying the question.   The Organization of American States in Washington declined torecognize the Endara government Wednesday.   Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in late 1978 posed a similarproblem for the General Assembly, which refused to recognize theVietnam-installed government and still recocognizes the oustedCambodian government in exile, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanoukand his allies.   Speakers from 10 countries addressed the council Thursday, andall except El Salvador denounced the U.S. invasion, although somealso criticized Noriega.   El Salvador did not specifically endorse the U.S. action, butcriticized Noriega's undermining of democracy andself-determination in Panama.   Peru was especially vocal in condemning ``flagrant violation ofPanama's sovereignty'' in what it called ``a grim updating ofimperialist practices.''   Other speakers included Algeria, Brazil, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finlandand Libya. In the first debate Wednesday night, only Britainstaunchly backed the U.S. action.</TEXT></DOC>
