At least 55.andP;  Five to study the problem space, 16 to work outthe logical formalism of the problem, 10 to create the robotics arm toinstall the light bulb, six in the knowledge-engineering group to study theprocess of changing a light bulb, 13 to write and rewrite the LISP code, andfive in the psychology group to figure out why people want to change lightbulbs in the first place.andM;Funny? Maybe, maybe not.andP;  Humor in the computer field has always been a toughnut to crack.andP;  There's computer humor as seen by outsiders (remember the&quot;computer nerd&quot; books that were popular a few years ago?) and humor aboutoutsiders as seen by insiders.andP;  (How many users does it take to change alight bulb? None, since they were in the dark to begin with and wouldn'trealize the light bulb had gone out.)andM;Though it often diminishes the fun of humor, thinking about a joke'sunderlying message is usually worthwhile.andP;  The Al light bulb joke waspublished in a longer form as a letter from Paul jaredtzky to the editor ofAI Magazine (Aug.andP;  1986).andP;  The joke is mildly funny, but it wouldn't bringdown the house at your average Al group meeting.andM;For those of you old-timers who were involved in the Al field in themid-1980s, you'll recall that the joke indeed had many people rolling in theaisles and, more importantly, had a great deal of merit at the time (less sotoday).andP;  During the early days of Al-commercialization mania, the viewprevailed that every Al project required hordes of specialists.andP;  Things hadgotten a bit out of hand, and the cost and confusion associated with so manyparticipants drove several Al projects into the ground.andM;In some respects, we shouldn't be too harsh on the view espoused at the time.andO;When a field is struggling to identify its areas of interest and thetechniques that can make a difference in a technology project are not exactlyapparent, the tendency is to call in armies of technicians.andP;  The lesson ofthe Al light bulb joke-aside from being a funny poke at ourselves-is areminder of how far from the realities of problem solving many early Alprojects wandered.andP;  Maybe this reminder helped enlighten Al advocates andmoved them towards more level-headed approaches.andM;THE GOOD HUMOR MANandM;I've been collecting computer humor, especially Al-related humor, for manyyears.andP;  During presentations at computer confer ways toss in a joke or two tokeep the audience awake and intrigued.andP;  The beauty of a one-liner orone-panel cartoon is its ability to capture a complex idea or trend the Alfield has experienced.andP;  Whereas you may argue endlessly about how the Alfield has splintered, the simple utterance of the light bulb joke wouldcapture the essence of such a windy argument.andM;I call the jokes &quot;Al icons,&quot; named after the folder and trashcan icons on acomputer screen that represent the concept and action of throwing away anelectronic document.andP;  An icon provides an image that transcends a wordydescription.andP;  It often represents universal images that allow observers theirown similar, but slightly personalized, interpretations.andM;As an example of another Al history lesson, a cartoon appeared in the Mar.andO;1987 Applied Artificial Intelligeizce Reporter depicting two people facingeach other: one was a financier, the other an Al specialist.andP;  The Alspecialist was holding a computer-like box that had a robot arm stretchingout of the side.andP;  The robot hand connected to the arm was quietly reachinginto the pocket of the financier and lifting out a fat wallet.andP;  The captionread something like, &quot;We've run out of Al funding; you'll have to searchsomeplace else.&quot;andM;After the rush of the mid-1980s, many venture capitalists became disenchantedwith the promise and profitability of Al.andP;  Some Al specialists tried newangles to convince the financial community that Al was still viable.andP;  Werethey stealing from the financiers? Or did the financial community suffer fromshortsightedness, not fully realizing the long-term importance of investingin Al companies (thus, we may  justify surreptitious collection of funds fromthe financiers)?andM;We can't really expect a cartoon or joke to answer such deep questions.andO;Humorists may have a particular &quot;answer&quot; they're trying to get across, butmost humor serves more as a debate generator than an answer.andM;JUST FOR LAUGHSandM;One of my favorite sources for humor is a publication that strikes at theheart of scientific endeavors, namely, the journal for IrreproducibleResults.andP;  (Of course, one of the most important aspects of the scientificmethod is the ability to reproduce results for verification of beliefs-thus,the clever satire on the naming of the journal.)andM;One article, &quot;Computer Intelligence: Artificial or Counterfeit?&quot; (Jan.andP;  1986)poked fun at Al by suggesting that we may all be a bit naive to assume humanspossess real intelligence while computers do not.andP;  Using research on humanintelligence, the article equates computer memory (512K, 128K, 8K) withstandard IQ measurements to arrive at an intelligence level for computers,When a computer system crashes, the proper explanation might be that it haswithdrawn from reality and is suffering hallucinations.andP;  (Maybe this explainswhy so many compilers seem temperamental.) The jourtial suggests that perhapswe should measure computers' creativity by their ability to answer questionssuch as, &quot;Programmer, what's this fly doing in my data disk?&quot;andM;Seems pretty silly.andP;  On the other hand, those of us working in Al must facethe difficult questions about the nature of intelligence.andP;  Can we makecomputers as intelligent as humans? Is the Turing Test an appropriatemechanism to determine whether we have succeeded? Can traditional sciencecope with issues such as intuition and insight?andM;Even the newest areas of study in Al have been subjected to the humility ofclowning.andP;  Why did the neural network cross the road? To make a fewconnections on the other side.andP;  What's a neural-network learning law? Learnto commercialize neural networks or go broke.andP;  Can't you see johnny Carsontelling these jokes? (Well, maybe Rodney Dangerfield.)andM;GOOD MEDICINEandM;Humor can be insightful; humor can teach.andP;  Of course, a  oke has to fit theaudience-if you aren't familiar with neural networks, the last two wisecrackswouldn't make any sense at all.andP;  Thus, humor can also be misused, irrelevant,or even mean  notice that I've avoided the seedier side of computer humor).andM;Some computer publications have tried to incorporate humor (regular cartoon,April Fool's special issue, and so on) and found their readers irritated atthe waste of space devoted to such frivolous matters.andP;  I'm not suggestingthat all computer humor is good, but it may be wise to accept some degree ofpointlessness in an effort to find the insightful gem.andP;  Laughter is the bestmedicine, and Al humor is a good lesson for us all.andM;Lance B.
