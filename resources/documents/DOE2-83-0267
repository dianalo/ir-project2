<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-83-0267 </DOCNO><TEXT>The protein secreted by HeLa cells that cross-reacts with antiserum developedagainst the {alpha}-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hasbeen purified approximately 30,000-fold from concentrated culture mediumby organic solvent fractionation followed by ion exchange, gel filtration,and lectin affinity chromatography. The final preparation had a specificactivity (by RIA) of 6.8 x 10{sup 5} ng of {alpha}/mg of protein andappeared homogeneous by electrophoresis on reducing/denaturing polyacrylamidegels (SDS-PAGE). Amino acid analysis indicated that HeLa-{alpha} hada composition very similar to that of the urinary hCG {alpha}-subunit.However, comparison of hCG-{alpha} and HeLa-{alpha} demonstrated thatthe tumor-associated subunit was not identical with its normal counterpart.The purified tumor protein had an apparent molecular weight greater thanthat of the urinary {alpha}-subunit when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and thisdifference was even greater when a partially purified preparation wasexamined by an immunoblot technique (Western). Isoelectric focusing ofthe HeLa and hCG subunits demonstrated that the tumor protein had a lowerpI. Immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis of {alpha}-subunit from HeLacultures labeled with [{sup 3}H]fucose indicated that the tumor subunitwas fucosylated, whereas analysis of hCG-{alpha} hydrosylates by HPLCconfirmed previous reports that the placental subunit does not containfucose. The results indicate that, regardless of whether or not a single{alpha}-subunit gene is being expressed in both normal and neoplastictissues, posttranslational modifications lead to a highly altered subunitin the tumor. The differences observed may be useful in diagnosing neoplasticvs hyperplastic conditions and may lend insight into the mechanism ofectopic hormone production by tumors.</TEXT></DOC>
