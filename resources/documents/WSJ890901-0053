The Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have been feuding over the minimum capital-asset ratio that will be included in the risk-based capital standard now being put in place. While the thrift bailout law sets new capital standards for savings and loans, it also requires that thrifts meet bank capital rules.    The risk-based standard -- which replaces a flat 6% capital minimum -- gears a bank's capital requirement individually to the riskiness of its assets. The FDIC has argued that the minimum capital requirement, even for banks with very low-risk portfolios, should be 6% of assets, while the Comptroller's office earlier this year backed a 3% level.    In recent weeks, officials say, Comptroller Robert Clarke has offered to split the difference and settle for a 4.5% minimum. FDIC officials said yesterday that they received the details of the compromise last week and are checking to see what effect it would have on banks. Most banks already meet the current 6% standard.    &quot;We're looking at it. We haven't ruled anything out,&quot; said Paul Fritts, director of bank supervision at the FDIC.    If the 4.5% minimum capital requirement is adopted, it will almost surely mean that thrifts will have to raise several billion dollars more capital than is required under the 3% tangible capital ratio that thrifts must meet in five years under the bailout law. But it is unclear exactly how much more would be required because the tangible standard and the risk-based minimum measure capital differently.    Thrifts are currently $43 billion short of the 3% tangible level. Of that amount, $28 billion is the deficit in insolvent thrifts that the government will make up. Thus, the industry must raise about $15 billion in new capital, or shrink its assets, to meet the 3% tangible standard. A 4.5% minimum standard would increase even more the amount of capital needed from outside investors.    A spokesman for Mr. Clarke, who is on vacation and couldn't be reached for comment, said that the issue was being negotiated directly by Mr. Clarke, FDIC chairman William Seidman, and Danny Wall, the chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision. The three plan to meet next week. The OTS, the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, is an arm of the Treasury.    Officials at the OTS said the agency is trying to sort out what Congress intended when it passed the bailout bill. In deliberations on the bill, Congress focused intensely on the 3% tangible capital minimum but didn't give much scrutiny to the effect of forcing thrifts to meet bank standards. The OTS could take the position that Congress didn't intend for thrifts to have to meet a tougher standard. </TEXT></DOC>
