The tabloid has sustained tremendous losses since thestrike began Oct. 25, triggering an expected loss for thefourth quarter at the newspaper's parent, Tribune Co.Analysts believe the Daily News ran a loss of nearly $90million in 1990, over half of it because of the strike bynine of the paper's 10 unions.</LP><TEXT>   But the chances of finding a buyer for the nation's oldesttabloid newspaper are slim at best. New York's local economyis mired in a severe advertising slump.   Moreover, shutting the paper also could be costly toTribune Co. Analysts and union officials believe killing theDaily News would cost Tribune Co. nearly $150 million inseverance, pension, and other compensation costs. Daily Newspublisher James Hoge wouldn't estimate the cost of closingthe paper.   Mr. Hoge said all Daily News current employees andstrikers will be notified by letter that the paper may closedown in 60 days, as required by federal law. &quot;It may nevercome to shutting it down, but we have to fulfill ourobligation,&quot; he said.   Daily News executives held out some hope they could winconcessions from the striking unions, letting the paperremain in operation. But Mr. Hoge said the newspaper hassustained &quot;substantial damage to the circulation andadvertising revenue base&quot; and can't continue in its currentstate.   That marked a departure from the newspaper's steadfaststance that it was rebounding from the strike. Daily Newsexecutives had said they were prepared for a long, gradualrebuilding phase. Pre-strike circulation of 1.1 million hadfallen to 600,000 by company estimates and as low as 400,000by union estimates. But management had insisted the paper wasslowly regaining street sales and building home delivery.   On Tuesday, Tribune Co. approved the hiring of investmentbankers Lazard Freres to search for potential buyers. Inrecent months rumored suitors have included Robert Maxwell,the Britain-based media baron, although some observers thinkhe is an unlikely candidate given his own debt problems.   A spokesman for Lazard Freres said the firm has yet totalk with interested parties. &quot;It will be difficult becauseof the labor climate and economic climate,&quot; he said. &quot;We wantto fulfill Tribune's commitment to keep the paperpublishing.&quot;   Wall Street analysts cheered Tribune Co.'s action becauselosses at the New York paper have been a perennial drag onearnings. &quot;The paper was bleeding, they had to do something,and this was a good move,&quot; said Lisa Donneson of CountyNatWest Securities. In composite trading on the New YorkStock Exchange, Tribune Co. shares rose $2.625 to close at$37.25.   But the fate of the Daily News received a more lukewarmreception at Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. The ratings agencyplaced Tribune Co.'s single-A-plus senior debt on CreditWatchbecause of much higher than anticipated costs of the strikeat the Daily News, and because of impact of the decision toclose or sell the struggling paper. About $250 million inoutstanding long-term securities are affected by the listing.</TEXT></DOC>
