<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-81-0810 </DOCNO><TEXT>Magnetic measurements are performed on R/sub 2/Fe/sub 14-x/Cr/sub x/Bcompounds (R = Y, Nd, and Gd). These compounds crystallize in the Nd/sub2/Fe/sub 14/B structure up to x {le} 3. The Curie temperature and thelattice constants a and c decrease with increasing Cr content. The spin-reorientationtemperature in Nd/sub 2/Fe/sub 14/B is lowered when Cr replaces partiallyFe. The influence of Cr atoms on the anisotropy field and the saturationmagnetization is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
