Edward McNamara contends that San Diego authoritiesunconstitutionally denied him the opportunity to raise the girl, whowas conceived during a brief romance with a woman that ended eightmonths before the baby's birth.   McNamara, now 42, did not learn that he had become a father untilafter the infant's birth and the mother sought his consent to putthe child, named Katie, up for adoption.   McNamara sought custody soon after he learned of Katie's birth,but California limits the rights of an unwed father to block anadoption.   Attorney James E. Sutherland argued that California lawunconstitutionally discriminates against unwed fathers by making itmore difficult for them to assert rights as parents.   ``Mr. McNamara's rights shouldn't be terminated except on thesame grounds as the mother's,'' Sutherland told the justices, notingthat a lower court that denied custody had concluded neverthelessthat his client was a loving father of two sons by a previousmarriage.   McNamara, who is now seeking visitation rights, ``was denied anyopportunity to form any relationship with the child'' before she wasput up for adoption by the mother, who is not identified in courtrecords.   But several justices expressed skepticism over McNamara's claimthat he was denied equal protection or denied his rights whenauthorities allowed the natural mother to place Katie up foradoption without McNamara's consent.   ``None of our cases hold that a father in your client's positionhas achieved a protected liberty,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquisttold Sutherland.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor questioned why California didn't haveauthority to adopt a policy ``that the state will consider the bestinterests of the child over the alleged rights of the biologicalfather.''   O'Connor asked Sutherland if McNamara could make the same claimif the child's conception ``had been the result of a so-calledone-night stand.''   ``If he had perfected all the rights manifesting significantparental interest, he would be entitled'' to make the claim,Sutherland replied.   ``That would go significantly beyond the court's cases, wherethere had been an established relationship'' between father andchild, O'Connor said.   Lloyd Harmon Jr., counsel for San Diego County, defendedCalifornia's policy of giving an unwed mother the primary right todecide whether to surrender a child for adoption.   The legal distinction between unwed fathers and unwed mothersfurthers the ``state policy which is the speedy placement ofchildren by putting them in suitable settings so they can nurture,''Harmon argued.   Most unwed fathers are not easily identifiable and ``are notnecessarily interested in fatherhood,'' he said.   ``Biology in and of itself does not not create a substantialrelationship or create a parental right,'' Harmon said. ``There mustbe something substantial between the father and the child.''   The decision to allow Robert and Pamela Moses to adopt Katie was``not an intrusion into an existing family unit. Mr. McNamara andhis daughter were never a family. They never had any relationship.''   ``The most they saw of each other may have been an hour and ahalf some seven years ago,'' Harmon said.   The justices are expected to decide the case by July.   Outside the courtroom, Mrs. Moses, who attended the hearing withher attorney, refused to comment on the case.   McNamara said he feels a ``great loss'' by ``not being able to beher father.''   He said he has pursued the lengthy legal battle because ``it ismy right to raise my daughter and I am not going to give that rightup to anyone.''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   The case is McNamara v.
