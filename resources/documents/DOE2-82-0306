Question concerning the minimal parameter valueE/sub min/ in the rest of the medium under which an instability whichhas emerged in a local area (overheated phase nucleus area) due to ignitionautowave (transition wave) covers the whole medium, is considered. Itis shown that E/sub min/ parameter is much less than E/sub cr/ criticalvalue. In particular, overheating regime in completely ionized plsmawas investigated. At the same time structure (profile) of critical nucleusand autowave rate depending on external homogeneous variable electricfield were condidered.</TEXT></DOC>
