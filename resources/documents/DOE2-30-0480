<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0480 </DOCNO><TEXT>A porous sintered compact, which was obtained by forming and sinteringof fine pure Ni powder with mean particle diameter of 2{mu}m or lessobtained through decarboxylation of nickel carbonyl, is used for an anodeof a molten carbonate fuel cell, but is insufficient from the standpointof creep strength. In this invention, an anode which demonstrates fora long period the same excellent electrode characteristics as the initialelectrode characteristics of the existing Ni anode and has high creepstrength at high temperatures could be obtained by using, as feedstock,the rough particle Ni alloy powder with mean particle diameter of 3-20{mu}mwhich is composed of 0.5-1.0wt% of Al and the rest consisting of Ni andinevitable impurities. In addition, when oxygen of 0.02-1wt% is includedinto the above material of Ni alloy, the anode thus obtained gets itsorganization in which very fine Al oxide particles of 1{mu}m or lessare scattered in the Ni-based alloy and acquires much more excellenthigh temperature creep strength and anti-sintering capability.
