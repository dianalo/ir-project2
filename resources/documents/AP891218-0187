AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.S. lieutenant shot and wounded aPanamanian corporal near an American installation Monday, U.S.officials reported. It was the second shooting incident in threedays between U.S. and Panamanian forces.   On Saturday, Panamanian soldiers shot and killed an Americanofficer near Panamanian military headquarters. President Bush onMonday called that shooting ``an enormous outrage'' and said hewould not rule out military action.   A U.S. Southern Command statement said that on Monday anAmerican was leaving a U.S. Army laundry in the Curundu area ofwestern Panama City when a uniformed Panamanian signaled him tostop and approached him.   The area is near Southern Command headquarters and less than amile from Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters.   The statement said the U.S. officer fired when the Panamanianappeared to reach for a weapon.   ``The American responded defensively by pulling a weapon andfired two shots,'' it said. ``The Panamanian went down, then got upand left the scene. The extent of his injuries is unknown at thistime.''   U.S. officials said the officer was being ``debriefed.''   A Panamanian Defense Forces communique later called it``reckless aggression'' by the U.S. Army.   It said the American ``fired two shots from a firearm, one ofthem hitting the left forearm'' of policeman Cesar Tejada. It saidthe American was traveling in a vehicle that ``never stopped and onthe contrary, accelerated.''   The communique said Tejada was hospitalized, but did not givehis condition.   Capt. Moises Cortizo, Panama's chief of police, said police wereinvestigating.   According to a Command official, the civilian laundry has acontract to clean uniforms for U.S. forces.   In Washington, a Defense Department official, speaking oncondition of anonymity, gave this account:   A Panamanian traffic officer signaled the American to stop andapproached his car. The Panamanian pulled his weapon ``and thelieutenant did the same.''   The American fired two shots and it was believed the Panamanianwas wounded in a leg and an arm.   Tensions still were high at the time because of Saturday'sdeath. Panamanian officials said the U.S. Army commander in Panamathreatened an invasion.   ``This is the most serious incident we have had,'' a Commandspokesman said. ``This involved a loss of life. No course of actionis being ruled out as a response.''   ``We are trying to be rational in our response. We are going totake a calculated plan of action. The U.S. government does notrespond without thinking results through.''   He spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Photographs of the 1981 Chevrolet with Michigan plates in whichthe Americans were riding showed bullet holes, including two on thedriver's side and one through the trunk.   U.S. officers said the shots came from Soviet-made AK rifles.   The United States has taken no visible action since Saturdayother than to put its forces on maximum alert and display themvisibly in its military installations.   The Pentagon said the officer was fatally shot and a Navyofficer and his wife were arrested and beaten Saturday night notfar from the military headquarters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,the Panamanian leader.   Panamanian Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon Garcia on Monday called``completely false'' allegations that the couple were mistreated,though he confirmed they were arrested.   U.S. troops in battle gear patrolled perimeter fences at theirbases Monday and Panamanian troops blocked the street in front ofthe military headquarters, but life was normal in the rest of thecity.   U.S. and Panamanian forces were holding a ``dialogue'' bymessenger, Castrejon told reporters. He said the U.S. Army Southcommander, Gen. Marc Cisneros, had threatened an invasion.   Asked why the United States had not already invaded, Castrejonsaid, ``It could be they realize they went through the checkpoint.''   A spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command, which controls allU.S. forces in Panama, including U.S. Army South, said he could notcomment on Castrejon's statements.   The Associated Press learned Panama's Defense Forces sent aletter to U.S. military officials apparently trying to gain timefollowing the U.S. demand for an explanation.   The Panamanian military said the letter ``demanded that U.S.forces exercise maximum prudence to avoid unfortunate incidents.''   It said U.S. forces ``disregarded our observations resulting inunfortunate incidents as the one which occurred on the evening ofDec. 16.''   A U.S. military source said there had been no ``negotiations''with the Panamanians concerning the incident.   The United States said Panamanian troops were solely responsiblefor the violence Saturday, that the U.S. officer and threecompanions took a wrong turn and were lost.   The Defense Forces accused U.S. officers of provocation and saidthey ran through a Defense Forces checkpoint.   In Washington, the White House said the violence was a``consequence'' of Panama's being run by Noriega.   Since February 1988, when Noriega was indicted in Florida onnarcotics charges, the United States has tried to drive him frompower with economic, diplomatic and political pressure.   Noriega denies the charges. He claims Washington wants to renegeon treaties under which the United States is to transfer control ofthe canal to Panama at the end of the century and close U.S.military installations.   Thousands of U.S. soldiers lived in Panama City until earlierthis year, when they and their dependents were ordered to move ontothe bases. Many dependents returned to the United States.   The Command confirmed that the transfer of civilian dependentsfrom military posts ``was being stepped up.''   The number of families still on post is 500, down from 3,200last May.</TEXT></DOC>
