(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Airline pilots told investigators they hadbecome confused while taxiing in the same runway area where twoNorthwest Airlines jets collided in heavy fog this week, killingeight people.   The unidentified pilots, not involved in the fatal collision,volunteered the information in interviews with the NationalTransportation Safety Board team looking into Monday's crash, headinvestigator John Lauber said Thursday.   Previous confusion among pilots at Detroit Metropolitan Airportwas reported ``and not necessarily under low visibilityconditions,'' Lauber said at a news conference held before most ofthe team left Detroit.   Investigators used a DC-9 jet Thursday to reconstruct the errantpath taken by a Northwest DC-9 through heavy fog onto runway 3-C,where a Northwest Boeing 727 was thundering toward takeoff forMemphis, Tenn.   Lauber said reconstructing the events leading up to the crashhelped investigators document what the cockpit crew may have seen,including ``all taxiway markings, runway markings, the lights, thesigns.''   Eight people were killed and 20 were injured when thePittsburgh-bound DC-9, carrying 39 passengers and four crewmembers, apparently made two wrong turns and ended up in the pathof the other jet.   The 145 passengers and eight crew aboard the Boeing 727 jetescaped injury.   Investigators have said poor visibility, inadequate runwaylighting and pilot and control-tower error could have contributedto the crash.   ``We wouldn't, at this stage, rule out anything,'' Lauber said.   About 70 NTSB workers have been conducting interviews andinvestigations. Remaining investigators hoped to finish field workover the weekend.   ``We've gotten to the point where the factual part of this isstarting to wind down. Now it's all analyzing the data,'' agencyspokesman Brent Bahler said.   A final report could take as long as a year to complete.   On Wednesday, Milio Rinna, 60, of Allen Park, a passenger on theDC-9, filed a lawsuit against Northwest in Wayne County CircuitCourt, the first suit filed against the airline after Monday'scrash.   Rinna, a health and safety official with the United Steelworkersunion, suffered burns and other injuries after using his bare handsto extinguish flames on another passenger, said his lawyer, WilliamL. Martens of Southfield.   Martens and Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said Rinna's suitprobably would be the first of many.   ``It seems inconceivable to me, given the number who wereinjured and the number of deaths, that there will not be otherlawsuits,'' Martens said.   Gibbons agreed, but declined further comment on legal action.   Five passengers remained hospitalized today, listed inconditions ranging from good to serious.</TEXT></DOC>
