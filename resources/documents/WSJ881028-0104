But what's the best thing she expects to be able to say about a Bush presidency at the end of his term in 1992?    &quot;It's over. You can vote again for somebody else.&quot;    The 58-year-old computer systems analyst reflects an attitude of disappointment widely held in the nation 10 days before the presidential election. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll gives Vice President Bush a 51% to 42% lead over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis -- a sharp drop from the huge lead of 17 percentage points Mr. Bush enjoyed immediately after the second presidential debate two weeks ago, but still a substantial edge.    Yet the poll also confirms what many voters and analysts recently have been suspecting: The electorate, even by its own blase approach to recent elections, is bitterly unhappy with this campaign and its candidates. In the survey, conducted earlier this week, 56% of the likely voters believe Mr. Bush is running a negative campaign, while only 36% believe he is running a positive one. A similarly large percentage believe Mr. Dukakis's campaign is negative. More than six in 10 likely voters are dissatisfied with the choice between the two candidates and wish they had different people in the race. Only two months, ago, they approved of the choice by almost the same proportion.    Neither the poll nor discussions with voters in this Democratic-held congressional district suggest Mr. Bush has coattails that will significantly help other Republicans. Despite Mr. Bush's big lead, more voters in the nationwide poll say they plan to vote Democratic than Republican in congressional races. And, by a wide 22 percentage points, voters said they prefer to have Congress and the presidency controlled by different parties.    To explore the sentiments behind the statistics, The Wall Street Journal asked pollster Peter Hart to bring together 12 &quot;swing voters&quot; from Rock Island and adjacent Moline this week to discuss the campaign. The group is too small to be a scientific sample; still, their attitudes help explain the results of the Journal/NBC survey.    Mrs. Schilling and the other panelists are exactly the kind of voters wooed assiduously by both candidates this year: independents, Democrats who voted for President Reagan four years ago, and undecided and weakly committed voters of both parties. Their feelings are remarkably uniform. At one point, pollster Hart -- who conducted the discussion for the Journal -- asks for a show of hands on whether people are generally pleased with the selection of candidates. Not a single person is happy with the choice, and no one feels the candidates are up to the job.    Mr. Bush has the edge with some of these voters, but only because his tenure as vice president makes him more of a known quantity, and therefore less of a risk. These people don't seek to hand him and the Republicans a broad mandate. Cheryl Michel, a Democrat who voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984, complains that Mr. Bush isn't &quot;strong and decisive on his own.&quot; But the 34-year-old secretary says she reluctantly plans to vote for him anyway. &quot;Sometimes you feel safer going with the known.&quot;    Illinois is a major battleground in the campaign. Polls of voters in the state, which previously showed Mr. Bush trailing Mr. Dukakis, now have him ahead by a narrow margin. Rock Island is exactly the kind of area Mr. Dukakis must carry. In 1984, the 17th congressional district gave Ronald Reagan 54% of its votes. Today, though, the area has a smaller population, unemployment remains stubbornly high at 8%, and shuttered businesses and &quot;For Sale&quot; signs stand in stark contrast to GOP claims of national prosperity. &quot;Dukakis needed to turn these voters on,&quot; says Mr. Hart, a democrat who isn't working for any candidate. Instead, &quot;what we heard was people turned off to both candidates.&quot;    &quot;I'm disappointed because I wanted to vote against Mr. Bush and I can't,&quot; laments Mrs. Schilling. &quot;Reagan has been a strong leader, and it's disappointing to see these two candidates now. Neither one is the picture of strong leadership.&quot;    Despite the GOP's advantage in the race for the presidency, there isn't any sign here of difficulty for liberal Democratic Rep. Lane Evans. Rep. Evans, who pulled more votes in his 1984 re-election race than the president did in the district, is widely expected to win his race handily this year. Mr. Hart suggests that one reason there isn't any Republican groundswell at the moment is that Mr. Bush is running against Mr. Dukakis &quot;in personal rather than policy terms. Unlike 1980, where we heard cries for sweeping changes, this year there are no issues for other Republicans to cling to.&quot;    Indeed, members of the group say they lack a clear sense of where either Mr. Bush or Mr. Dukakis would lead the country, or what their presidencies would be like. &quot;The longer this campaign has gone along, the less clear it's become to me,&quot; says John DeDoncker, 24, an attorney, Democrat and likely Dukakis voter. &quot;I'm more muddled now,&quot; agrees John Sherwin, a 59-year-old teacher and Reagan Democrat who plans to vote for Mr. Bush.    The nationwide Journal/NBC poll finds a sense of skepticism -- even cynicism -- among the electorate at large. For example, Mr. Bush has made his promise of &quot;no new taxes&quot; a central theme of his campaign. Yet the poll finds only 21% of likely voters believe him; 71% say he might accept higher taxes despite his promise.    The survey also shows there are few expectations about a Bush presidency. Seven in 10 likely voters say that, from what they have seen in the campaign thus far, they don't think the vice president has &quot;a lot of new ideas to solve the nation's problems.&quot; (Half of likely voters don't think Mr. Dukakis has many new ideas, either.)    The poll found that a majority want a change in direction from the path of Ronald Reagan's policies, and nearly eight in 10 likely voters believe Mr. Bush will &quot;keep things going pretty much as they are now.&quot; The poll, however, shows he is winning not only a vast majority of voters who want no change, but also a chunk of those who do.    If some of the numbers aren't flattering for George Bush, they are devastating for Michael Dukakis. Forty-nine percent of likely voters have an unfavorable opinion of him, while 38% have a favorable opinion -- an ominous finding. By contrast, Mr. Bush is viewed favorably by 51%, unfavorably by 38%.    The poll shows Mr. Bush leading among every age group, as well as in every region of the country. He is ahead by five points in the Midwest, nine in the West, 10 in the East and 15 in the South. Moreover, the poll shows him capturing 20% of black votes, an extremely high level for a Republican.    Mr. Bush's attacks on the Democratic nominee have had a major impact. By wide margins, likely voters say that what they have learned about Mr. Dukakis's views on crime and defense in the campaign makes them less likely to vote for him.    To get a specific picture of swing voter attitudes nationally, The Wall Street Journal examined their feelings in the survey. The group included Reagan Democrats who still approve of the president's performance, independents and undecided Democrats and Republicans. These people make up a little over one in five likely voters.    If there is to be any partywide triumph for Republican congressional candidates this year, the GOP will have to attract many of these voters. Yet there is even less evidence of a GOP groundswell here than among the general electorate. By nearly 3 to 1, swing voters would rather have Congress and the presidency controlled by different parties. More plan to vote Democratic for Congress than Republican, and by a wider margin than other voters.    Dissatisfaction with the presidential race is even higher among these voters -- 71% -- than it is with the rest of the electorate. One in three says his vote is based more on dislike of the other ticket than approval of the one he supports. And unfavorable opinions about Mr. Dukakis outweigh favorable ones by 47% to 29%.    Many of these sentiments are evident in the Rock Island discussion group. While neither candidate has defined himself adequately to these voters, Mr. Bush's attacks have succeeded in defining Mr. Dukakis. Bill Sowards, a 37-year-old police sergeant and Reagan Democrat, is especially troubled by what he has learned from the Bush campaign about Mr. Dukakis's views on crime.    &quot;Dukakis is a very, very liberal person, releasing murderers, letting them out on parole,&quot; he says, citing the vice president's ads about Massachusetts' prisoner furlough program. &quot;Just from watching TV and reading the papers, I think Dukakis is in favor of a liberalized penal system. I think Bush is stricter.&quot;    Even some of those who should be among Mr. Dukakis's staunchest supporters express reservations. &quot;Dukakis really doesn't impress me that much,&quot; says Kris Vyncke, a 33-year-old engineering technician laid off from his job at the local John Deere plant. He will probably vote for the Democratic nominee, but not with any real enthusiasm.    But Betty Quist, 59, a widowed tavern owner, is one Reagan Democrat who will be enthusiastically back in the Democratic fold this time. &quot;Bush is running completely on Reagan, and I don't think he's a man on his own,&quot; she says. And even Marrietta Castle, a 44-year-old college professor and Reagan Republican who is leaning toward voting for Mr. Bush, asks plaintively, &quot;Will the real George Bush please stand up? I hope I won't find out when he's elected what he really stands for.&quot;    For many of these people, Mr. Bush's appeal lies in his experience. Gigi Plunkett, an undecided 40-year-old Moline housewife and Reagan independent, says, &quot;The man has the kind of experience I'd want if I were hiring a president.&quot; Mr. Sowards, the policeman, says that voters &quot;are going to say Reagan didn't do that bad of a job, so I'm going to go with a known quantity.&quot;    Yet their frustrations about the campaign repeatedly surface. Cheryl Michel, the Reagan Democrat, sums up the feeling when she says the most she expects at the end of a Bush administration is that &quot;things haven't gotten any worse but they haven't gotten any better.&quot;    ---   Georgette Jasen in New York contributed to this article.    ---   In general, do you think (candidate) is running a positive or a negative campaign?
