The investors alleged that Sullivan andamp; Cromwellfraudulently concealed that the New York Stock Exchange wasinvestigating investments they purchased fromPrudential-Bache Securities Inc., the law firm's client. Theinvestors claimed the information would have helped them inlitigation against Prudential-Bache, the Prudential InsuranceCo. of America unit now called Prudential Securities Inc.                                                                                                          Bernard W. Nussbaum, a New York attorney for Sullivan andamp;Cromwell, called the decision by Judge Robert W. Sweet &quot;anacross-the-board victory.&quot;   Michael A. Cooper, a litigation partner at Sullivan andamp;Cromwell, said the law firm was &quot;gratified&quot; that the fourrelated suits had been dismissed. From the start, Sullivan andamp;Cromwell had &quot;vigorously&quot; denied the allegations, Mr. Coopersaid.   The litigation stems from a 1983 dispute between theinvestors and Prudential-Bache, in which the plaintiffsclaimed the company had made misleading statements in itsmarketing of Ginnie Mae and treasury bond futures contracts.   That case was settled in 1985 for an amount that wasn'tdisclosed, but the investors sued Sullivan andamp; Cromwell andPrudential-Bache arguing that they would have demanded moremoney in that 1985 settlement had they known about the BigBoard investigation. Prudential-Bache later agreed to pay aBig Board fine for not disclosing certain investment risks.   In the decision yesterday, Judge Sweet said he wasconvinced that the investors' original lawyer, Edward Swan,&quot;had adequate knowledge and opportunity to uncover anywrongdoing on {Sullivan andamp; Cromwell's} part.&quot; Therefore, thejudge said, this subsequent lawsuit was inappropriate. Mr.Swan couldn't be reached for comment.   Richard B. Cooper, a lawyer for one group of investors,said he was reviewing the judge's ruling and hadn't decidedwhether to appeal. A lawyer for another group of plaintiffscouldn't be reached.   Earlier this year Sullivan andamp; Cromwell was vindicated inanother high-profile dispute, when the Securities andExchange Commission decided not to sanction George Kern Jr.,a prominent takeover partner. The SEC's enforcement divisionhad brought administrative charges against Mr. Kern inconnection with his 1986 representation of Allied StoresCorp. in its defense of a hostile bid by Campeau Corp. TheSEC charged that Mr. Kern induced his client to delaydisclosing material takeover information.   Sullivan andamp; Cromwell has also apparently resolved two otherdisputes. Disciplinary charges brought against trust andestates partner Garrard R. Beeney, allegedly for improperlyobtaining files from another law firm, have been dropped, aSullivan andamp; Cromwell spokesman said.   The law firm also had been accused of bribing and bullyingwitnesses in a bitter will contest between heirs to theJohnson andamp; Johnson fortune. State disciplinary charges againstDonald C. Christ, one of the partners involved, have beendropped, the spokesman said. Proceedings against anotherpartner involved, Robert M. Osgood, haven't concluded, thespokesman added.   The three partners couldn't be reached for comment.   Hal Lieberman, the chief counsel of a state Supreme Courtdisciplinary committee, declined to comment on theproceedings.   ---   LAWYERS IN GIANT ASBESTOS case ask judge not to barcertain witnesses.   The lawyers represent 35,000 public and private schoolsthat have filed a class-action suit seeking reimbursement forthe costs of testing and removing asbestos from the schoolbuildings, as well as punitive damages against 36 asbestosmanufacturers, including Pfizer Inc., GAF Corp., and W.R.Grace andamp; Co.   They have asked Judge James Kelly of Philadelphia toreconsider his decision to bar any testimony by scientistswho participated in a June 1990 conference on asbestosdisease sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences and theCollegium Ramazzini, a scientific association.   Judge Kelly's ruling came in response to a request by 12asbestos manufacturers that he disqualify himself fromhearing the case because he attended the conference, whichwas funded in part by the plaintiffs' lawyers with money fromearly settlements in the litigation.   The judge has refused to disqualify himself, but said hisdecision to bar the witnesses was an effort to eliminate anyappearance of bias in favor of the plaintiffs.   In documents filed with the court, the plaintiffs' lawyersargue that as many as 13 of 17 scientists expected to testifyas expert witnesses would now be excluded from appearing atthe trial. They said that the judge's decision in effectdestroyed their case because the witnesses are crucial andcan't be replaced.   David Berger of Philadelphia, co-lead counsel for theplaintiffs, said &quot;the papers speak for themselves&quot; anddeclined to comment further.   Denis McInerney, a New York attorney for Grace, said JudgeKelly had acted properly by &quot;being very careful to avoid eventhe appearance of evil&quot; and that the companies would opposethe plaintiffs' lawyers' motion.   The Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative publicinterest law group, said it was filing papers on the issue.In a judicial misconduct complaint, the group said JudgeKelly violated ethics rules by failing to disqualify himself.Paul D. Kamenar, executive legal director of the foundation,said the group's action was independent of the defenselawyers' motion.   A spokeswoman for the judge said he doesn't comment onpending cases.   ---   PREGNANT WOMAN can't be prosecuted for transmitting crackto baby.   The Michigan Supreme Court has refused to hear an appealin a case involving Kimberly Hardy, a 24-year-old woman whoadmitted to using crack cocaine 13 hours before giving birth.By refusing to consider the case, the Supreme Court let standan April decision by the Michigan Court of Appeals dismissingthe drug-delivery charges against Ms. Hardy.   The high court ruling effectively blocks futuredrug-trafficking charges against pregnant women in Michiganfor transmitting crack to their babies.   The Court of Appeals had ruled that Michigan's Legislaturenever intended the drug-trafficking law to apply to pregnantwomen who transmit drugs to their fetus in utero or to theirnewborns through the umbilical cord immediately after birth.   &quot;This is not a binding precedent for other states, but itmay be influential,&quot; said Howard Simon, executive director ofthe Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union,which provided Ms. Hardy's attorneys. &quot;It does put an end tothis excessive tactic in the war on drugs in Michigan.&quot;   More than 60 women nationwide have been charged with drugtrafficking, child abuse or neglect for taking illegal drugsduring their pregnancy, according to the ACLU. Appeals courtshave upheld only one conviction, a 15-year probation forJennifer Johnson of Florida, who was found guilty ofdelivering drugs to her baby. The case has been appealed andis pending before the state Supreme Court.   Tony Tague, the prosecutor in the Michigan case, said hewill lobby the state Legislature to pass a law permittingdrugtrafficking prosecutions of pregnant women who transmitdrugs to their babies.   &quot;We view the Supreme Court's decision as a step backwardsin our efforts to keep children drug-free,&quot; he said.   ---   PRIVATE SOCIAL CLUB can keep membership list secret   The Pacific-Union Club, an exclusive, all-maleorganization in San Francisco, doesn't have to disclose itsmembership list to California's Franchise Tax Board, thestate Court of Appeals ruled. The tax board had planned touse the list to conduct random audits of club members tocheck for illegal tax deductions.   The Court of Appeals ruled that the Pacific-Union Club'smembership list is protected under the First and Fourteenthamendments, which guarantee the privacy of personalassociation.   &quot;This is the first time that any appellate court hassquarely held that privacy rights do apply to private socialclubs,&quot; said Bill Edlund, the club's attorney. &quot;Thegovernment can't intrude unless there is a very compellingstate interest at stake.&quot;   The Franchise Tax Board will appeal the case to the stateSupreme Court, arguing that obtaining membership lists ofclubs is the least intrusive way to enforce California law,which prohibits members of discriminatory privateorganizations from claiming club-related business expenses astax deductions, said state Controller Gray Davis.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
