JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Researchers said today the atmosphere over theArctic region ``is primed for a very large destruction of ozone''but a six-week study did not uncover a vast ozone ``hole'' as hadbeen found over the South Pole.   Scientists who led the recently concluded international researcheffort into Arctic ozone depletion said there are clear chemicalsigns that significant ozone destruction could occur over the Arcticregion, possibly within the next few weeks.   However, ``there is no large ozone hole in the Arctic,'' Dr.Robert Watson, a National Aeronautics and Space Administrationscientists and one of the research project leaders, told a newsconference.   A Canadian scientist recently suggested in a study that an ozonehole may be developing over the Arctic because of atmosphericpollution. Watson said the latest research could not make thatconclusion.   But he and Dr. Adrian Tuck, another project scientist, said theresearch effort found ``strong evidence'' of an abundance ofchemically active chlorine compounds and other conditions in theArctic region that are key to the destruction of the ozone layer.   An international team of scientists began the research effort inearly January and concluded it recently.   Scientists are concerned about the destruction of ozone in thestratosphere because it provides a protective layer againstultraviolet rays of the sun. Overexposure to such rays has beenlinked to skin cancer. Watson said it has been estimated that a 1percent depletion of ozone causes a 2 percent increase inultraviolet radiation.   A primary cause of ozone depletion is the release ofchlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, into the stratosphere. Aninternational treaty has called for the reduction of CFCs _ used asa refrigerant and as a foam-blowing agent _ by 50 percent over thenext decade because of its harm to the ozone layer.   The Arctic research effort, which involved scientists from theUnited States, Britain and Norway, began Jan. 1 from a base inStavanger, Norway. It included 28 flights over the Arctic regionaboard an instrument-laden DC-8 and a high-altitude ER-2surveillance aircraft to gather data.   The researchers focused on a large ``vortex'' of westerly windsover the Arctic region. They reported finding the stratosphere 12 ormore miles above the Arctic ``highly perturbed'' because of chemicalreactions, including the presence of high levels of man-made,ozone-depleting chlorine oxide gasses.   Furthermore, said the scientists, they confirmed an abundance ofhigh-level clouds formed by tiny particles of ice. These so-called``polar stratospheric clouds'' intensify the chemical reaction thatdestroys ozone because they provide a surface chlorine molecules.   The researchers said the six-week study found no direct evidenceof Arctic ozone loss, but they concluded that ``a considerableportion of the vortex air was primed for zone destruction'' and ifthe amount of sunlight increases ozone could be destroyed ``at asignificant rate'' possibly as much as 1 percent a day while theconditions exist.   But they said the research provided no solid evidence as to howmuch ozone destruction might occur over the Arctic. Scientistspreviously have estimated that based on data collected from baloonsabout 6 percent of the Arctic ozone may have been destroyed sincel970.   The scientists said the degree of actual Arctic ozone destructionin the future will depend on a variety of factors, including futureweather conditions, amount of sunlight and how long the windpatterns remain in place.   Nevertheless, said Tuck, ``the atmosphere (over the Arctic) isprimed for a very large destruction of ozone'' although scientistsdo not foresee the degree of ozone destruction over the North Poleas has been found over the Antarctic.   ``We're not dealing with a 50 percent (ozone) loss situationhere,'' said Tuck, a scientist for the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration.</TEXT></DOC>
