<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-53-1201 </DOCNO><TEXT>In CFCl{sub 3} matrices the cation-radicals of methyl and ethyl formates,formed in {gamma}-irradiated solutions, at 77 K efficiently undergo intramolecularH atom transfer to form the secondary cation-radicals HC(OH)OCH{sub 2}CH{sub2} and DC(OH)OCD{sub 2}CH{sub 2}. This process does not occur in thedeuteroformate cation-radical DCOOCH{sub 2}CD{sub 3}/sup +./, which isobserved in the ESR spectra in different conformations, depending onthe temperature. Ion-molecule reactions involving cation-radicals areindicated.</TEXT></DOC>
