The idea that is at stake forthe DWK and the Bavarian government is to show that the waste resultingfrom nuclear power plant operation can be disposed of, and this is tobe demonstrated in order to get the permits for further operation ofexisting power plants, and for installing new reactors. The legal problemsof the reprocessing project at Wackersdorf have been tackled swiftlyby accelerating the licensing procedure by means of amendments of lawsand by a strategy that criminalizes and suppresses any resistance againstthe Wackersdorf project on the part of the citizens. The author's conclusionafter reviewing the current situation is that the Bavarian governmentis prepared to abandon constitutional principles in order to enforceits own plans. (HSCH).</TEXT></DOC>
