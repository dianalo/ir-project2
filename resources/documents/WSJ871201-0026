The AMR Corp. unit said it &quot;will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the continued operation of its entire schedule&quot; in the event of a strike.    The board of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants is asking the union's 12,000 members to give it authority to call a strike, saying negotiations haven't progressed since American unilaterally imposed a new contract June 1. The strike vote will be counted on or about Dec. 20.    American said it &quot;is confident that the vast majority of its flight attendants do not support the strike talk and would choose to remain on the job.&quot; American also said it believes a strike would be illegal. However, a spokesman for the National Mediation Board in Washington, D.C., said, &quot;We cannot interpret the legality of this contemplated action of the flight attendants. That issue can only be resolved in the courts.&quot;    The union has said it doesn't think American can train enough replacements to maintain a full schedule during the busy holiday season if there is a walkout.    Separately, American said it set a new daily traffic record Sunday because of brisk Thanksgiving holiday traffic, flying 210.6 million revenue passenger miles, with 81.7% of its seats filled. That eclipsed the old daily record of 207.2 million revenue passenger miles set July 2. A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile. </TEXT></DOC>
