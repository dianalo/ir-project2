The Commerce Department said Thursday that the current economicexpansion is the first in 28 years in which regional differences inincomes have grown larger rather than narrowing.   The department said all 10 of the states with the highestaverage personal incomes last year were on the nation's coasts:eight along the Atlantic and two, California and Alaska, on thePacific.   Connecticut ranked No. 1 with residents earning $21,266 forevery man, woman and child last year, an increase of 8.8 percentover 1986.   For the entire nation, incomes rose 6 percent to an average of$15,481 last year, the best showing since a similar 6 percentincrease in 1985. Incomes had risen 5.1 percent in 1986.   The gain last year kept Americans ahead of inflation, whichclimbed 4.4 percent.   Seven of the 10 states with the lowest incomes were in theSouth. Mississippi remained in last place with a per capita incomeof $10,292, an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year.   In contrast to most recovery periods, regional economicdifferences have widened since the 1981-82 recession, the reportsaid.   The Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions were farther behind thenational income average in 1987 than they were in 1982 at thedepths of the recession, while New England and the Mid-Atlanticregions were farther ahead.   ``This has been a somewhat unusual economic expansion,'' saidRudolph DePass, a Commerce Department analyst. ``Regions like NewEngland have benefited from rapid growth in high-tech industriesand relatively slow increases in population, while the Southwestand Rocky Mountain states have been hit by a slump in the oilindustry.''   New England was the top-earning region in 1982, with incomes 9percent above the national average. It increased that lead lastyear with incomes 20 percent above the national average. TheMid-Atlantic region, which had incomes 10 percent above thenational average in 1982, had incomes 14 percent higher last year.And the West had incomes 11 percent higher than the nationalaverage last year, compared with 12 percent higher in 1982.   By contrast, the Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions saw theirincomes fall to 12 percent below the national average in 1987,compared with 4 percent or less in 1982.   This drop put these two regions close to the Southeast, whichstill came in last with incomes 13 percent below the nationalaverage. The Southeast had been 14 percent below in 1982.   The Great Lakes region was unchanged, with incomes still 2percent below the national average in 1987.   The new figures are likely to supply ammunition for Democraticcharges that the Reagan economic program, while benefiting somesectors of the economy, have left other areas far behind.   The Democrats charge that the country has been turned into a``bicoastal economy'' divided between healthy sections on bothcoasts and a problem-plagued heartland afflicted by hard times inagriculture, oil and declining smokestack industries.   New Jersey, with an average income of $20,352, ranked secondbehind Connecticut. Massachusetts was No. 3, with an average incomeof $19,142, followed by Alaska, $18,230, and Maryland, $18,124.Rounding out the top 10 were New York, California, New Hampshire,Delaware and Virginia.   In addition to Mississippi, states with the lowest incomes wereWest Virginia, with an average of $11,020; followed by Utah,Louisiana, Arkansas, Idaho, New Mexico, Alabama, South Carolina andKentucky.   Thursday's report was based on revised figures that showedincomes overall grew at a stronger pace than estimated when theoriginal report was released in April.   At that time, the government said national per capita incomesrose 4.8 percent, barely ahead of the 4.4 percent rise in consumerprices last year.</TEXT></DOC>
