The Census Bureau on Thursday released its 1988 populationestimates, showing that the West and parts of the South continuedstrong population growth, while smaller growth rates were reflectedin the Northeast.   The Midwest appeared to be rebounding after a dropoff inpopulation during the early part of the decade.   The total U.S. population stood at 245.8 million as of July 1,the date of the 1988 Census statistics, reflecting a 3 percentincrease in population from July 1, 1985.   Over the three-year period, the biggest growth rate andpopulation loss were seen in small population states: Nevada was up12.8 percent, topping the 1 million mark for the first time; and theenergy-producing state of Wyoming had a 7.6 percent decline, a lossof 39,000 people, leaving its population at 471,000.   The 12 Midwestern states _ where the depressed farm economycaused a population downturn between 1981 and 1983 _ had an overall1.2 percent population increase in the 1985-88 period, the Censusestimates showed.   Some Midwestern states continued to lose residents, but theMidwest as a region picked up slightly.   Losses were estimated in 1985-1988 for Iowa, Nebraska, NorthDakota, Montana and Idaho, the Census Bureau said in a statement,but added, ``The 1988 data indicate that the declines may beslowing, and several of these states may have grown in the pastyear.''   The largest state, California, had the greatest increase inpopulation, 1.8 million people, or 6.9 percent, boosting its totalto 28.2 million.   Other states that showed strong growth rates over the three yearswere: Arizona, 9.6 percent, bringing its total to 3.5 millionpeople; New Hampshire, 9.9 percent, to 1.1 million residents;Florida, 8.9 percent, to 12.4 million people; Georgia, 7.1 percent,to 6.4 million; Maryland, 5.7 percent, to 4.6 million; and Delaware,5.4 percent, to 660,000 people.   Eleven states and the District of Columbia lost population duringthe three years: Iowa, North Dakota, Nebraska, West Virginia,Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and Alaska.   In the regions outside the Midwest, the government found thatpopulation increased by 1.5 percent in the Northeast, including theNew England and Mid-Atlantic states; by 3.7 percent in the South;and by 5.5 percent in the West, including the Mountain and PacificCoast states.   Florida, the Sunshine State, continued to attract residents, witha population growth rate of 8.9 percent. That boosted its populationto 12.4 million.</TEXT></DOC>
