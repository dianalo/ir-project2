Not a typical invocation from a man of the cloth, but seriousbusiness for those who control much of America's pursestrings andface the uncertainty of a new president in the aftermath of BlackMonday.   ``It's been a wild and wooly year,'' recalled Charles Pistor,outgoing president of the giant American Bankers Association whoseterm began on Black Monday. ``Despite the stock market drop ... wedid make progress in 1988. But there are some things we have notseen this year.''   A perennial concern is banking reform legislation. However, thatseems likely to be overshadowed in the coming year by the mountingproblems of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Co., whichinsures the nation's 3,200 thifts.   ``The issue of FSLIC will be more overriding than bankingreform,'' Pistor, chairman of Northpark National Bank of Dallas,told reporters at the 114th annual ABA convention in Honolulu thispast week. ``Congress must deal early on with the problem.''   At stake is about a quarter of the federally insured Sandamp;Ls, whichare considered at or near insolvency. Estimates for liquidating orbailing them out have ranged from $45 billion to $100 billion, fartoo costly for the financially strapped FSLIC.   Bankers worry that the problem may spill over to them sinceCongress could consider merging the financially strapped FSLIC withthe healthier Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures thenation's 14,000 commercial banks and some thrifts.   A merger of the two insurance funds, which both insureindividual's deposits of up to $100,000, has long been opposed bybankers and the FDIC itself. For one thing, they fear a mergerwould drive up the cost of bank insurance premiums, which run about2{ percentage points below what thrifts pay.   Bankers also worry that tapping into the FDIC may aggravatebanks' own failure problem. The FDIC says a record number of bankswill fail this year _ as many as 250, compared with a record 184last year and 19 others that needed federal assistance.   Still, Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke warnedbankers at their four-day convention that an FSLIC-FDIC is adistinct possibility, and that the industry should take a moreactive role in dealing with the thrift problem or risk being ``aprisoner of events.''   ``Merging the FDIC insurance fund with the thrift insurance fundhas a political attractivess that cannot be ignored,'' Clarkeinsisted. ``Certainly, there isn't enough money in the FDIC tosolve the problem. But the fund is enough to serve as a significantdown payment and it is available.   ``Like all the other independent agencies in our government, theFDIC is a creature of Congress. And what Congress gives, Congresscan take away.''   In an emotional rejoinder, though, FDIC Chairman L. WilliamSeidman promised to defend the fund and ``prevent the problems ofthe Sandamp;Ls from being billed to banks.''   He said the FDIC plans to complete a study after Election Daythat began about eight months ago on possible solutions for thethrift crisis.   The ABA also has promised to conduct its own studies.   ``This is a complicated issue. We don't know with certainty howbig this problem is,'' said newly elected ABA President Thomas R.Rideout, vice chairman of First Union National Bank of NorthCarolina. ``Debate is just beginning. I think ABA has been early onin shaping public policy.''   The ABA also promises to keep its hand in shaping banking reformlegislation before the next Congress.   A turf battle between House Banking Committee Chairman FernandJ. St Germain, D-R.I., and House Energy and Commerce CommitteeChairman John Dingell, D-Mich., quashed a measure that would haveallowed banks to underwrite securities for the first time since theDepression-era Glass-Steagall Act.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
