Ford declined to disclose details of the bids, but aspokesman said the Dearborn, Mich.-based auto maker expectsto narrow the field to one bidder within one or two weeks.</LP><TEXT>   Some analysts have speculated that Ford Aerospace couldfetch as much as $1.5 billion. But others have said FordAerospace's satellite-building and defense operations couldsell for less than $1 billion in a time of declining militaryspending.   Hughes and Alcatel, a telecommunications venture of ITTCorp. and Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, have entered ajoint bid, a Ford spokesman said. Hughes, already the largestmaker of commercial satellites in the U.S., is almostcertainly looking to extend its lead in that market bypicking up Ford Aerospace's extensive military andcommunications satellite operations. Los Angeles-based HughesAircraft said that, as a matter of policy, it couldn'tconfirm or deny any prospective acquisition.   Ford and General Electric Co.'s RCA unit traditionallybattle for the No. 2 position in the industry, experts say,raising antitrust questions about a Ford Aerospace-Hughescombination.   Alcatel is already a subcontractor to Ford Aerospace on aproject for the International Telecommunications SatelliteOrganization, a 118-member group based in Washington that isresponsible for most of the satellite hookups in the Westernworld.   Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, meanwhile, has said it seesthe potential for Ford Aerospace enhancing its radar andelectronics lines.   Westinghouse has said it would like to expand intocommercial electronics and has been searching for possibleacquisitions. That business would build on the company'sstrong position in military radar and sensors and enableWestinghouse to supply air traffic control equipment toairports around the world. With the defense budget shrinking,Westinghouse is especially eager to move into commercialaerospace.   Ford said Westinghouse is bidding as part of a consortiumthat includes Carlyle Group, a Washington-based merchantbank, and Aerospatiale, a French aerospace concern.   A spokesman for New York-based Loral confirmed that thedefense electronics firm is a bidder and said FordAerospace's defense and space electronics operations offer &quot;anatural fit and development for us.&quot;   Just a few weeks ago, an investment banker close to theFord Aerospace deal said a number of companies were stillhoping just to purchase pieces of the Newport Beach, Calif.,subsidiary. Ford, however, has been eager to shed the entireunit in one piece.   The Los Angeles Times recently reported that MartinMarietta Corp. had submitted a final bid for Ford Aerospace,which also manufactures, among other things, the Sidewinderand Chapparal missiles. What may have happened to that offerwasn't clear. Officials of the Bethesda, Md., company weren'timmediately available for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
