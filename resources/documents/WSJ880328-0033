Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX ECO </IN><TEXT>   As 1988 began, confusion was rife in the stock market. Would the October stock market crash trigger a recession or worse? What stocks, if any, were safe or desirable? And where were interest rates, consumer spending and the dollar headed?    As Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, put it back in January: &quot;What we really need is for the first quarter to be over.&quot;    Well, it almost is, and the economic data and the markets' reaction show just how much conditions can change in the span of a few months. The economy turned out to be stronger than most investors thought. That strength translated into a 108-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average last week as investors became increasingly worried about inflation, higher interest rates and the possibility that the trade deficit might be harder to fix than supposed.    The market is still awash with recession fears, too, but the time frame has changed significantly. &quot;The question after the crash was 'How bad is the recession going to be?,'&quot; recalls Ms. Cohen. &quot;Now most people have given up on the idea that there's going to be a recession in the near term. So the new question is 'When will it come?'&quot;    Although she isn't worried about it at the moment, Ms. Cohen says that many investors now consider a recession to be the inevitable result not of the stock market crash, but of the strong economic growth that has been evident so far in the first quarter.    &quot;The first-quarter statistics look stronger than anybody thought they would,&quot; concedes Charles Clough, chief market strategist for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. But he argues that heavily indebted consumers would slow their spending enough to offset the gathering strength in the industrial sector, which has benefited from a weaker dollar. Although consumer spending so far remains relatively strong, Mr. Clough still contends that cutbacks in spending &quot;are just a matter of time.&quot;    The way Peter Canelo, chief market strategist at Bear Stearns, sees it, the financial markets have whipsawed themselves through just about every possible scenario since the crash. At the start of the first quarter, investors were hunkered down in a recession posture and buying such defensive stocks as utilities, he said. But as the quarter has evolved, portfolios have shifted toward consumer and business cyclicals. And now, although Mr. Canelo himself advocates a moderate outlook for the economy, he agrees with Ms. Cohen that investors are worried about the problems of a too-strong economy.    &quot;There has been a mini-economic cycle, if not in the real world, certainly in the minds of Wall Street,&quot; he says.    In any event, the stronger-than-expected first-quarter economy has given strategists like these some definite ideas about where to be in the stock market, although they don't all agree on where that is.    Mr. Canelo, for instance, began replacing defensive stocks with cyclical consumer and industrial issues early in February. He's especially attracted to U.S. companies with good export markets, reasoning that they will continue to benefit from the lower U.S. dollar.    Mr. Clough, with his scenario of debt-ridden consumers pulling back, contends that consumer issues are over-priced. And while he, too, favors mostly exporters, he's going one step beyond, advocating not just investments in exporters, but also in their suppliers. He reasons that as export demand remains strong, the big exporters will have to build new capacity. &quot;You want not the owner of the chemical plant, but the guy who builds the chemical plant,&quot; he said. He also reduced the stock portion of Merrill's model portfolio to 45% from 50% last week.    Ms. Cohen also advocates industrial issues, but with a caveat that investors not get caught up with the idea of buying according to some economic clock. She warns that the prices of many industrial issues already reflect the expected earnings increases that will flow from an economic environment favorable to export industries. And other companies that aren't particularly well situated to profit from the current stage of the economic cycle could still be well managed and undervalued.    &quot;You've got to separate the companies from the stocks,&quot; she said.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Investors shaken by Thursday's nearly 44-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to back away from stocks Friday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 1978.95, down 44.92. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 163.2 million shares, down from the 184.9 million shares that changed hands Thursday. Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of advancers 5 to 1.    Avon Products was one of the big gainers. The stock climbed 2 5/8 to 26 7/8 on rumors of a possible leveraged buyout and rumors that Ronald Perelman, the head of Revlon Group, might be taking a position. The company declined to comment on the buyout or Perelman rumors, but denied other speculation that its chairman, Hicks Waldron, is retiring.    Gillette rocketed up 2 3/4 to 46 3/4 as rumors of a takeover once again swept the market. Gillette has been an on-again, off-again takeover candidate for months.    Sabine gained 3 3/8 to 23 3/8. Pacific Enterprises agreed to buy Sabine for $24 a share, prompting Presidio Oil to withdraw its $20-a-share bid.    Zenith was up 2 5/8 to 19 3/4. The stock climbed after a business magazine reported rumors that Zenith might be about to sell its consumer-electronics division.    Koppers was off 1/8 to 58 5/8. Beazer PLC, which earlier had said it would boost its offering price to $60 a share if Koppers would negotiate a friendly merger agreement, went ahead and raised its bid to $60 despite lack of cooperation from Koppers. Koppers won a court order halting the offer for 10 days, and said it was considering recapitalizing or seeking a friendly suitor.    Staley continued to climb on takeover speculation. It rose 1 1/2 to 29 1/2 on rumors that British sugar refiner Tate andamp; Lyle, which owns 4% of Staley, was raising its stake. Tate andamp; Lyle wouldn't comment. </TEXT></DOC>
