There is a theoreticaljustification for choosing a maximum likelihood method over other estimationmethods to analyze continuously distributed data from genetic experiments:Maximum likelihood, as shown by R.A. Fisher who conceived the idea, inmost cases leads to the minimum variance in the parameters being estimatedfrom the data. A geneticist whose contributions to segregation analysisare well-known once observed to a gathering of professional geneticists- inelegantly for effect - that &quot;if you are not using maximum likelihoodmethods to analyze your data (of the sort referred to here), you ain'tnowhere&quot;. A strong statement, but empirical results almost always validatethe theory. The implication is that use of such methods can greatly increasethe efficiency of genetic experimentation by suggesting, at an earlystage of analysis, the direction further confirmatory breeding testsshould take. The utility of the maximum likelihood method demonstratedin an analysis of a data set.</TEXT></DOC>
