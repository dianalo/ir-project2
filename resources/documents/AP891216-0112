Bush said that except for ``some nuances,'' he and the Frenchleader are in general agreement on the ``big questions'' of how toreact to the political upheaval sweeping Eastern Europe. He did notelaborate.   At a joint news conference that wrapped up their one-dayCaribbean retreat, Mitterrand expressed satisfaction withU.S.-French relations. He said Secretary of State James A. BakerIII ``showed great understanding of the needs of Europe'' when hepointed the way to a new role for NATO in a speech last week. Bakersuggested NATO oversee reductions of troops and armaments and takenews steps to build contacts with the East.   At the same time, the French leader hinted broadly atdifferences over the issue of German reunification with West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl.   Said Mitterrand, ``Mr. Kohl is a patriot and he obviously hasreflexes which are not mine.''   Bush's voice was raspy from a cold and laryngitis as he and theFrench president fielded questions after holding private talks onthis sun-splashed island in the West Indies.   On another subject, Bush said he had no second thoughts abouthis much-criticized decision to send two top aides to China lastweekend for the first high-level contact since Beijing brutallycrushed pro-democracy forces in Tiananmen Square.   He said he ``already seen an indication, a couple ofindications'' of positive results from Chinese leaders, but did notprovide details.   Bush also said he was ``delighted yesterday when the Colombiangovernment brought to bay the, I think the man who is ranked thethird most prominent narco-terrorist in Colombia, Mr. (GonzaloRodriguez) Gacha.'' Gacha was shot to death in a gunfight withColombian police, but Bush did not directly refer to the man'sdeath.   ``It was a very courageous effort on the part of the Colombians.... I think we ought to salute them,'' he said.   Bush and Mitterrand both said they had discussed the change inEastern Europe, where several hard-line Communist regimes have beenswept away in recent months with the encouragement of SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Bush was asked if he would be willing to consider emergency foodaid for Eastern Germany, whose citizens are among millions inEastern Europe striving for greater freedoms after four decades ofcommunist rule.   ``Obviously, if there's emergency food aid required there. Wehave no request for that. But if it's required we would be veryresponsive, and would like to think others in the alliance wouldbe,'' Bush said.   Baker joined Bush for the talks at the end of his European trip,which included a stop in East Germany for a meeting with thereformist government leaders as well as opposition figures. Histrip to East Germany was designed to bolster the government as itplans for elections in the spring.   As for Eastern Europe, Bush said:   ``We spent a lot of time talking about Eastern Europe and thedynamic changes taking place there and inside the Soviet Union. AndI would simply not go into detail on this answer except to say Ifeel very close to President Mitterrand's views here. ... There maybe some nuances of difference, but in terms of the big questions ofEastern Europe, I feel reassured that President Mitterrand and Iare viewing these the same way.''   One of the ``nuances'' appeared to touch on the thorny issue ofGerman reunification.   Asked if the two men had an agreement to slow West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl's vision of closer ties between East andWest Germany, Bush said, ``No.''   Mitterrand said he had used an analogy in discussing Europeanchanges with Bush: ``If the horses of the team don't move at thesame speed, there will be an accident,'' he said.   Bush also dismissed the possibility of improved ties with Libya,saying he had not seen ``hard evidence'' of a ``renunciation ofinternational terrorism.''   Bush's decision to send National Security Adviser BrentScowcroft and Depury Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger toChina last weekend provoked sharp criticism in the United States,but the president said he had no second thoughts.   He said each country needs to decide whether to maintain thesanctions against Beijing that were implemented in the wake of lastJune's crackdown, but that he would advise against lifting anymeasures in place.   Even so, the administration said several days ago it might lifta ban on the export of three communications satellites that wouldbe launched by the Chinese.   En route to St. Martin, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid both Bush and Mitterrand ``felt they needed a face-to-facemeeting to discuss some of the more personal and private sides ofthe changes going on in Eastern Europe and their personalimpressions of Gorbachev and what's going on in the Soviet Union.''   European leaders, at their meeting at Strasbourg last weekend,endorsed the concept of a single Germany, but suggested a series ofconditions to ensure stability in Europe.   The Strasbourg session, hosted by Mitterrand, also producedstatements praising Gorbachev's initiatives and hailing recentchanges in Eastern Europe.   Mitterrand has been among European leaders urging that Sovietconcerns be taken into account when discussing the issue of Germanunification. Bush, too, has urged a cautious approach, arguingagainst setting a timetable and saying the eventual decision mustbe acceptable to both East and West Germans.   Despite their close relationship, France and the United Statesstill have some areas of disagreement.   France, which has not been a member of NATO's military commandsince 1966, has resisted the alliance's evolution into theprincipal Western forum for dealing with changes in Eastern Europe.   Regarding the sale of goods to Warsaw Pact nations that mighthave military application, the United States has taken a morecautious approach than Mitterrand or other European leaders haveadvocated.   The restrictions on such trade are policed by a Paris-basedorganization called COCOM _ the Coordinating Committee forMultilateral Export Controls _ made up of NATO nations and Japan.   Mitterrand also has endorsed Gorbachev's call for a 35-nationconference next year to discuss changes in Eastern Europe. Bush hasnot.</TEXT></DOC>
