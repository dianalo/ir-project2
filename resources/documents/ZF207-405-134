Engelberger, chairman of theDanbury, Connecticut, firm, says the 3M Company will distribute HelpMate,while Sweden's Electrolux will sell RoboKent.andM;Zenith's Heath has been selling its HERO robots for about six years.andP;  Thoughthese programmable, PC-controlled robots were designed as education andtraining aides, only about half of the approximately 15,000 HEROs producedare being used in schools and institutions.andP;  The rest are in the hands of&quot;robot hackers&quot; who program them to perform various odd jobs at home or inthe office.andM;Engelberger, sometimes called the father of robotics for founding Unimation,which installed the first industrial robot in 1961, expects the nascentservice-robot sector to rapidly outpace today's industrial robots.andP;  Thedapper 63-year-old predicts full-functioning personal robots will be able toclean your house and shine your shoes by the mid-nineties.andP;  They'll be commonfixtures by the end of the century, he says.andM;Other observers are less optimistic.andP;  PRAB Command president and CEO WalterWeisel expects early personal robots to be timid machines.andP;  By the year 2000,robots will be able to patrol the house at night, but don't expect them to beyour personal servants.andP;  Robot butlers will come later, foretells Weisel,three-time past president of the Robotic Industries Association, based in AnnArbor, Michigan, and president and CEO of PRAB Robotics, an industrial robotmaker and the parent company of PRAB Command.andM;A Rocky HistoryandM;The rocky progress of industrial robots breeds skepticism.andP;  Early in the1980s, many U.S.andP;  industrialists became caught up in a sci-fi fantasy thatembraced robots as the saviors of American industry.andP;  Businesses hoped to usethese tireless automatons to populate new factories and help beat back Sony,Toyota, and the rest of the Japanese companies.andP;  It didn't work.andP;  Many of theoverzealous predictions for robots never materialized.andP;  According to earlyforecasts, manufacturers should now be buying $2 billion worth of robots eachyear.andP;  But according to the Robotic Industries Association, last year's salesbarely topped $300 million, for about 3,500 machines.andP;  About 35,000industrial robots are currently installed in the United States.andM;Experts agree that people simply expected too much.andP;  Robots have proved to beadmirable workers in a variety of industrial tasks.andP;  In automobile plants,for example, robots work as expert painters and welders.andM;Smaller, more precise robots have earned a good reputation in assembly work,especially in manufacturing tiny components such as printed circuit boardsand disk drives.andM;Lessons LearnedandM;The hard lessons learned in industrial robotics will help developers ofservice machines.andP;  For starters, robots are nowhere near as dexterous aspeople.andP;  They require specialized tools at the ends of their arms, tailoredfor specific tasks.andP;  Cincinnati Milacron found that for a robot to install an8-ounce automobile tail lamp it needed a 150-pound fixture on its arm,because the job involved gripping the lens, positioning a gasket, runningscrews, and several other tasks a person can do while chewing gum.andP;  &quot;Rarelyon an assembly line do you find one person doing only one thing,&quot; says MarkSaberton, supervisor of applications engineering for Cincinnati Milacron'srobot division.andM;General-purpose robots, and probably early personal robots as well, will havegrippers that work like lobster claws.andP;  They'll be able to move chess pieces,but don't ask them to shuffle a deck of cards.andM;By far the most damning limitation for robots is the fact that they require aspecially structured environment.andP;  Most factory automations are deaf, dumb,and blind, and they're bolted to the floor.andP;  Work generally comes to them ona conveyor belt, each piece arriving in the exact same spot so they can findit.andP;  That's no problem in a factory, but most kitchens don't work that way.andM;The kitchen, says Weisel, &quot;is the most unorganized place in the world.&quot;andP;  Hesays that asking today's robots to find their way around such an environmentis asking too much.andM;Personal robots will clearly need greater sensing capabilities than factorymachines.andP;  The first of TRC's HelpMates, for example, navigates the halls ofa 12-story Danbury hospital with the help of cameras and ultrasound andinfrared distance sensors linked to a floor plan in its computer memory.andP;  TheHelpMate communicates with elevators via radiowave, and it stops on a dimewhen its touch-sensitive bumpers hit an obstacles.andM;Still, even elementary tasks demand marvelously complex sensing capabilities.andO;Today's best machine vision systems would have a hard time telling thedifference between a plate and the lid of a margarine tub.andP;  Nor would a roboteasily discern that a cup and saucer are two pieces instead of one.andO;According to research done at Stanford University, it would take the cerebralmight of 100,000 Cray supercomputers to mimic human sight.andM;Nevertheless, rudimentary service robots are on the way.andP;  PRAB's Weisel saysthe technology for his home sentry is already available.andP;  &quot;The walking,talking, mobile machine of the future is really a collection of pieces,&quot; hesays.andP;  &quot;Somebody just needs to package it in a form that's affordable.&quot;andM;Engelberger claims TRC can do just that.andP;  The company just completed a$600,000 study, funded by 3M, DuPont, Johnson Wax, Maytag, Emhart, andElectrolux, that estimated that three years and $13.5 million are needed tocreate a complete service-robot package.andP;  Early versions, says the robotpioneer, will skip some functions; they won't be able to climb stairs, forinstance.andP;  And they'll require some special features: sliding pocket doorsinstead of hinged doors; an intercom-like radio network for room-to-roomcommunication with its controlling PC; and a robot pantry to house the PC, acharging station, and special attachments such as vacuum hoses.andM;TRC hopes to sell a $50,000, 24-hour servant to people buidling new homesvalued at $250,000 or more, of which there are about 60,000 annually.andM;The advent of personal robots appears inevitable as more and more machinesdemonstrate their capabilities.andP;  About three-quarters of American jobs areconcentrated in service, Engelberger says, and labor shortages are growingmore acute.andP;  As companies work through the remaining pool of teenagers andsenior citizens, it may not be long before you see robots flipping burgers atMcDonald's.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
