Brain scans of 17 living patients pinpointed a site of areduction in brain tissue that apparently produces enlargement ofnormal brain cavities, said Richard Suddath of the NationalInstitute of Mental Health.   The enlargement of the fluid-filed spaces, called ventricles,had been observed since the 1930s, but nobody has known which partof the brain produces it, he said.   Failure of part of the brain to develop, or shrinkage, couldproduce the enlargement, he said.   If the new finding is confirmed, it points the way to ananatomical target for further study of schizophrenia, he said.   Suddath spoke to reporters at the annual meeting of the AmericanPsychiatric Association. He did the work with colleagues at themental health institute.   The brain scans, using a technique called magnetic resonanceimaging, found an average of a 20 percent reduction in the graymatter of the temporal lobes, compared with the volume found in 17normal people of similar age and size.   The temporal lobes lie beneath the temples on each side of thehead.   The less temporal lobe gray matter a patient had, the larger hislateral ventricles tended to be, implicating that tissue was atleast part of the explanation for enlargement of the ventricles,Suddath said.   Researchers do not know when the reduction in gray matterappears in comparison to when schizophrenia appears, he said. Itmay be a failure of the tisue to develop before birth or around thetime of birth, he said.   Daniel Freedman, director of the division of adult psychiatry atthe University of California, Los Angeles, NeuropsychiatricInstitute, noted that the study included few patients.   ``It's too soon to say'' whether it will pay off in betterdiagnosis or predicting response to treatment, he said.   But it is ``a promising start'' in using magnetic resonanceimaging to seek clues to brain abnormalities in schizophrenia, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
