Gustav Niebuhr   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/27/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><LP>   ATLANTA -- Dissident Southern Baptists votedoverwhelmingly to set up their own budget and government, inmoves that fell just short of secession from the SouthernBaptist Convention at an unusual three-day meeting here.   The group of about 3,000, representing the &quot;moderate&quot;faction of the denomination, voted to establish its ownadministrative body, called &quot;the steering committee.&quot; And itvoted to withdraw its financial support from Southern Baptistheadquarters in Nashville, Tenn., setting up a trust fundthat would support its own causes like foreign missionariesand possibly a new seminary.</LP><TEXT>   While there was no formal vote on the subject, many in thegroup expect the newly formed committee to hold its ownannual convention, eschewing the huge one that thedenomination holds every June.   By the end of the meeting, it was unclear whether thegroup would eventually decide to split from the denomination,or whether it would use its money and new voice as leverageto influence the conservative fundamentalist faction that hasruled the denomination for more than a decade. The moderatesand fundamentalists are bitterly at odds over the directionof the Southern Baptist Convention, which has been a bigconservative political force in Washington for the lastdecade. The group's actions could cause severe financialproblems for the denomination and could seriously dilute itspolitical influence.   Rev. Daniel Vestal of Dunwoody, Ga., chairman of thecommittee, said the actions represented the group's attemptat &quot;renewal&quot; of the denomination, rather than a prelude tosecession. And during the debates, the group rejected severalproposals that would have amounted to an outright break.   Its members declined to adopt a name for their neworganization, opting instead to call it simply &quot;theFellowship.&quot; They also rejected a motion to hold a springconvention in Augusta, Ga., where in 1845 the SouthernBaptist Convention was launched after a bitter dispute withnorthern Baptists over the issue of slavery.   But throughout this meeting, there was open and passionatetalk about secession. And many of the moderate Baptists heresaid they thought that a split was inevitable. &quot;I don't seeany reconciling taking place. The wedge {between the twofactions} is being driven in further and further,&quot; saidWalker Knight, publisher of SBC Today, a moderate newspaper.   A workshop on legal issues was dominated by questionsabout what would happen if moderates were to form their owndenomination -- how they could sue to regain control ofSouthern Baptist institutions and property like colleges,hospitals, orphanages and retirement homes, into which theyhave poured millions of dollars. Several Baptist lawyersurged the steering committee to hire outside law andaccounting firms that could assist them in such legalbattles.   An official of the Southern Baptist Convention, whoattended the meeting as an observer, said he thought theactions taken by the new group amounted to nothing less thana split. &quot;I think there definitely has been a newdenomination formed,&quot; said Lee Roberts, a member of thedenomination's ruling executive committee. &quot;I don't thinkthere's any question about it.&quot;   The actions represent a new tack for the moderates, whohave fought internally to regain control of the denominationsince 1979. With vastly superior organizational skills, thefundamentalists since then have tightened their grip on thedenomination. They have barred from the leadership those whodon't share their strictly conservative religious andpolitical views and have even forced some out of theseminaries and national Baptist agencies.   But it is the moderates, who have contributed well morethan half of the denomination's income during that time, morethan 60% by their own estimates. Even with their support, thedenomination has had some financial trouble, leading to around of layoffs and the curtailment of some programs.</TEXT></DOC>
