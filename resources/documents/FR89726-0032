Whitehorn, Office ofthe General Counsel, C-50, (202) 366-9307, Department of Transportation,400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20590.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Department of Transportation's(DOT or Department) policy on advertising of air transportation, 14 CFR399.84, states that all price advertisements of flights, tours, or componentsof tours must state the entire price of the advertised flight, tour, ortour component or the ads will be considered to be unfair and deceptiveand thus in violation of Section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958(49 U.S.C 1381) (``Act''). Similarly, our public charter rules, 14 CFR380.30(e), require that any price listed in charter solicitation materialsfrom direct or indirect air carriers or their agents state the entire priceof the charter, tour, or any tour component. The policy and the rule aredirected at preventing consumer harm that could result from unfair or deceptivetrade practices.On December 24, 1985 (Order 85-12-68), the Department issued an exemptionfrom the price advertising rule and policy statement to permit direct andindirect air carriers for scheduled and charter service and tour operatorsto state the United States international departure tax separately fromother charges in advertisements and promotional materials, provided thatthe ads clearly state both the amount of the tax and that it must be paidby the passenger. In two other orders, Orders 88-3-25 and 88-8-2, the Departmentsought to expand the 1985 exemption to cover similar charges, i.e., immigrationfees and security surcharges. These two orders were recently struck downby the U.S. Court of Appeals on procedural grounds. <T3>Alaska </T3>v.<T3> Skinner</T3> (868 F. 2d 441 (D.C. Cir. (1989)))  <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Change to Rule: Parts 380 and 399</ITAG>The Department proposes to amend both the charter and scheduled-serviceprice advertising provisions. Consistent with the Department's currentenforcement policy, the proposal would permit a separate listing of government-imposedor -approved charges where the charges are levied on individual passengersand, in the case of government-imposed charges, the advertiser collectsthem to be remitted to the levying government. For the reasons stated inthe orders cited above\1\<NOTE/> the Department does not consider such ads to be unfair ordeceptive provided they are clear and the total amount to be paid by theconsumer can be calculated easily by adding the separately-stated fixedamounts. An ordinary person reading such ads would be aware of the totalamount to be paid for the transportation and, in addition, would be providedwith valuable information on associated government-imposed or -approvedsurcharges. The Department's experience indicates that these kinds of adsdo not cause passenger harm.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\The order were not published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.The change to the codified provisions would not cover all taxes, charges,fees, and surcharges levied by Federal, state, local or foreign governments,but only those levied on a per passenger basis. Separate listings of passengersurcharges that are not government approved but are set by a carrier inresponse to a governmental charge that was not levied on a per passengerbasis would be considered deceptive. For example, if a local governmentimposed a per-gallon tax on aviation fuel purchased at its airport, a carrierwould be free to increase ticket prices for flights departing from or arrivingat that airport. However, such additional fees must be included in thetotal advertised air fare_not listed separately. If listed separately ona per passenger basis, such surcharge would likely provide inaccurate informationon the per passenger cost to the airline of the government fee.The proposal would continue to allow the separate listing of the $3 U.S.international departure tax. (See Order 85-12-68). Under the proposal,and consistent with existing practice which the Department has not foundto have caused any confusion in the past, advertisers also would be ableto continue to advertise one-way fares that require round-trip purchases,provided that the advertisement indicates clearly that these fares areavailable only in conjunction with a round-trip purchase.Advertisers, under the new rule, would continue to be able to list componentsof a tour package separately, as long as all of the costs are stated clearly,and also list separately any government-approved or -imposed charges leviedon a per passenger basis. The proposed change would not effect the currentInternal Revenue Code requirements regarding the eight percent federaltax on all tickets for domestic transportation (see 26 U.S.C 7275). Itshould also be noted that the Anti-Head tax provision of the Act (49 U.S.C.1513) precludes certain state and local fees to be imposed on a per-passengerbasis.Under section 411, the Department is responsible for protecting aviationconsumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices. These changes areintended to implement that authority fully and clearly and without placingany restrictions on the industry that are not necessary and that wouldtend to limit airline price competition. The specific charges that wouldbe permitted to be listed separately either are limited, or apply onlyin certain markets or for certain flights, thus making if difficult orimpossible to publich advertisements with one way and round-trip faresto multiple destinations and include the charges in single advertised rates.Commenters should address what effects the proposed changes will have uponconsumers and upon advertisers. Would the changes be sufficiently clearso that advertisers will be able to comply? Is the proposed language sifficientlybroad so that consumers will be able to discern what is being offered ina given ad and at what price?On April 21, during the drafting of this document, the Air Transport Associationof America (ATA) filed a petition asking the Department to initiate rulemaking.This NPRM is consistent with that request, and thus the request is granted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12612, the Department in promulgating regulationsis required to review the implications of its actions on the states. Inthis case, the responsibility for regulating and setting advertising standardsfor the aviation industry has long been a function and responsibility ofthe Federal government, as provided by the Federal Aviation Act. Thus,Federalism ramifications will be minimal, if any. In addition, this rulemakingwill codify longstanding Federal practices, recently overturned by a courton purely procedural grounds.In particular areas the states' ability to enforce advertising rules andpolicies has been preempted by the DOT rules. For example, states wouldbe preempted from regulating airline advertising of fares and schedulessince DOT has specific rules covering deceptive practices in these areas.To allow the 50 states to regulate price advertising and institute relatedenforcement proceedings would subject the carriers to inconsistent standardsand thus seriously interfere with interstate commerce. The Airline DeregulationAct of 1978 enabled carriers to offer their services on a competitive basis,in terms of services and prices. Prosecutorial action and court decisionsin different jurisdictions could affect a carrier's ability to compete.For example, if a state attorney general in state A forced an air carrierto include all taxes in its quoted fare (as opposed to the proposal whichwould allow the carrier to separate the per capita taxes), the carriercould be placed at an unfair competitive position vis-a-vis other carriersnot before the state enforcement authority or one who advertised in anout-of-state publication, or vis-a-vis a foreign carrier. In addition,section 105 of the Federal Aviation Act specifically prohibits state regulationrelated to airline rates, routes and services and state regulation of advertisingthat can significantly affect airline rates, routes and services couldclearly violate that provision. Thus, the Federal aviation Act and thecommerce clause dictate that there be one industry-wide price advertisementstandard.In reviewing whether it would be feasible for each of the states to regulateprice advertising as they saw fit, there are a number of possible considerations.For example, the states could help to curb advertising abuses. On the otherhand, without a uniform policy, carriers would find it virtually impossibleto put together nation-wide advertising programs that accurately portraythe price of their services. Price competition would suffer, thus deprivingconsumers of lower fares. Comments are requested on what, if any, are theFederalism implications of this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork</ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. No. 96-511) establishes policies andprocedures for controlling paperwork burdens imposed by Federal agencieson the public. If a rule does in fact impose such a burden, approval fromthe Office of Management and Budget is necessary before the burden canbe imposed.This proposal does not impose any paperwork burdens on advertisers. Thisrule merely codifies existing practices and enforcement policies. In addition,even if the NPRM were not merely codifying existing practices and policies,there would be no burdens imposed on the industry since the rule wouldnot require that an advertiser state surcharges separately; it merely permitsthat form of advertisement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact Analysis and Review</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 on ``Federal Regulation'' and the DOT Policies andProcedures require the preparation of a regulatory impact analysis forevery ``major'' rule. A major rule is defined as a regulation that is likelyto result in: An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individuals, industries,Federal, State or local governments, or geographic regions; or a significantadverse effect on competition, productivity, innovation, or on the abilityof United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises.Under the above criteria, this rule is not considered ``major''. However,due to public interest, it is considered to be ``significant'' under theDOT Policies and Procedures. The economic impact of this rulemaking willbe so minimal that an economic evaluation is not warranted. Those subjectto the rule and policy will be able to continue to advertise their services,consistent with past industry practices, so there should be no additionalcosts to consumers or advertisers. Moreover, uniform rules could make advertisingmore efficient.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. No. 96-354, is designed to ensurethat agencies consider flexible approaches to the regulation of small businessesand other small entities. It requires regulatory flexibility analyses forrules that will have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.While this proposal may affect a substantial number of small entities,the proposed changes will not have a significant impact on them. Therefore,I certify that this rulemaking will not have a significant impact on asubstantial number of small businesses or entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>14 CFR Part 380Public charters, Surety bonds, Advertising, Antitrust, Charter flights,Consumer protection, Education study program, Travel agents, Tour operators.14 CFR Part 399Administrative practice and procedures, Advertising, Air carriers, Antitrust,Agreements, Archives and records, Consumer protection, Foreign air carriers,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Travel agents.In consideration of the foregoing, Parts 380 and 399 of Title 14, Codeof Federal Regulations, are amended to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 380_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
