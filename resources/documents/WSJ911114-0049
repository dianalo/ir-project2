Investors reacted by dumping the stocks of other smallcompanies with products related to acquired immune deficiencysyndrome, including some that soared last week afterbasketball hero Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson said he is infectedwith HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, which causes thefatal disease. MedImmune tumbled 2 1/4 to 51 1/4; AppliedImmune Science fell 1 3/4 to 25 1/2; and Repligen eased 1/4to 17 3/4.</LP><TEXT>   These stocks weren't the only victims on the biotechnologyfront. Investors handed a two-day, 12% loss to high-flyingSynergen, after the Boulder, Colo., company scrapped plansfor a drug to treat diabetic-related leg ulcers because itwasn't effective. Since Tuesday, Synergen has fallen 8 1/8 to59 7/8.   Investors also shied away from other frothy biotech stocksas the bad news for Immune Response and Synergen underscoredthe long, costly and often unpredictable road traveled byyoung developers of genetically engineered drugs.   The stocks of a number of newly public, early-stagebiotech companies fell. Among them, Altheon dropped 1 to 261/4; Glycomed slipped 7/8 to 16 1/8; Alkermes fell 3/4 to 191/2; Isis Pharmaceuticals eased 1/2 to 19 1/4; CORTherapeutics dropped 1 to 19, and Somatogen fell 1 to 37 1/4.   Late in the day, some investors even cashed some of theirgains in many of the biotechnology industry's largest andmore seasoned companies: bellwether Amgen fell 1/2 to 58 7/8,Chiron dropped 1 1/2 to 72; Genzyme tumbled 1 1/4 to 53;Immunex skidded 2 to 56 3/4; Cetus declined 1/4 to 19, andBiogen fell 1 to 47 3/4.   Nonetheless, over-the-counter stocks edged up to yetanother record for the fifth consecutive session. The NasdaqComposite Index rose 0.49 to 556.17, a 0.09% gain, asinvestors sought out cheaper small stocks. Declining stocks,however, edged out advancers, 1,046 to 1,014, as OTC volumefell to 208.5 million shares from 214.6 million Tuesday.   But investors reserved their worst for high-flying ImmuneResponse. Before yesterday's plunge, shares of the Carlsbad,Calif., company had soared from a mere 2 7/8 last Dec. 31 toan all-time high of 62 3/4 as optimistic analysts said thatImmune Response could have an AIDS vaccine ready by 1993.   Based on an approach suggested by polio vaccine developerJonas Salk, who is a director of the company, Immune Responseis developing a vaccine for patients just like Mr. Johnson:those infected with the HIV virus but not yet showing anysymptoms of AIDS or its related problems. In a joint venturewith Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, which trades on the New York StockExchange, the company began a final round of tests on 100HIV-infected patients and was hoping the Food and DrugAdministration would expedite approval of its vaccine.   On Tuesday, an FDA advisory panel met to discuss whethersuch vaccines could forgo more extensive tests, but decidedunanimously that the risk was too great. Ira Loss, an analystwith County NatWest Securities who attended the meeting, saidthe FDA panel wasn't willing to take the risk that a barelytested vaccine could later cause unforeseen problems forpatients.   The meeting of the FDA's vaccines and related biologicalproducts advisory committee &quot;raised a number of red flags&quot;indicating that Immune Response's clinical trial won't passmuster with the FDA regardless of the results, said DeniseGilbert, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Analysts said the FDA panel's recommendation won'tnecessarily slow down the race to bring an AIDS vaccine tomarket but could raise hurdles for some contenders. Thedecision was considered a special setback for ImmuneResponse, which has said it would be first to seek FDAapproval for its vaccine.   &quot;People have been expecting approval (of Immune Response'sAIDS vaccine) in 1993 with no competition,&quot; Ms. Gilbert said.&quot;It's more realistic to look for approval in 1994 withcompetition.&quot; Kidder Peabody analyst Robert Kuport was evenmore pessimistic: he advised investors that approval mightnot come before 1995 or later.   Ms. Gilbert added that members of the FDA panel seemedmore favorably impressed by the trial designs of two otherAIDS vaccines developers, Genentech Inc. and a joint ventureof American Home Products Corp. and MicroGeneSys Inc.   Immune Response's chief executive officer and president,James Glavin, declined to comment on the FDA meeting until hecould consult both with company scientists who were there andwith RhonePoulenc officials. On the New York exchange,Rhone-Poulenc tumbled 2 3/4 to 55 3/4.   The FDA panel suggested that a laboratory test that showsthat a vaccine bolsters infection-fighting CD-4 cells isn'tsufficient &quot;in and of itself&quot; for determining efficacy inHIV-infected patients, an FDA spokesman said. The test mustbe shown to correlate with real patient benefits, such asdeclines in opportunistic infections or a delay inprogression to AIDS.   The FDA panel's conclusion could require other developersof early-stage vaccines to conduct longer and costlierstudies than some investors might have hoped, Kidder Peabodyanalyst Robert Kupor said.   Elsewhere, shares of SciMed Life Systems leapt 6 1/4 to 581/2 after a 3 1/4-point jump Tuesday. Several analysts spokepositively about the maker of heart valves after meeting withthe company Monday, Dow Jones Professional Investor Reportsaid. Cowen andamp; Co. analyst Daniel T. Lemaitre said SciMed gaveassurances that sales of its Express catheter will continueoverseas, despite concern about patent challenges in the U.S.SciMed's shares plunged in September after the company saidpatent issues could cause it to withdraw sales of thecatheter.   Several stocks fell amid disappointing earnings reports.Nordstrom sank 1 5/8 to 37 1/2. The department store operatorreported third-quarter net income of 24 cents a share, downfrom 25 cents a share a year earlier. The consensus estimateamong analysts surveyed by First Call, a unit of ThomsonFinancial Networks, was 25 cents for the latest quarter.   Staples slipped 1/2 to 24 3/4. The company reportedthird-quarter net income from operations of 16 cents a share,up from nine cents a share a year earlier. The officeproducts retailer's results were in line with expectations.   Helian Health dropped 7/8 to 6 7/8 after the company saidthat a $180,000 charge will reduce its fourth-quarterearnings to between two cents and three cents a share,compared with year-earlier earnings of seven cents a share.The charge is related to its plan to sell an Austin,Texas-based occupational health care operation.   LTX Corp. slumped 1 1/4, or 37%, to 2 1/8. The maker ofintegrated circuit test equipment said that it expects topost losses for the first and second quarters of its 1992fiscal year. Citing sluggish demand in the personal computerand semiconductor industries, LTX said it will lay off 150workers.</TEXT></DOC>
