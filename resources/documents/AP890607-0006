Britain and Switzerland joined the United States in banningmilitary sales to China _ the toughest measures announced by themany countries protesting Beijing's military crackdown ondemonstrators that left hundreds of people dead.   France, Holland and Sweden froze political relations, barringcontacts involving Chinese government officials.   The Dutch government summoned Chinese Charge d'Affaires Li QinPing and told him Holland ``is exceptionally shocked by the violentand brutal actions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.''   Austria also delivered a firm message to the Chinese ambassadorin Vienna and the orchestra of Vienna University scheduled acommemorative concert for the Chinese victims.   Dutch government officials canceled a state visit to China byQueen Beatrix, and British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe saida November visit by Prince Charles and Princess Diana ``cannot takeplace as long as those responsible for the atrocities ... remain incontrol of the Chinese government.''   Howe also said Britain will not allow mass immigration from thecolony of Hong Kong, due to be handed over to China in 1997. He saidan open door policy ``could more than double the ethnic minoritypopulation of the United Kingdom.''   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said earlier that about 3.5million Hong Kong Chinese eligible for British passports will not begiven the right of residence in Britain but Britain will show``greater flexibility'' about immigration from Hong Kong.   She expressed ``utter revulsion'' at the Chinese crackdown andsaid, ``We will be thinking how best to demonstrate that inpractical ways.''   Howe announced Britain immediately is banning arms sales to Chinadue to the ``slaughter of innocent people'' and banned militarycontacts and visits by senior Chinese officials.   The Defense Ministry refused to say what arms Britain sells toChina but the Britain's Independent Television said sales amountedto $4.68 million a year.   Washington sells China more than $600 million of militaryequipment a year, and private U.S. dealers do about $85 millionworth of military sales with Beijing.   Francois Godet, a Swiss Defense Department official, said the banmarks the first time Switzerland has withdrawn approval fromcontracts already agreed. he declined to say how much the contractsare worth, but sources said they amounted to a few million dollars.   Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno said his government is notconsidering economic sanctions against China but Foreign Ministryspokesman Taizo Watanabe said that because of the situation aidprojects ``cannot go on.''   Japan is the largest contributor of aid to China and theassistance, most in the form of loans, totaled $6.1 billion as of1987, the latest figures available.   The 12-nation European Economic Community strongly condemned theChinese action and appealed to authorities to stop using force. Butit did not propose any joint protest measures.   People in Singapore copied a protest started in Hong Kong onMonday by withdrawing deposits from Bank of China branches. A crowdformed outside the bank, where a senior official said three to fourtimes more people than usual withdrew money. He said he did not knowhow much was withdrawn.   Meanwhile, many governments warned their citizens in China toleave the country or take strict security precautions as reportsspread of Chinese soldiers battling each other in Beijing.   The U.S. State Department urged the 1,440 Americans in Beijing toleave and planned arrangements for U.S. airlines to fly them tosafety.   British Airways said the British Embassy in Beijing chartered aBoeing 747 to evacuate Britons to Hong Kong.   About 50 Canadians, heeding advice from Ottowa to leaveimmediately, flew out Tuesday, and 200 more were to leave on aspecial flight Wednesday, a spokesman for the Canadian Embassy inBeijing said.   The Australian government chartered a jumbo jet to evacuate itscitizens and Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said the increasingviolence indicates ``the larger potential for really full-scalecivil war erupting.''   Japan arranged for two special commercial flights to BeijingTuesday to help its citizens leave and Foreign Ministry officialssaid further flights were planned, pending permission from Chineseauthorities.   New Zealand and Switzerland also hired jets for evacuations.   Achille Occetto, head of Italy's Communist Party, urged theKremlin to take a strong stance against the massacre and distancedhis party from the leaders responsible for the crackdown. Italy hasthe largest communist party in the West.   In Moscow members of the Congress of Peoples Deputies called onChina's leaders to use ``wisdom, reason and a weighted approach''but did not denounce the violence. The Soviet Foreign Ministry hasmade no comment. The two communist giants are trying to mend fencesafter decades of estrangement.   Protesters, mainly Chinese students, demonstrated outside Chineseembassies in Stockholm, Sweden; Madrid, Spain; Abu Dhabi, UnitedArab Emirates; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; the Hague in the Netherlands;Athens Greeceother and other cities.   In Johannesburg, South Africa, the pro-government newspaper TheCitizen questioned why South Africa is the target of internationalboycotts ``when whatever faults we have are tiny by comparison ...to the horror of the massacre of Beijing.''   East German state newspapers indirectly took sides with theChinese government's use of force.   The Junge Welt newspaper appealed to East Germans not to believemedia reports that bore the ``viewpoint of Western politics'' andgave ``good grades to those holding out in Tiananmen Square toprotest the government, and bad grades to those calling for calm andreconciliation.''</TEXT></DOC>
