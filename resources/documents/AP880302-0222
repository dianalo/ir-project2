The new Social and Liberal Democrats Party hopes to end thedominance of the governing Conservatives and the socialist LaborParty, the main opposition.   In a mail referendum, Social Democrats voted 18,722 to merge and9,929 against, or slightly under 2-1. Liberals approved the union46,376 to 6,365, or more than 7-1, said to the London-basedElectoral Reform Society, which counted the votes.   Separate party conventions approved the merger last month.   Only 55.5 percent of the 52,000 Social Democrats and 52.3percent of the 90,000 Liberals voted. Protracted infighting overthe merger had split both parties.   Liberal leader David Steel and Robert Maclennan, the SocialDemocrat leader, toasted each other with champagne.   Steel, who is expected to be elected leader of the new party,said he looked forward to ``success and the future.'' Maclennandescribed the vote as ``clinching.'' The party is to be officiallylaunched Thursday.   David Owen, who resigned as Social Democrat leader in oppositionto the union, had urged members to boycott the vote and called it a``fiasco.'' He plans to continue the Social Democrats as a separateparty.   The two parties began the merger process after placing a distantthird in last June's general election, won by Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher's Conservatives.</TEXT></DOC>
