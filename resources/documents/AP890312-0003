No injuries werereported.   ``We speculate it's man-caused,'' said Big Bend National Parkspokesman Robert Rothe. ``We haven't had any lightning strikes inthe area.''   Seventeen firefighters battled the High Chisos mountains blazewhich campers reported early Saturday afternoon. A fire crew ofMescalero Apache Indians from Alamogordo, N.M. was expected Sundayto help fight the fire.   `I can look out the window and see the glow of the fire up in themountains,'' said Kim Alexander, an assistant manager at ChisosMountain Lodge located about 2,000 feet below and at least fivemiles from the fire.   ``The glow of the fire appears over Emory Peak,'' Alexander said.Emory Peak, at 7,830 feet, is the highest point in the Chisos range.   The fire burned woodlands, mostly oak, pine and juniper andtrails in the Chisos were closed, officials said.   About 100 campers, mostly college students on spring break, wereevacuated from the High Chisos area, said park ranger Karen Boucher.   Rothe said park officials believe the fire wouldn't spread muchSaturday night because of a combination of weather conditions,including falling temperature and wind speed, and rising humidity.   The blaze is the first in the 708,221-acre southwest Texas parkthis year, Ms. Boucher said. Last year there were 27 brush fires,she said, but only two scorched more than 300 acres.   The Chisos Mountain Lodge was filled to capacity with more than140 visitors Saturday night, Alexander said. He said officials toldhim the fire presented no immediate danger to the lodge.</TEXT></DOC>
