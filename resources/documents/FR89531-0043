Applications must bedirected toward laboratory and/or field measurement activities that willclearly establish the relationships between, and factors controlling, (1)changes in atmospheric composition (particularly carbon dioxide), (2) changesin radiative fluxes, and/or changes in local temperature and long-termchanges in global temperature. The research projects may involve, for example,studies of local, regional, or global scale changes over time scales ofhours, days, seasons, or years and may propose collection of new data setsor analyses based on existing data. In each case, applications must definethe relationship to be investigated, its importance in determining theglobal climatic response to changes in atmospheric composition, the degreeof current understanding and uncertainty, and the extent to which the proposedexperimental and related analysis effort will improve under-standing andreduce existing uncertainties in establishing the quantitative linkages.Consortia are encouraged to submit coordinated applications in order toconsolidate scientific resources, equipment, and personnel. It is anticipatedthat multiple grants will be awarded for a three to five-year period beginningin early 1990. The Carbon Dioxide Research Program awards grants as smallas $150,000 and as large as $450,000, but most grants are less than $250,000.Some of the funds being set aside for this program may be used to supportresearch proposed by DOE laboratories.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>To permit timely consideration for award in FY 1990, applicationssubmitted in response to this Notice should be received by DOE, Acquisitionand Assistance Management Division by September 15, 1989.

Extensive theoretical and computer modeling studiesover the past few decades suggest that the global average equilibrium willincrease by a few degrees Celsius in response to a doubling of the atmosphericcarbon dioxide concentration or its radiative equivalent when also consideringthe atmospheric concentrations of other greenhouse gases. Since the early1800's, the induced radiative change has been almost 50 percent of theradiative change expected from a doubling of the carbon dioxide, due primarilyto concentration increases of carbon dioxide and methane. Therefore, thepossibility exists of a significant discrepancy between the model predictionsand the behavior of the global climate.As part of its ongoing research program in carbon dioxide research, theDOE is supporting a wide variety of atmospheric research studies to carefullyexamine the adequacy of model representations of the climate. To supplementthese studies, this announcement of research interest solicits applicationsemphasizing analysis of the observed behavior of the climate and the linksto changes in atmospheric composition. These studies may include investigationsof the linkages from atmospheric composition changes to climate changes,of factors (e.g., the radiative effects of cloud cover) not now being fullyor realistically represented in climate models, and other atmospheric changesthat may have been changing the climate over the past few hundred years.Important aspects to be contained in any application will be the abilityof the proposed applicant to use experiments and observations to clarifythe relationship of composition changes and climate changes. Approximately$3,000,000 has been set aside to fund the quantitative links initiativein FY 1990. Funding for FY 1991 and succeeding years will depend on theresources required for scientific and logistical support for the researchas well as new, innovative ideas.Information about submission of application, eligibility, limitations,evaluation and selection processes, and other policies and procedures maybe found in the OER Application and Guide for the Special Research GrantProgram. The application kit and guide is available from the U.S. Departmentof Energy, Acquisition and Assistance Management Division, Office of EnergyResearch, ER-64, Washington, DC 20545. Telephone requests may be made bycalling (301) 353-4375. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Numberfor this program is 81.049.<ITAG tagnum="6">D.D.
