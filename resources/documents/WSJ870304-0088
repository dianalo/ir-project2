Traders said the daily price gain -- the largest in four months -- reflected the stepped-up efforts of Saudi Arabia in recent days to exhort fellow members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to refrain from undercutting the oil cartel's fixed prices, which have been in effect for a month.    Some brokers said OPEC's firm stance was evident, for instance, in a report that Qatar chartered two crude carriers to store unsold oil rather than sell it at a discount, as well as news that France agreed to buy 25,000 barrels a day of Saudi crude at official prices through July.    In addition, indications that the Saudis have cut production in recent weeks to sop up excess output by other OPEC members added to the price gains, analysts said. Some of the analysts said, for example, that Saudi output in the last two weeks of February was held to just 75% of its quota of more than four million barrels a day.    &quot;The Saudis are determined to defend the OPEC accord, which they see as a major triumph for their own stated policies,&quot; said Mehdi Varzi, former Iranian diplomat and currently senior energy analyst in London for Kleinwort Grieveson Securities.    Added Axel Busch, editor in chief of ICIS-LOR Group Ltd., a London-based energy information service: &quot;We have now seen firmly established a floor price for oil.&quot;    Other traders and analysts were more cautious. &quot;While the Saudis have staying power, the smaller OPEC members don't,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York. He cited pressures on Nigeria, Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates, among others, to sell crude at below OPEC's fixed prices in the coming weeks.    Said one trader in New York: &quot;You can't read too much into one day's price move.&quot;    Nevertheless, crude oil prices reversed a recent slide in which they skidded 10 of the past 13 sessions, falling 11%, or more than $2 a barrel. Yesterday, April crude oil contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 96 cents a barrel, to $17.35 in extremely heavy trading. Estimated volume of 91,000 contracts was still short of the exchange's volume record of 97,200 contracts set Dec. 18. The rally was the largest daily price gain since Oct. 30, when prices soared $1.31 a barrel.    Heating oil futures prices for April delivery on the New York Merc surged 2.98 cents a gallon, to 46.28 cents, and April unleaded gasoline contracts rose 2.84 cents, to 50.13 cents a gallon.    The spot, or non-contract, market also soared. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the major U.S. crude, rose 95 cents a barrel, to $17.35, while the European benchmark, North Sea Brent, rose 80 cents a barrel, to $16.65 in late trading.    Some traders said that weekly industry statistics released after the market closed yesterday likely will lead to further gains today.    The American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. distillate stockpiles for the week ended last Friday fell about 4.4 million barrels, or 3%. And U.S. refinery utilization fell to 78.1% of capacity from 79.7% the week before.    &quot;We should see a (price) pop on the product side&quot; in response to the statistics, said Eric Bolling, an oil broker in Boston for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    The futures-market rally was driven largely by short covering, or buying contracts to offset those sold earlier, traders said. &quot;Everyone was leaning to one side of the ship, and it tipped the other way,&quot; said James Ritterbusch, vice president, energy futures, at PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago. Analysts said computer-guided technical buying added to the day's gains.    What precipitated the price action in New York were strong rallies in the Asian and European markets before the New York Merc opened yesterday, analysts said. Some traders said, for example, that aggressive Japanese buying of Dubai crude oil and increased barge activity by Swiss and West German oil companies reflected fresh demand.    Some analysts said U.S. prices will continue to jump as the huge stockpile of world oil is whittled away. Peter Cardillo, futures trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co., New York, said he anticipates crude oil prices, for instance, will rise to as high as $18.50 a barrel in the coming weeks.    But many traders and analysts said it is premature to conclude that the recent price slide is over. &quot;I'd have to see these moves confirmed by additional buying,&quot; said Stephen Piasio, vice president, international energy department, at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., New York. In the meantime, he said he expects a &quot;choppy, confused market with increased volatility.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
