(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Mississippi Senate toiled through ahot summer Saturday on a county government reorganization billinspired by an FBI corruption investigation that snared dozens ofpublic officials.   Senators worked their way through 32 proposed amendments, hopingto pass a version of the bill that could be reconciled with onepassed by the state House on Thursday.   Lawmakers have been meeting since Wednesday in a special sessioncalled by Gov. Ray Mabus, who instructed them to consider mandatingcounty supervisors to turn over day-to-day government management tocountywide administrators. Sixty of the 82 counties have some kindof ``beat'' system, in which supervisors oversee the dailyoperations of their individual districts.   Much of the Senate debate preceded a 32-20 vote on an amendmentto set a Nov. 8 referendum for voters to decide whether theircounties would maintain roads on a district or countywide basis.   Sen. Terry Jordon argued that the governor should be able to seta later referendum to leave time for review by the U.S. JusticeDepartment, which could hear complaints under the Voting Rights Actof 1965 about whether the reorganization would dilute the votingpower of minorities.   Sen. Alan Heflin, author of the amendment, argued that countiesinvolved in the referendum should be spared the expense of runninga special election.   The House, which adjourned after a brief Saturday session until2 p.m. Sunday, also set the referendum for Nov. 8, the presidentialElection Day.   The Senate version of the bill would require counties toimplement central purchasing, receiving and inventory controlsystems. They also would be required to implement countywide roadconstruction, leaving only maintenance for voters to decide.   Mabus, inaugurated in January, tried unsuccessfully to push aso-called ``county unit'' bill through the Legislature's 120-dayregular session earlier this year.   Negotiators were unable to work out differences between Houseand Senate versions and the bill died. Mabus then vetoed a billthat would have given 20 percent pay hikes to all of the state's410 supervisors and vowed to call the special session.   Calls for county government reform came in the wake of a federalcrackdown on corrupt county purchasing practices that has so farresulted in charges ranging from mail fraud to extortion against 56supervisors in 25 counties.   Of those, 42 have pleaded guilty, six have been convicted byjuries, one was acquitted, one died before coming to trial, onedied after sentencing and another was declared mentally incompetentto stand trial. The remainder have charges pending.</TEXT></DOC>
