Lured by the huge run-up in the stock price of Spain Fundand Germany Fund in late 1989, many investors loaded up onfunds that buy foreign stocks, especially the single-countryfunds.</LP><TEXT>   But none of these funds ever matched the dizzying heightsreached by the Spain and Germany funds, so disgruntledinvestors have been dumping their shares of these foreignclosed-end funds. For bargain hunters, that spellsopportunity.   Here's why. A closed-end fund is so called because itissues only a fixed number of shares, which then tradepublicly like any other stock. Shares in new closed-ends aresold at a premium to the value of the fund's portfolio,though most closed-end funds eventually fall to discounts andbargain-hunters can buy $1 of assets for, say, 85 cents.That's what's happening now with the foreign closed-ends.   First Philippine Fund, for instance, closed yesterday at$9.50 a share, down from $18 in November. Future GermanyFund, which hit a high of $19.25 on its first day of tradingin February, is now at $14.125. Both funds trade at steepdiscounts to the value of their portfolios.   Investors tend to buy closed-ends either because of a fundmanager's track record or because of a fund's discount. Butlately, it's been possible to buy funds that boast both steepdiscounts and good management.   Richard Barone, chairman of Cincinnati's Maxus InvestmentGroup, likes to buy closed-end funds that are at bargainprices. But he doesn't simply buy the funds with the deepestdiscounts. Instead, he uses a computer to root out thosefunds trading at discounts that are bigger than usual.   On that basis, Mr. Barone has lately been eyeing AllianceNew Europe, Growth Fund of Spain, Swiss Helvetia Fund andTurkish Investment Fund. Alliance New Europe, for instance,has traded at an average discount of 6.3% since its launchthis year. But yesterday, it closed at $9.75, a 14% discountto its $11.30-a-share portfolio value.   Unlike Mr. Barone, Kenneth Gregory of Litman/Gregory andamp;Co., a San Francisco investment adviser, buys funds primarilybecause of the fund manager's track record. &quot;For a closed-endfund to make sense for us, it has to have the same appeal asan open-end {mutual fund}, which is that we believe in themanagement,&quot; Mr. Gregory says.   But though Mr. Gregory doesn't buy a closed-end fund justbecause it has a fat discount, he also is intrigued byAlliance New Europe. He points out that the fund is run byGlenn Wellman, who also runs Alliance International, atop-performing mutual fund. Over the past five years,Alliance International has returned 27.7% a year, comparedwith 25% for the average international fund tracked by LipperAnalytical Services.   Alliance New Europe was launched in early May but isn'tyet fully invested in stocks. Mr. Wellman says he eventuallyhopes to have 20% of the fund's assets in unquoted securitiesand 40% in companies with market values of less than $500million. The rest of the fund assets will be inlarger-company stocks. Mr. Wellman has already boughtpositions in two Hungarian companies, Graboplast, a specialtytextile maker, and Ibusz, a tour operator that is about to belisted on Vienna's stock exchange.   Another closed-end that combines both a fat discount and awell-regarded fund management company is Scudder New Europe.The fund, which is managed by New York's Scudder, Stevens andamp;Clark, came public in February at $12.50 a share but closedyesterday at $10.125, a 15% discount to its portfolio value.   Fund manager Carol Franklin has recently been buyingsmaller companies like Caird Group, a Britishwaste-management company, and Fika Finanz AG, a Swisssupplier of construction chemicals. But like Alliance's Mr.Wellman, Ms. Franklin is also looking for unquotedsecurities. The fund, for instance, has bought a part sharein a twin-hulled cruise ship now being built in Finland. Theship should go into service in 1992, and Ms. Franklin hopesthe stock will be launched publicly soon after.   Ronald Olin, a closed-end fund specialist who runsHouston's Deep Discount Advisors, says the discounts on mostforeign closed-ends aren't yet big enough to tempt him. Buthe is interested in Templeton Value, a global small-companystock fund that has 39% of its assets invested in the U.S.   Templeton Value's prospectus says that if the fund tradesat an average discount of 5% or more during the 12 weeksleading up to June 30 or Dec. 31, then shareholders shouldget a chance to vote on converting the fund to a regularmutual fund. That would eliminate the fund's discount, whichyesterday stood at 11%.   Whether or not Templeton Value converts to a mutual fund,the fund's shareholders are at least in good company. LastAugust and September, mutual fund maven John Templeton bought$1.4 million of the fund's shares, saying that he was bullishon emerging growth stocks. The shares now trade slightlybelow Mr. Templeton's buying price.   ---                      Stocks on Sale                                                                                                          Investors have been bailing out of closed-end funds thatbuy foreign stocks, so many of these funds are now trading atbargain prices.
