World Bank Vice President Will Wapenhans lauded theeconomic stabilization accomplished by Poland'spost-communist government but urged &quot;even more rapid&quot; stepstoward creating a market economy.   The World Bank has loaned Poland a total of $781 millionfor five projects since January. Officials say additionalloans amounting to about $2 billion are envisioned during thenext two fiscal years.   The new loan, repayable over 17 years with a five-yeargrace period, is to help wean Poland from its dependence oncoal as an energy source.

The Home Affairs Ministry said the MoralHome Society, with about 200 members, was set up in 1986 toobtain legal status for the church, whose followers arewidely known as &quot;Moonies&quot; after their South Korean leader,Sun Myung Moon. Singapore banned the Unification Church in1982, saying its &quot;continued existence was prejudicial topublic welfare and good order.&quot;                                                                                                          PORTUGAL CLAMPS DOWN                                                                                                          The Bank of Portugal clamped down on foreign borrowing byPortuguese companies by requiring that 40% of the value ofany capital raised abroad must be deposited innon-interest-bearing accounts with the central bank.

THE JAPANESE AND TECHNOLOGY                                                                                                          Three out of four Japanese adults think technologyimproves their lives, but more than half worry it could costthem their jobs, according to a poll released by the primeminister's office. In a nationwide poll of 3,000 Japaneseover the age of 18, 76% said technology improved theirstandard of living. But 55.5% said they feared their jobscould be performed by robots, computers and other automationtechniques. Of those surveyed, 32.1% believed technologywould never make their jobs redundant.                                                                                                          SOVIETS' DWINDLING OIL OUTPUT                                                                                                          Soviet oil production has entered a long-term downwardtrend, a phenomenon that might trigger a world-wide spiral inoil prices, a private research institute in Japan reportedlysaid. According to a Japanese news agency, the Institute ofEnergy Economics reported that oil output by the Soviet Uniondropped by 300,000 barrels per day in 1989 and has beenplunging by 500,000 barrels per day this year. The exhaustionof large oil fields, surging costs of exploration, andreduced investment in the energy sector are said to befactors behind the diminishing output.                                                                                                          WHALING BAN UNDER REVIEW                                                                                                          Norway and Iceland, eager to lift a ban on whaling, saidthere are enough whales in the world's oceans to resume somecommercial hunting. &quot;There are no reasons to wait,&quot; Iceland'sMinister of Fisheries Halldor Asgrimsson told a conference inthe Netherlands of the 36-nation International WhalingCommission. Conservationists say the move is the biggestthreat to whale populations since a global ban on commercialwhaling took effect in 1986.

The Japanese bank also reportedly revealed it has obtainedconsent from the Finance Ministry and has already put a partof the loan into action. This would be the first move by aJapanese bank to resume giving new loans to China since asuspension of credit to the country following the militarycrackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators last year.   Air China will use part of the loan from Mitsubishi Trustto buy new aircraft, according to the agency report.   In another report, the agency said the head of theExport-Import Bank of Japan hinted at the possibility ofresuming the bank's financial support for trade with Chinaeven under Japan's current economic sanctions against China.&quot;The bank is willing to reopen financial support for Japaneseexporters who do business with China on a case-by-casebasis,&quot; the bank's president, Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, was quotedas saying.
