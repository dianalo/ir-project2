At least 10 mines were crippled, and the Baltic port of Szczecinwas without dockworkers or public transportation in what appearedto be the nation's worst labor unrest since 1981. Unlike thenationwide strikes of 1981, however, the current unrest was limitedto two geographical areas.   ``We will not back down from our demands that Solidarity belegalized,'' said Andrzej Milczanowski, a strike leader at theSzczecin docks where about 2,000 workers held an occupation strike.   ``The authorities must realize that if they want improvement,they must restore Solidarity,'' he said.   Reporters witnessed new strikes at the 3,000-worker Krupinskimine in Suszec and the 3,500-worker ZMP mine in Zory. The state-runPAP news agency said strikes also were under way at the First ofMay and Borynia mines. All the struck mines are in the southwesternregion of Silesia.   Piotr Hertig, a spokesman for the Inter-Mine Strike Committee inJastrzebie, said two other mines were on strike in the region:Brzeszcze and Jaworzno. Mine officials reached by telephone deniedthe report.   Since the strikes began Tuesday, Poland has lost 110,000 tons ofcoal production worth $5.5 million, Antoni Pilny, a spokesman forthe Jastrzebie area mining authority said Friday. The state-runnews agency PAP put the strikes' cost at $222,000 a day.   The Council of Ministers accused strike organizers of trying to``take advantage of the material difficulties and hardships ofeveryday life.   ``Instigators and organizers of the illegal strikes, in which asa rule only part of the crew takes part, not infrequently place atthe top of the demands the issue of reactivating the former`Solidarity.' It is an unrealizable demand,'' the council said.   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa warned that workers at the LeninShipyard in Gdansk would join the labor unrest unless thegovernment legalizes Solidarity. The stikers are also demandingmore pay and better working conditions.   The government says the strikes disrupt safety maintenance atthe mines, allowing potentially explosive methane gas to build up.   ``We appeal to our brother miners, to their families, youth andthe whole population of the province to maintain reason'' and endthe strikes, the Katowice provincial council said after a specialmeeting.   Miners were told over loudspeakers they could be fired if theydid not return to work, but they ignored the warning. Dozens ofpolice vans moved into the area around Jastrzebie, center of thelabor unrest, but there were no signs of immediate plans to end thestrikes by force.   ``We are not afraid. All the other miners are with us!'' shoutedan unidentified striker at the gate of the July Manifesto Mine,where the coal strikes began Tuesday.   ``We do feel danger,'' said Grzegorz Stawski, spokesman for theInter-Mine Strike Committee, ``but we get used to it.'   Walesa said at a Gdansk rally that employees of the LeninShipyard, where he works as an electrician, were prepared to stopwork Monday.   ``Fantastic! We were waiting all the time for Gdansk to joinin,'' said a woman at the Inter-Mine Strike Committee. She spoke oncondition of anonymity.   A strike by Gdansk shipyard workers eight years ago gave birthto Solidarity. The free trade union movement had a 15-month legalexistence before it was suppressed and outlawed after martial lawwas imposed in December 1981.   Lenin Shipyard workers struck in May to support steel workerswho shut down the huge Nowa Huta steel mill. The Nowa Huta strikeended with a pre-dawn police raid, and the workers later gave upwithout a settlement.   Walesa's call for a sympathy strike was applauded by the 500-600workers at the rally, who chanted ``There is no freedom withoutSolidarity,'' said Slawomir Majewski, a Solidarity activist inGdansk.   No talks with management were announced. The strike committeesaid it was prepared to negotiate if its legal advisers and apriest were let into the July Manifesto mine.   Miners are treated as an elite sector of Poland's working classand earn the equivalent of about $177 a month, nearly twice thenational average, but frequently are expected to work seven-dayweeks under often hazardous conditions.   They say their pay is not enough to survive with Poland's 60percent inflation and nationwide price increases this year of 40percent.   This week's strikes surpassed the number of work stoppages inApril and May, which until then marked the worst labor unrest inPoland since 1981.   Production was stopped at the strikebound mines, idling about40,000 workers. It was impossible to determine what percentage ofthe mine employees actively supported the strikes.</TEXT></DOC>
