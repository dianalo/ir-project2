The Department hasnow completed that administrative review in accordance with section 751of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review</ITAG>Imports covered by the review are sales of color television receivers,complete and incomplete, from Korea.The order covers all color television receivers regardless of tariff classification.The merchandise is currently classifiable under item numbers 684.9246,684.9248, 684.9250, 684.9252, 684.9253, 684.9255, 684.9256, 684.9258, 684.9262,684.9263, 684.9270, 684.9275, 684.9655, 684.9656, 684.9658, 684.9660, 684.9663,684.9864, 684.9866, 687.3512, 687.3513, 687.3514, 687.3516, 687.3518, 687.3520,of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated. The results ofthis review cover complete color television receivers and incomplete colortelevisions, the components of which are imported together. The resultsdo not include imports of incomplete color television receivers (i.e. colorpicture tubes or printed circuit boards). We have postponed review of theseitems until the next administrative review. This review covers four knownmanufacturers and/or exporters of Korean color television receivers tothe United States currently covered by the order, and generally the periodApril 1, 1985 through March 31, 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminaryresults as provided by section 353.53a(c) of the Commerce Regulations.We received timely comments from the petitioners (International Brotherhoodof Electrical Workers, International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Technical,Salaried and Machine Workers, AFL-CIO-CLC, Independent Radionic Workersof America, and Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO), Zenith ElectronicsCorporation, and three respondents, Gold Star Co., Samsung ElectronicsCo., and Daewoo Electronics Co. We received additional comments from Samsungon July 22, 1987, but because those comments were received after the closeof the comment period, we have not considered them for the final results.(We also received comments from the petitioners, Zenith, and the respondentsconcerning mathematical or clerical errors. We have corrected such errorsbut have not addressed them specifically in this notice.)<T3>Comment 1: </T3>Zenith and the petitioners argue that the Departmentshould implement the Court of International Trade's (``the CIT's'') rulingin <T3>Zenith v. United States </T3>(April 24, 1986) by adding to United Statesprice (``USP'') the internal taxes rebated or forgiven upon the exportationof the merchandise to the extent that those taxes were ``passed through''and included in the price of televisions sold in Korea.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Court of International Trade issued its finaldecision in <T3>Zenith </T3>on January 14, 1988. Because we have appealed that decision,we are continuing to assume that all indirect taxes in the home marketare passed through to the ultimate customers. For our reasons as to whywe did not attempt to measure the amount of tax ``passed through'' to customersin the Korean market, see our final results of review of the Japanese televisioncase (53 FR 4051 (February, 1988)).We agree that the amount of tax forgiven by reason of the export of televisionsto the United States should be aded to USP under the statute. We calculatedthe adjustment by multiplying the net sales price by the tax rate and addedthe result to USP. To avoid artificially inflating or deflating margins,we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> Zenith is concerned that the respondents have included,and the Department has accepted, various indirect expenses in the FMV offsetwhich are not selling expenses. Respondents have an incentive to assignnon-selling expenses to sales offices so the pool of expenses includedin the offset is maximized. Zenith urges the Department to require respondentsto demonstrate that each home market indirect expense is a selling expense.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We do not interpret andSection; 353.15 of our Regulationsconcerning indirect selling expenses in the home market to be limtied onlyto selling expenses in sales offices and, as excluding so-called non-sellingexpenses incurred by those offices. The pool of indirect selling expensesin the home market should include those expenses which are similar to theexpenses incurred by the subsidiary in the U.S., whose function it is tosell merchandise. In this instance, the equivalent home market expensesare those which are incurred by the home market selling division in supportof the home market sales effort and which include certain general expensesassociated with selling.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> Zenith claims that the Department erred in not takinginto account the average age and balance of each account payable relatingto home market sales, and applying the respondents' short term interestrate to those average ages and balances to offset claimed selling expenses.Zenith maintains that the true cost of a discount or rebate is the discountor rebated amount minus the savings the respondent realizes by paying therebate or discount after the obligation to pay has been incurred.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> It is unnecessary to impute expenses/costs wherea company quantifies such expenses/costs, provides adequate documentationof those expenses, and the company's quantification accurately reflectsthe expense to the seller. This is unlike situations when an expense inherentlyexists in a transaction (e.g., credit costs when payment is delayed), yetno sales-specific quantification of such costs exists in a company's recordsand a sales-specific quantification must be calculated. In most cases whena rebate or discount system is in place, an allocated <T3>sales/specific</T3> cost exists in the company's records. Our examinationof the rebate and/or discount systems used by the Korean manufacturersindicates a system where the manufacturers paid rebates and/or discountsaccording to set schedules governed by contracts and/or purchase ordersbetween the manufacturers and the customers. As such, the amount of therebate/discount paid to the customer represents the allocated expense tothe seller.<T3>Comment 4:</T3> Zenith asserts that it is inappropriate for the Departmentto accept an imputed credit claim as a circumstance of sale adjustment,while using lower actual financing expenses for the respondents' cost ofproduction. While the Department recognizes that there is a distinctionbetween respondents' production and selling expenses, it also must recognizethat a producer's or seller's borrowing can be used to finance both productionand sales. Therefore, the Department still must account for the extentto which the imputed credit exceeds actual financing costs. Zenith proposesthat the Department account for the excess of imputed credit over actualfinancing expenses by making an adjustment to price in the cost of productionanalysis.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. The extension of credit by a selleris a selling expense. Therefore, differences in credit terms affectingprice comparability are adjusted for under andSection; 353.15(b) of our Regulationsas a cicumstance of sale. When it is not possible to determine the actualcosts associated with such credit terms, or where no express provisionfor credit has been made, we use imputed costs as the best reasonable alternativeof the costs for the total length of time credit is extended. For example,if a seller extends credit to its home market customers but makes no provisionfor credit on its U.S. sales, yet there is a time lag between shipmentand payment on U.S. sales, we would impute a cost of credit on the U.S.sales in order to make a circumstance of sale adjustment, even though thecost of credit on the U.S. sales did not result in an actual out-of-pocketexpense to the seller.On the other hand, in a cost of production calculation we are not concernedwith costs in the same way we are where there are differences in circumstancesof sale and adjustments must be made in order to compare U.S. and homemarket prices on an ``apple-to-apple'' basis. Therefore, whether imputedcosts used for a circumstance of sale adjustment are higher or lower thanrespondents' actual financing costs is not relevant for purposes of determiningcost of production. Under andSection; 3533.7(b) of our Regulations, we areinterested in determining the actual costs incurred to produce the merchandiseunder investigation in order to compare those costs with the revenue generatedfrom the sale of the merchandise to determine whether, in fact, sales havebeen made at below cost. To accomplish this, we are required to use thebest available information. Here, respondents' actual financing expensesrepresent the best available information for computing the cost of production.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> The petitioners and Zenith argue that respondents'allocation of home market advertising only over distributor sales is erroneousbecause advertising promotes respondents' color television sales regardlessof the class of customer. Further, this home market methodology is inconsistentwith the DOC's acceptance or respondents' U.S. advertising claim whichis based on an allocation of expenses over <T3>all</T3> U.S. color television sales, Korean-made televisions, U.S.-madetelevisions, and samples, even though sales of samples were not includedin the DOC analysis.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. We compare U.S. sales to respondents'home market sales to distributors or dealers because these sales are atthe same level of trade. As we stated in the previous review with respectto Samsung (51 FR 41365 (1986)), the home market advertising expense isan assumption of distributors' selling costs and is best quantified bythe total sales to distributors. Likewise, an allocation base that includessales of both Korean and U.S.-made televisions is appropriate because advertisingbenefits sales of all color televisions sold in the U.S., whether madein Korea or in the U.S., and whether or not included in the sales analysis.However, we agree with the Petitioners and Zenith that the U.S. samplesdo not benefit from advertising in the U.S. Therefore, we have eliminatedsamples in the allocation of U.S. advertising expenses.<T3>Comment 6:</T3> In the deficiency responses, respondents provided answersto the Department's inquiries about compensating deposits made againstloans from Korean financial institutions. Zenith argues that the Department``net out'' the interest earned on such deposits from the interest paidon short-term debt that is used to calculate the home market credit adjustment.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We adhere to our position in the second administrativereview of this antidumping duty order (51 FR 41365, Comment 77), that whenthe compensating deposit is not required by the loaning institution, thecost of the loan as reflected in the interest rate is unchanged. Therefore,any interest earned on the deposit does not affect the cost of the loanfor antidumping purposes. The respondents indicated that the compensatingdeposits were not required as a condition of obtaining the loans.<T3>Comment 7:</T3> In the final results of the previous review, the Departmentaddressed an issue concerning salary subsidies paid to indepndent contractorsas part of Samsung's home market warranty claim (51 FR 41365 (1986), Comment15). Zenith is concerned that in this current review, these salary paymentshave not been stripped out of Samsung's claim. Zenith argues that the salarypayments are ordinary payroll expenses and should not be included as variablewarranty expenses. Further, Zenith argues that to the extent that salarypayments to ``independent contractors'' are a common business practicein Korea, the Department should strip out such expenses from other respondents'warranty claims.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree. In our deficiency letter to Samsung, werequested that they separately identify that portion of the agents' salariesdevoted to repair work. However, Samsung did not comply with our request.It stated that Sumsung only pays warranty fees from warranty services providedby those agents.We stated in our final results in the previous review (Comment 15) thatwe did not remove fees to outside agents from the claim because the correctionwould change the claim by less than .1 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3> However, because Samsung did not identify that portionof the outside agents' salaries attributable to repairs, we have deductedthe entire ``fees to ourside agents'' portion of Samsung's direct expensesin its warranty claim and have included it in the total of Samsung's indirectselling expense adjustment.<T3>Comment 8:</T3> Zenith comments that in the first administrative review,the Department discovered that a dual pricing structure exists in Korea.Because respondents have not disclosed the full costs of manufacture ofhome market and export model matches, Zenith urges the Department to requirethem to submit those full costs of manufacture so that the differencesin merchandise adjustment will include the effects of the dual pricingstructure.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. In our verification of respondents'differences in merchandise claims during our second administrative review,we verified that respondents used the actual prices paid for differingparts when calculating an average price for physical differences. In accordancewith our position stated in the final results of the second administrativereview, we have not made any changes to respondents' calculations of physicaldifferences in merchandise. (See Comment 78, 51 FR 411365 (1986)).Further, we disagree with Zenith that the total cost of manufacture ofexport models and home market matches should be used to calculate the differencesin physical characteristics adjustment. Differences in manufacturing costswhich are not due to physical differences in the merchandise itself donot qualify as adjustments. Comparing total manufacturing costs, as Zenithsuggests, would result in characterizing all cost differences as resultingfrom physical differences, regardless of the actual nature of the costs.<T3>Comment 9:</T3> Zenith argues that the Department should include inits margin analysis those color televisions imported as ``samples''. Respondentsclaim that ownership of those televisions did not transfer from the manufacturer.Zenith believes that even if the respondents correctly omitted these ``sample''sets, all costs associated with the importation of those sets must be deductedfrom the USP. Further, Zenith argues that Samsung's upward adjustmentsof total quantity and value of U.S. sales, to account for certain televisionsand parts used for warranty purposes, is inappropriate. By upwardly adjustingthe total quantity and value of its U.S. sales, Samsung is artificallyinflating total purchase price (PP) sales value. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> As explained in our final results of review in theJapanese television case, (52 FR 8941 (1987)), concerning color televisionsimported as samples, we agree that goods entered for consumption are subjectto an antidumping order whenever ownership transfers from the exporterof such goods. However, information on the record in this proceeding showsthat transfer of ownership of the receivers referred to as ``samples''never occurred. The televisions referred to as ``samples'' were used forengineering or testing purposes, or were used as display models at electronicproducts shows and were either kept by the exporter or were destroyed.Therefore, they have not been included in our analysis. We agree with Zenith that Samsung has inappropriately accounted for theparts and televisions used for warranty replacement parts. As we statedin the final results of the previous review, we accepted Samsung's downwardadjustment of gross unit price to account for the parts and televisions.(See Comment 19, 51 FR 41365 (1986)) However, in Samsung's deficiency responsein this administrative review, it stated that it adjusted its sales quantitiesand prices on the computer tape to account for certain televisions andparts. We have examined the computer tape data and have concluded thatSamsung has upwardly adjusted its PP sales values and quantities. For thereasons stated in our previous review, we have stripped out the additionalsales values and quantity sold, using Samsung's response as best informationavailable. <T3>Comment 10:</T3> Zenith notes that the statute limits the duty drawbackadjustment to drawback which can be attributable to duties originally paidwith respect to the content of the merchandise later exported. Therefore,the Department should remove that portion of the drawback adjustments receivedon a fixed-rate basis. Further, Zenith highlights certain problems with Daewoo's drawback adjustment.Zenith maintains that Daewoo's adjustment is based on the amount appliedfor, not the amount actually recieved. Further, for several models Daewoohas used estimates to establish its claim, such as drawback paid in priorreviews or drawback from similar models for instances in which it has norecord of payment. Zenith concludes that Daewoo's claim should be denied<T3>in toto</T3>. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree that duty drawback given on a fixed-ratebasis should not be included in the duty drawback claim. In this reviewwe have adhered to our position in the final results of the second administrativereview (See Comment 20). Respondents have shown that their calculationof the fixed-rate amount was in accordance with Korean Customs Law. Therefore,we have accepted that portion of their claims. Concerning Daewoo's duty drawback claim, Daewoo states in its responsethat for four models, it had no record of duty drawback during the reviewperiod but would submit the actual amounts as soon as they were available.Daewoo has not submitted those amounts during this proceeding. Therefore,we conclude that no duty drawback was paid and we have not added duty drawbackto USP for those models. <T3>Comment 11:</T3> Zenith comments that the Department has incorrectlyoffset U.S. commissions with indirect selling expenses in the home market.Zenith argues that commissions paid on U.S. sales compensate the recipientsfor both direct and indirect selling expenses. Unless the commission isbroken up into its direct and indirect expense components, and the FMVoffset capped at the level of the indirect expense element only, the commissionoffset will overcompensate for the indirect expense portion of the commissionand not allow for the removal of the direct selling expense portion ofthe commission from USP. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. Our regulations require us to makean adjustment for situations in which a commission is paid in one marketbut not in the other market. That adjustment is limited to ``actual otherselling expenses'', or the ``total amount'' of the commission granted inthe other market (Commerce Regulations, 353.15(c)). We do not interpretour Regulations to require us to limit the offset to the direct expensesof the commissionnaire. Therefore, we have offset the full amount of thecommission in the U.S. with indirect selling expenses in the home market.<T3>Comment 12:</T3> Zenith urges the Department to remove from respondents'USP all antidumping legal fees. Zenith argues that legal fees are expensesincurred in selling merchandise covered by an order in the U.S. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. For our position on this matter, seeComment 79 in our final results of the second administrative review inthis case, cited <T3>supra</T3>. <T3>Comment 13:</T3> Zenith argues that the statute instructs the Departmentto reduce USP by the amount of any charges or expenses incidental to bringingthe merchandise from the country of exportation to its place of deliveryin the U.S. (19 U.S.C. 1677a(d)(2)(A)). Therefore, the Department shouldreduce the USP by the amount of estimated antidumping duties and any expenseassociated with paying such duties. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. We do not consider antidumping dutiesto be expenses related to the sales under consideration. In addition, addingthese estimated duties to the dumping margins would artifically inflatethem. <T3>Comment 14:</T3> Zenith notes that the Department has ignored its requestto verify respondents' submissions. Zenith states that the failure to performverification allows the possible misclassification of expense claims byrespondents to remain hidden from the Department. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> In accordance with section 776 of the Act, it isthe Department's practice to conduct verification only when we receivea request for revocation from a respondent, when we receive a request fromthe domestic industry and have not conducted a verification during thetwo immediately preceding reviews and determinations, or when the domesticparty has shown ``good cause'' for verifying the information received duringthe administrative review. In its written request (April 30, 1986) foran administrative review of the antidumping duty order, Zenith requestedthe Department to conduct a verification of certain specified Korean manufacturers.Zenith speculated that a verification in the third administrative reviewwould be necessary because the Department would be including sales of U.S.-assembledsets in its analysis, and because the recent decision of the Court of InternationalTrade regarding the treatment of taxes rebated or not collected by reasonof exportation of the merchandise (19 U.S.C. 1677a(d)(1)(C)), would effectthe Department's analysis. See <T3>Zenith Electronics Corp.</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> Slip Op. 86-43, cited <T3>supra</T3>. We determine that Zenith has not shown ``good cause'' in accordance with1677e(a)(3)(B), for verifying the information submitted by the respondents.Zenith requested the verification before the Department even initiatedthe third administrative review. Therefore, Zenith's request did not resultfrom an analysis of the information submitted in the course of this review.Further, we have postponed our analysis of U.S.-assembled sets until thefourth administrative review, for which we have conducted verifications.With regard to Zenith's speculation that the Department would not receiveenough information to act in accordance with the ruling in <T3>Zenith</T3>, cited <T3>supra</T3>, we have determined that adequate information exists onthe record, and we have made the necessary changes to our analysis. (SeeComent 1) <T3>Comment 15:</T3> Zenith argues that the Department severely understatesthe antidumping cash deposit on entered merchandise by basing the weighted-averagemargins on statutory USP and not on the merchandise's entered value. Uponentry of the merchandise into the U.S., the Customs Service applies theweighted-average percentage to the declared transfer price as best informationavailable. Zenith argues that because this transer price is often lessthan statutory USP, the absolute dollar amount of dumping duty is lessthan the dollar amount that would be the result if the percentage werebased on statutory USP. Therefore, Zenith urges the Department to calculatethe deposit rate as a percentage of the entry's entered value and not asa percentage of statutory USP. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. In this review we have followed ourposition as stated in the final results of the review of the Japanese televisionreview (52 FR 8940 (1987), Comment 7). Section 736 of the Statute requiresthe Department to instruct U.S. Customs ``to assess an antidumping dutyequal to the amount by which the foreign market value of the merchandiseexeeds the United States price of the merchandise.'' (19 USC 1673e(a)(1)).At the time of entry of any shipment, U.S. price has yet to be determined.Since cash deposits of estimated dumping duties are required at that time,we instruct Customs to require such cash deposits expressed as a percentageof the only value available, which is the entered value. If the amountof the antidumping duties deposited should be less than the amount assessed,the Department will assess interest on the difference. <T3>Comment 16:</T3> Zenith and the petitioners comment that the Departmentincorrectly disregarded Gold Star's returned, home market merchandise inits calculation of the FMV for Gold Star's sales. Returned merchandiseappears on the computer tapes as negative quantity sales. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We consider it appropriate to eliminate returnedmerchandise from the analysis by matching the returns with the originalsale. We requested Gold Star to eliminate the returns by matching themwith the original sale and eliminating both transactions from the database.Gold Star made the corrections and submitted a revised tape which the domesticparties received under administrative protective order. <T3>Comment 17:</T3> Zenith notes that in its test for sales made belowthe cost of production for Gold Star, the Department omitted from the analysiscertain commissions granted on home market sales. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree and have discussed those commissions fromthe home market price in our test for below-cost sales for Gold Star. <T3>Comment 18:</T3> Zenith argues that in its test for Gold Star's homemarket sales made below the cost of production, the Department erroneouslyapplied Gold Star's production expense ratio to the cost of manufactureof its home market models. Zenith states that it is inappropriate to applyan expense ratio based on sales to manufacturing costs. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree that it is inaccurate to apply an expenseratio based on sales value to a production cost value. We have recalculatedGold Star's expense ratios using the cost of goods sold listed in its auditedfinancial statements. <T3>Comment 19:</T3> Zenith notes that the Department removed from itsanalysis of Gold Star's PP sales those sales with a negative net USP. Zenithpoints out that this is inconsistent with the Department's treatment ofnegative net U.S. prices in ESP calculations. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree. A negative net U.S. price indicates thatthe sale was made at a loss. We see no reason to exclude these sales fromthe margin analysis. Therefore, we have corrected the PP computer programto include those sales with a negative net USP. <T3>Comment 20:</T3> Zenith notes that the Department incorrectly adjustedDaewoo's FMV for physical differences in merchandise for one model becauseDaewoo has miscalculated the claim on the computer tape. Zenith arguesthat the Department should use the amount listed in Daewoo's questionnaireresponse. Further, Zenith contends that Daewoo's freight expense claim for home marketfreight from the factory to one of several regional warehouses should betreated as an indirect selling expense.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We have accepted Daewoo's physical differences adjustmentfor that model, as listed in Daewoo's response, because we consider thatamount to represent Daewoo's claim. Accordingly, we have made the correctionto the computer tape.Additionally, we intended to treat Daewoo's freight claim from the factoryto the warehouse as an indirect expense in accordance with our final determinationin the previous review (See Comment 93, 51 FR 41365 (1986)). We have correctedthis for the final results.<T3>Comment 21: </T3>Zenith notes that Daewoo had stated in its questionnaireresponse that it did not yet know the exact amount of its U.S. advertisingexpense for the review period; however, it would report that expense tothe Department at a later date. Daewoo has failed to provide the Departmentwith its claim. Zenith argues that the Department should disallow Daewoo'shome market advertising claim because the statute only permits an adjustmentfor a difference in expenses between the home and U.S. markets. The statutedoes not allow a one-sided reduction in FMV when similar expenses are knownto exist in the U.S. but which are unreported.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with Zenith. Because Daewoo has not reportedits U.S. advertising expenses, we have denied its home market advertisingclaim as no difference in this type of expense has been established byrespondent.<T3>Comment 22: </T3>Zenith notes that the Department failed to adjustDaewood's ESP sales for royalty payments, certain movement charges anddiscounts.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Concerning the royalty payments, Daewoo's questionnaireresponse indicated that it did not make payments for those months in whichit had made ESP sales. However, Daewoo incorrectly calculated an averagemodel-by-model expense using the sales totals for each model; it shouldhave applied the per-unit royalty amounts to its ESP sales. We have correctedthis omission and have deducted the allocated royalty amounts from USP.Regarding Daewoo's movement charges and discounts, the omission of thoseexpenses from our analysis was an oversight and we have made the necessarycorrections.<T3>Comment 23: </T3>Zenith argues that the Department should deduct, fromDaewoo's ESP, overseas market development expenses incurred in Korea andlisted in Daewoo's Electronic Co. Ltd's income statement.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree. A portion of Daewoo's export selling expensesincurred in the home market should be considered an indirect selling expense``incurred by or for the account of the exporter in the United States'',in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1677a(e)(2), and should be deducted from ESP.<T3>Comment 24: </T3>Zenith notes that certain of Daewoo's sales of DCB-415PR,sold in March and April, 1986, and matched with home market model TCK-405PRW,were not included in the Department's analysis because there were no above-costsales of TCK-405PRW in those months. Zenith suggests that the Departmentuse the weighted average FMV for TCK-405PRW in October 1985 as the bestinformation available.Daewoo suggests that the Department use sales of its home market modelTCK-406VSW for comparison to export model DCB-415PR for those months inwhich no contemporaneous above-cost sales of TCK-405PRW are available.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>When there are no home market sales made in thesame month as the U.S. sale, we use a home market sale up to 90 days priorto and 60 days after the date of the U.S. sale (See Comment 6, 51 FR 41365(1986)). However, in this instance, we were unable to use such sales ofthe home market model because 95 percent of those sales were made belowthe cost of production for nine months out of the twelve month review period.We generally offer Zenith and the petitioners an opportunity to commenton all proposed model matches. Zenith and the petitioners had acceptedthe original match of TCK-405PRW to DCB-415PR. However, because Daewoo'sproposal was submitted at the end of the final comment period, Zenith andthe petitioners have not had an opportunity to comment. Therefore, we useconstructed value for TCK-405PRW using cost information submitted duringthis proceeding. This is in accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Act(19 U.S.C. 1677b(a)(2)).<T3>Comment 25: </T3>Zenith and the petitioners argue that the Departmentshould use Samsung's home market model CT-0901 for comparison with modelC8102MA. They believe this is a more suitable choice because model CT-0901has the same screen size as C8102MA and it satisfies the Department's viabilitycriteria.The petitioners argue that Samsung's home market model CT-2090 is a superiormatch to CT-500WDC compared to CT-2086 because CT-2090 contains the samecolor picture tube.Further, Zenith adds that the Department incorrectly matched Samsung'sU.S. model CT-389ZA to home market model CT-1629 in February, 1986_a monthduring which Samsung had reported earlier that it had no sales of CT-1629.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree that home market model CT-0901 is a preferablecomparison to C8102MA because it is more similar in screen size, an extremelyimportant physical characteristic of television. Additonally, we find thatthere were adequate sales of CT-0901 to warrant its use for comparisonpurposes.Concerning the February, 1986 sales of model CT-1629, the computer programinstead used sales of that model in February, 1985. The program also matchedsales of the export model with model CT-1639 in all months except February,1986 when our intention was to use CT-1639 for February only, and CT-1629for all other months. This is in accordance with our June 20, 1987 letterin which we preliminarily accepted Samsung's model matches. We have correctedthe errors and have matched sales of CT-389ZA with CT-1639 in February,1986 and with CT-1629 in all other months during the review period.Finally, we have rejected the petitioner's suggestion that we match CT-2090to U.S. sales of CT-500WDC. When selecting home market models for comparisonto U.S. models, we generally allow all parties an opportunity to commenton the proposed matches. Because the selection of models for comparisonpurposes can affect the margins on individual models, we conclude thatit is appropriate to seek comments from all parties. Samsung made its selectionsat the beginning of this proceeding and Zenith and the petitioners wheregiven the opportunity to comment on Samsung's suggested matches.However, because the petitioners did not propose this alternative untilthe end of the period for final comments, we did not have sufficient informationto evaluate the suggested match, and Samsung did not have an opportunityto respond to the petitioner's comments. Therefore, we have accepted Samsung'soriginal match of export model CT-500WDC to home market model CT-2086,as we are not convinced that this match was incorrect.<T3>Comment 26: </T3>Zenith argues that Samsung has failed to net out ofits home market SYPM rebate claim the income earned from the transactionsthrough the related financial institution. Transactions between relatedparties are intracorporate transfers of funds for which no adjustment shouldbe allowed. Zenith suggests that the interest income from the rebate couldbe shifted from Samsung to its related financial institution. Therefore,Zenith proposes that in those instances in which the interest income onSYPM sales exceeds the amount of SYPM rebate claimed by Samsung, the Departmentshould add the amount of the excess to FMV.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We were able to determine during the verificationin the previous review that the interest terms were the same for both therelated and non-related banks that Samsung used in its SYPM transactions.Therefore, the relationship between Samsung and its banks did not affectthe interest cost. Further, we have no basis to conclude that Samsung isshifting any income earned on the rebates it finances through its relatedinstitution. Therefore, we used the actual interest paid. For our treatmentof Samsung's SYPM rebate for this review, see Comment 60.<T3>Comment 27: </T3>The petitioners argue that the Department should anlayzeindirect purchase price sale (``IPP'') as ESP transactions. The Departmenthas been informed in <T3>PQ Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States </T3>(Jan. 27, 1987) that an ESP analysis is appropriatewhen a foreign producer exports, and its U.S. subsidiary imports, merchandisewhich is sold by the U.S. subsidiary to an unrelated purchaser prior toimportation of the merchandise.Further, the petitioners argue that Samsung's IPP sales fail to satisfythe DOC stated criteria. First, the petitioners state that Samsung ElectronicsAmerica (SEA) imported the merchandise for sale and maintained an inventoryin the U.S. Second, the petitioners contend there is nothing on the recordthat established these sales transactions as the customary commercial channelof that merchandise between the parties involved. Third, the petitionersbelieve that SEA functions in the U.S. much more as Samsung's U.S. marketingarm than as a mere agent. SEA acted as the importer for these sales andincurred significant marketing expenses for sales in the U.S.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree with the petitioners that Samsung'sIPP transactions do not meet the criteria we set forth in our preliminaryresults notice for this review, which were designed to address the Court'sconcerns in <T3>PQ Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States.</T3> According to its sales listings, SEA's IPP customersare a distinct and separate group from its ESP customers. Samsung has statedfor the record that it does <T3>not</T3> put the televisions it sells to this group of customers intoSEA's inventory in the United States and that such direct shipments arethe customary commercial channel of trade for that group of customers.For these IPP sales, we are not aware of any evidence on the record tosuggest that SEA functions as anything more than an agent for these sales.The IPP/ESP distinction recognizes SEA's different roles by the allocationand deduction of all indirect selling expenses from the inventoried sets.<T3>Comment 28: </T3>The petitioners argue that the Department erred inallowing respondents' duty drawback claims because their claims includeboth import duties and defense taxes. The Department should not have addedthe taxes to the USP as import duties refunded because the taxes are notimport duties. Section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act provides that USP shallbe increased by the amount of taxes imposed in the country of exportationwhich have been rebated or which have not been collected by reason of theexportation of the merchandise to the U.S. It is wrong to assume that thetaxes are passed on in the home market, and, unless the respondents candemonstrate that the taxes are passed on, the Department should deny respondentsthat portion of their duty drawback claims. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>During our verification of respondents' responsesin the second administrative review, respondents were able to show thatthe duties and defense taxes included in their duty drawback claims wererebated on merchandise exported to the United States. Absent evidence tothe contrary, we have accepted the tax amounts as part of respondents'claims. Regardless of its name, a tax imposed upon importation and rebatedupon exportation, in a manner identical to the treatment of the importduty, should not be treated any differently than an import duty. <T3>Comment 29: </T3>The petitioners note that there are discrepanciesbetween the home market sales quantities reported in Gold Star's June 1986model match submission and those used by the Department in its preliminaryanalysis. The Department should reconcile Gold Star's home market salesas reported in its model match submission with the sales listed on thecomputer tape, or else use best information available for the final analysis.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>In the revised home market sales data Gold Starsubmitted in February, 1987, we are satisfied that Gold Star accountedfor its returned merchandise by matching the returns with the originalsales. We consider the model-by-model sales quantities listed in the modelmatch submissions to be only estimates of quantities sold. The listingof individual sales entered on the computer tape is inherently more accuratethan the summary totals submitted with model match information becauseentries on the sales listing are obtained from individual source documentssuch as invoices. <T3>Comment 30: </T3>The petitioners question the methodology of the DOChome market sales viability test in this proceeding. In its June 20, 1986letter, the Department preliminarily accepted sales of one of Gold Star'shome market models to be compared with sales of several U.S. models, whilethe sales of that home market model amount to less than five percent ofthe total sales of the U.S. models. In another proceeding involving colorpicture tubes from Korea, the Department determined that the home marketsales volume relative to that in the United States should be consideredin the selection of models for comparison purposes. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>In order to determine whether respondents have sufficienthome market sales to use for comparison to sales of models in the UnitedStates, section 353.4 of our Regulations instructs us to determine thatthe total sales of such or similar merchandise is 5 percent or more ofthe sales of that merchandise to third countries. In making this determination,we established separate ``such or similar'' categories based on CTV screensize. All home market models generally within two screen sizes and containingthe same tuning system as a given U.S. model were grouped in the same category.The 5% viability test described above was then applied to each categoryan all were found viable. We do not consider sales of one model to constitutethe universe of sales for viability of the entire home market. We considersuch an interpretation of ``such or similar merchandise'' for purposesof determining home market viability, to be overly specific. <T3>Comment 31: </T3>Concerning Gold Star, the petitioners argue that itis inappropriate to use model CNR-842KZ for comparison purposes. The petitionersnote that this model is a discontinued model and the test for below-costsales reveals that few sales were made above its cost of production. Therefore,this model should not be used for comparison purposes because it was notsold in the ordinary course of trade.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree with the Petitioner's general propositionthat because a model was sold below its cost of production it necessarilywas sold out of the ordinary course of trade. The legislative history tothe below-cost provision of the Trade Act of 1974 explicitly states thatit is normal business practice both in the U.S. and in foreign countriesto sell discontinued merchandise at less than cost; therefore, such salesshould not be automatically excluded from consideration. <T3>See </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 571, 93d Cong. 1st Sess. 71; S. Rep. No. 1298,93d Cong., 2d Sess. 7310 (1973). However, we conclude that it is inappropriate to compare sales of modelCNR-842KZ for the two months during which 70 percent of its total saleswere made below its cost of production in the home market, due to its discontinuation,with sales in the U.S. for those same months (where the such or similarmodel was not being discontinued). If such comparisons were allowed, itwould be possible for the manufacturer to use the below cost sales of adiscontinued model in an antidumping analysis to manipulate its margins.In that way, U.S. sales could be made at unfairly low prices while at thesame time masking the true extent of the dumping margins. To avoid thepossibility for such manipulation, we conclude that where a model is discontinuedin the home market but not in the U.S., home market sales at below costare not in the ordinary course of trade for comparison purposes as intendedin the legislative history and thus may be properly disregarded. (Our considerationof the below-cost home market sales might have been different if at thesame time the such or similar U.S. model was simultaneously being discontinuedin the U.S.) Therefore, instead of model CNR-842KZ, we used the home market sales ofmodel CNR-9082 for comparison purposes for the two month period. CNR-9082is the model we selected prior to our preliminary determination to be comparedto sales of these same U.S. models in subsequent months, since it is themost similar model. <T3>Comment 32: </T3>The petitioners object to the DOC decision to combinethe commission offset with the ESP offset. They argue that andSection; 353.15(c)provides that the commissions given in one market and not the other maybe offset by actual ``other selling expenses'' incurred in the other market.The petitioners claim that ``other selling expenses'' only includes salesmen'ssalaries, bonuses, and similar selling functions, whereas the ESP offsetpermits the inclusion of all actual selling expenses. Therefore, salesmen'ssalaries should be segregated from indirect selling expenses and comparedto commissions.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. We have applied the same methodologyin this review as we used in the previous review. For our position on thismatter, see Comment 3 of our final results of the second administrativereview (51 FR 41365 (1986)). <T3>Comment 33: </T3>The petitioners urge the Department to offset theaverage duration of accounts receivable by the average duration of accountspayable. They state that the purpose of the imputed credit formula is toapproximate each respondent's working capital needs, while it carries itsaccounts receivable. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree for the reasons stated in our finalresults of the previous review. (See Comment 7, 51 FR 41365 (1986).) <T3>Comment 34: </T3>The petitioners argue that the cost accounting systemDaewoo used at its factory to allocate costs to individual products canlead to distortions because it does not take into consideration differencesin manufacturing resources required, such as labor time, in the productionof each product. Further, the petitioners suspect that Daewoo's cost of production is understatedbecause it does not include production engineering costs which generallyrelate to implementing the design and technological changes of Daewoo'sproducts.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree that Daewoo's methodology for allocatingcosts is inappropriate. Daewoo uses an accepted cost accounting systemfor goods produced in an assembly-line fashion. Further, differences inmanufacturing resources, such as labor hours, are recognized in Daewoo'scalculation of standard costs. Therefore, we see no reason to require Daewooto make additional adjustments for differences in manufacturing resources.Concerning engineering costs, we are not aware of any evidence to indicatethat Daewoo has excluded those costs from its cost of production calculation.<T3>Comment 35: </T3>The petitioners are concerned that Daewoo's intra-companytransfers of products do not reflect the fully-absorbed cost of production.Further, the petitioners believe that Daewoo's allocation of materialsand labor costs will not reflect the actual costs for each model. Theyargue that distortions in the allocations will be eliminated if price andefficiency variances are calculated for each model under review.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Daewoo stated in its cost of production responsethat its transfer prices of these products include the cost of parts, laborand factory overhead. Such a statement indicates that Daewoo has in factcalculated a fully-absorbed cost of production for these semi-manufacturedparts.We do not regard the recognition of costs and calculation of varianceson a model-by-model basis to be a requirement of all generally acceptedcost accounting systems. The creation of such variances when models shareproduction facilities, while desirable, would be artificial absent a pre-existingmethod of associating actual costs with specific models. Daewoo's costsystem does not have that ability.<T3>Comment 36: </T3>The petitioners object to Daewoo's removal of profitincluded in the parts Daewoo purchases from Orion Electric Co. They arguethat if, as Daewoo claims, its purchases of parts from Orion are at anarm's length price there is no reason for the Department to back out anamount for profit for those parts.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree. However, the petitioners are mistakenin their belief that the Department has accepted Daewoo's removal of profitfrom parts. For our preliminary determination, we added back the profitDaewoo had stripped out.<T3>Comment 37: </T3>The petitioners are concerned that Daewoo has notaccurately accounted for indirect labor costs in its calculation of totallabor costs for the cost of production. Because wage rates differ, basedon skills and seniority, Daewoo's allocation of indirect labor costs shouldbe based on direct labor man-hours and not on direct labor costs. Further,the petitioners believe that a manufacturer considers the time its workersspend actually working, plus the time they are physically at the plantearning wages, in calculating its total labor costs. Therefore, the petitionersurge the Department to confirm that these labor costs are included in thecost of production calculations.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree that Daewoo's allocation of indirectlabor costs is not based on man-hours. To allocate its indirect labor costs,Daewoo used standard man-hours for each model as a percentage of totalman-hours, and then applied that percentage to its actual labor cost. Weconsider Daewoo's methodology to be a reasonable one, and we do not considerthat this methodology has created any distortions in the allocation ofindirect labor costs.Concerning Daewoo's inclusion of workers' downtime in the cost of production,we have no evidence to indicate that Daewoo has not included those costsin its calculation of total labor costs. Normally, labor cost is basedon payroll, and this includes both productive and non-productive time.Nothing indicates Daewoo reduced its labor cost by non-productive hoursbefore allocation.<T3>Comment 38: </T3>The petitioners argue that Daewoo should expense itsResearch and Development (``Randamp;D'') costs during the review period inaccordance with the generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'')in the United States and not in accordance with the ``GAAP'' in Korea whichallows for the amortization of Randamp;D costs.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Because Daewoo is a Korean-based company, it isobligated to follow the Korean GAAP for its financial statements. We considerthis to be an acceptable practice and we do not find that the amortizationof Randamp;D has distorted Daewoo's expenses.<T3>Comment 39: </T3>The petitioners urge the Department to reject Daewoo'scalculation of the GSandamp;A allocation percentage used in the test forbelow-cost sales. The methodology is incorrect because these cost of productionexpenses are allocated using net dealer sales, which is a revenue element.Daewoo should allocate the expenses using cost of goods sold so that acost element will be allocated over a similar unit of measure.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree and have revised the SGandamp;A expense calculationsaccordingly.<T3>Comment 40:</T3> The petitioners comment that Daewoo should includebad debt in its cost of production They note that Daewoo excluded bad debtfrom GSandamp;A in its cost of production calculations because under Koreantax law, the expense cannot be deducted for five years. However, in Daewoo'sincome statement, gross profit was reduced by an amount for ``provisionfor doubtful accounts.'' Daewoo cannot have it both ways. Further, becauseU.S. GAAP requires that bad debt be recognized as a reduction in incomeonce the account is determined to be uncollectable, the Department shouldinclude the bad debt expense in Daewoo's GSandamp;A for the calculation ofcost or production.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> Concerning expenses that are appropriately includedin the cost of production, we adhere to our position in the first administrativereview (49 FR 50420, Comment 32). In that determination we stated thatthe fact that a particular adjustment is not applicable in a foreign marketvalue calculation does not necessarily mean that no expense was incurred.In some instances an expense is incurred in the manufacturing process,and therefore is included in the cost of production, but is not allowableas a circumstance of sale adjustment to FMV.In its decision not to include bad debt in its cost of production, Daewoocites a determination in the second administrative review in which we statedthat only those expenses which we have allowed as adjustments to FMV shouldbe included in the calculation of cost of production (49 FR 41365, Comment109). Upon further review, we realize that our statement was too broadlyworded. In the situation to which this comment referred, we were unableto detemine at verification if the expense was actually incurred. If wecannot determine that an expense was actually incurred, we do not makean adjustment to FMV and do not include the amount in the cost of production.In reference to Daewoo, its financial statements indicate that it did incurbad debt expenses during the review period. According to the Commerce Department's<T3>Study of Antidumping Adjustments Methodology and Recommendations forStatutory Change</T3> (``Adjustments Study''), bad debt incurred on earliersales of the merchandise under consideration, but written off during thereview period, is an indirect selling expense. Because Daewoo did not demonstratethat its bad debt was incurred on sales of color televisions, we cannotallow it as an indirect selling expense. However, Daewoo's bad debt isa general expense and should be included in the Gandamp;A expenses in thecost of production. We have amended or calculations accordingly.<T3>Comment 41: </T3>The petitioners contend that Daewoo incorrectly calculatedits net financing cost for the cost of production by subtracting both long-and short-term interest income from its total interest expense. Only short-terminterest income should be subtracted from total financing expenses.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree with the petitioners that only short-terminterest income should be subtracted from Daewoo's total financing cost.Long-term interest expense is considered to be a general administrativeexpense. It is appropriate to offset financing expenses with short-terminterest income because only short-term interest income is considered tobe earned from operational activities such as managing revenue from currentsales. Long-term interest income ordinarily results from investment activitieswhich are not related to production or sales, and therefore should notoffset interest expenses derived from production or sales activities.However, we did not deduct short-term interest income from Daewoo's totalfinancing expense as noted in its financial statement because Daewoo didnot separately identify long- and short-term interest elements as was requestedin section D.5 of the questionnaire. Therefore, we have used Daewoo's totalinterest expense from its financial statement in our cost of productioncalculations.<T3>Comment 42:</T3> The petitioners argue that Daewoo understates itsGandamp;A expenses for cost of production by not including its goodwill expenses.These expenses should be included in Daewoo's Gandamp;A because they providea direct benefit to Daewoo in the manufacturing and selling of its products.Moreover, the petitioners argue that the Department incorrectly revisedDaewoo's Gandamp;A allocation by multiplying total Gandamp;A by the ratio ofnet sales to cost of goods sold. The Department should instead multiplyDaewoo's total Gandamp;A expenses by the ratio of cost of goods sold of thecolor televisions under review to Daewoo's total cost of goods sold.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree that in this case goodwill expenses shouldbe included in Daewoo's Gandamp;A. Absent any information on the record indicatingthat Daewoo's goodwill should not be included in our calculations, we haveincluded a portion of the goodwill listed in Daewoo Electronic's incomestatment in the cost of production calculation.Concerning the basis for allocation of Daewoo's Gandamp;A expenses, in theabsence of more detailed cost information for televisions, we have usedDaewoo Electronic Co.'s ratio of net sales to cost of goods sold as bestinformation. We consider the ratio of sales to cost of sales for DaewooElectronics to be reasonable as the best information available becausetelevision sales account for a significant part of its total sales of allproducts.<T3>Comment 43:</T3> The petitioners note that Daewoo holds stock in adelivery company in Korea. They argue that if Daewoo employs this companyto deliver color televisions to its unrelated customers, Daewoo's homemarket freight costs should be treated as overhead expenses.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We note that Daewoo does hold stock in a deliverycompany. However, in the prior review we determined that Daewoo also employsother delivery companies to deliver color televisions. Further, we arenot aware of any evidence to indicate that this delivery company's chargesto Daewoo are not at arm's length. Therefore, we determine that it is appropriateto include those costs with the freight costs from unrelated delivery companiesin our final analysis.<T3>Comment 44:</T3> The petitioners argue that Daewoo's home market indirectselling expense claim, based on the number of employees in its domesticsales division, appears to be quite high when considering that the Seoulheadquarters staff is also responsible for serveral corporate functionsother than sales. Further, in order for Daewoo's indirect selling expenseclaim to reflect Daewoo's color television sales to total sales, the allocationshould be made on the basis of the relative sales value of the televisionsunder review over total domestic electronic product sales.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We have accepted Daewoo's allocation of its indirectselling expenses because it is consistent with Daewoo's past methodologywhich was verified and accepted by the Department in the previous review.Concerning Daewoo's allocation ratio based on the number of employees inits Domestic Sales Division, we have no evidence on the record to indicatethat the claimed number of employees is incorrect.<T3>Comment 45:</T3> The petitioners contend that while Daewoo calculatedits U.S. credit claim using the Federal Reserve short-term prime interestrate, its actual interest income, as listed in its financial statement,differs from the Reserve rate. Petitioners argue that unless Daewoo canexplain this inconsistency in data, the Department should use Daewoo'sactual interst rate in the calculation of its U.S. credit claim.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree with the petitioners and have calculatedDaewoo's U.S. credit claim using the interest rate noted in the financialstatements. It is the purpose of the credit calculation to approximateas accurately as possible the manufacturers' actual experience. Therefore,whenver possible we use respondents' actual cost of financing. If thatrate is not known, we use the Federal Reserve short-term prime interestrate as best information available.<T3>Comment 46:</T3> The petitioners question Daewoo's claimed credit periodfor U.S. sales. They state that the direct costs on PP sales should bebased on the period from time of shipment from Korea to the time Daewooreceives payment from its customers. The petitioners argue that it is unreasonablefor Daewoo to report a payment date which precedes the date which the customerreceived the merchandise. The petitioners maintain that the payment periodsused to calculate the accounts receivable turnover ratio for Daewoo's U.S.subsidiary, (Daewoo Electronics Co. of America (``DECA'')), do not coincidewith its financial statements and therefore grossly understate the creditexpense claim.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree with the petitioners that it is unreasonableto report payment before receipt of goods. Payment terms differ on a sale-by-salebasis, and in fact, when a letter of credit is involved, as is this situation,the manufacturer often receives payment from the customer before deliveryof the merchandise. Therefore, we did not alter Daewoo's reported paymentperiods.In its calculation of the accounts receivable period for ESP sales, DECAused net sales and average accounts receivable only for the month in whichthe ESP sales were made. Because DECA has claimed a credit expense on asale-by-sale basis for PP sales, it would then be double-counting its creditexpenses if it used those sales to calculate an imputed credit claim forESP sales.Therefore, we consider DECA's calculation of its accounts receivable turnoverratio to be a reasonable estimation of its credit expense on ESP sales.<T3>Comment 47:</T3> The petitioners argue that Daewoo should calculateits return loss claim on a model-by-model basis and not average the expenseover sales of all models. In addition, Daewoo should include in its returnloss claim the costs it incurred in reworking the returned set, and anyfreight expenses for the return of the set to Daewoo.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree that Daewoo's averaging of its return lossexpenses is inappropriate if the information to calculate a model specificclaim is available. We have recalculated Daewoo's claim on a model-by-modelbasis using the average loss amount as a percentage of sales of each model. We agree with the petitioners that, in theory, costs incurred in reworkingreturned merchandise and any freight expenses should be included in thereturn loss claim. Commonly, these expenses are included as part of thewarranty and freight claims for U.S. sales. We consider this to be thecase for Daewoo since Daewoo is unable to identify its returns on a transaction-specificbasis.<T3>Comment 48: </T3>The petitioners argue that Daewoo's home market indirectadvertising claim is inadequate because it does not reflect the relativesales weight of each of Daewoo's product lines. It should be allocatedusing the ratio of color television sales over Daewoo's total sales value.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree and have recalculated Daewoo's home marketindirect advertising claim to better reflect the value of its color televisionsales relative to the sales of all its products.<T3>Comment 49: </T3>The petitioners contend that the Department shouldonly use Gold Star's home market sales to retail stores in the final analysis.They argue that sales to ``collective end-users'' (hospitals and hotels,and tax-free sales to military px's and Korean construction workers) arenot in the ordinary course of trade and should not be used to establishthe FMV or to test for sales below-cost.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> While these sales are in the ordinary course oftrade, sales to military exchanges, hospitals and hotels, and Korean constructionworkers are not at the same level of trade as television sales to distributors,franchise stores, department stores or buying groups for resale to theend-user in the home market. Because sales to ``collective end-users''are at a different level of trade from the U.S. sales, we have disregardedthese sales in our calculation of home market price.<T3>Comment 50: </T3>The petitioners contend that Gold Star's short-termloans from related companies should be excluded from its home market creditclaim. Because these loans are related-company transactions, any profitrealized by one entity is passed on to all related parties.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree that Gold Star's loans from relatedcompanies should be excluded from the credit calculations. Because GoldStar's loans come from several sources, at a variety of interest rates,we consider the best estimate of the cost of funds to Gold Star is theweighted-average of its loans from all sources. Further, we did not findthe terms of the loans from related parties to differ significantly fromthe loans of other, unrelated, lending institutions that Gold Star used.Therefore, we have not altered Gold Star's home market claim.<T3>Comment 51: </T3>Gold Star has consistently used a lag period in salesfor the calculation of its U.S. warranty claim. Gold Star has relied ona study which determined that, on average, a certain number of months elapsebetween the sale of the television and any warranted repair. However, GoldStar has not relied on a similar study in the calculation of its home marketwarranty claim. The petitioners argue that Gold Star should employ thesame methodology in the calculation of warranty claims in both markets.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree that Gold Star's U.S. warranty methodologygives it any advantage in the calculation of margins because it has beenconsistent in its approach, and because there have been no significantchanges in its sales. Gold Star has used the same methodology for all administrativereviews. Each administrative review in this case starts at the time theprevious review ends. Therefore, we only look at the expenses and saleswithin that time period. We consider this consistency to be important becauseas long as the expense is allocated over the same time period, the salesvolume during that period will bear the expenses incurred during that sameperiod. Therefore, we consider Gold Star's home market and U.S. warrantyexpenses to have been captured for this review period.<T3>Comment 52: </T3>The petitioners claim that the Department failed tomake an adjustment for certain postage expenses Samsung incurred in itsdirect purchase price transactions.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We consider this expense to be a general expenseincurred on U.S. sales and we have included it in Samsung's export sellingexpense total.<T3>Comment 53:</T3> The petitioners comment that the Department has understatedthe imputed credit expense for Samsung's indirect purchase price sales.They argue that, if the Department intends to treat these sales as purchaseprice transactions, the credit expense for those sales should be calculatedbased on the time period from the date of shipment in Korea to date ofpayment by the U.S. customer. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree and have adjusted Samsung's U.S. creditclaim accordingly. <T3>Comment 54:</T3> The petitioners state that the Department should usebest information available for Samsung's cash discounts for early paymentand for deduction from invoice (``DFI'') advertising in the calculationof U.S. price. They argue that the DFI and cash discount claims shouldbe made on a sale-by-sale, or customer-by-customer basis. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> Samsung allocated its claims for cash discountsand DFI advertising over sales of all products because it grants thesediscounts on sales of all products. However, because these discounts arespecific to individual sales transactions, we have treated these claimsas adjustments to gross price for our final results. <T3>Comment 55:</T3> The petitioners claim that the Department should nothave accepted Samsung's U.S. freight allowance claim because the allocationmethodology produces an amount to be applied to USP which is lower thanthe minimum discount given. The Department should reject Samsung's claimunless it resubmits the claim on a per-sale or per-customer basis. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> In its questionnaire response, Samsung indicatedits U.S. subsidiary, SEA, knows on a sale-by-sale basis whether freightto the customer was included in the invoice price. Therefore, we concludethat SEA is able to identify on a per-sale or per-customer basis whethera freight allowance was given. We agree with the petitioners that Samsungshould not be allowed to allocate an expense over U.S. sales which it isable to identify on a more specific basis. In the absense of sale- or customer-specificexpenses, we have assumed, as best information available, that the highestpercent-discount SEA offers was granted on sales which have freight-outcharges and have deducted that amount from USP as best information available.<T3>Comment 56:</T3> The petitioners claim that Samsung has overstatedits home market credit claim. Samsung took account of the fact that theamount of taxes included in the sales price is not payable on the dateof invoice. However, the petitioners note that Samsung did not accountfor reductions to distributors' account balances when SYPM rebates weregranted on those sales. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree that Samsung's credit claim should reflectany reductions to distributors' account balances for rebates. For our position,see Comment 3. <T3>Comment 57:</T3> The petitioners argue that the Department incorrectlyallowed a portion of Samsung's differences in merchandise adjustment tobe based on the ``quality of raw material'' used in Samsung's cabinets.Unless the quality difference stems from an actual physical differencein the merchandise, the Department should deny Samsung's claim. <T3>DOC Position:</T3> We disagree. Because there is no evidence on therecord in this proceeding on which to conclude that the ``quality difference''in raw materials is not due to an actual physical difference in the materialsSamsung uses, we have accepted Samsung's physical difference claim. <T3>Comment 58: </T3>For this review period, Samsung revised its methodologyfor calculating home market and U.S. warranty and return loss adjustmentsfrom the methodology it used in the previous administrative reviews. Inall prior reviews Samsung allocated its review-period U.S. and home marketwarranty and return loss expenses over sales made during the same reviewperiod. For this review period, however, Samsung argues that because itsU.S. sales of Korean-made televisions have dropped significantly, the allocationof current expenses over the lower volume of current sales would unfairlyoverstate the expense to be applied to those sales. A ratio of review-periodexpenses to review-period sales is only appropriate as long as the salesvolume remains stable. However, during the third review, the sales of Samsung'sKorean-produced sets did not remain stable; in fact, they dropped precipitouslywhile at the same time sales of its American subsidiary-produced CTVs increasedsubstantially. To avoid an overstatement of expenses due to the precipitous decline insales, Samsung suggests two possible alternative methodologies which wouldmore accurately estimate the warranty expenses for this review period.First, Samsung suggests that its warranty expenses be allocated over athree year sales average. Samsung argues such a methodology is reasonablebecause there is a natural time-lag between sales and warranty expensesincurred on those sales. Alternatively, Samsung suggests that its warrantyexpenses be allocated over the combined sales of its Korean- and Americansubsidiary-produced sets for this review period. This methodology recognizesthe reason for the significant decline in Samsung's Korean-produced sets(assembly operations being shifted to its American subsidiary), yet permitsthe allocation of expenses over sales of the same review period. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>As we stated in our <T3>Adjustments Study</T3> (November 1985, page 49), we use warranty costsincurred during the review period or a longer historical period as thebest information available for the eventual warranty costs for the salesunder consideration. Thus, for Samsung to change its methodology to a rollingthree-year average is inappropriate because it will allow current warrantyand return loss expenses to go unaccounted for on actual sales since currentyear expenses were not actually deducted from prices of prior year salesin prior reviews. However, given the unique circumstances involving theprecipitous decline in sales of Samsung's Korean-produced CTVs, some changein methodology is warranted in order to avoid overstating the estimatedwarranted expenses that would result from using our normal methodology.We agree that Samsung's alternative methodology of allocating warrantyexpenses over the combined sales of its Korean- and American subsidiary-producedCTVs for this review period provides the best reasonable alternative fordetermining the most accurate estimate of its warranty and return lossexpenses for this review period. The advantage of this alternative is thatit conforms with our normal methodology of allocating review-period expensesto review-period sales. Further, this alternative is in keeping with ourprior determination that Samsung's Korean-produced CTVs are essentiallythe same as those assembled by its American subsidiary from picture tubesand printed circuit boards imported from Korea. <T3>See</T3> Final Results of Changed Circumstances Review and DeterminationNot to Revoke Antidumping Duty Order; Color Television Receivers from Korea,52 Fed. Reg. 24500 (July 1, 1987).<T3>Comment 59:</T3> Sumsung argues that the Department should comply withthe previous administrative reviews of this order and treat return lossas an indirect selling expense.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. In the home market we treat a returnloss expense as a circumstance of sale adjustment when the respondent isable to show on a model-by-model basis that the returns were the resultof sales made during the review period. Respondents incur a return lossexpense when a television is returned to the manufacturer as defectiveand resold at a loss. This expense is incurred only if an initial saleis made and the merchandise returned. Therefore, it is directly relatedto sales and is allowable as a circumstance of sale adjustment.The nature of the return loss expense incurred on U.S. sales is no differentfrom that incurred on home market sales. It is an expense which resultsfrom an initial sale. As respondents were able to identify the expense,we made deduction from USP. This treatment is consistent with our treatmentof this claim in the home market.<T3>Comment 60:</T3> Samsung argues that the Department should allow itshome market Shin Yong Pan Mae (SYPM) rebate program as a circumstance ofsale adjustment. Samsung notes that the Department has treated this claimas an indirect selling expense in prior reviews because the exact amountof the rebate attributable to sales during the review period cannot beknown until after the review period. Samsung reasons that it is often thecase that the rebate is not known until after the end of the review period.Whether or not the rebated amount is known before the review period ends,this rebate is a variable expense and should be treated as a circumstanceof sale adjustment.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree with Samsung that the amount of a rebateis often not known until after it is granted. The purpose of Samsung'sSYPM rebate program is to assume some of its distributor's costs on creditsales. For this reason, it is allowable as an adjustment in our antidumpinganalysis.However, the SYPM rebate program is not allowable as a circumstance ofsale adjustment because Samsung cannot identify the rebate on a model specificbasis. It is important that Samsumg be able to identify the expense model-by-modelbecause CTVs with different screen sizes will have differing credit experiences.As we state in Comment 67 of this notice concerning Gold Star's rebateprogram, large CTVs, unlike small screen CTVs, are more likely to be soldon credit. Therefore, our calculation of the FMV on a model-by-model basiswill be distorted if we accept an allocation of this expense based on creditsales of all size CTVs. It is not adequate that Samsung identify the rebateexpense distributor-by-distributor because we do not calculate the FMVon that basis. However, because Samsung can identify the expense on CTVs,we have allowed the rebate as an indirect expense in our calculations.<T3>Comment 61:</T3> Samsung argues that under section 772(c) of the statute,the Department cannot adjust for selling expenses relating to ESP sales,which are incurred in the home market, as indirect selling expenses. Samsungreaons that the Department does not have the authority to make the adjustmentbecause the expenses incurred by Samsung in Korea are not ``incurred byor for the account of the exporter in the United States''.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>In accordance with section 772(e)(2) of the Act,we only require that the expenses be incurred on behalf of the exporterwho is in the United States. For our position on this matter, see our finalresults of the second administrative review (51 FR 41365 (1986), Comment117), and <T3>Silver Reed </T3>v. <T3>United States</T3>, Slip Op. 88-37 (CIT Mar. 18, 1988).<T3>Comment 62:</T3> Gold Star argues that the Department should granta circumstance of sale adjustment to its FMV for the cash discounts grantedto its home market customers. These discounts are given on the basis ofearly payment for purchases, and therefore are directly related to sales.Gold Star explains that at the time of payment for mechandise, it creditsthe customer's account for the amount of the discount and the payment forthe goods. Therefore, the right to receive a discount occurs on a sale-by-salebasis. Gold Star claims that it does not keep a record of discounts grantedon specific sales but that the nature of the discount is not altered becausethe expense has been allocated over total sales to each customer.<T3>DOC Postition:</T3> We agree with Gold Star that its cash discountshould be treated as a reduction in price. We have amended our calculationsaccordingly.<T3>Comment 63:</T3> Gold Star argues that the Department should use thecomputer tape submitted in April, 1987 containing ESP sales and expensedata that correct certain ``clerical and programming errors'' found onthe tape submitted in August, 1986.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> Gold Star submitted this corrected tape prior tothe publication of our preliminary results. However, we did not use thistape for our preliminary determination because the petitioners had notyet had an opportunity to comment on the revised data. We consider thatGold Star has truthfully accounted for its mistakes and has accuratelyreported the expense items, and neither the petitioners nor Zenith havegiven us any reason to doubt the revised data. Therefore, we have usedthe April ESP data in our final results.<T3>Comment 64: </T3>Gold Star objects to the Department's applicationof its ``90/10'' rule in determining which home market sales to disregardin the calculation of foreign market value. Gold Star argues that the ``90/10''rule violates the terms set out in section 773(b) of the Act because itfails to measure whether Gold Star's home market ``prices permit the recoveryof all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course oftrade.'' Gold Star instructs the Department to follow the criteria setforth in <T3>Toho Titanium Co., Ltd. v. United States, </T3>11 CIT <T2>XX</T2>, 657 F. Supp. 1280, 1286 (1987), (``Toho'').<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Our determination in this case is not effected by<T3>Toho </T3>which is subject to remand and therefore is not a final decision.In our analysis of Gold Star's below-cost sales, we excluded below-costsales of model CN-0611 because more than ten percent of its sales weremade below its cost of production, over an extended period of time. Foran explanation of why we excluded certain sales of model CNR-842KZ fromour analysis, see Comment 31.<T3>Comment 65: </T3>Gold Star states that the Department should not makea circumstance of sale adjustment for royalty expenses in the calculationof FMV and USP. According to the Department's recent LTFV final determinationin fresh cut flowers from Colombia (52 FR 6842 (1987)), and Gold Star'saccounting procedures, royalties are properly treated as a cost of productionand not as a circumstance of sale adjustment.However, if the Department continues to adjust FMV for royalty expenses,Gold Star contends that the Department should use the ESP royalty claimGold Star originally submitted. Gold Star explains that the Department'srecalculation of its royalty claim in the preliminary determination misconstruesGold Star's royalty expense allocation.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The treatment of royalties as a cost of manufacturein our investigation of cut flowers from Colombia was based on the specificfacts of that investigation. We do not consider a similar treatment ofGold Star's royalty expenses to be appropriate. Gold Star's royalty obligationis based on the televisions to be sold in the home market or exported forsale in the U.S. If Gold Star's expenses are based on the televisions itmanufactures, rather than on the number and destination of sales, it hasnot adequately demonstrated that fact. Therefore, we will continue to deductroyalty expenses from the FMV.Concerning our recalculation of its ESP royalty claim, we agree with GoldStar that our revision was inappropriate. Because Gold Star based its claimon its actual royalty expenses, we consider an allocation based on actualsales and expenses to be reasonable. Therefore, in our final calculationswe have applied Gold Star's original claimed adjustment.<T3>Comment 66: </T3>Gold Star comments that for the final determination,the Department should use the revised home market sales information thatGold Star submitted in February, 1987. This computer tape eliminates allreturns and contains the proper number of home market observations.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Gold Star has adequately accounted for its returnedmerchandise in its February, 1987 tape, and we have used that tape forour final calculations.<T3>Comment 67: </T3>Gold Star argues that the Department should allowits home market rebate as a circumstance of sale adjustment. The rebateexpense bears a direct relationship to the sales under consideration andis a difference in circumstance of sale because the comparable U.S. salesare not subject to or eligible for this rebate.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree with Gold Star that the characteristicsand quantification of its rebate warrant its treatment as a circumstanceof sale in the FMV. First, we should clarify our position in the previousreview concerning this rebate. In Comment 107 of the final results of thesecond administrative review (51 FR 41377), we incorrectly stated thatwe had accepted Gold Star's revised claim because we were able to verifythe expenses. In Korea, we were able to verify that Gold Star could identifythe total rebated amount and the total television sales which had qualifiedfor the rebate. However, Gold Star could not identify the rebate on a saleby sale basis. In Comment 111 of the final results of the second administrative review,we stated that were were unable to verify the expense amounts. Our reasoningin Comment 111 was broadly stated and should be clarified. Because GoldStar granted the same rebate for televisions and other items, it couldnot identify the actual amount paid for color televisions alone. To reachan estimate of its CTV expenses, Gold Star allocated the total rebate expensebased on the ratio of CTV sales to total sales. However, an allocationof the total expense over CTV sales assumes that the rebate experienceis the same for all goods for which the rebate was granted. Such an assumptionis not valid because the rebate is based on the sale of a television oncredit, and the credit experience varies among different screen sizes.Further, Gold Star cannot identify its expenses on a model-by-model basis.Therefore, for our previous review, we still found Gold Star's claim tobe deficient, and we allowed the expense only as an indirect selling expense.The amount of a rebate expense depends on the incidence of the dealer'stime payment sales. Smaller screen sizes are generally less expensive andmay not as often require an extension of credit, while sales of largerscreen sizes will more likely require an extension of credit, and willmore often receive a rebate. Therefore, we consider Gold Star's abilityto identify a rebate on a model-by-model basis to be an important requirementfor the treatment of this expense as a circumstance of sale. In this third administrative review, Gold Star has not indicated that ithas altered its methodology from the previous review, or that it can nowidentify the rebate expense on a model-by-model basis. Therefore, we havetreated this expense as an indirect selling expense in the calculationof the FMV. We do not question the existence of the rebate; we simply cannotapply it with sufficient specificity to sales of particular models to makea direct adjustment to the price of those sales. <T3>Comment 68: </T3>Gold Star argues that the Department erred in denyingcertain home market warranty expenses as circumstance of sale adjustments.Specifically, four categories should be allowed as directly related tothe FMV because they are variable in nature and they relate directly torepairs. These categories include: service car operating costs, expensesfor travel, communications, and overtime pay expenses. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>For our position concerning directly related warrantyexpenses, see Comment 109 of our final results of the second administrativereview (51 FR 41365 (1986)). We do not consider the expenses included inthe four categories mentioned above to be directly related to repairs.Further, Gold Star has not provided information which ties its expensesfor travel or service operating costs to specific repairs. The fact thatGold Star is billed for telephone calls made from its repair centers doesnot indicate that these calls can be tied to specific repairs. The communicationexpense essentially includes costs incurred in the normal conduct of business.Therefore, we have not allowed these warranty-related expenses as circumstanceof sale adjustments. <T3>Comment 69: </T3>Gold Star comments that the Department's decisionto average prices in the home market for purposes of calculating the FMV,while failing to average prices in the U.S. market for purposes of calculatingstatutory USP results in a distortion of dumping margins and is an abuseof the Department's discretion under the current antidumping law. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. Because of the significant volume andfrequency of price changes of Gold Star's home market sales, we have useda monthly weighted-average of those home market sales in accordance with19 U.S.C. 1677f-1. There was no need to employ similar averaging techniquesin regard to U.S. sales since that sales volume was much smaller. <T3>Comment 70: </T3>Gold Star requests that the Department exclude itsmodel RCV-0615, CTV and AM/FM radio, and model KMV-9002, videocassetterecorded and CTV, from the order. Gold Star argues that these units constitutecombinations of items that are not, and were never intended to be, encompassedin the Department's and International Trade Commission's original determinations.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We have received a number of requests for the clarificationof the scope of this order, and those on televisions from Taiwan and Japan,concerning televisions in combination with other consumer electronic items,such as radios, audio cassette players, clocks, and video casette playersand recorders. Before making further case-specific and model-specific decisions,we are soliciting comments from interested parties to assist us in developingoverall methodological guidelines. Forthwith, we will request commentsfrom the interested parties in the above-mentioned cases, on the generalmethodology to be followed for combination units. Accordingly, we are deferringour determination on the Gold Star models RCV-0615 and KMV-9002 until wereceive all comments.<T3>Comment 71: </T3>In its May 11, 1987 preliminary determination (52FR 17617), the Department included in the calculation of the FMV, Daewoo'shome market sales to military post exchanges and buying groups, Daewooemployees, and bonus sales to Daewoo Corporation employees. Daewoo arguesthat it is inappropriate and unwarranted to include its employee or otherspecial sales in the FMV calculations. The Daewoo employee sales are neitherin the usual wholesale quantities nor in the ordinary course of trade.The sales to Daewoo Corp. were related-company transactions and thereforethe prices are not at arm's length. Daewoo argues that the use of the salesto post exchanges and buying groups is also unprecedented and Daewoo hadnot provided transaction-specific adjustments for those sales. Additionally,most of these sales were sold subject to commissions that vary customerto customer, and the credit terms are different from dealer sales. Becausecalculating the adjustments for those sales would be costly and time consuming,Daewoo urges the Department to use only the dealer sales for calculatingthe FMV. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with Daewoo that sales to employees, militarypost exchanges, and Daewoo Corporation are at a different level of trade,and we have excluded these transactions in calculating FMV. As we statedin Comment 49, we have used home market sales to distributors, franchisestores, department stores and buying groups in our final analysis. We have included Daewoo's sales to its buying groups in the calculationof the FMV because these sales are made in the ordinary course of trade,at the same level of trade, and in the same commercial quantities as Daewoo'ssales to dealers. Because Daewoo neglected to include in its response anyadjustments to the FMV for its sales to buying groups, we have used Daewoo'sclaimed adjustments for its dealer sales as best information available.<T3>Comment 72: </T3>Daewoo argues that the Department did not correctlyadjust its home market sales prices for inland freight expenses. Daewoostates that the portion of the inland freight costs representing shipmentsfrom the warehouse to the customer should be treated as a circumstanceof sale adjustment because these expenses directly offset the price paidby the customer. All freight costs should be treated as direct expensesin the home market because on U.S. sales all freight charges are deductedwhether they occur before or after the sale. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>Our treatment of Daewoo's home market freight expensefrom the warehouse to the customer as an indirect expense was a clericalerror. We intended to treat this expense as a circumstance of sale adjustmentbecause a post-sale delivery to the customer is directly related to thatsale. We disagree that the freight expense from the factory to the warehousesis an expense which is directly related to any one sale. Daewoo inventoriesits merchandise in warehouses in anticipation of sales. Any freight coststo transport a television to the warehouses are incurred prior to a sale,not as the result of a sale. Therefore, we have treated freight expensesfrom Daewoo's factory to its warehouses as an indirect selling expense.<T3>Comment 73: </T3>Daewoo argues that the Department incorrectly treatedits March 1986 sales rebate program as an indirect selling expense. Thisrebate was a product-specific program and is analogous to a fall 1984 rebatethat the Department allowed as a direct selling expense in the previousadministrative review. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree. Our treatment of the March 1986 rebateprogram as an indirect selling expense was a clerical error. We have correctedour calculations for the final results. <T3>Comment 74: </T3>Daewoo argues that the Department erred in includingOrion Electric Co.'s profit from its sales of color picture tubes to Daewooin the cost of production calculations. Daewoo states that it is relatedto Orion within the meaning of section 773(e)(3)(E) of the Act. Therefore,Orion's profit should not be part of Daewoo's cost of producing the merchandiseunder section 773(b) of the Act. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. We consider Daewoo's transactions withOrion during the review period to have been made at the equivalent of arm'slength. Therefore, we have not revised our calculations from the preliminarydetermination. For our position on this matter, see Comment 36. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final results of the Review </ITAG>As a result of the comments received, we have revised our preliminary resultsand for appraisement purposes margins range from 0 to 49.08 percent, 0to 158.47 percent, 0 to 43.49 percent and 0 to 4.50 percent for Samsung,Gold Star, Daewoo, and Quantronics, respectively.
