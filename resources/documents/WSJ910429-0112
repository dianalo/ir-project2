Preliminary estimates by monitors of OPEC's output suggestwellhead production for this month may not average more than22 million barrels a day, compared with more than 23 millionbarrels in March.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There is definitely a drop in supplies from OPEC -- atleast 600,000 barrels a day,&quot; said Conrad Gerber, presidentof Petro-Logistics Ltd. In its tracking of these supplies,the Geneva concern includes the volumes of oil shipped out ofeach oil-exporting country, whether from storage or immediateproduction. But some other monitors of OPEC's oil output,which count wellhead production only, report that itapparently has fallen by more than the one million barrels aday that the oil ministers had agreed to cut voluntarily forthe second quarter.   Cristina Haus, who monitors OPEC's production forWashington-based Energy Security Analysis Inc., estimatesthat April output appears to be averaging only 21.6 millionbarrels a day. &quot;With Saudi Arabia accounting for most {cuts},that is down 1.5 million&quot; from her March estimate of 23.1million barrels a day, she said.   Whatever method is used to assess the crude-oil volumemade available by OPEC, the April level marks a surprisingturnabout from the monthly gains since last year's lowproduction of 20 million barrels a day in August. It alsosuggests some firming of oil prices, if only temporarily,once the reductions are publicized.   Still, a consensus seems to be developing among energyeconomists that the outlook for oil markets remainsrelatively weak and that any price upturn may be short-lived.World crude oil supplies are high despite the OPEC productioncutbacks, they say.   Additionally, reductions in North Sea production for fieldmaintenance aren't likely to be as large in the secondquarter as had been anticipated. Also, there are indicationsthat part of the production cutoff by the United Nationsembargo that followed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait may beresumed quicker than expected.   Iraq last week advised former oil customers by telex thatit expects to resume exports in this year's third quarter,according to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report. Such aresumption depends on repairs to the Iraqi oil installationsdamaged by the war. Also, there are political obstacles. Iraqmust win the permission of Turkey, and possibly Saudi Arabia,to reopen the oil pipelines across those countries as well asovercome the U.N. embargo.   &quot;The long-term price trend line&quot; for the basket of sevencrudes used to measure OPEC's oil prices, &quot;has shifteddownward by $3 to $5 per barrel,&quot; Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, chiefeconomist for Ashland Oil Inc., told a Boulder, Colo.,conference of the International Research Center for Energyand Economic Development last week. &quot;The new real{inflation-adjusted} price band,&quot; he added, &quot;is $15 to $20for the next 10 to 20 years.&quot;   Recent prices of such preferred crudes as West TexasIntermediate and Brentthe U.S. and North Sea benchmarks,respectively -- have been averaging between $19 and $21 abarrel. But OPEC's prices, as measured by the basket,generally lag behind these by $2 to $3 or more a barrel.Although OPEC has targeted a &quot;reference&quot; price of $21 abarrel, the actual price of the basket has averaged onlyslightly above $17 in recent weeks.   Some other economists and oil analysts consider Mr.Tahmassebi's price projections to be on the low side. Severalsaid, however, that his previous forecasts of recent yearsalso had been considered too pessimistic but had proved to bemore accurate than most others.   Whatever their differences over the long-term outlook,many economists support Mr. Tahmassebi's price picture atleast for the remainder of this year. Another speaker at theBoulder conference, Jack W. Wilkinson, chief economist of SunRefining andamp; Marketing Co., expects 1991 world oil demand torise slightly to 66 million barrels a day from 1990's 65.8million barrels a day.   Even so, Mr. Wilkinson predicted that oil prices willremain flat after inflation adjustments. He said West TexasIntermediate should average $20 a barrel this year andthrough 1995.</TEXT></DOC>
