In the 1987 third quarter, net was $2.8 million, or 23 cents a share.    Westwood, a leading producer and distributor of radio programming, blamed the lower earnings on a soft national advertising market and costs associated with restructuring its recently acquired NBC Radio Networks.    Revenue for the latest quarter rose 13%, to $27.1 million from $24 million.    For the nine months, Westwood posted net of $2.9 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with $7 million, or 57 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 42% to $84 million from $59.3 million.    In national over-the-counter trading, Westwood closed Friday at $11.25 a share, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
