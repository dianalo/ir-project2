(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A secret 1949 experiment at the Hanfordnuclear reservation released about twice as much radioactive gas asscientists had predicted beforehand, according to a newlydeclassified report.   The report said the so-called Green Run experiment releasedabout 7,780 curies of radioactive iodine and about 20,000 curies ofxenon-133, a gas.   By contrast, the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, the worstcommercial nuclear accident in the United States, emitted 15 to 24curies of radioactive iodine into the Pennsylvania countryside.   Scientists had estimated in 1949 that the test would releaseabout 4,000 curies of iodine and 7,900 curies of xenon. Theincreased radiation measurements may have been caused by anunstable weather inversion over the region, the report said.   The Spokane Chronicle and Spokesman-Review, two of severalnewspapers that requested the report's release, published detailsof its contents in articles Wednesday and today.   The Dec. 2, 1949 experiment, the only known non-accidentalrelease of radiation in Hanford's post-World War II history, spreadradiation in a 40-by 200-mile plume to Spokane and as far south asKlamath Falls, Ore., near the California border.   It's not known how much radiation residents actually wereexposed to, since the public was never notified and no follow-uphealth studies were done.   Scientists are now starting a study to see if Hanford emissionsin the 1940s and '50s, including the Green Run, have led to anincrease in thyroid disease in the area.   Some details of the Green Run test were included in a Hanfordnuclear reservation environmental monitoring report that was among19,000 pages of previously secret documents made public by theDepartment of Energy in 1986. But a more detailed 120-page reporton other aspects of the experiment was not released until thisweek. Some segments of the report were deleted for securityreasons, the government said.   The Green Run experiment was apparently conducted to helpdevelop efforts to detect emerging military plutonium production inthe Soviet Union. The contamination exceeded the Atomic EnergyCommission's ``tolerance thresholds'' for iodine-131 on vegetationby tens of thousands of times on the nuclear reservation and byhundreds of times in nearby communities.</TEXT></DOC>
