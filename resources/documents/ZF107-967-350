 There are three levels of informationtechnology strategies: level one is the external, which isconcerned with service delivery and client relations; level two isinternal, concerned with how the strategies affect theorganization and improve its external position; and level three isinfrastructure, the creation of which includes the informationtechnology management system.andP;  For effective management for the1990s, government agencies are urged to adhere to the 'strategictriangle' - alignment of strategy, agency structure andinformation technology.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Business PlanningManagement ScienceGovernment AgencyBooksInformation Resources ManagementStrategic Planning.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Agencies Should Make Room for Business StrategyandM;Peter Drucker's 1964 book on business strategies was published under thetitle Managing for Results.andP;  He originally wanted to name it BusinessStrategies but was dissuaded by those whose felt that strategy was a militaryconcept, not one that applied to business.andM;That seems a little strange when one considers that as early as 1837Washington Irving referred to &quot;the boasted strategy of the fur trade.&quot;andP;  Butthat was the conventional thinking in the 1960s.andM;The more traditional schools of business administration, such as the HavardBusiness School and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania,taught business strategy as part of business policy.andP;  This reflected thebusiness practice of trying out strategies by following policies thatdetermined how resources could achieve an organization's business objectives.andM;However, a few other schools taught business strategy as a separatediscipline.andP;  They included the Sloan School of Management at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology and the Graduate School for IndustrialAdministration at what is now Carnegie Mellon University.andP;  Those schools mayhave been influenced by the orientation toward quantitative methods that grewout of their faculties' interest in operations research for the military inWorld War II.andM;Strategic ReferenceandM;In an interesting wrinkle, Harvard professor Alfred Chandler had hisinfluential book, Strategy and Structure, published by the MIT Press in 1962.andM;Drucker acknowledged in a footnote in Managing for Results the &quot;stimulationand insights&quot; provided by Chandler's earlier book.andM;In the preface to the second edition of Managing for Results, Druckerexplained that the title &quot;expresses the book's premise: Businesses exist toproduce results on the outside, in the market and the economy.andP;  On the insidethere only costs.&quot;andM;That should have a familiar ring, if you read my last column on strategies.andO;It's what happens outside an organization that is important, not what affectsit internally only.andP;  That's why the reference to &quot;rearranging the chairs onthe deck of the Titanic&quot; is so sadly appropriate in far too many cases.andM;Drucker relegated the title, &quot;Business Strategies,&quot; to Chapter 13 of hisbook.andP;  Curiously, the word &quot;strategic&quot; appears only on the last two pages ofthat chapter where he discusses &quot;structure and strategy.&quot;andM;And nowhere is strategy defined.andP;  It's almost as though you are supposed tocome to it by osmosis.andP;  Yet after 25 years, it is the most widely used bookon the subject of business strategies.andM;Why?andP;  Because Managing for Results is a what-to-do book, &quot;practical ratherthan theoretical,&quot; as Drucker is pleased to point out.andP;  He describes it as&quot;the first to attempt an organized presentation of the economic tasks of thebusiness executive managing a business organization.&quot;andM;In the public sector, executives are rarely engaged in economic tasks.andP;  Butthe processes that Drucker describes can be applied in analogous ways.andP;  Ifyou haven't read the book, do.andM;Not only read it, but study it.andP;  No one is so divorced from what happens inthe economic sphere of our society that he cannot understand the lessonsDrucker tries to teach by the examples in the book.andP;  And Drucker is such anaccomplished writer that he usually succeeds.andM;In my next column I plan to discuss some of the issues involved in the how-tofacet of this subject.andP;  But for now I want to deal with the issue of whosejob it is to do strategic planning in an agency.andM;Unless there is a clear idea of who is responsible and why, the results, ifthere are any, will be haphazard at best.andP;  We can cite too many examples frompast experiences of federal agencies for this to be much of an argument.andM;Executive's FunctionandM;Strategic planning is a function that is uniquely that of the executive; itcannot be delegated.andP;  The executive is the one assigned the responsibilityfor achieving results from the resources put in in his charge.andM;And it is he who must decide on the organization's program for performance,its strategic plan.andP;  Remember the Greek words stratos, strategos andstratagema.andP;  They tell the whole story.andM;In our context the executive can be an agency program manager, an executivein charge of a functional area such as finance or personnel, or the senioragency official for information resources management.andP;  It is, therefore,useful to think of the agency's information technology strategies as existingon three levels.andM;Level 1, or external, strategies are the ones adopted by the program officersto have a significant impact on the value of the services to the agency'sclients.andP;  That is, they will enhance in a meaningful way the service deliveryfor the public good.andM;Level 2, or internal, strategies affect the agency internally but alsoimprove its external position.andP;  For example, these are the strategies of thefinance officer and personnel officer who want to enhance the value of theirservices to their agency clients.andM;Level 3, or infrastructure, strategies entail creating the informationinfrastructure, including the information technology management system thatwill facilitate the use of information technology within the agency.andM;This is the special province of the senior agency official for IRM.andP;  It is aparticularly pivotal role, because you cannot have a favorable climate forstrategic applications at the first and second levels unless you have a soundagency information technology management strategy.andM;Fitting Into the PictureandM;I have noted before that senior officials in agencies always have had aproblem fitting information technology into the bigger picture of an agency'smission and programs.andM;Much of the problem is the result of isolating broad agency program planningfrom information technology planning.andP;  That's a mistake.andM;To paraphrase the major conclusion of the Management in the 1990s researchprogram at the MIT to fit the federal scene:  Alignment of strategy, agencystructure and information technology is a key government management conceptfor the 1990s.andP;  This is the &quot;strategic triangle&quot;--the related factors thatneed to be managed together for success.andM;Senior government executives who set program strategies, line managers whooversee functional teams and IRM managers who provide information technologyleadership need to develop a common knowledge base and language.andM;The managers who abdicate their primary responsibility, which is to decidethe role they will play in the use of information technology in theirorganizations and how that role will fit into that of the other players,create the biggest problem.andM;Unfortunately, the information technologists who really understand thetechnology and the line managers who have the programmatic problems often donot understand and are not interested in learning each other's area ofexpertise.andM;Unless they do, they cannot exercise in a meaningful way theirresponsibilities for doing strategic planning for the organizations theymanage.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
