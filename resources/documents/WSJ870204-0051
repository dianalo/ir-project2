The strong economic statistics and the officials' comments should have sent the dollar higher. Instead, those factors merely lifted the currency from its lows of the day.    Dealers said trading, though active, was nervous and uncertain. Although market sentiment remained bearish for the dollar, traders were concerned that central banks may work together to break the currency's fall or that senior Western monetary officials will meet and decide on measures to bolster the unit.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8008 West German marks, down from 1.8090 marks the day before. The U.S. currency edged up to 152.60 yen from 152.59. The British pound rose to $1.5275 from $1.5203.    In what traders said was a continuation of Monday's correction -- which followed last Friday's surge -- the U.S. currency fell in Tokyo trading yesterday and dropped further in Europe.&quot;This morning the dollar traded as if Friday had never happened,&quot; said Jack Kessler, a vice president in charge of New York foreign-exchange operations for Chase Manhattan Bank. &quot;The effect of the stronger-than-expected trade number was reversed.&quot;    (On Friday, the Commerce Department reported a December U.S. trade deficit of $10.66 billion, much lower than market expectations. Reacting to that trade figure, the dollar climbed 2.3% against the mark on Friday, to 1.8328.)    The dollar then recovered slightly in late European and early New York trading yesterday following the release of strong U.S. economic statistics and a warning by a Swiss central bank official of possible coordinated central bank intervention to smooth markets and stem the dollar's decline.    The dollar made up more of its intra-day losses later in New York trading as dealers began to reassess the economic data.    Robert Cassidy, a vice president at Chemical Bank, said the dollar &quot;has had a good run around; it's a pretty nervous market.&quot;    The Commerce Department reported that its composite index of leading economic indicators rose 2.1% in December, following a revised 0.9% increase in November; the index is the government's main economic forecasting gauge. The department also said that new factory orders rose 1.2% in December, contrasted with a revised increase of 3.6% in November, and that sales of new single-family houses rose 12.7% in December, after a revised 1% increase the month before. All figures were higher than the market had expected.    Meanwhile, Marcus Lusser, a vice president of Switzerland's central bank, in a speech in West Germany, warned that &quot;a well-coordinated intervention by several central banks&quot; could follow last month's round of interest-rate cuts by the West German, Swiss and other European central banks.    In addition, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, at a meeting of business executives in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, denied that the dollar is in a free fall. But he declined to say what action, if any, would be taken to stabilize the unit. And in Brussels, Belgium, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter conceded that more dollar stability &quot;would be in the interests of expanding world trade.&quot;    Despite those comments, &quot;there's no real change in sentiment out there,&quot; said J. Thomas Stanley, a trader at Merrill Lynch International. &quot;You're just seeing profit-taking (from the dollar's earlier fall), if for no other reason than (traders) don't know where it's going to go tomorrow.&quot;    The impact of Mr. Lusser's comments, although limited, was surprising, because on Monday the market shrugged off warnings by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker that further dollar weakness could lead to renewed inflationary pressures. &quot;He's kind of lost his play,&quot; said Mr. Stanley. &quot;Had Baker said what Volcker said yesterday, the dollar would have been 10 pfennigs higher.&quot;    The comments and economic data weren't enough to give the dollar a net rise over Monday's late New York quotes, but they did help boost the dollar from its intra-day low of 1.7845 marks.    Even so, &quot;we should have gotten more mileage out of these numbers,&quot; said Leslie A. Puth, an assistant vice president at Credit Suisse in New York. &quot;It's pretty clear people don't want to hold onto dollars for too long.&quot;    Mr. Kessler of Chase said that &quot;where we go from here depends on whether central banks come in in support of the dollar. Otherwise, it looks like the market will keep testing the downside.&quot;    Some traders also continued to voice apprehension about how hungry foreign investors are for the $29 billion U.S. Treasury refunding that began yesterday. Even though the sale yesterday of $10 billion of three-year notes was relatively successful, dealers noted that foreigners, particularly Japanese investors, prefer longer-dated paper. The Treasury will sell $9.75 billion of 9 3/4-year notes today and another $9.25 billion of 29 3/4-year bonds tomorrow.    &quot;There's a lot of nervousness,&quot; said an economist at a major securities firm. He noted reports that Japanese insurance companies are diversifying their foreign investments by placing new funds into non-U.S. dollar securities. Also, many analysts still question whether the latest Washington-Tokyo statement on the dollar-yen exchange rate has any teeth.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 152.30 yen from 152.60 in New York yesterday afternoon.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery this month settled at $403.60 an ounce, up $2.50. Estimated volume was a heavy 4.1 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $403.55 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                       CURRENCY RATES                         New York   Home Mkt.
