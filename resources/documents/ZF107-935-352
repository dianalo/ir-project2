 The successful ones develop standards andsettle down.andP;  The lucky ones live to a ripe old age, retire, and are enjoyedby children.andM;Superspeed modems -- those operating at 9,600 bits per second (bps) andabove--have just reached adulthood.andP;  In their youth, they were wildlyextravagant, notoriously incompatible, and frequently finicky about how theywere treated.andP;  Only recently have they matured into a technology that'spractical, affordable, and easy to use.andM;A 9,600-bps modem has the same purpose as its slower relatives: to let yourcomputer communicate over the phone.andP;  Modems accomplish this by modulating,or transforming, your computer's digital signals into analog ones, which arethen transmitted across phone lines, bit by byte, as audible tones.andP;  At thereceiving end, another modem demondulates the signals, transforming them backinto digital data -- the 1s and 0s that are the building blocks of computercommunication.andP;  The term modem is an acronym for MOdulator-DEModulator (seethe &quot;How It Works&quot; sidebar).andM;One quirk of the early superspeed modems was their refusal to work overstandard dial-up telephone lines.andP;  They required specially tuned -- andspecially priced -- lines leased from the phone company.andP;  Over these nearlynoise-free lines, a 9,600-bps modem used a variety of digital tricks todouble its performance to a maximum of 19,200 bps.andM;Times have changed, and a hardier class of these high-tech wonders hasappeared.andP;  The newest superspeed modems are less affected by backgroundnoise, so they can communicate with each other over normal phone lines.andO;Their prices have also dropped substantially, bringing them within each ofaverage business users.andM;To assess the state of the art, MacUser Labs examined eleven 9,600-bps modemscosting less than $1,500, all of which adhere to the V.32 standard forsuperspeed telecommunications.andP;  Two of the modems -- the CONNECT V.32 Serviceand Racal-Vadic 9632VP -- are the same unit packaged with differentaccessories.andP;  Three others -- the Computer Friends LightSpeed, Digicom V.329624LE, and Prometheus ProModem 9600M Plus -- also use identical hardware.andO;The remaining six -- the Bytcom Strata V.32, FastComm FDX 9696, MultiTechMultiModem V32, NEC N9631, Telebit T2500, and U.S.andP;  Robotics Courier V.32 --exhibit numerous differences in both features and performance (see Table 1).andM;A superspeed modem is judged by how fast it can reliably transmit data overphone lines -- its throughput.andP;  Accordingly, we tested each modem's speed andits resistance to errors caused by noise on the phone line.andP;  The resultsconfirm that today's 9,600-bps modems are less finicky and more dependablethan their predecessors.andP;  Even large amounts of noise had little adverseeffect on most of them, and while none of the modems reached the ideal19,200-bps limit, several topped 15,000 bps in certain situations.andM;The Need for SpeedandM;At $800 to $1,500 each, the superspeed modems we tested are still costlyenough to make you think twice before buying.andP;  Before joining life in thefastest lane, you should consider your communications habits, the type andvariety of computers you connect with, and the kind of data you send andreceive.andM;The power of these modems is best for transmitting and receiving files, notfor interactive communication.andP;  A 9,600-bps modem is a blessing forprogrammers, desktop publishers, and others who must transfer huge files,because it's more than four times faster than a &quot;high-speed&quot; 2,400-bps modem.andO;But if you use your modem mostly for real-time typing to exchange informationwith other computer users, you don't need the power of a superspeed modem --unless you type 10,000 words per minute.andM;Another ideal use is remote-control communication.andP;  Applications such asFarallon's Timbuktu/Remote and Microcom's Carbon Copy Mac let you call adistant Mac by modem and operate it exactly as if it were your own (see&quot;Remote Control,&quot; May '89).andP;  Using a Mac by remote control is a boon toconsultants, who often need to access files and programs so they candetermine the cause of a problem or configure a system for a client.andO;Although you can use a slower modem for remote operations, you'll suffer adistinct performance loss, as if you were working in slow motion.andM;With the appropriate networking hardware and software, you can also use a9,600-bps modem to tap into a network from afar and access files andelectronic mail.andP;  To your Mac, it looks just like a hard-wired connection.andO;However, even though a 9,600-bps modem is vastly superior to slower modemsfor wide-area networking, you still won't achieve network speeds; evenslowpoke LocalTalk operates at 230,400 bps.andM;On the flip side, remember that it takes two to tango.andP;  A 9,600-bps modemwon't do you any good unless there's one on the other end of the line, andsuperspeed modems are still relatively rare.andP;  For instance, don't expect tohook up your new modem and immediately connect at super speed to yourfavorite on-line or bulletin-board service.andP;  With the exception of CONNECT,no major dial-up service can handle these speed-burners -- yet.andP;  ExpectCompuServe, Dow Jones, and other popular services to add 9,600-bps service asV.32 modems become more popular.andP;  But don't worry about losing touch withthese and other slowpokes, because all the modems we tested can downshift tocompatible speeds and do so automatically when they connect to a slowermodem.andM;Finally, don't expect to recoup your investment overnight with money you saveon your phone bill.andP;  A good 2,400-bps modem can be picked up for around $200-- one-fourth the cost of the cheapest superspeed modem.andP;  Your files will zipacross the country four times faster at 9,600 bps, but if you pay 25 centsper minute between San Francisco and New York, you'll have to save a lot ofquarters before you make up the difference.andM;Getting Up to SpeedandM;You can't just attach a 9,600-bps modem to your Mac and immediately reap thebenefits.andP;  For one thing, standard modem cables don't support hardwarehandshaking, which controls the flow of data between Mac and modem.andP;  Thiscapability is a requirement for superspeed communications (see the &quot;Glossary&quot;sidebar).andM;The Computer Friends and Prometheus modems include the properhardware-handshaking cable.andP;  Two others -- the CONNECT V.32 Service andRacal-Vadic 9632VP -- don't require you to modify your cable.andP;  Instead, youmake the necessary adjustment by sending a command to the modem through yourtelecommunications software.andP;  (The V.32 Service includes a cable that worksfine after this adjustment is made.)andP;  For the rest of the modems, you musteither find the correct cable or make a jumper cable (see this month's LabsBrief, &quot;ModemCable Rewiring&quot;).andM;Next make sure that the modem is configured correctly for your system.andP;  Thiswill probably mean going through the manual -- the FastComm FDX 9696 has anexcellent one -- to discover how to set the DIP (dual in-line package)switches on the back or bottom of your modem.andP;  Four of the modems can also beconfigured remotely, enabling you to set them up long-distance.andP;  But ifyou're setting up the modem in person, you'll be flipping DIPs to set suchthings as parity and start and stop bits.andP;  When you've finished, it's timefor the next step -- installing your favorite telecommunications application.andM;You'll need a program such as MicroPhone, Smartcom, or Red Ryder to managethe communications between Mac and modem and to access the Hayes Standard ATCommand Set built into the modem's ROM.andP;  Two of the modems include thenecessary software.andP;  Computer Friends LightSpeed comes bundled with QuickLink II, which has a text editor that lets you create and save any sequenceof passwords or log-on commands.andP;  When you launch Quick Link II, itautomatically configures your modem to the settings you previously definedand stored.andM;The ProModem 9600M Plus package from Prometheus Products includesMAcKNOWLEDGE, a powerful program that's smart enough to automaticallyconfigure all aspects of your modem for best performance on any line.andP;  One ofour favorite features is a built-in log of all access numbers for the majoron-line services -- just enter your area code, and a dialog box pops up withthe appropriate numbers.andM;Although it doesn't offer a full-fledged telecommunications program, theCONNECT V.32 Service includes Business Information Network software foraccessing CONNECT's on-line service.andP;  This may sound like a limitation, butthe fact that CONNECT throws in a free subscription to the service and onefree hour of connect time sweetens the deal considerably.andM;Now it's time to switch on your new modem and face its bwewildering array ofred lights.andP;  All the models have at least 8 LEDs (light-emitting diodes) asstatus indicators.andP;  A few, such as the FastComm, NEC, and U.S.andP;  Roboticsmodems, have as many as 12.andP;  While LEDs tell you instantly what the modem isdoing, they also make things look more complicated than they really are.andO;Except for the Connect and Speed indicators, you can basically ignore therest, because the telecommunications software should provide adequatefeedback about the progress and status of your calls.andP;  The other LEDs do comein handy, however, when you're troubleshooting a stubborn modem.andM;If you plan to use your modem not only to call others but also to allow themto call you, now's the time to implement password security, which preventsunauthorized callers from accessing your computer.andP;  Your telecommunicationsprogram can access the modem's security features to let you set passwords;check the modem's manual for the proper procedures.andP;  The FastComm FDX 9696has a simple but effective form of security -- the caller is prompted for apassword, and it it's wrong, the FDX 9696 modem simply hangs up.andP;  TheComputer Friends, Digicom, Multi-Tech, and Prometheus modems offer the doubleprotection of callback security.andP;  If the caller provides the correctpassword, your modem hangs up and calls the other modem back, using apreprogrammed telephone number.andM;As a last step, you may want to store commonly used phone numbers directly inyour new modem.andP;  The modems' storage capacities range from 4 (FastComm andU.S.andP;  Robotics) to 30 numbers (Bytcom).andP;  In any case, most telecommunicationsprograms provide all the on-disk number storage you need.andM;Meeting the StandardsandM;After you've finished getting the modem ready to go, you must find someone totalk to.andP;  Unfortunately, affordable 9,600-bps modems are still few and farbetween, and many don't conform to the V.32 standard followed by the modemswe tested.andM;V.32 is an indusrywide modulation standard established by the Geneva-basedInternational Consultative Committee for Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT) toensure compatibility among 9,600-bps modems.andP;  A V.32 modem can communicatewith other V.32 modems regardless of make or model.andP;  Superspeed modems thatdon't comply with V.32 may not be able to communicate with your new V.32modem.andP;  This is a minor consideration if you plan only to set up a privatehighspeed link, but iths a crucial concern if you want to communicate at9,600 bps with the rest of humanity.andP;  Don't assume that every 9,600-bps modemobeys V.32's rules.andP;  There are plenty of modems out there that don't, andmost of them are capable of communicating only with their own kind (see the&quot;Seeing Through the Hayes&quot; sidebar).andM;Most modems in use today comply with two aerlier standards: V.22bis, whichgoverns 2,400-bps modems, and Bell 212A, which provides guidelines for1,200-bps modems (see Table 2).andP;  There are even a few Bell 103 modems stillaround, which are chugging along at 300 bps.andP;  Because of this, all the modemsin this report automatically check the speed of the other modem in the linkand adapt accordingly.andP;  All 11 work just fine at 2,400 and 1,200 bps, and allbut 3 -- the nearly identical Computer Friends, Digicom, and Prometheusmodems -- can also communicate at 300 bps.andP;  (Computer Friends offers 300-bpscompatibility as a $109 option.)andP;  While you certainly wouldn't choose tocommunicate at 300 bps, there are still some connections, including smallcomputer bulleting boards, that require such slo-mo transmission.andM;Bits and BaudandM;Slowing down isn't a matter of the modem's simply reducing the number of bitsit sends over the phone line.andP;  Each transmission rate uses a completelydifferent type of modulation and demodulation (see Figure 3).andP;  A V.32 modemthat can transmit and receive information at 300, 1,200, 2,400, and 9,600 bpsis actually the equivalent of four modems in one.andM;Modem speed is rated in bits of information sent or received each second(bps).andP;  This rating is determined by multiplying two numbers: how many timesthe signal is modulated, or changed, each second (baud rate) and how manybits of information are transmitted with each change.andP;  Although most peopleuse baud rate and bps interchangeably, these two measurements are equal onlyfor the slowest, simplest modems.andM;Not surprisingly, the faster the modem, the more complex the modulation.andP;  A300-bps modem modulates the pitch, or frequency, of its signal at a leisurely300 times per second (300 baud).andP;  The frequency goes up or down to indicateeither a 1 or a 0; each change thus provides 1 bit of information to thereceiving modem.andM;A 1,200-bps modem takes a somewhat different approach.andP;  It modulates signalsat a rate of 600 baud and transmits 2 bits of information with each frequencychange, encoding each bit by changing the signal's phase -- its positionrelative to the previous signal change -- rather than by altering itsfrequency.andM;Modems achieve speeds greater than 1,200 bps by altering the signal'samplitude, or strength, in addition to its phase.andP;  This scheme, calledquadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), can transmit 4 bits per baud.andP;  At 600changes per second (600 baud), the result is 2,400 bps.andP;  All the superspeedmodems we tested use the phase-and-amplitude-modulation scheme, but theycrank up the baud rate from 600 to 2,400.andP;  The resulting 9,600 bps leaves2,400-bps modems in the dust.andM;However, at 9,600 bps, the limitations of the phone company's lines andequipment begin to complicate matters.andP;  A telephone line can handle onlyfrequencies between 300 and 3,000 hertz.andP;  This band-width, or useful signalarea, is further reduced when you subtract all the frequencies the phonecompany needs for communicating with its own equipment.andP;  At 2,400 baud andwith 4 bits of information per baud, the bandwidth is just not &quot;wide&quot; enoughto allow two 9,600-bps modems to communicate simultaneously withoutinterfering with each other.andP;  In fact, the transmission of the originatingmodem takes up most of the available bandwidth by itself -- no room is leftin the bandwidth for the answering modem to respond.andM;The most common industry standards for telecommunications -- including V.32-- reqire simultaneous, or full-duplex, communication.andP;  That is, both theoriginating and the answering modem must be able to &quot;talk&quot; and &quot;listen&quot; atthe same time.andP;  Lower-speed modems achieve full-duplex transmission bytalking and listening at different frequencies.andP;  As mentioned, the telephonebandwidth is too narrow for this strategy to work at 9,600 bps, so how dosuperspeed modems achieve full-duplex communications?andM;The solution, echo cancellation, is simple in concept but devilishlydifficult in practice.andP;  When two 9,600-bps modems talk to each other acrossthe same line at the same time, the interference between the two signalsscrambles both transmission beyond recognition.andP;  Each modem hears both thetones that it's sending and the tones being received from the other modem.andO;What's worse, these tones don't simply play together like a piano chord;instead, they combine into completely new tones with inappropriate meanings.andM;A V.32 modem makes sense of this cacophony by using echo cancellation.andP;  Thatis, it remembers the tones it has sent and subtracts them from the scrambledtransmission it hears.andP;  The modem then pases on to its host computer what'sleft -- the data sent by the other modem.andP;  This degree of modem &quot;smarts&quot;requires onboard DSPs (digital signal processors) capable of carrying out 25million instructions per second.andP;  This is one reason why superspeed modemscost so much more than their slower relatives.andM;Make No MistakeandM;The V.32 standard permits -- but does not require -- an error-reductionscheme called TCM (trellis-code modulation), which adds yet another bit ofinformation to each baud.andP;  The receiving modem checks this fifth bit againsta complex coding system to see if an error has occurred in transmission; ifit has, it attempts a correction.andP;  The Telebit T2500 is the only modem thatdoesn't use TCM at 9,600 bps.andM;Two other features, error detection and data compression, are found in mostmodems of this caliber even though they aren't part of V.32.andP;  Of the 11modems, 10 provide MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol) Class 4 error detectionand MNP Class 5 data compression.andP;  MNP classes are communications protocolslicensed to each modem manufacturer by Microcom (thus adding to the price ofa 9.600-bps modem).andP;  These protocols are so popular that they have becomeinformal industry standards.andM;The error detection scheme of MNP Class 4 is fundamentally different fromerror reduction as performed by trelliscode modulation.andP;  TCM is the firstline of defense against transmission errors: it can find and fix an erroranywhere in a packet of data.andP;  A modem using TCM attempts to make an educatedguess after it detects an error--and it's smart enough to be right a goodpercentage of the time.andM;If TCM doesn't find or fix the error.andP;  MNP Class 4 take over and asks theoriginating modem to retransmit the offending data packet.andP;  If the errorscome too frequently.andP;  MNP Class 4 instructs the originating modem to assemblethe data into smaller packets.andP;  The smaller packets take less time toretransmit when an error is found, and more make it through on the first try.andO;By using both TCM and MNP Class 4, at 9,600-bps modem can provide essentiallyerror-free performance even over noisy phone lines.andM;Cutting Down the NoiseandM;The erratic noise levels on phone lines are a major factor in modemperformance.andP;  Accordingly, we gave each modem a chance to prove itself onrecreations of three common line types -- a local call, a bounce off a singlesatellite, and a cross-country terrestrial link -- using testing equipmentdesigned by Processing Telecom Technologies (PTT) of Huntsville, Alabama.andM;We chose these three lines because they are probably the ones you use most indaily communications and because they present three clearly different -- andincreasing -- sets of problems.andP;  A local line is the cleanest, but even itpicks up an occasional pop when rerouted by a switching device in thedowntown phone office or a little hum when someone turns on a vacuum cleaner.andO;The satellite line suffers most from echo, caused by a bit of the transmittedsignal bouncing back to the modem that sent it.andP;  A cross-country line istoughest for most modems to negotiate, because it includes both the switchingnoise of a local call and the decrease in signal strength inevitable whencrossing long distances.andM;These phone-line gremlins are known as line impairments, and the moreimpairments that disrupt a line, the more errors that can occur.andP;  We usedEZBERT software from PTT to synthesize local, satellite, and cross-countryline impairments as defined by the Electronics Industry Associationspecification EIA 496-A (yes, there are even standards for noise in thetelecommunications industry).andP;  Our testing instruments included a 5000 ModemTest Set for noise-tolerance testing, a 5100 telephone-line simulator, and a5151 echo/advanced impairment simulator.andM;Because MNP Class 4 asks the originating modem to resend bad data, we turnedit off to get a more accurate assessment of how many errors each modem madewhen modulating a noisy analog signal back into digital data.andP;  Thismodulation takes place in a modem's heart and soul: its data pump.andP;  A sturdy,efficient data pump contributes to a modem's performance by completing themodulation as fast as possible and by making few errors in the process.andO;Because each error normally makes MNP Class 4 ask for a retransmission, higherror rates slow throughput considerably.andM;Our tests revealed that although the modems varied in performance, even alarge amount of noise had little adverse effect on most of them (see Figure1).andP;  For each modem, there was a levl of noise at which the data pump beganto make errors and a final point at which the error level was so great thatMNP Class 4 -- had it been turned on -- would have disconnected the modemfrom the noisy line.andP;  The NEC N9631 showed the best noise tolerance on allline types, while the Bytcom Strata V.32 lost the phone connection on thesatellite and cross-country lines with only moderate noise.andM;The most peculiar performer--so odd that we repeated the test several timesto make sure it was true -- was the Fast-Comm FDX 9696.andP;  It showedbetter-than-average noise tolerance when tested over local and cross-countrylines, but it began making errors much earlier than any other modem when wesimulated a satellite transmission.andP;  However, the FDX 9696 hung in there aswe worsened the line, and eventually it tied with the NEC N9631 andPrometheus ProModem 9600M Plus for highest satellite-noise tolerance.andP;  Inshort, it somehow managed to be both worst and best in the same test.andO;Apparently, the gremlin most associated with satellite lines -- echo -- couldmake the FDX 9696 stumble but had a hard time making it fall.andM;Fast, Faster, FastestandM;Data compression is what enables a superspeed modem to truly live up to itsname.andP;  To accomplish transmission rates well over the modem's basic rating of9,600 bps, MNP Class 5 data compression comes into play.andP;  This protocolshrinks a file into the smallest possible number of bits and then expands thefile back to its original size at the receiving end.andP;  Because some files canbe compressed to half their original size, this squeeze-transmit-unsqueezescheme lets two MNP-equipped modems -- one sending and one receiving --transmit data at throughput rates of up to 19,200 bps.andP;  But as our throughputtest results show, no modem reaches that ideal speed.andP;  Instead,less-than-optimal modem design and noisy phone lines reduce performance.andO;(Two new protocols, MNP Class 9 and V.42bis, have a theoretical maximum of38,400 bps.andP;  See the &quot;On the Horizon&quot; sidebar.)andM;For our throughput tests, we used the same three simulated phone lines asbefore.andP;  The type of data being sent greatly influences a modem's speed, sowe transmitted both binary and text files.andP;  Binary files such as Macapplications are difficult to compress because they're designed to be assmall as possible in the first place.andP;  Our binary test used a resource filethat had already been squeezed to 109K by StuffIt.andP;  On the other hand, ourtext fiel -- a 104K Word 4.0 file saved with the Text Only option -- hadplenty of fat for the compression algorithms to trim.andM;Although noen of the modems could send text at the theoretical maximum of19,200 bps, five units consistently surpassed 15,000 bps, and one -- the U.S.andO;Robotics Courier V.32 -- scratched the underside of 16,000 bps on every texttransfer (see Figure 2).andP;  When it came to binary files, however, only fourmodems were capable of speeds greater than 9,600 bps.andM;The Telebit T2500 was the champ at binary-file transfers and consistentlytransmitted both text and binary files at about the same rate (around 11,500bps).andP;  The Telebit modem uses a data-compression protocol known asLempel-Ziv, which is clearly superior at compressing binary files.andO;Unfortunately, the proprietary Lempel-Ziv scheme works only for filetransfers to another Telebit T2500 modem.andP;  By the time you read this, theTelebit T2500 should also offer MNP Class 5 data compression.andP;  MNP Class 5will handle compression below 9,600 bps, and Lempel-Ziv will take over atmore rapid rates.andM;Lonely at the TopandM;Except for price, the 9,600-bps modems we tested share more similarities thandifferences.andP;  Each follows the V.32 standard, and all but one includetrelliscode modulation for error reduction, MNP Class 4 for error detection,and MNP Class 5 for data compression.andP;  Even so, differences in performance doexist, so you should weigh the pros and cons of each modem carefully andmatch them to your needs.andM;Consider how you will use your new superspeed modem.andP;  Will you be sendingfiles down the street or bouncing them off a satellite?andP;  Do you plan todownload highly compressed text files, or will you be tossing bulkyapplications and graphics files back and forth?andP;  Do you care what's includedfor the price you pay, or do you already have all the cables and softwarethat you need?andP;  Find the modem with strengths that match your needs, andyou're certain to be happy with your choice.andM;And remember, as with any other maturing technology, 9,600-bps modems willinevitably get less expensive as they become more common.andP;  In a year or two,they may be as inexpensive as 2,400-bps modems are today -- and there will befar more modems for you to communicate with at super speeds.andP;  So is it reallyworth all that extra cash to be the first with the fastest?andP;  Sure it is....andM;Gordon McComb writes frequently about computers and high technology andrecently became a father for the second time.andP;  As a brand-new associateeditor at MacUser, Rik Myslewski is concerned that hundreds of thousands ofpeople will now mispronounce his name.andM;Late ArrivalsandM;At least five new low-cost V.32 moderns have appeared since we completed ourtests.andP;  Microcom (Norwood, Massachusetts), creator of the MNP protocols, hasintroduced the OX/3296c ($1.129).andP;  As you might guess, a 9,600-bps modem fromMicrocom not only conforms to the V.32 standard but also includes MNP Classes4 and 5.andM;General DataComm (Middlebury, Connecticut) has introduced a new line ofsuperspeed modems, including the fully V.32-compatible DeskTop V.32E($1,095).andP;  Ven-Tel (San Jose, California) has announced the 9600 PlusExternal Modem ($1,195 to $1,395, depending on options), Ven-Tel claims thatits data-compression protocols will enable two 9600 Plus modems tocommunicate with each other at speeds up to 38,400 bps.andP;  Anchor Automation(Chatsworth, California) has entered the V.32 market with the 96E4 ($995).andO;Anchor's 9,600-bps entry distinguishes itself with expanded auto-dialingcapabilities and a five-year warranty.andM;By the time you read this, Farallon Computing (Berkeley, California) shouldhave shipped its new Timbuktu/Remote Access Pack ($1,295), which includesTimbuktu/Remote software, a Remote/WakeUp cable, and a repackaged Multi-TechmultiModemV32.andP;  The package contains all you need to start up, access,operate, and retrieve files at 9,600 bps from a remote Mac.andM;Seeing Through the HayesandM;No modem report is complete without mention of at least one Hayes product.andO;Hayes is the market leader in modems for personal computers and the creatorof the Hayes Standard AT Command Set, which is used in nearly every modemmade today (see &quot;Modem Speak,&quot; November '89).andP;  When we began our testing,Hayes offered two 9,600-bps modems, but neither fit the criteria weestablished for this report.andP;  Its inexpensive 9,600-bps model didn't meet theV.32 standard, and the V.32-compliant modem cost more than the $1,500 limitwe set for &quot;affordable&quot; modems.andP;  Long after our tests were completed, Hayesannounced a true V.32 modem for $1.199, the V-series ULTRA Smartmodem 9600.andO;Although we were unable to test this new offering, we did test the older,non-V.32 V-senes Smartmodem 9600, but we didn't include its results withthose of the true V.32 modems.andM;Hayes admits that the older V-series Smartmodem 9600 is not a full-duplexV.32 modem and that it uses a ping-pong protocol (which Hayes calls V.32HDX)to &quot;simulate full-duplex V.32 operation.&quot;andP;  Ping-pong is a half-duplexprotocol; that is, the originating and answering modems take turnstransmitting instead of sending and receiving simultaneously (full-duplex) asrequired by the V.32 standard.andP;  Ping-pong's chief benefit -- to Hayes, not tomodem users -- is that it eliminates the need for expensiveecho-cancellation, circuitry.andM;The ping-pong mathod works fine for file transfers on clean lines because afile is sent in only one direction.andP;  However, error detection and dataretransmission are far faster in full-duplex communications.andP;  In our tests,the V-series Smartmodem 9600 held its own against the slowest V.32 modems onlocal and cross-country lines.andP;  But when it tried to deal with the echoes inour simulated satellite line, its text-file throughput sank to half theaverage speed of the others.andM;The V-Series Smartmodem 9600 follows some of the specifications of the V.32standards, such as quadrature amplitude modulation and the ability to matchspeeds with slower modems, but this isn't enough to make it compatible withthe other modems we tested.andP;  If you require compatibility, consider the newV.32-compatible Hayes V-series ULTRA Smartmodem 9600 or one of the V.32modems we tested.andP;  Contact Hayes Microcomputer Products at 705 Westech Drive,Norcross, GA 30092; (404) 441-1617.andM;The Bottom LineandM;One man's &quot;affordable&quot; modem is another man's luxury.andP;  Before you shell out$800 to $1,500 for a superspeed modem, be sure that an inexpensive 2,400-bpsmodel won't meet your needs, and remember that you can talk at super speedonly to other 9,600-bps modems.andP;  But if you want lightning-fast file transferor remote-control communications, by all means pay the premium.andP;  Nothingbeats a 9,600-bps modem for saving that most precious commodity -- time.andM;Three modems scored high enough to be considered &quot;best buys,&quot; but we gave thenod to the CONNECT V.32 Service ($999).andP;  It has blazing speed, a goodbit-error rate on the three line types we tested, and a generous two-yearwarranty.andP;  Its price includes a $149 subscription -- with software -- toCONNECT, the only major online service that offers 9,600-bps access (and thefirst hour is free).andP;  In addition, the V.32 Service doesn't require you tomodify the modem cable to support the hardware handshaking needed forsuperspeed communications; it can make the necessary changes internally.andM;Close behind -- very close -- is the Racal-Vadic 9632VP ($995).andP;  There's areason for this neck-and-neck performance: They're the same modem.andP;  AllCONNECT adds is a tiny label stuck over Racal-Vadic's name.andP;  However,Racal-Vadic doesn't include all the goodies that CONNECT adds to the V.32Service package and the 9632VP warranty is just one year.andM;Our second runner-up, the U.S.andP;  Robolics Courier V.32 ($1,495), is the speeddemon of 9,600-bps V.32 modems and might have been our top choice if pricehad been no object.andP;  However, you must decide if a marginal increase in speedis worth a substantial increase in price.andM;Honorable mention goes to two slower but feature-laden modems.andP;  PrometheusProducts ProModem 9600M Plus ($995) and Computer Friends LightSpeed ($799).andO;These are clones of the Digicom V.32 9624LE, but they include powerful andeasy-to-use telecommunications applications.andP;  As with the V.32 Service, bothare ready to use straight out of the box, and their cables are fine just asthey are.andP;  If you want a complete V.32 modem package, either the ProModem9600M Plus or the LightSpeed will let you jump on the superspeed bandwagonthe quickest and the easiest -- even though your wagon will move a lot fasterif you hitch it to one of our three top choices.andM;On the HorizonandM;In the next five to ten years, our current telephone network will be replacedby an entirely new digital data-transmission medium called ISDN (IntegratedServices Digital Network).andP;  Until the ISDN network reaches into every homeand office in the country, however, new products and services will continueto serve the current analog telephone network.andM;For example, Rockwell engineers are putting the finishing touches on a singlechip that will include all the basic functions of both a V.32 and V.29 (fax)modem.andP;  Modems using this chip should appear in mid-1990.andP;  Microcom's mostrecent offering, MNP Class 9, can achieve a 4:1 data-compression ratio with atheoretical maximum throughput of 38,400 bps.andP;  Two new internationalstandards, V.42 and V.42bis (bis is the French abbreviation for second), alsoprovide 38,400-bps performance.andP;  Despite their names, V.42 is not areplacement for V.32, and V.42bis is not an enhancement of V.42.andP;  Instead,V.42 is an error-detection scheme, and V.42bis is a data-compression routinethat uses the Lempel-Ziv protocol.andP;  Future V.32 modems will comply with thesestandards; the one you buy today should be easy to upgrade.andM;Amodem cranking out 38.4 Kbps (kilobits, or thousands of bits, per second) ispushing the theoretical limit for transmission through standard phone lines.andO;But you can go much faster -- if you're willing to pay the price.andP;  Mosttelephone companies can provide data-communications channels that range from56 Kbps to 45 Mbps (megabits, or millions of bits, per second).andP;  Privatefiber-optic transmission circuits are available that reach speeds as high as600 Mbps.andP;  But even the relatively straightforward 1.54-Mbps communicationsservice known as T1 requires interface equipment costing at least $5,000 ateach end, and your monthly payments to the phon company can easily reachthousands of dollars.andM;If you can, hang on until ISDN becomes available.andP;  An ISDN-connection devicecalled a BRI (basic rate interface) will provide you with two separatechannels of 64-Kbps communications for a monthly charge of less than $50.andO;Unlike some other superspeed solutions, BRI will keep you connected with therest of the low-speed world.andP;  Your telephone company will also offer ahigher-priced service called ISDN primary rate, which will have 24communications channels totaling 1.54 Mbps -- sufficient for voice, data, andcompressed-video teleconferencing.andM;If you're willing to convert to costly fiber-optic connections, broadbandISDN will let you reach 2.4 Gbps (gigabits, or billions of bits, per second).andO;This speed's phenomenally wide bandwidth will be capable of simultaneouslycarrying the equivalent of more than 20,000 TV channels.andP;  But don't rush tosign up -- broadband ISDN won't become widely available until the nextmillenium.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
