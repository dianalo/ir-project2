Although this method too, in addition to the known balloon      dilatation, permits treatment without surgical intervention and from the      start was very promising, the opening of stenosed vessels using laser      light has nevertheless scarcely progressed beyond the experimental stage.      An important reason for this is that no suitable catheter was available      which permitted an accurate positioning of the light guides in the vessel.      Nor has a solution hitherto been found to the risk of dissection of the      vessel wall. </PAR><PAR>  An angioplasty light guide catheter is known in which the laser light is      bundled with lenses. An angioplasty light guide catheter is also known      from an article in the periodical Herzandplus;Gefass 5 (1985) page 185, FIG. 5,      in which three concentrically arranged laser light guides can be held in      the vessel stable against the wall by means of a balloon. In this catheter      too, an accurate positioning and control of the laser light is not      possible, and the risk of dissection is relatively high. In this case      there is also the disadvantage that, with a catheter with a wall-stable      laser light guide, severe occlusions cannot be treated successfully. In      the case of such severe occlusions, a catheter with a centrally arranged      light guide, as is known from the periodical JACC Volume 8  (5), November      1986; 1989-95 (FIG. 1), would be better suited. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The object of the invention is to provide a catheter of the said generic      type, with which the laser light can be controlled safely and simply, and      which is suitable for the treatment of stenoses of varying degrees,      without any risk of dissection of the vessel wall. </PAR><PAR>  In the catheter according to the invention, the distance of the exit points      of the light guides from the centre line of the balloon is a function of      the pressure of the balloon fluid. This pressure can be altered and      controlled accurately and in a simple manner by the surgeon. In the case      of a low pressure and a correspondingly small diameter of the dilatation      balloon, the laser light is concentrated in the vessel centre and is      therefore particularly suitable for the treatment of severe stenoses. In      the case of a higher pressure, the exit points lie correspondingly closer      to the inside wall of the vessel, and the outer-lying areas of stenoses      can also be removed correspondingly. Further advantageous features will      emerge from the dependent claims and from the description. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  An exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in greater detail      below with reference to the drawings, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows diagrammatically a stenosed vessel section with the dilatation      balloon inserted, </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows a cross-section through a dilatation balloon, </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows a longitudinal section through the distal end of a dilated      balloon in a diagrammatically represented stenosed vessel section, </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows a longitudinal section through the rear area of a dilatation      balloon, and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 shows a cross-section through the shaft of a catheter according to      the invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows, purely diagrammatically, a blood vessel 8 with a stenosis 7,      and a catheter with a dilatation balloon 1 and a catheter shaft 2 inserted      percutaneously into the vessel. The catheter is inserted into the vessel 8      using a guide wire 4. The guide wire 4 extends through the shaft 2 and the      dilatation balloon 1 and can emerge at a distal opening 18. As FIG. 5      shows, the shaft 2 is divided by a wall 10 into a lumen 11 for the guide      wire 4 and a lumen 12 for pressure fluid. The lumen 12 is connected,      according to FIG. 4, via an opening 9 to the balloon interior 13, and      connected at the proximal end to a suction and pressure pump 16. By means      of the pump 16, the pressure in the interior 13 of the dilatation balloon      1 can be regulated accurately and, consequently, the diameter of the      balloon can be regulated. When the catheter is introduced, the dilatation      balloon 1 is folded in a known manner. In the unfolded state, the      dilatation balloon 1, as can be seen from FIG. 1, is externally      cylindrical between the two tapering ends. </PAR><PAR>  According to FIG. 2, the wall 5 of the dilatation balloon 1 consists of an      inner layer 5a and an outer layer 5b. The inner layer 5a consists of a      relatively soft plastic and the outer layer 5b preferably of silicone      rubber. In contrast to the known dilatation balloons, the wall 5 of the      dilatation balloon 1 is elastically extensible within certain limits.      Light guide fibres or bundles 6 are stuck onto the inner layer 5a and are      covered by the outer layer 5b to thereby be embedded in the outer layer.      These light guides 6 are distributed uniformly over the periphery of the      wall 5 and run parallel to the longitudinal direction of the catheter 6.      When the balloon 1 is dilated, the exit points 6a of the light guides 6      lie in a circle and in a plane which intersects the dilatation balloon      approximately at the transition between its cylindrical area 1a and its      distal tapered area 1b. The light guides 6 also extend over the entire      length of the shaft 2 and are coupled via a connection piece 14 to a laser      device 15. The device 15 is preferably a pulsating xenon-chloride excimer      laser. The light generated by the laser device 15 passes via the      connection piece 14 and the shaft 2 to the exit points 6a of the light      guides 6. </PAR><PAR>  The light guides 6 have a diameter of for example 0.1 mm and are very      flexible. The dilatation balloon 1 can thus be folded even with the light      guides 6 inserted. The radial distance of the light guides 6 from the      centre line of the dilatation balloon 1 increases as the pressure of the      fluid present in the balloon increases. Accordingly, the distance of the      exit points 6a from the centre line of the dilatation balloon 1 is a      function of the pressure which can be regulated by the pump 16. Since the      wall 5 is elastically extensible, it is possible, by means of the pressure      regulation, to arrange the exit points 6a in circles of differing radii.      Accordingly, the laser beams emerging at the exit points 6a strike the      stenosis 7 at a greater or lesser distance from the inner side of the      vessel. When the pressure in the dilatation balloon is relatively low, a      correspondingly intense laser light bundle is thus directed towards the      centre of the stenosis. In contrast, in the case of a higher pressure, the      more outer areas of the stenosis 7 are removed with less dense laser      light. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 3, the dilatation balloon 1 is positioned in front of the      stenosis 7 for the removal of the stenosis 7 using laser light. The      position of the dilatation catheter 1 can be observed using a marker strip      17. In addition to the removal of the stenosis using laser light energy,      the use of conventional balloon dilatation is also conceivable with the      catheter according to the invention. Thus, without changing the catheter,      a stenosis 7 can be expanded with the dilatation balloon 1 before or after      treatment using laser light energy. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
