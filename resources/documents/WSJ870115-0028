According to the maker of semiconductor manufacturing and testing equipment, Peat, Marwick Mitchell andamp; Co.'s opinion said Reid-Ashman's continuation as a going concern depends on &quot;achieving and maintaining profitable results and operations and maintaining adequate sources of financing.&quot;    In addition, Reid-Ashman reported a $6.5 million net loss for the fiscal year, despite a 78% rise in revenue to $13.2 million. The results included a $5 million write-off of intangible assets and an income tax credit of $790,000. The company cited the semiconductor industry's steep downturn. In the previous year, the company had net income of $254,000, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $7.5 million.    Joseph McDowell, chairman and chief executive officer, said that while results haven't yet been finalized, the company may have returned to profitability in the first quarter ended Dec. 31, on revenue of about $4.5 million. First-quarter results will be released in mid-February. Mr. McDowell also said he anticipates revenue in the current quarter will fall from the first quarter's.    The company also said it will dismiss about 10%, or fewer than 20, of its employees. Mr. McDowell recently agreed, subject to certain reviews, to purchase 333,333 shares of newly issued Reid-Ashman common for $1.50 each, the company said. It also said its primary lender recently increased its credit line to $1.5 million from $850,000.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, the company's stock closed at $1.375, up 6.25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
