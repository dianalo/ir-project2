Despite the frivolity, however, the one-day &quot;warning&quot;strike underscores a serious concern that the party may bewinding down in Luxembourg's financial center. After roaringthrough the 1980s, when new foreign banks arrived in wavesand the banking industry's assets more than tripled, bankerssee fewer opportunities for growth in the 1990s. Althoughprofits generally remain healthy, some banks are trimmingtheir staffs; others are scaling back expansion plans.</LP><TEXT>   The strike, the first in memory at banks here, illustratesthat bank executives are more worried about costs, and unionsare anxious about job security.   Banks generally say that they will be open today, but thatsome services may be curtailed.   Since last October, banks and unions have been haggling inan attempt to renew an industrywide pay agreement coveringabout 12,000 employees. As usual, the two sides are dividedover pay and vacation time. The biggest sticking point,however, is the banks' demand that the industry's senioritysystem be overhauled. That system, modeled on the Luxembourgcivil service, classifies employees by education level andguarantees them regular advances up the pay scale, regardlessof performance.   The banks say existing employees can keep those rights,but newcomers should be subject to a more flexible systemthat links pay more closely to performance andresponsibility.   &quot;We must stop being bureaucracies where people start at 18(years of age) and by just doing their job, they know that in25 years they will be at that (pay) level and in 40 years atthat level, more than doubling,&quot; says Jean Adant, chiefexecutive at Kredietbank SA Luxembourgeoise.   Unionists protest that the new system would expose them toarbitrary treatment and undo decades of advances in workers'rights. They also say that if managers want to contain costs,they should look to their own rapidly rising salaries. &quot;Amongthe management,&quot; says Eugene Storck, chairman of the largestbanking union here, &quot;too many people are preaching waterwhile drinking champagne.&quot;   Today's strike is a test of whether employees are willingto go beyond such quips. Some bankers predict that only 15%to 25% of employees will join the strike. Mr. Storck declinesto give a forecast. He notes that it is much easier forunions to organize in the handful of big, locally orientedbanks than in smaller offices of the 180 or so foreign banksrepresented here.   The banks apparently feel emboldened to make a standagainst the unions partly because labor is growing lessscarce. In the 1980s, new banks regularly poached staff fromolder ones, bidding up pay at what some bankers considered adangerous pace. Now, some banks are managing to reduce theirstaffs modestly through automation. At the same time, fewernew banks are arriving. Although there is no sign of a largeexodus, BankAmerica Corp. recently pulled out of Luxembourg.Some other banks, after flocking in to set up investmentfunds and provide other services to wealthy people, arefinding the marketplace cramped.   &quot;We must be aware that life is becoming tougher, that weare much more exposed to competition from the outside,&quot; saysJean Krier, chairman of the local bankers' association andchief executive of Banque Internationale a Luxembourg SA.   Some of the scare-talk may be mere posturing. Totalprofits in the country's banking sector, after fallingmodestly last year, are back on a rising trend so far thisyear, according to the Institut Monetaire Luxembourgeois,which regulates banks. Union leaders thus accuse the banks ofcrying wolf to frighten workers into concessions.   Yet banks do have genuine reasons to worry about long-termprospects.   Luxembourg became a magnet for banks over the past twodecades because it kept its regulation light, charged nowithholding tax on interest income and barred tax collectorsfrom snooping through bank records. Now, however, theEuropean Community is gradually harmonizing financialregulation, eroding some of Luxembourg's advantages overother member states. In addition, other countries are tryingharder to keep banking and investment business at home.   Belgium, for example, last year lowered its withholdingtax on interest income to 10%, from 25%. That means Belgianshave less incentive to bother stashing their savings inLuxembourg. Jean Guill, a director of the Institut Montaire,says there is no sign so far that Belgians are pulling theirmoney out. But some bankers fear that there will be asignificant loss of Belgian business in the long term.   Banking secrecy also is in question. Other EC nationsperiodically pressure Luxembourg to provide more help inexposing tax fraud. Later this year, the Luxembourgparliament is due to discuss legislation that would definemore clearly in what cases such cooperation could be granted.   &quot;We believe Luxembourg will give up something&quot; from itstradition of bank secrecy to appease fellow EC members, saysMr. Adant of Kredietbank. He argues that few bank customersare involved in tax evasion serious enough to be considered acriminal offense. Still, he says, any compromise on banksecrecy will affect Luxembourg's image as a haven ofconfidentiality. &quot;And sometimes the image is more importantthan the reality,&quot; he adds.</TEXT></DOC>
