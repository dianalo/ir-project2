Leonel Gonzalez, one of five commanders of the leftist FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front, said Tuesday that the rebelsapprove of the plans by the Democratic Revolutionary Front to takepart in the elections.   ``That they have decided to participate is an autonomousdecision that in no way damages the (military-political) alliancebut rather strengthens it in light of the current situation,'' hesaid on the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos.   The Democratic Revolutionary Front, an umbrella organization ofleftist political organizations linked to the guerrilla army,announced last month that they would take part in the elections.   The rebels and the leftists have boycotted elections here forthe past decade, contending the balloting was part of aU.S.-designed counterinsurgency effort and that democracy did notexist in El Salvador.   The rebels have been battling the U.S.-backed government since1979. An estimated 65,000 people have died during the civil war.   The election likely will be a close contest between ElSalvador's two dominant parties, the incumbent Christian Democratsand the conservative Republican Nationalist Alliance.   The rightist alliance, known as Arena, gained control of thelegislature and two-thirds of the country's municipal governmentsin elections held in March.   Incumbent President Jose Napoleon Duarte, barred by theconstitution from another term as president, has been diagnosed ashaving terminal liver cancer. Gonzalez said on Radio Venceremosthat the left's participation is intended ``to prepare all forcesfor the politically negotiated solution (to the war). It is acorrect decision.''   But he said ``We must make the entire electoral process apolitical and military battleground.   ``Our military action will deepen the political crisis andcomplicate the electoral scheme,'' he said.   The guerrillas demand a share of power in what they say would bea transition government ``of broad popular participation.'' Thegovernment has repeatedly rejected the demand, insisting the rebelslay down their arms and compete for power through elections.</TEXT></DOC>
