The company also said it would perform a yearlong evaluation of 10 paper mills in the Northeast and South to determine if a paper-bleaching process needs to be improved.    In January and February, according to a company spokesman, three incidents at the company's mill in Jay, Maine, prompted the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to inspect the site. The incidents involved alleged safety and health violations in a bleach kraft manufacturing process, in which brown wood pulp is bleached with chlorine to produce white paper.    The subsequent inspections, covering a period of several months, identified numerous alleged safety and health violations in the mill's bleach kraft process. International Paper said it agreed not to contest OSHA's fine, but added that it hasn't admitted any guilt nor has it acknowledged that any violations actually occurred.    David W. Oskin, a senior vice president at International Paper, said: &quot;We are confident that our bleaching activities are consistent with the highest standards for safety in the industry. At the same time, we recognize that improvements are always possible.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
