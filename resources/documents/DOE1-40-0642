Thus it is now possible todiagnose all the inherited conditions of hemoglobin by DNA analysis.As more genes are cloned, other genetic diseases are becoming amenableto this method of detection. Random DNA probes may soon be used to diagnosediseases in which the defective structural gene has not been identified.In addition, the isolation of Y-chromosome-specific probes has provideda rapid method of fetal sex determination, and early diagnosis of geneticdisorders in the first trimester is being explored using chorionic villibiopsy.</TEXT></DOC>
