It's the phantomlandlord of several office towers, shopping centers, polo grounds, asewage plant and a 78-acre thoroughbred horse farm.   What does the Federal Deposit Insurance Co. know about changingbedsheets, flipping hotcakes, treating sludge or saddling horses?Nothing.   The FDIC inherited these properties after rescuing a spate ofinsolvent banks over the years, and it's now auctioning them off enmasse to investors worldwide.   Banking experts say the agency could be involved in many more ofthese auctions in the not-so-distant future if President Bush's planfor solving the nation's savings and loan crisis proceeds as planned.   Bush proposes to restructure the thrift regulatory system bygiving the FDIC the added responsibility of insuring Sandamp;Ls, currentlythe job of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. The changewould pass on to the FDIC the authority of handling repossessedthrift assets, including real estate.   The Federal Asset Disposition Association, a subsidiary of FSLIC,says it alone manages 2,400 FSLIC property assets in 33 states withan appraised value of $3.8 billion _ most the result of bad loansmade by hundreds of failed thrifts over the years, half of whichwere in the Southwest. Among the properties: a 497-acre safari parkin Branson, Mo.   For now, though, the FDIC has its own white-elephant propertiesto contend with.   About $84 million worth, or 20 percent of the FDIC's current realestate portfolio, will be sold this Thursday in a venture with theauctioneer Christie's and the real estate firm Cushman andamp; Wakefield.   The event marks the first large-scale real estate auction for theFDIC and only the second real estate auction for Christie's, whichis better known for pitching multimillion dollar art collections andrare jewels, not empty motels.   Arthur F. Lorentzen Jr., assistant director of the FDIC'sDivision of Liquidations, said the agency previously had disposed ofreal estate holdings through smaller regional auctions or sealedbids sales. He said the Christie's auction exposes the selectproperties to a wider range of potential investors.   On the block are 25 of the FDIC's largest properties, located inAlaska, Florida, New Mexico, California, Tennessee and Texas, wherebank failures have been increasing.   The auction targets range in value from a Houston apartmentcomplex worth around $650,000 to a 23-story office tower inKnoxville, Tenn., worth around $24 million.   A few had been owned directly by the problem banks while otherswere turned over to them as a result of loan defaults, Lorentzensaid.   When banks fail, the FDIC steps in to protect the deposits, thentries to sell some or all of the assets to a healthy institution.Sometimes it ends up with properties it doesn't want.   A record 217 banks failed in 1988, up from 184 the previous year,with many of them victims of depressed economies in the agriculturaland sunbelt regions. Some of the properties inherited by the FDICremain shut down, such as the 172-room Skyway Motel in St.Petersburg, Fla., which the FDIC received after local Park Bankfailed on Feb. 14, 1986.   Others remain open for business, like the 192-room HowardJohnson's motel and restaurant in Knoxville, Tenn., once theresponsibility of City and County Bank, which failed May 27, 1983.      ``We don't run them ourselves,'' Lorentzen said. ``We hire peopleto do that.   ``Anything we have it's our goal to put it back in the privatesector. Our main function is to insure deposits.''   The upcoming auction list includes about a dozen land parcels,three motels, two shopping centers, 10 apartment complexes and fiveoffice buildings. Earl Reiss, executive vice president for Cushmanand Wakefield, said that domestic response has been good so far butinterest from foreign investors hasn't been as strong.   Among the more unusual items:   _Tandamp;J Stables, based in Stevinson, Calif., a 78-acre thoroughbredhorse boarding, breeding and training facility. Horses not included.Valued at between $575,000 and $775,000.   _The Retama Polo Center and adjacent tract, located on 596 acresin Selma, Texas. The parcel includes 16 polo fields, a 3,776-seatgrandstand, horse stables, a veterinarian's clinic and apartments.Valued at between $7.5 million and $10.5 million.   _The 23-story Riverview Tower, one of the biggest buildings inKnoxville, Tenn. Valued at between $20 million and $24 million.   _Sarasota International Trade Center, a water and waste-watertreatment plant in Sarasota, Fla., valued at between $900,000 and$1.3 million.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 5</NOTE></DOC>
