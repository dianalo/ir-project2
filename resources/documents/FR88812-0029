These seasons generally will commenceon or about October 1, 1988, and include most of those for waterfowl.The Service annually prescribes migratory bird hunting regulations frameworksto the States. The effect of this proposed rule is to facilitate the selectionof hunting seasons by the States and to further the establishment of thelate-season migratory bird hunting regulations for 1988-89. These proposedframeworks differ substantially from last year.

The March 9 documentdealt with the establishment of hunting seasons, hours, areas and limitsfor migratory game birds under andSection;andSection; 20.101 through 20.107,20.109 and 20.110 of Subpart K. On June 7, 1988, the Service publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 20874) a second document consisting ofa supplemental proposed rulemaking dealing with both the early- and late-seasonframeworks. On July 11, 1988, the Service published for public commentin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 26198) a third document consisting ofa proposed rulemaking dealing specifically with frameworks for early-seasonmigratory bird hunting regulations. That document also reopened and extendedthe comment period for the proposed frameworks for Alaska, Puerto Ricoand Virgin Islands from June 22, 1988, to July 20, 1988. All three documents,March 9, June 7, and July 11, indicated that special consideration wasbeing given to possible restrictive regulations for all aspects of the1988-89 hunting season dependent upon the continuing poor status of ducks.On August 9, 1988, the Service published a fourth document (53 FR 29897)containing final frameworks for early migratory bird hunting seasons fromwhich wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, Puerto Ricoand the Virgin Islands selected early-season hunting dates, hours, areasand limits for 1988-89. This document is the fifth in the series and dealsspecifically with proposed frameworks for the 1988-89 late-season migratorybird hunting regulations. Before September 1, 1988, the Service intendsto publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a sixth document consisting of a final rule amendingSubpart K of 50 CFR 20 to set hunting seasons, hours, areas and limitsfor mourning doves, white-winged and white-tipped doves, bank-tailed pigeons,rails, woodcock, snipe, common moorhens and purple gallinules; sea duckseasons in certain defined areas of the Atlantic Flyway; experimental Septemberduck seasons in three States; experimental September Canada goose seasonsin three States; sandhill cranes; a special Canada goose season in southwesternWyoming; migratory game birds in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the VirginIslands; and extended falconry seasons.<ITAG tagnum="74">Statement by Frank Dunkle, Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for this Nation'smigratory waterfowl resources. Each year, the agency adopts regulationsgoverning the hunting of migratory waterfowl. It sets restrictions on thenumber of days hunters can hunt, a framework of dates for when the seasoncan open or close, and bag limits on the number and kind of ducks or geesethat can be taken. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This has been a terrible year for ducks. The continuing drought inmany prime waterfowl breeding areas of Canada and the northcentral UnitedStates severely limited their ability to nest. Since last year, more than1 million small wetlands have dried up. Service biologists are projectinga fall flight index of 66 million ducks_the second lowest on record. Thisis down from 1987's fall flight of 74 million birds. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">During the period 1985-87, restrictions on hunting reduced duck harvestby 25 percent. This year's down-turn in duck numbers indicates the needfor further restrictions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In light of the current situation, I am recommending the followingrestrictions to further reduce harvest during the 1988 waterfowl huntingseason:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Reducing hunting days in all flyways by 25 percent;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Shortening duck season opening and closing dates to October8-January 8 in all flyways;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Reducing bag limits by one duck in all flyways;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Suspending special scaup seasons and bonus scaup and teallimits;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Suspending the point system in determining bag limits forthis year in all flyways.

Sunrise will be the official starting time for shooting in 1988-89,and will be followed by a review of this issue prior to setting regulationsfor the 1989-90 hunting season. This will further reduce harvest and assisthunters in accurately distinguishing different species of ducks in flight.To achieve the necessary harvest reductions without this suspension wouldrequire more severe restrictions in other areas, for example, a furtherreduced bag, a further reduction in hunting days, and/or other more restrictivemeasures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I am confident these restrictions will result in at least a 25 percentreduction in duck harvest from the average achieved during the 1985-87period. I believe a reduction of this magnitude is necessary to protectduck broodstocks during this drought.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, the Service will monitor waterfowl migration and winteringareas this season. If the drought results in unusual concentrations ofbirds, making them vulnerable to hunters, I will not hesitate to utilizemy authority to close the season in some areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Our current waterfowl situation underscores the importance of theNorth American Waterfowl Management Plan. This international agreement,signed by representatives of the United States and Canada, is aimed atpreservation and enhancement of sufficient wetlands and other habitatson this continent to support fall flights of 100 million ducks. A parallelagreement with Mexico is expanding this important work into that country.Hunting is not the cause of the current decline in duck numbers. It is,however, one influence that must be regulated when populations are low.The long-term health of waterfowl depends on our ability to protect andenhance the wetland habitat which sustain these creatures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Numerous waterfowlers have told me they plan to cut back voluntarilyon the number of ducks they take this season, or even not hunt at all.I support these grass-roots conservation efforts, but urge those who choosenot to hunt to at least purchase a Duck Stamp and help provide dollarsthat are vital to out habitat acquisition efforts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While these changes in the waterfowl regulations may seem drastic,bold action is called for. I am confident this Nation's waterfowlers willunderstand the necessity of taking these steps and will make the sacrificesnecessary to insure the future integrity of waterfowl populations, wetlandhabitats, and the sport of waterfowling.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank Dunkle,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Review of 1980-88 Duck Situation</ITAG>The decade of the 1980's has not been good for ducks and their habitatacross large areas of North America. Continued widespread drought, andagricultural impacts on wetlands in Canada and the north-central UnitedStates led to record-low duck breeding populations and the lowest fallflight on record in 1985. Restrictive hunting regulations during 1985-87,in combination with low numbers of ducks, reduced harvest by 25 percent,with nearly equal reductions in each of the four flyways. Harvest rateson mallards were reduced significantly for all sex and age classes. Sincethen the drought has intensified and habitat destruction has continued,which has slowed recovery of duck breeding populations. The disastrousdrought of 1988 has reduced populations again almost to the levels of 1985.The problem is not one of a single year of severe drought in 1988, butthe result of several years of repeated poor conditions. Some importantbreeding areas in Prairie Canada have been extremely dry since 1980, whileothers have experienced wet and dry cycles, but nearly all are dry in 1988.The period of the 1980's has seen three of the five lowest May pond countson record in Prairie Canada. This year, severe drought also may adverselyaffect migration and wintering areas. Low stream flows, grain-crop failures,less natural food, and water shortages likely will tend to concentratewaterfowl, especially at critical migration stopovers and wintering sites.Such concentrations can lead to disease problems and greater vulnerabilityto hunting in addition to sending birds back to the breeding grounds inpoor condition next spring.Agricultural impact on marshes and surrounding habitats in Prairie Canadahas accelerated because of the drought and has seriously reduced the capabilityof traditional Canadian prairie habitats to produce ducks. Several yearsof good climatic conditions will be required before many drought-strickenareas can recover, revegetate, and produce ducks again. However, becauseof the widespread destruction of natural wetlands and the conversion ofpotential nesting areas of agriculture, many areas once important to breedingducks have been permanently affected. This factor will influence decisionsabout waterfowl harvest management for more than a single year. Breedingpopulations and production are showing the effects of both short and long-termstress on primary habitats.May surveys indicates that ducks were displaced from their traditionalprairie habitats more during 1988 than in any year of record. Extremelyhigh numbers of mallards, pintails, and blue-winged teal were displacedto the far north into habitats which are inherently less productive. Ducksdisplaced to the north historically do not reproduce well, and those thatremained in the prairies in spite of the drought encountered little wateror cover for their broods if they attempted to nest. Mallards, blue-wingedteal, and pintails have exhibited poor production in the past under conditionsnot as severe as those in 1988.The mallards breeding population in surveyed areas was 10 million birdsin 1970, 8 million in 1980, and 6.5 million in 1988. Pintail breeding stocksfollowed a similar pattern, going from 7 million to 5 million to 2.5 millionover the same time intervals. For mallards, this year's breeding populationwas the second lowest on record. The breeding population of pintails in1988 is the lowest on record. The fall flight index for ducks in 1988 is66 million, second only to the 62 million record low in 1985.After multiple years of very poor conditions, and in consideration of theseverity of the drought in 1988, maintenance of basic breeding populationsis now our primary objective, especially since we know these populationshave not produced well this year. Further, we are convinced that the impactswill persist for some time even if weather patterns change. Continued highharvest rates on populations with poor recruitment are not in the bestinterest of the resource, or the future of waterfowl hunting. For thesereasons, the Service is proposing hunting season frameworks significantlydifferent from those in previous years. We are proposing, at a minimum,an additional reduction in havest of the same magnitude as that reachedby changes implemented in 1985 and maintained through 1987. The substantialreductions proposed for duck season lengths, framework dates, and bag limits,as well as delayed shooting hours, are strong measures designed to reducehunting opportunity in order to reduce harvest. In addition, suspensionof some special seasons and reevaluation of harvest systems will providea better basis for future decisions about employment of the point system,zoning and split seasons, and other regulations. Many of the premises behindspecial seasons and other mechanisms in place before this year were developedto allow increased harvest opportunity at a time when populations werejudged capable of providing it. The Service feels that many of these regulationsare not consistent with the current status of the duck resource and shouldbe reviewed.Because these cited problems are not a single-year phenomenon, but ratherindicate some strong trends over many years, we are concerned about nextyear as well. Habitat conditions may not recover next year and, in fact,some duck populations may deteriorate further. On a long-term basis, weare certain that recovery will take at least several years of good climaticconditions, and probably will require direct habitat management to givepopulations the best chance of recovery in the future. If current habitatand population trends continue, further restrictions may be necessary inthe future, perhaps as early as 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review of Comments Received at Public Hearing</ITAG>Twenty-four statements were offered at the August 3, 1988, public hearing.Portions of some of these statements were related to matters outside thepurpose of the hearing. Each statement is summarized by category belowand was considered in the development of these proposed late-seasons frameworks.The comments below pertain to the proposals presented at the public hearing.However, the proposals contained herein encompass several regulatory changesnot reviewed at the public hearing, namely opening shooting hours, suspensionof the point system, modification of bag limits on mallards in the PacificFlyway, and a limited season on pintails. Therefore, responses to the publichearing comments are deferred and will be incorporated into responses tocomments received in reply to this document and published with the finalframeworks for late seasons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulations Process</ITAG>Mr. Brian O'Neill, a trial lawyer retained by the Humane Society of theUnited States, announced that he intends to explore the Service's processfor establishing hunting regulations to insure compliance with NationalEnvironmental Policy Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and other applicablelaws and regulations. Questions will be posed such as: does the huntingseason structure provide adequate protection to species such as black ducks,pintails, canvasbacks, and others, and does the decision process take ahard look at a ``no season'' alternative to protect ducks? He stated thatthe Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS-88) on migratorybird hunting, completed in 1988, does not do this, and this alternativemust be considered. He further stated that annual consideration of a ``noseason'' alternative may relieve some hunting pressure and tells the huntingpublic that business is not ``as usual.''1. Shooting HoursMr. John Anderson, representing the National Audubon Society, suggestedthat starting the duck season at noon on opening day and thereafter beginshooting at sunrise, rather than one-half hour before sunrise, would reducethe harvest of ducks.2. Frameworks for Ducks in the Conterminous United States_Outside Dates,Season Length and Bag Limits<ITAG tagnum="81">a. General Harvest Strategy</ITAG>Twenty-two of 24 persons making presentations at the public hearing addressedthe Service Regulations Committee's recommended frameworks for duck regulations.Of those addressing the recommended strategy for reducing harvests of ducks,11 offered qualified support, 8 believed that the recommended frameworksshould be more restrictive, and 3 believed frameworks proposed for theAtlantic Flyway were inappropriate and too restrictive.Mr. Eldridge Hunt, representing the Pacific Flyway Council, believed therecommended frameworks for ducks were reasonable for protecting waterfowlwintering in the Pacific Flyway. Mr. Dale Strickland, representing theCentral Flyway Council, Mr. Hugh Bateman, representing the MississippiFlyway Council's Southern Region, and Mr. Ken Babcock, representing theMississippi Flyway Council's Northern Region, supported restrictive regulationsbut objected that the Service had not indicated earlier that special strategiesshould be developed to further reduce harvests of mid-continent mallards.They further indicated that the Councils discussed the need for such furtheraction and would have been willing to try to develop regulations appropriatelyif the Service had provided such direction. Modifications of Council recommendationsby the Service Regulations Committee would result in inequities in harvestopportunities, an erosion of the point system, and potential for increasedharvests of several species. Mr. Leon Kirkland, representing the AtlanticFlyway Council, generally supported a strategy of reducing harvests onmost duck species, but did not believe that the degree of reduction shouldbe as great for the Atlantic Flyway as for other Flyways since a smallerproportion of Atlantic Flyway ducks are derived from the areas most stressedby drought and poor nesting conditions. Mr. Charles Potter, representingthe North American Wildlife Foundation, stated that ducks need protectionnow more than ever and if major restrictions are not implemented, credibilitywith hunters will be lost. He suggested that a level protection at leastequal to that given during the drought years of 1961 to 1964 would be appropriatethis year. Mr. Jack Lorenz, representing the Izaak Walton League, supportedthe recommendations of the North American Wildlife Foundation. Mr. JimPhillips, writer and duck hunter, believed that the proposed harvest strategyis not restrictive enough and recommended a general harvest reduction ofabout 50 percent. Mr. George Reiger, representing <T3>Field andamp; Stream </T3>magazine, voiced concern by his readershipover the status of ducks and need for restrictive measures, perhaps evenseason closures. Mr. Doug Inkley, National Wildlife Federation, generallysupported the season reductions proposed by the Service. Mr. Mike Berger,representing Ducks Unlimited, Inc., Mr. Steve Miller, representing theWisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and Mr. Roger Holmes, representingthe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, all expressed general supportfor the proposed strategy to reduce duck harvests. On behalf of the NationalAudubon Society, Mr. John Anderson supported the strategy to reduce huntingopportunity by at least 25 percent, but suggested some alternative measuresto accomplish this reduction. Mr. James Yoos and Mr. Stanley Nadler, representingthe New Jersey Waterfowler's Association, expressed concern that the proposedstrategy unfairly restricted the Atlantic Flyway and suggested that harvestreductions should be focused on the areas where the specific problems areoccurring. Mr. John Viser, representing the Berry Brooks Foundation, andcitizen Grayson Chesser both suggested that the strategy of reducing duckharvest by 25 percent, while commendable, is not adequate and both suggesteda reduction of 50 percent would be more appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Framework Dates</ITAG>Mr. Steve Miller, representing the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources,endorsed the proposed October 8-January 8 framework opening and closingdates for duck hunting. Mr. Doug Inkley, representing the National WildlifeFederation, endorsed the January 8 closing date. Mr. Leon Kirkland, representingthe Atlantic Flyway Council, recommended that the framework closing datebe January 15 instead of January 8, stating that the best hunting opportunityin the southern part of the flyway occurs after January 1, and citing previousexperience with a January 13 closing date which resulted in reduced harvests.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Season Length</ITAG>Representatives of eight organizations commented on the season lengthsproposed by the Service. Mr. Doug Inkley, representing the National WildlifeFederation, Mr. Charles Potter, representing the North American WildlifeFoundation, and Mr. Jack Lorenz, representing the Izaak Walton League,generally supported the Service recommendations for shorter seasons. Mr.Leon Kirkland, representing the Atlantic Flyway Council, while supportingsome reduction in season length, disagreed with a 25 percent reductionfor the Atlantic Flyway, citing the comparatively small proportion of prairie-nestingmallards, blue-winged teal and pintails (species which are most affectedby the drought) that are harvested in the Atlantic Flyway. Mr. Kirklandstated that only 2.8 percent of the harvest of prairie-nesting mallardsoccurs in the Atlantic Flyway, and percentages are similar to this forblue-winged teal and pintails. He noted that the predicted fall flightinto the Atlantic Flyway is not forecast to be significantly changed fromthat in 1987. He recommended that the season length in the Atlantic Flywaybe 35 days, which would be a 12.5 percent reduction from 1987. Jim Phillips,writer and duck hunter, recommended a 30-day season nationwide, while Mr.John Anderson of the National Audubon Society recommended a 25-day seasonnationwide. Mr. Roger Holmes, representing the Minnesota Department ofNatural Resources, asked that an additional 5-day reduction in season lengthin the Mississippi and Central Flyways, over and above the 25 percent reductionproposed by the Service, be considered if mallard point values were returnedto 35 points. Mr. Richard Bishop, representing the Iowa Department of NaturalResources, suggested that further reductions in season length would bepreferable to further reductions in the mallard bag limit.<ITAG tagnum="81">d. Closed Seasons</ITAG>Mr. Charles Potter, representing the North American Wildlife Foundation,and Mr. Doug Inkley, representing the National Wildlife Federation, endorseda season closure on canvasback and pintails. Mr. Bill Nickel, representingthe Eastern Shore Waterfowl Trust, called for consideration of plannedclosures for the purpose of stockpiling breeding ducks. He suggested thattargeting a closed season now for some future date would have hunter support.Mr. Lewis Regenstein, representing the Fund for Animals, provided writtencomment at the public hearing in support of a closed season.<ITAG tagnum="81">e. Bag Limits</ITAG>Messrs. Kenneth Babcock and Hugh Bateman, representing the MississippiFlyway Council, Mr. Dale Strickland, representing the Central Flyway Council,and Mr. Richard Bishop, representing the Iowa Department of Natural Resources,while recognizing the need for harvest reductions in mallards and otherspecies, opposed a decreased bag limit for mallard drakes from 1987. Thecomments were specifically directed toward the possible change in pointvalue under the point system. They generally believe that such a changeis not warranted because other restrictions being proposed, such as reducedseason lengths and framework dates, would accomplish the desired reductionin mallard harvest. They further suggest that such a change in point valuesis an attempt to force elimination of the point system and would actuallyredirect hunting pressure toward female mallards and other species. Messrs.Bishop and Babcock noted that the point system is more restrictive thanthe conventional bag limit and the reduced attractiveness of the pointsystem with a 70-point mallard drake will force some states currently selectingthe point system to adopt the conventional bag limit which, they believe,will result in a higher kill of mallard hens than under the point system.Mr. John Anderson, representing the National Audubon Society, recommendeda simplified 2-duck daily bag limit with no species or sex restrictions.Mr. Anderson noted that, while such a bag limit would seem to be a liberalizationon species and sexes for which only 1 is allowed at present, this wouldbe preferable to a complicated point system and would eliminate identificationproblems. Mr. Anderson cited studies from 1971 that suggested high pointbirds were discarded by hunters at a greater rate than low point birds.He also referred to a survey he conducted of more than 100 law-enforcementagents in which only two believed that the point system is enforceable.He further cited a recent analysis of the effectiveness of the point systemin directing hunting pressure toward drake mallards and away from henswhich concluded that the point system regulations have not successfullydone this.<T3> Field andamp; Stream </T3>Conservation Editor George Reiger identifieda number of problems with enforcement of and compliance with the pointsystem and suggested that the system was not working as intended.7. Extra Teal OptionMr. Leon Kirkland, representing the Atlantic Flyway Council, recommendedthat blue-winged teal be suspended as part of the teal bonus but requestedthat green-winged teal continue to be offered with 2 birds daily for 9consecutive hunting days. He stated that greenwings have been part of theextra teal bag in the flyway since 1979 without adverse effects and breedingpopulations are 46 percent above objective levels.14. Frameworks for Geese and Brant in the Conterminous United States_OutsideDates, Season Length, and Bag LimitsMr. Douglas Inkley, representing the National Wildlife Federation, endorsedthe proposed continuation of all goose frameworks, especially the conservativeregulations for certain populations of Pacific Flyway geese. Mr. RichardElden, representing the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, opposedreduction in Canada goose bag limits in the southeastern portion of theState to provide added protection to Tennessee Valley Population (TVP)Canada geese. Recent data suggest that some of these geese migrate to winteringareas in southern portions of the Atlantic Flyway, where populations aredeclining. Mr. Elden stated that Michigan has previously taken measuresto protect TVP geese by selecting shorter hunting seasons than the flywayframeworks permit and establishing a quota zone in one of the principalharvest areas to control harvest. Further, the State is establishing anew quota zone in another important harvest area this year. He requestedthat the bag limits be the same as last year.15. Tundra SwansMs. Jennifer Lewis, representing the Humane Society of the United States,stated that there is no justification for tundra swan seasons in the AtlanticFlyway. She indicated that the overall good population status and depredationon grain fields by tundra swans should not be used as reasons for encouraginghunting seasons on this species.Mr. Doug Inkley, representing the National Wildlife Federation, expressedsupport for tundra swan seasons proposed in New Jersey and Virginia andthe existing season in North Carolina.<ITAG tagnum="84">Written Comments Received</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>dated June 7, 1988 (53 FR 20874), the Servicereviewed comments on proposed season frameworks received from 48 correspondentsas of May 9, 1988. In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>dated July 11, 1988 (53 FR 26198), the Servicereviewed additional comments received through June 22, 1988. Since then,further comments have been received. Those received as of August 4 aresummarized here by regulatory topics arranged in the same order as in theMarch 9, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 7702).Regulations ProcessOne individual requested that the Service reevaluate the process for receivingpublic comments because some Mississippi waterfowl hunters reported theywere denied the opportunity to comment via telephone.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Shooting Hours</ITAG>In order to provide additional protection for ducks in 1988-89, the IllinoisDepartment of Conservation and one individual recommended restriction ofdaily shooting hours to include sunrise opening and pre-sunset closure.One waterfowl organization and one individual recommended either restrictingdaily shooting hours or allowing hunting only certain days of the week.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Frameworks for Ducks in the Conterminous United States_OutsideDates, Season Length, and Bag Limits</ITAG><T3>a. General Harvest Strategy_</T3>Because of concern about the statusof ducks and their habitats, Mississippi Department of Wildlife Conservationsupported reduction of the 1988 duck harvest by at least 50 percent belowthose during the period of stabilized regulations. Also, two individualsurged severe restrictions in hunting but urged all interested parties tocontinue to provide habitat for ducks. Another individual said that regulationsshould be made simple because he believed that complex regulations contributedto a decline in the number of hunters which in turn would result in reducedsupport for maintaining waterfowl habitats. Two individuals questionedwhether the governments of Mexico and Canada would impose restrictionson duck harvests comparable to those deemed necessary in the U.S.; and,if not, urged the Service to seek their cooperation in doing so.<T3>b. Framework dates_</T3>The Illinois Department of Conservation recommendedthat framework dates on both ends be shortened by 7-10 days. The MississippiDepartment of Wildlife Conservation, while supporting restrictions on duckharvests, believed that outside framework dates of October 8 and January1 suggested by the Office of Migratory Bird Management would disproportionatelyimpact southern States. In a subsequent letter, Mississippi supported theadoption of the Mississippi Flyway Council's proposed frameworks of October8 and January 8, although they believe a later framework closing date iswarranted.Four individuals, while supporting restriction of most regulations, urgedthat season ending dates be later, generally January 14 to 20, becauseducks tended not to arrive in the southern States until later in the year.c. <T3>Season length._</T3>The Illinois Department of Conservation, <T3>Sports Afield, </T3>one waterfowl organization, and three individualsrecommended reducing the length of the hunting season to help reduce theharvest of ducks. One individual and the Concerned Coastal Sportsman'sAssociation recommended longer seasons in the Atlantic Flyway to compensatefor hunting days lost because Sunday hunting is prohibited in many States.One individual and the Concerned Coastal Sportsman's Association recommendedlonger seasons in 1988-89. d. <T3>Closed season</T3>_Due to the depressed status of continental duckpopulations, current drought conditions, and expected low production ofyoung in 1988, 30 individuals, the Wisconsin Waterfowlers Association,the Wildlife Management Institute, and the North American Wildlife Foundation,provided written comment in support of a closed season. Many stated theiroverall commitment to duck hunting, but out of concern for the resourcethey urged the Service to cancel the duck season this year. One individualopposed a season closure until comprehensive harvest management plans havebeen developed with Canada and Mexico. Another opposed closing the duckseason for fear that the season would be kept from reopening. e. <T3>Bag limits</T3>_Eighteen written comments were received specificallyregarding bag limits. The Illinois Department of Conservation proposeda number of general hunting restrictions, including elimination of thepoint system. They also recommended a simplified bag limit of 3 ducks,only 2 of which may be of the same species and only one female of any species.Two individuals recommended a simple 4-duck daily bag limit nationwide,and two others suggested a simple 3-duck bag limit. Six individuals recommendedelimination of the point system, due primarily to difficulty with identificationof duck species and sexes or to a perception that the point system is moreliberal than a fixed bag-limit system. One individual suggested that thepoint value of pintails be increased to 70 or 100 points, while anothersuggested lowering the bag limit on pintails and mallards by 1 and eliminatingrestrictions on sexes due to identification problems with hens. The MinnesotaWaterfowl Association suggested raising the point value of mallard drakesto 55 to reduce the harvest. Three individuals called for general reductionsin bag limits. The Concerned Coastal Sportsman's Association recommendedthat the mallard limit be increased, and one individual recommended anincrease in duck possession limits to 3 times the daily bag limit due tothe long distances travelled and several days spent on hunting trips. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Black Ducks </ITAG>The New Jersey Waterfowler's Association, the Concerned Coastal Sportsman'sAssociation and one individual commented that regulations on black ducksfor the 1988-89 season should remain similar to last year or should beliberalized to 2 birds daily with a shortened season. They indicate thatblack duck numbers have remained stable and have reached population levelsthat exceed available wintering habitat. One individual called for a closedseason on black ducks. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Extra Teal Option </ITAG>The Concerned Coastal Sportsman's Association expressed their support forcontinuing the 2-bird bonus on green-winged teal during 9 days of the regularseason. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Special Scaup Season </ITAG>The Concerned Coastal Sportsman's Association requested a continuationof the 16-day scaup season outside the regular season dates. <ITAG tagnum="81">13. Duck Zones </ITAG>The Concerned Coastal Sportsman's Association requested the continuationof zoning in Massachusetts. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department askedthat zones be dropped in their State to simplify regulations and that theybe allowed to split their season 3 ways. The Kansas Department of Wildlifeand Parks expressed their opposition to the Service's position on zoning.They believe that if zoning has been allowed in some States, it shouldthen be available to other States pending an evaluation based on the establishedcriteria. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and one individualexpressed opposition to the Service's action to keep the western zone ofLouisiana in the Mississippi Flyway. They stated that this position isnot justified based on results of an extensive research study and thatfinal decisions were based arbitrarily on political motives. <ITAG tagnum="81">14. Frameworks for Geese and Brant in the Conterminous United States_OutsideDates, Season Length and Bag Limits </ITAG><T3>Atlantic Flyway. </T3>One individual recommended that the brant seasonbe increased to 50 days. The Concerned Coastal Sportsman's Associationalso recommended this increase and in addition, a longer Canada goose season.One individual recommended that goose hunting be permitted only duringthe latter part of each week. One individual recommended that the goosebag limit be increased to 3 in 1989-90. The Pennsylvania Game Commissionrecommended that the Canada goose bag limit be increased to 3 in the northwesternpart of the State around Pymatuning Reservoir. The Delaware Departmentof Natural Resources and Environmental Control recommended a special 13-daysnow goose season in October on and around Bombay Hook National WildlifeRefuge. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection recommendedthey be permitted to select brant and snow goose seasons separately withintheir respective duck zones. <T3>Mississippi Flyway. </T3>One individual supported the special earlyand late seasons to harvest local giant Canada geese in Michigan. One individualrecommended that if longer goose seasons are provided for Illinois, thesame season length be made available for the entire State rather than partof the State. <T3>Central Flyway. </T3>One individual recommended a later framework closingdate for Canada goose hunting in Texas. <T3>Pacific Flyway. </T3>Four individuals and the Oregon Farm Bureau recommendedthat the Canada goose season framework be extended to February 15 in partsof western Oregon, and the Farm Bureau recommended hunting only on alternatedays for geese and shooting hours beginning at 8:00 a.m. instead of 9:00a.m. <ITAG tagnum="81">15. Tundra Swans </ITAG>As of August 4, 1988, the Service has received nearly 2000 postcards andletters, nearly all from individuals urging that swans not be hunted. Mostcomments requested ``* * * not to lift federal restrictions on swan hunting.''following the wording in a flyer distributed by the National Humane EducationSociety (no address, phone number or date given). The New Jersey Waterfowler'sAssociation offered support for a limited season on tundra swans in NewJersey to reduce crop losses. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments </ITAG>Based on the results of recently-completed migratory game bird studies,and having due consideration for any data or views submitted by interestedparties, the amendments resulting from these supplemental proposals willspecify open seasons, shooting hours, areas, and bag and possession limitsfor waterfowls and coots. It is the policy of the Department of the Interior, whenever practicable,to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.The Director intends that finally-adopted rules be as responsive as possibleto all concerned interests. He therefore desires to obtain the commentsand suggestions of the public, other concerned governmental agencies, andprivate interests on these proposals and will take into consideration thecomments received. Such comments, and any additional information received,may lead the Director to adopt final regulations differing from these proposals.Special circumstances are involved in the establishment of these regulationswhich limit the amount of time which the Service can allow for public comment.Specifically, two considerations compress the time in which the rulemakingprocess must operate: the need, on the one hand, to establish final rulesat a point early enough in the summer to allow affected State agenciesto appropriately adjust their licensing and regulatory mechanisms, and,on the other hand, the unavailability before late July of specific, reliabledata on this year's status of waterfowl. Therefore, the Service believesthat to allow a comment period past August 25, 1988, is contrary to thepublic interest. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comment Procedure </ITAG>Interested persons may participate by submitting written comments on theDirector (FWS/MBMO), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of theInterior, Matomic Building, Room 536, Washington, DC 20240. Comments receivedwill be available for public inspection during normal business hours atthe Service's office in Room 536 in the Matomic Building, 1717 H StreetNW., Washington, DC. All relevant comments received on the late season proposals no later thanAugust 25, 1988, will be considered. The Service will attempt to acknowledgeall comments received, but substantive response to individual commentsmay not be provided. <ITAG tagnum="84">Nontoxic Shot Regulations </ITAG>In the June 28, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 24284), the Service published a finalrule describing zones in which lead shot is prohibited for hunting waterfowl,coots and certain other species in the 1988-89 season. Waterfowl huntersare advised to become familiar with State and local regulations regardingthe use of nontoxic shot for waterfowl hunting. <ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Consideration </ITAG>The ``Final Environmental Statement for the Issuance of Annual RegulationsPermitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FES-75-54)'' was filedwith the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) on June 6, 1975, and noticeof availability was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 13, 1975 (40 FR 25241). A supplementto the FES, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuanceof Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES88-14)'', was filed with CEQ on June 9, 1988, and Notice of Availabilitywas published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582), and June 17,1988 (53 FR 22727). <ITAG tagnum="84">Endangered Species Act Consideration </ITAG>Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act provides that, ``The Secretaryshall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programsin furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' ``[and shall] by taking suchaction necessary to insure that any action authorized, funded, or carriedout * * * is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such endangeredor threatened species or result in the destruction or modification of [critical]habitat * * *''Consequently, the Service initiated Section 7 consultation under the EndangeredSpecies Act for the proposed hunting season frameworks. On June 17, 1988, the Chief, Division of Endangered Species and HabitatConservation, gave a biological opinion that the proposed action was notlikely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or resultin the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitats.The Service's biological opinion resulting from its consultation undersection 7 of the Endangered Species Act is available for public inspectionin or available from the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservationand the Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12291, and the PaperworkReduction Act </ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>dated March 9, 1988 (53 FR 7702), the Servicereported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive Order. These included preparinga Determination of Effects and an updated Final Regulatory Impact Analysis,and publication of a summary of the latter.
