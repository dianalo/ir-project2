Hong Kong residents are increasingly bitter about the 52,000Vietnamese now in camps after sailing in rickety wooden boats fromtheir communist homeland in search of a better life.   And the boat people could become increasingly difficult tocontrol if Britain and Vietnam agree on a program that wouldforcible send most of them back.   ``I think the Hong Kong people in general are fed up with theproblem,'' said Allen Lee, the senior member of the LegislativeCouncil, which approves Hong Kong's laws. ``The reason for this isthe continuing influx.''   More than 23,000 boat people sailed into Hong Kong from May toJuly, an 84 percent jump from the corresponding period a yearearlier.   Resettlement of the Vietnamese asylum-seekers in third countrieshas lagged far behind, creating a crisis of accommodation for thenew arrivals.   Existing detention centers are overcrowded. Riots broke out intwo camps late in July, one after guards tried to prevent boatpeople from escaping through holes cut in the fence and anotherafter a squabble between Vietnamese women from rival groups.   ``When large numbers of people are kept cooped up in camps,particularly in hot weather, there is bound to be a great deal ofdiscomfort and frustration,'' Secretary of Security Geoffrey Barnessaid after the first disturbance.   Meanwhile, government plans to build makeshift camps to housethe flood of newcomers have met resistance from Hong Kongresidents. In the most recent example, scores of villagers pitchedtents on a construction site to stop work on a new detention centerin rural Sai Kung.   Reports of boat people escaping, of severe staff shortages atthe detention centers and alleged police brutality toward theVietnamese have added to the crisis atmosphere.   Raymond Chung, an official who represents a Hong Kong districtthat has a detention center, said his constituents now are moreconcerned about the boat people than the violent crackdown ondissent in Beijing, which has horrified this territory that returnsto Chinese sovereignty in eight years.   Ironically, the hardline stance against accepting the Vietnamesecomes as Hong Kong residents are demanding that Britain offer themrefuge because of the Chinese communist crackdown on the mainland.   ``I think the situation is completely different,'' Chung said.``We are claiming our rights'' as British subjects.   In an effort to end the flood of boat people, Britain decidedthat all Vietnamese arriving after June 1988, would have to provethey fled their homeland in fear of persecution or facerepatriation.   Negotiations with the Vietnamese government to set up a systemof forcible repatriation of Vietnamese who fail to qualify aspolitical refugees are under way. A Hong Kong government screeningsystem has determined that roughly four of every five arrivals willbe sent back.   The United States is among those criticizing forciblerepatriation and this has irritated some Hong Kong people. They saythe U.S. position, which they believe stems from a sense of moralresponsibility for its role in the Vietnam War, should be backed bypromises to resettle more boat people in the United States.   What affect the U.S. opposition will have on the program is notclear, but many Hong Kong people clearly hope repatriation beginssoon despite concerns of increased tension in the detention centers.   Boat people already have staged hunger strikes to protest plansfor forcible repatriation and hundreds of makeshift weapons havebeen found during searches of the camps. The U.S. Consulate in HongKong received a letter from one Vietnamese who wrote in blood:``Save my soul.''   While the number of boat people who have volunteered to returnto Vietnam has increased in recent weeks, they still account foronly a tiny fraction of the total population.   Chris Bale, the director of the relief agency Oxfam Hong Kong,sees a ``potentially explosive situation'' in the camps oncemandatory repatriation begins.   But he believes efforts should continue on a repatriationprogram so long as safeguards are in place to ensure that politicalrefugees do not have to return home and that people sent back willnot face persecution.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs Aug. 14</NOTE></DOC>
