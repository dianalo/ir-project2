Though it sounds like a Mel Brooks satire, author Richard SaulWurman believes thousands, perhaps millions, suffer from thecondition.   ``It's saying, `I just can't keep up.' It's that feeling ofpressure,'' said Wurman. ``You know it, I know it. Admit it,everyone does,'' says the fast-talking author of ``InformationAnxiety'' (Doubleday, $19.95).   ``It's that feeling that Jerry Smith down the street can puttogether the bicycle and you don't know how; that THEY can programtheir VCR to record things 14 days ahead of time and you can't ...that he's read the big, fat report sitting in your box and youcan't because it just doesn't make any sense, so you have to lieand say, `Oh yeah, that was a pretty good report.'''   That, says Wurman, is what society's latest high-tech malady hasdone _ turned humans into masses of lying, quivering jelly brains,too afraid to admit they don't know, or don't understand.   Wurman argues that information anxiety is a result of thesocietal demand that everyone become a well-rounded cultural being,coupled with the fact that much of the information being disperseddoes not really inform.   ``It's just stuff, or data, and I refer to it as thenon-information explosion.''   Wurman blames the education system. He says schools teach that``it's better to say, `I know' than `I don't know.' It's better toanswer a question than ask a question. ... A longer report is abetter report.''   His new book is aimed at calming anxiety sufferers by providingsuch down-to-earth, common-sense ideas as:   _ Allow that pile of periodicals stack up so high before rippingout individual articles of interest, thereby, reducing apreponderant pile to small stacks of what Wurman calls ``interestshards.'' The idea: less to look at, less anxiety.   _ Make a list of terms you use or hear often, but don't reallyunderstand (barometric pressure, the Dow Jones industrial average)and make a point to learn what they mean, one at a time.   _ Never nod your head at something you don't understand.Practice saying, ``I don't understand,'' in front of a mirror. Thesooner you admit you don't know, the sooner you can actually learn.   The book, admits Wurman, is full of a lot of things that peoplealways knew, but having them written in a book ``gives it the kindof justification to say it out loud for the first time.''   Wurman, who has an office in San Francisco and a loft-office inManhattan, is an architect by training but is better known as anarchitect of information.   ``I realize how ignorant I am,'' he said. ``I'm moreknowledgeable about my ignorance than perhaps anybody I know.''   ``When I don't understand things, I often do a book aboutthem,'' says the 53-year-old writer, who has turned his thirst forknowledge into a thriving business.   The result has been 26 ``Access'' books that include guides tothe 1984 Olympics, medical terms and his latest, a guide to TheWall Street Journal, which walks readers through a jungle offinancial jargon.   He also is responsible for revamping the Pacific Bell YellowPages, listing goods and services other than alphabetically _ byneighborhood and category, for example.   Though pessimistic about ending information anxiety, Wurmanbelieves that within a decade the nation's data dilemma will spawna new, multi-billion dollar industry: the understanding business.   ``Newspapers will begin hiring people not just to style theirnewspapers but to make them understandable,'' he said. ``Some boldnews program on television will do that, and we'll actually have aweather map that you can understand.   ``And business reports won't talk about M1s, M2s and M3s, whicheverybody thinks are bus lines. It will be information that peoplecan use.''   Because he understands this, he's gotten a jump on thecompetition and created a new business venture, The UnderstandingBusiness.   Now that's using common sense, which is what Wurman says hisbooks, his business and his life is all about.   ``I already told you,'' he says smiling, ``I'm not that smart.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
