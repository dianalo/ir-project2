Moody's cited Neoax's &quot;aggressive use of debt to finance growth.&quot; Last month, Neoax, a Stamford, Conn., maker of custom vehicles and military and industrial equipment, acquired IU International Corp. for $671 million. Louis A. Guzzetti, Neoax president and chief executive officer, said at the time that the transaction would boost Neoax's debt to &quot;well over $800 million&quot; from about $70 million. The ratings service said it expects Neoax to sell certain assets of IU International, a Philadelphia transportation and environmental services concern, to pay down debt. However, it said it expects Neoax to remain highly leveraged and to continue to make debt-financed acquisitions to attain its goal of reaching $1 billion in sales in the next two to three years. Neoax officials couldn't be reached for comment on the ratings change. </TEXT></DOC>
