JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush on Friday said the UnitedStates would hold an international workshop this fall to seeksolutions to global warning as a step toward reaching an eventualtreaty on the problem.   Environmentalists hailed the move as a step forward in singlingout global warming as a world environmental threat and reaching aconsensus on how best to deal with it. But they questioned whetherthe president was moving quickly enough.   In a statement, Bush said he expects the international workshipthe U.S. will host in October will ``lead to internationalscientific consensus on the seriousness of the (global warming)issue'' and to formal negotiations on a treaty to tackle theproblem.   The meeting will examine a range of financial, economic andtechnical issues that might be affected by worldwide curbs on therelease of so-called ``greenhouse'' gases into the atmosphere.These gases, mainly carbon dioxide and other pollutants associatedwith burning fossil fuels, are widely blamed for causing risingtemperatures.   William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,said the United States and 29 other countries agreed at a UnitedNations-sponsored meeting in Geneva on Friday that the workshopshould be the next step in dealing with global warming.   In a telex to Geneva on Thursday, the White House directed itsdelegation to the conference to press for the workshop, saying,``The scope and importance of this issue are so great that it isessential for the U.S. to exercise (a) leadership role.''   The administration has been criticized recently for failing totake the initiative on international environmental issues. Therereportedly has been internal disagreement on the urgency of theglobal warming problem and how aggressively to proceeddiplomatically on the subject.   One faction, which includes Reilly and Secretary of State JamesA. Baker III, has sought to move more rapidly toward developing atreaty. But White House chief of staff John Sununu has expressedreservations about moving too quickly before all of the economicand technical issues have been resolved, according to sources.   The administration's pronouncements brought mixed responses fromenvironmentalists.   ``It's a positive move by the president,'' said Rafe Pomeranzeof the World Resource Institute. But he said negotiations on atreaty likely would not even begin until late 1990 under theadministration's timetable.   Joseph Goffman of the Environmental Defense Fund said thepresident's recognition of the need to press ahead on a treaty is``forward progress'' but added, ``What we need is for the presidentto get out in front on this issue.''   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., a ranking member of the Senateenvironment protection subcommittee, said he welcomed the Bushinitiative and didn't feel the president was lagging behind otherworld leaders.   ``It's been clear from the start that he (the president) givesthis issue the highest priority,'' said Reilly, calling the fallworkshop ``a giant step'' toward getting an international consensus.   Reilly repeatedly has rejected suggestions that the globalwarming problem can be dealt with unilaterally. He has said anyprogress industrial nations make in reducing pollutants linked tothe warming process could be nullified without cooperation fromThird World nations as they develop their industries.   Scientists believe that global temperatures could rise by 4degrees to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next centurybecause increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other manmade gasesin the atmosphere will trap and retain heat from the sun in aprocess similar to what happens in a greenhouse.   Such a warming trend could melt polar ice caps and allow sealevels to rise, cause severe droughts and storms, and severelydisrupt the earth's biological systems.   Scientists at a Senate hearing earlier this week indicated theproblem may be developing faster than their computers hadpredicted. One government scientist raised a furor when hedisclosed that the administration had changed his testimony toapparently downplay the urgency of the matter.</TEXT></DOC>
