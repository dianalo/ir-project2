The penalty, which the company agreed to pay, was part ofa series of judicial and administrative actions brought bythe Environmental Protection Agency and the JusticeDepartment.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;These enforcement actions are part of a continuingnationwide campaign by EPA and the Justice Department to stoppeople from illegally putting hazardous wastes in theground,&quot; EPA chief William Reilly said. &quot;The restrictions areintended to significantly reduce the nation's reliance onland disposal of hazardous wastes in order to protectgroundwater and minimize risks of exposure to hazardouswastes.&quot;   EPA officials said Du Pont, among other things, unlawfullydisposed of corrosive acids and toxic solvents at its ChamberWorks facility in Deepwater, N.J. The settlement requires DuPont, in addition to the penalty, to perform an audit to makesure that facilities that ship waste to Chamber Works aredoing so properly.   Other enforcements action included:   -- A civil suit filed against Grumman Corp. that seeks apenalty of up to $25,000 a day for each of several allegedviolations. The company is charged with failing to determineproperly whether wastes were restricted from land disposaland failing to keep proper records on these wastes. It alsois accused of failing to provide proper notification torecipients of wastes that were sent off the site fordisposal. In Bethpage, N.Y., a Grumman spokeswoman said thecompany doesn't comment on pending litigation.   -- A $620,475 penalty sought against Boeing Co., which wasaccused of deficiencies in hazardous-waste training practicesand improper storage of hazardous wastes. A spokeswoman forthe Seattle-based aircraft maker said, &quot;We feel there areportions of the penalty that aren't justified and we plan tosubmit more information to, hopefully, amend the agency'sfindings&quot; and perhaps lower the penalty.   -- A $429,650 penalty proposed against Handy andamp; Harman,which was accused of having illegally disposed of spentsolvents and lead-bearing liquid wastes into a drainage ditchat its Archbold, Ohio, facility.   -- A $245,100 penalty proposed against Ciba-Geigy Corp.,which was accused of having failed to ensure that sludgegenerated from its wastewater treatment system was meetingrelevant standards, among other violations.   -- A $244,800 penalty proposed against Stone ContainerCorp., which was accused of having improperly disposed ofcertain wastes in lagoons.   -- A $197,230 penalty proposed against ABB Inc., which wasaccused of having violated notification requirements thatapply to shipments of waste acid.   All the proposed penalties are pending.   The EPA also issued notices of noncompliance to theUmatilla Army Depot in Hermiston, Ore., and the CharlestonNaval Shipyard in South Carolina. An inspection of the depotfound that it classified some waste incorrectly, failed tofill out proper notification forms and improperly storedcertain waste for more than a year. The EPA said the shipyardviolated certain restrictions on land disposal of waste.   EPA officials said the agency and the two facilitiesprobably will work out an agreement to bring the facilitiesinto compliance with federal law.   A spokesman for ABB, a unit of Swiss-Swedish group AseaBrown Boveri AB, said the company is looking into the EPA'scharges and won't comment on it pending further review.   Officials at Ciba-Geigy and Handy andamp; Harman couldn't bereached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
