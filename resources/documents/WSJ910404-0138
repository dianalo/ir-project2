In a quarter when almost every stock went up, making it tothe upper echelons of the fund performance charts meantbetting on some of the most volatile stocks around -- andgetting it right.</LP><TEXT>   For some of the winners, the game plan was to buy stockstrading at lavish multiples of earnings in hopes that thosemultiples would soon go even higher. In the case oftechnology and health care stocks, that's just what happened.   The expanding multiples translated into handsome gains inthe quarter for Fidelity Magellan Fund, Fidelity SelectBiotechnology and Delaware Group DelCap Fund Concept I.   But there was another way to score big. Bet on the dogs,such as the financial services companies and small-companystocks, and wait for the bounce. Sure enough, big gains werein store for Federal National Mortgage Association, whichranks as Fidelity Magellan's biggest holding, and the tinystocks owned by the American Heritage Fund.                                                                                                          FIRST-QUARTER LEADER                                                                                                          American Heritage Fund                       +54.17%                                                                                                          For years, the American Heritage Fund had a secure nichein the mutual fund industry's hall of shame.   The fund was the fifth-poorest performer in the 1970s,with a loss of 17.7%, and the second-weakest performer in the1980s, when it sank 43.1%.   The 1990s got off to an equally inauspicious start,despite a new fund manager. In February 1990, Heiko Thiemeacquired a 90% interest in the fund's management company for$10,000. At the time, American Heritage boasted assets ofless than $500,000.   &quot;How did I do the first year?&quot; asks the 47-year-old Mr.Thieme. &quot;I didn't do that great. It took me a while to turnthe fund around. I didn't kick all the positions outimmediately. Also, I was surprised by the Iraq situation.&quot;The fund slumped 30.8% in 1990 and continued to languishamong the industry's worst-performing funds.   But this year, the fund has come roaring back, returning54.17% for the first quarter. The gain was achieved with amixed bag of stocks, including American Business ComputersCorp., American Film Technologies Inc., Bloc DevelopmentCorp., Navistar International Corp. and RJR Nabisco HoldingsCorp.   &quot;The real kicker came from the smaller companies,&quot; saysMr. Thieme.   Mr. Thieme's forte is as a global stock market strategist.He reckons the dollar could climb to 1.80 marks later thisyear, and to two marks in the years ahead. He bases hispredictions on the relative domestic purchasing power of thedollar compared with the German currency. On that basis, thegreenback should be worth close to 2.40 marks, says Mr.Thieme; it is now around 1.67 marks.   Because of his concerns about a rising dollar, Mr. Thiemeis sticking with U.S. stocks. He reckons the Dow JonesIndustrial Average could climb to 3150 or 3200 this year asyields on long-term Treasury bonds drop to 7.5%, inflationsubsides and the economy starts to recover. For 1992, he isforecasting the Dow at 3500.   Even though Mr. Thieme is bullish on the U.S. market, henow has 20% of his fund's assets in cash. &quot;I feel the secondquarter will be a chance to buy several stocks cheaper,&quot; hesays. &quot;The first quarter will probably prove to be the bestquarter of the year.&quot;                                                                                                          12-MONTH LEADER                                                                                                          Fidelity Select-Biotechnology Fund            +92.12%                                                                                                          For Fidelity Select Biotechnology, success is summed up inone word: Amgen.   &quot;The {biotechnology} group tends to follow a bellwetherstock, which is Amgen, and I continue to be very bullish onAmgen,&quot; says Michael Gordon, Fidelity Select Biotechnology's26-year-old fund manager.   Amgen Inc. is the largest holding in Mr. Gordon's fund.Exactly how big, Fidelity won't say. But the latest report toshareholders, dated October 1990, puts Amgen at almost 7% ofthe fund's assets.   Since then, Amgen's stock has gone in only onedirection-skyward. In the first quarter, Amgen's stock morethan doubled, to $131.25 from $62.25.   As Amgen rises, Fidelity Select Biotechnology investorsget richer. The $520 million fund is up 92.12% in the past 12months, including an eye-popping 40.4% gain for the pastthree months alone. The fund has now been on a roll sinceearly 1989, with a total return of 191.7% in this 27-monthperiod.   &quot;It's unreasonable to think this is going to go onforever,&quot; says Mr. Gordon. But he thinks biotechnology stocksare still an attractive long-term investment. And the successof Amgen explains much of his optimism.   &quot;The incredible performance of Amgen is largely due tofinancial performance, not the sex appeal of the story,&quot; hesays.   Mr. Gordon reckons that Amgen earned about $1.75 a sharefor the fiscal year just ended. He estimates $3.25 for theyear ending in March 1992 and $5 in the year after that. Thestock closed yesterday at $130.25.   Mr. Gordon is betting that the company's newest drug,Neupogen, will be a big success. The drug, which helps toboost a patient's immune system, was approved by the Food andDrug Administration in late February. &quot;The real risk is thatthe `pickup' by doctors and hospitals is less than expected,&quot;says Mr. Gordon.                                                                                                          FIVE-YEAR LEADER                                                                                                          Delaware Group DelCap Fund                   +342.7%                                                                                                          Delaware Group's DelCap Fund Concept I has been tearing upthe track ever since it was launched in March 1986. The funddoubled investors' money in its first nine months, and thenwent on to easily outpace the average stock fund in everyyear that followed.   What's the secret of DelCap's success? Put it down toEdward Antoian's rigorous stock-picking style, which puts alot of weight on fast, consistent earnings growth and doesn'tmuch care what price tag the stock carries.   &quot;Some people call these `discovered growth stocks,' and Iwouldn't argue with that,&quot; says Mr. Antoian, 35, who has beenrunning $250 million DelCap Fund since its launch.   Mr. Antoian looks to buy stocks with market values ofbetween $100 million and $2.5 billion. Initially using acomputer, he hunts for companies that fall into the top 30%of all stocks in terms of rapid and consistent three-yearearnings growth.   That technique led him to buy such stock market favoritesas Home Depot Inc. and Novell Inc., both of which have beenlong-term holdings for the fund. Home Depot, the homeimprovement retailer, trades at 42 times earnings and Novell,which designs and makes local area computer networks, at 36times.   Do those sorts of lofty earnings multiples bother Mr.Antoian? Not much. Once a stock's earnings multiple exceedsits annual earnings growth rate, &quot;that lowers your toleranceto any possible disappointments,&quot; he says. &quot;But the highmultiple alone isn't a sell signal.&quot;   DelCap Fund's record got a big boost from its 1986results, when the fund leapt 103.7%. &quot;The fund was a lotsmaller in size, and we caught a handful of stocks dead on,&quot;Mr. Antoian recalls.   The fund also sparkled in 1987, when it was up 17.1%,largely because of a 40% cash position at the time of theOctober stock-market crash. But Mr. Antoian says that, overthe life of the fund, his results would have been even betterif he had stayed fully invested in stocks at all times.   &quot;If I've learned any lesson over the last five years, it'sthat I should stick with stocks and let somebody else be themarket timer,&quot; he says.   The record isn't so hot at the other fund Mr. Antoianruns, Delaware Group Trend, which has suffered from its focuson the smallest of small companies. The fund, which likeDelCap charges a 4.75% sales commission, was up just 38.9% inthe five years ended December 1990. Lately, however, the fundhas been on fire, rising 29.2% in the first quarter.                                                                                                          10-YEAR LEADER                                                                                                          Fidelity Magellan Fund                       +644.21%                                                                                                          When Morris Smith took over the helm of the $14.8 billionFidelity Magellan Fund on June 1, 1990, the pundits declaredthat the good times were over for the nation's largest andbest-known stock mutual fund.   Ten months later, the pundits must be feeling sheepish.Magellan may not be scoring the spectacular gains thatlegendary stock-picker Peter Lynch achieved in the late 1970sand early 1980s, when the fund was small and nimble. But asMr. Lynch's successor, Mr. Smith has been able to notch upthe sort of market-beating results that were the fund'shallmark in the latter part of the 1980s.   For the past three quarters combined, Magellan is up 10%,compared with 7.6% for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Indexand 6.3% for the average stock fund.   The fund's results were especially strong in the mostrecent quarter, with Magellan up a market-topping 20.2%.&quot;It's been a fun quarter,&quot; says Mr. Smith, 33. &quot;Technologyhas been a help, financial stocks have done well and thehealth care stocks have been terrific.&quot;   In recent months, Mr. Smith has been a heavy buyer ofGeneral Electric Co., which is the fund's third-largestholding, just behind Federal National Mortgage Associationand Philip Morris Cos.   Mr. Smith thinks GE will blossom as the economy comes outof recession. &quot;This company has a lot of leverage to changesin early-cycle industries,&quot; he says. Mr. Smith notes that GEis involved in such cyclical businesses as the manufacture ofpower-generation systems, aircraft engines and plastics.   Mr. Smith also thinks GE's stock is unusually depressed.&quot;The big cloud that was over the stock last year was thefinancial services business,&quot; he says. &quot;Hopefully, theperception on that will change as we come out of therecession.&quot;   Mr. Smith points out that GE's stock has typically tradedat an earnings multiple equal to or above that of the rest ofthe stock market. But recently, the company's stock has beentrading at just 15 times its most recent 12-month earnings,compared with an earnings multiple of almost 18 for theStandard andamp; Poor's 500.   Mr. Smith reckons GE will earn $5.20 to $5.25 a share thisyear, and $5.90 to $6 in 1992. GE's stock closed yesterday at$71.375.   Despite the stock market's sharp run-up in the past sixmonths, Mr. Smith has the fund's cash position at a slim 3%of assets. &quot;How do I feel about the market? Okay,&quot; he says.&quot;I don't think it's time to sell all your stocks and gohome.&quot;   ---       How the Biggest Mutual Funds Have Performed                                                                                                        Percentage gains for periods ended March 31; assets as ofDecember 31                                                                                                                        ASSETS     FIRST    TWELVE   FIVE    TEN FUND NAME   (in billions)  QUARTER  MONTHS   YEARS   YEARS                                                                                                                                                                                                               Fidelity Magellan Fund                 $12.3      20.2%     17.3%    93.7%  644.2%                                                                                                        Franklin Cust:US Govt                  11.4       2.7      13.4     54.2   228.4                                                                                                        Dean Witter US Govt                   9.8       2.1      10.2     44.8    N.A.
