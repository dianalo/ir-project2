Following Friday's weak jobs report, coming data on Augustindustrial production and capacity utilization are expectedto at best hover around July levels. And the much-awaitedinitial impact from the oil crisis hits the August producerprice index -- the consensus view calls for a jump of 1.3%,up from July's dip of 0.1%. A soft August retail sales reportis also in the cards, although the economic hand won't bedealt until Friday, when all the data are released. Theweek's only other major indicator is July consumer credit,due out today.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The whole economy is just hanging on by its toenails,&quot;said Lawrence Kudlow, economist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., NewYork. He said the weak employment data suggest real grossnational product could drop into the negative column in thethird quarter. One negative reading on GNP, or the totalvalue of the nation's goods and services, doesn't make arecession. But it could be an official starting point. Still,Mr. Kudlow is among the group that says the recession mayalready be under way.   &quot;Real business people have been telling me we're in arecession for six months. And that's good enough for me,&quot;said Mr. Kudlow. Still, he isn't a &quot;doom and gloomer&quot; andexpects only a short duration for any downturn.   Robert McGee, chief economist at Tokai Bank Ltd., NewYork, lowered his expectations for August industrial outputon the basis of the weak employment data. Mr. McGee nowexpects a decline of 0.2% in industrial production;previously he thought output would maintain July's flatreading. He also shaved his estimate for the related capacityutilization reading to 83.1% from 83.3%. In July, thenation's factories operated at 83.4% of capacity.   One forecast economists haven't changed much since theIraqi invasion of Kuwait: sharply higher producer prices.&quot;That's baked into the cake,&quot; said Mr. McGee, who expects ajump of one percentage point in wholesale prices.   Both producer and consumer price indexes are expected tosoar for a while. The August consumer price index, due outnext week, is expected to jump 0.8%, according to MMSInternational, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York. Buteconomists will also be keeping tabs on the inflation gaugesminus their volatile energy and food components. Excludingfood and energy, August producer prices are expected toincrease 0.3% and consumer prices 0.4%, according to MMS.   August retail sales are also expected to be soft, slipping0.1%, according to the consensus view. In July, retail salesgained 0.1%. Ironically, the energy crisis could help supportsales through higher gasoline-station receipts. Excludingautos, August retail sales are expected to increase 0.2%,about the same as in July.   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank,New York, said he's ratcheting down expectations for thethird quarter largely because of the weak employment data.Mr. Fine had been expecting GNP growth of 1% in the period,but now thinks a range of 0.5% to 1% is more realistic.   Still, he believes the quarter will manage to stay out ofthe red largely because of the giant service sector, whichhas stimulated job growth throughout this economic expansion.While service business employment has been slowing, &quot;it willstill carry us into the positive category&quot; for the quarter,Mr. Fine said.   ---              Closely Watched Reports                                                                                                              Statistics Released in the Week Ended Sept. 7                                                                                                                                                   CHANGE                             TOTAL     (FROM PRIOR PERIOD)                                                                                                        Money supply   M1 Week ended   Aug. 27 (in billions)       $815.4     -$2.2                                                                                                          M2 Week ended   Aug. 27 (in billions)     $3,304.7     -$0.7                                                                                                          M3 Week ended   Aug. 27 (in billions)     $4,091.3     +$3.9                                                                                                        Purchasing Managers' Index August change in percentage points              47.0%     - 0.4                                                                                                        Employment, payroll August (in millions)          110.67     - 0.7%                                                                                                        Construction spending July annual rate                                                                                                        Unemployment rate August, change in percentage points               5.6%     + 0.1                                                                                                        Auto sales Late August, total vs. year ago           257,241     -18.8%                                                                                                        New jobless claims Week ended August 25                    370,000     - 3.1%                                                                                                                   Statistics to Be Released This Week                                                                                                        Consumer credit (Mon.)
