Dear Mr. President:   I have the honor of addressing your excellency, first of all toinform you that today Nicarauga army troops crossed the borderlimits between Honduras and Nicaragua, attacking, with artilleryfire and combat aircraft support, locations situated in Honduranterritory in southeast Olancho department.   With the purpose of preventing the worsening of the situation onthe frontier, I have demanded of President Ortega that he order histroops to abstain from violating national territory, andimmediately redeploy to their territory the military units thathave invaded Honduras.   I have also communicated with Presidents Jose Napoleon Duarte,Vinicio Cerezo and Oscar Arias Sanchez to ask that they demand thatthe government of Nicaragua stop its aggression against Hondurasand remove the troops from the border region.   My government, exercising the right of legitimate defense,consecrated in Article 51 of the charter of the United Nations, hasproceeded immediately to execute the necessary actions to repel theinvasion of which it is the object, ordering its armed forces torepulse the troops of the Sandinista popular army.   In view of the unjustifiable aggression and the evidentdisadvantage in which, in terms of numbers of military forces andarmaments, my country finds itself in relation to the aggressorforces, my government finds itself forced to appeal for continentalsolidarity to repel the aggression of which it is subject and toreestablish peace in the region.   The actions taken by the invading army represent, beforeinternational law, an act of aggression that as a result should beconsidered as an attack against all the states of the Americancontinent.   Therefore, in conformity with what is established in the citedArticle 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, in articles 3, 8,and 9 of the Inter-American Treaty for Reciprocal Assistance; byvirtue of the special security relations existing between our twostates and the dispositions of the military assistance agreementthat was signed on the 20th of May 1954, I find myself required toask your illustrious government for effective and immediateassistance to maintain the sovereign and territorial integrity ofmy country.   I have the conviction that you share with me, Mr. President,that certainty that combined action by both nations is necessary todefeat this new aggression of the Sandinista regime.   The occasion is propitious to reiterate to your excellency theassurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration.   Signed,   Jose Azcona H.   President</TEXT></DOC>
