(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists looking for ways toprovide food, oxygen and sewage treatment for space travelers aregrowing wheat in a computer-controlled capsule that mimics Earth'secosystem.   The Kennedy Space Center scientists cultivated their garden byhand for about three years in the 12-by-23-foot ``biomass productionchamber,'' and then turned it over in mid-November to a computer.The computer makes sure that the wheat, growing hydroponically, getsenough light, air, water and fertilizer.   ``If you're truly, permanently going to space, you've got to havea system like this,'' says plant physiologist William Knott, head ofthe project.   Without such a system, Knott says, astronauts would need regularshipments of fresh air, potable water and prepared food _prohibitively expensive for any planned space habitats andimpossible for voyaging spaceships.   ``Sooner or later, we're going to get tired of sending TV dinnersout and bringing port-a-potties back,'' said agricultural engineerJohn Sager.   One problem is trying to cram enough of the important parts ofthe biosphere into a container small enough to fit in a spaceship,said Ralph Prince, another agricultural engineer. ``In the physicalworld, if you model a dam on the Tennessee River, you buildeverything smaller. When we model the biological process ... wecan't build people smaller.''   A life support system in flight might carry several staple cropssuch as wheat, rice, beans, soy, potatoes, peanuts and lettuce, andmight carry only 25 gallons of water. Astronauts would have torecycle water to stretch the supply.   Another obstacle is converting sewage into a fertilizer thatwon't kill the plants, which thrive on a carefully blended chemicalsolution.   A prototype life support system could be ready for a ground testby 1995, but it could be 2020 before a system would be available forflight testing, say National Aeronautics and Space Administrationscientists.</TEXT><NOTE>Women Control Labor Pain With the Push of a Button</NOTE><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Women may be only a button away fromcontrolling the severity of their labor pains during childbirth,according to a North Carolina researcher who studied aself-administered pain-killing technique.   The technique, patient-controlled epidural analgesia, lets awoman control the amount of pain medication she gets. Patients whoused it tended to use less than those who got medication from adoctor or nurse, said Steven Z. Lysak, who directed a study of 74women at Wake Forest University Medical Center.   In addition to potentially limiting fetal exposure to anesthesia,the self-administered technique provides a psychological advantageby increasing patient participation in the labor process,researchers said.   ``Using this technique, women safely and effectively treatedtheir own pain throughout the course of labor,'' said Lysak, whopresented his findings last year at the annual meeting of theAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists.   Patients who use the technique push a button to administer ameasured dose of a pain-relieving medication. A thin tube insertednear the patient's spinal cord in the lower back carries medicationto nerves and receptors. The device has a timer to prevent a patientfrom overdosing herself.</TEXT><NOTE>Researchers Develop Multichannel Stethoscope</NOTE><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A biomedical engineer and an anesthesiologistare working on a high-tech version of the stethoscope, with threesound pickups instead of the single amplifier doctors use to chilltheir patients.   The multichannel electronic stethoscope designed by Daniel Bensonand Jeffrey Joseph improves the doctor's ability to hear and monitorthe supply of oxygen to a patient's lungs during surgery, and letsthe anesthesiologist hear the heart and changes in breathing soundsfrom each lung.   The sound is amplified, filtered, mixed and transmitted to aheadset worn by the anesthesiologist, who can isolate each channelor hear all three.   It can help determine if an oxygen tube has shifted or isinserted incorrectly, or if a lung has collapsed, said Joseph, ananesthesiologist at Chestnut Hill Hospital. ``By using themultichannel stethoscope and comparing the sounds, you can recognizeproblems that much faster.   ``You can localize even a slight wheeze by turning up the volumeand come up with a good diagnosis.''   Joseph and Benson, of Thomas Jefferson University, have appliedfor a patent for their version of the device first invented in 1819by Renee Laennec, a French physician. The Patent Office says 324patents for stethoscopes have been issued in the United States,including 102 electronic versions and 173 with special acousticproperties.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Jan. 5</NOTE></DOC>
