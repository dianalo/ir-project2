Controversy is intensifying over whether the techniqueeffectively diagnoses soft-tissue injuries and should beadmissible in court as proof of injury. Insurance companies,particularly State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., andAllstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., arefighting the technique on two fronts: to bar its use asevidence in personal-injury suits and to avoid paying policyclaims for the tests.   The technique measures skin temperature using infraredphotography. Advocates say thermography takes &quot;pictures ofpain,&quot; pinpointing muscle and ligament damage, as well asnerve irritation that doesn't show up on other tests. &quot;It isone of the finest pieces of demonstrative evidence in court,&quot;says Harry Rein, a Florida physician and lawyer.   Critics claim thermograms aren't reliable because theyoften show signs of injury where none exists or fail todetect an injury.   Courts have ruled both ways on the issue. A Coloradoappeals court last summer upheld its use as evidence ofinjury in a suit, saying the defense didn't effectivelychallenge it, and a New Jersey judge has ordered insurers toreimburse patients for physician-ordered thermography.   But in March, a Maryland judge called the technique&quot;invalid&quot; and said State Farm didn't have to pay for it underthe personal injury protection clauses of auto policies.   Insurers, according to Dr. Thomas H. Ravin, a Denverorthopedist who uses thermography, &quot;have a great fear thereis something that can show people are hurt&quot; who aren't&quot;smashed to smithereens.&quot;                                                                                                          Sick of Legal Bills?   Then Do It Yourself   PEOPLE ATTEMPTING to handle legal affairs on their own arefinding a lot more tools at their disposal.   Publishers and software makers are catering to the legaldo-it-yourselfer with books and computer programs thatexplain how to manage simple legal matters such as anuncontested divorce or preparing a will.   &quot;A lot of packages and kits are on the market that weren'tthere five years ago,&quot; says George Milko of HALT, a legalreform group. A key reason for the interest is the high costof lawyers. &quot;Sometimes there's no choice,&quot; says Mr. Milko.&quot;For instance, a woman petitioning for increased childsupport may not be able to afford a lawyer.&quot;   &quot;Our growth has been phenomenal,&quot; says a spokeswoman forNolo Press, a legal self-help publisher based in Berkeley,Calif. Nolo said its sales are $5 million, up from $3 millionin 1988. Among its 60 or so titles, one of the top sellers isWill Maker, a software package that asks questions and thenplugs in the appropriate legal language for one's home stateand circumstances.   Another software package, Personal Lawyer Lifestyles,which is marketed by BLOC Publishing Co., Coral Gables, Fla.,includes a prenuptial agreement and a pact for unmarriedcouples who live together.   An American Bar Association spokeswoman says it has foundsome guides &quot;to be very good and others not so good.&quot;Potential drawbacks include &quot;not recognizing when you arehurting yourself or missing an opportunity.&quot;                                                                                                          Doing Business Abroad   With Fewer Restraints                                                                                                          COMPANIES in the U.S. are breathing easier about theirdealings abroad as a result of 1988 changes in the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act.   Amendments to the law, which covers business bribes,sought to make the standards for U.S. companies doinginternational business more workable and to rid the law ofambiguities.   &quot;Corporate executives and corporations certainly feel morecomfortable about the law now,&quot; says Robert Craft, anattorney with Sullivan andamp; Cromwell in Washington. The JusticeDepartment has yet to issue new compliance guidelines, butlawyers say they're getting far fewer inquiries from clientsworried about inadvertently breaking rules.   Now, companies break the law only if they knowingly makean illegal payment. Previously, companies broke the law ifthey &quot;had reason to know&quot; a payment was illegal. &quot;Greasepayments,&quot; formerly allowed only to low-level foreignfunctionaries, are now permitted to facilitate a routinematter, such as getting a visa or a permit, but not to get orkeep business. And it's proper to make payments allowed underthe written laws of a foreign country.   But the changes have far from eliminated the competitivedisadvantage that U.S. companies sometimes face abroad. Aftera European concern with Middle Eastern and Far Eastern unitswas taken over by a U.S. company, its foreign managers werestunned to learn that many of their common business practiceswere taboo, says Marc K. Ritzmann, an attorney withKilpatrick andamp; Cody in Atlanta. &quot;U.S. companies still oftenfind they can't engage in activities their local competitorsdo every day,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE FLORIDA BAR says neglect by lawyers is the most commongripe of unhappy clients. It said 23% of 7,175 complaints itreceived in fiscal 1989 came from people who felt theirattorneys neglected them. An additional 10% were distressedabout fees, and 9% said attorneys showed improper personalbehavior. . . .
