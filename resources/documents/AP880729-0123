South Korea's National Assembly has accepted a proposal fromNorth Korea for inter-parliamentary talks on a non-aggression pact.The North also agreed to discuss participating in the Olympics,which would end a potential threat to the Games scheduled forSeptember in Seoul.   Contacts would begin in August if terms can be worked out. TheSouth wants preliminary talks about an agenda but the North callsthat a waste of time.   Some South Koreans hope for a breakthrough to peaceful relationsor reconciliation. One National Assembly spokesman said: ``Ourposition is that we would try to accomodate the North's demand asmuch as possible.''   Hopes that talks could remove any North Korean threat to theOlympics may be premature. The North has not dropped its key demandto be co-host of the Olympics, holding some events on itsterritory, and may hope to force concessions.   A North Korean agreement to drop its co-hosting demand and takepart in the Olympics would be a stunning reversal of its position.   North Korea may be initiating talks in order to disrupt theOlympics by fostering uncertainty and tension up to opening day.The talks could become another test of nerves in a contest that hasoccupied the rival Koreas since the peninsula was divided at theend of World War II.   Past negotiations failed to ease tension. The last talkscollapsed in 1986 when the North pulled out in protest of routineU.S.-South Korean military exercises.   The Olympics are a pawn in the struggle for supremacy on thepeninsula and the North wants to be co-host in order to avoidlosing ground.   Each side claims to be the nation's sole legitimate government.They refuse to recognize each other and South Korea views the awardof the 24th Olympic Games games as world recognition of itssupremacy.   The International Olympic Committee rejects the North's demandto be co-host, saying the games are awarded to a single city andcannot be shared.   North Korea says the Olympics were awarded to the nation and thetwo sides can work out a co-hosting agreement. It rejected acompromise under which it could stage up to five of the sports ifit dropped the co-host demand.   In proposing negotiations, the government in Pyongyang may beseeking a face-saving reason for not participating in the games. Itcould accuse the South of preventing a unified Olympics and claimto have sought a solution until the last moment.   South Korea agreed to the talks because of its desire to easetension and protect the Olympics from disruption or violence.Officials in Seoul believe any kind of talks reduce the threat.   Many terrorist actions against South Korea have been blamed onthe North. It was implicated in the Nov. 29 bombing of a SouthKorean airliner, which killed all 115 people aboard.   Olympic and South Korean officials acknowledge privately thateven a small border clash in the next few weeks could frighten awayparticipants and spectators. The border is less than 50 miles fromSeoul.   Pyongyang has claimed South Korea and the United States areusing the Olympics to conceal preparations for a nuclear war, andthere are no signs that Kim Il Sung's regime has abandoned itsdesire to reunite the peninsula under communist rule.   Kim, who started the Korean War by invading the South in 1950,said again Thursday that the Olympics threaten the North.   ``The United States is reinforcing massive armed forces in andaround South Korea on the plea of guaranteeing `Olympic safety,'and at the instigation of the United States the South Koreanauthorities are maneuvering more blatantly than ever to keep ournation divided forever,'' he declared.</TEXT></DOC>
