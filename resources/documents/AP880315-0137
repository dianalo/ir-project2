Today, the 79-year-old Miss Hepburn, with her family'scharacteristic wit and keen intelligence, has taken on her mother'scause and become one of Planned Parenthood's staunchest advocates.   In a tribute Monday night, entitled ``Celebrating TwoGenerations of Individual Courage,'' the actress and her latemother, Katharine Houghton Hepburn, were honored by PlannedParenthood for their efforts to gain greater reproductive rightsfor women.   ``It's a frightfully important subject,'' the actress told the1,100 guests gathered at the Waldorf-Astoria for the black-tieevent.   ``And I'm damn lucky to have had a mother who waked me up at anearly age.''   Tickets for the gala were priced from $500 to $1,000, withproceeds going to Planned Parenthood dedicated to the actress'three priorities: keeping abortion safe and legal, preventing teenpregnancies and preserving family planning for the poor.   Former TV anchorman Walter Cronkite, tennis champion MartinaNavratilova, TV journalist Barbara Walters and actor RobertLindsay, star of the Broadway musical ``Me and My Girl,'' wereamong the participants.   As guests arrived, they encountered a small protest by the StopPlanned Parenthood organization.   Guests rose to their feet and applauded as Miss Hepburn,elegantly attired in a black pantsuit, approached the podium.   ``It's so touching to me, I can hardly begin to say what I haveto say,'' she said. But she had much to say.   ``When a girl becomes pregnant, should she be forced by law tohave this baby? She's 13. She doesn't want it. She can't supportit. Her family doesn't want it. It would seem to me that she shouldbe allowed to have an abortion.''   ``By the same token, if an older woman with several childrengets pregnant and feels that she can't support it or care foranother child, I cannot for the life of me see that anyone but thiswoman has the right to decide what she's going to do,'' MissHepburn said.   ``It's certainly much harder to be a woman than it is to be aman,'' she lamented. ``But men got here first and arrangedeverything to suit themselves. And it's taking women a long time to... try to catch up.''   Miss Hepburn became involved with Planned Parenthood in 1981.The group's president, Faye Wattleton, said she recruited herbecause she was ``someone who really had the public's respect.''Her participation in the organization has brought an additional200,000 donors and supporters.   It was only after the actress agreed to work for PlannedParenthood that, Ms. Wattleton said, she learned``serendipitously'' that Miss Hepburn's mother had been anoutspoken advocate of birth control at a time when it was illegal.   Mrs. Hepburn worked alongside Planned Parenthood founderMargaret Sanger more than 70 years ago.   A member of the Houghton family that founded Corning Glass, shetestified before the U.S. Senate in the 1930s on the need for birthcontrol, particularly for poor women.   ``Women want children but they want children they can properlytake care of,'' she testified. She died in 1951 at age 73.</TEXT></DOC>
