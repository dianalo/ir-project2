Garcia</HL><DD> 06/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK INDEXES (NDX)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices didn't plunge after Tuesday's record close, as they have after other record-setting days, but they didn't rise either.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed unchanged at 2407.35, even with the high set Tuesday. The industrial average traded in a narrow range throughout yesterday's more active session. The average showed a gain of nearly 10 points a few minutes before the closing bell, but profit-taking wiped it out, traders said.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.05 to 304.81, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.09 to 171.44 -- both indexes surpassed highs set Tuesday.    Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the Big Board by a margin of 13; the final tally was 796 to 783. Volume expanded to 184.7 million shares from 157.8 million shares.    While investors didn't rush in to buy stocks after Tuesday's record-breaking close, traders were thankful investors didn't sell as they often did last year. Three times in 1986, the Dow Jones Industrial Average established a record and took a historic nose-dive a few days later.    A firmer dollar and higher bond prices, two factors that often stir up buying interest among stock investors, hardly roused the market.    Traders blamed the tentative mood on tomorrow's quarterly expiration of stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks. These triple witching hours have produced huge price and volume swings in the past. This time around, some contracts, most importantly the actively traded Sandamp;P 500 index futures contract, will use tomorrow's opening prices for settlement. Trading will end today. Some contracts will still expire at the end of trading tomorrow.    Regulators and exchange officials believe it will be much easier to deal with big order imbalances at the opening. But because the new procedures are far from uniform, some traders believe there could still be plenty of confusion for investors.    &quot;There's still potential for big gyrations in stock prices, and a lot of people don't like to expose themselves to those big moves,&quot; said Jon Groveman, head of equity trading at Ladenburg Thalmann in New York.    Stock market investors largely ignored yesterday's news that the U.S. industry operating rate rose to 79.6% in May from 79.4% the previous month and that the nation's gross national product expanded at a revised annual rate of 4.8% in the first quarter. First-quarter GNP growth was originally reported as a 4.4% rate.    Some economists believe that overstocked inventories could depress GNP growth in the current quarter. But they think that an improvement in the trade deficit might help GNP growth rebound the rest of the year.    Monte Gordon, director of stock research at Dreyfus Corp., said that although the market is at a high, investors still have to face less than robust economic growth, a huge budget deficit and the wide trade gap. He worries that the recent strength in the dollar might undo some of the trade deficit's recent narrowing.    Atlantic Richfield rose 1 3/8 to 93 7/8 in active trading. Arco said it was considering selling a partial interest in its Arco Chemical unit to public investors.    Eugene Nowak, analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the Arco move is an example of what he believes to be the start of another restructuring move in the oil industry. He noted that Pennzoil is considering some action; Occidental Petroleum and Kerr-McGee are already in the midst of restructuring.    He believes company managements realize they still have some valuable assets to which they want to call attention. Trying to demonstrate an effort to maximize shareholder value is also on their minds, Mr. Nowak said.    Other oil stocks were little changed. Exxon inched up 1/4 to 89 3/4, Phillips Petroleum remained unchanged at 16 1/2, Chevron fell 1/4 to 59 5/8 and Mobil rose 1/4 to 50 3/4. Crude oil prices continued to climb above $20 a barrel, with July crude gaining 12 cents to $20.39 in the futures market.    Du Pont rose 3 5/8 to 119. Analysts think the company stands to benefit if further tests continue to show success with its anti-AIDS drug, Ampligen.    First Boston fell 1 to 44 3/4. The Wall Street investment bank said late Tuesday that it expects to report a second-quarter loss, reflecting trading setbacks in fixed-income securities in April and May.    Other brokerage stocks didn't do much better. Morgan Stanley sank 1 3/8 to 72 1/8, Salomon dropped 1 to 34 3/4, E.F. Hutton was unchanged at 39 7/8, Merrill Lynch eased 1/8 to 36 5/8 and PaineWebber inched up 1/8 to 33.    Foster Wheeler rose 5/8 to 20 3/8 on trading of more than 1.8 million shares. Traders said takeover rumors have stirred up demand for the stock in recent sessions and driven up the price from around 15 in late May.    Gillette gained 3 to 37 on more than 1.9 million shares. Renewed takeover speculation was the reason cited by traders for the price gain.    Unilever N.V. was mentioned as a possible suitor. Another rumor had Gillette considering a leveraged buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.    A new offering of Nuveen Municipal Value, a new closed-end fund, was the Big Board's most active issue, as more than 18 million shares changed hands. The shares traded at 10 throughout the day, unchanged from their initial offering price.    Noting the even price for the Nuveen fund, traders said underwriters will usually buy back shares from investors after a new offering is brought to market in an attempt to stabilize the price.    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph rose 1/2 to 27 3/4 on trading of more than 6.4 million shares. Traders said the stock has been recommended in recent days by several Wall Street firms.    According to Dow Jones News Service, the recommendations follow a company filing with the Federal Communications Commission that indicates that ATandamp;T's communications operations had a better-than-expected performance in April. Some analysts believe that ATandamp;T's long-distance telephone business might be deregulated sooner than expected.    Transco Energy fell 3 1/8 to 36 7/8 in active trading. The company said its Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line unit would be temporarily closed to some traffic because of federal rules. Transco expects the unit's revenue to decline during the closed period, resulting in an operating loss for the unit in 1987. Transco Exploration Partners dropped 1 1/2 to 14 1/8.    Jim Walter eased 3/8 to 54 5/8. The company reported earnings for its quarter ended May 31 rose to $1.15 a share from $1.01 a year earlier.    Reynolds andamp; Reynolds slid 3 1/4 to 33 1/4 in over-the-counter trading. Goldman Sachs lowered its earnings estimate for the company and downgraded the stock. Goldman expects third-quarter earnings to be hurt by start-up costs from Reynolds's new line of ERA computers. </TEXT></DOC>
