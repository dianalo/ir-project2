But like so much else connected with high technology, thatpledge is easier made than redeemed.   It's true that a laptop computer equipped with a modem --a telephone-like device for sending data over phone lines --can transmit and receive documents over almost any phoneline, giving it the potential to function as a remotebusiness center. All you have to do is connect the machine,using a standard telephone wire, to a modular phone jack, andthen dial up your office computer using your communicationssoftware.   But getting those connections to work often takes muchmore experience and technical skill than the computer adssuggest.   I learned this the hard way. For several years I traveledaround the world for this newspaper covering the secretary ofstate. The reporters aboard his plane were supposed to bepondering great world events, but we often had to focusinstead on how to get our laptops to work from varioushotels. One highlight of our journeys occurred in Moscow whena Cable News Network reporter finally linked his laptop PC toCNN's Atlanta headquarters by yanking the phone wires out ofthe wall in our hotel and wiring his modem directly intothem.   You don't have to go to such extremes to hook up a laptopin your hotel room. But you must overcome two basicobstacles.   First, the telephone hardware in hotels is often hostileto making connections. Spare phone jacks are rare; thosealready in use for the phones are often hidden behind heavyfurniture; and some phones are wired directly into the wallwithout a plug-in phone jack.   Second, the system for making calls can be complicated,sometimes requiring that all calls go through an operator oruse a long string of numbers. That can make it tough to setup your software to dial into the home office.   So, here are a few tips from a seasoned laptop lugger thatmight help you overcome these hurdles. Most of this advicealso applies to portable fax machines.   -- Look for a hotel that provides spare phone jacks. Theseare still rare but are growing in number. One example is thenew San Francisco Marriott.   -- Failing that, always carry three inexpensive items: along spare phone wire, a coupler to connect two phone wiresand a Y-adapter -- a gizmo that lets two phone wires pluginto a single jack. With these three things, available for afew dollars each at Radio Shack and similar stores, you canusually avoid using the wall jack at all. For instance, youcan plug the Y-adapter into the back of the phone and thenplug both the line from the wall and the line to your PC'smodem into it.   -- For hotels where the phone is permanently &quot;hard-wired&quot;to the wall and you can't plug anything in, consider buyingtwo costlier devices. One is an acoustic coupler, whichconnects your modem to the phone's handset via rubber cupsthat fit over the mouth and ear pieces.   The other is a special connector that fits between thehandset and phone and provides a phone jack for your modem.One source for these gadgets is Unlimited Systems of SanDiego, which makes both types of devices in the U.S. andsells them under the Konexx brand name. Each costs $80 to$150.   -- Make sure before you leave that you have communicationssoftware that can accommodate long phone numbers. Hotelsoften require that guests use extra digits when callingoutside lines. Some programs will let you set up an automaticdialing entry that conforms to the hotel's particular system,so the computer can just dial away. Hint: You can buildpauses into these programmed phone numbers using commasbetween the digits. That way the computer will wait for anoutside dial tone before proceeding.   -- Also try to learn how your software can be set up tohandle situations where you dial on the phone itself or givean operator a credit card number orally. This can be trickyand may require a close reading of the software manual.   -- If your company's computers aren't set up to be dialeddirectly, you can subscribe to a public service such as MCIMail. The service will assign you an electronic mailbox intowhich you can deposit documents from your laptop computer.Then, your associates back home can call the same service andretrieve the documents from the mailbox for use at theoffice.   -- Instead of toting a printer along on trips, considerequipping your laptop with a &quot;fax modem&quot; -- a modem equippedto send faxes. Then, if you want a printout of something onyour laptop's screen, just send it downstairs to the hotel'sfax machine.   They don't teach things like that in business school. And,in an ideal world, you shouldn't have to know about them. Butfor now, keep in mind that using a hotel room as a computercenter usually takes some extra effort.</TEXT></DOC>
