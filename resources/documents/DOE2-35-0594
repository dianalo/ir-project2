<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-0594 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effects of changes in solar and geomagnetic activity on the majorplasma-sheet ions are investigated on the basis of a statistical analysisof 1500 h of data obtained at distances 10-23 earth radii and energy/chargeratios 0.1-16 keV/e by the ISEE-1 energetic-ion mass spectrometer. Theresults are presented in extensive graphs and discussed in detail. Itis found that substorm activity is accompanied by a significant decreasein the density of solar-origin H(+) ions, a sharp increase in the energyper nucleon of both H(+) and He(+) ions, and an increase in the densityof terrestrial O(+) ions. A factor-of-three increase in the overall O(+)density over the observation period is attributed to an increase in thesolar EUV flux. 17 references.</TEXT></DOC>
