This section requires the Secretary of the Interior to review,in accordance with section 3(d) of the Wilderness Act, all lands in refugesin Alaska not Congressionally designated as wilderness as to their suitabilityor nonsuitability for preservation as wilderness and report Departmentrecommendations to the President.Although large tracts of land in the refuge were found to meet the criteriaof the Wilderness Act for designation as wilderness, not all of these landswere proposed for wilderness designation because of management strategiesthat will be used to meet refuge purposes. As a result, a range of wildernessalternatives were evaluated subsequent to the Service's selection of itsproposed management alternative. Five wilderness proposals, ranging fromrecommending all suitable refuge lands for wilderness designation to recommendingno additional lands for wilderness designation, were examined in the KenaiRefuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan/Environmental Impact Statement/WildernessReview. The proposed alternative in the plan recommended that an additional195,500 acres be proposed for designation as wilderness.The wilderness review in the Kenai Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan/EnvironmentalImpact Statement/Wilderness Review discussed the wilderness suitabilityof lands on the refuge, but did not clearly outline which of these landsthe Fish and Wildlife Service would propose for inclusion in the President'swilderness recommendations to Congress. To ensure full compliance withthe Wilderness Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service has prepared this SupplementalEnvironmental Impact Statement, clearly discussing the proposal for wildernessdesignation on the refuge.All agencies and persons wishing to comment are urged to do so as soonas possible. However, all comments received by the date given above willbe considered in preparation of the Final Supplemental Environmental ImpactStatement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 23, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Bruce Blanchard,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Environmental Project Review.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-12389 Filed 6-2-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-55-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
