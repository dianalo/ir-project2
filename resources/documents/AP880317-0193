CAMPBELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of anti-apartheid activists called onthe South African government Wednesday to commute the deathsentences of six blacks who were involved in a 1984 demonstrationduring which a black deputy mayor was killed.   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women anda member of the Free South Africa Committee, said the government ofPrime Minister P.W. Botha was using the death penalty in an effortto intimidate the country's black protest movement.   She likened such tactics to those of Nazi Germany, contendingthat the Pretoria government is ``on the road to totallyobliterating all blacks except those who accept slavery.''   Secretary of State George P. Shultz telephoned South AfricanForeign Minister Roelof (Pik) Botha to protest the plans to executethe six, department spokesman Charles E. Redman said.   A protest also was delivered to the South African government byU.S. diplomats in Pretoria.   ``As the president said yesterday, we do hope that the SouthAfrican government will heed this call for clemency,'' Redman said.   Speaking at a news conference, Yard urged Congress to approvestronger sanctions and require total withdrawal of Americanbusiness interests from South Africa.   NOW was joined at the session by representatives fromTransAfrica, the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights andthe National Conference of Black Lawyers, as well as aides topresidental candidate Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Rep. MervynDymally, D-Calif., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.   The groups praised the Reagan administration for joining theBritish and West German governments in asking for clemency in atelegram to Botha.   At the same time, they urged President Reagan to end diplomaticrelations with South Africa and ask the Western allies to join in atrade embargo.   ``We've seen what this government can do against Poland andPanama,'' Yard said ``Why not South Africa?''   The South African prisoners, known as the Sharpeville Six, wereconvicted in the Sept. 3, 1984 killing of black township councilorJacob Dlamini in Sharpeville, about 40 miles south of Johannesburg.   Evidence at their trial indicated that the six were not amongthose who hacked and burned Dlamini to death. They were convictedunder the doctrine of ``common purpose,'' which holds that theywere responsible for the killing by being part of the mob thatgathered outside of Dlamini's home with intent to kill him.   Michael Prosper, of the lawyers committee, told the newsconference that Dlamini, who refused to leave his home when SouthAfrican police tried to take him to safety, had incited violence byfiring several shots into the crowd.   The plea for clemency also is supported by AmnestyInternational, the United Auto Workers, the National CoalitionAgainst the Death Penalty, the National Council of Churches andother national religious groups.</TEXT></DOC>
