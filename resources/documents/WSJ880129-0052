Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   Takeover battles and two brightening economic trends roused investors to move into the stock market yesterday, sending prices higher in moderately active trading.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 18.90 points to close at 1930.04. New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 164.4 million shares, off from the 176.4 million shares that changed hands Wednesday. Advancing issues led losers, 1,084 to 419.    &quot;The takeover business seems to be back in vogue,&quot; said Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers. &quot;That tends to make everybody a 'hoper.' They figure that Sterling went to Kodak, so they'll go out and buy maybe five other drug stocks in hopes one of them will get taken over, too.&quot;    He also said that with interest rates easing and commodity prices falling, investors have a more positive light in which to view stocks. &quot;The market is propelled by psychology, and the overall psychology is changing somewhat toward the positive,&quot; he said. &quot;Buyers are getting more aggressive, and sellers are drying up. If we can keep the wild gyrations caused by program trading out of the market, investors can look at stocks for their fundamentals and the market can get back to basics.&quot;    Still, some analysts aren't convinced that investors are willing yet to return to the stock market in any great numbers. &quot;Perceptions are running pretty haywire right now,&quot; said Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.    Mr. Peroni said he has detected three distinct psychological phases among investors since the first of the year. The first phase, he said, was &quot;a hyperfocus on the November trade deficit&quot; that frightened investors away from stocks. It was followed by a second phase of sweeping disappointments with fourth-quarter earnings reports, especially those of International Business Machines and Digital Equipment.    Now, he said, investors are looking at the breakup value and takeover potential of companies. That focus on takeovers may provide some boost to stock prices, he said, &quot;but the flow of cash into the market is erratic and lopsided. There isn't a well-diversified environment in which investors can act.&quot;    Some market analysts are looking abroad for hints of where the domestic stock markets may be headed. Gary Dorsch, an analyst at LNS Financial Group in Chicago, said sharp gains recently in the Tokyo market may bode well for the U.S. stock market.    Mr. Dorsch said he thinks Japanese equity traders are beginning to bet that the U.S. dollar is stabilizing. He noted that some of the biggest gains on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lately have been in export-oriented and financial stocks. A stable dollar would help keep interest rates low, making a better investment environment for U.S. investors, as well as enticing Japanese and European investors back to the U.S. stock market, he said.    IBM gained 1 to 113 3/4 after disclosing a wide-ranging reorganization plan. Most other technology stocks also rose. Digital Equipment closed up 5/8 at 123 5/8, Teledyne gained 3 1/2 to 309, Motorola was up 1 1/8 to 41 7/8, NCR picked up 1/2 to 55 3/4, and Hewlett-Packard rose 1 1/8 to 56 1/4. Unisys dropped 3/8 to to 32 3/4.    Xerox fell 1 7/8 to 55 after reporting improved fourth-quarter results. Chairman David Kearns told security analysts that he expects Xerox to have a good year in 1988, barring any major economic distortions.    Aluminum stocks fell. Aluminum Co. of America was off 1 3/8 to 40 7/8, Reynolds Metals lost 1 3/8 to 39 1/8, and Alcan Aluminium dropped 7/8 to 25.    A strong fourth-quarter earnings report from Delta Air Lines boosted airline issues. Delta gained 3 1/4 to 43 1/4, AMR rose 2 1/4 to 36 3/4, NWA closed up 1 5/8 at 39 3/4, and Southwest Airlines was up 1 to 14 7/8.    Du Pont gained 5/8 to 81 and Dow Chemical rose 1 1/8 to 78 1/2 on improved fourth-quarter results.    Neiman-Marcus slipped 1/2 to 13 3/4. A Montgomery Securities analyst changed his investment rating to &quot;sell&quot; from &quot;hold,&quot; and lowered his earnings estimate for the retailer.    F.W. Woolworth rose 7/8 to 40 1/2. A spokesman said the activity might be the result of investors taking profits from Federated Department Stores stock and moving them into Woolworth. Federated, which is facing a hostile tender offer of $47 a share from Campeau Corp., gained 1 to 51.    Public Service of New Hampshire was unchanged at 2 5/8. The company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code after the stock market closed.    Tenneco was the most active issues on the Big Board. It closed down 1/8 at 40. The company said it is taking a $250 million charge for the fourth quarter for settlements of contract liabilities incurred by its natural gas pipeline subsidiary.    IU International gained 1/2 to 19 3/4. The company rejected Neoax's tender offer of $17.50 a share as well as Neoax's conditional proposal of $19 a share and proposed a restructuring plan that would provide shareholders with $14 and a new share of IU common for each current share.    American Standard lost 5/8 to 58 1/4 in heavy trading. The company is studying a $56-a-share tender offer from Black andamp; Decker, which slid 7/8 to 18 5/8.    Coca-Cola Enterprises lost 1/8 to 14 3/4. It said it will buy certain bottling operations from Coca-Cola Co. for about $500 million. Coca-Cola gained 3/4 to 37.    Monsanto edged up 1/8 to 83 5/8. The Food and Drug Administration said it intends to evaluate the &quot;regulatory status&quot; of the company's cholesterol-free fat substitute announced Wednesday. Monsanto had said the new product wouldn't need FDA approval because it is made from existing products considered safe.    Procter andamp; Gamble, Monsanto's rival in the fat-substitute business, gained 1/4 to 84 1/2. Its product, called Olestra, must be approved by the FDA. </TEXT></DOC>
