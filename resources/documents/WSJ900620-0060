Gordon Crovitz</HL><DATE>06/20/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A15</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><LP>   There is a phrase even more horrifying to trial lawyersthan Case Dismissed. This is Rule 11 of the Federal Rules ofCivil Procedure. What sounds like a technicality is thecountry's most effective deterrent against frivolous cases.It hits abusive lawyers where it hurts -- in the pocket.There's even a former attorney general among the errantlawyers fined under this rule.   The adoption of a toughened Rule 11 by the courts in 1983was a formal admission that litigation was out of control.The rule says judges &quot;shall&quot; assess fines on lawyers who filecourt papers that are not &quot;well grounded in fact&quot; or&quot;warranted by existing law&quot; or are &quot;to harass,&quot; &quot;causeunnecessary delay&quot; or &quot;needless increase in the cost oflitigation.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Wags may say this covers most cases, but it wasn't untilthis term that the Supreme Court issued detailed opinions onRule 11. In one case, the court said only the lawyer whosigns the offending legal paper is liable, not his law firm.The second case, earlier this month, bashed lawyers for amenswear business who filed a frivolous class-actionantitrust claim against Hartmarx as part of a contractdispute. The court said the lawyers were liable for $21,000even though they had withdrawn the lawsuit. In an 8 to 1opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor rejected the argumentthat Rule 11 &quot;chills creative litigation.&quot; She said trialjudges need the discretion to punish lawyers as a way of&quot;curbing abuses of the judicial system.&quot;   This comes after the justices in May refused to hear theappeal of former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who faces anot-yet-determined fine. Mr. Clark, who served underPresident Johnson, represented Libyans who sued PresidentReagan and Prime Minister Thatcher for their role in the 1886bombing of Muammar Qadhafi's headquarters. Guess the allegedoffense? Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher were accused of beingRICO racketeers.   Not too surprisingly, the trial judge found that the &quot;caseoffered no hope whatsoever of success, and plaintiffs'attorneys surely knew it.&quot; The appeals court in Washingtoninsisted on a fine, saying that &quot;we do not conceive it aproper function of a federal court to serve as a forum for`protests,' to the detriment of parties with serious disputeswaiting to be heard.&quot;   Politics and the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations law make a heady brew for Rule 11. The ChristicInstitute RICOed a long list of defendants, including retiredGen. John Singlaub, for running drugs, committing murder,etc., and helping the Nicaraguan Contras. Federal JudgeLawrence King of Florida last year said the case was&quot;unsubstantiated rumor and speculation from unidentifiedsources.&quot; He ordered Christic and its chiefconspiratorialist, Daniel Sheehan, to pay $1 million towardthe defendants' legal bills.   Radical lawyer William Kunstler, a lawyer from a Christicaffiliate and a law professor were fined $120,000 last year.Part of their defense of two Indians who took hostages in aNorth Carolina newspaper office was to accuse top stateofficials of various civil rights offenses and allege that asheriff ran drugs. Judge Malcolm Howard called it allfrivolous, &quot;not to vindicate constitutional rights, but moreprobably to gain publicity.&quot;   Political cases aside, many Rule 11 sanctions are topunish efforts to coerce deep-pocket defendants to paysomething, anything, to be rid of a nuisance case. Last yeara law school graduate sued Capital Cities/ABC for $2 millionplus 1,000 shares. The firm's offense? Requiring him to buy asurety bond before it replaced certificates for two shares helost worth $243.   New York business law has long allowed firms to demandbonds to indemnify against possible claims, but the plaintiffsaid this amounted to &quot;unconscionability&quot; and even claimedemotional distress. A New York court said this wasridiculous, noted that the plaintiff had &quot;a long history ofbringing baseless claims in a variety of forums,&quot; and finedhim $5,000.   Here's another howler. In 1984, a lawyer sued SanFrancisco for violating his free speech and equal-protectionrights when police officers stopped his softball game in anoff-limits part of a park. &quot;Plaintiff does not allege anyfacts suggesting communicative expression or symbolic conductsufficient to fall within the scope of the First Amendment,&quot;Judge William Schwarzer ruled. &quot;There is no indication thatpersons observing plaintiff playing softball in Golden GatePark would understand his conduct to be a message `about theright to democracy in recreation as opposed to elitism.'&quot; Hefined the plaintiff $50,000.   Only a minuscule fraction of the 250,000 civil cases filedeach year in federal court (or in the 38 states with similarrules) result in sanctions. Fordham law professor GeorgeneVairo found that in the four years ending in 1987, sanctionswere sought in some 700 federal cases and granted in justover half. It's usually the plaintiff lawyer who's fined.   Some critics of Rule 11 say it punishes cases that shouldbe brought. The New York Legislature threatens to suspend itsversion of Rule 11 partly because of fears that worthyarguments will be stifled. Last week, the New York State Barissued a report that proposes making the test &quot;abusiveconduct&quot; by lawyers instead of &quot;frivolous conduct.&quot;   It's a little hard to get worked up over the prospect ofchilling imaginative lawsuits. After all, it was legalcreativity stamped with approval by activist judges that gotus into this mess in the first place. For example, 30 yearsago it would have been frivolous and/or abusive to argue thata defendant should be liable regardless of fault simplybecause it's a big corporation. This &quot;enterprise liability&quot;is now the law in many jurisdictions.   The better argument against Rule 11 is that the barn dooris already closed. Who can know what case is frivolous? Thebreakdown in American law makes it hard to say which legalargument deserves to be punished -- and which some day willbe declared a winner by some judge somewhere. Remember the$10 billion judgment against Texaco by Pennzoil?   One sign that Rule 11 won't solve the problem is thatplaintiffs and defendants now often preemptively -- andfrivolously -- sue each other under Rule 11. There's analternative. Other common-law countries don't have frivolouscases because they have the English rule on costs: Loserpays. Litigants in non-criminal cases avoid high-riskarguments for fear of having to pay the winner's legal costs.Maybe critics of Rule 11 should join the bandwagon in theU.S. to switch to the English rule.</TEXT></DOC>
