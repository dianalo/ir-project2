Mr. Schlesingerwas one of the dissenters from the report. This is excerptedfrom his dissent.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   It is unquestionably necessary to diversify the syllabusin order to meet the needs of a more diversified society. Itis unquestionably necessary to provide for global educationin an increasingly interdependent world. Our students shouldby all means be better acquainted with women's history, withthe history of ethnic and racial minorities, with LatinAmerican, Asian and African history. Debate, alternativeinterpretations, &quot;multiple perspectives&quot; are all essential tothe educational enterprise. I welcome changes that wouldadapt the curriculum to these purposes. If that is what thereport means by multicultural education, I am all for it.   But I fear that the report implies much more than this.The underlying philosophy of the report, as I read it, isthat ethnicity is the defining experience for most Americans,that ethnic ties are permanent and indelible, that thedivision into ethnic groups establishes the basic structureof American society and that a main objective of publiceducation should be the protection, strengthening,celebration and perpetuation of ethnic origins andidentities. Implicit in the report is the classification ofall Americans according to ethnic and racial criteria.   These propositions are assumed rather than argued in thereport. They constitute an ethnic interpretation of Americanhistory that, like the economic interpretation, is valid upto a point but misleading and wrong when presented as thewhole picture.   The ethnic interpretation, moreover, reverses the historictheory of America which has been, not the preservation andsanctification of old cultures and identities, but thecreation of a new national culture and a new nationalidentity. As Secretary of State John Quincy Adams told aGerman contemplating migration to these shores, those whowould settle in America must recognize one necessity: &quot;Theymust cast off the European skin, never to resume it. Theymust look forward to their posterity rather than backward totheir ancestors.&quot;   Of course students should learn more about the richvariety of peoples and cultures that have forged this newAmerican identity. They also should understand the curse ofracism -- the great failure of the American experiment, theglaring contradiction of American ideals and the stillcrippling disease of American society. But we should also bealert to the danger of a society divided into distinct andimmutable ethnic and racial groups, each taught to cherishits own apartness from the rest.   The republic has survived and grown because it hasmaintained a balance between &quot;pluribus&quot; and &quot;unum.&quot; Thereport, it seems to me, is saturated with &quot;pluribus&quot; andneglectful of &quot;unum.&quot;   The first paragraph of the preamble notes that &quot;no othercountry in the world is peopled by a greater variety ofraces, nationalities, and ethnic groups.&quot; It continues: &quot;Butalthough the United States has been a great asylum fordiverse peoples, it has not always been a great refuge fordiverse cultures.&quot; Both points are correct -- but the reportis oblivious to the historical fact that the second sentenceexplains the first.   Why has the U.S. been exempt from the &quot;trends towardseparation and dissolution&quot; that, as the report later notes,are having such destructive effects in the Soviet Union,Canada and elsewhere? Obviously the reason the U.S. is stillthe most successful large multi-ethnic nation is because,instead of emphasizing and perpetuating ethnic separatism, ithas assimilated immigrant cultures into a new Americanculture.   Most immigrants came to America precisely in order toescape their pasts. They wanted to participate in the makingof an American culture and an American national identity.Even black Americans, who came as involuntary immigrants andhave suffered -- still suffer -- awful persecution anddiscrimination, have made vital contributions to the Americanculture.   The preamble rejects &quot;previous ideals of assimilation toan Anglo-American model.&quot; Of course America derives itslanguage and its primary political purposes and institutionsfrom Britain. To pretend otherwise is to falsify history. Toteach otherwise is to mislead our students. But the Britishlegacy has been modified, enriched and reconstituted by theabsorption of non-Anglo cultures and traditions as well as bythe distinctive experiences of American life. That is whyAmerica is so very different a nation from Britain.   The report does on occasion refer in general terms to theneed for &quot;unum&quot; as well as for &quot;pluribus.&quot; The preambleobserves, &quot;Special attention will need to be given to thosevalues, characteristics, and traditions which we share incommon.&quot; I do not, however, find this concern much reflectedin the body of the report or in the proposals for syllabusrevision. Part II begins by describing &quot;the search for commoncultural grounds&quot; as &quot;more important than ever.&quot; Thiscomment, if true, should give that search a much higherpriority than it receives in the report. Buried toward theend is a comment on the importance of examining with care&quot;what the elements are that hold together a nation or culturein spite of what are often great differences. This surely isone of the central questions to be considered in any coursein American history.&quot; It surely is, but it receivespractically no attention in the proposals for curricularrevision.   A basic question is involved: Should public education seekto make our young boys and girls contributors to a commonAmerican culture? Or should it strengthen and perpetuateseparate ethnic and racial subcultures? The report places itsemphasis on cultivating and reinforcing ethnic differences.Students, the report says, should be &quot;continually&quot; encouragedto ask themselves what their cultural heritage is, why theyshould be proud of it, &quot;why should I develop an understandingof and respect for my own culture(s), language(s), religion,and national origin(s).&quot; Would it not be more appropriate forstudents to be &quot;continually&quot; encouraged to understand theAmerican culture in which they are growing up and to preparefor an active role in shaping that culture?   Am I wrong in sensing a certain artificiality andinauthenticity in all this? If the ethnic subcultures hadgenuine vitality, they would be sufficiently instilled inchildren by family, church and community. It is surely notthe office of the public school to promote ethnic separatismand heighten ethnic tensions. The bonds of national cohesionin the republic are sufficiently fragile already. Publiceducation should aim to strengthen, not weaken, them.   Our democratic ideals have been imperfectly realized, butthe long labor to achieve them and to move the Americanexperiment from exclusion to participation has been a centraltheme of American history. It should be a central theme ofthe New York social studies curriculum.   And it is important for students to understand where thesedemocratic ideals come from. They come of course from Europe.Indeed, Europe is the unique source of these ideals -- idealsthat today empower people in every continent and to whichtoday most of the world aspires. That is why it is soessential (in my view) to acquaint students with the Westernhistory and tradition that created our democratic ideals --and why it is so wrong to tell students of non-Europeanorigin that Western ideals are not for them.   I regret the note of Europhobia that sometimes emerges invulgar attacks on &quot;Eurocentric&quot; curriculums. CertainlyEurope, like every other culture, has committed its share ofcrimes. But, unlike most cultures, it has also generatedideals that have opposed and exposed those crimes.   The report, however, plays up the crimes and plays downthe ideals. Thus, when it talks about the Europeancolonization of Africa and India, it deplores &quot;theeradication of many varieties of traditional culture andknowledge.&quot; Like infanticide? slavery? polygamy? subjugationof women? suttee? veil-wearing? foot-binding? clitorectomies?Nothing is said about the influence of European ideas ofdemocracy, human rights, self-government, rule of law.   I also am doubtful about the note occasionally sounded inthe report that &quot;students must be taught social criticism&quot;and &quot;see themselves as active makers and changers of cultureand society&quot; and &quot;promote economic fairness and socialjustice&quot; and &quot;bring about change in their communities, thenation, and the world.&quot; I very much hope that, as citizens,students will do all these things, but I do not think it isthe function of the schools to teach students to becomereformers any more than I ever thought it the function of theschools to teach them the beauty of private enterprise andthe sanctity of the status quo. I will be satisfied if we canteach children to read, write and calculate. If studentsunderstand the nature of our Western democratic tradition,they will move into social criticism on their own. But let usnot politicize the curriculum on behalf either of the left orof the right.   I recognize that I am very much in the minority in thesecomments. But I cannot conscientiously go along with mycolleagues. I respect their serious concern and devotedlabor, and I have enjoyed my association with them. I wouldonly beg them to consider what kind of nation we will have ifwe press further down the road to cultural separatism andethnic fragmentation, if we institutionalize theclassification of our citizens by ethnic and racial criteriaand if we abandon our historic commitment to an Americanidentity. What will hold our people together then?   ---   Mr. Schlesinger is Albert Schweitzer professor of thehumanities at the City University of New York and a winner ofPulitzer Prizes in history and biography.</TEXT></DOC>
