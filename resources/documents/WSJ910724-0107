The dumping case, involving polyacetal resin imported byDu Pont Co. of the U.S., Asahi Chemical Co. of Japan and anAmerican unit of Germany's Hoechst AG, has caught theattention of U.S. trade officials, who fear South Korea maybe unfairly using such cases as a way of restrictingcompetition.</LP><TEXT>   Finance Ministry officials, who set the price floor, saidthe relatively mild penalty wasn't intended to dissuade theU.S. from taking the case before a panel of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva. The ministry hadsuggested last year that provisional anti-dumping duties ofbetween 40% and 50% be applied to the three companies, andsome market watchers see the actual penalty as an act ofappeasement.   However, &quot;I suspect we will be taking this to GATTanyway,&quot; said a U.S. trade official in Seoul. U.S. tradeofficials have requested a meeting in Geneva with Koreanofficials to discuss the case, a required step beforebeginning the process of filing a complaint with GATT, whichcould overturn the Korean decision.   Washington fears that the dumping case, if unchallenged,may be used as a precedent to block imports by foreigncompanies that lower their prices to stay competitive. Inaddition, there is concern that foreign companies could facedumping charges any time a Korean company incurs losses whileexpanding to increase its domestic-market share.   The three companies argued that their resin prices inKorea, though lower than in their home markets, were stillhigher than those of many of their competitors. The companythat claimed it was hurt was Korea Engineering Plastics Co.   The resin is used in auto and electrical parts,butane-lighter shells, zippers and other products. Theminimum-price system will be in effect for two years.</TEXT></DOC>
