The claim contradicted earlier pronouncements by Hanoi, whichsaid fighting had died down and it could therefore beginwithdrawing troops.   The clandestine Khmer Rouge radio said 2,821 Vietnamese soldiershad been killed or wounded during the first month of the 10th rainyseason of the war. It said Hanoi's administrative networks had beendismantled in 537 villages, 11 communes and one township.   Past rainy seasons have usually favored the guerrillas, who arefighting the mechanized, conventional forces Vietnam has maintainedin Cambodia since its late 1978 invasion.   ``They lack both fighting forces and food supplies, and theiraggressor soldiers are increasingly demoralized,'' said thebroadcast, made available in Bangkok. ``In sum, the Vietnamese havefailed and are a complete impasse.''   Vietnam, however, has announced that a greatly improved securitysituation in Cambodia would allow it to pull 50,000 troops out ofCambodia over the next seven months. The partial withdrawal maybegin late this month.   Western analysts, who are generally skeptical of Khmer Rougeclaims, say there has been a sharp drop in fighting in Cambodia inrecent months. They speculated that the Khmer Rouge and otherguerrilla groups may be stockpiling weapons and positioningthemselves for a big push when Hanoi's forces are scaled down.   The Khmer Rouge, ousted from power by the Vietnamese, are alliedto two non-communist groups in a loose coalition.</TEXT></DOC>
