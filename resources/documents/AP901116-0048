The United Nations agency inspects Iraqi and other nuclearfacilities at six-month intervals, under the Non-ProliferationTreaty that prohibits the spread of nuclear technology fornon-peaceful use.   Iraq's representative to the IAEA, Rahim Al-Kital, told theagency's director-general, Hans Blix, three weeks ago that ``thedoors were open'' for a routine inspection at the country's fournuclear research sites, spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer said.   The last inspection was in April. Speculation had arisen thatBaghdad might prohibit visits after the agency suspended technicalassistance in line with U.N. sanctions following Iraq's invasion ofKuwait Aug. 2.   With the suspension still in effect, Meyer declined to say in atelephone interview whether agency inspectors would tour Iraq's tworesearch reactors, storage and fuel producing facilities.   Al Kital could not be reached for comment.   The last inspection found no evidence Iraq was putting uraniumat its nuclear facilities to military use, an agency statementsaid.   Iraq has repeatedly denied allegations by Western media andIsrael, which bombed Iraq's Tammuz-1 reactor in 1981, that it isdeveloping nuclear weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
