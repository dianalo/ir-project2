Rosholt, Deputy EthicsCounselor, at (202) 898-7271.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On July 12, 1988, the FDIC issued forpublic comment a proposed revision to Part 336 of its rules and regulations,12 CFR Part 336, which part governs standards of ethical and other conductof FDIC employees (53 FR 26262). Further, comment was directly solicitedfrom the union representing FDIC employees, and each employee was maileda copy of the proposed rule. In addition, the Office of Government Ethics(``OGE'') and the Department of Justice reviewed the regulation for consistencywith applicable law and regulation.In addition to written comments from the OGE, four written comments werereceived, all from FDIC employees. One comment stressed the importanceof the proposed revisions regarding extensions of credit to examiners andthe elimination of the Confidential Report of Indebtedness as a separate,semiannual filing for most employees. Another commenter, suggesting thatthe proposed regulation was inequitable to employees, requested that examinersbe allowed to obtain credit cards from state nonmember banks located withintheir region of assignment and then be disqualified from working on mattersaffecting such banks. One commenter suggested that the proposed regulationbe revised to call employees' attention to prohibitions against sexualharassment. Another proposed that a Division of Liquidation employee notbe disqualified from matters pertaining to his or her creditor if the extensionof credit had become prohibited as a result of the original creditor institution'sfailure or receipt of financial assistance from the FDIC.After considering all comments, the Board of Directors has determined toadopt the regulation substantially in the form proposed, with the followingchanges:1. The definition of ``appear personally'' has been deleted because theterm is not used in the text of the regulation. Instead, at the recommendationof the OGE, a new definition of ``appearance'' has been added, which tracksthe language of the OGE's model regulation at 5 CFR 737.5(b)(3).2. The proposed provision specifically allowing an employee's acceptanceof commemorative items of nominal value has been deleted due to the OGE'srequirements. Employees may only accept unsolicited advertising or promotionalmaterial of nominal value pursuant to andSection;336.8(b)(2).3. As the OGE required, and in conformance with its advisory opinions,the prohibition on receiving compensation for a speech in andSection;336.11(c)has been changed to pertain only to a speech, the subject matter of whichrelates <T3/><T3>specifically</T3> to matters involving the FDIC.4. The addition of a prohibition against sexual harassment is beyond thescope of this regulation. The prohibition against gambling on FDIC property(andSection;336.14(b)) has been broadened to cover all government property,as was required by the OGE.5. Division of Liquidation employees will not be able to borrow from whollyowned subsidiaries of the bank resulting from a failed bank within theemployee's region. The language changes in andSection;336.16(b)(3) have beenmade to cover loan production offices opened by banks that are not bankbranches and to clarify that an assuming entity and its branches located<T3>outside</T3> of an employee's region are not prohibited creditors.In addition, the disqualification for an employee to act on matters pertainingto his or her creditor institution under andSection;336.16(d) is retainedto ensure that employees avoid conflicts of interest and the appearancethereof.6. Division of Bank Supervision employees referenced in andSection;336.16(a)will not be permitted to obtain credit cards from state nonmember bankslocated in their region. Although one commenter suggested that the affectedemployees could be disqualified from working on matters affecting suchinstitutions, such a procedure would have a potentially severe impact onthe FDIC's ability to examine banks. By curtailing the number of availablestaff in a region, possibly to very few, implementing the procedure couldimpede the Division of Bank Supervision's accomplishment of its mission.7. In accordance with requirements of the OGE, the language of andSection;336.26has been changed to require covered employees to report their resignationand prospective employment as soon as possible but in no event less thantwo weeks before resignation. As the OGE commented, ``If prospective employmentis reported as soon as possible, any necessary recusals can be more promptlyimplemented.''8. In accordance with requirements from the OGE, the provisions of andSection;336.29(a-e)on post-employment activities have been revised to track the language ofthe model regulation at 5 CFR 737.5(a), 737.7(a), 737.5(c), 737.9(a), and737.11(a), which sections are now cross-referenced. The new language clarifiesthat the prohibition extends to representation before any U.S. or Districtof Columbia agency or court (rather than merely representation before theFDIC), as title 18 of the U.S. Code requires.9. Other grammatical and clarification changes were made to the regulation.Two examples are: (a) The FDIC's Office of Research and Strategic Planningwill soon be renamed the Office of Research and Statistics, which is reflectedin the final rule, and (b) the shorthand summary of credit prohibitionsin the Appendix now includes the fact that the exception for the assumptionof a mortgage is for an employee's personal residence only.Employees are encouraged to consult at any time with the Ethics Counselor,Ethics Program Manager, or Deputy Ethics Counselors regarding any questionsthey may have on this part.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act Statement</ITAG>Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) the FDIC's Board of Directors hereby certifies that thefinal rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. The FDIC's Board of Directors bases its conclusionon the fact that the rule applies to all programs and activities conductedby the FDIC but does not reach the activities of the banks regulated and/orinsured by the FDIC. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement</ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) is inapplicable to the final rule as it applies onlyto U.S. government employees in the course of their normal employment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 336 </ITAG>Conflicts of interest, Credit, Disclosure requirements, Former governmentemployees, Government employees.
