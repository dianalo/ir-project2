The ancient city of Baalbek announces itself with a bannerproclaiming &quot;Relations With Israel Are Forbidden.&quot; The town'smost conspicuous financial institution is Bank Sadirat Iran;its best hospital is managed by Iranian Revolutionary Guards.</LP><TEXT>   This is the heartland of radical Islam: home to Hezbollah-- the Party of God -- and most of its secretive sistergroups. Beyond the valley's freshly harvested fields lie theguerrilla training camps that for almost a decade sent fortha supply of &quot;martyrs&quot; to blow up U.S. Marines and diplomats,to shoot American University professors or drag Westernersinto captivity.   But now, groups such as Hezbollah are beginning to showthe world a different face. As Western hostages one by oneregain their freedom and Lebanon slowly stabilizes, Hezbollahis beginning to look as if it wants to play politics as wellas wage holy war. Yesterday, the Anglican envoy Terry Waiteand the American academic Thomas Sutherland were freed bytheir captors in Beirut and handed over to Syrian officials.At a press conference, Mr. Waite said he expects the threeremaining U.S. hostages, Joseph Cicippio, Alann Steen andTerry Anderson, to be released by the end of the month. Hesaid one of his abductors told him: &quot;We recognize now thiswas a wrong thing to do, that holding hostages achieves nouseful, constructive purpose.&quot;   The main reasons for these changes lie outside Lebanon, inSyria and Iran. Anxious for Western investment and regionalinfluence with the pro-American Gulf states, neither Syrianor Iran wants to be accused of pulling the strings of thegroups whose bloody spectacles they backed in the past. InOctober, Iran told the Lebanese government that it wouldwithdraw its Revolutionary Guards, some 1,500 of whom havebeen in Lebanon since 1982. These retrenchments leaveHezbollah reduced to a local Lebanese organization, relyingon the support of its domestic constituency and whateverbridges it can build to the wider Lebanese community.   Even in Baalbek, small signs of a new, conciliatory spiritare apparent. At the venerable Palmyra hotel, it's possibleonce again to discreetly drink a beer, despite the officialIslamic prohibition on alcohol. Behind closed doors, twoBaalbek doctors settle back to enjoy the hot new video intown, &quot;Delta Force IV,&quot; in which American commandos splatteran Islamic gang that plans to nuke Florida. A year ago,possessing such a video would have been an unthinkable risk.All summer, scantily clad teen-age day-trippers from Beirutcavorted among the city's Roman ruins, with only the gentlestsuggestions about Islamic dress from the activists ofHezbollah.   &quot;We know that Islam says be modest, but those who don'twish to observe this are free to do as they like,&quot; says UmmZahra, the soft-spoken principal of Hezbollah's religiousacademy for women.   In the southern slums of Beirut, a Hezbollah gunman guardsthe apartment of Subhi Tofeileh, a Lebanese cleric near thetop of Hezbollah's shadowy hierarchy. He has a Soviet assaultrifle over his shoulder and &quot;U.S.A.&quot; embroidered on hisjeans. Inside, the sheik speaks slowly and deliberately aboutwhat the U.S. now can expect from his organization.Americans, he says, flicking black worry beads through palefingers, are free to return to Lebanon, so long as they don'tcome back in the role of warriors taking sides with thecountry's Christian militias or Israeli occupiers.   As for the remaining Western hostages: &quot;They werebeneficial in the past and now are not.&quot; In the days ofIran's war with Iraq, he explains, the hostages &quot;were a kindof `you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours'&quot; asset toIran; they were useful both as a bargaining chip for weaponsand as a way to offset the U.S. tilt toward Iraq.   Hezbollah's main target now is Israel, the sheik says. Hewarns that even if all the other Arabs agree to make peace,&quot;it will be our duty to cancel their work.&quot; Hezbollah attackson Israeli troops have more than doubled from a year ago, andIsrael has responded with shelling and air raids. An Israelimilitary source says neither Syria nor Iran has total controlover the Hezbollah fighters. Alone among Lebanon's militias,Hezbollah hasn't surrendered its weapons to the Lebanesearmy, claiming it needs them until it forces Israel to leavesouthern Lebanon. Israel's reply, broadcast from its Voice ofthe South radio station: &quot;After you.&quot;   But Sheik Tofeileh says America needn't be included inthis fight despite its sponsorship of the Middle East peaceprocess. &quot;American investments, or American embassies orcivilians&quot; won't be Hezbollah targets, he says.   To be sure, Hezbollah has always disavowed involvement inthe bloodiest acts of sister groups such as Islamic Jihad,though it has never proved that such groups are separate inanything but name. It isn't known which, if any, of thesegroups was behind the bombing earlier this month of theAmerican University of Beirut. Nevertheless, just a fewblocks from Mr. Tofeileh's apartment, one American investmentis taking the sheik's assurances seriously. A month ago, theAmerican Language Center opened for business. Its U.S.-flaglogos are plastered on the crumbling walls of theneighborhood's slums, alongside ads for Iranian films,Khomeini portraits and the dozens of pictures of beardedyouths venerated for martyrdom in operations against theenemies of Islam.   Six months ago, even displaying the names of businesses inEnglish lettering was frowned upon. Now, Mirna Hammadi, inblue jeans and ponytail, explains to a would-be student in ablack chador that if she signs up for English classes, herfinal test will be graded at the University of Michigan,which has agreed to issue certificates of proficiency for thecenter. &quot;All our classes are already full -- we have to openanother one,&quot; says Ms. Hammadi, whose father soughtHezbollah's approval before opening the center. Hezbollahdiscussed the matter for three weeks, then came back with ayes. To help the decision, the center offered a half-dozenscholarships to Hezbollah-nominated students.   In large part, Hezbollah has prospered by dispensing justsuch patronage.   Hezbollah, which takes its name from a Koranic verse thatpromises victory to those who join &quot;the Party of God,&quot; grewup among Lebanon's worst rural squalor and urban slums. ItsShiite members come from the country's most numerous sect butits least powerful and most deprived.   In Beirut's southern suburbs, war damage and povertycreate squalid vistas of crumbling masonry and rotting trash.Even by this city's harsh standard, it is a bleak and brokenplace. Amid these ruins, almost everything that makes lifebearable is supplied by Hezbollah. There is clean water intanks emblazoned with the Iranian flag and spotless hospitalswhere doctors work on Iranian-subsidized salaries. Patientspay just $4 to see a specialist, instead of $15 at a privateclinic.   In neighborhoods where most schools prepare their studentsfor little more than life in militias, Hezbollah's brightclassrooms are staffed by teachers with master's degrees. Itssupermarket charges low prices. Its volunteers rebuild thehomes of the indigent. There are even Hezbollah-run classesin flower arranging.   &quot;I'm not with them, I don't like their ideas, but they arethe only ones who have worked so well for the people here,&quot;says Muna Yassin, a social worker who grew up in the southernsuburbs. &quot;They plan, they're efficient -- I don't thinkthey've started a center that hasn't worked.&quot;   The group certainly is better known for its fighters thanits fashions, but in the basement of the Great Prophetmosque, a matronly 44-year-old manager shows off a Hezbollahgarment factory that provides jobs for unemployed women, cashfor the families of &quot;martyrs&quot; and modest clothes that followIslamic precepts. &quot;My Islam isn't a bunch of fighters. It's arevolution of culture, of ideas,&quot; says the manager, HajjiaZahra, leafing through a German fashion catalog to pick upnew looks for pockets, zippers and sleeves. The businessemploys 45 workers and exports dresses. It is about toexpand.   In its retail store, a student in leggings and a tight,un-Islamic T-shirt inscribed &quot;Hollywood Cat&quot; is inquiringabout a college graduation gown. &quot;I like to know that theprofit is going to charity rather than into one man'spocket,&quot; says the graduate, Ramzia Kreidieh. &quot;And the salespeople here are more helpful.&quot;   But not all Lebanese have learned to feel comfortablearound Hezbollah. Many Christians can't forget the mid-1980s,when Hezbollah youths charged into bars, smashed bottles andforced patrons at gunpoint to pour their drinks on theirheads.   A taxi driver of the Druse sect declines to take areporter to the Great Prophet mosque. &quot;They will kill you,&quot;he warns. &quot;And then they'll kill me.&quot; Another driver worriesabout the bristle of antennas sprouting from the mosque'sminaret and pointing in the direction of Iran. &quot;Why do theyneed that?&quot; he muses. Hezbollah officials say they are merelyboosting the broadcasting signal of Islamic television.   Hezbollah activists prove courteous, if cautious, ingreeting a rare Western visitor. Most recognize that thegroup's image still is dominated by the hostage issue, andthat most outsiders don't accept the claim that Hezbollahdoesn't control sister groups like Islamic Jihad, whichactually hold the captives. Almost all now say they want thehostages freed.   To Mona Hamdan Obeid, particularly, the issue is urgent.At 2 a.m. one night in 1989, Israeli commandos crept into herbedroom and snatched her husband, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid,the Hezbollah leader in the southern village of Jibchit. Thesheik is famous for preaching against the Israeli occupationof Lebanon and encouraging guerrilla actions against Israelitroops. Israelis say her husband will be the last card playedin the hostage drama: the final captive to be traded.   Outwardly, Jibchit is a peaceful place, with fig trees andolive groves clinging to its scant soil. But for almost adecade, this village has been a center of Islamic resistanceand bitter Israeli reprisals. Israel occupies what it terms a&quot;security zone&quot; about three miles from here, and some 8,000Hezbollah guerrillas are based nearby, fighting the Israelipresence.   Returning from the hospital with her ailing nine-year-oldson, the chador-clad Mrs. Obeid wearily climbs the steps toher apartment. Sinking down onto a mat, she wipes the sweatfrom her face and concedes that she feels sympathy for thefamilies of Western hostages. &quot;I'm completely against holdingany innocent people, because I am suffering and I don't wantanyone else to suffer like me,&quot; says the dark-eyed, dimpled26-year-old.   But she doesn't count Israelis as innocent, and rejectsthe notion that prisoners of war such as the Israeli airmanRon Arad should be included in the hostage deal. &quot;They foughtus inside our own country,&quot; she says. &quot;How can you comparethat with my husband, who is nothing but a religious man?&quot;   In her next breath, however, she articulates thephilosophy that the Israelis used to pinpoint her husband asa dangerous enemy, and which could continue to makeHezbollah, even without its outside patrons, a thorn in theside of America.   &quot;Israel,&quot; she says, &quot;is like a cancer in our world, and wemust cut it out.&quot; She waves a hand toward her tiny sons,roughhousing on the carpet. &quot;Being martyred is the mostbeautiful gift anyone can get from God,&quot; she says softly.&quot;Each family must give one or two of its sons to fight theenemies of Islam.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
