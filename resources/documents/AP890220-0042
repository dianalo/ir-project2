Also today, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens left for Cairo formeetings with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, andEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Arens will reportedly push for theresumption of ties, severed by Moscow after the 1967 Middle Eastwar, and Israeli media quoted officials in Jerusalem as saying therewere indications relations might resume this year.   The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, a group made upmostly of Palestine Liberation Organization factions, called for athree-day general strike. It was the longest strike since thePalestinian uprising began Dec. 8, 1987.   In a counter move, the army declared Nablus, the occupied WestBank's largest city, a closed military area, and erected roadblocksat the four entrances to stop motorists from entering.   Inside Nablus, troops stopped dozens of Arab-owned cars,confiscated the drivers' identity cards and ordered them to removeoutlawed Palestinian flags and PLO wall graffiti, an Arab reportersaid. Palestinians are subject to immediate arrest unless they carryIsraeli-issued identity cards.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded twoPalestinians during clashes in the Deir El Balah refugee camp, Arabdoctors said.   In the West Bank city of Jenin, troops bulldozed the house of aresident accused of throwing three firebombs at an Israeli armyvehicle, an army official said. The official did not know if anyonewas injured in the firebomb attack.   The army also sealed three homes of suspected firebomb throwers,one in the West Bank village of Hawwara and two in the village ofDahiat al Barrad near Jerusalem, the official said.   The United States has criticized house demolitions and sealings,saying they violate the right to due process. Houses are usuallydemolished or sealed before a suspect is charged.   In another development, Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini,considered a top PLO supporter in the occupied lands, made aconciliatory gesture to Israel, saying a Palestinian state would notneed an army.   ``What do armies do in this part of the world?'' the JerusalemPost quoted him as saying during a speech in Tel Aviv. ``Either theytake over the country in coups or they end up in the Knesset(Israeli parliament) in other ways.''   The PLO has argued a Palestinian state should have all attributesof statehood, including an army. The Israeli government objects tothe formation of a Palestinian state, saying it would endanger thesecurity of the Jewish state.   Husseini was released from Israeli detention last month afterspending 18 of the past 22 months in prison without a trial. Sincehis release, he has met with several left-wing and liberal Israelilegislators.</TEXT></DOC>
