(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wildcat coal strikes around the nationthat have left some tempers flaring cooled over the weekend, andpolice are hoping they stay that way.   ``Everybody's pretty tired,'' said state police Sgt. C.R.Smithers of the Beckley detachment, based in the heart of coalcountry. ``We've all been working pretty hard to keep up with this.''   The strikes, which enter their third week Monday, began in WestVirginia on June 12 as union miners walked off the job to expresssympathy with other United Mine Workers members striking PittstonCoal Group Inc. As of Sunday, about 43,000 miners in nine statesremained off the job.   In addition to West Virginia, wildcat strikes are being staged inIllinois, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Virginiaand Tennessee.   About 350 strikers in Missouri announced they would return towork Monday.   On Sunday, officials at Citizens Gas and Coke Utility inIndianapolis said they will respond to the strike by cutting cokeproduction by about one third, beginning Monday.   Spokesman Steve Scott said Indianapolis-area foundaries will beaffected, but said the cutbacks will not affect the company's220,000 residential gas customers.   Scott said the cutbacks will extend the utility's reserves fromone month to about 50 days. Citizens Gas' primary coal supply comesfrom West Virginia; other Indiana utlities have reported adequatecoal reserves.   The UMW has offered no explanation for the wildcat walkouts,which coal producers say violate the union's national contract, andit doesn't officially recognize them. But miners who walked off thejob in Appalachia and the Midwest say they're striking in sympathywith the Pittston strikers.   That strike, which began April 5 in Virginia and West Virginiaand spread to Kentucky on June 19, has idled 1,900 workers. The UMWstruck Pittston when contract negotiations stalled over wage andbenefit disputes; the miners had worked for 14 months without acontract.   Several coal companies have gone to court in at least threestates in an effort to force the miners back to work. Lester Weist,spokesman for UMW Local 5179 in Oakland City, Ind., said Sundaythose legal efforts could end up prolonging the strike in Indiana,where all 1,750 union miners have been out since June 16.   ``If there is anything they can do to strengthen the resolve ofthe strikers, that's it,'' Weist said.   Another UMW official in Indiana, however, said he hopes theminers will be back on the job later this week.   ``We've encouraged them to return to work daily, so we'll justhave to wait and see,'' said Roger Myers, an executive board memberfor UMW District 11.   Scattered incidents of violence have been reported during thestrikes. In Alabama and West Virginia, shootings were reported lastweek, with a West Virginia teen-ager grazed by a bullet. However,police reported relative calm throughout the coal fields thisweekend.   Smithers said authorities have been trying to prevent incidentssuch as the one in which Jamie Blankenship, 19, suffered a minorhead wound Thursday at a non-union mine in the southern WestVirginia coal fields. Authorities say they don't know who fired theshot.   But the trooper said it's hard to prevent such violence in aregion where strikes often have turned bloody.   ``It can certainly get a lot worse,'' Smithers said.   The end of the walkouts apparently hinges on the outcome of theUMW's negotiations with Pittston, and the company and the unioncurrently aren't at the bargaining table.   Federal mediators were called in earlier, but the union droppedout of those negotiations June 7, and Pittston later declared animpasse and implemented its own contract.   UMW President Richard Trumka this weekend blasted Pittston forthe failure in negotiations.   ``The Pittston Coal Co., over a 17-month period, has beenabsolutely intransigent,'' he said. ``They've rebuffed every offer.''   Company officials have called the union's demands unrealistic.</TEXT></DOC>
