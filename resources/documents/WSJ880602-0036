It eliminated many loopholes and special breaks in hopes of making companies pay more uniformly, and in exchange it cut the corporate rate.    Politically, the idea was a masterstroke. Practically, it's coming up somewhat short of the mark.    Not that the law's a flop. Business clearly is paying more. But lawmakers apparently underestimated the extent of the American corporation's desire -- and finely honed ability -- to avoid taxes.    &quot;No matter how many loopholes Congress has tried to close, companies will continue to find ways to pay low tax rates,&quot; says Anthony Tinker, an accounting professor at City University of New York's Baruch College. &quot;It's the easiest game in town.&quot;    It's also a game that's helping hold corporate tax collections stubbornly below original and even revised projections. The take is up. But last fiscal year -- in a slow economy -- it missed original Treasury goals by about $21 billion. This year the economy is better and so are payments, but they may still be $9 billion to $11 billion short of initial targets. So far, You-Know-Who has more than covered the shortfall because of unexpectedly strong personal incomes. But that won't last forever.    And in view of the gaping Federal deficit, every corporate tax dollar that fails to materialize only adds to already strong pressure for higher rates or new taxes on both businesses and individuals not too far down the road.    A study commissioned by this newspaper of the 1987 financial statements of 60 major companies shows what is happening. On one hand, some legendary corporate low-payers and non-payers were corralled. General Electric Co., which paid at an average 2.4% rate from 1982 through 1985, paid at a 28.5% rate last year. General Dynamics Corp., which didn't pay any taxes from 1982 through 1985, paid $270 million in federal income taxes last year.    But the federal tax rate of 26 of the 60 companies actually dropped from the year before. And 51 of them paid at rates lower than the new 40% statutory corporate rate, the study shows. Though variations from the statutory rate always exist, a number managed rates way under it; a few paid microscopic rates: Transamerica Corp. paid 7%; International Business Machines Corp., 1.3%; and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., 0.1%, the study concludes.    Corporate tax returns are private, so exact payments to the government aren't known. Rates in this article were computed by accounting experts using publicly available data. They differ from tax provisions in shareholder reports, which include current and deferred taxes.    The study indicates corporations fended off the tax man last year with skillful timing and application of a variety of allowable credits: by carrying forward losses from previous years, by using remaining benefits of the phased-out investment tax credit and by applying foreign tax credits on repatriated overseas earnings. Stock and bond losses cut taxes for some; others sold assets and used the 34% capital-gains rate to reduce total rates. Big banks generally paid at low rates because foreign loan-loss reserves and overseas branch losses hurt U.S. results.    Some of these devices will gradually disappear, but many won't. Some benefits from the old 10% investment tax credit may live on for a while. Equipment contracted for prior to March 1, 1986, and put into service before Jan. 1, 1991, retains the credit, which can be spread three years back or 15 years forward.    A number of companies say the bulk of their accumulated benefits from past losses will expire in the early 1990s. But new ones, of course, would be generated by new losses. The 1986 law retains the old carry-back and carry-forward rules, so companies can use tax benefits generated by losses as they see fit to reduce their tax bills, going back three years and forward 15 years.    Companies queried for this story declined to say whether they were eligible to pay the alternative minimum tax last year; because their returns are confidential, there isn't any way of knowing. The minimum tax comes into play if it is higher than the standard tax bite.    Tax experts say, however, that in some cases the alternative minimum tax can, in effect, be reduced from its statutory rate of 20% to as little as 1% by offsetting it with previous tax-loss carry-forwards and carry-backs. Other tactics to duck it or lessen its bite are evolving, they say. They can include carefully selected mergers, controlling the timing of income reported on shareholder statements, the use of leased equipment and increasing deferred compensation for executives.    Such continued tax avoidance seems to be a factor keeping overall business-tax collections below their advance billing, though there is some debate about degree. For the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30, the U.S. collected $84 billion in business income taxes, up from $63 billion the year before. But it had initially hoped for $105 billion. Luckily for Uncle Sam, individuals paid $29 billion more than expected, partly because of a one-time surge in capital gains taxes.    Treasury officials maintain the gap reflects an economy that grew more slowly than expected -- which produced lower-than-expected taxable profits -- rather than corporate tax-avoidance skills. Though they acknowledge that corporations still have plenty of ways to reduce their burden, they say they anticipated most of them.    But some tax experts argue that the economy alone doesn't determine corporate profits and tax bills for a given year. Corporations themselves have a lot to say about what profits -- and thus what taxes -- they will realize and when, regardless of how their businesses are going.    &quot;Multinational companies have a high degree of flexibility in the timing and amount of their tax payments,&quot; says Lee Seidler, a Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. senior managing director and writer of a well-known monthly tax newsletter. And, he says, &quot;Every time Congress changes the law, it creates new, unintentional loopholes.&quot;    This budget year, ending Sept. 30, includes a full 12 months of the new tax law. The economy is stronger. And corporate tax collections are improving. Still, they aren't meeting rosy initial forecasts. The Treasury at first predicted it would collect $106 billion from business this budget year. The Congressional Budget Office last January scaled that down to $99 billion and now projects $95 billion to $97 billion.    At a time when the federal budget deficit looms so large, all of this has some key legislators furious. &quot;The low federal tax rates that some corporations are still paying are a disgrace,&quot; says Rep. Fortney H. (Pete) Stark, a California Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, which drafts tax legislation. &quot;We wouldn't hesitate to introduce new legislation to correct these inequities,&quot; he says.    Some in Congress are already thinking about an increase in the alternative minimum tax for corporations and for individuals. &quot;Don't rule out new excise taxes, value-added taxes and higher income taxes next year&quot; either, warns a staff member for a key congressional tax committee.    The new tax law cut the old 46% corporate tax rate to 40% of taxable income for 1987 and to 34% from 1988 on. At the same time, the law tried to eliminate a lot of deductions that critics called &quot;loopholes.&quot;    Among other things, it phases out by 1989 the 10% investment tax credit on new equipment and other production assets, and it stretches depreciation deductions over more years. It makes defense contractors pay taxes on revenues not yet received, and it cuts tax breaks on certain insurance-company and bank reserves.    Predictably, companies dislike any suggestion that they aren't pulling their weight, and argue that broad economic benefits flow from what they save on their tax bills. After all, they don't squander that cash, they say. They often use it to finance growth and expansion, which eventually creates more jobs -- and more tax dollars. Thus, they argue, raising taxes to compensate for their money-saving skills would just hobble the economy.    &quot;Even though we paid federal income taxes at only a 7% rate last year, we believe that business pays more than its fair share,&quot; says James Peirano, Transamerica's vice president for taxes. &quot;If companies cannot take advantage of losses and credits, then the government will squeeze them out of business and cause many more bankruptcies.&quot;    Actually, the $20 million the San Francisco financial-services firm paid in federal taxes last year is more than usual. From 1982 through 1985 it didn't pay any, accumulating about $73 million in credits.    To hold down its bill last year, Transamerica used tax-loss carry-forwards generated in 1986 by its property and casualty insurance company. It took some remaining investment tax credits on airplanes, automobiles and shipping containers purchased in the past by its airline and car-rental units. And it got a credit for foreign taxes it paid that were at a higher rate than the 40% U.S. tax rate.    IBM's 1.3% federal tax rate last year translated into payments of only about $37 million. But some might excuse the giant computer maker. It had been far and away the nation's biggest taxpayer from 1982 through 1985, forking over a total of almost $5 billion.    John Akers, its chairman, recently told the annual meeting that the company benefited in 1987 from the lower statutory rate, plus investment tax credits from prior years and foreign tax credits. Michael Van Vranken, an assistant controller, indicates that the last were significant: &quot;We pay income taxes at the 50% rate in Australia, more than a 50% rate in West Germany and the United Kingdom, and 60% in Japan,&quot; he explains.    Merrill Lynch's tax rate was a meager 0.1% and its bill under a half-million dollars because of huge bond-trading losses early in the year, stock-trading losses during the market crash and the lower capital-gains tax rate on profits it made by selling real estate and leasing interests. A year earlier, it paid about $185 million, a rate of almost 24%.    There's some sensitivity about such comparisons. &quot;The government should look at its entire corporate tax picture, not single out companies that paid very low tax rates last year,&quot; maintains a Merrill Lynch tax specialist. &quot;Each company has a unique tax situation that may help it pay less taxes.&quot;    Like most of those with low rates and big savings, Transamerica, IBM and Merrill Lynch all say the money they saved was well spent. Richard J. Olsen, a Transamerica vice president, says that his company's savings helped pay for an expanded property- and casualty-insurance business and the acquisition of a world-wide network of commercial finance offices. Those actions &quot;will help us deliver more financial support services to other businesses and can only help the economy,&quot; he says.    IBM notes that it raised research and development outlays by 4% last year and increased software investment by 15.5%. And Peter T. Leach, a Merrill Lynch vice president, says his company spent $1 billion for new computer systems and expanded foreign office trading capabilities. Without the computers, he says, &quot;there was no way we could have handled the extra trading volume of last Oct. 19,&quot; when the stock market crashed.    That's not to say such spending wouldn't have occurred otherwise. Motives are hard to detect in the tax game, accountants note. And any cash invested in equipment or acquisitions is obviously indistinguishable from any other corporate dollars spent, such as for dividends or executive salaries.    Many companies in 1987 used special accounting credits from previous business losses to cut their federal taxes. Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. paid at only a 4.6% rate because of huge tax-loss carry-forward credits it accumulated from 1983 through 1985 in its property, casualty and liability insurance business.    &quot;We used these credits last year and paid no tax on our non-life insurance profits, which rose because of rate boosts,&quot; notes Quincy Abbot, Cigna's senior vice president for taxes. Mr. Abbot says it was fortunate Cigna had the credits because &quot;our life-insurance and group-health-insurance lines were hard hit by profit declines.&quot;    Mr. Abbot notes Cigna will pay significantly more federal income taxes in 1989 and 1990 as its tax-loss carry-forwards disappear. &quot;The '86 law also forces us to discount our loss reserves by 20% as a deductible expense,&quot; he notes. &quot;The higher taxable income left will catch up with us.&quot;    Other companies were able to duck higher taxes last year by adjusting their profit stream. H. F. Ahmanson andamp; Co., a savings and loan holding company based in Los Angeles, reduced the amount of loans it resold to $2.6 billion from $5.9 billion in 1986. When loans are resold, they trigger tax payments on up-front loan fees that would be deferred if the loans were kept on the books.    By reducing such resales, Ahmanson cut its federal tax rate to 14.6% in 1987 from 29.2% the year before. But Gayle Sweetland, a vice president, says it isn't fair to look at only the federal taxes actually paid last year. &quot;We set up a reserve for deferred taxes that rose to $37 million last year from $17.7 million in 1986,&quot; she says.    Although the reserve is to pay future taxes, it did reduce Ahmanson's profits reported to shareholders last year, she adds. Ahmanson's pre-tax earnings dropped to $268.8 million last year from $465.8 million in 1986.    The tax law hit retailers hard because they have a lot less in depreciation deductions than big industrial companies. Nonetheless, the Cincinnati-based Kroger Co. supermarket chain reduced its tax rate to 24% in 1987 from 27.1% the year before. &quot;We took a lot of special charges in 1987 for downsizing the company,&quot; notes Larry Peck, director of corporate taxes. Kroger permitted more than 6,200 employees to take early retirement, increasing pension and job-settlement costs.    The likelihood of more tax legislation frightens some companies. &quot;We paid a federal tax rate of 36% last year, up from 15% the year before,&quot; observes Alan Lipner, senior vice president for corporate taxes of American Express Co. in New York.    &quot;We couldn't compete abroad with foreign financial-services firms,&quot; many of which already pay lower taxes, he says.    ---           Federal Income Tax Paid by U.S. Companies    Taxes paid in millions of dollars.
