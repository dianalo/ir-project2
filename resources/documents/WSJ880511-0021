The April 6 accident involved a collision between two eastbound Metro-North Commuter Railroad trains. One person was killed -- an engineer on one of the trains. The FRA said that tests on his body disclosed traces of marijuana in the blood and urine.    In addition, the agency said, all four other dispatching and tower personnel tested positive for drugs, including morphine, codeine and marijuana. Other crew members aboard the two trains tested negative, the FRA said.    The disclosure comes as federal regulators and rail unions are clashing over the issue of drug testing. Earlier this week, Transportation Secretary James Burnley proposed random drug testing of railroad workers and was immediately criticized by unions representing railroad workers. </TEXT></DOC>
