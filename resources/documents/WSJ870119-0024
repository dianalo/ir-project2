The dollar's slide and the German mark's rise gathered pace over the Christmas and New Year's period, adding to pressure that triggered last Monday's realignment of currencies in the European Monetary System. But the dollar's difficulties have been building for some time, reducing its appeal for foreigners.    &quot;There's no good news for the dollar at present,&quot; says economist Ian Harwood of Warburg Securities, the brokerage arm of Mercury International Group PLC, a London financial concern. &quot;The deutsche mark is simply too attractive.&quot;    That's because the once-huge gap between higher dollar interest rates and lower mark rates has narrowed sharply, all but eliminating a major reason for the dollar's popularity. This trend, moreover, has coincided with a deterioration of the U.S. financial position in the world.    The mathematics of the switch in sentiment is simple: International investors favor marks because the slightly higher yields they get on dollars are more than offset by inflationary considerations. For example, the annual yield differentials of 1 11/16 percentage points for short-term investments and 1.57 points for bonds compare with a gap of 2.3 percentage points in their inflation rates, which currently are running at 1.3% in the U.S. but at minus-1% in West Germany.    Another way of looking at what's happening is to consider real, inflation-adjusted bond yields. In the U.S., these have shrunk to about 6% from 7 1/2% in the first quarter of 1983. In Germany's case, they have risen to nearly 7% from 3.1% in the first quarter of 1983.    The bearish view of the U.S. has been reinforced by the worsening state of its external finances. It is now probably the world's largest debtor nation and isn't likely to lose the title anytime soon.    Despite undoubted gains in American competitiveness, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently forecast that the U.S. current account -- the tally of the nation's trade in goods, services and certain unilateral transfers -- would probably run annual deficits of $100 billion &quot;for many years to come,&quot; thus adding to its foreign-debt burden.    So far the U.S. has been able to sell this debt world-wide in dollars. But the OECD -- a Paris-based, government-owned think tank of the world's 24 leading industrial nations -- queried how long international investors would be willing to hold and add to this debt. It warned that unless the U.S. current-account position improves, the world faces the twin dangers of protectionism in the U.S. and &quot;the possibility of a free fall of the dollar and an abrupt tightening of monetary policy.&quot;    Considerations such as these aren't designed to make the dollar strong. Still less is the spectacle of a lame-duck president caught in the Iran-Contra scandal and making little headway in reducing the massive U.S. budget deficit.    Faced with this scenario, international investors have had two broad options: invest either in Japan or West Germany, the world's two premier surplus nations.    Japan was an early favorite, with the yen advancing more strongly than the German mark after the five major industrialized nations agreed in September 1985 to lower the dollar. Recently, Germany has become the main target of speculative funds, largely because the Bundesbank has chosen to keep German interest rates relatively high in order to keep inflation down.    In U.S. eyes, Germany is an oddity among democratic nations. It goes to the polls on Jan. 25 with two million unemployed and the prospect of a meager 2.5% economic growth this year. But the Bundesbank and the government in Bonn believe that low or zero inflation is the motor of long-term economic growth.    However, the Reagan administration has its own priorities. It has been pressuring Germany to cut its interest rates to stimulate economic growth and, by implication, create a bigger market for U.S. exports. This explains the war of words over Germany's refusal to cut interest rates for much of last year. The dispute can be expected to continue after the present center-right coalition government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl records its expected election victory next week.    In this highly charged environment, financial markets are acutely sensitive to any statement or even hint from Treasury Secretary James Baker that he wants the dollar to fall more.    On one hand, a lower dollar is virtually his only way of pressuring West Germany to &quot;do more&quot; to stimulate its economy. But because the U.S. is a debtor nation, talking the currency down carries huge risks for the U.S. and the rest of the world. If the dollar does fall suddenly, foreign investors could stop buying U.S. Treasury securities, forcing a rise in interest rates and a world recession.    What lies ahead? Some European economists -- notably Roland Leuschel, the institutional investment adviser of Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert -- think Germany will join the U.S. and Japan in a pact to stabilize currencies at some stage after the election.    It has to be said that there is no evidence for this. Mr. Baker and his Japanese counterpart, Kiichi Miyazawa, reached a currency-stabilization pact last autumn partly because their two countries have a greater mutual dependence than the U.S. and Germany.    Bundesbank officials have been skeptical of the pact. The Bundesbank doesn't think the world should move toward currency &quot;target&quot; zones; moreover, German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said a few days ago that he's skeptical about &quot;political agreements&quot; to support the dollar.    It's probably wrong to expect much from the Bundesbank on interest rates immediately after the election. The German discount rate is only 3 1/2% -- a mere three-quarter percentage point above its postwar low of 2 3/4% in 1959.    Action on the fiscal front looks more hopeful. (And indeed fiscal expansion by Japan may turn out to be the most enduring feature of the Baker-Miyazawa pact of the autumn). Finance Minister Stoltenberg is committed to a plan to lower top tax rates during the life of the next parliament, and he may even decide to advance a $5.45 billion tax cut scheduled for the beginning of 1988.    But West Germany is likely to say that the U.S. carries the main responsibility for solving the problems of the dollar, U.S. foreign indebtedness, the deficits on current account and the budget.    European monetary officials are clearly concerned that 1987 is getting off to a difficult start. In a recent interview, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the main industrial countries are more keenly aware these days of the advantages of currency stability. &quot;There's been a notable shift in the U.S. position on that,&quot; Mr. Lawson said. &quot;On the other hand, what is happening on world markets makes it harder to attain than it ever has been. That is the paradox.&quot;    ---   Friday's Dollar Activity   The dollar rose slightly in light trading Friday, marking its second consecutive advance following a three-session plunge last week. The currency was supported Thursday and Friday by profit-taking speculators, who had sold the currency at higher levels in previous sessions and subsequently bought it back.    Traders said there was also a reluctance to open new positions ahead of the long weekend in the U.S., which reduced volume. Most banks in the U.S. are closed today to observe the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.    In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at 1.8405 marks, up marginally from 1.8358 Thursday. The currency also firmed to 153.20 yen from 153.18.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery rose 40 cents an ounce, to $416.30, in moderate trading estimated at 3.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $422.50 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                       CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
