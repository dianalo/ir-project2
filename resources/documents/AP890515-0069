The court said it will hear the Bush administration's argumentthat a federal appeals court wrongly required that additionalinformation be supplied to employees.   At the same time, the justices turned away arguments bynon-manufacturing employers that labeling and otheremployee-education requirements were imposed improperly on them.   The Reagan administration in 1983 published a final standard for``evaluating and communicating chemical hazards to employees in themanufacturing sector.''   After the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsruled that the standard was applied too narrowly, governmentregulators applied it in 1987 to non-manufacturing employers aswell _ from dry-cleaners to the construction industry.   The standard requires chemical manufacturers and importers tolabel chemical containers and send safety information to allcustomers. Those customers are required to ensure that thecontainer labels remain affixed, to make safety informationaccessible to employees in their work areas.   Employers also are required to prepare a writtenhazard-communications program that, among other things, contains alist of the hazardous chemicals used in the workplace and to trainemployees on the proper use of such chemicals.   Several of the provisions in the 1987 standard were disapprovedby the Office of Management and Budget, which reviewed the standardunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.   But the 3rd Circuit court later ruled that OMB was unauthorizedto disapprove of any provisions in the standard. The appeals courtrestored the 1987 standard to the form in which it was issued.   In two appeals denied review today, the Associated GeneralContractors of America, the Construction Industry TradeAssociation, the National Grain andamp; Feed Association and otheremployers contended that the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration improperly extended the hazard-communicationstandard to non-manufacturers.   In a third appeal, federal regulators argued that the appealscourt wrongly limited OMB's authority to revise the standard. Itwas the only appeal granted review _ making the high court's reviewa narrow one.   Sweeping new standards for worker exposure to nearly 400hazardous materials took effect earlier this year in the firstoverhaul since passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act 17years ago.   The new standards cover about 21 million American workers.   The cases are Associated General Contractors vs. OSHA, 88-1070;National Grain andamp; Feed Association vs. OSHA, 88-1385; and Dole vs.U.S. Steelworkers, 88-1434.</TEXT></DOC>
