Discovery will be the first shuttle launched since January 1986, when the Challenger disaster killed seven astronauts. Since the accident, the space agency has made hundreds of changes in an effort to improve shuttle safety.    The agency had been expected to announce the launch date last Wednesday. But it delayed the decision, to assess the possible effect of Hurricane Gilbert on mission control and training facilities at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.    By late Friday, weather predictions showed that the Johnson center was at little risk from the storm.    Even with the new launch date set, it is impossible to know when the shuttle will get off the ground. NASA, which is being extremely cautious, is following tightened weather and equipment rules that could cause a number of delays on the launch pad. </TEXT></DOC>
