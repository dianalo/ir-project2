It could be.</LP><TEXT>   Compensation specialists say Paul Fireman's startling paycut at Reebok International Ltd. could create a ripple effectin other boardrooms.   Reebok's chairman and chief executive officer has been oneof the most visible beneficiaries of the past decade's boomin corporate largess. His pay has averaged $13.6 million ayear over the past four years. But at the end of July, a newfive-year contract capped Mr. Fireman's annual cash paymentat $2 million-$1 million in salary and a bonus of as much as$1 million, depending on Reebok's profit performance.   Many companies in recent years have been edging towardusing more stock and less cash to compensate top executives,and Mr. Fireman's example could speed that trend along. Whilethe chief executive gets a huge stock-option grant under hisnew contract, Reebok has made it tougher than usual to profiton those options. For Mr. Fireman just to match his earningsunder his previous contract, which paid him a percentage ofcorporate net income, the company's stock price would have togrow at nearly twice the average rate for companies ingeneral, analysts and compensation experts estimate.   &quot;Ten years ago, we saw performance plans in whichperformance could be readily reached,&quot; says anexecutive-compensation specialist at Union Pacific Corp.&quot;Today, companies are willing to pay more to get more.&quot; Mr.Fireman, who with his wife owns 15% of the footwear concern'sstock, declined repeated requests for interviews, and aReebok spokeswoman wouldn't comment.   One reason the highly visible switch by Reebok is expectedto be influential is that compensation negotiations will soonbe starting at companies across the country. &quot;There's a greatdeal of me-tooism in executive compensation,&quot; says GordonWolf, a vice president at consultants Towers Perrin.   Alan Johnson, compensation specialist at recruiters HandyAssociates, agrees. &quot;The pressure is continuing to increase&quot;to tie executives' compensation more closely to corporateperformance, he says, adding: &quot;No one wants to show up on alist of overpaid executives.&quot;   The Reebok situation, to be sure, has some elementspeculiar to it. Reebok's growth has slowed considerably asrival Nike Inc. has overtaken it. And compensation expertssee the shift in Mr. Fireman's package as the normal passageof a small, entrepreneurial venture into the world ofbig-company compensation. While profit-sharing arrangementsare common at smaller ventures, only a few larger ones --like Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner Inc. -- offer them.   &quot;Fireman is moving from a position of uniqueness to onethat is more normal,&quot; says Graef Crystal, a compensationspecialist and adjunct professor of business administrationat the Haas School of Business, University of California atBerkeley. En route, consultants note, Mr. Fireman's pay pactwas modified once before, to cut the share of corporateprofit to which he was entitled.   Still, compensation consultants maintain that Reebok'sprevious pay package presented several problems of a kindthat companies are increasingly under pressure to correct.Among them:   -- Out-of-Proportion Pay: Many feel that a highlycontroversial $550 million bonus -- based on a percentage ofprofit -- to Drexel Burnham Lambert junk-bond specialistMichael Milken marked a psychological turning point for manycompanies. &quot;People looked at what happened with Mike Milken,who had a formula that never was changed, and said we can'tlet that happen here,&quot; says Mr. Johnson of Handy. While Mr.Fireman's case was by no means that extreme, Mr. Johnsoncalls it a &quot;well-intentioned formula being distorted by thegreat success of the company.&quot;   -- Drain on Corporate Cash: Gary M. Jacobson, an analystat Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., estimates that Mr. Fireman's newpay package will save the company about six cents a sharecompared with his previous pact. In today's austere climate,&quot;people are acutely sensitive to the money people make onannual pay,&quot; Mr. Johnson says. By contrast, he adds: &quot;There'snot very much sensitivity to equity. There's no rumbling atall about the billions Bill Gates has made {throughappreciation of the stock he owns} at Microsoft.&quot;   -- Paying for Low Performance: Although most companies saytheir pay plan pays for performance, in practice it oftendoesn't work out that way. Because he shared in corporateprofit above a certain threshold, Mr. Fireman took home hugebonuses even when corporate results soured. Reebok's stockprice has been flat over the past several years, and in 1988,when earnings dropped 17%, Mr. Fireman's bonus dropped, too-- to $11.1 million from $15.1 million.   One novel aspect of Mr. Fireman's new pay package thatcompensation experts see creeping into other plans is the useof so-called premium-priced stock options. Stock options givethe right to purchase a share of stock in the future at aprice fixed today. Normally, that price is the market priceon the date the option is granted. Sometimes, options areeven granted at a discount to market price, giving executivesa potential profit right away.   The 2.5 million options granted under Mr. Fireman's newcontract, however, have exercise prices an average of 18%higher than Reebok's current market price.   Mr. Crystal at Berkeley figures that to match the previousbonus arrangement, Mr. Fireman would have to preside over astock-price appreciation exceeding 24% a year for the 10years the options are exercisable. Since World War II, henotes, the compounded return on stocks in general has beenabout 14%.   Some other companies have also added similar strictprovisions. Under a 10-year contract that expires in 1998,Michael Eisner, chairman of Disney, gets options on twomillion shares, 500,000 of them priced at $10 above themarket price on the date they were granted.   At Union Pacific, an executive-incentive program begins topay off only after the stock price hits $100, nearly doubleits value when the plan was designed. &quot;It's a very ambitiousplan,&quot; says the Union Pacific compensation official. &quot;Welooked for a program that had a high performance hurdle.&quot;   Compensation specialists say they hope others will follow.Giving premium options &quot;sends a powerful signal to theinvestment community&quot; about a company's expectations forgrowth, asserts Louis Brindisi Jr., chairman of StrategicCompensation Associates.   &quot;I'd like to see more of it,&quot; says Mr. Crystal.   Still, many expect a slow, painful process. &quot;We arepassing the castor-oil bottle,&quot; Mr. Crystal adds. &quot;This isnot a nice goodie.&quot; Others note that when companies adoptunusual or risky pay provisions, they are often simplyadditions to existing programs, not replacements. That istrue at Union Pacific, where the company also offerstraditional stock options.</TEXT></DOC>
