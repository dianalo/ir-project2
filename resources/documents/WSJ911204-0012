Dr. Baltimore resigned Monday aspresident of Rockefeller University, the prestigious researchinstitution in New York City.   So, after several years of preoccupation with the Dingellinvestigation of Dr. Baltimore, Rockefeller has no presidentand must search for a replacement. Several prominentresearchers have departed the center, taking their teams withthem. Younger Rockefeller scientists who were eager to workunder Dr. Baltimore are left leaderless. As always withinvestigations conducted by Mr. Dingell, the exterminatingangel of the regulatory authoritarianism movement, thevictory has produced mostly rubble.</LP><TEXT>   Any scientist wondering how it could have dragged on tothis end should consult Suzanne Garment's account of theBaltimore case in her recently published book, &quot;Scandal: TheCulture of Mistrust in American Politics.&quot; She recounts aconversation with a Dingell staffer who is asked, with thefear of God already in the scientific community, why it isnecessary to go on:   &quot;Because Baltimore and the rest covered this up.&quot;   &quot;You mean his humiliation is a necessary part of yourenterprise?&quot;   &quot;Yes.&quot;   The staffer then argues that science is massively corrupt.&quot;In science,&quot; he says, &quot;you have to lie to survive.&quot;   Dr. Baltimore presumably will be free now to defendhimself against a so-called second phase of the Dingellinvestigation. Because congressional committees possesssubpoena power and because Mr. Dingell employs a large staffthat enjoys pushing people around with that power, Dr.Baltimore's prospects of clearing himself must be rated lessthan good. To our knowledge, the only Dingell target ever toemerge whole was Jules Kroll of the huge privateinvestigation firm, Kroll Associates. In other words, youhave little chance of prevailing against the Dingell Minotaurunless you own a private army.   Scientists do not own armies. They primarily have ideasand arguments and an inherent faith in the eventual victoryof facts over falsity. Based on what they read, manyscientists indeed concluded that Dr. Baltimore deservedcensure for his conduct during the highly publicized disputebetween researchers Thereza Imanishi-Kari and Margot O'Toole.It isn't clear, though, that the scientific community willever acquire a reliable set of facts around this case.   The Dingell committee's facts are of course prosecutorial.The only other source of information outside a libel suit isthe Office of Scientific Integrity, an arm of the NationalInstitutes of Health. Though not widely reported beyond thescientific press, OSI has been the subject of a fascinating,critical offensive from scientists, who accuse theDingell-like OSI of abusing its targets' due-process rights.For instance, while Ms. O'Toole was depicted in news reportsas a whistle-blowing hero, less publicity was bestowed on aJune letter to OSI from 143 scientists criticizing the StarChamber nature of the office's investigation.   Science magazine, which has provided the most informativecoverage of the Baltimore case, reports in its current issuethat an NIH advisory panel has just urged OSI to clarify itsmission. When the integrity office published a definition ofscientific misconduct in June, some 2,000 scientists wrotethe government to denounce its vagueness.   For most of the past four decades, American science sawits funding relationship with the federal government as amarriage made in heaven. The Baltimore case and a pattern ofevents the past several years strongly suggest that Americanscientists may be trapped in a Faustian bargain with theiromnipotent government.</TEXT></DOC>
