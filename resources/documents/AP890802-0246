Capital Cities-ABC Inc. owns a controlling 80 percent interestin ESPN, the nation's largest cable network with 52.4 millionsubscribers.   RJR Nabisco, acquired for $24.5 billion in April by a group ledby the buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., saidTuesday it had retained Lazard Freres andamp; Co. to advise it on theESPN stake.   ``We have had several inquiries from parties interested inacquiring our stake in ESPN,'' Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman andchief executive of RJR Nabisco, said in a statement. ``However, wehave not decided whether we will sell our stake. Lazard will helpus evaluate our alternatives.''   RJR Nabisco is looking for ways to raise cash through assetsales in an effort to reduce the huge debt incurred in the buyout.   It has said it intends to sell about $5.5 billion in assets toreduce debt and has announced about $2.6 billion of suchtransactions, mostly the sale of five Nabisco food companies inEurope.   Nabisco Brands Inc., an RJR subsidiary, acquired the ESPN stakefor $60 million in 1984 from ABC Video Enterprises. At the time,Nabisco Brands was beginning to become heavily involved in sportsmarketing.   RJR's new management has indicated it is reviewing the company'smarketing efforts and is likely to reduce its involvement in sportsmarketing.   Some industry analysts questioned whether the ESPN stake wouldhave any significant value to anyone other than Capital Cities,because the giant media concern will control ESPN no matter whoowns the minority stake.   RJR spokesman David Kalish said Capital Cities-ABC has the rightto match any bona fide offer that might be made for the ESPN stakeheld by RJR.   Capital Cities-ABC said it had no comment on RJR's statement.   ESPN was controlled by Getty Oil Co. when it was launched inSeptember 1979. ABC Video acquired a 15 percent stake in ESPN inJanuary 1984 and obtained the remaining 85 percent five monthslater from Texaco Inc. after Texaco's acquisition of Getty.   ESPN's visibility has been rising in recent years. It has beencarrying National Football League telecasts for two years andacquired in January the rights to telecast 175 regular season MajorLeague Baseball games a year for four years starting in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
