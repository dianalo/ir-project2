<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-24-0385 </DOCNO><TEXT>As part of a research effort by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyto study the dispersion of pollutants in aquatic systems, a numericalmodel was developed that is capable of realistically describing the hydrodynamicsin lakes, embayments, nearshore marine coastal areas, and riverine andthermal outfall plumes. The model is time-dependent, three-dimensional,and variable density. Both rigid-lid and free-surface flows can be determined.The main assumptions used in the development of the model include hydrostatic-pressurevariation, Boussinesq approximation, and eddy coefficients to accountfor turbulence. A new solution procedure, which is a modification ofthe simplified marker and cell method, is used. The procedure permitsselected terms in the equations to be treated implicitly in time. Thereport provides the documentation for the computer program for the numericalmodel.</TEXT></DOC>
