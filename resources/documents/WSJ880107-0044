The question is: How much?    On Tuesday, First Boston analyst Peter Butler said Quantum's earnings could double this year to $9.65 a share. Yesterday, PaineWebber raised the ante to $10 to $12 a share for 1988, and $12 to $15 a share for 1989. Their comments have helped send Quantum up 6 1/4 points in the past three trading days. The stock closed yesterday at 78 1/2, up 2 7/8.    Quantum's fancy new name symbolizes the company's exit last year from the liquor business to concentrate on chemicals. The name is supposed to conjure up images of quantum physics and quantum leaps -- &quot;moving rapidly forward in a somewhat high-tech area,&quot; as Chairman John Stookey put it in an interview yesterday.    You mightn't consider plastic shopping bags, see-through meat wrappers or squeezable ketchup bottles as particularly high-tech. Nonetheless, such polyethylene products &quot;require a lot of very esoteric technology,&quot; Mr. Stookey asserted. In addition to polyethylene and other petrochemicals, which represent about 62% of 1987 sales, Quantum also sells propane, 27% of sales, and oleochemicals, made from fats and oils.    Quantum has boosted its share of the U.S. polyethylene market to an expected 22% from 10% a year ago. Now it is reaping the benefits of price increases, from a trough of 25 cents a pound to a current 40 cents after a nickel-a-pound price increase, effective last Friday.    But the latest earnings forecasts leave some skeptics shaking their heads. Jack Henry, who just moved from E.F. Hutton to Merrill Lynch, is looking for only $5.85 a share for 1988 because he cut all his companies' estimates after the crash on the assumption that this year would bring a recession. Even without one, he can see only $6.50 or $7 a share in earnings, so he remains neutral on the stock and wouldn't chase it.    &quot;I think there's a lot of slippage that could occur in these (polyethylene) price increases,&quot; Mr. Henry warns.    Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache, who recommends the stock short term based on its earnings momentum and expects $9.25 a share in 1988, doesn't think the 1989 earnings can deliver the kind of extra kick PaineWebber predicts. Mr. Bogner thinks polyethylene margins will peak in 1989, and says the stock is &quot;getting closer&quot; to his &quot;fair value&quot; price target of 85.    Quantum has already rebounded from a post-crash low below 50, to within 10 points of its pre-crash 1987 high. Chemical analyst Robert Reitzes of Mabon Nugent, who recommended it last year at 38, says, &quot;I think when stocks make strong moves like this, you've got to re-evaluate.&quot;    Even the company, which just completed a four million-share buy-back, hasn't been buying since the price was in the mid-60s.    Fears of an early inventory buildup that might weaken demand for plastics were eased this week by comments from analysts William Young and Charles LoCastro of Drexel Burnham Lambert, who told clients, &quot;We feel demand should hold up in a reasonable economy.&quot;    Mr. Young says his own 1988 earnings estimate of $7.30, which hasn't been revised in the past month, &quot;may be a little on the low side.&quot; But he is neutral on the stock, believing there are better buys in the more diversified Dow Chemical and Himont, a polypropylene maker.    The story is pretty well known by now how extensively plastics have been replacing other materials, from glass bottles to paper bags to metal cans. Polyethylene is also a play on the falling dollar because, even though Quantum doesn't sell much abroad, its competitors do. This siphons supplies from the U.S., as the lower dollar makes U.S. plastic cheaper overseas.    The main risks to the stock price include a weaker economy or recession, an extended rebound in the dollar and expansion of polyethylene industry capacity. There remains a threat of legal curbs against plastic packaging for environmental reasons. New York Mayor Ed Koch, among others, has been campaigning against McDonald's Corp.'s hamburger containers.    After the name change, Quantum started trading Monday under the new symbol &quot;CUE,&quot; chosen because it sounds like the letter &quot;Q.&quot; A spokesman said Quantum would have preferred just &quot;Q&quot; as its symbol. But on the Big Board, that letter denotes bankruptcy.    ---   Quantum Chemical   (NYSE; Symbol: CUE)   Business: Polyethylene chemicals, propane marketing   Year ended Dec. 31, 1986:   Sales: $1.73 billion   Net Income: $75.6 million; or $2.21 a share -   Third quarter, Sept. 30, 1987:   Net Income: 84 cents vs. 27 cents   Average daily trading volume:   195,000 shares   Common shares outstanding: 29 million</TEXT></DOC>
