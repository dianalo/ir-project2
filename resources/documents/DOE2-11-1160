<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-11-1160 </DOCNO><TEXT>A system of image processing and analysis utilities for a general-purposehypercube topology concurrent multiprocessor system is described. Thepurpose of the system is to provide an efficient development and run-timeenvironment for theoretical and experimental inquiry into computationalvision for mobile and manipulative robots. An additional objective isto provide an environment with rich support for the development of concurrentcomputer vision algorithms. A number of principles for programming concurrentsystems are embodied in the implementation of this system. In particular,all significant computation is performed by the hypercube proper, reservingthe host processor exclusively for input/output functions. One consequenceof this principle is that applications are developed by viewing the concurrentmultiprocessor as a single computer with a special internal structure,rather than as a number of independent machines. Applications derivefrom a single source, rather than many, reducing development time withoutsacrificing run-time efficiency. This document serves as an introductionto the image processing and analysis system, its principles of operation,and as a reference manual for its use. 21 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
