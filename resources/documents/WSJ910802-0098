The findings came in a retrospective analysis byresearchers from the National Cancer Institute and theHarvard University School of Public Health. The researcherslooked at what happened to 55 acquired immune deficiencysyndrome patients treated between 1985 and 1990 with theWellcome PLC drug AZT.</LP><TEXT>   The study found that all but one of the 44 deaths in thegroup so far occurred when the patients' infection-fightingT4 cells had fallen below a level of 50 cells per cubiccentimeter. Normal levels are about 1,000 or more, but AIDScauses a gradual depletion of these immune sentry cells.   T4 cells are a type of white blood cell that are a mainpart of the immune system.   The study adds to a growing consensus that such markers ofimmune-system health may serve as an alternate measure ofdrug effectiveness. Historically, the Food and DrugAdministration has demanded proof that a drug produced alonger or better-quality life for patients.   Study leader Robert Yarchoan of the National CancerInstitute emphasized that falling below 50 T4 cells isn't anautomatic death sentence, as most patients continued to havemedian survival of a year and some lived three times thatlong. However, it is considered a &quot;hazard level,&quot; accordingto a report of the study published in today's edition of theAnnals of Internal Medicine.   Carl Peck, head of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluationand Research, said the study strengthens the case for usingimmune markers in clinical trials. Recently, T4 cell levelswere a major reason for a panel recommendation of FDAapproval for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s drug DDI.   &quot;This looks interesting,&quot; Dr. Peck said of the report.&quot;It's certainly part of the {evidence} that has persuaded us&quot;of the significance of T4 cells. However, he declined topredict whether the study would affect the outcome of pendingdrug applications such as Roche Holding Ltd.'s for its AIDSdrug DDC. Dr. Peck added that the idea of using the level of50 cells per cubic centimeter as &quot;a landmark&quot; of diseaseprogression needs to be confirmed in other studies.</TEXT></DOC>
