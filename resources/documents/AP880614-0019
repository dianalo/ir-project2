Dukakis was in Washington to address a NATO group, plugging hisalternative to President Reagan's Star Wars program and his plansfor strengthening the European alliance.   And Jesse Jackson continued his conciliatory mood by saying hecould rally supporters behind Dukakis even if the all-but-certainDemocratic nominee did not choose Jackson for the No. 2 spot on theticket.   Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas, point man in theDemocrat's search for a running mate, was to spend several days inWashington starting today to discuss vice presidential prospects.   Campaign aides said Brountas would seek advice from members ofCongress and other Democratic Party leaders but declined to namethem.   Dukakis gave the Atlantic Council, a private, pro-NATO group,his assessment of the recent U.S.-Soviet summit and called fornegotiations between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries on conventionalmilitary forces.</TEXT><HEAD>(Begin embargoed material)</HEAD><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   ``We don't need SDI; we need CDI, the Conventional DefenseInitiative begun by leaders in the Congress to apply advancedtechnology to the challenge of fighting and winning a conventionalwar,'' the Massachusetts governor said.   Dukakis praised the U.S.-Soviet treaty banningintermediate-range nuclear missiles, and he hailed PresidentReagan's stance on human rights at the recent Moscow summit.   But Dukakis also criticized the administration, saying theUnited States should never again ``announce radical changes in ourstrategic doctrine or adopt dramatic new bargaining positions onnuclear weapons without consulting our allies in advance.''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   (End embargoed material)   Bush met on Monday with members of the Cuban-American NationalFoundation, an anti-Castro group. ``There have been noaccommodations made with Castro's corrupt communist government bythis administration and, if I may inject a partisan point, Iguarantee you there will be no accommodations'' during a Bushpresidency, he said.   The private organization has agreed to help resettle some 4,000Latin Americans in this country.   Dukakis engaged in a form of one-upmanship with Bush on SouthAfrica after the vice president went beyond the usually tameadministration stance and labeled South Africa a ``racist state.''   When informed of that comment, Dukakis called for aninternational boycott of South Africa, saying it ``not only isengaging in blatant racism and terrorism, it is engaging in nakedaggression against its neighbors.''   Jackson headed from Chicago to Salt Lake City today to addressthe U.S. Conference of Mayors after meeting on Monday with theeditorial boards of the Chicago Tribune and Johnson Publishing Co.,which prints Ebony and Jet magazines.   Even if Dukakis picks someone else, Jackson told reporters inChicago, the Massachusetts governor could look for backing from him``so long as our agreements are rational, fair and consistent.''   But Jackson noted that major differences remain, includingDukakis' refusal to join him in supporting a military spendingfreeze and tax hikes aimed at upper-income Americans.   Jackson said he planned to deliver several major policy speechesbefore the convention outlining his programs for health care,education, the war on drugs, and foreign and defense policy.   Dukakis was leaving behind budget troubles in the MassachusettsStatehouse. The governor met for an hour Monday with aides andlegislative leaders in Boston about the projected $400 milliondeficit his administration faces.   Dukakis's presidential campaign has taken a hard line againstfederal tax increases. One participant in the Massachusetts meetingindicated that the possibility of new state taxes was discussed,but no decisions were made.   Bush received some encouraging news from the latest Harris poll,which showed him gaining slightly on Dukakis.   Dukakis, who held a seven-point lead in the same poll in May anda double-digit advantage in other surveys, received 49 percentsupport in the latest poll to Bush's 44 percent. Seven percentremained uncommitted.   The Lou Harris andamp; Associates telephone survey of 1,258 likelyvoters was conducted June 1-6. The results each had a margin oferror of plus or minus three percentage points, meaning the Dukakislead was within the margin.</TEXT></DOC>
