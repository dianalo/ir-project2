Grisdela (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO EMI </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal government ran a budget surplus of $16.09 billion in January, the Treasury said, largely because of a one-time shift in Social Security payments.    In January 1987 there was a $2.12 billion deficit.    The government's receipts typically rise in January because certain tax payments are due, but last month's budget surplus was largely from technical factors that artificially lowered outlays, analysts say. Most significantly, this January's Social Security payments were made on Dec. 31. The payments were moved up because New Year's Day fell on a Friday and the payments otherwise couldn't have been made until Jan. 4.    This shift was responsible for inflating outlays in December and correspondingly reducing outlays in January. Net outlays for Social Security last month totaled $652 million, down from about $34.9 billion in December and about $17 billion in January 1987.    Last month's budget surplus followed a revised deficit of $24.22 billion in December, originally set at $23.88 billion.    In its monthly statement, the Treasury said federal government receipts totaled $81.79 billion last month, compared with $81.77 billion a year earlier and $85.53 billion in December. Federal outlays totaled $65.71 billion last month, compared with $83.89 billion a year earlier and $109.74 billion in December.    For the first four months of fiscal 1988, which began last Oct. 1, the deficit totaled $65.81 billion, compared with $66.29 billion during a year earlier.    The deficit for all of fiscal 1987 was $150.4 billion. The Reagan administration formally estimates a deficit of $146.7 billion for the current year, though many private analysts predict a deficit in the range of $160 billion to $175 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
