 Theseworkhorses keep churning out charts, slides, and presentations with style andefficiency.andP;  New releases of two top DOS-based presentation graphicsprograms-Harvard Graphics 3.0 from Software Publishing Corporation andFreelance Graphics 4.0 from Lotus Development-show there's still plenty oflife in these old favorites.andM;Both upgrades make it easier to get at sophisticated features that have beenhidden behind awkward, confusing interfaces.andP;  The innovative, icon-drivendrawing interface in Harvard Graphics 3.0 in particular proves that you don'tneed Windows to create complex, eye-popping presentation graphics with ease.andO;Lotus hasn't gone quite as far in making its product easier to use, but it'ssure moved in the right direction.andM;As for drawbacks, neither package creates thumbnail views of a presentationso that you can review edit and reorder it as a whole.andP;  If you frequentlyneed to rearrange the order of the slides or images in your presentation, orif you like to have a large pool of images to draw from in setting up apresentation, look elsewhere.andP;  Or wait for the forthcoming Windows version ofeach package.andP;  Most important of the slew of features added to HarvardGraphics 3.0 are its thoroughly revamped drawing and animation tools.andO;Version 2.3 had two separate drawing modules.andP;  Both had awkward interfaces,and it wasn't always clear when you should use one over the other.andP;  Version3.0 changes all that.andP;  Now there's just one module, and it's richly featured,slick, icon-based, and exceptionally easy to use.andM;The new version corrects another shortcoming: font support.andP;  In previousversions, the only fonts available were those few shipped with the package.andO;Version 3.0 makes use of Bitstream Speedo fonts.andP;  Seven typefaces, each withseveral style variations, are shipped with HG 3.0 (which should be availablein late June).andP;  Plus, a large type library of other fonts is available fromBitstream.andM;As you'd expect from a presentation package upgrade, there are more charttypes, as well as more color palettes and symbols.andP;  The program now importsbitmapped files in .PCX and TIFF formats, and it makes use of extended andexpanded memory.andP;  There are live data links to Lotus 1-2-3, Excel, and ASCIIfiles, and the interface of the entire program, not just its drawing module,has been streamlined.andM;Not that everything is perfect.andP;  The interface is still more difficult to usethan it should be.andP;  Function keys, for example, perform different tasksdepending on context: F4 lets you switch to the drawing program, import datafrom a spreadsheet, or add special effects to a presentation, depending onwhere you are.andP;  And HG 3.0 doesn't support 8088 and 8086 PCs.andM;Even so, this is a significant upgrade, and well worth the cost.andP;  With it,Harvard Graphics breaks new ground and remains the best DOS-basedpresentation package.andP;  If Software Publishing's Windows-based version, duelate this year, is as good as this upgrade, then the company will haveanother winner on its hands.andP;  Like HG 3.0, Freelance Graphics' interface hasbeen cleaned up and simplified, too.andP;  Lotus has given the DOS-based programWysiwyg attributes and made it far easier to use.andP;  For example, you're nolonger forced to work with &quot;stick&quot; fonts that look nothing like what'sprinted.andP;  Instead, the program provides device-specific displays, so youronscreen fonts precisely match what your printer produces.andP;  Like HarvardGraphics, Freelance supports Bitstream Speedo fonts, and Bilstream's Dutchand Swiss outline fonts come with the package.andP;  Moreover, the font fidelityis matched by color fidelity: The colors Freelance displays when you create achart will closely approximate the output of your color printer.andM;Freelance 4.0 adds a gallery of 55 chart types to make creating new chartseasier.andP;  Ninety presentation backgrounds have been added.andP;  Like HarvardGraphics, Freelance now allows users to create global backdrops to unifypresentations.andP;  Extra chart types, more symbols and backdrops, and betterlinking of charts to outside data round out the program's new features.andP;  Inaddition, the new Freelance has a charting composition feature thatautomatically recomposes the sizes of images to fit the aspect ratio of yourcomputer screen.andM;One of the package's more interesting new capabilities stems from theinclusion of a customized version of Symantec's Grandview outliner, calledGrandview LT.andP;  This feature allows you to build outlines that areautomatically converted to Freelance text charts.andP;  While most presentationprograms aren't well suited to composing text, Grandview LT is ideal for thepurpose.andP;  Establish an outline, then choose text colors and attributes fromwithin Grandview, and the outline will automatically generate an entirepresentation of text-based slides in Freelance.andP;  You can then edit thepresentation, or add graphics, from Freelance.andM;Equally important is improved mouse support.andP;  For the first time, you candirectly manipulate charts and objects with a mouse rather than from thekeyboard.andP;  Also, many style options can now be chosen with a mouse.andM;Although the Freelance 4.0 upgrade is significant, there are some problems.andO;Despite improvements, Freelance Graphics' interface remains somewhatdaunting.andP;  The program can't import.PCX files.andP;  And the addition ofGrandView, while a good idea, was only a half-way measure because theprograms are not well integrated; shuttling work between them can beconfusing.andM;Lotus is working on a Windows-based version that will undoubtedly be simplerto use than the DOS version-solving the DOS version's biggest shortcoming.andO;Meanwhile, for existing Freelance users in particular, this new versionshould go over very well.andM;Decision TimeandM;Of these two packages, many people will find Harvard Graphics 3.0 the betterprogram, primarily because its drawing component is superior.andP;  But textcharts make up a large percentage of what people actually create withpresentation packages, according to Lotus.andP;  So, anyone who mainly createstext charts would do well to consider Freelance because of its incorporationof Grandview.andP;  Both of these programs are rock-solid and worthy contendersthat can still beat Windows at its own game-graphics.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
