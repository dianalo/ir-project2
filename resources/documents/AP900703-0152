Iliescu made his remarks during a ceremony at which heofficially confirmed the appointments of Prime Minister PetreRoman's new 23-member Cabinet.   He made his first public statement in support of the economicreform program that Roman outlined to Parliament last week. At thetime, Parliament declared its backing for the program and Roman'sCabinet nominees.   Iliescu's National Salvation Front, which has dominated thegovernment since the December revolution that toppled Communistdictator Nicolae Ceausescu, handily won the May 20 elections on aplatform that promised a slower pace of change that would avoideconomic upheaval.   In his speech to Parliament last week, Roman said that onlyradical reforms aimed at transforming the centrally plannedsocialist system to a market economy could overcome the country'seconomicy crisis. While avoiding specifics, Roman pledged topresent an initial package of reforms to Parliament within sixmonths.   Iliescu told the new ministers that ``all social groups andpolitical forces cannot but adhere to such a program.''   But he warned that the ``transition from a super-centralizedstructure ... toward a market economy based on natural forces''will be a difficult task.   ``To govern under the present conditions of our country andremove it from the profound economic and spiritual crisis will notbe easy,'' Iliescu said.   Unlike Roman, Iliescu stressed in his speech that the reformsmust be accompanied by ``a wide-ranging social protection program.''   The ceremony, which was attended by Romanian journalists butclosed to the foreign press, was held at Iliescu's new headquartersat Cotroceni Palace, the former headquarters of the scout movement.   Last week, Roman blamed the foreign press for distorting theevents of June 13-15, when security forces broke up a 53-dayopposition demonstration that had blocked Bucharest's main downtownsquare.   Roman said Romania's image had been ``inadmissibly damaged'' bythe reporting on the disturbances in the capital that left sixpeople dead.   The foreign ministry on Tuesday issued a protest to Hungary forits official criticism of the violence.   The ministry said the Hungarians were only considering theevents of June 14-15 when thousands of miners responded to agovernment appeal for support and beat up students and othergovernment opponents in Bucharest.   It said the Hungarians were ``knowingly forgetting'' the eventsof June 13 when demonstrators attacked several government buildingsafter security forces broke up the demonstration on UniversitySquare.   The United States reacted to the government's role in theviolence by suspending all non-humanitarian aid to Romania.   On Tuesday, Iliescu sent President Bush a message for the Fourthof July expressing the hope that ``relations between the twocountries develop along new lines in a spirit of faith and mutualrespect.''   In Bucharest, various student groups concluded a two-daycongress with an appeal to the government to release jailed studentleader Marian Munteanu.   Munteanu, the president of the Bucharest University StudentLeague, was an organizer of anti-government demonstrations. He wasamong those beaten by miners and was arrested from his hospital bed.   In their appeal, the students said Munteanu ``had become asymbol of the non-violence of the student movement for democracyand liberty.''</TEXT></DOC>
