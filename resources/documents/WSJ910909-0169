Remains Target   In Defense Probe   ---   Despite Firm's Guilty Plea,   Investigation Continues   On Bribe, Fraud Charges   ----   By Andy Pasztor   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/09/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A6</SO><CO>   UIS WX</CO><MS>INDUSTRIAL (IDU)TECHNOLOGY (TEC)</MS><IN>AEROSPACE (ARO)COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS AND EQUIPMENT (ELQ)</IN><GV>DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)PENNSYLVANIA (PA)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Several former high-ranking Unisys Corp. andAir Force officials remain prime targets of federalprosecutors despite the company's historic guilty plea topaying millions of dollars in bribes, illegal campaigncontributions and phony consulting fees.   Individuals under stepped-up investigation, according tocourt documents and law-enforcement officials, include SteveMonas, former head of a Unisys marketing office for the AirForce, along with a former senior civilian manager of amilitary research facility at Griffiss Air Force Base in NewYork state.</LP><TEXT>   With the help of other Unisys executives, Mr. Monasoperated an $18 million &quot;slush fund&quot; through the late 1980sintended to corrupt Pentagon officials, funnel illegalcampaign funds to congressmen, and secretly reward a group ofconsultants for obtaining illicit bid-related informationfrom the military, according to investigators and a statementof facts filed by the government with the plea. Mr. Monascouldn't be reached to comment.   Friday's $190 million plea agreement with Unisys, thelargest Pentagon fraud settlement ever, provides a spate ofnew details about the company's widespread bid-riggingschemes and the likely direction of the ongoing criminalinvestigation code named &quot;Operation Ill Wind.&quot;   For the first time, prosecutors disclosed that some of theAir Force's most closely held radar and air-defense programswere tainted by the schemes, including the so-called NorthWarning network across Alaska and Canada designed to trackSoviet nuclear missiles. The settlement, for instance,requires Unisys to forgo all of its anticipated profit --about $46 million -- for work on that project. But under theterms of the agreement, Unisys, which has received aboutone-fifth of its annual revenue from defense work, isn'tbarred from receiving new business from the Air Force or anyother part of the federal government.   The statement of facts filed by prosecutors provides thestrongest evidence yet that other high-ranking Unisysexecutives, who haven't been implicated so far, knew aboutmany of the illegal schemes years ago. In January 1988,according to the documents, then-Unisys Vice PresidentCharles Gardner told an associate that &quot;he had explained to ahigh-ranking Unisys official how he, Gardner, operated andthat the official understood the purpose&quot; of sham consultingagreements. Mr. Gardner, who is cooperating with prosecutors,is the highest-ranking former Unisys official or consultantconvicted of breaking the law.   In Blue Bell, Pa., Unisys Chairman James Unruh said theillegal behavior &quot;had its roots&quot; in Sperry Corp., one of twocompanies that merged to create Unisys in 1986. &quot;We havedealt with it forthrightly and have learned from a difficultperiod.&quot;   The grand jury inquiry, among other things, is delvinginto contacts between Mr. Gardner and executives at severalother major contractors, Westinghouse Electric Corp., whichteamed up with the company to try to snare portions ofmultibillion-dollar Pentagon contracts that later turned outto be tainted by influence-peddling or outright bribery.   Overall, Unisys agreed to plead guilty to nine feloniesand settle all civil overcharge claims against it stemmingfrom four separate federal cases. In addition to turning overprofits from the radar program, the company must pay $54million in cash over five years, with payments of as much as$90 million more dependent on future asset sales andprofitability. Prosecutors also said that before theagreement was signed, Unisys voluntarily agreed not to passon to the Pentagon about $18 million of overhead chargesinvolving suspect consulting agreements.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          SEVERAL FORMER UNISYS Corp. officials remain targets inthe federal investigation of defense consultants known as&quot;Operation Ill Wind.&quot; A headline in yesterday's editionincorrectly said Unisys, which has agreed to plead guilty toseveral charges in the case, was itself still a target.
