In order to clarify the influenceof harmonic wave component contained in the voltage wave of inverteron the three phase squirrel cage induction motor, the distribution ofrotating flux and harmonic flux density component were studied with modelcores of rotor and stator. The inverter used in the test was a panelsystem of 5kVA and a variable cycle one using a power transistor in theinverter circuet. The model cores are composed of the stator and rotorcores used for 5kW rated three phase squirrel cage induction motor. Fluxeswere measured at the still condition of rotor. Holes of 5mm were drilledin cores to locate the orthogonal search coils. Locuses of flux densityvectors were determined from the output power; the magnetic field wasanalyzed at rotating condituon with the finite element analysis; andthe flux flow behavior by the inverter drive was analyzed. It was clarifiedthat the influence of harmonic flux component is remarkable in the inverterdrive and the loss is increased by the superimposition. (16 figs, 7 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
