In the second paragraph the article states that the Macintosh &quot;was the labor of love of a handful of renegade engineers who virtually seceded from the rest of Apple, rallying around the charismatic Mr. Jobs and a pirate flag.&quot;    I created the concept for the Macintosh (and its name) in 1979, writing a business plan, user interface design, hardware and software specification, and outlining the positioning of the new product. I presented my plan to then-chairman Mike Markkula, who approved the idea. It was moved away from Apple's headquarters to avoid Mr. Jobs, who was adamantly opposed to the idea (which makes all the more ironic his later claims to have invented it). Mr. Jobs felt that the Lisa computer project was the one that would be the successor to the Apple II in continuing Apple Computer's profitability; I had the temerity to disagree.    After two years my group had produced working prototypes that demonstrated the value of the concept to the company. It was only then that Mr. Jobs took over, by fiat, and brought my concept to market.    Jef Raskin   Chief Executive Officer   Information Appliance Inc.   Menlo Park, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
