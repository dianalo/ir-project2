The House on Thursday approved President Bush's $157 billionbailout package for the foundering savings and loan industry.   In so doing, it resoundingly defeated industry-backed efforts toweaken the cornerstone of reform contained in the measure, despitethe best efforts of Sandamp;L lobbyists.   ``The anger and outrage that seems to be welling up in Americacanceled out the special pleadings of the Sandamp;L industry,'' said BertEly, an Alexandria, Va., financial analyst.   The industry's largest trade group, the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions, until recently had a reputation for effectivenessrivaling such not-to-be-crossed groups as the National RifleAssociation and the American Association of Retired Persons. Thatappears to have changed.   ``Clearly the tide has turned,'' said economist Robert Litan ofthe Brookings Institution, a public policy research group. ``They'reon the run.''   Before House passage of the Sandamp;L bill, the league and independentSandamp;L lobbyists pulled out all stops to preserve an accounting breakknown as supervisory good will. It relieves about a fourth of theindustry from rules requiring Sandamp;L owners to risk their own capitalahead of depositors' money.   The industry distributed buttons, bought full-page newspaperadvertisements and sent Sandamp;L executives roaming the halls of Congressto buttonhole hometown congressmen.   It was all to no avail. The House rebuffed the industry by asuprisingly lopsided 326-94 vote after Bush threatened to veto thebill if it included a weakening amendment offered by Rep. Henry J.Hyde, R-Ill.   ``A populist wind was sweeping across the House,'' said Rep.Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking Committee andone of the most vocal advocates of tough Sandamp;L standards. ``... Ithink the Sandamp;L industry will never be the powerful force it oncewas.''   Publicly, the administration is crediting bipartisancongressional leadership for the vote while also passing word thatBush's last-minute pressure was what actually sealed the Sandamp;L lobby'sfate.   ``Unquestionably the biggest factor was the president'sdetermination and leadership and his willingness to draw a line inthe sand,'' said an official who asked not to be quoted by name.   Schumer and other Democrats charge that Bush weighed in onlyafter it was clear he would be embarrassed by the spectacle ofDemocrats overcoming Republican opposition to win a victory for thepresident.   ``We couldn't have done it alone,'' acknowledged Richard Breeden,Bush's key adviser on Sandamp;Ls. But, he added, ``What you've seen hasbeen active presidential leadership.''   ``I think Congress has responded to it in the very finesttradition of showing bipartisan spirit in solving major nationalproblems,'' he said.   Democrats also would have faced image problems if they had votedwith the industry. Their House leaders, Jim Wright of Texas and TonyCoelho of California, were driven from their posts in part byallegations they granted special favors to the Sandamp;L industry.   ``I think the new Democratic leadership did not want to see aheadline written: `House Caves To Sandamp;L Lobby.' ... That's probablythe key factor,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice presidentof the Independent Bankers Association of America, which representssmall banks.   Even more than the Hyde amendment vote, the subsequent success ofa parliamentary maneuver, pressed by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, showshow much the Sandamp;L lobby has slipped.   Leach wanted to delete more than a half dozen provisions,benefiting large Sandamp;Ls and some of the nation's most powerfulcompanies, including Citicorp, Merrill Lynch and Sears, Roebuck andamp;Co. But, he was denied the chance by the House Rules Committee.   Shortly before 11 p.m. Thursday, with House members anxious to gohome after a 13-hour session, Leach used a parliamentary maneuver toforce a vote on removing special exceptions that had been insertedby such senior banking committee members as Reps. Doug Barnard,D-Ga., Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Carroll Hubbard, D-Ky. Leach won411-8.   A House aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theBanking Committee's phone lines were flooded after midnight Thursdaywith calls from outraged lobbyists wanting to know how Leach couldhave succeeded.   ``It's amazing, absolutely amazing that that sort of (measure) tostrike out all the goodies passed almost unanimously,'' Guenthersaid.   Leach said he believes ``reform sentiment is growing in theCongress'' and members were unwilling to ask their constituents topay for a bailout that included special exceptions.   But Litan of the Brookings Institution said so many House membershad lost battles for hometown institutions that they weren't willingto approve breaks for banking committee insiders.   The reasoning, according to Schumer, was ``Why make seven oreight exceptions when you're not making others.''   The House bill, probably after the July 4 recess, goes to aconference with the Senate, which passed its Sandamp;L bill in April. Sandamp;Llobbyists, despite their defeat in the highly visible venue of theHouse floor, will try again to wrest concessions in the less publicconference.   ``This is seen as desperation time by the Sandamp;Ls and they're goingto be working harder than ever on the conferees. I'd give 50-50 oddsthat we're going to end up with something weaker than the Housebill,'' said Ely, the analyst in Alexandria, Va.   ``We know that all kinds of strange and wonderous things happenin conference. ... The two-week recess provides plenty of time foran awful lot of stuff to be worked out,'' he said. </TEXT></DOC>
