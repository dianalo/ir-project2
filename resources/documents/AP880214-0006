(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Presidential candidates plunged Saturdayinto the final weekend of campaigning before New Hampshire'sdo-or-die primary, with Democrats staging a spirited debate andRepublican Sen. Bob Dole encountering hecklers from oppositioncamps.   Dole, locked in a tight race in New Hampshire with VicePresident Geroge Bush, was campaigning at a shopping mall inBedford when he found himself surrounded by chanting supporters ofBush and Rep. Jack Kemp.   The scene quickly became a shouting contest with sign-wavingsupporters from the three campaigns vying for attention. Theshouting cointinued in the parking lot after Dole's motorcadedeparted.   The Democratic debaters engaged in a little shouting of theirown, with Jesse Jackson acting as peacemaker and urging his rivalsto stick to the issues and stop playing ``how bruised I am.''   The debate heated up quickly with Rep. Richard Gephardt and Sen.Paul Simon continuing their running dispute over Simon commercialsthat attack Gephardt. Then Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Gephardt had arun-in over remarks Gephardt's campaign manager made about Gore.   New Hampshire Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis attackedGephardt for accepting money from political action committees andalso for supporting an oil import fee.   At times it was hard to distinguished who was shouting at whom.   ``What's your energy policy,'' former front-runner Gary Hartasked the Massachusetts governor.   ``This is a budget issue,'' chimed in former Gov. Bruce Babbittof Arizona.   ``Can I finish my answer?'' asked Dukakis.   The nationally televised one-hour debate, sponsored by theLeague of Women Voters, took place at St. Anselm College inGoffstown.   The League was sponsoring a Republican debate at the college onSunday.   Meanwhile, two polls showed Bush and Dole locked in a tie forthe lead in New Hampshire's Republican primary, with Dukakisenjoying a solid advantage among Democrats.   An ABC-Washington Post poll gave Bush and Dole each 29 percent.Kemp, Pat Robertson and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont were tiedfor third with 12 percent. Dukakis had 40 percent with Gephardt andSimon each at 16 percent.   The poll was based on interviews with 375 likely Democraticprimary voters and 373 likely Republican primary voters over threedays ending Friday. It had a margin of error of plus or minus fivepercentage points for the Democrats and six percentage points forthe Republican sample.   The Sunday Boston Globe said its poll of 789 New Hampshirevoters surveyed Thursday, Friday and Saturday showed 39 percent ofthe Democrats for Dukakis, with 14 percent for Gephardt and 13percent for Simon.   Dole was favored by 32 percent of the likely Republican voters,and Bush had 28 percent. Ten percent were undecided. The poll had amargin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.   At his first campaign stop of the day, Gephardt, the winner inIowa last Monday, warned his rivals _ particularly Simon _ thatnegative campaigning now could hurt the party's chance to win thepresidency.   ``We're not going to win this if we're brawling in the mud,''said Gephardt, who has been the target of Simon commercialsfocusing on the Missouri congressman's votes in favor of the B-1bomber and nuclear power.   Kemp of New York, whose candidacy hinges on the support of NewHampshire Republican voters on Tuesday, unveiled a new televisioncommercial attacking Dole for not being effective enough in thefight to get congressional approval of aid to the NicaraguanContras.   Kemp spokesman John Buckley described Dole as ``relativelypassive on the issue'' of Contra aid.   When the congressman was asked if his candidacy could survive afinish behind Robertson on Tuesday, he replied: ``He's not going tobeat me in New Hampshire.''   Dog sled races in Laconia drew Kemp, Bush and Dukakis, while duPont went rummaging for votes at the Bedford town dump.   Noticing campaign workers for Dole and Bush passing outliterature at the dump, which attracts 400 to 500 people on aSaturday, du Pont said, ``Here's a real candidate.''   Dukakis, at an appearance in Dover, shrugged off criticism in aGephardt television commercial that called him ``one of the biggesttax raisers in Massachusetts history.''   ``I've cut taxes five times in the last four years,'' Dukakissaid, adding that he did not want to see the Democrats lettingthemselves ``disintegrate into the kind of backyard squabbling thatBush and Dole have been involved in.''   Robertson toured shopping malls on the seacoast, shaking handsand telling people, ``I need some help on Tuesday.''   The former evangelist told reporters, ``It's a horserace all theway, and I think we might see some surprises come Tuesday night.But the momentum is on my side right now and that's the good way tobe at this stage.''   Bush appeared at a high school in Wolfeboro with Gov. John H.Sununu and Hall of Fame baseball player Ted Williams and was on theoffensive against Dole.   ``I think Bob is making some statements that are prettyextravagant,'' said the vice president. ``Bob Dole says when RonaldReagan wants something done he calls Bob Dole. But when he wantedsomebody to be the vice presidnt of the United States, he calledme.''   In addition to his campaigning, Robertson was the candidatefeatured this weekend in the televised interviews by David Frost,part of the series called, ``The Next President.''   Asked about Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, the former televisionevangelist said, ``I wouldn't have hesitated to kill him. He's amadman and he was a terrorist.''   Dole picked up the endorsement of former defense secretaryDonald Rumsfeld who dreamed of being one of the GOP candidates buteventually decided against entering the race.   Also appearing with Dole at Jaffrey was former Secretary ofState Alexander M. Haig Jr., who dropped out of the race on Fridayand endorsed the Kansan.   Addressing a rally at Conant High School, Dole said, ``Somepeople say Bob Dole is pretty tough. You better hope I'm tough.We're talking about our future. We're talking about our children'sfuture. We're talking about our grandchildren.''   It was clear that Dole's victory in Iowa coupled with Bush'sembarrassing third-place finish had blown away the big edge thevice president once held in New Hampshire surveys.   New Hampshire could be a last stand for Kemp and du Pont, aswell as for two Democrats, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona andformer Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado.   Kemp said he was confident he'd finish ahead of Robertson in theprimary. Asked if he also had to beat Bush or Dole, he replied,``No, I've got to be competitive. I've got to be up in the packamong the leaders. And that's what our goal is.''   ``You have to do well, you have to start beating somebody,''conceded du Pont, who finished fifth in Iowa and is running thesame in New Hampshire surveys.   The new Kemp ad took swipes at both Dole and Bush on the Contraaid issue.   The commercial said that in the recent House vote that rejectedPresident Reagan's request for more money for the Contras, eightBush supporters were among those who voted against the money. Thead also quoted Dole as telling the Boston Globe ``he wasn'tconcerned about (Nicaraguan president Daniel) Ortega or his army.Is that leadership?''   When reporters asked how Kemp could attack Dole, when thesenator had voted for Contra aid, Buckley said, ``Sure he's votedin the right place. But this guy has run for the last year onleadership. ... Bob Dole has been relatively passive on thisissue.''</TEXT></DOC>
