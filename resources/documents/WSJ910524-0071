The U.S. plans to ask the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade to intervene.   A U.S. request for GATT consultations would follow thesuspension in February of EC-U.S. negotiations aimed atcurbing government subsidies for Airbus, the Europeanaircraft consortium.   Officials from the countries that are part of theconsortium -- Germany, Britain, France and Spain -- heldstrategy talks yesterday with EC officials, who said thecommunity would agree to GATT consultations but prefersdirect negotiations as well as separate talks on revising theGATT code on civil aircraft.   Washington views Airbus as a successful enterprise that istaking market share from U.S. aerospace companies and that nolonger needs heavy government help.                                                                                                          SAUDI ARABIA SEEKS WAR LOANS                                                                                                          Saudi Arabia is said to be seeking a $2.5 billion loanfrom major Saudi banks to help meet some Gulf War costs. Thekingdom this month signed a $4.5 billion credit with a groupof foreign banks, its first dollar borrowing in more than twodecades. The Islamic proscription against usury makesborrowing a sensitive subject. Saudi Arabia is expected touse both loans to pay the $8 billion still owed of its $13.5billion contribution to the U.S. to pay a share of the war'scost.                                                                                                          AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL TURNS 30                                                                                                          As it turns 30 years old next Tuesday, AmnestyInternational continues to break ground in its world-widecampaign for the release and fair treatment of prisoners ofconscience. This year, it achieved its goal of opening aMoscow office, and was allowed to send an observer to a NorthKorean conference. The 1977 Nobel Peace Prize winner has morethan one million members in 150 nations.                                                                                                          ROMANIA TO SUSPEND ADOPTIONS                                                                                                          Adoptions of orphaned and abandoned Romanian children willbe suspended beginning June 1 and probably won't resumebefore September, while lawmakers prepare rules aimed atstopping the burgeoning black market for babies. The numberof couples going to Romania to adopt children has beenrising, and reports are widespread of Westerners going topoor rural areas where parents are selling their children.Since the December 1989 revolution, nearly 7,000 Romanianchildren have been adopted, 1,709 of them by Americans andmost of them in 1991.                                                                                                          NIGERIA BUILDING DEADLINE                                                                                                          Contractors in Nigeria have been racing to completeAbuja's $10 million conference center, dominated by a mosque,and a bridge and road connection to the airport in time forthe 51-member Organization of African Unity summit June 3-5.Construction of Abuja, planned to become the nation's newcapital, began in 1976. The city of about 400,000, mainlycivil servants, is expected to grow to 3.2 million by theyear 2010.                                                                                                          SWISS FIRM OFFERS AMENDS                                                                                                          Ciba-Geigy Ltd. offered to buy back from Tanzania 117,000gallons of insecticide containing the chemical DDT. The Swisschemical and pharmaceutical giant's sale violatedCiba-Geigy's policy, in line with a United Nations code, ofnot selling to Third World countries products banned inindustrialized nations. DDT is banned in the developed worldbecause it poses a severe threat to health. Tanzania placedits order in 1988, prior to Ciba's ban, but payment problemsdelayed one-third of the order until last December.                                                                                                          JAPANESE BANK LIBERALIZATION                                                                                                          Japanese banking regulators received draft proposals fordesegregating the securities and banking business.   Under the auspices of the Finance Ministry's bankingbureau, the Financial System Research Council hopes to makeformal its staff's recommendations -- largely what thefinancial industry expected -- within two weeks. TheSecurities Exchange Council may act on the draft today.   The plan calls for mutual entry by banks and securitiesfirms into each group's business through dedicatedsubsidiaries. For example, new laws would require separateunits for traditional securities dealings and trust banking,and allow commercial banking by long-term credit banks.   Crucial questions remain, such as how much leeway bankswill have to deal in equities and do private placements. Itseems certain banks will get to deal in securitizations,largely through the parent company, and securities firms willbe enabled to handle foreign exchange, through commercialbanking units.

Albania's general strike, in its ninth day, is spreadingand includes about 350,000 workers, the new AlbanianIndependent Trade Unions said. The walkout, mainly because ofa pay dispute with the Communist government, has paralyzedmost main industries. . . . Suriname's caretaker president,Johan Kraag, installed after a bloodless coup in December,welcomed a Pentagon official's remark that the U.S. doesn'trule out invading the South American nation if electionsdon't restore democracy. Surinamese are to vote tomorrow oncloser ties with the Netherlands, but the army is consideredlikely to maintain its grip on the former Dutch colony.</TEXT></DOC>
