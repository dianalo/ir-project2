Younger ones will recall the``Girl from Ipanema'' and bossa nova of the early 1960s. CarmenMiranda and the girl from Ipanema are still a part of Brazilianmusic but there's much more to it these days and it has Americansswaying more than ever to its beat. An AP correspondent who worked2{ years in Brazil and now is assigned to New York traces themusic's evolution from colonial times to the present.</TEXT><BYLINE>By LISA GENASCI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Brazil's melodious blend of African, Portuguese and native Indianrhythms is seducing American ears, and pop stars such as DavidByrne, Paul Simon and Sting, noted for discovering new sounds, arelooking southward.   But hard to capture in the Brazilian-inspired American tunes andthe compilations are the cultural and political roots of Brazilianmusic, which stretches from throbbing samba to the softer bossanova. Some of Brazil's top singer-composers were jailed or exiledfor their allegorical ballads during the 21-year militarydictatorship that ended in 1985.   Three months ago, Byrne of the U.S. rock group The Talking Headsreleased an anthology of Brazilian music from the 1970s, ``BelezaTropical,'' which has sold 100,000 copies. He is putting togethertwo others: a compilation of carnival samba and another of swinging,syncopated ``forro'' from Brazil's northeast.   Byrne and Simon have made pilgrimages to the northeast state ofBahia, the source of Brazilian-African rhythms. Sting has traveledin the Brazilian Amazon region studying Indian music and ceremonies.   Brazilian singers Caetano Veloso and Djavan have made names forthemselves in the United States and recently recorded new albums onAmerican labels. Milton Nascimento, Gal Costa and Hermeto Paschoalhave just completed U.S. tours to wide critical acclaim.Singer-songwriter Gilberto Gil began a U.S. tour in late June.   Record producer Quincy Jones recently described the new interestin the music of Brazil as ``the second wave.'' The first was bossanova, which saxophonist Stan Getz helped bring to the United Statesin his jazz samba records of the early 1960s.   Byrne said he sees a new openness among the American``thirtysomething'' generation to foreign sounds and lyrics thataren't necessarily in English.   ``They're not very interested in Guns and Roses or MichaelJackson, and there's little else,'' Byrne said, referring to theheavy rock band and U.S. light pop star. ``They like things thatseem genuine, not a contrived commodity.''   Larry Gold of the New York nightclub Sounds of Brazil agrees. Hesaid since the barriers fell between black rap and Carribean soundand what was considered ``white'' music, the American public hasopened to regional sounds. Ticket sales at his 300-seat club are up30 percent over last year, he said.   Though some fear the new interest in Brazilian music will lead toa more generic, international sound in Brazil, Gilberto Gildisagrees.   ``I think the new curiosity will bring out more of thecomplexities and contradictions in the music,'' he said.   Brazil, a mixed-race nation of 141 million, was colonized by thePortuguese and now has 55 million people of African descent; about220,000 native Indians live mostly in remote Amazon regions.   ``The music reflects Brazil,'' said Morton Marx, an Americanmusicologist who has studied Brazilian music.   Much of Brazilian music has been characterized as swing, and its``lightness'' is often confused with American easy-listening music.But as Byrne points out, many of Brazil's top singer-composers wentto jail or were sent into exile for their work.   ``It's melodious yet there's a sense of depth,'' Byrne said.``It's very innovative and there's an acceptance of anything. Itreinforces the basic notion of throwing out the rule book.''   Beyond the melody, much of Brazilian pop integrates therudimentary percussion instruments used in Afro-Brazilian spiritcults such as wooden drums known as ``atabaques,'' a three-bellinstrument called an ``agogo'' and something similar to maracarattles used by cha-cha bands.   At the same time, the harmonic tones of Milton Nascimento andfree-wheeling improvisation of instrumentalists such as HermetoPascoal long have inspired jazz musicians Pat Metheney and MilesDavis among others.   The melange of peoples, economic hardship and a history ofgovernment repression in Brazil have created the innovations instructure, lyrics and arrangements of its music.   In coastal Bahia, the rhythms are heavily African, brought by the3.6 million slaves who came from western Africa to work on thesugar, cotton and coffee plantations and later to mine for gold anddiamonds. In Brazil, slavery spanned three centuries from the 1500sthrough abolition in 1888.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
