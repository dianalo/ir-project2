E. Clay Shaw Jr. is a loyal Republicanwho has wrapped himself in President Bush's &quot;no new taxes&quot;pledge. But when it comes to the environment, well, that's adifferent matter.   A few weeks ago, Rep. Shaw introduced a bill proposing anew tax on polystyrene products, often used for fast-foodcontainers. &quot;There's no question it's a tax,&quot; he admits, &quot;butit's a tax I view more as a deterrent than a revenue raiser.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Taxing environmentally harmful activities -- be it thespewing of sulfur dioxide into the air or the manufacture ofpaper without using recycled pulp -- is looking increasinglyattractive on Capitol Hill, as both a means of raisingbillions in revenue and a way of enhancing the environment.&quot;Keep an eye on environmental taxes,&quot; Ronald Pearlman, chiefof staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation,advised tax lawyers recently.   The idea is likely to come up in the current budgetnegotiations between the Bush administration and Congress,and a number of people expect any major deficit-reductionpackage this year will include some kind of environmentaltax. Even if the summit talks fail, environmental taxes arelikely to stay on the table in the coming years. &quot;It could bea big area for tax legislation this year or the next severalyears,&quot; Mr. Pearlman predicts.   Many lawmakers agree. &quot;Clearly that's the direction thechairman of our committee is heading,&quot; says Rep. WilliamArcher of Texas, the ranking Republican on the tax-writingHouse Ways and Means Committee.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the influential Waysand Means chairman, has called for $3.2 billion inunspecified environmental taxes next fiscal year as part of aplan to pare the budget deficit. The Congressional BudgetOffice estimates about $22 billion could be raised in thenext five years through a tax on sulfur-dioxide andnitrogen-oxide emissions -- industrial pollutants that causeacid rain.   At least a dozen pieces of legislation have beenintroduced in Congress this year using the tax code to crackdown on a range of perceived environmental evils, includingsulfur-dioxide, nitrogen-oxide and carbon-dioxide emissions,polystyrene packaging, lumber cut from old redwoods, andproducts made with unrecycled lumber, paper, plastics orglass.   Revenue estimates haven't been completed for many of theproposals, but joint tax committee economists believe anumber of the levies could raise substantial amounts.   &quot;Frankly it's money from heaven,&quot; says Tom Ochsenschlager,a partner in the office of federal tax services at theaccounting firm Grant Thornton. &quot;Bush could go on TV withMillie alongside, pat her on the head, and say this is not atax, it's a user fee. And it's only a user fee for those whopollute the environment. And I'd be just tickled pink if thistax disappeared because the idea is to change behavior.&quot;   The taxes may not fall solely on big corporate polluters.Executives of Southern Co., a big utility holding company,vow to raise electric rates if a proposed tax onsulfur-dioxide emissions is enacted, meaning consumers wouldfoot at least part of the bill. &quot;We couldn't absorb thosekinds of numbers,&quot; says Larry Westbrook, the company's chieffinancial officer. &quot;I'd have to think that whether you're asteel or a chemical plant or any other business, you can'tabsorb costs like this.&quot;   The Bush administration has said it opposes most of theenvironmental-tax bills currently in Congress. But it hasn'tslammed the door completely on the idea. Michael Graetz,deputy assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, told theWays and Means Committee in March that the administration isstudying the possibility of a &quot;virgin materials&quot; tax toencourage recycling. The idea would be to tax the content ofunrecycled raw materials, such as paper or glass, inproducts.   Mr. Graetz said any environmental tax would have tosatisfy several criteria to gain administration support. Forinstance, the levy must address a national -- not a regional-- problem. And it must be easy to administer. Some committeemembers read his remarks as a sign that the administrationcould be receptive to some proposals.   In fact, President Bush has already agreed to anenvironmental levy. Last year he signed into law, as part ofbudget-reconciliation legislation, a new excise tax onchlorofluorocarbons, pollutants that drain the earth'sprotective ozone layer. Administration aides call this a userfee, observes an aide to Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.), whointroduced the legislation.   The tax showed lawmakers that environmental taxes are easyto raise, adds a Ways and Means aide, noting that there isn'tany public outcry about environmental taxes.   At least not so far. But industry, still reeling from theswift approval of the tax on chlorofluorocarbons, isbeginning to mobilize. The day after Earth Day, 46representatives of some of the nation's largest industriesmet in the downtown Washington offices of the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers to plan a lobbying assault onwhat they fear may be a growing trend in taxation.   &quot;We don't want environmental taxes to be included in thechairman's {proposals} for budget reconciliation,&quot; saysMonica McGuire, director of taxation at the manufacturersassociation. But, she adds, &quot;It's a hard tax to defeat.&quot;   That's partly because its a hard tax to fight. Politicallines tend to be drawn by region rather than party. Somepeople say that industries that aren't affected by theproposal don't seem interested in expending much effort tofight them.   But many companies are incensed by the prospect of a newpollution tax on top of stringent new regulations soon to beenacted with the massive clean-air legislation currentlymoving through Congress. Southern Co., which provides powerto four southeastern states, estimates that legislationintroduced by Rep. Stark to tax sulfur-dioxide emissions fromutility companies would cost the company $18 billion by 2013on top of the extra $15 billion the company expects it willhave to pay during that period to comply with the clean-airlaw.   The double whammy, says Mr. Westbrook, is unfair. &quot;We'retalking about an awesome thing that hits us and hits ourcustomers.&quot;   Industry's main line of attack paints environmental taxesas a foe of U.S. competitiveness. &quot;An environmental tax, nomatter how you cut it, by and large taxes U.S.-basedproduction,&quot; says Robert Hill, associate director of taxationfor the Chemical Manufacturers Association. &quot;It's absolutelydetrimental to our competitiveness.&quot;   Such arguments have sunk in with some lawmakers. &quot;I forone think we've got to be awfully careful how we move in thisdirection because of concern for the macroeconomic impact,&quot;Rep. Archer says.   But Rep. Stark, the author of several environmental-taxproposals, insists: &quot;As long as care is given to setting theright tax level, taxes based on environmental degradationoffer the potential of redirecting our economy to a moreefficient allocation of resources, as well as generatingsignificant revenues.&quot;   ---                Estimated Annual Revenue from                Possible Environmental Taxes                                                                                                                                                        ANNUAL                                                REVENUE* TAX                                         (In billions)                                                                                                        $250 per ton on nitrogen-oxide  emissions from utilities and factories          $2.1                                                                                                        $150 per ton on sulfur-dioxide  emissions from utilities and factories           2.6 One-time charge on new vehicles for  estimated pollution emissions rates              2.8                                                                                                        50 cents per pound on water pollutants            2.4                                                                                                        $28 per ton of carbon in fossil fuels            33.2                                                                                                        *When fully in effect                                                                                                        Source: Congressional Budget Office</TEXT></DOC>
