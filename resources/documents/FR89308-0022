The amendment concerns powers of attorney used in connectionwith mileage disclosures and requires NHTSA to promulgate regulations concerningtheir use.  This rule permits, in limited circumstances when a title document is physicallyheld by a lienholder, the use of a secure power of attorney form. It allowsa transferor to make the required odometer disclosure on a secure powerof attorney form, issued by a State, that would authorize the transfereeto exactly restate the mileage on the title document on the transferor'sbehalf. Similarly, this rule allows a transferee to authorize this transferorto sign the disclosure on the title document, on behalf of the transferee.To the extent that they are consistent with the new law, this rule grants,in whole or in part, three petitions for reconsideration.  This notice is published as an interim final rule without notice and theopportunity for comment. However, NHTSA requests comments on this rule.Following the close of the comment period, NHTSA will publish a noticeresponding to the comments and, if appropriate, NHTSA will amend the provisionsof this rule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> Comments on this interim rule are due no later than April7, 1989.

The agency received numerous commentson the NPRM, representing the opinions of new and used car dealers, autoauctions, leasing companies, State motor vehicle administrators, and enforcementand consumer protection agencies. Each of the comments was considered anda final rule was published on August 5, 1988. 53 FR 29464 (1988).  As required by the Truth in Mileage Act, the August 1988 final rule requiresthe transferor of a motor vehicle to provide a mileage disclosure on thetitle document or, if the title document does not include a space for themileage disclosure (during the phase-in period), or if the vehicle hasnot been previously titled, it requires the transferor to make a writtendisclosure of mileage on a separate document. Also as required by thatstatute, that final rule requires that title documents be manufacturedor otherwise set forth by a secure process to deter counterfeiting andalteration; requires that at the time of issue, the titles include themileage disclosure; adds disclosure requirements for lessors and lessees;and adds retention requirements for lessors and auction companies. In addition,consistent with the statute, the rule amends the form and content of theodometer disclosure statement. The August 1988 rule also prohibits a personfrom signing the disclosure as both the transferor and transferee in thesame transaction in order to guard against a situation where only one partyto the transaction would be aware of the disclosure. Finally, that ruleclarifies the definition of transferor and transferee and extends the recordretention requirement for dealers and distributors.  The Agency received seven petitions for reconsideration of the August 1988final rule. In addition, we received numerous letters concerning the finalrule and supporting the petitions. These petitions requested that NHTSAreconsider the provisions of the final rule that: (1) Prohibit a personfrom signing the odometer disclosure statement as both the transferor andtransferee in the same transaction; (2) define ``transferor'' and ``transferee'';(3) define ``secure printing process''; (4) concerned the language includedon the odometer disclosure statement; and (5) require dealers and distributorsto retain, for five years, a copy of every odometer disclosure statement,including the transferee's signature, that they issue and receive. Thesepetitions and letters have been placed in the docket. Before the Agencycould fully consider the petitions, Congress enacted the Pipeline SafetyReauthorization Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-561.  Section 401 of the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act, which amends section408(d)(1) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, 15 U.S.C.1988(d)(1), concerns the use of certain powers of attorney in connectionwith the required mileage disclosure. Although the Truth in Mileage Actgenerally requires that a vehicle seller (or other transferor) make therequired disclosure on the vehicle's title, Congress determined that, undercertain limited conditions when the title document is physically held bya lienholder, the transferor should not be precluded from making the disclosureon a secure power of attorney form which includes a space for the requiredodometer disclosure information. This secure power of attorney form wouldbe given to a buyer (transferee), authorizing him to restate, on the titledocument, the mileage disclosed by the seller on the secure power of attorneyform, if State law otherwise permits. Congress found that precluding suchuses of powers of attorney could cause an undue burden on dealers whena consumer's title is held by a bank or other lienholder. Because the consumerdoes not have the vehicle's title document, the consumer would be unableto complete the disclosure on the title unless: (1) The consumer returnedto the dealer after the dealer paid off the lien and received the titlefrom the lienholder, or (2) the title was mailed by the dealer to the consumer,completed by the consumer, and mailed back to the dealer. Both of thesealternatives were seen by Congress as interfering with usual commercialtransactions. 134 Cong. Rec. H10079 (daily ed. October 12, 1988) (remarksof Rep. Dingell).  To resolve this problem and to alleviate potential costs for dealers andconsumers, the new amendment specifies that a secure power of attorneyform, which includes a mileage disclosure by the transferor, may be usedwhen the transferor's title document is physically held by a lienholder,if otherwise permitted by State law. The new law directs the agency toprescribe the form and content of the power of attorney/disclosure documentand reasonable conditions for its use by the transferor, ``consistent withthis Act and the need to facilitate enforcement thereof.'' More specifically,the new law requires that the form: (1) ``be issued by a State to transfereesin accordance with paragraph (2)(A)(i) * * * '' (Paragraph (2)(A)(i) concernsthe issuance of documents that are set forth by a secure printing processor other secure process.); (2) include an odometer disclosure statementand other information as NHTSA deems necessary; and (3) be submitted tothe State by the person granted the power of attorney. It also requiresNHTSA's rule to provide for the retention of a copy of the power of attorneyand to ensure that the person granted the power of attorney completes thedisclosure on the title consistent with the disclosure on the power ofattorney form.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope  </ITAG>Consistent with the statutory mandate, this interim final rule grants,in whole or in part, three of the petitions for reconsideration. This interimfinal rule also implements the portion of the Pipeline Safety ReauthorizationAct of 1988 that concerns the use of powers of attorney to disclose mileage. NHTSA has also granted, in whole or in part, four petitions for reconsiderationin a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Generally, the NPRM concerns the definitionof transferor and transferee with regard to the person who acts as agentfor the transferor and transferee. It also concerns the relationship betweenthe retention requirement applicable to dealers and distributors and therequirement that the transferee's signature appear on the odometer disclosurestatements.  NHTSA has denied, in whole or in part, three petitions for reconsiderationof the final rule published on August 5, 1988, because they are inconsistentwith the new statute. For reasons discussed in the document denying thepetitions, two other petitions were also denied. The denial notice is publishedin today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Misuse of Powers of Attorney in Odometer Fraud Schemes  </ITAG>Although the July 1987 proposed rule to implement the Truth in MileageAct did not include a regulatory provision explicitly concerning the useof powers of attorney, we stated in the preamble to the proposed rule thatwe recognize that powers of attorney are necessary in certain transactions.Someone acting on behalf of a deceased or incompetent owner would use apower of attorney from those owners to transfer the vehicles to a thirdparty. In addition, the spouse of overseas military personnel, or of someoneout of town or otherwise unavailable, may have a power of attorney froma husband or wife to transfer a vehicle to a third party. However, we emphasizedthat powers of attorney that allow a person to sign a disclosure as boththe transferor and transferee result in only one party to the transactionbeing aware of the previous mileage disclosures. This could jeopardizethe integrity of the ``paper trail,'' the evidence of rollbacks that Congressintended to enhance by enacting the Truth in Mileage Act. 52 FR 27026 (1987). The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), the WisconsinDepartment of Transportation (Wisconsin), and the National Associationof Consumer Agency Administrators (NACAA) agreed with our position. AAMVAnoted that a power of attorney that allows a person to sign the disclosureas both the buyer and the seller creates a situation ripe for fraud, ifthat person is intent on rolling back the vehicle's odometer. Several ofAAMVA's members concurred in this position. Wisconsin suggested that anew paragraph be added to section 580.5 providing that no person may signa disclosure as both the transferor and transferee.  Other commenters, concerned that the title had to be present at the timeof sale (``title present''), hoped that the use of a power of attorneywould ease the burden that title present might have imposed. A coalitionof commenters (the ``coalition''), consisting of AAMVA, the National AutoAuction Association (NAAA), the National Automobile Dealers Association(NADA), the National Independent Automobile Dealers Association (NIADA),the Automotive Trade Association Executives, and the American Car RentalAssociation, suggested the use of a special power of attorney. (Althoughthe coalition used the term ``secure power of attorney,'' we are referringto its suggestion by the term ``special power of attorney.'' This helpsto differentiate between the statutorily permitted secure power of attorneyand the coalition's suggestion.) The coalition proposed that this specialpower of attorney would (1) Be set forth by a secure process; (2) containthe appropriate Federal odometer disclosure statement; and (3) be fullycompleted, dated, and signed by the transferee. Upon receipt of the transferor'stitle, the initial transferee would negotiate the title and complete thetransferor's statement based on the transferor's special power of attorneyand mileage disclosure thereon. The title, together with the special powerof attorney and all subsequent reassignments, would be presented to theState with any application for title.  We reviewed AAMVA's comments and the suggestions of Wisconsin and the coalitionin light of our investigative experience which showed that powers of attorneyhad been abused in the furtherance of odometer fraud schemes. The followingtwo schemes, uncovered during NHTSA's investigations, are illustrativeof the use of a power of attorney to commit odometer fraud:  (A) The transferor, a leasing company, sold several vehicles to a wholesaledealer and gave this dealer a power of attorney to execute the odometerdisclosure statements on its behalf. The buying dealer rolled back theodometer on the vehicles, entered the lower mileage on the disclosure statements,and signed the disclosures as both the buyer and the seller. The buyerthen sent a copy of the statements to the leasing company where they werefiled.  (B) A new car dealer purchased a used vehicle and received a separate odometerdisclosure staement on which his transferor certified that the odometerreflected the actual mileage of the vehicle. The new car dealer sold thecar before he received the title, certifying that the odometer reflectedthe vehicle's actual mileage. The new car dealer then received the title,which had a blatantly altered odometer reading in the reassignment spaceon the reverse side of the title. Using the power of attorney that he receivedfrom his buyer, the new car dealer signed the disclosure as both the transferorand transferee. He never advised his buyer of the mileage problem. [Note:Other title problems that could be ignored by unscrupulous persons includehigher mileage on the face of the title than on the reassignment on thereverse side and a certification that the odometer reading does not reflectthe actual mileage.]  Based on the comments from AAMVA, NACAA, and Wisconsin and our own investigativeexperience, we adopted Wisconsin's suggestion and added a new andSection;580.5(h). This provision prohibits a person from signing the disclosureas both the transferor and transferee in the same transaction.  We did not adopt the suggestion of the coalition of commenters for severalreasons. First, we had modified the proposed requirement in the NPRM ofJuly 1987 that the title be present at the time of transfer of ownershipand addressed the primary concern of the commenters by permitting the disclosureto be made ``in connection with the transfer of ownership,'' rather than``at the time of transfer of ownership.'' Second, we were concerned thatthe coalition's suggestion would interfere with the integrity of the papertrail, which Congress intended to enhance by enacting the Truth in MileageAct. Under the coalition's suggestion, only one party to the transfer wouldsee the odometer disclosure (which would have been on the title). The powerof attorney could be easily discarded and a new one forged and submittedto the State by any of the parties to subsequent transfers, since the issuanceof the special power of attorney forms would not be controlled in any way.Finally, this process would place a burden on State titling offices toreview additional documentation, check for conformity of the informationcontained on the documents, and maintain additional records. Accordingly,the final rule of August 1988 implemented the Truth in Mileage Act, whileallowing the States the maximum discretion in complying with these requirements.53 FR 29469, 29472, 29475 (1988).    <ITAG tagnum="84">Petitions for Reconsideration</ITAG>In petitions filed with the agency, NADA, NIADA, and NAAA asked NHTSA toreconsider andSection; 580.5(h), the provision which prohibits a person fromsigning the disclosure as the transferor and transferee in the same transaction.The agency also received many letters in support of the petitions. Thepetitioners claimed that customers would not return to dealers to signthe disclosure on the title. They alleged that a customer's failure toreturn would result in costs associated with locating these people, administrativecosts for mailing and/or duplicating titles, and increased inventory costsin States where the dealer must have the title present at time of sale.This would result in higher vehicle prices as dealers would pass theseexpenses on to the consumer. Alternatively, they argued that if customersdid return, this return visit would result in lost time at work and othercosts. They also claimed that a person signing the disclosure as the buyerand the seller did not create a situation ripe for fraud, that the provisionconflicted with State laws and was contrary to Federal law. Additionalinformation concerning these petitions is included in the denial of petitionsfor reconsideration published in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4>The petitioners asked that NHTSA eliminate section 580.5(h). Alternatively,the petitioners suggested that NHTSA permit the use of a special powerof attorney or require title sets, a two-part title system where the ownerholds the title and the lienholder holds a notice of security interestfiling.<ITAG tagnum="84">Congressional Mandate</ITAG>Before the agency could fully consider these petitions, Congress enactedthe Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act, Pub. L. 100-561. Section 401 ofthe Act, which amends section 408(d)(1) of the Motor Vehicle Informationand Cost Savings Act, 15 U.S.C. 1988(d)(1), concerns the use of limitedpowers of attorney in connection with mileage disclosure. The purpose ofthis provision is to resolve a technical problem for purchaser: of usedmotor vehicles (dealers), without increasing the burden on States or lesseningour ability to fight odometer fraud. 134 Cong. Rec. H10079 (daily ed. October12, 1988) (remarks of Rep. Whittaker). Congress determined that NHTSA'sAugust 1988 final rule, which prohibits a person from signing an odometerdisclosure statement as both the transferor and transferee in the sametransaction, could have the effect of precluding the use of a power ofattorney in certain instances. Recognizing that the Truth in Mileage Actof 1986 requires a disclosure, including the transferee's signature, onthe title, Congress found that limiting the use of powers of attorney couldcause an undue burden on dealers and consumers when a consumer's titleis held by a bank or other lienholder. Because the consumer does not havethe vehicle's title in these instances, the consumer, as a transferor,would be unable to complete the disclosure on the title unless: (1) Theconsumer returned to the dealer after the dealer paid off the lien andreceived the title from the lienholder, or (2) the title was mailed bythe dealer to the consumer, completed by the consumer, and mailed backto the dealer. Both of these alternatives were rejected by Congress. ``Itis not reasonable to assume that the consumer will come back to the dealerseveral days or weeks later to fill in a title received from the bank bythe dealer after paying off the lien. It is also not safe to rely on themails to send the valuable title document to the consumer or to rely onthe consumer to return the document in a timely fashion.'' 134 Cong. Rec.H10079 (daily ed. October 12, 1988) (remarks of Rep. Dingell).To resolve the problem and alleviate potential costs for dealers and consumers,the new law specifies that a power of attorney authorizing the dealer todisclose mileage on the title on behalf of the consumer may be used whenthe transferor's title document is physically held by a lienholder, ifotherwise permitted by State law. The new law does not require the Statesto allow the use of a power of attorney for the purpose of mileage disclosure.However, if a State chooses to permit the use of powers of attorney inconnection with mileage disclosure, the State itself must issue the powerof attorney form, and the form must be consistent with the requirementsof the law and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The new law directsthe agency to prescribe the form and content of the power of attorney/disclosuredocument and reasonable conditions for its use by the transferor. Morespecifically, the new law requires that the form: (1) ``be issued by aState to transferees in accordance with paragraph (2)(A)(i) * * *'' (Paragrpah(2)(A)(i) concerns the issuance of documents that are set forth by a secureprinting process or other secure process.); (2) include an odometer disclosurestatement and other information as NHTSA deems necessary; and (3) be submittedto the State by the person granted the power of attorney. It also requiresNHTSA to provide for the retention of a copy of the power of attorney formand to ensure that the person granted the power of attorney completes thedisclosure on the title consistent with the disclosure on the power ofattorney form.We note that in some States, a secure power of attorney is not necessaryto ensure that the mileage disclosure of the customer trading in a vehicleto a dealer is included on the vehicle's title document. For example, someStates record all lien information on computerized recordkeeping systemsand allow the registered owner to hold the title document. Other Stateshave adopted a two-part title system under which the registered owner holdsthe title document and the lienholder holds a notice of security interestfiling. Under either system, because the vehicle owner would have the titledocument, he could make the disclosure on the title and would not needto use a power of attorney form. In these States, the provisions of thenew law would not apply, and the disclosure signed by the transferor wouldcontinue to be required on the vehicle's title document.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interim Final Rule</ITAG>This notice is published as an interim final rule, without prior noticeand opportunity to comment. NHTSA believes that there is good cause forfinding that notice and comment rulemaking is impracticable, unnecessary,and contrary to the public interest in this instance, since it would preventcompliance with the February 1, 1989 statutory deadline for issuance ofa final rule. This finding is also based on the agency's view that giventhe April 29, 1989 effective date of NHTSA's August 1988 final rule whichcould result in an undue burden on dealers and consumers when a consumer'stitle is held by a bank or other lienholder, relief from the August 1988rule is imperative.As an interim final rule, this regulation is fully in effect and bindingafter its effective date, unless NHTSA issues a permanent final rule thirtydays prior to that time. No further regulatory action by NHTSA is essentialto the effectiveness of this rule. However, in order to benefit from commentswhich interested parties and the public may make, we are requesting thatcomments be submitted to the docket for this notice. All comments submittedin response to this notice will be considered by the agency. Followingthe close of the comment period, NHTSA will publish a notice respondingto the comments and, if appropriate, NHTSA will amend the provisions ofthis rule.Consistent with the provisions of the new law concerning the security ofthe power of attorney forms, this interim final rule revises andSection;580.4,which concerns the security of title documents. Although the legislativehistory indicates that the power of attorney forms must be ``no less securethan the title document itself'', 134 Cong. Rec. H10079 (daily ed. October12, 1988) (remarks of Rep. Dingell), we believe that we can satisfy ourstatutory obligation to require secure forms and avoid unnecessary financialburdens upon the States by including a provision that is consistent withour position on the security of reassignment documents. Since the August1988 final rule requires that reassignment documents be set forth by ``asecure process'', not necessarily the same process used to secure the title,this rule requires that the power of attorney forms also be set forth by``a secure process''. Accordingly, we are changing the title of andSection;580.4to read ``Security of titles documents and power of attorney forms'', andwe are amending that section to require that power of attorney forms issuedpursuant to andSection;580.13 and andSection;580.14 be set forth by a secureprocess.The new law does not give NHTSA explicit statutory authority to requirethe States to control the power of attorney forms by any type of numberingsystem. Therefore, we have not limited the administrative discretion ofthe States in this area even though we recognize that it is common practiceto control secure documents. This is also consistent with our positionconcerning reassignment documents. However, nothing in the Act or thisrule should be read to preclude a State from using control techniques onthese documents.Since section 401 of the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act has the effectof allowing a person to sign an odometer disclosure statement on the titleas both the transferor and the transferee in specified circumstances, weare amending andSection;580.5(h), which prohibits a person from signing anodometer disclosure statement as both the transferor and transferee inthe same transaction. This amendment to andSection;580.5(h) permits a personto sign an odometer disclosure statement as both the transferor and transfereeif the requirements of the new andSection;580.13 and andSection;580.14, whichNHTSA is adding below, have been met.In accordance with the Congressional mandate, we are adding a new andSection;580.13.Under this section, if permitted by State law, a transferor whose motorvehicle title document is physically held by a lienholder may give histransferee a power of attorney for the purpose of mileage disclosure onthe title document. The power of attorney must be on Part A of a secureform issued by the State and must contain a space for the transferor todisclose the mileage.The disclosure required to be made by the transferor to the transfereeon the power of attorney form parallels the disclosure required to be madeby the transferor to the transferee on the title and on a separate odometerdisclosure statement. While this rule sets forth the information whichmust be disclosed, we are adding, in Appendix E, a sample power of attorneyform that the States which elect to provide power of attorney forms mayadopt. The form must be separated into parts A, B, and C. However, eachState is free to organize, in each part, the information required by thisrule in any way it wishes.As required by the new law and to ensure the integrity of the paper trail,we are requiring the transferee exercising the power of attorney to restatethe mileage on the transferor's title exactly as it appears on the transferor'sdisclosure on the power of attorney form. In addition, this rule requiresthe transferee to submit the original power of attorney form to the Statewith an application for title and the transferor's title. This could beaccomplished at one of two times. The transferee could apply for titlein his own name and submit the secure power of attorney form and his transferor'stitle. Alternatively, the transferee could submit the secure power of attorneyform after selling the vehicle, with the title and his purchaser's titleapplication, provided his purchaser permits him to apply for title on behalfof the purchaser. As noted by Representative Clement, ``Limiting the useof the power of attorney to this ``first sale'' instance should assistauto dealers in completing the sales transaction while affording sufficientsafeguards against odometer fraud.'' 134 Cong. Rec. H10081 (daily ed. October12, 1988) (remarks of Rep. Clement). It would ensure that the State wouldbe able to compare the transferor's disclosure on the power of attorneyform with the transferee's disclosure, on behalf of the transferor, madeon the title pursuant to the power of attorney. If the transferee werenot required to submit the power of attorney to the State with the applicationfor title and the transferor's title, the integrity of the paper trailwould be at risk, because subsequent transferors could discard the powerof attorney, forge a new one, and alter the mileage on the title. (As notedabove, we recognize that even with securely printed titles, some alterationshave been, and may continue to be, undetected upon initial review by StateDepartments of Motor Vehicles.) Additionally, the paper trail would bein jeopardy if the transferee submitted only the power of attorney formand no title documents. This could result in the transfer of the vehicleto an out-of-state buyer. The title would be in one State and the securepower of attorney form in another; they could not be easily compared. Thiswould be similar to the problems with the current use of a separate odometerdisclosure statement. Therefore, we believe that this submission of theoriginal power of attorney form to the titling State is necessary to preventthe misuse of the forms and to facilitate enforcement of the anti-fraudprovisions of the law.As requested during the debate in the House of Representatives on the amendment,NHTSA has also considered other instances when a secure power of attorneymay be necessary so as not to alter or interfere with proper business transactions.We have considered whether to permit a transferee to give his power ofattorney to his transferor for the purpose of acknowledging the mileagedisclosure. For example, if the transferor is a dealer who does not havepossession of the title, because the vehicle was a trade-in and the lienholderhas not yet released title, should the buyer, the transferee, be permittedto give a power of attorney to the transferor/selling dealer to acknowledgethe mileage disclosure on his behalf? This power of attorney from the transfereeto the transferor would allow the tranferor to sign the title as both thetransferor and transferee in the same transaction. To alleviate any potentialcommercial or business problems that could result in costs to dealers whenthey have not yet received the title upon which they must make a mileagedisclosure, because the title is physically held by the lienholder of theperson who traded in a car to the dealer, we are adding a new andSection;580.14 that permits a transferee to give his power of attorney to his transferorfor the purpose of reviewing the title and any reassignment documents todetermine whether there are any mileage discrepancies and, if there areno mileage discrepancies, to sign the title, acknowledging the disclosure.This power of attorney must include a disclosure from the transferor tothe transferee that parallels the disclosure required to be made by thetransferor to the transferee on the title document and on the separateodometer disclosure statement. In addition, because this power of attorneywould allow the same person to sign the title as the transferor and transfereein the same transaction, the appointment of the transferor as the tansferee'sattorney-in-fact must be made on Part B of the same secure power of attorneyform, issued by a State, upon which the transferor was appointed the attorney-in-factby his transferor pursuant to andSection; 580.13. This will enable purchasersto examine the previously issued power of attorney for alterations, erasures,and other marks, and to learn the name of the prior owner without the additionalcost of a title search. This is the same information that purchasers wouldreceive if the title was not held by a lienholder since, under the Truthin Mileage Act of 1986, the transferor is required to disclose mileageon the vehicle's title, if the title contains a space for the disclosure.This rule requires that a transferee who is granted a power of attorneyfrom his transferor and who applies for title in his own name must showhis purchaser, upon his purchaser's request, a copy of the previous owner'stitle, including the odometer disclosure completed on behalf of the previousowner, and a copy of the power of attorney form completed by the previousowner. Similarly, if a purchaser decides not to appoint his transferoras his attorney-in-fact pursuant to andSection; 580.14, the transferor mustshow his purchaser a copy of the previous owner's title and a copy of thepower of attorney form completed by the previous owner.To ensure that a person who exercises a power of attorney, either underandSection; 580.13, alone, or under andSection;andSection; 580.13 and 580.14,is fully aware of his obligation and his liability for any action thatis inconsistent with the power of attorney, this interim final rule requires,under a new andSection; 580.15, that the person exercising a power of attorney,either under andSection; 580.13 or under andSection;andSection; 580.13 and 580.14,complete, on Part C of the secure power of attorney form issued by theState, a certification that he has received and reviewed the title andany reassignment documents and that there are no indications of mileagediscrepancies. Any mileage discrepancies void the powers of attorney. Aviolation of this section could result in fines and/or imprisonment.We have also considered other instances in which a secure power of attorneythat would allow a person to sign a disclosure as the transferor and transfereein the same transaction should be permitted. Some have suggested that asecure power of attorney should be permitted when a title is lost or misplaced.We have carefully balanced the potential convenience of permitting a powerof attorney in this circumstance against the serious potential for underminingthe law enforcement purposes of the law. (As we have explained above, aperson signing a mileage disclosure as both the transferor and transfereecreates a situation ripe for fraud when the person signing the disclosureis intent on rolling back the odometer.) On balance, we have concludedthat the possible increase in inconvenience does not outweigh the increasedopportunity for odometer fraud. Furthermore, we have not been made awareof any business or commercial problems associated with this conclusionthat would be comparable to the problems associated with titles physicallyheld by lienholders. Especially because lost or misplaced titles can bereplaced, and because we can limit the possible misuse of secure powerof attorney forms, we have not extended the use of these secure powersof attorneys to situations in which the transferor's title is lost or misplaced.NHTSA invites comments on other situations in which a secure power of attorneyform may be necessary and appropriate.Finally, section 401 of the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act requiresNHTSA to promulgate a regulation that provides for the retention of a copyof the power of attorney form. Therefore, we are amending andSection; 580.8which concerns odometer disclosure statement retention by adding a newparagraph (c). Under this new paragraph, motor vehicle dealers and distributorswho are granted a power of attorney by their transferor are required toretain, for five years, a photostat, carbon, or other facsimile copy ofeach power of attorney form that they receive. These documents must beretained at the primary place of business of the dealer or distributorin an order that is appropriate with business requirements and that permitssystematic retrieval. This new paragraph (c) is consistent with the retentionrequirements of the August 1988 final rule that is applicable to dealers,distributors, and lessors. Like that final rule, the storage provisionof this amendment is phrased broadly to include any media by which informationmay be stored, provided there is no loss of information.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Assessment</ITAG>Congress found that limiting the use of powers of attorney in connectionwith mileage disclosure could cause an undue burden on dealers and consumerswhen a consumer's title is physically held by a bank or other lienholder.To resolve the problem and alleviate potential costs for dealers and consumers,the new law specifies that a power of attorney may be used, if otherwisepermitted by State law. The law specifies that the form be securely printedand include a disclosure. This interim final rule does not impose any requirementsupon the States other than those imposed by the law. Nevertheless, thisaction has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that thisinterim final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications towarrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The States may decidenot to allow the use of powers of attorney in connection with mileage disclosureand, therefore, would not be required to print conforming forms.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impacts</ITAG>A. Costs and Benefits to Dealers, States, and ConsumersNHTSA has analyzed this rule and determined that it is neither ``major''within the meaning of Executive Order 12291, nor ``significant'' withinthe meaning of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies andprocedures. A regulatory evaluation of the impacts of this proposal hasbeen prepared and place in Docket 87-09, Notice 9. Any interested personmay obtain a copy of this regulatory analysis by writing to NHTSA DocketSection, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, or by calling theDocket Section at (202) 366-4949.B. Small Business ImpactsThe agency has also considered the impacts of this rule in relation tothe Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this rule will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.The net increase in annual operating costs resulting from this interimfinal rule would be an estimated $4.1 million for States and localitiesand an estimated $4.5 million to $6.6 million to dealers. We estimate thatthere are 75,000 dealers that would be effected by this rule. Therefore,the cost to each dealer would be approximately $60.00 to $80.00. Smallbusinesses (dealers) will need to spend the same time executing each formas will large businesses (dealers). It is not possible to minimize thisburden. However, since these small entities will make fewer sales thanlarge businesses, they will spend less time on these forms. Furthermore,while the States may charge dealers for these secure power of attorneyform, the estimated cost of these documents is only approximately fivecents per form. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has beenprepared. However, the agency invites comments from small businesses onthis issue.C. Environmental ImpactsNHTSA has considered the environmental implications of this rule, in accordancewith the National Environmental Policy Act, and determined that it willnot significantly affect the human environment. Accordingly, an environmentalimpact statement has not been prepared.D. Paperwork Reduction ActThe office of Management and Budget (OMB) has already approved NHTSA'sinformation collection requirements that require consumers, dealers, distributors,lessors, and auction companies to disclose and/or retain odometer disclosureinformation. (OMB andplusmin;2127-0047). This rule expands the scope of thoserequirements to include transferrors who authorize their transferee toexactly restate the mileage disclosure on the title as they have disclosedit on a power of attorney form issued by a State. It also expands the scopeof the requirements to include transferees who use a secure power of attorneyform to authorize their transferors to review the title for discrepanciesand acknowledge mileage disclosure on their behalf. Finally, this ruleexpands the scope of the information collection requirements to includedealers and distributors who retain a copy of the secure power of attorneyform. Therefore, these new requirements are also considered to be informationcollection requirements as that term is defined by OMB in 5 CFR Part 1520.Accordingly, this rule will be submitted to OMB for its approval pursuantto the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>Comments on these information collection requirementsshould be submitted to Office of Management and Budget, Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Office forNHTSA. It is requested that comments sent to OMB also be sent to the NHTSArulemaking docket for this proposed action.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this interim finalrule. It is requested, but not required, that ten copies be submitted.All comments must not exceed fifteen pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21).Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regardto the fifteen page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commentsto detail their preliminary arguments in a concise fashion.All comments received before the close of business on the comment closingdate listed above will be considered and will be available for examinationin the docket at the above address both before and after that date. Tothe extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also beconsidered. Following the close of the comment period, NHTSA will publisha notice responding to the comments and, if appropriate, NHTSA will amendthe provisions of this rule. Comments received too late for considerationwill be considered as suggestions for future rulemaking action. The agencywill continue to file relevant information as it becomes available. Itis recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket fornew material.Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments bythe docket should enclose a self-addressed, stamped postcard in the envelopewith their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisorwill return the postcard by mail.In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 580 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 580-[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
