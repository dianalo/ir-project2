The disclosure followed an announcement by National Business that an independent auditor was to review its financial statements for the year ended Sept. 30 in the wake of &quot;discussions&quot; with Ontario securities regulators. The company withdrew a planned $34.1 million stock buy-back offer last week, pending the audit.    National Business said Hees International Corp., a Toronto financial investment and management concern, agreed to provide services to the company.    Tim Casgrain, a managing partner with Hees, was named president and chief executive officer, replacing Clive Raymond. Paul Trennum, National Business vice president and chief financial officer, will also be replaced. Messrs. Raymond and Trennum couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Casgrain declined to elaborate on the possible unauthorized asset transfers. National Business said its committee of independent directors is satisfied the assets in question don't have &quot;a significant impact on the company's ability to carry on its business.&quot;    National Business' stock buy-back offer was to have been made Thursday through the Toronto Stock Exchange. Trading in the company's stock was halted the same day and hasn't resumed. National Business closed Wednesday at 12.25 dollars, down 37.5 Canadian cents.    National Business, a supplier of plastic transaction cards and related services and equipment, has been the target of heavy short selling in the U.S. Short interest rose to 1.4 million shares from 852,400 in the month ended Jan. 15, according to the National Association of Securities Dealers. National Business had about 16.8 million shares outstanding on Sept. 30.    Analysts said some investors were selling short because of the company's increased debt, inventory and accounts receivable. As of Sept. 30, the company reported long-term debt of 112.2 million dollars, up from 10.1 million a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
