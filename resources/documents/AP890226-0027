Radio Kabul said Sunday that five civilians died Saturday in aguerrilla rocket attack on the eastern city of Jalalabad and thatanother civilian died in a similar attack in northeastern Laghmanprovince.   The guerrilla-controlled Afghan News Agency said 68 Afghansoldiers were killed and about 90 wounded in fighting aroundAfghanistan since Tuesday.   And the Soviet news agency Tass said Afghan soldiers killed 97guerrillas and captured two major ammunition depots in fightingSaturday.   Tass said the Afghan Foreign Ministry issued a statementcriticizing the Moslem guerrillas for forming a government-in-exilein Pakistan, where they are based, and for predicting they will soontake power in Afghanistan.   The statement, the first official Afghan reaction to the interimgovernment, said it violated the U.N.-mediated accord that led theSoviet Union to withdraw its 115,000 troops from Afghanistan.   Tass also quoted the Soviet newspaper Izvestia as saying theguerrillas plan to attack Kabul in a bid to topple the Moscow-backedregime of President Najib. It said they also plan to attackJalalabad and hope to install their government there.   None of the reports could be confirmed independently.   If the Afghan military defections are confirmed, they would bethe largest reported in the war between the U.S.-backed guerrillasand the communist regime in Kabul. The Afghan army is estimated tohave 50,000 soldiers.   A spokesman for the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla group said Sundaythat three Afghan regiments, or more than 10,000 men, defected tothe insurgents in northern Takhar and Badakhshan provinces on Feb.16, the day after Soviet troops ended nine years of militaryinvolvement in Afghanistan.   The Afghan soldiers surrendered 10,000 weapons and 90 militaryvehicles, spokesman Mohammad Shoaib said from his headquarters inPeshawar.   Ismail Khan, a Jamiat field commander, claimed 600 Afghansoldiers defected Feb. 18 from the garrison town of Rubat Sangi nearHerat, the western provincial capital. Statements by Jamiat, one ofthe most powerful rebel military groups, have generally provedreliable.   The Afghan News Agency of the rival Hezb-i-Islami rebel groupsaid another 101 government soldiers surrendured during a guerrillaattack Wednesday near Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of northern Balkhprovince.   Earlier this month, a council of Afghan guerrilla leaders met inPakistan and formed a government-in-exile. They called on foreigncountries to recognize the proposed government, which hopes to takeover if Kabul is overthrown.   Tass quoted the Afghan Foreign Ministry as saying the interimgovernment was formed ``under the direct pressure of Pakistanisecret services and their imperialist patrons in violation of theU.N. charter.''   Tass said the ministry ``described this move as an interferencein domestic affairs of the sovereign and non-aligned state.''   Afghanistan's major cities are under siege by the guerrillas, whoreportedly control 90 percent of the countryside.   Guerrilla field commanders have said they oppose major offensiveson urban areas that would result in high civilian casualties.</TEXT></DOC>
