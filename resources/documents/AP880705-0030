The 13th party congress is seen as a watershed in Taiwan'spolitical development. Government initiative has virtually haltedpending its outcome.   ``Everything has stopped except the pollution and the traffic,''leading political journalist Antonio Chiang joked in a recentinterview.   The congress will differ greatly from past gatherings dominatedby strongmen from the Chiang Kai-shek family, whose unquestionedsupremacy in the Nationalist Party dates back six decades.   The last congress, seven years ago, was run by the latePresident Chiang Ching-kuo, eldest son of the World War II leader.   Though Chiang Ching-kuo died in January, his legacy will be verymuch alive at the congress as delegates consider how fast and howfar to go with the political and social change he began.   In his final years, Chiang ended 38 years of martial law,allowed the formation of opposition parties and opened the door tounofficial contact with arch-enemy China. Many media taboos thatprevented critical reporting of government leaders and policiesalso have disappeared.   Taiwanese have staged more than 1,500 demonstrations in the pastyear, most of them peaceful, to protest a wide variety ofgovernment policies. The number of protests has declined, however,since police cracked down on a May 20 riot and detained nearly 100people.   Some observers believe the protests indicate that expectationsfor change have increased and social unrest could result if theNationalists do not maintain a quick pace of liberalization.   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party wants to scrap thepolitical system that ensures the Legislature and electoral collegeremain controlled by aging Nationalists who do not face elections.The government has promised to open more seats to elections, buthas yet to announce details.   Many Taiwanese also want changes in economic and financialpolicies they claim favor big business.   The congress is expected to retire some old-guard partyconservatives from the Nationalist leadership clique that fled toTaiwan in 1949 with Chiang Kai-shek after losing a civil war to theCommunists on the Chinese mainland.   ``The whole power structure will be much younger,'' predictedChang Chung-tung, professor of history at the National TaiwanUniversity.   Elderly Nationalists from the Chinese mainland still dominatethe party's 31-member policy-making Central Standing Committee, butas many as half are expected to step down.   Native Taiwanese, who comprise about 85 percent of the island'snearly 20 million people, hold about one-third of committee seats,but that proportion should increase.   The new committee could determine how much leeway President LeeTeng-hui, the first Taiwan-born leader of the Nationalistgovernment, will have to push forward his own programs for change.   Lee, 65, who was named acting party chairman two weeks afterChiang's death, is expected to be confirmed chairman at thecongress.   The 2.4 million-member Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, wasfounded on mainland China in 1894 by Sun Yat-sen, regarded as thefather of modern China for his role in toppling the Manchu Qingdynasty in 1911.   Power in the Kuomintang, which in structure resembles theChinese Communist Party, traditionally has flowed from the topdown. The party was dominated first by Sun, then by Chiang Kai-shekand most recently by Chiang Ching-kuo.   This year's party congress not only lacks a strongmanpersonality but for the first time will include delegates nothandpicked by Nationalist officials.   Premier Yu Kuo-hwa and other top government officials, for thefirst time in their careers, have had to campaign across the islandto drum up support for their top-level positions.   In recent newspaper interviews, Yu vowed to push forprivatization of public banks and some state-run companies andpromised to recruit younger Cabinet members.   Expected to play a vocal role at the congress are the so-called``Young Turk'' legislators who won elections held in 1986 for theLegislative Yuan, Taiwan's lawmaking body.   Forty of the Taiwan-elected lawmakers issued a statement June 24urging the party to map out a ``positive and forward-looking''policy toward China and to adopt a ``realistic attitude to promotemore exchanges and contacts.''   They demanded the 1,209 voting congress delegates decide theparty's China policy instead of rubber-stamping a resolution handeddown by the Central Standing Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
