But a senior official said the rise in food imports will be keptslow, despite increased U.S. pressure on Japan to open up itsagricultural market.   Negotiations between U.S. and Japanese officials on access tolocal markets broke down last week after Japan refused to terminatestringent import quotas for beef and citrus fruits.   An earlier four-year agreement on U.S. food imports expiredMarch 30. Japan has maintained it only will increase its quotafigures, while the United States has demanded total liberalization.   U.S. officials say they will petition the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, an international forum that oversees trade rulesagreed upon by member nations, this week to convene a panel andhave the quota system deemed illegal under international tradingrules.   Soshichiro Nakagawa, director of the Research Division of theMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said Japan couldnot drop all food import quotas without causing widespreaddisruption. But he said the government expects to decrease itspresent beef self-sufficiency rate of 70 percent to between 55 and60 percent by 1995.   Because domestic beef supplies are growing slowly, most of theincreasing demand for beef must be accounted for by imports,Nakagawa said.   ``We will try to open our markets and improve access, but at thesame time try to strengthen the structure and constitution of thecompetitiveness of the Japanese agricultural industry,'' Nakagawatold reporters at a briefing on the agricultural white paper, orpolicy document.   While less than 10 percent of Japan's population is engaged infarming, farmers provide a strong backbone for the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party. Attempts to open up any section of theagricultural market traditionally have met with strong resistance.   The white paper said the government's first major task in comingyears will be to establish a self-supporting, highly productiveagricultural industry.   ``We are not saying that there should be self-sufficiency infood at any or all costs,'' Nakagawa said, but ``the first priorityor task is to make sure that there is a stable supply of food.''   The director said government will combine domestic productionwith ``an appropriate level of imports from overseas so that...foodsupply will be secured on a stable basis.''   Nakagawa also said the government will reduce its price supportsfor some products, such as eggs, because of the intense price warthat has sprung up between domestic and foreign foods because ofthe sharp appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar sinceSeptember 1985.   But he added the yen's upward swing would have slow impact onproducts from land-based farming, such as rice.   ``Therefore some price gap (between domestic and imported foods)would have to remain and we must gain the understanding andconvince the public that the gap is inevitable,'' Nakagawa said.``And to the extent that some gaps remain, some protective measureswill have to be kept in place for such commodities as rice andbeef.''   Nakagawa declined to comment on how Japan would react if GATTruled against the import quotas that are under fire from the UnitedStates. The trade body ordered Japan in February to lift importcurbs on 10 types of farm products to get into line withinternational rules, following a 1987 probe sparked by an Americancomplaint.   While Japan accepted the ruling on eight of the products, itrefused to lift curbs on starch and dairy products and to date hasnot stated any clear measures on eliminating the import barriers onthe eight products, which include tomato ketchup, glucose andcaramel.   But Nakagawa said Japan was obligated to implement the findingsof the report and will ``have to work with the United States to mapout the specifics and substance of what should be done.''</TEXT></DOC>
