Researchers expect the protein to be introduced for someleukemia patients this fall and for transplant patients in about ayear. The leukemia patients suffer from a form of the diseasemarked by an excess of the transplant-attacking blood cells.   ``There's no question that if everything works out the way we'dlike it to, it will be a whole new way'' of treating transplantpatients and victims of certain immune diseases, said Dr. RobertKirkman, a transplant surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital inBoston.   Kirkman said Tuesday at the annual meeting of the AmericanSociety of Transplant Physicians that the new fusion protein hassucceeded in prolonging the lives of mice after hearttransplantation. Nine of the 10 mice in the experiment appeared toretain their new hearts permanently without need for continualtherapy.   Dr. Lawrence G. Hunsicker, the society's president, hailed thefusion protein as ``terribly important.''   ``The hope is that you could get someone who needs a kidneytransplant and put in whatever one you have available,'' Hunsickersaid. ``Maybe (tissue) matching at that point wouldn't make adifference.''   Researchers have been working for nearly a decade on the newprotein, a fusion of a portion of the diphtheria toxin, one of thedeadliest known toxins, and the natural immune system proteininterleukin-2.   When the body's immune system is confronted with unfamiliarmaterial such as bacteria or a transplanted organ, it fights backwith a group of cells called T-cells.   The foreign substances activate a small number of T-cells, whichproduce interleukin-2 receptors, points on the cell surface towhich only interleukin-2 molecules will stick.   Activation of these receptors leads to an immunological cascadethat stimulates more harmful cells that then attack thetransplanted organ, leading to rejection of the foreign tissue.   To prevent this from happening, Murphy and Dr. Terry Strom,director of clinical immunology at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital,isolated the part of the diphtheria toxin that binds it to othercells and replaced it with the binding portion of the interleukin-2molecule.   The result was a hybrid protein that seeks out and attaches toonly those T-cells harmful to transplanted organs, and kills theT-cells with the toxin.   ``This therapy only zaps the cells that are active (against thetransplanted organ) at that time and doesn't depress the(disease-fighting) immune system across the board,'' Strom said.   Cyclosporine, a popular anti-rejection drug, suppresses thebody's entire immune system and, therefore, enhances the risk ofinfection. Side effects include kidney failure, excessive hairgrowth and tremors. Cyclosporine also costs transplant patients$5,000 a year or more.   And doctors at the University of Iowa are reporting an increasein malignant tumors in transplant patients receiving cyclosporinealong with steroids and another drug, azathioprine. The so-calledtriple drug therapy is suspected of being responsible for thecancer, although there is no hard evidence so far.   It is likely the fusion protein would be used with cyclosporinein humans, pending Food and Drug Administration approval, Stromsaid.   ``So maybe a little bit of cyclosporine will go a long way withthis toxin,'' he said.   Researchers said the fusion protein eventually may be used totreat autoimmune diseases, in which the body produces a disorderedimmunological response against itself. Such diseases include formsof diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.   Also at Tuesday's meeting, Robert H. Rubin, chief of infectiousdisease for transplantation at Massachusetts General Hospital,warned doctors they may be doing more harm than good by putting newkidneys into dialysis patients infected with AIDS.   About 250 people currently are on dialysis who test positive forthe AIDS virus but exhibit no symptoms of the disease, Rubin said.   ``Nobody wants to turn their backs on these people,'' he said.But preliminary data suggest ``these folks do not do as well asother folks following transplantation.''</TEXT></DOC>
