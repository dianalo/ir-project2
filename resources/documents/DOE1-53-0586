From the economic standpoint, biotechnologies are better suitedfor the production of high value-added substances than heavy-tonnageproducts. Products undergoing extensive development are enzymes, aminoacids, biopolymers, etc. For heavier-tonnage products, biotechnologicalroutes come up against economic realities, and in particular againstthe comparative prices of oil and grain or sugar.</TEXT></DOC>
