This regulation requires the DEQE to determine and imposeRACT on all facilities with potential to emit one hundred tons per year(TPY) or more of VOC that are not already subject to Massachusetts' regulationsdeveloped pursuant to the EPA Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) documents.In a November 17, 1982 letter to EPA, the DEQE committed to submit eachof the individual RACT determinations to EPA as source-specific SIP revisions.On November 9, 1983, EPA codified at 40 CFR 52.1123(b) that DEQE must submiteach RACT determination made under 310 CMR 7.18(17) to EPA as a SIP revisionin order to incorporate the limitations into the SIP. EPA's rationale forrequiring DEQE to submit each RACT determination as a single-source SIPrevision is that emission limits and reduction measures imposed by stateson existing stationary sources in nonattainment areas do not constituteRACT until and unless EPA approves them as RACT via rulemaking.On February 4, 1988 and February 29, 1988, the Massachusetts Departmentof Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) submitted a SIP revision forparallel processing. This revision is composed of two Massachusetts planapprovals dated March 21, 1975 and February 29, 1988 (CM-74-IF-025 andCR-88-IF-002) which define VOC control requirements for Cranston PrintWorks Company, Webster Division Facility (Cranston) located in Webster,Massachusetts. Cranston is a fabric printing company. It is not subjectto either the Massachusetts' fabric coating regulation (which applies tofacilities which administer a uniform layer of coating across the entirewidth of the substrate) or to the Massachusetts' graphic arts regulation(which applies to flexographic printing facilities and packaging and publicationrotogravure printing facilities). Therefore, Cranston is subject to 310CMR 7.18(17), ``Reasonably Available Control Technology,'' as a non-CTGsource with the potential to emit 100 TPY or more of VOCs.Cranston prints fabrics which are used primarily in the high-fashion apparelindustry. Its VOC emissions result from two processes, the acid ager processand the fabric printing process. The acid ager process treats the fabric.The fabric printing process employs six roller and three rotary screenprinting machines. The source of VOC emissions from this process is themineral spirits print paste used on its roller printers. Cranston uses9 print pastes; only one contains mineral spirits. The majority of VOCsare emitted when the printed fabric is dried on steam dry cans. A descriptionof Cranston's non-CTG processes, DEQE's plan approvals, and the amendmentsnecessary to secure final EPA approval of those plan approvals is providedbelow.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Acid Ager Process</ITAG>A scrubber controls the VOC emissions (acetic acid) from the acid agerline. The scrubber controls VOC emissions to 0.6 lb/hr at an overall efficiencyof 99%. The scrubber reduces VOC emissions from 260 tons per year (TPY)2.6 TPY. The waste-water stream from the scrubber is neutralized priorto discharge by mixing it with other on-site waste streams that are basic.The DEQE issued Cranston a plan approval on March 21, 1975 (andplusmin;CM-74-IF-025)requiring that it operate the acid ager line with a scrubber. The DEQEspecifically determined RACT for the acid ager line as a scrubber with99% overall efficiency as required by the March 21, 1975 plan approval.In addition, the DEQE has imposed daily recordkeeping and compliance testingrequirements for this line in a February 29, 1988 RACT plan approval (andplusmin;CR-88-IF-002)which was also issued to Cranston pursuant to 310 CMR 7.18(17).EPA has reviewed the two plan approvals and supporting documentation whichwere submitted as a SIP revision for parallel processing. EPA generallyconcurs with the DEQE's RACT determination for the acid ager process. Theproposed plan approvals must however be amended, as explained below, toinclude additional recordkeeping, monitoring, and other enforceable provisionsnecessary to ensure that the RACT requirements will be enforceable as apractical matter prior to being formally submitted as SIP revisions bythe DEQE. These amendments must be made in order for EPA to take finalaction to approve the plan approvals as a revision to the SIP.Amendments to Plan Approvals for the Acid Ager ProcessThe DEQE must make the following revisions to the March 21, 1975 plan approval(andplusmin;CM-74-IF-025) and to the February 29, 1988 plan approval (andplusmin;CR-88-IF-002)for the acid ager process:1. The March 21, 1975 plan approval must require that Cranston maintainan overall scrubber efficiency greater than or equal to 99% at all times.2. The March 21, 1975 plan approval must specifically require that theacid ager emissions shall not exceed 0.6 lb/hr.3. The March 21, 1975 plan approval must contain additional operating limitations,monitoring provisions, and recordkeeping requirements to indicate whetherthe 99% efficiency is being maintained.Specifically, the plan approval should contain a minimum water inlet flowrate, a maximum operating temperature of the air inlet, and a maximum wetair flow rate derived either from a compliance test which demonstratedcompliance with the 99% efficiency or, if compliance test results are notavailable, from the scrubber design. In addition, the plan approval mustspecify a maximum pressure drop across the scrubber which is based on thecompliance test or scrubber design. The plan approval must require Cranstonto monitor and record the pressure drop once per day. Further, the planapproval must require that Cranston continuously monitor and record thetemperature of the air inlet, the inlet air flow rate, and the inlet waterflow rate to confirm that the 99% efficiency is being met. The plan approvalalso must contain a contingency plan for when monitored parameters arenot maintained at the values specified in the plan approval.4. As an alternative to No. 3 above, the March 21, 1975 plan approval couldrequire Cranston to continuously monitor with some hydrocarbon detectiondevice and record the amount of VOC in the inlet and outlet gas to confirmthat the 99% efficiency is being met.5. The DEQE must formally submit an approvable revision to the SIP's VOCtest method regulation requiring non-CTG sources subject to 310 CMR 7.18(17)to use EPA-approved test methods, or specify the use of EPA-approved testmethods in both the March 21, 1975 plan approval (andplusmin;CM-74-IF-025)and the February 29, 1988 plan approval (andplusmin;CR-88-IF-002).In addition, the DEQE did not provide the opportunity for public commenton the March 21, 1975 plan approval. The DEQE must publish a public noticeand hold a public hearing on this plan approval, or certify that its requirementsare a ``reasonable outgrowth'' of the RACT proposal in the plan approvalthat went to public hearing on October 7, 1986.For further details on these requirements refer to the Technical SupportDocument prepared for this revision which may be obtained from the EPARegional Office listed in the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Fabric Printing Process</ITAG>Cranston has reduced VOC emissions (mineral spirits) from its fabric printingoperations by reformulating one of its print pastes, changing productionschedules, and by replacing roller printers with screen printers. Cranstonhas reduced its actual annual VOC emissions from fabric printing operationsfrom 819 TPY in 1980 to 412 TPY in 1987. This is a 50% annual reduction.The DEQE issued the fabric printing operations a plan approval on February29, 1988 (andplusmin;CR88-IF-002) which imposes a short term emission rateof 82.5 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed (averaged over 24 hours) and an annualemissions cap of 412 TPY. This plan approval also imposes daily recordkeeping,quarterly reporting, and compliance testing requirements for the fabricprinting process. The DEQE has determined that a 50% annual reduction inVOC emissions from Cranston's fabric printing operations is RACT for thisprocess.EPA has reviewed the February 29, 1988 plan approval and supporting documentationwhich DEQE submitted as a SIP revision for parallel processing and hasconcluded that further documentation, as detailed below, is necessary tosupport the emission rate of 82.5 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed (averagedover 24 hours) as RACT for the fabric printing process. Cranston's emissionrate in 1980 was 89.8 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed. The emission rateincluded in the plan approval is 82.5 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed (averagedover 24 hours). This is only an 8% reduction in VOC emissions on a dailybasis.EPA considers fabric printing similar to graphic arts printing becauseboth processes print substrates using engraved intaglio rollers. Therefore,the DEQE must clearly document, in the SIP submittal, why Cranston cannotachieve a 65% reduction with add-on control technology, or cannot use printpastes with equivalent formulations as those set forth in Massachusetts'Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(12) which was developed in accordance with EPA'sgraphic arts CTG (EPA-450/2-78-033). For EPA to approve this SIP revision,the DEQE must submit the following additional documentation to supportthat 82.5 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed (averaged over 24 hours) is RACT:1. Why Cranston cannot achieve a 65% overall reduction with add-on controltechnology as in the Massachusetts Graphic Arts Regulation. Specifically,why add-on controls are not technically or economically feasible for eachline. Documentation must include cost analyses and technical documentationfor carbon adsorption, incineration (catalytic and thermal), and ductingemissions to existing boilers. Further, the DEQE's documentation must includewhy Cranston cannot duct the exit gas of each line to add-on control equipment,and why Cranston cannot adjust the existing ventilation system to accommodateadd-on controls.2. Why Cranston cannot use print pastes with equivalent formulations asthose set forth in the Massachusetts Graphic Arts Regulation. Specifically,why Cranston cannot achieve a higher percent reduction via reformulationor switching to screen printing.In addition, it is not clear whether the 82.5 lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed(as averaged over 24 hours) emission limit is being met on a line-by-lineor via cross-line averaging. If Cranston is achieving compliance with thisemission limit via cross-line averaging, then the plan approval must requirethat Cranston meet all of the requirements of EPA's Emissions Trading Policypublished on December 4, 1986 (51 FR 43814).Finally, DEQE must amend the February 29, 1988 plan approval itself, assummarized below, to include additional testing, enforceable emission ratesand other provisions to ensure that the limitations are enforceable priorto being formally submitted as a SIP revision by the DEQE. These amendmentsmust be made in order for EPA to take final action and incorporate theplan approval into the SIP.Amendments to the Plan Approval for the Fabric Printing ProcessThe DEQE must make the following revisions to the February 29, 1988 planapproval (andplusmin;CR-88-IF-002) for the fabric printing process:1. DEQE must first submit adequate documentation to justify that the 82.5lb VOC/1000 lb fabric printed (averaged over 24 hours) is RACT. If thislimit is being met by cross-line averaging, then the DEQE must amend theplan approval to require Cranston to comply with EPA's Emissions TradingPolicy.2. The DEQE must formally submit an approvable revision to the SIP's VOCtest method regulation requiring non-CTG sources subject to 310 CMR 7.18(17)to use EPA-approved test methods, or specify the use of EPA-approved testmethods in the plan approval.3. The plan approval must require Cranston to record the density of themineral spirits on a daily basis. Alternatively, the plan approval couldrequire that Cranston make this information readily accessible with theVOC records.For further details on these requirements refer to the Technical SupportDocument prepared for this revision which may be obtained from the EPARegional Office listed in the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this notice.EPA is proposing to approve two Massachusetts plan approvals as a revisionto the SIP provided that Massachusetts makes the changes described in thisnotice, and is soliciting public comments. These comments will be consideredbefore taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the FederalRulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the Region I officelisted in the addresses section of this notice. In addition, prior to finalrulemaking, EPA is requiring that the DEQE submit additional documentationto support the proposed RACT determination for the fabric printing process.EPA will provide the opportunity for comment on the additional documentationsubmitted by the DEQE prior to final approval of this revision.This revision is being processed under a procedure called ``parallel processing''(47 FR 27073). If the proposed revision is substantially changed, in areasother than required by this notice, EPA will evaluate those changes andmay publish another notice of proposed rulemaking. If no substantial changeswere made to the proposed revision, EPA will publish a final rulemakingnotice. The final rulemaking action by EPA will occur only after the finalplan approvals for Cranston have been issued by the DEQE and have beenformally submitted to EPA for incorporation into the SIP.<T3>Proposed Action:</T3> EPA is proposing to approve the MassachusettsPlan Approvals dated March 21, 1988 and February 29, 1988 (andplusmin;CM-74-IF-025and andplusmin;CR-88-IF-002) imposing RACT on Cranston Print Works Companyas a revision to the Massachusetts SIP. EPA is proposing approval withthe understanding that the DEQE will revise the plan approvals and submitadditional documentation as outlined in this notice prior to formal submittalof the plan approvals for incorporation into the SIP. If the DEQE's formalSIP revision request does not incorporate the requirements outlined inthis notice, EPA will withdraw this proposed action and take action todisapprove DEQE's SIP revision request.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (see46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the plan revisionwill be based on whether it meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A)_(K)and 110(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in40 CFR Part 51.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7404-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: September 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Michael R.
