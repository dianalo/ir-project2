The Khmer Rouge, blamed for killing hundreds of thousands ofCambodians during its 1975-78 reign, is one of three guerrillagroups opposing Cambodia's Vietnam-backed government.   Sihanouk was reported as saying that he was told by KhieuSamphan, the Khmer Rouge's nominal leader, that the group woulddissolve. The secretive Khmer Rouge has not previously clearlyspelled out its position.   Vietnam has said it will pull its estimated 140,000 troops outof Cambodia by 1990 and has begun withdrawing 50,000 troops in anoperation to be completed in December.   ``Previously, Khieu Samphan said the Phnom Penh regime should bedissolved but not his,'' the prince was reported as saying during avisit to his base on the Thai-Cambodian border on June 29. ``Twodays ago he came to see me and said he agreed that the two regimesshould be dissolved.''   Resistance radio carried Sihanouk's address at the Site Brefugee camp, and a text was obtained Sunday from a Western embassyin Bangkok.   During its rule, the Khmer Rouge regime of Prime Minister PolPot set up a vast network of slave labor camps and executionchambers and attempted to set up a harsh communist society.   After Vietnamese forces invaded and ousted the regime, the KhmerRouge joined Sihanouk and a third resistance group to form ananti-Vietnamese guerrilla coalition.   Wide agreement that the Khmer Rouge must not return to power wasreached at annual talks this past week between foreign ministers ofthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations and their counterpartsof Western countries and Japan.   After a Vietnamese withdrawal, the solution most widely acceptedby these countries is formation of a coalition government headed bySihanouk and including the Khmer Rouge, the pro-Vietnamese regimeof Prime Minister Hun Sen, and Son Sann's Khmer People's NationalLiberation Front. This coalition would oversee general elections.   Hun Sen has rejected dissolution of his regime, however, andinsisted that the guerrilla groups join his government.   According to the text of his remarks, Sihanouk said he toldKhieu Samphan that even after the Sihanouk party won the elections,``we will still call on the other three sides to join us in aquadripartite government forever to ensure our unity, security,national union.''   ``This is what I said to Khieu Samphan, who replied: `Thank you,Thank you,''' Sihanouk said.   The prince repeated, however, that after a Vietnamese pullout,an international peacekeeping force must stay in Cambodia for atleast five years ``so that the Khmer Rouge cannot maltreat us.''</TEXT></DOC>
