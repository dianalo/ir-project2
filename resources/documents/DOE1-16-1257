<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-16-1257 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors have isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding the human {beta}3&quot;-adrenergicreceptor. The deduced amino acid sequence (413 residues) is that of aprotein containing seven clusters of hydrophobic amino acids suggestiveof membrane-spanning domains. While the protein is 87% identical overallwith the previously cloned hamster {beta}3&quot;-adrenergic receptor, themost highly conserved regions are the putative transmembrane helices(95% identical) and cytoplasmic loops (93% identical), suggesting thatthese regions of the molecule harbor important functional domains. Severalof the transmembrane helices also share lesser degrees of identity withcomparable regions of select members of the opsin family of visual pigments.They have localized the gene for the {beta}3&quot;-adrenergic receptor toq31-q32 on chromosome 5. This is the same position recently determinedfor the gene encoding the receptor for platelet-derived growth factorand is adjacent to that for the FMS protooncogene, which encodes thereceptor for the macrophage colony-stimulating factor.</TEXT></DOC>
