(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Its decaying store fronts, tar-paper roofsand rusty railroad tracks suggest Bolton is just another town timeforgot.   But each day, a sign of how much times have changed appears whena tall, slender black man drives up to city hall. The street isnamed after Martin Luther King Jr., and the man is the mayor.   Lawrence Butler, a man once barred from the ballot box, nowpresides over this ragged rural hamlet some call a model of blackpolitical progress in America.   No blacks were allowed to vote in Bolton municipal electionsuntil 1969. Today, its mayor and four of five council members areblack. Change, indeed, but Butler says blacks still haven't reachedthe mountaintop.   ``I know we ain't where we used to be,'' he said. ``Lord, weain't where we ought to be. Sometimes, I question myself, where arewe?''   In the 15 years since it elected its first black mayor, Bolton,population 650, has built a new city hall and community center,paved streets, built houses, bought land for an industrial park andacquired an ambulance and fire and garbage trucks.   ``What Bolton represents since it got black leadership iscertainly progress, for blacks, even for whites,'' said LindaWilliams, senior political analyst at the Joint Center forPolitical Studies in Washington.   Bolton is a prime example of ``how blacks deprived in asegregated system ... can take political power, turn a town aroundand make it more responsive to the needs of black citizens,'' saidattorney Frank Parker.   Parker spearheaded many legal fights on behalf of elected blacksseeking to take office in Bolton. Courts and judges intervened,federal pollwatchers came to town and death threats were madebefore it all came about.   Hundreds of other communities in all corners of the UnitedStates have made white-to-black political transitions in the 20years since King's assassination. Some of the biggest change hascome in the South, home to more than half of the U.S. blackpopulation.   Blacks are running towns they marched through in the '60s,fighting for the right to vote. The number of Southern blackelected officials has increased by 55 times since 1965, Williamssaid.   Mississippi, where civil rights leader Medgar Evers was slain infront of his house, where riots erupted when James Meredith triedto enter college and the late Gov. Ross Barnett, surrounded by acadre of state troopers, turned him away, has 548 black electedofficials _ tops in the nation.   Mississippi has changed in many ways. Bolton is part of themetamorphosis.   ``The No. 1 progress is getting rid of the fear,'' said Butler,who picked cotton as a child and once picketed a whites-only poolwith a sign that urged, ``Don't blow your cool. Let us in thepool.''   ``Used to be you had a fear of somebody coming up to you and ...accusing you of anything,'' he said. ``You might have aconfrontation with a white and there was no such thing as winning.''   Butler never doubted blacks could manage Bolton. He just didn'tthink it would happen.   ``I figured whites would have died before they let us have theright to vote,'' he said. ``Some did. And blacks did, too.''   Black officeholders here, he said, have given folks ``a certainsense of pride and understanding. Blacks know there's somebody hereon a day-to-day basis fighting for them.''   Still, black leadership has not made poor people richer, or twosocieties one.   Butler estimates blacks' annual income in Bolton at about $4,500_ about a third that of whites. He said about 25 percent of blacksare jobless.   Although blacks and whites live together, they attend separatechurches and social functions, and white children attend privateschools.   ``I would love to paint you a peaches-and-cream story,'' saidBennie Thompson, the town's first black mayor, now a member of theHinds County Board of Supervisors.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
