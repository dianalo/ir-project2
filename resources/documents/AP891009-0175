On Nov. 15, about 82 million voters will be eligible to pick asuccessor to Jose Sarney, the first civilian president since amilitary coup in 1964 routed the left-leaning populist JoaoGoulart. Sarney took office as a result of a vote by an electoralcollege.   About 73 percent of the electorate _ Brazilians under the age of47 _ will be voting directly for a president for the first time intheir lives. Also for the first time, Brazilians as young as 16will be allowed to vote; about 3.3 million 16- and 17-year-oldshave registered but they are not required by law to vote as arethose 18 and over.   Brazil is seen by many here and abroad as a nation teetering onthe edge of economic, financial and social chaos and which way itgoes depends heavily on the outcome of the election.   ``There is a profound revolt against the political, economic andsocial system that hasn't been able to meet the people'sexpectations,'' said Helio Jaguaribe, director of the Institute ofPolitical and Social Studies in Rio de Janeiro.   ``This is the last chance for finding a rational solution. Ifthe next government cannot deal adequately with this built-upcrisis, the tendency is for the country to degenerate into chaosand hyperinflation and to become ungovernable.''   The last presidential election in 1960 saw the election of JanioQuadros, who served just eight months before resigning in August1961 and setting off a chain of events that led to the 1964military takeover.   Since that time, Brazil has become the Western world'seighth-largest economy. But its foreign debt has soared from $2billion to $110 billion _ the largest in the Third World. Itsannual inflation rate has soared to 1,200 percent and the minimumwage has eroded to the equivalent of $17.50 a week.   Many Brazilians are dissatisfied with Sarney, a 59-year-oldrancher and poet who has headed the civilian government since amilitary regime stepped aside in 1985.   His leadership is blamed for the soaring inflation andcorruption, which indisputably in Brazilian minds has hit almostevery level of his administration.   But popular resentment runs deeper.   ``The powerful sense of opposition in this election is not somuch against Sarney himself as against parties, politicians and thewhole political establishment,'' Jaguaribe said.   As a result, the candidates focus on change and cleangovernment. Issues such as how to repay the foreign debt havebecome secondary.   ``I want to rebuild this country stone by stone, brick bybrick,'' front-runner Fernando Collor de Mello said in a recentcampaign speech. Other candidates have made similar promises ingeneralized terms.   Twenty-two candidates are on the ballot.   Collor de Mello, former governor of the poor northeastern stateof Alagoas and one of Sarney's harshest critics, gained nationalattention by firing state employees with exorbitant salaries,popularly known as ``maharajas.'' Riding a new wave of popularity,he formed the center-right National Reconstruction Party in 1988and entered the presidential race.   ``I will get rid of the `maharajas' of the financial system andbuild a new Brazil without inflation, without maharajas and withoutcorruption,'' he told a recent rally.   However, Collor de Mello's standing in the polls skidded from 44percent in August to 34 percent in early October, after the presspublished charges of shady financial dealings and politicalcronyism in his own administration in Alagoas.   His closest challenger is Leonel Brizola of the center-leftDemocratic Labor Party, a former governor of Rio de Janeiro stateand a backer in the 1960s of Joao Goulart. Because of hisassociatons with Goulart, who is now dead, Brizola fled into exileafter the military coup but returned under a 1979 amnesty. He stillfaces opposition within the armed forces.   ``Brizola as president means change,'' he said in a campaignspeech. ``It will be the beginning of the end for the presenteconomic model of colonial capitalism, which was imposed by theright and, recently, shoved down our throats by the dictatorship.''   He scored 14 percent in October's polls.   Other major candidates:   _Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the Marxist-oriented WorkersParty: A congressman and former metalworkers union leader, he sayshe would redistribute land and wealth, proposes a suspension ofpayments on the foreign debt and calls for an audit of how theborrowed money was spent. A front-runner early on, the Octoberpolls gave him 9 percent of the vote.   _Paulo Maluf of the rightist Social Democratic Party: Amillionaire businessman and former governor of Sao Paulo, Malufpromises law-and-order and public works. He had the backing of themilitary in his unsuccessful contest in the electoral college votefor president in 1985. Polls gave him 8 percent of the vote.   _Guilherme Afif Domingos of the right-of-center Liberal Party: Awealthy businessman, banker and congressman from Sao Paulo, Afifpromotes an image as the enlightened pro-business candidate. Herose sharply in the October polls to 7 percent and gainednationwide media attention.   _Ulysses Guimaraes of the Brazilian Democratic Labor Party: Thespeaker of Brazil's House of Representatives under Sarney,Guimaraes for years led the opposition to the military regime. Buthis close association with Sarney has hurt his popularity. Thepolls gave him 4 percent.   _Roberto Freire of the Brazilian Communist Party: A congressmanfrom the northeastern sugar-growing state of Pernambuco, Freire isan admirer of the policies of Italy's Communist Party, the largestin the West. But his now-legal party still frightens large numbersof Brazilians. Polls in October gave him just 1 percent.   Because Brazil is so large, with population centers widelyscattered, television and radio are playing vital roles in thecampaign. The government has ordered all TV and radio stations tocarry twice-a-day, 70-minute shows devoted to the candidates andtheir campaigns.   About 100 million of Brazil's 145 million people have access totelevision and the candidates are concentrating heavily on thataudience.   The result so far has been mostly vague campaign promises: moreand better housing, schools, transportation and food production _with few candidates saying specifically how they would bring aboutsuch improvements.   Few candidates explain in any detail how they would deal withthe economy.   Collor de Mello says he would cut inflation by ending waste andby ``privatizing'' government property. But the only governmentproperty he has proposed selling are government mansions inBrasilia, the capital, now used rent-free by Cabinet ministers.   The new president is due to take office March 15 for a five-yearterm.   However, Sarney is under pressure to step down soon after theelection, following the example of neighboring Argentina. There,the outgoing President Raul Alfonsin, scheduled to leave office inDecember, handed the presidency to the Peronist Carlos Menem inJuly.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 15</NOTE></DOC>
