<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-0298 </DOCNO><TEXT>Because of the low Raman scattering probability and the short opticalpaths in films and interfaces, several techniques to enhance Raman signalshave been developed. Among these are interference enhancement in multilayerstructures, path length extension by wave guide methods, coherent nonlinearRaman spectroscopies, and resonant Raman enhancement by the use of shortwavelength excitation. We discuss the advantages and limitations of interferenceand resonance enhancement methods. A common theme of both methods isthe measurement of a Raman excitation profile spectrum by tuning theprobe laser wavelength across an optical interference passband or acrossthe electronic bandgap of the film material. Although interference isan optical effect which enhances the Raman spectrum uniformly, underresonance Raman conditions selective enhancement is observed for vibrationalmodes which are strongly coupled to the allowed electronic transitionsin the dielectric material. The principal limitation of resonance Ramanprobes of solid films is the optical damage threshold which is easilyexceeded by typical uv pulsed probe power levels near the electronicband edge. 10 refs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
