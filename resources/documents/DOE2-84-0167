In additionto the radioactive contamination of the environment, health effects dueto the exposure to ionizing radiation from the dispersed radioactivematerials are considered. Detrimental health effects have been studiedat two sites: Moerdijk and a fictitious reference site. No acute fatalitiesare expected. Less than 100 cases of acute non-fatal illnesses are expectedwhen countermeasures are taken into consideration, and averaging overall possible weather conditions. For specific weather conditions (appearing5% of the time) 0 to 1000 cases are expected, whereas for the remainingother weather conditions no cases of illness due to radiation are expected.When no countermeasures are taken, the average number of acute non-fatalillnesses is 2000. For late lethal effects (tumours) the individual riskis calculated as maximal 0.15% for those living within 15 km of the damagednuclear power plant, and maximal 0.05% for those living in the contaminatedarea beyond this region. For comparison: the general risk of death bycancer is more than 30% at present in the Netherlands. 50 refs.; 17 figs.;19 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
