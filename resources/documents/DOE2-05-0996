The ignitionrequirements of flammable gases and vapors are that their mixture concentrationis within the explosive limits (EL), and the mixtures have a sufficientenergy (ignition energy, IE) to be combustion-reacted. EL and IE changesdepending on the type of gases, temperature, pressure, and so on. Withinflammable gas increasingly added, the EL range is lessened, eventuallyto zero. The IE of a gas is smaller, as the ambient temperature lowers.Also, IE depends on the mixture concentration. When the pressure of agas mixture is remarkably reduced, the ignition becomes impossible. Thehumidity inhibits the ignition of a inflammable gas. The ignition offlammable gases, has a complicated mechanism containing the influencesof the size, the surface properties, and so on. The ignition dischargeradiates an energy higher than the minimum ignition energy. However,if the heat loss is remarkable, the ignition is impossible. For preventionof the ignition, it is effective to prevent flammable mixed gases frombeing produced, add uninflammable gases, ground conductive bodies, limitthe surface area of insulation bodies, remove electric charges, and soon. Also, humidifying, shielding charged bodies are available. (12 figs,5 tabs, 40 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
