Nationwide Life Insurance Company (``Nationwide'') is a stock life insurancecompany incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio and admitted todo business in all states and the District of Columbia. The NationwideVLI Separate Account-2 (``Separate Account'') is a separate investmentaccount of Nationwide, established under the laws of the State of Ohioand registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. It was establishedfor the purpose of funding flexible premium variable life insurance policies(``Policy or Policies'') issued by Nationwide. 2. The Policies will be distributed through Nationwide Financial Services,Inc. (``NFS''). NFS, a registered broker-dealer under the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934, is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers.The Policies will be sold by licensed insurance agents who are registeredrepresentatives of broker-dealers.3. The assets of the Separate Account will consist of shares of the NationwideSeparate Account Trust, Fidelity Variable Insurance Products Funds, AmericanLife/Annuity Series and Advisers Management Trust (``Funds'').4. The owner of a Policy pays a premium for life insurance coverage onthe person insured. The Policies may provide for a cash value which ispayable if a Policy is surrendered during the insured's lifetime. The deathbenefit and cash value of the Policies, however, may increase or decreaseto reflect the investment performance of the Separate Account sub-accountsto which premium is allocated. There is no guaranteed cash value.5. Upon issuance, a Policy will immediately provide for the payment oflife insurance proceeds in excess of any initial premium paid. Death benefitproceeds will exceed the Policy's cash value so long as the Policy remainsin force.6. A Policy owner may choose one of two death benefit options. Under Option1, the death benefit will be the greater of the specified amount or theapplicable percentage of the cash value. Under Option 2, the death benefitwill be the greater of the specified amount plus the cash value, or theapplicable percentage of cash value. The actual proceeds payable on theinsured's death will be the death benefit less any outstanding Policy loans,less any unpaid Policy charges.7. At the time of application, a Policy owner elects to have the cash valueallocated among one or more of the Separate Account sub-accounts. Suchelection is subject to any minimum contribution limitations which may beimposed by the Funds. Shares of the Funds, as specified by a Policy owner,are purchased at net asset value for the respective sub-accounts. No lessthan 10% of Cash Value may be allocated to any one sub-account.8. At the time a Policy is issued, its cash value is based on the NationwideSeparate Account Trust-Money Market Fund sub-account as if the Policy hadbeen issued and the premium invested on the date the premium was receivedin good order by Nationwide. When a Policy is issued, the cash value willbe held in the Nationwide Separate Account Trust-Money Market Fund sub-accountuntil the expiration of the period in which a Policy owner may exercisehis or her short term right to cancel the Policy. At the expiration ofthat period, the Cash Value will be allocated among the sub-accounts ofthe Separate Account in accordance with a Policy owner's instructions.On any date, the Cash Value of a Policy equals the Cash Value on the precedingvaluation date, plus any premium applied since the previous valuation date,plus or minus any investment results, and less any Policy charges.9. Nationwide makes a monthly deduction equal to the Policy AdministrationCharge, if any, plus the cost of insurance charge from the cash value ofeach Policy. The deductions are allocated among the sub-accounts of theSeparate Account in the same proportion that a Policy owner's cash valuein that sub-account bears to a Policy owner's total cash value, exclusiveof any Policy loan.10. A monthly Policy Administration Charge is deducted to reimburse Nationwidefor expenses related to the underwriting, issuance, and maintenance ofthe Policies. Currently, no Policy Administration Charge is deducted fromthe cash value for any Policy for which the total of premiums paid is $25,000or more. For Policies for which the total of premium payments made is lessthan $25,000, the current Policy Administration Charge is $10 per month;however, for all Policies, the Policy Administration Charge is guaranteednot to exceed $20 per month. Applicants represent that the Policy Administrationcharge is not discriminatory and will never be taken at a level in excessof Nationwide's actual cost in administering any Policy to which such chargeapplies. Applicants further represent that the current charge of $10 permonth on Policies for which the total of premium payments made is lessthan $25,000, will not subsidize the cost of administering Policies onwhich total premium payments exceed $25,000.11. A separate monthly cost of insurance is used to obtain the monthlycost of insurance for the insured's initial specified amount and for eachsubsequent increase in the specified amount. Each rate is based on theinsured's sex, attained age, and rate class. The rates for a standard rateclass will never be greater than the guaranteed maximum monthly cost ofinsurance rates, which are based on the 1958 Commissioner's Standard OrdinaryMortality Table, Age Last Birthday (``1958 CSO Mortality Table''), withappropriate increase for rate classes other than standard.12. Nationwide will deduct, on a daily basis, from the assets of the SeparateAccount, an amount equivalent on an annual basis to .95%, for the first10 policy years, and .50% thereafter, consisting of a mortality and expenserisk charge, a distribution expense charge, a premium tax recovery charge,and an income tax charge.13. The mortality risk assumed by Nationwide under the Policies is thatthe insured will not live as long as expected under the guaranteed 1958CSO Mortality Table. The expense risk assumed is that actual expenses incurredin issuing and administering the Policies will exceed the expenses assumedand charges assessed.14. Nationwide assumes risks associated with the non-recovery of expensesdue to the Policies which lapse or are surrendered during the first 10policy years. To compensate Nationwide for assuming these risks, a dailycharge is deducted from the assets of the sub-accounts of the SeparateAccount which is computed daily, and is equal on an annual basis to .50%of the assets of the Separate Account for all policy years.15. Nationwide pays any state premium taxes attributable to a particularPolicy when incurred by Nationwide. Nationwide expects to pay an averagestate tax rate of 2.5% of premium for all states. To reimburse Nationwidefor the payment of state premium taxes associated with the Policies, duringthe first 10 policy years, Nationwide deducts a daily charge computed ona daily basis from the assets of the sub-accounts, which is equal on anannual basis to .20% of the assets of the Separate Account during the first10 policy years and 0% thereafter. Applicants represent that premium taxcharges assessed will not exceed the actual cost of premium taxes paidand will not include any interest element.     16. Nationwide incurs sales and distribution expenses in marketing andissuing the Policies. Some of these expenses will be recovered from theDeferred Sales Charge on Policies surrendered during the first 9 policyyears. Nationwide will deduct a daily distribution Expense Charge fromthe assets of the sub-accounts of the Separate Account during the first10 policy years. This charge will be computed and deducted on a daily basis,and equal on an annual basis to .25% of the assets of the Separate Accountduring the first 10 policy years and 0% thereafter. 17. Nationwide does not currently assess any charge for income taxes incurredas a result of the operations of the Separate Account, but reserves theright to assess a charge for such taxes if Nationwide determines that suchtaxes may be incurred. 18. If a Policy is surrendered at any time during the first 9 policy years,a deferred sales charge will be assessed. For Policy years 10 and thereafter,no deferred sales charge will be assessed on surrender of the Policy. Inno event will the deferred sales charge exceed 8% of the initial premiumpaid; nor will the sum of any deferred sales charge actually deducted andthe cumulative total of the Distribution Expense Charge collected on anyPolicy exceed 9% of premiums paid for that policy. Cost of Insurance Charge: 19. Applicants seek relief from section 2(a)(35) and paragraphs (b)(1)(and (c)(4)(ii) of Rule 6e-3(T). 20. As indicated in representation 11 above, the maximum cost of insurancerates allowable under the Policies is based on the 1958 Commissioner'sStandard Ordinary Mortality Table (hereinafter ``1958 CSO Table''), eventhough the current cost of insurance rates for some insureds may be basedon the 1980 Commissioner's Standard Ordinary Table (hereinafter ``1980CSO Table''). Rates based on the 1958 CSO Table will be shown in the Tableof Guaranteed Maximum Insurance Rates contained in the Policy filed withthe insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which the Policies willbe offered. The current cost of insurance rates for some insureds may belower than or equal to the 1980 CSO Table rates based upon Nationwide'scurrent expectations of future experience. Rates may be increased in thefuture, up to the maximums permitted under the Policy, as determined byNationwide, based upon expectations of future experience. 21. Applicants request the above exemptions to the extent that paragraph(c)(4)(ii) prescribes that the amount excluded from sales load for costof insurance is limited to the ``cost of insurance for the period basedupon the 1980 Commissioner's Standard Ordinary Mortality Table and netinterest at the annual effective rate specified for purposes of paragraph(c)(8)(i)(B) of this Rule.'' Applicants seek an exemption to the extentnecessary to permit the exclusion of amounts for the actual cost of insurancecharges deducted under the Policy, which for standard underwriting riskclasses is guaranteed never to exceed amounts based on the 1958 CSO Table.22. Applicants believe that the regulation of cost of insurance rates moreappropriately rests with the jurisdiction of the state insurance departmentsof those states in which the Policies will be sold. Furthermore, priorto the adoption of Rule 6e-3(T), the Commission had not taken a positionthat the cost of insurance charges for variable life insurance productsmust be based on the 1980 CSO Table rather than the 1958 CSO Table. Inits original form, Rule 6e-2 permits companies to demonstrate compliancewith the sales load provisions of the 1940 Act by excluding from the definitionof ``sales load'' cost of insurance charges based on the 1958 CSO Table.However, in Rule 6e-3(T), the Commission took the position that the 1980CSO Table must be used for the same purposes. Subsequently, the Commissionamended Rule 6e-2 to permit cost of insurance rates to be based on eitherthe 1958 or 1980 CSO Table, depending on which table relates to the ratesguaranteed by the Policy. Applicants submit that the relief sought is identicalto relief sought and obtained by other companies now issuing variable lifeinsurance policies and is consistent with the position recently taken bythe Commission in its amendment of Rule 6e-2. <T3>Sales Load:</T3>23. Applicants seek relief from section 27(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and sections(b)(13)(i)(B) of Rule 6e-3(T). 24. Nationwide deducts no front-end sales load from premiums paid for thePolicies. The sole sources of recovery of sales and distribution expensesincurred are the assessment of a Distribution Expense Charge during thefirst 10 policy years and a Deferred Sales Charge against certain surrendersoccurring during the first 9 years after issuance of a Policy. The DeferredSales Charge, when applicable, is assessed as a percentage of the initialpremium paid, ranging from 8% in year 1, to 4% in year 9, and 0% thereafter.If additional premium payments are made, as permitted by the Policies,no Deferred Sales Charge attaches to such premium payments. The DistributionExpense Charge is equal on an annual basis to .25% of the assets of theSeparate Account, during the first 10 Policy years. 25. Applicants submit that the cumulative level of sales charges will bemonitored on a Policy basis so that the sum of the Deferred Sales Chargededucted on surrender and the cumulative Distribution Expense Charges collectedcan never exceed 9% of the total premiums paid, as provided in section27(a)(1) of the 1940 Act. Therefore, the total sales load under the Policieswill remain in full compliance with section 27(a)(1), and thus no exemptiverelief from that section appears needed. 26. Paragraph (b)(13)(i) of Rule 6e-3(T) affords automatic relief fromsection 27(a)(1), ``to the extent that sales load, as defined in paragraph(c)(4) of this Rule, deducted does not exceed that permitted by eithersubparagraph (A) or (B) below * * *'' Applicants made an election in theirS-6 registration statement, in a supplemental letter filed on September16, 1987, to rely on subparagraph (B), which limits sales load to ``9 percentum of payments made * * *'' Because of the reference in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)of the Rule to the 1980 CSO Table, for sales load computation purposes,Applicants are concerned that their use of the 1958 CSO Table, for certaininsureds, may make the Policies ineligible to rely on the automatic relieffrom section 27(a)(1) that is afforded by paragraph (b)(13)(i), if anysuch relief is needed at all. Applicants submit that, for purposes of salesload computation and compliance with paragraph (b)(13)(i)(B), as elected,Applicants should be permitted to utilize the mortality table guaranteedin the Policies, which fully complies with state insurance laws. Income Tax Charge:27. Applicants request an exemption from sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2)to the extent necessary to permit Nationwide to deduct any Income Tax Chargefrom the assets of the Separate Account. 28. Applicants submit that the exemptions afforded by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(iii)from sections 26(a) and 27(c)(2) could be narrowly interpreted to includeonly administrative fees associated with the operation of the SeparateAccount. Applicants, therefore, seek exemptive relief to the extent necessaryto deduct fees for any income taxes incurred by Nationwide and properlychargeable against the assets of the Separate Account, in addition to thepremium tax deduction specifically permitted by the Rule. Applicants assertthat if any Income Tax Charge, presently unanticipated, is imposed in thefuture, it will be limited to the tax liability actually incurred on suchgains, with no interest element. If any Income Tax Charge is ever implemented,it will be deducted from the Separate Account only as taxes become due,and will not be deducted and accumulated in Nationwide's general accountprior to the time and taxes are due. Such charge, if any, will be permittedby the policies and by state insurance laws, and will be fully disclosedin the prospectus if the charge is implemented. 29. Applicants submit that all other charges under the Policies are permittedby, and in conformance with the requirements of, subsection (b)(13)(iii)of Rule 6e-3(T). Applicants further submit that the relief requested bythe Application is identical to that requested by Nationwide Life InsuranceCompany and its Nationwide VLI Separate Account (File No. 812-6234) onOctober 25, 1985, as amended February 25, 1986 and March 4, 1986, and grantedby an Order in Release No. IC-15057, on April 23, 1986. <T3>Applicants' Undertakings: </T3>Applicants agree that if the requested Order is granted it will be expresslyconditioned on Applicants, compliance with the undertakings set forth above.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuantto delegated authority. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Shirley E.
