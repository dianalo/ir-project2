The acquisition, the first since the venture's formationlast December, gives it a No. 3 position behind Kellogg Co.,with 47%, and Weetabix, with a 19% market share in the U.K.Ranks also is the largest maker of private-branded cereals inBritain and distributes throughout Europe.</LP><TEXT>   Initially, the venture plans simply to operate thebusiness as is, but it hinted that eventually it would seekto expand with either current General Mills brands or newcereals.   Ranks Hovis had acquired the ready-to-eat cereal businessfrom RJR Nabisco, a unit of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.,two years ago for about $144 million (#80 million). Ranksdistributes its products, principally Shredded Wheat andShreddies, in most of Western Europe.   A Ranks Hovis official said the company decided to sellthe cereal operation partly out of frustration at not beingable to become &quot;a very strong second&quot; to Kellogg, and partlybecause it anticipates a bruising battle between Kellogg andthe joint venture.   &quot;We know Kellogg will defend like mad, and General Millsand Nestle will attack. So we sold it,&quot; said Bob Rogerson,Ranks Hovis finance director.   American cereal industry sources calculate that Irelandhas the biggest per-capital cereal consumption in the world,at more than 15 pounds a year. Britain and Australia are tiedfor second, at nearly 13 pounds each, followed by the U.S.with almost 10 pounds a person. While its population eatsmore cereal on a per-capita basis than the U.S., the UnitedKingdom is a much smaller market as measured by sales.   The U.S. is about a $6.5 billion market, while the U.K. isabout $1 billion, and all of Europe accounts for less than $2billion in annual sales. For now, the venture's distributionwon't include Ireland, officials said.   Although the European market is relatively small, bothpartners in the venture see considerable growth potential,particularly after trade barriers fall in 1992. Nestlealready has a cereal business in France, Spain and Portugal,as well as a huge marketing and distribution network, but itpreviously lacked a significant product mix.   Until now General Mills, the world's second-largest cerealmaker behind Kellogg, has been only a negligible factor onthe continent. It currently exports relatively small amountsof Cheerios, Golden Grahams and Cinnamon Toast Crunch (itsmost popular brand in Britain) to major supermarket chains aswell as Harrods, the London department-store outfit.   Both partners in the joint venture, CPW S.A., have saidthey intend to reach $1 billion in sales by the year 2000.CPW is headquartered in Morges, Switzerland.   The acquisition includes Shredded Wheat Co., with a plantat Welwyn Garden City near London; Viota Foods, with a cerealplant at Bromborough, England; and A.C. Fincken Ltd., with aplant at Watford, England.   ---   Richard E. Rustin contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
