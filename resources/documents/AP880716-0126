TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANI NAIM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The uprisings in the WestBank and Gaza Strip have spawned a new generation of Palestinianleaders and given their people confidence to challenge Israeli armyrule.   The change is evident here in Bani Naim, a farming town 17 milessouth of Jerusalem, where the streets are blackened from tiresburned in protest of Israeli occupation.   Hassan Manasara, 27, a leader of the town's resistance, said anew community spirit has taken shape and that a senior Israeliofficer encountered it when he came to Bani Naim to urge calm.   Manasara said the residents confounded the Israeli by refusingto answer simple questions about their place of work.   ``When the officer asked how many people are farmers, everyoneraised his hand,'' Manasara said. ``And when he asked how many workas laborers in Israel, everyone raised his hand.   ``The Israeli threatened to cut off the water, and everyonelaughed.''   Even so, Bani Naim has paid a heavy price. Residents say threetownspeople have been killed, 35 wounded and 150 arrested sinceDecember. The town of 10,000 also spent 20 days under anaround-the-clock curfew.   Residents agreed to on austerity measures, such as banning largewedding and graduation parties, to conserve resources to supportthe families of those without work or in jail.   The town is now run by ``popular committees.'' A securitycommittee patrols at night to watch for Israeli patrols, afirst-aid committee treats the injured, a finance committee handleswelfare.   Sari Nusseibah, a leading Palestinian intellectural, saidcommittees such as those in Bani Naim were the most hopeful sign ofthe uprising because they could be the foundation for a Palestinianstate.   But he added the new leadership was untested and suggested thatif the committees ``faded away,'' it might be more difficult torally Palestinians in the future.   He also said he was disappointed that Palestinians had notdeveloped a political strategy during the uprising.   ``I felt from the beginning that it is not enough to wage war,but you have to wage peace equally strongly,'' he said. ``To do onewithout the other is to waste effort.''   Some Israeli leaders contend the grass-roots leaders in townsand villages only carry out the orders of the PalestinianLiberation Organization, but Bani Naim's local leaders dispute this.   ``What's decided here is not from the outside. There are noorders from outside,'' said Manasara.   Much will depend on whether Palestinians continue to supportstrikes and civil disobedience, such as refusing to pay taxes oraccepting Israeli identity cards.   Saif-Edin Natsheh, 34, owner of a stone-cutting factory in theWest Bank town of Hebron, noted leaflets urged the development ofArab business to lessen dependence on Israel. But he complained thePalestinian self-reliance campaign was undermined by strikes andtax boycotts.   ``This month we only worked five days because of too many strikecalls,'' he said. ``How am I going to pay the seven workers andfeed my seven children with five days of work?''   Natsheh also said he was caught in the middle by the taxboycott, threatened with jail by the Israelis if he failed to payand fearful his factory would be burned down by Palestinians if hedid.   ``I pay in secret,'' he added.   Before the violence erupted in December, a web of economic andpersonal relations linked the 1.5 million Palestinians to Israel.   Some 110,000 Arabs shuttled daily to jobs in Israel and broughthome $500 million to $700 million a year. The West Bank and GazaStrip also became Israel's second-largest market, accounting for$780 million, or 11 percent, of exports in 1987.   Nusseibah, a professor of philosphy at Bir Zeit University inthe West Bank, said the biggest achievement of the uprising wasre-creating, at least psychologically, the border that dividedIsrael from the West Bank and Gaza before the 2,200 square miles ofland was seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.   ``A process of integration had been under way for the past 21years,'' he said. ``It was challenged in the uprising, and for thefirst time people began to practice what they preach.''   Bonds of practical coexistence have been torn by the bloodshedand mass arrests, which touched most villages and neighborhoods.   During the unrest, more than 200 Palestinians were killed.According to left-wing Israeli lawmaker Dedi Zucker, Arab injuriestotalled 5,132 by June and arrests had reached 17,000.   The hatred that fuels the unrest is also born of humiliation,which is intensely felt by those who have been arrested.   Abdel Aziz Randisi, a pediatrician jailed for six months withouttrial in the Ketziot prison camp in Israel's Negev Desert,complained to a reporter during a prison tour about being made tokneel down for roll calls and infractions of camp rules.   ``I would rather die than do this kneeling,'' he said.   Qassem Ali, a journalist from Gaza who was also in the prison,predicted such treatment of influential community leaders wouldboomerang on Israel.   ``I think the conditions here have made the people more radicaland created more hatred, and this will be a problem,'' he said.   In the West Bank town of Yatta, a 21-year-old student atBethlehem University who said he could not give his name because hewas wanted by authorities, spoke in a similar but more impassionedvein.   ``Before the uprising, people didn't have the will todemonstrate or throw a rock at a soldier,'' he said. ``Before theuprising people who worked in Israel were treated as slaves.   ``Now, we are human beings.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs July 20</NOTE></DOC>
