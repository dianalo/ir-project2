The rule, which is effective immediately, attempts to sidestep the thorny issue of federal intrusion into corporate governance -- historically the province of the states. It says only that companies that in the future reduce or abolish shareholders' voting rights can't be traded on the nation's stock exchanges or in the major over-the-counter market.    It also makes a variety of exemptions for existing issues of unequal stock and for future offerings in which purchasers can be &quot;fully aware&quot; of their lesser voting rights, said Richard Ketchum, the SEC's chief of market regulation.    Separately, the SEC retreated from a staff proposal that recommended the commission propose legislation prohibiting broker-dealers from making customers agree to binding arbitration before doing business with them. That proposal has drawn heavy fire from the securities industry since the commission indicated last month that it was inclined to support the proposal.    In a statement yesterday, the Securities Industry Association said it was &quot;pleased&quot; by the SEC's decision to drop the proposal and instead ask the exchanges and the industry to consider ways to improve arbitration procedures and disclosures about those procedures.    But the day's most significant action involved the one share, one vote issue, which the commission has been considering for nearly two years amid intense lobbying. In attempting to strike a compromise on the matter yesterday, the SEC managed to displease the chairmen of both congressional committees that oversee it.    Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.) oppose each other on the issue of unequal voting rights, but both criticized the SEC action. Rep. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement that he is glad the SEC acted, but added: &quot;It's too bad they didn't come up with a better rule.&quot; A spokesman for Mr. Dingell said, &quot;The exemptions ate the rule.&quot;    Meanwhile, Sen. Proxmire, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, who has argued the SEC lacks the authority to make rules on corporate governance, blasted the move as &quot;legally unauthorized&quot; and said &quot;it should be struck down&quot; by the courts.    The rule adopted by the SEC is narrowly constructed to target only instances of &quot;disenfranchisement,&quot; in which shareholders' existing rights are somehow reduced. Consequently, it exempts various situations in which a company can issue stock with unequal voting rights. Most important is a broad exemption for state antitakeover laws such as Indiana's that place conditions on the voting rights of big holders seeking control of a company.    In addition, the rule &quot;grandfathers&quot; in for exchange-listing companies that already have disparate voting rights, such as &quot;supervoting&quot; stock. The issuance of unequal stock is a major form of defense against hostile takeovers. Reorganizations of corporate voting rights became common in recent years in response to the takeover boom of the 1980s.    Currently, there are 60 concerns traded on the New York Stock Exchange that have disparate voting rights or plan to introduce such stock, 117 on the American Stock Exchange, and 182 on the National Association of Securities Dealers' automated quotation system, according to the SEC. Among the concerns with unequal rights listed on the Big Board is Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal.    But Mr. Ketchum of the SEC said he doesn't expect the agency's narrowly crafted rule &quot;to have a dramatic effect on takeovers, one way or the other.&quot;    The rule also permits stock with unequal voting rights in initial public offerings and in issuances made to effect acquisitions. Secondary offerings of unequal stock also are allowed as long as the new stock carries fewer voting rights than the existing stock. &quot;The view of the commission is that people walking into these situations are perfectly aware that they aren't buying meaningful voting rights,&quot; Mr. Ketchum said.    Foreign companies traded in the U.S. also are exempted.    The rule was approved by a 4-1 vote, with Commissioner Charles Cox dissenting. Mr. Cox argued that the rule intrudes the SEC into corporate governance, saying: &quot;This is an improper use of the listing standards to tamper with, basically, a corporate governance issue, and thereby is an unwise policy step.&quot;    Mr. Cox was joined in his opposition by the SEC's chief economist, Kenneth Lehn, who warned the commission that it was embarking on a course &quot;that will enmesh it deeper and deeper&quot; in corporate capitalization issues.    The SEC also voted on two other issues yesterday. One reason for the packed agenda was that the meeting was the last for Commissioner Aulana Peters, whose resignation becomes effective today. With the departure of Ms. Peters, who has been a frequent ally of SEC Chairman David Ruder, many observers both in and out of the SEC expect the commission to frequently hit 2-2 deadlocks on market-regulation issues.    In its other votes, the commission voted to generally make public its disciplinary proceedings against lawyers and accountants who work on the filings that all public companies must make with the SEC. Currently, almost all of the SEC proceedings against members of those professions are conducted privately, while its actions against members of the securities industry, such as stockbrokers, are public. The rule change will take effect later this summer, and won't be retroactive.    Finally, the commission voted to propose for comment a new rule that would require annual reports and annual 10K filings with the SEC to include a statement by management acknowledging its responsibility for the company's financial statements and discussing how those responsibilities were fulfilled. </TEXT></DOC>
