The aim is to trim as much as $370 million from next year's budget, the nation's largest securities firm said.    Merrill Lynch officials declined to estimate how many employees are targeted for layoffs. The officials said that final decisions haven't been made, and that the subject wasn't appropriate to discuss in detail before the holidays.    However, a senior Merrill Lynch official said that he &quot;wouldn't be shocked&quot; to see 2,000 people laid off, or about 4% of the staff, as a result of budget decisions to be completed during the third week in January. Merrill Lynch has 47,000 employees.    &quot;We don't have any plan for any numbers of layoffs,&quot; William A. Schreyer, Merrill's chairman and chief executive officer, said at a news conference yesterday. Mr. Schreyer endorsed another executive's statement that staff cuts would be made with &quot;more of a rifle approach&quot; than the across-the-board cuts some firms have announced.    Merrill Lynch yesterday outlined several steps aimed at producing its desired cost reductions. John L. Steffens, president of Merrill's consumer markets division, said the cost-cutting plan for 1988 involves cuts in compensation, plus some possible fee increases for services to customers. He said the fee increases wouldn't affect commissions for stock and bond transactions.    Merrill's announcement marks the latest in a wide-ranging retrenchment that is roiling Wall Street. About 4,000 employee layoffs have been announced so far, including 1,000 at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., which announced earlier this month the largest Wall Street layoff to date.    At least another 5,000 persons are expected to be fired as a result of the Shearson Lehman Holdings Inc.-E.F. Hutton Group Inc. merger.    Despite the market crash and a $277 million pretax mortgage-security trading loss in May, Merrill officials expect total compensation expenses to increase in 1987 to about $3.7 billion from $3.6 billion, one senior official said. The official said the firm hopes its cost-cutting program would knock between 5% and 10% of these costs out of next year's budget, for a savings of between $185 million and $370 million.    For the first nine months of 1987, Merrill's earnings were up 43% from a year earlier to $387.1 million. However, those earnings include certain special gains: $100.3 million on the sale of its right to acquire a partnership stake in one of its headquarters buildings, $76.2 million from the sale of a leasing portfolio, and $48.3 million from the sale of its residential real estate network.    One official said he expected that for 1987, investment banking bonuses would be up, but that trading bonuses would generally be down. Trading performances were hurt by the market crash and by the bond trading setbacks in April and May.    Merrill Lynch officials said that because they started restructuring three years ago, they have had &quot;one of the lowest rates of expense growth on Wall Street over the past several years.&quot;    For example, the firm has laid off about 25% of its municipal bond staff, reducing it to 319 employees from 420, since 1986, officials said.    However, Merrill Lynch's profit margins have continued to lag some competitors, some Merrill officials say. &quot;There's definitely room for us to take a look at our expenses around here,&quot; said one official. &quot;Just look at our profit margins -- they aren't as good as Shearson Lehman's.&quot;    Shearson, which is gearing up to challenge Merrill as the nation's largest retail brokerage firm, is known for maintaining some of the industry's lowest operating costs.    The firm said it will reduce the payout to its retail stockbrokers by 6%. The reduction will come in part from cutting the percentage of revenue that the firm's best producers take home, and in part by making it harder for brokers to reach certain revenue targets. The compensation cut will save the firm about $65 million, officials said.    Merrill said it will freeze salaries for non-clerical employees for six months. One official said the freeze will affect roughly 80% of the amount the firm pays in salaries.    Merrill also intends to cut bonuses to employees such as managers, investment bankers and traders, whose compensation generally has been boosted considerably by such payments in the past. The firm said that if revenue for 1988 equals 1987 levels, it will accrue 10% less for bonuses in 1988. If, as expected, revenue falls further, bonuses will be down more than 10% in 1988, Merrill said.    Individual bonuses, however, would still fluctuate depending on performance.    Two months ago, the firm told institutional salesmen that in 1988 their compensation will be switched from a commission system to a salary and bonus system. The salesmen's bonuses will be lumped into a pool with the firm's traders. The move gives Merrill more flexibility in compensating salesmen, who, for example, would now have to share in any trading setbacks incurred by the firm. </TEXT></DOC>
