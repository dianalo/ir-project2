Schmitt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ACS LKS </CO><IN> RFD TNM </IN><DATELINE> DUBLIN, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lucky Stores Inc. agreed to an estimated $61-a-share, or $2.35 billion, leveraged buy-out, but American Stores Co. indicated it might still press a rival bid.    The leveraged buy-out is being orchestrated with Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen, and, if completed, would represent by far the biggest transaction ever for the specialty investment banker. Terms call for Lucky shareholders to receive $56 in cash and $7 stated value of preferred stock for each share. Analysts estimated the current value of the preferred at about $5 a share.    &quot;We believe the transaction . . . is very beneficial to our stockholders and allows Lucky to continue with its plans for growth,&quot; said John M. Lillie, chairman of Lucky, in a statement.    But the bidding may not be over. Lucky indicated it rejected a sweetened $60-a-share offer from Salt Lake City-based American Stores, which had previously offered to negotiate a friendly merger at $50 a share. And in a letter disclosed yesterday, American reiterated that it believed its financial strength and other factors made it best qualified to make the highest bid for its grocery-store chain rival.    Lucky stock surged above the $61 level on news of the buy-out agreement, indicating that investors believe a higher bid may be coming. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lucky shares jumped $5.375 to close at $61.50.    American Stores and Lucky officials weren't available for comment.    Gibbons, a 16-person firm with offices in New York and Los Angeles, specializes in leveraged transactions. But purchasing Lucky would far exceed its two biggest conquests: the $580 million acquisition of Bath Iron Works Corp., a Maine ship builder, and the $490 million purchase of Budget Rent a Car Corp., both in 1986.    Lately, it has been on the losing end of several deals. Before Campeau Corp. intervened, it expressed interest in acquiring Ralph's grocery chain in Southern California from Federated Department Stores Inc. Just this week, it saw a buy-out of CNW Corp. terminated by the company because of labor problems.    Gibbons officials weren't available for comment.    A buy-out of Lucky presents several challenges, however. The main one would be trimming the huge long-term debt that would be incurred to complete the transaction. One of Lucky's chief rivals, Oakland-based Safeway Stores Inc., which completed its own leveraged buy-out in 1986, has been able to rapidly pare debt through asset sales. But Lucky sold large non-essential assets in a restructuring last year.    The remaining assets that could be sold, analysts said, are grocery operations in Florida and Arizona as well as a joint interest in the firm that owns the company's former Midwestern division. In addition, Lucky may be able to profitably refinance leases covering stores in its main California market. But analysts said all those moves combined would still pale beside the huge debt.    If the transaction is completed, some analysts said Lucky may be forced to rethink its whole retailing strategy. Until now, the company has been able to consistently price lower than its competitors because of lower operating costs and less burdensome debt. It may not have that luxury anymore.    &quot;Lucky has established itself for 25 years for its low-price leadership. The debt from this transaction may greatly inhibit its ability to follow the same strategy,&quot; said John B. Kosecoff, retailing analyst for First Manhattan Co.    While American Stores' officials weren't commenting yesterday, the company's track record indicates it wouldn't be averse to launching a hostile bid. In 1984, the company acquired Chicago-based Jewel Cos. through an unsolicited $1.15 billion tender offer after reportedly making three unsuccessful overtures over several years. And in recent letters to Lucky management, American Stores Chairman L.S. Skaggs has raised the possibility of tougher tactics, including litigation.    &quot;Indeed, I have not foreclosed the possibility of paying more than $60 per Lucky share if Lucky can convince American Stores that the values inherent in Lucky justify a higher price,&quot; Mr. Skaggs wrote to Mr. Lillie on Wednesday.    &quot;The market is either saying the offer is worth $61.50 a share or that the bidding is going higher,&quot; said Jonathan Ziegler, a grocery analyst for Sutro andamp; Co., San Francisco, referring to Lucky's closing price on the Big Board yesterday. &quot;Right now, there is no reason to say that this game of musical chairs is over.&quot;    Lucky disclosed that it granted Gibbons an option to acquire an unspecified number of newly issued shares. Such a provision is commonly used to lock up deals with allies and could present an obstacle -- or grist for a lawsuit -- to American Stores.    Terms of the pact call for Gibbons to form a new company that will begin a $61-a-share cash tender offer by next Wednesday for 92%, or about 35.7 million, of Lucky's shares outstanding. Following the tender offer, each of the remaining shares will be exchanged for a share of the $7 preferred stock. The preferred will have a dividend of 15%, but payable in preferred shares, instead of cash, for the first five years.    Lucky said the offer effectively amounts to $56 in cash and $7 stated value of the preferred for each common share. It said Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. each concluded the offer was fair to shareholders from a financial point of view.    Gibbons said it expects to retain Lucky's management, which is expected to have an equity stake in the surviving company. The firm said it doesn't expect financing problems, having received a &quot;highly confident letter&quot; from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and proposals from several banks. </TEXT></DOC>
