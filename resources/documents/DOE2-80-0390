Digestorperformances, i.e. daily methane yields, volatile acid concentrations,pH and relative rates of utilization of acetate, propionate and glucosewere monitored. Rates of utilization were determined prior to, duringinitial time periods following a change in total ammonia concentrationand after acclimation had occurred. Digestor performances indicated inhibitionoccurred, followed by return to steady-state performance. Relative ratesof acetate utilization were most affected by changes in total ammoniaconcentrations. Thus, we concluded that methanogenic metabolism was primarilyinhibited by a high concentration of total ammonia. Anaerobic digestionof manure-bovine serum albumin as an example of manure containing highconcentrations of proteinaceous material was also performed at threedifferent added protein concentrations. Digestor instability was proportionalto protein concentration.</TEXT></DOC>
