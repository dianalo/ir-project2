Under the provisions of chapter 55,title 10, section 1092, the demonstration project will test the feasibilityof giving the commanding officer both the authority and responsibilityfor all health care delivery within the catchment area. By influencingthe distribution of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the UniformedServices (CHAMPUS) and direct care costs within the Operations and Maintenance,Navy (Oandamp;M,N) funds budgeted for the catchment area, it is anticipatedthat the commanding officer can enhance both the quality and quantity ofhealthcare delivery within the catchment area, while containing costs.The project will demonstrate that the patterns of beneficiary healthcareuse within a Navy MTF catchment area can be modified to reduce the totalcost of healthcare below levels that would have otherwise resulted. Thiswill be accomplished by giving the MTF commander authority to provide foralternate means of healthcare delivery, using portions of the catchmentarea's budgeted CHAMPUS, as well as direct care funds. An independent evaluationof this project will be conducted by the Rand Corporation, who will determinethe degree to which healthcare services at the demonstration site are beingprovided in a manner which meets the stated objectives of the project.The objectives of the demonstration are to (1) contain the rate of growthof government health care expenditures, (2) improve accessibility to cost-effectivehealthcare services, (3) improve beneficiary and provider satisfactionwith availability and accessibility of health care services, (4) maintainthe quality of care provided to the CHAMPUS beneficiary population, and(5) ensure meaningful caseload and enhance the practice environment ofactive duty providers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>Implementation date of the demonstration projectis 1 January 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>CAPT Taylor I.

Background</ITAG>Until recently, there was no mechanism to convert innovations in CHAMPUShealthcare delivery into increased resources in the MTF. In FY 88, CHAMPUSfunding was allocated to the individual Services. Each Service is now responsiblefor the total CHAMPUS bill for care provided for all Services' beneficiarieswithin specific catchment areas, as well as to its own beneficiaries outsidecatchment areas. In an attempt to evaluate the concept that the servicescan effectively manage these funds and provide necessary medical care withinthe projected CHAMPUS and direct care budgets, Congress directed in theFY 88 Defense Authorization Act that each Service conduct a demonstrationof catchment area management in at least one area. During the demonstrationall normal CHAMPUS requirements apply except those that are specificallyidentified herein as subject to deviation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. What the Demonstration Project Is Designed To Test</ITAG>Catchment Area Management is based on the premise that the local MTF commanderis responsible for all medical care provided to the eligible DoD beneficiarypopulation within a radius of approximately 40 miles to the MTF. To fulfillthat responsibility, the commander will control the funds customarily allocatedto operate the MTF, plus have discretion in use of the funds projectedto be spent for civilian care under CHAMPUS. At the same time, he willbe allowed increased flexibility in dealing with regulatory restrictionsto enhance his ability to select the most cost effective options in deliveringcare to the beneficiary population. The demonstration will test whether,by increasing local participation in the control and distribution of theCHAMPUS and direct care dollars, the MTF commander can enhance the levelof services and maintain quality, while not exceeding the total projectedhealthcare costs for the catchment area in the absence of this demonstration.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Key Features</ITAG>The Navy CAM Demonstration Project within the catchment area of the NavalHospital, Charleston, South Carolina will be structured on increased utilizationof the clinical care capacity of the Naval Hospital and the CharlestonAir Force Base Clinic, in combination with a military managed preferredprovider network. This combination is designed to provide a managed healthcaresystem for all beneficiaries within the demonstration project site whovoluntarily enroll or participate. Enhanced MTF care capability will beaccomplished through personnel acquisitions using Civil Service, VA-DoDresource sharing, service contracting, and CHAMPUS partnership agreements.The mix of services provided will be determined through cost benefit analysisand consideration of graduate medical education and contingency requirements.The mix and size of the preferred provider network will be based on residualcare requirements after increased utilization of the MTF has been factoredinto the total catchment area demand.The project will be expected to reduce total Oandamp;M,N expenditures inthe Charleston Catchment Area through several processes. Cost benefit analyseshave shown that, in most cases, the increased variable and semivariablecosts incurred by the MTF in partnership agreements still allow for significantsavings over the cost of similar services provided under the existing CHAMPUSsystem. In those cases where care requirements exceed the capacity of theMTF, the preferred provider network will lower overall costs of care receivedoutside the MTF relative to existing CHAMPUS. This will occur through theprocess of discounts on per unit cost, utilization management using pre-authorizationfor high volume, high cost procedures, and case management and dischargeplanning. Since beneficiary enrollment and participation is voluntary,the magnitude of cost containment of this system is a function of the percentof the beneficiary population that enrolls and uses the system as an alternativeto existing CHAMPUS. The system will market two care options (CAMCHAS andCHAMCHAS PRIME) which offer different incentives and vary in the degreeof freedom of the consumer to use the existing CHAMPUS system. The centralmanagement element for both will be the healthcare finder system. Thiswill be a centralized appointment system based on the Composite HealthcareSystem Patient Appointment and Scheduling Module. It will provide appointmentsfirst to the MTFs and then to the network providers, if appointments arenot available in a prescribed period of time at the MTF. The ``CAMCHAS''option will appeal to those consumers who may desire to use existing CHAMPUSbut will be attracted because they can use the healthcare finder and participatingphysicians whose charges are below CHAMPUS prevailing rates. The ``CAMCHASPRIME'' option will be a voluntary enrollment plan. As participants ina program designed to monitor utilization and provide cost-effective care,the enrollees will be required to use the healthcare finder system andparticipating physicians. Without the ability currently to mandate enrollment,the ``CAMCHAS PRIME'' program will offer incentives to voluntary enrollment_theindividual and family deductible will be reduced by 50 percent and non-professionaloutpatient fees and all professional fee copayments will be reduced from20 percent to 15 percent for active duty beneficiaries and 25 percent to20 percent for retirees and their beneficiaries. Enrollee copayments forinpatient hospitalization will remain unchanged. Enrollees must go throughhealthcare finders who will ascertain the availability of MTF care priorto authorizing care with network providers. Requirements for non-availabilitystatements will remain unchanged. Enrollees who do not use healthcare findersto obtain outpatient healthcare locally will pay the usual CHAMPUS rate,plus a penalty of an additional 5 percent in CHAMPUS copayments for outpatientservices. For example, copayments for dependents of active duty enrolleeswould be increased from 20 percent to 25 percent of CHAMPUS allowable andthe government share would decrease from 80 percent to 75 percent for outpatientcare not obtained through healthcare finders. The healthcare finder system will initiate utilization management by establishingthe initial primary care assessments by internists, family practitioners,pediatricians, or obstetricians/gynecologists. It will allow for genericpre-authorization of follow up appointments. All subsequent extension ofvisit requirements, specialty consultations, or hospital admissions willbe required to come through the healthcare finder system for appointmentand review. Hospitalization and specialty review will be performed primarilyby department heads at the naval hospital. This will be done on the basisof availability of care and facilitated by the use of availability templatesin the computer system. Enrollment into the managed care system will be coordinated with providerparticipation to assure acceptable access to care. Because enrollment isvoluntary, total enrollment levels will be subject to the overall effectivenessof the managed care marketing effort. Disenrollment will be allowed withoutcause after a year's participation or during the first year through a formalgrievance process. Disenrollment will also occur when families move outof the catchment area or members lose eligibility. For care provided tobeneficiaries outside of the project catchment area, standard CHAMPUS reimbursementand out of pocket charges will apply. Separate fiscal intermediary procedureswill identify enrollee claims. Claims processing will be performed by thecurrent CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary. The demonstration project alters the normally applicable cost-sharing requirementsin the CHAMPUS regulation, DoD 6010.8-R, Chapter 4, Section F. In additionto reduced cost share requirements, additional discounts available fromthe preferred providers will further reduce the actual beneficiary cost.All network providers will accept the discounted CHAMPUS determined allowablecharge as payment in full, so that the beneficiary's financial responsibilitywill be limited to copayment. The Navy reserves the right during the course of this demonstration projectto implement additional changes which will improve our ability to meetoverall project objectives. Where necessary, these changes will be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The Department of the Navy anticipates that the Catchment Area ManagementDemonstration will provide enhanced levels of service at discounted rates.This will result in more appropriate care being delivered with no increasesin the overall direct care and CHAMPUS budgets. Overall savings dependupon the total number of beneficiaries who enroll in the plan and the numberof participating preferred providers. <ITAG tagnum="84">V.
