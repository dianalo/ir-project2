On May 27, 1987, the Government of Mexico requested in accordancewith 19 CFR 355.10 an administrative review of the order. We publishedthe initiation of the administrative review on June 19, 1987 (52 FR 23330).The Department has now conducted this administrative review in accordancewith section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international system of Customs nomenclature. We will be providingboth the appropriate Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (``TSUSA'')item numbers and the appropriate Harmonized System (``HS'') item numberswith our product descriptions. As with the TSUSA, the HS item numbers areprovided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written descriptionremains dispositive.Imports covered by this review are shipments of bricks from Mexico, includingunglazed solid bricks and unglazed hollow bricks. Such merchandise is currentlyclassifiable under items 532.1120 and 532.1140 of the TSUSA and item 6904.10.00-0of the HS. The review covers the period January 1, 1986 through December 31, 1986and 18 programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>(1) FOMEXThe Fund for the Promotion of Exports of Mexican Manufactured Products(``FOMEX'') is a trust of the Mexican Treasury Department, with the NationalBank of Foreign Trade acting as trustee for the program. The National Bankof Foreign Trade, through financial institutions, makes FOMEX loans availableat preferential rates to Mexican exporters and U.S. importers for two purposes:pre-export financing and export financing. We consider both pre-exportand export FOMEX loans to confer export bounties or grants since theseloans are given at preferential rates only on merchandise destined forexport. We found that the annual interest rates that financial institutionscharged borrowers for peso-denominated FOMEX pre-export financing outstandingduring the period of review ranged from 39.60 to 70.00 percent. The annualinterest rates for dollar-denominated FOMEX financing outstanding duringthe period of review ranged from 5.50 to 7.40 percent.We consider the benefit from loans to occur when the interest is paid.Interest on FOMEX pre-export loans is paid at maturity, and those thatmatured during the period of review were obtained between November 1985and November 1986. Since interest on FOMEX export loans is pre-paid, wecalculated benefits from all FOMEX export loans received during the periodof review.The Banco de Mexico stopped publishing data on nominal and effective commerciallending rates after 1984. Therefore, as the basis for our benchmark, wehave relied in part on the rates for the years 1981 through 1984, as publishedin the Banco de Mexico's <T3>Indicadores Economicos y Moneda</T3> (I.E.). We calculated the averagedifference between the I.E. effective interest rates and the Costo PorcentualPromedio (CPP) rates, the average cost of short-term funds to banks, forthe years 1981 through 1984. We added this average difference to the 1985and 1986 CPP rates. In this way, we calculated a benchmark of 86.39 percentfor pre-export peso loans obtained in 1985, and 135.27 percent for pre-exportpeso loans obtained in 1986.To determine the effective interest rate benchmark for dollar loans, weused the quarterly weighted-average effective interest rates publishedin the <T3>Federal Register Bulletin, </T3>which was 10.47 percent in 1986.Five of the 29 known exporters of this merchandise used this program duringthe period of review. Because we found that the exporters were able totie both types of FOMEX loans to exports to specific countries, we measuredthe benefit only from FOMEX loans tied to U.S. shipments. We allocatedthe FOMEX benefits over U.S. shipments, excluding those firms with significantlydifferent (including <T3>de minimis</T3>) aggregate benefits. We preliminarily determine thebenefit from FOMEX during the period of review to be 4.59 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for all firms except those with zero or <T3>de minimis </T3>aggregate benefits.In May 1988, the Banco de Mexico changed the interest rates on FOMEX pesoloans to 66.00 percent and on FOMEX dollars loans to 7.70 percent. To calculatethe FOMEX benefit for cash deposit purposes, we followed the same methodologyused in calculating the assesssment rates. For peso loans we used as ourbenchmark the sum of the May 1988 CPP rate and the average 1981-1984 spreadbetween the CPP and the I.E. effective rates. For dollar loans we usedas our benchmark the May 1988 weighted-average effective interest ratefrom the <T3>Federal Reserve Bulletin.</T3> On this basis, we preliminarily find,for purposes of cash deposits of estimated countervailing duties, a FOMEXbenefit of 0.58 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for all firms except those with zero or <T3>de minimis</T3> aggregate benefits.(2) FONEIThe Fund for Industrial Development (``FONEI''), administered by the Bancode Mexico, is a specialized financial development fund that provides long-termloans at below-market rates. FONEI loans are available under various provisionswith different eligibility requirements. The plant expansion provisionis designed for the creation, expansion, or modernization of enterprisesin order to promote the efficient production of goods capable of competingin the international market or to meet the objectives of the National DevelopmentPlan (NDP), which include industrial decentralization. We consider thisFONEI loan provision to confer a bounty or grant because it restricts benefitsto those enterprises located outside of Zone IIIA. Three firms made paymentson variable-rate peso-denominated FONEI loans for plant expansion or modernizationoutstanding during the period of review.We treated these variable-rate loans as a series of short-term loans. Tocalculate the benefit, we used the same benchmarks as for the FOMEX peso-denominatedpre-export loans and compared them with the preferential interest ratesin effect for each FONEI loan payment made during the period of review.We allocated the benefits over each company's total sales to all markets.One of these firms had <T3>de minimis</T3> aggregate benefits. For the remaining firms that madeinterest payments on FONEI loans, we weight-averaged the resulting benefitsby each company's proportion of exports to the United States of this merchandiseduring the period of review, excluding those firms with significantly different(including <T3>de minimis</T3>) aggregate benefits. We preliminarily determine thebenefit from this program during the period of review to be 0.03 percent<T3>ad valorem</T3> for all firms except those with zero or <T3>de minimis </T3>aggregate benefits.(3) FOGAINThe Guarantee and Development Fund for Medium and Small Industries (``FOGAIN'')is a program that provides long-term loans to all small and medium-sizefirms in Mexico. The interest rates available under the program vary dependingon whether a small or medium-size business has been granted priority status,and whether a business is located in a zone targeted for industrial growth.Although FOGAIN loans are available to all small and medium-size firmsin Mexico, regardless of the type of industry or location, some companiesget more beneficial rates than others. Therefore, to the extent that thisprogram provides financing at rates below the least beneficial rate availableunder FOGAIN, we consider it to be countervailable. Five firms had long-term variable-rate FOGAIN loans on which interest paymentswere due during the period of review. Because the interest rate on allFOGAIN loans is subject to change and changed during the period of review,we treated each loan as a series of short-term loans and used as our benchmarksthe least beneficial FOGAIN interest rates in effect for each loan payment.We allocated the benefits from each loan over each company's total salesto all markets. We then weight-averaged the resulting benefits by eachcompany's proportion of exports of this merchandise to the United Statesduring the period of review, excluding those firms with significantly different(including <T3>de minimis</T3>) aggregate benefits. We preliminarily determine thebenefit from this program during the period of review to be 0.45 percent<T3>ad valorem</T3> for all firms except those with zero or <T3>de minimis </T3>aggregate benefits.(4) Other ProgramsWe also examined the following programs and preliminarily determine thatexporters of bricks did not use them during the review period;(A) State tax incentives;(B) National Industrial Development Fund (``FOMIN'');(C) NDP preferential discounts;(D) Trust Fund for the Study and Development of Industrial Parks (``FIDEIN'');(E) Bancomext loans;(F) Delay of payment on loans;(G) Delay of payments to PEMEX of fuel charges;(H) PROFIDE loans;(I) Export credit insurance;(J) Tax Rebate Certificate (``CEDI'');(K) Accelerated depreciation;(L) Article 15 loans;(M) Preferential state investment incentives;(N) Import duty reductions and exemptions; and(O) CEPROFI fiscal incentives<ITAG tagnum="84">Firms Not Receiving Benefits</ITAG>We preliminarily determine that the following 22 firms received zero or<T3>de minimis </T3>benefits during the period of review:(1) Blanca Salvidar Gonzalez;(2) Bloques Ladrillos y Materiales de Piedras Negras;(3) Elias Martinez Ledezma;(4) Gregorio Moreno;(5) Jesus Galvan Mesa;(6) Joaquin Guerra R.;(7) Ladrillera Arcoiris;(8) Ladrillera Azteca;(9) Ladrillera Cantu;(10) Ladrillera Guadalupana;(11) Ladrillera La Joya;(12) Ladrillera Monterrey;(13) Ladrillera Reynosa;(14) Ladrillera Rio Bravo;(15) Ladrillera San Juan;(16) Ladrillera San Marcos;(17) Ladrillera Santa Fe;(18) Ladrillera Reynosa;(19) Luis de Hoyos Villareal(20) Materiales Salinas;(21) Productos de Barro La Zacatosa; and(22) Ricardo Francisco Garza Vela.For purposes of cash deposits of estimated countervailing duties, two additionalfirms, Barros Mecanizados and Jorge Vasquez Narro, received <T3>de minimis </T3>benefits. Because these firms are not part of the country-wideweighted-average deposit rate, the ``all other'' deposit rate is slightlydifferent from the sum of individual program rates listed in this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of Review</ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the total bountyor grant during the period January 1, 1986 through December 31, 1986 tobe zero or <T3>de minimis </T3>for 22 firms, and 5.07 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for all other firms.The Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, withoutregard to countervailing duties, shipments of this merchandise from the22 firms listed above and to assess countervailing duties of 5.07 percentof the f.o.b. invoice price on shipments from all other firms exportedon or after January 1, 1986 and entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, forconsumption before August 24, 1986, the date of Mexico's accession to theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).The merchandise covered by this review is afforded duty-free status underthe Generalized System of Preferences. Section 303 of the Tariff Act prohibitsthe imposition of countervailing duties on duty-free products absent aninjury test when the United States has an ``international obligation''to provide such a test. Mexico's accession to the GATT imposes such aninternational obligation on the United States with respect to duty-freemerchandise entered into the United States after the date of Mexico's accession.We are currently pursuing means by which an injury determination couldbe made concerning imports of Mexican bricks entered on or after August24, 1986, the date of Mexico's accession to the GATT. We do not intend to instruct the Customs Service to liquidate shipmentsof bricks entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or afterAugust 24, 1986, until we resolve this issue.As provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, the Department intendsto instruct the Customs Service to collect a cash deposit of estimatedcountervailing duties of zero from the 22 firms listed above, as well asBarros Mecanizados and Jorge Vasquez Narro, and to collect 1.08 percentof the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of this merchandise from allother firms, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on orafter the date of publication of the final results of this review. Thisdeposit requirement shall remain in effect until publication of the finalresults of the next administrative review.Interested parties may submit written comments on these preliminary resultswithin 30 days of the date of publication of this notice and may requestdisclosure and/or a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication.Any hearing, if requested, will be held 30 days after the date of publicationor the first workday following. Any request for an administrative protectiveorder must be made no later than five days after the date of publication.The Department will publish the final results of this administrative reviewincluding the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such writtencomments or at a hearing.This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 355.10.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: December 24, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
