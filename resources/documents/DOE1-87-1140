In view of the growing interest in ATES technology throughoutthe world, it would be wise to set up, as early as possible, a communicationsframework to sort, store and retrieve an ever growing body of informationon field experiences. Standardization of terminolgy and relevant factorsto be measured and reported is clearly necessary to facilitate technologytransfer in a meaningful way. Hence, the relevant geotechnical factorsmust be noted for any attempts at rationalization of predictive models.This paper presents a description of the various geotechnical factorswhich influence ATES technology. Comments are included on the managementand cost aspects of two Canadian demonstration studies which have benefitedfrom an awareness of the geotechnical factors relevant to ATES projects.Experience with these projects indicates the need for standardizationof terminology, symbols and units in ATES applications. Recommendationshave been given in this paper for a proposed classification and groupingof the commonly used terms to enhance technical communications amongworkers in this field. 8 refs., 1 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
