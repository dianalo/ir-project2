Seriously. That's the wordfrom the Baseball Hall of Fame. The practice of fungo hitting -- which datesto 1867 -- is used during infield practice, when a coach tosses a ball intothe air and hits it on the way down to an infielder or outfielder. The fungobat, then, is a lighter, longer, easier-to-handle version of a game bat. JimmyReese, the California Angels' 85-year-old conditioning coach (and formerroommate of Babe Ruth), is baseball's acknowledged master fungo hitter.
