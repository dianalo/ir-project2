In all cases carbon dioxide is liberatedand lower fatty acids and ketones can be identified as reaction products.a-Hydroxy and a-aminocarboxylic acids proved to be very effective reducingagents towards 1. The yield of copper varied from 2 to 2.5 mol Cu per1 mol of amino acid. The reaction of 1 is suppressed by sulfuric acid.The presence of hydrochlorid acid or chlorides leads to the precipitationof copper(I)chloride. The mechanisms of the decomposition of the varioustypes of carboxylic acids is discussed. It was also possible to precipitatemetallic copper by means of various proteins.</TEXT></DOC>
