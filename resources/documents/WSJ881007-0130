John Egan, commissioner of the state's Office of General Services, said the contract was awarded competitively to Eastern Microwave Inc. of Syracuse, N.Y., International Business Machines Corp. and several Nynex Corp. units. The network, which will cut operating costs as much as $150 million, is the biggest the state has awarded for telecommunications services.    The system, known as Empire Net, will connect 8,000 state agency circuits currently in separate networks. It will replace computer networks currently servicing 98 state agencies, including the state lottery's 4,000 agents.    State officials noted that Network Strategies Inc. of Fairfax, Va., was consultant to the state for technical and financial evaluation.    (Revised WSJ Oct. 11, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
