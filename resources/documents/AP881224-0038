Nothing in the cockpit conversations preceding the Wednesdaynight crash was unusual until the ``faint noise at the end, whichneeds a bit more analysis,'' he said.   NBC News quoted unidentified U.S. officials as saying the top CIAofficial in Beirut, Lebanon, was on the jet. The report Friday nightdid not name the CIA official, and the White House and StateDepartment refused comment on whether a CIA official was on theplane.   The search continued today for bodies and clues, and police saidthere would be no break for Christmas.   David Learmount, a respected aviation editor at FlightInternational, the industry magazine, said the ``black box''recording supported the theory that a bomb caused the crash, whichkilled all 258 people aboard and devastated the Scottish village ofLockerbie with its flaming wreckage.   Twenty townspeople were missing and feared dead, includingdrivers of three cars caught in the inferno.   ``The black boxes have told us that it was an instantaneouscatastrophe. That is why the bomb theory's very much the favorite,''Learmount told Independent Television News on Friday night.   ``The bomb theory explains everything which happened. ... If thiscase was just simple metal fatigue failure, it would have had tohave been cataclysmic, really extraordinarily unlikely. But if itdid happen, we really have to know and know fast,'' he said.   But Mick Charles, head of a team of 40 U.S. and Britishinvestigators at the site, said, ``We have no evidence whatsoeveryet of sabotage.''   Strong suspicions of a terrorist bombing built swiftly followingan Iranian group's claim of responsibility, the revelation that theU.S. government had been warned of a threat against a Pan Am plane,and the fact the plane suddenly broke apart in flight.   Anger at the government's failure to notify the public of thethreat _ against a Pan Am jet flying from Frankfurt to New Yorksometime in December _ surfaced Friday when it became known theUnited States notified Britain.   The government's reticence meant ``the poor, ignorant travelingpublic taking greater risks,'' charged John Prescott of theopposition Labor Party. Anthony Beaumont-Dark of the governingConservatives agreed.   Transport Minister Michael Portillo, responding to the criticism,said the threat, phoned in to the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki on Dec.5, was ``confidential, classified U.S. intelligence information andwe didn't have the right to divulge it.''   Heathrow Airport's security for American flights was reviewed anddetermined to be strict enough not to warrant divulging theanonymous threat, Portillo said on British Broadcasting Corp.television.   Victims' relatives began to arrive in Lockerbie, a community of2,500, to claim their dead. Seven Americans were among the arrivals,who were being counseled by social workers.   Makeshift morgues in the town hall and in an ice rink havereceived 155 bodies, and the search goes on.   Wreaths appeared outside the morgues. One bouquet, from apassenger who took Flight 103 from Frankfurt to London, was to achild flying on to New York.   ``To the little girl in the red dress who lies here, who made myflight from Frankfurt such fun. You didn't deserve this,'' the notesaid.   Officers hacked open the nose section of the plane, which lay onits side in a field, and troops carried away the bodies of the crew.   Fourteen adults and three children from Lockerbie remainedunaccounted for and there was no word on the occupants of three carshit by wreckage and gutted on a nearby highway, PoliceSuperintendent Angus Kennedy said.   The missing toll had been 22, but one man was found to have beentreated for injuries Wednesday and released, and another wasaccidentally listed twice as missing.   More than 600 troops and police, assisted by rescue experts anddogs, criss-crossed wide areas of the countryside looking for bodiesand any fragment that might help explain the crash.   An Air India jumbo jet bound for New York with 250 people aboardreturned to London on Friday afternoon after Air India in New Yorkreceived an anonymous bomb threat, officials said.   It was evacuated at Heathrow, but the airline announced nothingsuspicious was immiedately found. Passengers were offered seats on aflight today.</TEXT></DOC>
