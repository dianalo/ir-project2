Background </ITAG>The current framework of MDandamp;A was adopted in 1980,\2\<NOTE/> although the origins of the MDandamp;A requirements date to1968.\3\<NOTE/> MDandamp;A requires a discussion of liquidity, capital resources,results of operations, and other information necessary to an understandingof a registrant's financial condition, changes in financial condition andresults of operations.\4\<NOTE/> While the MDandamp;A requirements adopted in 1980 are far morecomprehensive than earlier formulations, they are intentionally general,reflecting the Commission's view that a flexible approach elicits moremeaningful disclosure and avoids boilerplate discussions, which a morespecific approach could foster. One year after adoption of the currentframework, the Commission published a release that included examples ofMDandamp;A disclosure to assist registrants.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Securities Act Release No. 6231 (September 2, 1980) [45FR 63630]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Securities Act Release No. 4936 (December 9, 1968) [33FR 18617]; Securities Act Release No. 5520 (August 14, 1974) [39 FR 31894].See also Securities Act Release No. 6711, <T3>supra</T3> n. 1, for a more detailed summary of the origins of theMDandamp;A requirements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 17 CFR 229.303(a). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Securities Act Release No. 6349 (September 28, 1981),23 SEC Docket 962 [not published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>]; <T3>see also </T3>Securities Act Release No. 6791 (August 1, 1988) [53FR 29226]. In 1986, Coopers andamp; Lybrand submitted to the Commission's Office ofthe Chief Accountant a proposal recommending increased MDandamp;A disclosureof business risks and the performance by the independent auditor of specifiedreview procedures with respect to these disclosures. Shortly thereafter,the managing partners of seven accounting firms \6\<NOTE/> issued a white paper entitled ``The Future Relevance, Reliability,and Credibility of Financial Information; Recommendations to the AICPABoard of Directors,'' which also called for increased risk disclosure,but contemplated that such disclosure would be separate from MDandamp;A andwould be subjected to audit coverage. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.; Arthur Young; Coopers andamp;Lybrand; Deloitte Haskins andamp; Sells; Ernst andamp; Whinney; Peat, Marwick,Mitchell andamp; Co.; and Touche Ross andamp; Co. The Commission thereafter issued the Concept Release requesting commentsconcerning the adequacy of the MDandamp;A requirements and the costs andbenefits of the revisions suggested by the proposals.\7\<NOTE/> Virtually all the 196 commentators opposed the proposalsinitiated by members of the accounting profession, and most took the positionthat there was no need to change the MDandamp;A requirements.\8\<NOTE/> A number of commentators, however, suggested that stricterenforcement and review, or additional guidance through an interpretiverelease, would improve compliance. Accordingly, the Division decided toundertake a special review of MDandamp;A disclosures to assess the adequacyof disclosure practices and to identify any common areas of deficiencies,with a view to providing further guidance on compliance with the requirementsof Item 303 of Regulation S-K and determining the need for revisions ofthe Item. Based on the results of the MDandamp;A review, the Commission concurswith the view expressed by most commentators that no amendments to theMDandamp;A requirements set forth in Regulation S-K are needed at this time.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Securities Act Release No. 6711, supra n. 1. In the ConceptRelease, the Commission indicated that much of the business risk disclosurerecommended in the Coopers andamp; Lybrand proposal is required by currentrules, although not necessarily by MDandamp;A. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The comments are available for inspection and copyingin the Commission's Public Reference Room at 450 5th Street, NW., Washington,DC [File No. S7-14-87]. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of the Project </ITAG>The staff commenced work on the MDandamp;A Project in early 1988. A totalof 218 companies in 12 industries were selected for review in the firstphase of this continuing project.\9\<NOTE/> Specific industries were chosen so that the staff, throughincreased familiarity and additional research, could enhance its expertiseregarding the industries. Each registrant was selected for an ``issuerreview'' that focused on the registrant rather than any one report filedunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'').\10\<NOTE/> Particular emphasis was placed on disclosures made in responseto the MDandamp;A requirements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The industries were: Miscellaneous Chemical Products;Retail-Grocery Stores; Airlines; Drugs; Real Estate Developers; NursingCare Facilities/Hospitals; Radio and Television Broadcasting/Cable Television;Textile Mill Products/Knitting Mills; Computer Hardware; Building Contractorsand Construction; Toys and Recreational Equipment; and Multi-segment Companies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ The most recent Form 10-K and subsequent reports filedunder the Exchange Act were given full reviews and the prior 10-K and interveningreports, as well as proxy and registration statements filed during theperiod, were examined for background information. Of the 218 registrants reviewed, 206 received letters of comment, manyof which related to more than one report. Three different categories ofcomments were issued: (a) Requests for amendment; (b) requests for supplementalinformation; and (c) requests for compliance in future filings (``futures''comments).\11\<NOTE/> Amendments were filed by 72 registrants in response to staffcomments. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Registrants received combinations of the above categoriesof comment. Many of the comment letters requested supplemental supportfor various presentations, and, in several instances, requests for amendmentswere revised to futures comments during the review process. Conversely,several amendments were requested after staff consideration of supplementalresponses provided by registrants. Compliance with futures comments isverified by staff review of subsequent filings. Work on a second phase of the MDandamp;A Project commenced in October 1988.A total of 141 companies in a second set of 12 industries \12\<NOTE/> were selected for review, resulting in 139 comment lettersbeing issued in December, 1988. To date, amendments by 53 registrants havebeen filed in response to staff comments. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The industries were: Banks; Savings and Loans; Meat Products;Dairy Products; Miscellaneous Plastic Products; Furniture; Radio and TelevisionCommunication Equipment and Apparatus; Research and Measurement Instruments;Industrial Machinery; Computer Software; Eating Places; and Motion Picture-TelevisionProduction. The amendments received in the first two phases principally addressed MDandamp;A,the business description required under Item 101 of Regulation S-K, andthe financial statements. More than one-half of the amendments substantivelyexpanded MDandamp;A, most often addressing one or more disclosure issuesas to which guidance is provided in this release.The Division has referred six registrants reviewed during the MDandamp;AProject to the Division of Enforcement due primarily to substantive accountingproblems which, in several instances, also affected the adequacy of theregistrants' MDandamp;As. The accounting problems encountered include, amongother things, possible inadequate maintenance of accounting records andsystems of internal controls and possible improper accounting regardingmaterial acquisitions.The staff has already begun a third phase of the MDandamp;A Project relatingto 12 new industries,\1\\3\<NOTE/> using the Forms 10-K recently filed for the fiscal year endedNovember 30, 1988 or later.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ The industries are: Retail-Department Stores; Retail-ApparelStores; Semiconductor and Related Devices; Crude Petroleum and NaturalGas; Railroads; Steel Works; Paper and Allied Products; Natural Gas Transmission;Lumber and Wood Products; Property-Casualty Insurance; Aircraft-AircraftEngines; and Newspapers-Publishing and Printing.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Evaluation of Disclosure_Interpretive Guidance</ITAG>A. IntroductionThe MDandamp;A requirements are intended to provide, in one section of afiling,\1\\4\<NOTE/> material historical and prospective textual disclosure enablinginvestors and other users to assess the financial condition and resultsof operations of the registrant, with particular emphasis on the registrant'sprospects for the future. As the Concept Release states:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ The MDandamp;A should contain a discussion of all thematerial impacts upon the registrant's financial condition or results ofoperations, including those arising from disclosure provided elsewherein the filing.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has long recognized the need for a narrative explanationof the financial statements, because a numerical presentation and briefaccompanying footnotes alone may be insufficient for an investor to judgethe quality of earnings and the likelihood that past performance is indicativeof future performance. MDandamp;A is intended to give the investor an opportunityto look at the company through the eyes of management by providing botha short and long-term analysis of the business of the company. The Itemasks management to discuss the dynamics of the business and to analyzethe financials.\1\\5\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ Securities Act Release No. 6711, supra n. 1, at 13717.As the Commission has stated, ``[i]t is the responsibility of managementto identify and address those key variables and other qualitative and quantitativefactors which are peculiar to and necessary for an understanding and evaluationof the individual company.'' \1\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ Securities Act Release No. 6349, supra n. 5, at 964.The Commission has determined that interpretive guidance is needed regardingthe following matters: prospective information required in MDandamp;A; longand short-term liquidity and capital resources analysis; material changesin financial statement line items; required interim period disclosure;MDandamp;A analysis on a segment basis; participation in high yield financings,highly leveraged transactions or non-investment grade loans and investments;the effects of federal financial assistance upon the operations of financialinstitutions; and preliminary merger negotiations.B. Prospective InformationSeveral specific provisions in Item 303 require disclosure of forward-lookinginformation. MDandamp;A requires discussions of ``known trends or any knowndemands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or thatare reasonably likely to result in the registrant's liquidity increasingor decreasing in any material way.'' \1\\7\<NOTE/> Further, descriptions of known material trends in the registrant'scapital resources and expected changes in the mix and cost of such resourcesare required.\1\\8\<NOTE/> Disclosure of known trends or uncertainties that the registrantreasonably expects will have a material impact on net sales, revenues,or income from continuing operations is also required.\1\\9\<NOTE/> Finally, the Instructions to Item 303 state that MDandamp;A``shall focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known tomanagement that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarilyindicative of future operating results or of future financial condition.''\2\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ 17 CFR 229.303(a)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ 17 CFR 229.303(a)(2)(ii).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ 17 CFR 229.303(a)(3)(ii).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ 17 CFR 229.303(a), Instruction 3. The data known tomanagement which may trigger required forward-looking disclosure is hereinafterreferred to as ``known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties.''The Project results confirm that the distinction between prospective informationthat is required to be discussed and voluntary forward-looking disclosureis an area requiring additional attention. This critical distinction isexplained in the Concept Release:<ITAG tagnum="21">Both required disclosure regarding the future impact of presentlyknown trends, events or uncertainties and optional forward-looking informationmay involve some prediction or projection. The distinction between thetwo rests with the nature of the prediction required. Required disclosureis based on <T3>currently known trends, events, and uncertainties that are reasonablyexpected to have material effects,</T3> such as: A reduction in the registrant'sproduct prices; erosion in the registrant's market share; changes in insurancecoverage; or the likely non-renewal of a material contract. In contrast,optional forward-looking disclosure involves <T3>anticipating a future trend or event or anticipating a less predictableimpact of a known event, trend or uncertainty.\2\\1\</T3><NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ Securities Act Release No. 6711, supra n. 1, at 13717(emphasis added).The rules establishing a safe harbor for disclosure of ``forward-lookingstatements'' define such statements to include statements of ``future economicperformance contained in'' MDandamp;A. These safe harbors apply to requiredstatements concerning the future effect of known trends, demands, commitments,events or uncertainties, as well as to optional forward-looking statements.\2\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ Rule 175(c) under the Securities Act of 1933 (``SecuritiesAct''), 17 CFR 230.175(c), and Rule 3b-6(c) under the Exchange Act, 17CFR 240.3b-6.A disclosure duty exists where a trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertaintyis both presently known to management and reasonably likely to have materialeffects on the registrant's financial condition or results of operation.\2\\3\<NOTE/> Registrants preparing their MDandamp;A disclosure should determineand carefully review what trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertaintiesare known to management. In the following example,\2\\4\<NOTE/> the registrant discloses the reasonably likely material effectson operating results of a known trend in the form of an expected furtherdecline in unit sales of mature products.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>Cf. In re American Savings and Loan Association of Florida,</T3> ExchangeAct Release No. 25788 (June 8, 1988), 41 SEC Docket 78. In this administrativeproceeding jointly conducted by the Commission and the Federal Home LoanBank Board (the ``FHLBB''), it was determined that the MDandamp;As in a Form10-K and two Forms 10-Q were inadequate under the FHLBB's disclosure requirements,which are substantially similar to the Commission's, for failing to disclose,among other matters, required forward-looking information regarding thepotential exposure and risks associated with repurchase transactions betweenAmerican Savings and Loan and E.S.M. Government Securities. <T3>Cf. also In re Burroughs Corporation,</T3> Exchange Act Release No.21872 (March 20, 1985), 32 SEC Docket (CCH) 935 (failure to discuss theimpact of inventory obsolescence); <T3>In re Marsh andamp; McClennan Companies, Inc.,</T3> Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 24023 (January 22, 1987), 37 SEC Docket (CCH) 634 (failure adequatelyto disclose, in a Form 10-K, the effects of a principal subsidiary's investingand financing activities).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ The examples used herein, while modeled in large partupon Project registrants' original or revised MDandamp;As, have been changedso that the registrants are not identified and particular points are emphasized.Of course, each example has been removed from its context as part of alarger document. The examples are provided for purposes of illustrationonly.<ITAG tagnum="21">While market conditions in general remained relatively unchanged in1987, unit volumes declined 10% as the Company's older products, representing40% of overall revenues, continue to approach the end of their life cycle.Unit volumes of the older products are expected to continue to decreaseat an accelerated pace in the future and materially adversely affect revenuesand operating profits.</ITAG>In preparing the MDandamp;A disclosure, registrants should focus on eachof the specific categories of known data. For example, Item 303(a)(2)(i)requires a description of the registrant's material ``commitments'' forcapital expenditures as of the end of the latest fiscal period. However,even where no legal commitments, contractual or otherwise, have been made,disclosure is required if material planned capital expenditures resultfrom a known demand, as where the expenditures are necessary to a continuationof the registrant's current growth trend. Similarly, if the same registrantdetermines not to incur such expenditures, a known uncertainty would existregarding continuation of the current growth trend. If the adverse effecton the registrant from discontinuation of the growth trend is reasonablylikely to be material, disclosure is required. Disclosure of planned materialexpenditures is also required, for example, when such expenditures arenecessary to support a new, publicly announced product or line of business.\2\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ <T3>See</T3> Item 101(c)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-K.In the following example, the registrant discusses planned capital expenditures,and related financing sources, necessary to maintain sales growth.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Company plans to open 20 to 25 new stores in fiscal 1988. As aresult, the Company expects the trend of higher sales in fiscal 1988 tocontinue at approximately the same rate as in recent years. Managementestimates that approximately $50 to $60 million will be required to financethe Company's cost of opening such stores. In addition, the Company's expansionprogram will require increases in inventory of about $1 million per store,which are anticipated to be financed principally by trade credit. Fundsrequired to finance the Company's store expansion program are expectedto come primarily from new credit facilities with the remainder providedby funds generated from operations and increased lease financings. TheCompany recently entered into a new borrowing agreement with its primarybank, which provides for additional borrowings of up to $50 million forfuture expansion. The Company intends to seek additional credit facilitiesduring fiscal 1988.</ITAG>Often a matter which had a material impact on past operating results alsoinvolves prospective effects which should be discussed.\2\\6\<NOTE/> In identifying the reason for a material change in incomefrom continuing operations and quantifying its effects, the registrantin the following example also describes the reasonably likely effect ofa known event: completion of an important contract.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ <T3>See, e.g., In re Charter Company,</T3> Exchange Act Release No. 21647(January 10, 1985), 32 SEC Docket (CCH) 289, in which the MDandamp;A in theregistrant's Form 10-K failed to disclose the favorable effect on earningsof the accounting method used, and the anticipated substantial reductionin future profits that would result from use of such method. <T3>Cf. SEC v. Baldwin-United Corporation,</T3> Litigation Release No.10878 (September 26, 1985) and <T3>In re Robert S. Harrison,</T3> Exchange Act Release No. 22466 (September26, 1985), 34 SEC Docket (CCH) 141 (both involving a different means ofaccounting for the same insurance product as in <T3>Charter,</T3> and Baldwin-United Corporation's failure to disclose,in the MDandamp;A of its Form 10-K, its failure to meet the earnings assumptionsof the accounting model used, and internal estimates of insufficient taxableincome to use tax benefits inherent in the earnings assumptions).<ITAG tagnum="21">The Company produced operating income of $22 million during 1987 ascompared to $15 million during 1986, a 47 percent increase. Substantiallyall of the 47 percent increase can be attributed to the Company's completionof a major contract at a cost less than anticipated. It is expected thatoperating income during the current year will be significantly less, asonly a portion of the profit generated by the completed contract is expectedto be replaced by new contracts as a result of a slowdown within the Company'sprincipal industry.</ITAG>Events that have already occurred or are anticipated often give rise toknown uncertainties. For example, a registrant may know that a materialgovernment contract is about to expire. The registrant may be uncertainas to whether the contract will be renewed, but nevertheless would be ableto assess facts relating to whether it will be renewed. More particularly,the registrant may know that a competitor has found a way to provide thesame service or product at a price less than that charged by the registrant,or may have been advised by the government that the contract may not berenewed. The registrant also would have factual information relevant tothe financial impact of non-renewal upon the registrant. In situationssuch as these, a registrant would have identified a known uncertainty reasonablylikely to have material future effects on its financial condition or resultsof operations, and disclosure would be required.In the following example, the registrant discloses the reasonably likelymaterial effect of a known uncertainty regarding implementation of recentlyadopted legislation.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Company had no firm cash commitments as of December 31, 1987 forcapital expenditures. However, in 1987, legislation was enacted which mayrequire that certain vehicles used in the Company's business be equippedwith specified safety equipment by the end of 1991. Pursuant to this legislation,regulations have been proposed which, if promulgated, would require theexpenditure by the Company of approximately $30 million over a three-yearperiod.</ITAG>Where a trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty is known, managementmust make two assessments:(1) Is the known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty likelyto come to fruition? If management determines that it is not reasonablylikely to occur, no disclosure is required.(2) If management cannot make that determination, it must evaluate objectivelythe consequences of the known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty,on the assumption that it will come to fruition. Disclosure is then requiredunless management determines that a material effect on the registrant'sfinancial condition or results of operations is not reasonably likely tooccur.\27\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ MDandamp;A mandates disclosure of specified forward-lookinginformation, and specifies its own standard for disclosure_<T3>i.e., </T3>reasonably likely to have a material effect. This specificstandard governs the circumstances in which Item 303 requires disclosure.The probability/magnitude test for materiality approved by the SupremeCourt in <T3>Basic, Inc., </T3>v. <T3>Levinson, </T3>108 S.Ct. 978 (1988), is inapposite to Item 303 disclosure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Each final determination resulting from the assessments made by managementmust be objectively reasonable, viewed as of the time the determinationis made.\2\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ Where a material change in a registrant's financialcondition (such as a material increase or decrease in cash flows) or resultsof operations appears in a reporting period and the likelihood of suchchange was not discussed in prior reports, the Commission staff as partof its review of the current filing will inquire as to the circumstancesexisting at the time of the earlier filings to determine whether the registrantfailed to discuss a known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertaintyas required by Item 303.Application of these principles may be illustrated using a common disclosureissue which was considered in the review of a number of Project registrants:designation as a potentially responsible party (``PRP'') by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (the ``EPA'') under The Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (``Superfund'').\2\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ 42 U.S.C. 9601, et seq. (1983 andamp; Supp. 1988).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Facts: </T3>A registrant has been correctly designated a PRP by theEPA with respect to cleanup of hazardous waste at three sites. No statutorydefenses are available. The registrant is in the process of preliminaryinvestigations of the sites to determine the nature of its potential liabilityand the amount of remedial costs necessary to clean up the sites. OtherPRPs also have been designated, but the ability to obtain contributionis unclear, as is the extent of insurance coverage, if any. Managementis unable to determine that a material effect on future financial conditionor results of operations is not reasonably likely to occur.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Based upon the facts of this hypothetical base, MDandamp;A disclosureof the effects of the PRP status, quantified to the extent reasonably practicable,would be required.\30\<NOTE/> For MDandamp;A purposes, aggregate potential cleanup costsmust be considered in light of the joint and several liability to whicha PRP is subject. Facts regarding whether insurance coverage may be contested,and whether and to what extent potential sources of contribution or indemnificationconstitute reliable sources of recovery may be factored into the determinationof whether a material future effect is not reasonably likely to occur.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Designation as a PRP does not in and of itself triggerdisclosure under Item 103 or Regulation S-K and Instruction 5 thereto,17 CFR 229.103, regarding ``Legal Proceedings,'' because PRP status alonedoes not provide knowledge that a governmental agency is contemplatinga proceeding. Nonetheless, a registrant's particular circumstances, whencoupled with PRP status, may provide that knowledge. While there are manyways a PRP can become subject to potential monetary sanctions, includingtriggering the stipulated penalty clause in a remedial agreement, the costsanticipated to be incurred under Superfund, pursuant to a remedial agreemententered into in the normal course of negotiation with the EPA, generallyare not ``sanctions'' within either Instruction 5 (B) or (C) to Item 103.Such remedial costs normally would constitute charges to income, or insome cases capital expenditures. The availability of insurance, indemnificationor constribution may be relevant under Instruction 5 (A) or (B) in determiningwhether the criteria for disclosure have been met. <T3>Thomas A. Cole, Esq., </T3>(January 17, 1989).C. Liquidity_CapitalResources  Instruction 2 to Item 303(a) calls for an evaluation of ``amounts and certaintyof cash flows.'' ``Except where it is otherwise clear from the discussion,''Item 303(a)(1) and instructions 2 and 5 to Item 303(a) together also mandateindication of which balance sheet conditions or income or cash flow itemsshould be considered in assessing liquidity, and a discussion of prospectiveinformation regarding the registrant's short and long-term sources of,and needs for, capital. Disclosure of material commitments for capitalexpenditures as of the end of the latest fiscal period is required by Item303(a)(2). Trend analysis and a description of ``any expected materialchanges in the mix and relative cost'' of the registrant's capital resourcesmust also be provided.\31\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Most registrants combine discussions of capital resourcesand liquidity as permitted by Item 303(a).<ITAG tagnum="28">When viewed to encompass capital resources, the Commission's conceptof liquidity is comparable to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's(``FASB'') concept of financial flexibility or the ability of an enterpriseto adjust its future cash flows to meet needs and opportunities, both expectedand unexpected. Financial flexibility is broader than the FASB's conceptof liquidity (defined as short-term nearness of assets and liabilitiesto cash) because it includes potential internal and external sources ofcash not directly associated with items shown on the balance sheet.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Securities Act Release No. 6349, </ITAG><T3>supra </T3>n. 5, at 972; see also Statement of Financial AccountingConcepts No. 5, <T3>Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises,andpara; 24a.</T3>Generally, short-term liquidity and short-term capital resources covercash needs up to 12 months into the future. These cash needs and the sourcesof funds to meet such needs relate to the day-to-day operating expensesof the registrant and material commitments coming due during that 12-monthperiod.  The discussion of long-term liquidity and long-term capital resources mustaddress material capital expenditures, significant balloon payments orother payments due on long-term obligations, and other demands or commitments,including any off-balance sheet items, to be incurred beyond the next 12months, as well as the proposed sources of funding required to satisfysuch obligations.\32\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>See, e.g., In re Hiex Development USA, Inc., </T3>Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 26722 (April 13, 1989), 43 SEC Docket (CCH) 1041 (involving in partthe registrant's failure to discuss in the MDandamp;A of a Form 10, a materialcontractual commitment to purchase equipment from an affiliate over a tenyear period).  Where a material deficiency in short or long-term liquidity has been identified,the registrant should disclose the deficiency, as well as disclosing eitherits proposed remedy, that it has not decided on a remedy, or that it iscurrently unable to address the deficiency.\33\<NOTE/> In the following example, a financially troubled registrantdiscusses the material effects of its cash flow problems on its business,and its efforts to remedy those problems.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ <T3>See, e.g., SEC v.

The Company's lenders have not declaredthe Company in default and have allowed the Company to remain in violationof these agreements. Were a default to be declared, the Company would notbe able to continue to operate. A capital infusion of $4,000,000 is necessaryto cure these defaults. The Company has engaged an investment banker andis considering various alternatives, including the sale of certain assetsor the sale of common shares, to raise these funds.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Company frequently has not been able to make timely payments toits trade and other creditors. As of year-end and as of February 29, 1988,the Company had past due payables in the amount of $525,000 and $705,000,respectively. Deferred payment terms have been negotiated with most ofthese vendors. However, certain vendors have suspended parts deliveriesto the Company. As a result, the Company was not always able to make allshipments on time, although no orders have been cancelled to date. Weresignificant volumes of orders to be cancelled, the Company's ability tocontinue to operate would be jeopardized. The Company is currently seekingsources of working capital financing sufficient to fund delinquent balancesand meet ongoing trade obligations.</ITAG>Short and long-term liquidity and capital resources analysis should becomemore comparable from registrant to registrant as a result of the FinancialAccounting Standards Board's recent issuance of SFAS 95,\3\\4\<NOTE/> which requires the statement of changes in financial positionto be replaced by a statement of cash flows as part of a full set of financialstatements.

Such interim period statements mustbe restated when presented as comparative prior periods with future interimfinancial statements.Registrants are expected to use the statement of cash flows, and otherappropriate indicators, in analyzing their liquidity, and to present abalanced discussion dealing with cash flows from investing and financingactivities as well as from operations. This discussion should address thosematters that have materially affected the most recent period presentedbut are not expected to have short or long-term implications, and thosematters that have not materially affected the most recent period presentedbut are expected materially to affect future periods.\3\\5\<NOTE/> Examples of such matters include: (a) Discretionary operatingexpenses such as expenses relating to advertising, research and developmentor maintenance of equipment; (b) debt refinancings or redemptions; or (c)levels of financing provided by suppliers or to customers. Liquidity analysispremised upon the new statement of cash flows and prepared in accordancewith this guidance should enhance the utility to investors of MDandamp;Adisclosure by improving comparability from registrant to registrant andproviding information more directly relevant to liquidity than that previouslypremised upon the statement of changes in financial position.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ See 17 CFR 229.303(a), Instruction 3; supra n. 17-30and accompanying text.D. Material ChangesSome Project registrants did not provide adequate disclosure of the reasonsfor material year-to-year changes in line items, or discussion and quantificationof the contribution of two or more factors to such material changes. Instruction4 to Item 303(a) requires a discussion of the causes of material changesfrom year-to-year in financial statement line items ``to the extent necessaryto an understanding of the registrant's businesses as a whole.'' An analysisof changes in line items is required where material and where the changesdiverge from changes in related line items of the financial statements,where identification and quantification of the extent of contribution ofeach of two or more factors is necessary to an understanding of a materialchange, or where there are material increases or decreases in net salesor revenue.\36\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ See SEC v.

The same Instruction alsostates that the discussion need not recite amounts of changes readily computablefrom the financial statement and ``shall not merely repeat numerical datacontained in'' such statements. However, quantification should otherwisebe as precise, including use of dollar amounts or percentages, as reasonablypracticable.In the following example, the registrant analyzes the reasons for a materialchange in revenues and in so doing describes the effects of offsettingdevelopments.<ITAG tagnum="21">Revenue from sales of single-family homes for 1987 increased 6% from1986. The increase resulted from a 14% increase in the average sales priceper home, partially offset by a 6% decrease in the number of homes delivered.Revenues from sales of single-family homes for 1986 increased 2% from 1985.The average sales price per home in 1986 increased 6%, which was offsetby a 4% decrease in the number of homes delivered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The increase in the average sales prices in 1987 and 1986 is primarilythe result of the Company's increased emphasis on higher priced single-familyhomes. The decrease in homes delivered in 1987 and 1986 was attributableto a decline in sales in Texas. The significant decline in oil prices andits resulting effect on energy-related business has further impacted thealready depressed Texas area housing market and is expected to do so forthe foreseeable future. The Company curtailed housing operations during1987 in certain areas in Texas in response to this change in the housingmarket. Although the number of homes sold is expected to continue to declineduring the current year as a result of this action, this decline is expectedto be offset by increases in average sales prices.</ITAG>E. Interim Period ReportingThe second sentence of Item 303(b) states that MDandamp;A relating to interimperiod financial statements ``shall include a discussion of material changesin those items specifically listed in paragraph (a) of this Item, exceptthat the impact of inflation and changing prices on operations for interimperiods need not be addressed.''38<NOTE/> As this sentence indicates, material changes to each andevery specific disclosure requirement contained in paragraph (a), withthe noted exception, should be discussed. This would include, for example,internal and external sources of liquidity, expected material changes inthe mix and relative cost of such resources, and unusual or infrequentevents or transactions that materially affected the amount of reportedincome from continuing operations.39<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>3817 CFR 229.303(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>39See, e.g., <T3>In re Amrerican Express Company, </T3> Exchange Act Release No. 23332(June 17, 1986), 35 SEC Docket (CCH) 1163 (failure to discuss the impact,in several Forms 10-Q and a Form 10-K, of two reinsurance transactionsby an insurance subsidiary which were treated by the registrant as materiallyincreasing net income, but which lacked economic substance); <T3>In re Michael R.

In light of the obligation to update MDandamp;A disclosure periodically,the impact of known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertaintiesarising during the interim period which are reasonably likely to have materialeffects on financial condition or results of operations constitutes requireddisclosure in MDandamp;A.40<NOTE/> For example, a calendar year end registrant describes, inits June 30 Form 10-Q, a recent event which is reasonably likely to havea material future effect on its financial condition or results of operations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>40See <T3>SEC</T3> v. <T3>Ronson Corporation,</T3> Litigation Release No. 10093 (August 15, 1983),28 SEC Docket (CCH) 841, where the MDandamp;As in a Form 10-K and two Forms10-Q were found to be inadequate in their failure to state that Ronson'slargest customer had shut down its operations which required purchasesfrom Ronson, that it was unlikely that this customer would resume purchasesin the short term and that, due to technological changes being made atthis customer's facilities, once purchases were resumed, an indefinitereduction in necessary purchases of 30-50% was likely.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Company was advised in late June that Company A, its principalcustomer, which accounted for 28% and 30% of revenues for the last sixmonths and prior fiscal year, respectively, intends to terminate all purchaseseffective during the third quarter, due to in-house capabilities recentlydeveloped by this customer. The Company is materially dependent on itsbusiness with this customer and anticipates upon such termination a materialadverse effect on revenues and income. Efforts are being made to replacerevenues attributable to such customer by developing new customers. TheCompany expects it will take at least 6 months to generate such replacementrevenues.</ITAG>F. Other Observations<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Segment Analysis</ITAG>In many cases, MDandamp;As of Project registrants with more than one segmentwere prepared on a segment as well as a consolidated basis. In formulatinga judgment as to whether a discussion of segment information is necessaryto an understanding of the business, a multi-segment registrant preparinga full fiscal year MDandamp;A should analyze revenues, profitability, andthe cash needs of its significant industry segments. To the extent anysegment contributes in a materially disproportionate way to those items,or where discussion on a consolidated basis would present an incompleteand misleading picture of the enterprise, segment discussion should beincluded. This may occur, for example, when there are legal or other restrictionsupon the free flow of funds from one segment, subsidiary or division ofthe registrant to others; when known trends, demands, commitments, eventsor uncertainties within a segment are reasonably likely to have a materialeffect on the business as a whole; when the ability to dispose of identifiedassets of a segment may be relevant to the financial flexibility of theregistrant; and in other circumstances in which the registrant concludesthat segment analysis is appropriate to an understanding of its business.41<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>41Registrants affected by Statement of Financial AccountingStandards No. 94, <T3>Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries,</T3> which requires,among other things, consolidation of non-homogeneous subsidiaries, shouldrecognize that segment analysis generally will be appropriate, inasmuchas the prior justification for not consolidating these operations was thatthey had different characteristics from those of the parent and its otheraffiliates. See id. at andpara;55 (recognizing that although the aggregation,of assets, liabilities and operations from non-homogeneous activities mayobscure important information about these activities, the disclosures requiredby Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14, <T3>Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise,</T3> canprovide meaningful information about the different operations within abusiness enterprise).The following example illustrates segment disclosure for a manufacturerwith two segments. The two segments contributed to operating income amountsthat were disproportionate to their respective revenues. The registrantdiscusses sales and operating income trends, factors explaining such trends,and where applicable, known events that will impact future results of operationsof the segment.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,i1,s25,10,10,10,10,10,10  </C><T4>Net Sales by Industry Segment</T4><H1>Industry segments</H1><H1>1987</H1><H2>($ million)</H2><H2>Percent of total</H2><H1>1986</H1><H2>($ million)</H2><H2>Percent of total</H2><H1>1985</H1><H2>($ million)</H2><H2>Percent of total</H2>    <ITAG tagnum="1">Segment I <D>585</D><D>55</D><D>479</D><D>53</D><D>420</D><D>48  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Segment II<D>472</D><D>45</D><D>433</D><D>47</D><D>457</D><D>52</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total sales<D>1057</D><D>100</D><D>912</D><D>100</D><D>877</D><D>100</D></ITAG></ITAG>  <ITAG tagnum="81">1987 vs. 1986  </ITAG>Segment I sales increased 22% in 1987 over the 1986 period. The increaseincluded the effect of the acquisition of Corporation T. Excluding thisacquisition, sales would have increased by 16% over 1986. Product LineA sales increased by 18% due to a 24% increase in selling prices, partiallyoffset by lower shipments. Product Line B sales increased by 35% due toa 17% increase in selling prices and a 15% increase in shipment volume. Segment II sales increased 9% due to a 12% increase in selling prices partlyoffset by a 3% reduction in shipment volumes.  <ITAG tagnum="81">1986 v. 1985  </ITAG>Segment I sales increased 14% in 1986. Product Line A sales increased 22%,in spite of a slight reduction in shipments, because of a 23% increasein selling prices.  Product Line B sales declined 5% due mainly to a 7% decrease in sellingprices, partially offset by higher shipments.  The 5% decline in Segment II sales reflected a 3% reduction in sellingprices and a 2% decline in shipments.  The substantial increases in selling prices of Product Line A during 1987and 1986 occurred primarily because of heightened worldwide demand whichexceeded the industry's production capacity. The Company expects theseconditions to continue for the next several years. The Company anticipatesthat shipment volumes of Product Line A will increase as its new productionfacility reaches commercial production levels in 1988.  Segment II shipment volumes have declined during the past two years primarilybecause of the discontinuation of certain products which were marginallyprofitable and did not have significant growth potential.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,i1,s25,10,10,10,10,10,10  </C><T4>Operating Profit by Industry Segment</T4><H1>Industry segments</H1><H1>1987</H1><H2>($ million)</H2><H2>Percent of total</H2><H1>1986</H1><H2>($ million)</H2><H2>Percent of total</H2><H1>1985</H1><H2>($ million)</H2><H2>Percent of total</H2>    <ITAG tagnum="1">Segment I <D>126</D><D>75</D><D>108</D><D>68</D><D>67</D><D>55  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Segment II<D>42</D><D>25</D><D>51</D><D>32</D><D>54</D><D>45</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Operating profit<D>168</D><D>100</D><D>159</D><D>100</D><D>121</D><D>100</D></ITAG></ITAG>  <ITAG tagnum="81">1987 vs. 1986   </ITAG>Segment I operating profit was $18 million (17%) higher in 1987 than in1986.

Partially offsetting theseincreases are costs and expenses of $11 million related to new plant start-up,slightly reduced margins on Product Line B sales and a $9 million increasein research and development expenses.  Segment II operating profit declined $9 million (18%) due mainly to substantiallyhigher costs in 1987 resulting from a 23% increase in average raw materialcosts which could not be fully recovered through sales price increases.The Company expects that Segment II margins will continue to decline, althoughat a lesser rate than in 1987 as competitive factors limit the Company'sability to recover cost increases.  <ITAG tagnum="81">1986 vs. 1985  </ITAG>Segment I operating profit was $41 million (61%) higher in 1986 than in1985. After excluding the effect of the $23 million non-recurring chargefor the early retirement program in 1985, Segment I operating profit in1986 was $18 million (27%) higher than in 1985. This increase reflectedhigher prices and a corresponding 21% increase in margins on Product LineA, and a 17% increase in margins on Product Line B due primarily to costreductions resulting from the early retirement program.  Segment II operating profit declined about $3 million (6%) due mainly tolower selling prices and slightly reduced margins in 1986.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Participation in High Yield Financings, Highly Leveraged Transactionsor Non-Investment Grade Loans and Investments</ITAG>A registrant, whether a financial institution (such as a bank, thrift,insurance company or finance company), broker-dealer or one of its affiliates,or any other public company, may participate in several ways, directlyor indirectly, in high yield financings, or highly leveraged transactionsor make non-investment grade loans or investments relating to corporaterestructurings such as leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations including significantstock buybacks and cash dividends, and acquisitions or mergers.\42\<NOTE/> A registrant may participate in the financing of such a transactioneither as originator, syndicator, lender, purchaser, or secured seniordebt, or as an investor in other debt instruments (often unsecured or subordinated),redeemable preferred stock or other equity securities. Participation inhigh yield or highly leveraged transactions, as well as investment in non-investmentgrade securities, generally involves greater returns, in the form of higherfees and higher average yields or potential market gains. Participationin such transactions may involve greater risks, often related to creditworthiness, solvency, relative liquidity of the secondary trading market,potential market losses, and vulnerability to rising interest rates andeconomic downturns.\43\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ On February 16, 1989 the Federal Reserve Board issuedbank examination guidelines regarding highly leveraged transactions. Letterfrom William Taylor, Director, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation,to the Officer in Charge of Supervision at each Federal Reserve Bank (February16, 1989). The guidelines are intended to assist bank examiners in identifyingexposures that may warrant closer scrutiny and are not intended to implycriticism of any particular transaction, nor to suggest what is deemedto be an appropriate degree of leverage in any particular industry. Inthese guidelines, criteria to define a highly leveraged financing includeidentification of borrowers whose debt to total assets ratio exceeds 75%.Registrants may refer to this guidance or to other recognized criteriathat may be developed in defining highly leveraged transactions. In anyevent, registrants should indicate how highly leveraged transactions aredefined for disclosure purposes. In this regard, the Commission recognizesthat leverage characteristics may vary from industry to industry, and thatdebt ratios that are appropriate for some industries may be unusually highor low in other industries. Similarly, the Commission does not intend toimply criticism of any particular transaction or to suggest an appropriatedegree of leverage in any particular industry or for any particular firm.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>P. Asquith, D. Mullins, Jr., and E. Wolff, OriginalIssue High Yield Bonds: Aging Analyses of Defaults, Exchanges, and Calls(March, 1989).Similar risk-reward exposure appears to exist when the growing practiceby certain registrants of originating low down-payment mortgages withoutobtaining mortgage insurance. Other registrants have substantial participationin venture capital financings.In view of these potentially greater returns and potentially greater risks,disclosure of the nature and extent of a registrant's involvement withhigh yield or highly leveraged transactions and non-investment grade loansand investments may be required under one or more of several MDandamp;A items,and registrants should consider carefully the extent of disclosure required.\4\\4\<NOTE/> MDandamp;A analysis is required if such participation has hador is reasonably likely to have a material effect on financial conditionor results of operations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\Other related disclosure includes Schedule 1 of Rule12-02 of Regulation S-X, 17 CFR 210.12-02, which requires separate disclosurefor each particular issue of corporate securities carried on the balancesheet at greater than 2% of total assets, and allows reasonable groupings,<T3>e.g., </T3>by similar investment risk, of all other securities. Also,for securities with significantly greater investment risk factors thanare typical for that class of issuer, such as securities where interestis in default or the issuer is in bankruptcy, separate listing or groupingis required to be accompanied by a brief description of the relevant riskfactors. Guide 3, Item III(c)(4) requires bank holding companies to discloseconcentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans, and defines ``concentration''to exist where a number of borrowers are engaged in similar activitiesthat would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions.Item II of Guide 3 instructs that consideration should be given to disclosureof the risk characteristics of securities held as investments. Savingsand loan holding companies should provide similar disclosures pursuantto Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 11:K. Insurance companies are also subjectto similar requirements under Article 7 of Regulation S-X, Rule 7-03(a)(1),Notes 5-6, 17 CFR 210.7-03(a)(1). In determining the adequacy of disclosure concerning participation in highyield, highly leveraged and non-investment grade loans and investments,registrants should consider the need to disclose: 1. Relevant lending and investing policies, including credit and risk managementpolicies; 2. The amounts of holdings, stated separately by type if individually material,including guarantees and repurchase or other commitments to lend or acquiresuch loans and investments, and the potential risks inherent in such holdings;3. Information regarding the level of activity during the period, <T3>e.g., </T3>originations and retentions; 4. Amounts of holdings, if any, giving rise to significantly greater risks(that may have material effects on financial condition or results of operations)than are present in other similar transactions and instruments; for example,where the issuer is bankrupt or has issued securities on which interestpayments are in default, or where there are significant concentrations(<T3>e.g., </T3>in an individual borrower, industry or geographic area),particularly where those concentrations are in securities with relativelylow trading market liquidity (such as those that depend upon a single marketmaker for their liquidity); and 5. Analysis of the actual and reasonably likely material effects of theabove matters on income and operations, <T3>e.g., </T3>the amounts of fees recognized and deferred, yields, amountsof realized and unrealized market gains or losses, and credit losses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Such disclosure may appear in the business discussion, or other appropriatelocation, but the effects resulting from participation should be analyzedin MDandamp;A. Similar concerns are raised with regard to investment companies that invest,or are permitted to invest, all or a portion of their portfolios in high-yieldor non-investment grade securities. An investment company that seeks highincome by investing in other than high-grade bonds (or is permitted todo so, even if it does not currently include such securities in its portfolio)should disclose in its prospectus the risks involved in such investments.\4\\5\<NOTE/> These risks include, but are not limited to, the risks describedabove, such as market price volatility based upon interest rate sensitivity,creditworthiness and relative liquidity of the secondary trading market,as well as the effects such risks may have on the net asset value of thefund. In addition, the board of directors of a fund that invests in suchsecurities should carefully consider factors affecting the secondary marketfor such securities in determining whether or not any particular securityis liquid or illiquid, and whether market quotations are ``readily available''for purposes of valuing portfolio securities.\4\\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\<T3>See </T3>Guide 20 to Form N-1A. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\<T3>See </T3>Guide 28 to Form N-1A. The nature of disclosure required by non-investment companies will varydepending on the type of participation. In the following example the registrantis a bank holding company that participates in highly leveraged transactionsas a lender and not as an investor. <ITAG tagnum="21">The Company is active in originating and syndicating loans in highlyleveraged corporate transactions. The Company generally includes in thiscategory domestic and international loans and commitments made by the Banksin recapitalizations, acquisitions, and leveraged buyouts which resultin the borrower's debt to total assets ratio exceeding 75%. As of December31, 1988, the Company had loans outstanding in approximately 61 highlyleveraged transactions in an aggregate principal amount of approximately$900 million, was committed under definitive loan agreements relating toapproximately 23 highly leveraged transactions to lend an additional amountof approximately $650 million, and had other highly leveraged transactionsat various stages of discussion or preliminary commitment. The Company'sequity investments in highly leveraged transactions are not material. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In recent years the Company has not made a loan in excess of $175million in any individual highly leveraged transaction, and the Companyhas typically retained, after syndication and sales of loan participations,a principal amount not exceeding approximately $35 million in any suchtransaction. At December 31, 1988, only two loans had outstanding balancesexceeding $35 million ($51 million and $47 million, respectively) and noindustry represented more than 15% of the Company's total highly leveragedloan portfolio. Should an economic downturn or sustained period of risinginterest rates occur, highly leveraged transaction borrowers may experiencefinancial stress. As a result, risks associated with these transactionsmay be higher than for more traditional financing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Company estimates that its fees for lending and corporate financeactivities relating to highly leveraged transactions were approximately$64 million during 1988, of which approximately $48 million was recognizedas income and $16 million was deferred, compared with $40 million during1987 of which approximately $32 million was recognized as income and $8million was deferred. The deferred portion of such fees will be recognizedover the terms of the related loans in accordance with Statement of FinancialAccounting Standards Number 91. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In recent years, the Company has had no significant charge-offs ofloans made in highly leveraged transactions. At December 31, 1988, approximately$25 million (3%) of such outstanding loans were on nonaccrual status, whichwas not materially greater than that for the Company's other lending activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A reduction in the Company's activities relating to highly leveragedtransactions could have some negative impact on the Company's results ofoperations. The size of such impact would depend on the magnitude of thereduction and on the profitability of the activities to which the Companymight redirect its resources. Although any estimate of the impact of atotal discontinuation of all new highly leveraged transactions dependson various factors that cannot now be determined, the Company believesthat such a discontinuation would reduce its gross revenues approximately6% and net income by approximately 12%. </ITAG>In the following example, the registrant is an investor in non-investmentgrade debt securities.<ITAG tagnum="21">At December 31, 1988, the Company held in its portfolio, net of reserves,$81 million of high yield, unrated or less than investment grade corporatedebt securities with an aggregate market value of $75 million. Investmentsin unrated or less than investment grade corporate debt securities havedifferent risks than other investments in corporate debt securities ratedinvestment grade and held by the Company. Risk of loss upon default bythe borrower is significantly greater with respect to such corporate debtsecurities than with other corporate debt securities because these securitiesare generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors ofthe issuer, and because these issuers usually have high levels of indebtednessand are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as recessionor increasing interest rates, than are investment grade issuers. In addition,investments by the Company in corporate debt securities of any given issuerare generally larger than its investments in most other securities, thusresulting in a greater impact in the event of default. There is only athinly traded market for such securities and recent market quotations arenot available for some of these securities. Market quotes are generallyavailable only from a limited number of dealers and may not represent firmbids of such dealers or prices for actual sales.

Effects of Federal Financial Assistance Upon Operations</ITAG>Many financial institutions, such as thrifts and banks, are receiving financialassistance in connection with federally assisted acquisitions or restructurings.Such assistance may take various forms and is intended to make the survivingfinancial institution a viable entity. Examples of such methods of assistanceinclude: (a) Yield maintenance assistance (which guarantees additionalinterest on specified interest bearing assets, a level of return on specifiednon-interest-bearing assets, reimbursement if covered assets are ultimatelycollected or sold for amounts that are less than a specified amount, orany combination therof); (b) indemnification against certain loss contingencies;(c) the purchase of equity securities issued by the institution for cashor a note receivable from the federal agency; and (d) arrangements designedto insulate the surviving entity from the economic effects of problem assetsacquired from the predecessor financial institution (such as a ``put agreement''whereby the surviving institution may ``put'' troubled loans directly orindirectly to the federal agency at higher than their fair value).If these or any other types of federal financial assistance have materiallyaffected, or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect upon,financial condition or results of operations, the MDandamp;A should providedisclosure of the nature, amounts, and effects of such assistance.\4\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\For a related discussion of the accounting treatmentand financial statement disclosure of federal assistance associated withregulatory-assisted acquisitions of banking and thrift institutions, see<T3>EITF Abstracts, </T3>Issue No. 88-19.In the following example, a financial institution discloses the materialeffects of a federally assisted corporate reorganization. Such disclosurewas in addition to various disclosures of the existence and effect of suchfederal assistance in the description of business portions of the filing(pursuant to Industry Guide 3) and in the registrant's financial statements.<ITAG tagnum="21">During 1988, earnings for the Company included $60 million of assistanceincome, including (a) $10 million in indemnity from the Federal Agencyin respect of litigation costs associated with the Company's predecessorand (b) $50 million related to the 1988 puts of troubled loans to the FederalAgency under the Company's Put Agreement. The assistance income arisesfrom provisions in the Reorganization agreements that are intended to relievethe Company from the adverse economic effects of litigation and problemassets held by its predecessor. These provisions are intended to placethe Company in substantially the same position as if such litigation andproblem assets had been assumed by the Federal Agency at the time of theReorganization. Based on existing economic circumstances, management believesthat the expiration of the Put Agreement in June 1989 may adversely affectfuture operations including an increased level of non-performing loansand loan loss provisions which cannot be recovered pursuant to the PutAgreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">4. Preliminary Merger Negotiations </ITAG>While Item 303 could be read to impose a duty to disclose otherwise nondisclosedpreliminary merger negotiations, as known events or uncertainties reasonablylikely to have material effects on future financial condition or resultsof operations, the Commission did not intend to apply, and has not applied,Item 303 in this manner.\48\<NOTE/> As reflected in the various disclosure requirements underthe Securities Act and Exchange Act that specifically address merger transactions,the Commission historically has balanced the informational need of investorsagainst the risk that premature disclosure \49\<NOTE/> of negotiations may jeopardize completion of the transaction.\50\<NOTE/> In general, the Commission's recognition that registrantshave an interest in preserving the confidentiality of such negotiationsis clearest in the context of a registrant's continuous reporting obligationsunder the Exchange Act, where disclosure on Form 8-K of acquisitions ordispositions of assets not in the ordinary course of business is triggeredby completion of the transaction.\51\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Brief for the Securities and Exchange Commission asAmicus Curiae at 7 and note 3, <T3>Basic, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>Levinson, supra</T3> n. 27; <T3>In the Matter of Carnation Company,</T3> Exchange Act Release No. 22214(July 8, 1985), 33 SEC Docket (CCH) 874. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ <T3>See Basic, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>Levinson, supra</T3> n. 27, at 985 (``Arguments based on the premisethat some disclosure would be `premature' in a sense are more properlyconsidered under the rubric of an issuer's duty to disclose.

Filings, including periodic reportsunder the Exchange Act that contain annual or interim financial statementsare required to reflect the prescribed accounting treatment as of the measurementdate. In contrast, where a registrant registers securities for sale under theSecurities Act, the Commission requires disclosure of material probableacquisitions and dispositions of businesses, including the financial statementsof the business to be acquired or sold.\52\<NOTE/> Where the proceeds from the sale of the securities beingregistered are to be used to finance an acquisition of a business, theregistration statement must disclose the intended use of proceeds. Again,accommodating the need for confidentiality of negotiations, registrantsare specifically permitted not to disclose in registration statements theidentity of the parties and the nature of the business sought if the acquisitionis not yet probable and the board of directors determines that the acquisitionwould be jeopardized.\53\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ Article 11 of Regulation S-X, 17 CFR 210.11-01 <T3>et seq.</T3> (generally requiring the provision of pro forma financialinformation where a significant acquisition or disposition ``has occurredor is probable'').

Item 13 of Form 10, 17 CFR 249.210. <T3>See also</T3> Item 14 of Schedule 14A, 17 CFR 240.14a-101 (requiringArticle 11 pro forma financial information and extensive other informationabout certain extraordinary transactions if shareholder action is to betaken with respect to such a transaction). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ Item 504 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.504, Instruction6. The Commission's interpretation of Item 303, as applied to preliminarymerger negotiations, incorporates the same policy determinations. Accordingly,where disclosure is not otherwise required, and has not otherwise beenmade, the MDandamp;A need not contain a discussion of the impact of suchnegotiations where, in the registrant's view, inclusion of such informationwould jeopardize completion of the transaction. Where disclosure is otherwiserequired or has otherwise been made by or on behalf of the registrant,the interests in avoiding premature disclosure no longer exist. In suchcase, the negotiations would be subject to the same disclosure standardsunder Item 303 as any other known trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty.These policy determinations also would extend to preliminary negotiationsfor the acquisition or disposition of assets not in the ordinary courseof business. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion </ITAG>In preparing MDandamp;A disclosure, registrants should be guided by the generalpurpose of the MDandamp;A requirements: to give investors an opportunityto look at the registrant through the eyes of management by providing ahistorical and prospective analysis of the registrant's financial conditionand results of operations, with particular emphasis on the registrant'sprospects for the future. The MDandamp;A requirements are intentionally flexibleand general. Because no two registrants are identical, good MDandamp;A disclosurefor one registrant is not necessarily good MDandamp;A disclosure for another.The same is true for MDandamp;A disclosure of the same registrant in differentyears. The flexibility of MDandamp;A creates a framework for providing themarketplace with appropriate information concerning the registrant's financialcondition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. The ``Codification of Financial Reporting Policies'' announced in FinancialReporting Release 1 (April 15, 1982) [47 FR 21028] is updated:      1.
