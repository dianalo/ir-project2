West Germany's majoropposition party also called for unity.   In East Germany, a Communist newspaper warned that society couldcollapse unless authorities stem emigration and punish corruptofficials. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in five citiesMonday night in what has become a weekly ritual to maintainpressure on the ruling Communists to enact reforms.   One of the biggest cheers among the 200,000 demonstrators inLeipzig came when a speaker urged a referendum on German unity.   East Germany's leaders oppose reunification, but a proposedconfederation is being discussed. The government in East Berlin wasexpected to issue a statement on Kohl's remarks later today.   Kohl's 30-minute address to Parliament was the most thoroughdelineation of his vision of eliminating the partition imposed atthe end of World War II.   In a 10-point plan, he proposed taking steps to ``developconfederative structures between the two states in Germany in orderto create a federation, a federal order.''   He stressed, however, that such measures could only beundertaken if there are free elections in East Germany that includenon-socialist parties. East Germany's new Communist leaders havesaid such elections could be held as early as next fall.   Kohl also said steps toward German reunification must be linkedto improved East-West relations and a new European order based oncooperation, economic integration and greater freedom of movement.   ``The future structure of Germany must fit into the wholearchitecture of Europe as a whole,'' he said.   Kohl suggested the creation of consultative committees with EastGermany, including a joint parliamantary panel.   ``Such a coming together is in the interest of the continuationof German history,'' Kohl said.   Earlier, Hans-Jochen Vogel, the leader of the opposition SocialDemocrats, proposed a confederation between the German states as aninterim step toward unity. He also insisted German unity come aspart of the process of overall European integration.   Vogel used the word ``unity'' rather than formal``reunification'' in his speech to Parliament.   In the past, the Social Democrats have cautioned againsthastening toward reunification, and some in the leftist party haveopposed it.   The ZDF television network said Kohl gave no dates for thecompletion of his plan in an earlier talk with governing partylawmakers. Kohl has previously said he envisions a reunited Germanyexisting peacefully with its neighbors and other countries.   The newspaper Bild said Kohl's plan includes setting up jointcommittees to coordinate cooperation in economic matters, crimeprevention, ecology and other domestic areas, while ``leavingmembership to NATO and the Warsaw Pact untouched.''   Government spokesman Hans Klein said Kohl may travel to EastGermany on Dec. 19 for talks on his proposals. Leaders of bothGermanys are under pressure to keep the reunification option open.   At the Leipzig rally, placards said ``Germany United _Fatherland,'' and at one point some demonstrators chanted theslogan. Another banner read, ``The Goal _ One Germany.''   One of the biggest cheers came when a worker, Helmut Neubert,called for a referendum on German reunification.   ``The fundamental question of reunification cannot be only amatter for politicans. The people must decide whether they wantit,'' he said.   West Germany's ultra-rightist Republican party issued anelection platform Monday calling for a reunited Germany that wouldinclude territory lost in World War II.   Such calls deeply disturb Poland, where most of that territoryis located, and Kohl has sought to reassure the Poles that areunified Germany would have no designs on those lands.   In addition to the Leipzig protest, tens of thousands ofprotesters took to the streets Monday night in Dresden and Halle,while 10,000 people protested in the city of Schwerin, the officialEast German news agency ADN said.   Under the pressure of a public demanding an end to 40 years ofauthoritarian one-party rule, East Germany has undergone dizzyingchanges since party chief Erich Honecker was ousted Oct. 18 andreplaced by Egon Krenz.   On Nov. 9, the Berlin Wall was opened and East Germans wereallowed to travel freely for the first time.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy today placed two white lilies at the cityhall site of his brother's dramatic 1963 speech. President Kennedysaid at the time, ``Ich bin ein Berliner,'' as a measure ofsolidarity with residents of the divided city.   Kennedy, D-Mass., said the opening of the wall sparked ``thegreatest march of liberty in modern times.'' He later visited EastBerlin.   A front-page editorial in Berliner Zeitung, a Communist Partynewspaper, called for more action to punish suspected widespreadcorruption under the leadership of ousted party chief ErichHonecker.   ``Every day that goes by without true signs (of such action)being given leads toward the collapse of society,'' the editorialsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
