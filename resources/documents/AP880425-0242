Lady Sabrina, whose church is open to the public on Fridaynights, says she never heard of Charles Arnold, but that does notsurprise her.   ``For a while a woman in Salem, Mass., who was picketing themovie `Witches of Eastwick' became very well known. Since there isno central organization, whoever makes the most noise becomes themost prominent witch.''   Arnold, a soft-spokeman man with a beard, says he was initiatedas a priest in witchcraft traditions dating back thousands of years.   Each coven, grove or temple chooses its own rituals and vows.Some covens meet in the nude, but Arnold's group prefers robes.   He offered this description of a Wiccan wedding:   Inside a magical circle, the male and female divinities aresummoned along with the guardians of the four elements _ air,water, fire and earth.   The groom's left hand is bound to the bride's right hand andsome choose to draw blood from their skin and touch like bloodbrothers.   Couples exchange rings, bracelets or floral crowns; step overflames for purification and fertility, and jump over a broom tosymbolize household unity.   Traditional gifts include bread (for plenty), silver(prosperity), salt (health) and wood or coal (physical andemotional warmth).   Before the priest pronounces them husband and wife, he invokesthe couple ``to pleasure one another,'' Arnold says. ``We don't cutsex off from the rest of life. We don't make a big thing out of iteither.''   At the heart of the primitive religion lies the power of themale and female in nature, symbolized by the god usually referredto by the Celtic name Herne, and the goddess known as Cerridwen orAthena or Isis, Arnold said.   Wiccans also believe in the mysteries of magic, reincarnationand in celebrating the rites of passage, such as first menstruationand menopause.   ``We go through life after life to learn and evolve and progressto the point where we rejoin the god and goddess,'' Arnold says.``Behind them, there is something we can't even identify, the unitythey come from.''   Witches don't go around laying curses on people, and they don'tconduct human or animal sacrifices, eat babies or worship the devilas depicted in folklore and comics, he said.   But the craft does have a practical side.   ``I mix up potions and my wife makes some of the finest liqueursyou've ever tasted,'' Arnold says. ``I use wormwood and calendula(a rare herb) in vinegar to take bruises away and lavender vinegarfor sunburn.''   Arnold says he discovered his religion 10 years ago afterintuitively constructing a Wiccan altar in his home. A woman he wasdating happened to be a witch and was startled to see the altar.   Leader of the 50-member Temple of the Elder Faiths in Toronto,Arnold was raised in New Jersey by a grandmother who read tealeaves.   ``We believe that if you are meant to find the craft, youwill,'' he says. ``Many traditional Wiccans think we're growing toofast and this will water down the religion and may actually destroyit.''   He said covens usually meet on eight sabbaths coinciding withthe year's solar and lunar cycles. The average age in his group is27 and members include a real estate agent, a schoolteacher and anaturopath.   ``Covens are closer than most families. Members tend to be moreimaginative than most people and a little bit eccentric,'' saidArnold, a published poet and expert on ritual body decoration.</TEXT><TEXT>   ``I want to come back in my next life as Fred Astaire.
