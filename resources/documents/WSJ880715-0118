Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><TEXT>   This isn't the way the Rainbow was supposed to end.    Ron Walters, one of Jesse Jackson's closest advisers, first got suspicious Monday night. Driving home from Mr. Jackson's vice-presidential interview with Paul Brountas of the Dukakis campaign, Mr. Walters heard a radio story out of Boston that Mr. Jackson had declined to fill out certain financial forms for Mr. Brountas.    &quot;It was true, yes,&quot; Mr. Walters says, suggesting that someone in the Dukakis campaign had leaked the news. &quot;But I thought this process was supposed to be confidential.&quot; Then within hours Michael Dukakis named Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate. &quot;It really calls into question for me the seriousness of that meeting,&quot; says Mr. Walters.    Even if Gov. Dukakis really did want to inform Mr. Jackson about Sen. Bentsen, he sure doesn't want to talk to him about much else. Instead of having a veto over the vice-presidential choice, Mr. Jackson wasn't even asked for his views. No one consulted him about next week's convention keynoter, Ann Richards, either. His 13 platform amendments aren't likely to get much time for debate, much less be adopted. And party chairman Paul Kirk never bothered to call him at all on Tuesday, Mr. Jackson's aides say, though he could find the time to fly to Boston to extol Mr. Bentsen.    If all this sounds like a snub, it probably is. And it's probably also the result of careful calculation. Mr. Jackson has said he wants a revolution in the Democratic Party, but this year the Democrats don't seem to think a revolutionary message can win. The Democrats, or at least Michael Dukakis, may even be serious about winning for a change.    Mr. Jackson's aides insist, of course, that he has mobilized millions of voters whose support is crucial if Mr. Dukakis is going to defeat George Bush -- 20 million &quot;blacks, workers, farmers, women and Hispanics,&quot; says Mr. Walters. But Mr. Dukakis's advisers may also be looking at the primary season's exit polls, and those numbers tell a different story.    Instead of new voters, nine of 10 Jackson voters had voted for Democrats in 1984, according to exit polls analyzed by ABC News. And while Mr. Jackson did do better among white voters this time, most of those were &quot;liberal, upscale, well-educated&quot; voters, according to both CBS and ABC. The man who preached economic populism actually became the candidate of the guilty upper class.    Rather than pursue the Rainbow Coalition, the Dukakis campaign seems prepared to target the &quot;Reagan Democrats.&quot; Mostly Northern ethnics and Southern white males, these voters abandoned the Democrats for their persistent liberalism. &quot;We finally have a nominee who came to the same conclusion I did that you have to win with 'swing voters' and not with the liberals and party activists,&quot; says Al From of the Democratic Leadership Council, which has been trying to move the Democratic Party back to the center.    It would be disastrous if Mr. Dukakis lost black voters in the process, but that prospect seems doubtful. Over the past 20 years blacks have become the Democrats' most loyal voting bloc; blacks now aren't a &quot;swing&quot; constituency but part of the Democratic base. A Republican message like Rep. Jack Kemp's would make inroads, but the effort would take years, not a single campaign. As for black turnout, Patrick Reddy and Christopher Collins report in Public Opinion magazine that from 1980 to 1984 the black share of the electorate climbed by 13%, but Ronald Reagan's victory margin doubled in any case.    More important than arithmetic, however, is Mr. Jackson's message. Speaking to black aspirations, he represents the best of the American dream. He might even qualify as a social conservative if not for his endorsement of homosexual rights.    But married to that vision is also a message of resentment, even of class warfare. In the U.S. economy, he sees only &quot;barracudas&quot; eating &quot;small fish,&quot; and &quot;reverse Robin Hood.&quot; Abroad, he sees only American errors and scarcely any foreign menace.    Even liberals can agree that this is not a winning message in a time of peace and the lowest unemployment rate in 14 years.    By late this week Mr. Jackson and his aides were saber-rattling, having broken off talks on the platform and the like. But by calling in former President Carter to mediate, he was also showing just how little incentive he has for a full-blown confrontation. Mr. Dukakis might even relish a debate on the platform -- over Mr. Jackson's proposals to raise taxes or freeze defense spending -- since he could continue to play the centrist by comparison. Mr. Jackson also knows he would be blamed for any convention turmoil if Mr. Dukakis were to lose in November.    Speaking this week about the convention, Mr. Jackson also hinted that he might have his name placed in nomination for vice president, just as Estes Kefauver did to defeat Jack Kennedy in 1956. But a better historical analogy may be 1948. That's the year Harry Truman fought off the left-wing charge of Henry Wallace, and later went on to defeat Republican Thomas Dewey. Gov. Dukakis is too isolationist to warrant comparison with the hawkish Harry, but Mr. Jackson is very much in the tradition of Mr. Wallace. </TEXT></DOC>
