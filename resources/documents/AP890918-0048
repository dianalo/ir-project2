(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. Census Bureau plans to hire thehomeless to count the homeless during next year's census, accordingto a regional official.   Ben Arzu, coordinator of the census-awareness program for theregional census center, said officials hoped that by hiring thehomeless they'll get a more accurate count.   ``The details of the training are not worked out yet,'' Arzusaid. ``But we would like to hire people living in shelters to dothe actual enumeration. They probably have more experience infinding the homeless than others would.''   Arzu said about 60 homeless people would be hired throughout themetropolitan area for the task.   The special census will be conducted the night of March 20 atshelters, on the streets and in abandoned buildings.   He said the census-takers would not actually enter abandonedbuildings.   ``The enumeration will be done outside buildings, as people comeout'' in the morning, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
