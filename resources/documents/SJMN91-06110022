We wanted to have a deal before the draft.&quot;;    The value of thecontract was not available, but Policy said both two- and three-year dealswere discussed. Neither Young nor his agent, Leigh Steinberg, could be reachedfor comment.;    Signing Young, 29, actually could make him more attractivefor a draft-day trade, but the 49ers have repeatedly insisted they intend tokeep him.;  SMERLAS A RAIDER? The Los Angeles Raiders are apparentlyinterested in yet another discarded 49er -- nose tackle Fred Smerlas, who wasone of seven 49ers released Monday.;    Smerlas, 34, said Thursday that heexpects to visit the Raiders next week for a workout. Smerlas made $750,000with the 49ers last season despite playing in only six games (and contributingjust one assisted tackle) because of a knee injury and an unspecified backproblem.;    The Indianapolis Colts are also interested, Smerlas' agent, JackMula, said.;    The Raiders already have signed former 49ers Ronnie Lott andRoger Craig as Plan B free agents.;    None of the seven released 49ers --including cornerback Eric Wright, linebackers Keena Turner and Jim Fahnhorst,nose tackle Pete Kugler, offensive lineman Dave Cullity and wide receiver MikeWilson -- will be asked back, a team source said. Turner is expected to takeformer wide receiver Dwight Clark's spot as an executive administrativeassistant working primarily in marketing and public and media relations. Clarkwill move into a position dealing more with scouting and coaching next season,a team source said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RIC BUCHER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910419  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  319  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday April 19, 199100110022,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
