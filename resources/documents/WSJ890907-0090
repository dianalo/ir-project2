The greedy Eighties are supposed to be an era of free-spending hedonism. The current prosperity, the liturgy goes, is based on a consumption binge slighting investment for the future. Soon the party will be over and the piper will have to be paid. There will be much gnashing of teeth, rending of garments and hocking of BMWs.    This jeremiad has been in fashion for several years now despite the inconvenience of sustained prosperity in general and the current investment boom in particular. The standard Commerce Department Survey finds that businesses plan to increase capital investment this year by 9.9%, after a 10.3% boost in 1988. And of course, we still have no signs of capacity bottlenecks while well into the sixth year of a business expansion. Somehow investment has been enough to keep output growing for a record number of years.    So it might be a good idea to take another look at the statistic behind the notion of an investment dearth. In the National Income Accounts, net private domestic investment as a percent of GNP comes out lower in the 1980s than in the 1970s. Therefore, the argument goes, we must cut consumption and leave more savings to flow into investment. And we must increase taxes to close the deficit so money borrowed by the government can flow into investment. And particularly, we must stop borrowing from abroad to pay for imports, leaving foreign debts for future generations.    Now of course, productive investment is essential to future growth and prosperity. But the National Income Accounts were established in a Keynesian era to answer Keynesian questions; &quot;investment&quot; is not what produces in the future, but what uses up savings to prevent a shortage in total demand. Keynes, remember, said digging holes and filling them would be fine with him.    Predictably, then, the classification of investment is somewhat slapdash. Octopus Industry's fifty-first Lear Jet is investment, but your son's engineering education is consumption. A personal auto is consumption, even if it lasts five years, indeed even if it's used in business. The same auto purchased by Hertz is investment. The same with personal computers.    Then there is the problem of depreciation. Net investment is gross investment less depreciation, someone's guess about how fast the existing capital stock is wearing out. Gross investment actually has been quite strong for the past five years, but bigger depreciation allowances keep net investment relatively low.    Indeed, economist Alan Reynolds points out that while depreciation is deducted to get net investment, it's not deducted from gross national product; this leaves the percent of GNP comparison suspect. And of course, if policies succeed and GNP grows, the same investment will be a lower percentage. Also, in the 1980s there has been almost no inflation in the cost of capital goods; in the case of computers, prices have declined. But consumer goods have inflated each year, so nominal comparisons create a phony appearance of a capital slump and consumption binge.    With all of these problems measuring the quantity of investment, it might be worth thinking a bit about the quality of investment, which in fact is more important to the future. Economists John Rutledge and Deborah Allen point out that in the 1970s inflation and high tax rates distorted investment, inducing people not to replace aging factories but to hedge against inflation and take advantage of tax shelters by building hotels, condominiums and shopping centers. That spending was measured as investment, as of course were all wells drilled in search of $50-a-barrel oil. The 1970s investments turned out not to be today's seed corn, but today's problem loans.    A factory allowed to decay into obsolescence, Mr. Rutledge and Ms. Allen point out, is the rough equivalent of a factory bombed out of existence. So the United States at the end of the 1970s resembled Japan and Germany at the end of World War II. In the early Eighties inflation was quashed and taxes were recast to encourage productive investment. The result resembled a reverse Marshall Plan, with spending to replace depleted capital, a rebounding manufacturing center and high foreign investment.    When it comes to imports, indeed, Americans were not blowing their money on CD doodads and big-screen TVs, but spending on the sorts of things John Calvin would approve of. A third of the worsening trade balance in the 1980s was due to American purchases of foreign capital equipment. Another quarter of the deficit was due to purchases of industrial supplies and materials. If Americans went on a global buying binge in the Eighties, more than half the money was spent enlarging U.S. productive capacity.    What this means is that human nature did not change during the 1980s. As usual, people took advantage of good times to buy things they wanted or needed. As usual, people planned for the future by investing as best they could. And as usual, doom and gloom oracles got the whole situation fummoxed up. </TEXT></DOC>
