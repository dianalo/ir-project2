In a letter presented Tuesday to a judicial inquiry commission inPretoria, hotel and casino magnate Sol Kerzner acknowledged the 1986payment to George Matanzima, who at the time was leader of Transkei.The homeland's army overthrew Matanzima in December 1987, accusinghim of corruption.   Kerzner is deputy chairman of Sun International, which has builtluxury hotels and casinos throughout the region, including theinternationally known Sun City resort in Bophuthatswana.   Kerzner said the payment was made to preserve Sun International'smonopoly on gambling licenses in Transkei. He accused Matanzima ofplacing ``undue pressure'' on Sun International by threatening togrant another company the right to open a casino in the impoverishedhomeland.   Kerzner said he acted jointly with David Bloomberg, a businessassociate who was once the mayor of Cape Town. The men issued ajoint statement to the inquiry commission acknowledging the bribe.   Attorney Fanie Cilliers, who is representing Kerzner andBloomberg, said there is no law in South Africa against bribing anofficial from a foreign government. Transkei and Bophuthatswana aredesignated independent by South Africa, although they are notrecognized abroad.   Prosecutors and investigative commissions have uncovered severalother scandals in recent weeks.   Among them:   _An investigative committee this week asked the state toprosecute Parliament member Peet de Pontes for alleged fraud andperjury in connection with smuggling an Italian drug financier intothe country.   Vito Palazzolo, the bankroller for the $1.6 billion ``PizzaConnection'' international drug network, arrived in South Africa inDecember 1986 on a false passport after fleeing Switzerland while ona prison furlough.   De Pontes, who was a rising star in President P.W. Botha'sNational Party, claims he had no knowledge of Palazzolo's criminalrecord when he offered him assistance to settle in South Africa. Hehas refused to quit Parliament.   Botha has sued an Afrikaans-language newspaper, Free Weekly, forlibel over a story that said he and Foreign Minister Pik Botha haddinner with Palazzolo. The newspaper said its story was based on asworn statement given to police.   _Businessman Albert Vermaas, a friend of Pik Botha and othersenior government officials, is under investigation for possibleirregularities involving multimillion-dollar foreign exchange deals.   There are strict limits on the amount of money that can be takenout of South Africa, and Vermaas allegedly was allowed to make hugetransactions without having to receive approval from the ReserveBank.   _Leon de Beer, elected to Parliament in 1987 in a closelycontested race, was convicted last year of vote fraud. De Beer hasresigned from the National Party but has maintained his seat inParliament while he appeals.   _P.W. Botha in December fired Amichand Rajbansi, the only Cabinetmember of Indian descent, following investigations by twoparliamentary committees and an inquiry commission. Rajbansi wasaccused of abusing his post in granting various contracts andlicenses.   Business Day, the country's leading financial daily, said in aneditorial today that Botha ``has presided over the sleaziestadministration South Africa has known'' this century.</TEXT></DOC>
