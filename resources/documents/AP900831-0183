In the forefront is retired Gen. Joseph Lagu, a southerner whofought the government for 17 years and now is its chief U.N.delegate. Many southerners hold Lagu largely responsible for theprocess that led to the current war.   ``We have to appeal to both the government and those in the bushfor a cease-fire,'' he told a rally of southerners held toinaugurate the peace effort. ``We must talk both to our people ingovernment and the rebel areas.''   Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killedor died of famine, and most experts feel neither side can win.   Several national and international mediation efforts havefailed. The latest was a short-lived U.S. attempt declared dead inAugust by Col. Mohammed al-Amin al-Khalifa, the governmentrepresentative in negotiations with the rebels.   This is the first attempt at a solution by southerners, whoselives have been scarred by intermittent war and famine since Sudanbecame independent of Britain and Egypt in 1956.   At the heart of the current and past wars are the religious andracial conflicts between the Moslem Arabs of the north, who controlthe government, and the black Christians and aminists of the south.   More than 100 politicians from the south, an area the size ofTexas, are involved in the current search for peace. Many werepolitical prisoners until their release this summer.   Brig. Pio Yukuwan Deng, the chief organizer, is one of threesoutherners in the 15-member military junta that has ruled Sudansince June 30, 1989.   Deng, a Christian who served with Lagu's rebels in the 1960s,told the rally: ``We must have our say in the peacemaking in thiscountry. Without southerners coming together, peace cannot berealized in Sudan.''   Southerners never have united, even in the cause of secession.   For 17 years, Lagu led the Anyanya movement, whose main supportcame from relatively minor tribes in the huge Equatoria region. Theorganization's name denotes the poison of the Gabon viper.   Nearly all the rebels of the current Sudan People's LiberationArmy are Dinka, the south's main tribe, based in the Nile Riverprovinces. Dinka neither trust nor are trusted by the Equatorians.   Lagu came to terms in 1972 with President Gaafar Nimeiri, whowas overthrown in 1985, and joined the army in the name of nationalreconciliation.   Southern Sudanese believe the current war is rooted in thediscovery of oil in the south in the early 1980s.   They say the discovery prompted Nimeiri to renege on commitmentshe made in the 1972 peace agreement and divide the autonomous southinto three weak regions.   That was accomplished by having Lagu instigate the small tribesagainst the Dinka. In the turmoil that resulted, Nimeiri decreedthe partition.   Col. John Garang, a U.S.-trained southerner, mutinied in thegarrison town of Bor, 650 miles south of Khartoum, the capital,formed a rebel army and went into the bush.   Garang demands more say in government for the south and a largershare of the nation's resources for the region.   At the rally, Lagu asked forgiveness. He told the crowd he hadhelped destroy southern influence and spawned Garang's rebellionbecause ``I wanted to reduce the domination of small tribes by thebig tribes.''   Sira Nay, a southern political activist at the rally, said theproblem was as much politics as tribalism.   ``Only the military can bring peace to this country,'' he said.``They don't have the constraints of the political parties, whohave their own axes to grind.''   Nay pointed out that the military ended Lagu's rebellion in1972, three years after Nimeiri seized power in a coup, and hedeclared: ``Now we will wait and see if this government can repeathistory.''   The junta, led by Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, has saidending the war is a prime objective but has done little to achieveit.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tuesday Sept 11</NOTE></DOC>
