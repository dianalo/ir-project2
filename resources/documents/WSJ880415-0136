The employees, including a grocery store clerk from Philadelphia and a doctors' office receptionist from Denver, said they have had to cope with inadequate medical care, unaffordable bills or both.    Annette Lopez, the receptionist, said the federal Medicaid program paid for her daughter Colleen's two-month stay in the hospital after she was born prematurely. But she said five subsequent hospital stays have cost $22,000 -- and there's no one to pay it but herself and her husband on their wages of $6 an hour each.    Daniel Casey, the clerk, said his parents were uninsured, had diabetes and died in their 30s for lack of proper medical care. He said he has diabetes and no insurance, and must depend on clinics with spotty care and no evening hours.    The testimony came at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing yesterday. There are an estimated 37.2 million Americans without health insurance. About two-thirds of them are workers or dependents who would be covered by the plan under consideration by Congress.    The bill, introduced by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), would require employers to provide a minimum package of health insurance to people working 17.5 hours a week or more. Benefits would have to include hospital and doctor care, prenatal and well-baby care, diagnostic testing and catastrophic protection.    Employers would pay at least 80% of the premium. Pool arrangements and a phase-in period would make plans more affordable to small or new firms. The Senate version of the bill, already approved by Sen. Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee, also says very small or new employers would only have to provide catastrophic protection.    The business community is divided on the plan. Many firms say they are philosophically opposed to mandated benefits, but corporations with health plans complain they are indirectly footing the bill for firms without them.    The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a prime opponent of the Kennedy-Waxman bill, said the measure would cause many workers to lose other benefits and maybe even their jobs. </TEXT></DOC>
