The debate centered on concern about West German sovereigntyfollowing a series of NATO warplane crashes earlier this year andthe Aug. 28 accident at the U.S. Ramstein air base that left 69people dead. Hundreds of people were injured in the Ramsteintragedy that occurred when three planes in an Italian stunt-flyingteam collided and one smashed into the crowd and exploded in flames.   Many West Germans have complained about property damage causedby frequent ground maneuvers by U.S. military forces and low-levelflights of NATO planes.   Media commentators, opposition politicians and others havecalled on the federal government to control what the U.S. militaryand other North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations are allowed todo on West German soil and in the country's skies.   Kolbow said the Ramstein disaster and deafening low-level NATOtraining flights have infuriated the West German population.   ``In peacetime, that which is meant to be defended and protectedshould certainly not be damaged or destroyed,'' he said. ``Concern_ indeed anger _ is increasing among those affected.''   NATO military jets flying at treetop levels are a common sightin West Germany.   The Social Democrats are demanding the government tell theUnited States and other NATO members with warplanes in West Germanyto halt the low-level flights.   Florian Gerster, another Social Democrat, also spoke of WestGerman sovereignty.   ``Americans, Britons and French would not themselves accept sucha burden for very long. The Allies should respect the politicalwishes of the German federal lawmakers,'' said Gerster.   Kolbow demanded ``the federal government and NATO immediatelydevelop a defense concept that finally makes possible a ban onmilitary low-level training flights.''   ``Our view is that an immediate halt to low-level flights ispossible because of the development of modern military technologyand because of the relaxed situation between East and West,'' hesaid.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has said low-level flightsare necessary to train pilots, but it is pressing for a reductionin those flights.   West Germany is considered one of the most militarized regionsin the world. Almost 250,000 U.S. forces are stationed in thecountry.</TEXT></DOC>
