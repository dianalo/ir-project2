A knowledge of the fundamental chemistryof the reactions of sulfur-bearing gases, such as hydrogen sulfide andsulfur dioxide, with calcium-based sorbents is the main goal of thisproject. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques are beingused as the main avenue of approach to determining the experimental datathat will be used as the means of obtaining a basic chemical understanding.The experiments are conducted over a temperature range of 25{sup 0} to1000{sup 0}C and are being performed on high purity, single crystal surfaces.Theoretical models which simulate the reactions of sulfur-bearing gaseswith porous sorbent particles are being used to extrapolate reactioninformation obtained under high vacuum conditions for comparison withsorbent performance under process conditions. Depth profile studies inconjunction with the XPS experiments on the reacted surfaces will beutilized as the means of determining the depth of penetration of sulfurinto the sorbent particle, as well as the penetration depth of the oxygen.The oxidation of the sulfide to the more stable sulfate is importantfrom an environmental viewpoint since the sulfur that remains in theash that is removed from the bed must be in a stable form for disposal.One project goal is to determine what, if any, environmental problemsmight result in the disposal of this ash and to determine methods ofdealing with them. 18 references.</TEXT></DOC>
