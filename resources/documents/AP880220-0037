Relishing the limelight relinquished by Sen. Bob Dole and PatRobertson, who boycotted the GOP debate Friday night in Dallas,Kemp assailed Bush's stance on a nuclear missile defense and calledthe vice president's budget-balancing plan unworkable.   The candidates in both parties kept up heavy-duty rhetoricalfire as they sought to gain momentum going into upcoming primariesand caucuses, especially the Super Tuesday contests in 20 states onMarch 8.   While Bush suggested that Dole was ``angry and bitter'' over hissecond-place finish in New Hampshire, the vice president's aidesacknowledged that he was withdrawing from competition in Tuesday'sSouth Dakota primary. Bush wants to devote more attention to thesouthern and border states holding contests on Super Tuesday, theysaid.   Dole, meanwhile, appearing in Lexington, Ky., said he was notshaken by his runner-up showing in New Hampshire and that he willdo well in South Dakota and Minnesota.   ``We're ready for the next round in South Dakota and Minnesotaand we'll see who wins those two. We'll see who's dispiritedWednesday morning next week,'' the Kansas senator said.   In their second caustic debate in as many days, three Democraticcandidates played catch-the-leader in turning their criticismtoward front-runners Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt.   Jesse Jackson drew hoots from the crowd in St. Paul, Minn., whenhe asked Gephardt if he was ``proud of your vote for the Reagan taxcut in 1981.'' The Missouri congressman defended his overall taxvoting record. Most of that tax cut ``went to ordinary people,'' hesaid. Jackson retorted: ``That was the trigger of this wholedeficit crisis.''   Dukakis, the winner of the New Hampshire primary this week, tooka direct shot at Gephardt's trade policies, warning during theFriday debate that ``we've got to do more than wave a fist at ourforeign competitors.''   ``Why is everyone defending unfair trade practices?'' Gephardtsaid.   Toward the end of a turbulent campaign week that saw thewithdrawals of Republicans Alexander M. Haig Jr. and Pete du Pontand Democrat Bruce Babbitt, there were these other developments:   _Democrat Paul Simon said in South Dakota that he would remainin the presidential race, despite saying just days earlier he woulddrop out if he didn't win in South Dakota or Minnesota's contestsnext Tuesday.   ``I'm in it until the finish line in Atlanta,'' he said,contending he had received an ``outpouring of encouragement'' andmoney since his disappointing third-place finish in New Hampshire.   _Robertson, holding a rally with supporters at the same poshDallas hotel where Bush and his entourage had stayed, said hebacked out of the debate because he didn't get enough tickets forhis supporters, ``and I'd rather be with you here.''   Because of the no-shows by Dole and Robertson, Kemp got a rareopportunity to confront Bush, with wide television exposure andwithout interference from others. He didn't flinch.   ``I believe in the Reagan revolution and I want to carry it intothe 1990s,'' the New York congressman said in a point-blankchallenge to Bush's oft-stated campaign pitch that he is therightful heir to the Reagan legacy.   In an exchange that provoked laughter, debate moderator RogerMudd asked if the Kemp and Bush appearance might suggest a GOPticket for 1988. Kemp responded, ``I don't think George Bush wantsto serve another eight years as vice president.''   In the night's sharpest exchange, Kemp attacked Bush on nuclearweapons, saying he would more quickly research, test and develop amissile defense shield.   Bush said it would be wrong to support ``prematuredevelopment,'' and Kemp asserted that they must ``stand up forsomething'' beyond peace alone.   ``I was in combat,'' Bush replied, referring to his record inWorld War II experience. ``I don't think you know what it is untilyou've seen your fellow men drop dead.''   Kemp snapped back: ``I don't need a lecture.''   The Democrats, during their St. Paul run-in, seemed oblivious toparty chairman Paul Kirk's exhortation that they cut down some ofthe internecine warfare.   In a ``Dear Candidate'' letter, Kirk said personal attacks amongthe contenders ``do nothing to enhance the opportunity for aDemocratic victory in November.''   But the candidates seemed unfazed by this.   Dukakis complained that ``my name was taken in vain'' by GaryHart, who demanded to know why the Massachusetts governor had notfollowed his example and released a budget proposal.   ``The reason my colleagues have not put out budgets is becausethey don't want to tell the American people the facts,'' Hart said.   ``I'm the only person on this platform who has balanced abudget,'' retorted Dukakis.</TEXT></DOC>
