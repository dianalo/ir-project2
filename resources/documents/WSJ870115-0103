Rohatyn and Roger C. Altman contained in &quot;Confront the Mexican Problem&quot; (editorial page, Nov. 26).    They correctly state that Mexico's future is of vital concern to the U.S. and that Mexico's economy is in serious trouble. Yet their solution to this situation rests on a shift of investment by U.S. manufacturers from U.S. operations to Mexican plants. They specifically mention autos and steel as basic industries for which the U.S. needs &quot;lower-cost manufacturing&quot; that can be supplied from south of the border because &quot;Mexico has abundant land and labor.&quot; Following this logic, what would be produced in the U.S.? Without additional investment in this country, cheaper sources of just about any manufactured good can be found. But that approach would cost us dearly in terms of lost jobs, lower living standards and continued erosion of our industrial base.    The recent efforts of the Commerce Department to promote relocation of U.S. jobs to Mexico along the lines of the Rohatyn-Altman proposal have been roundly criticized by Congress. Commerce Department funding for a conference promoting Maquiladora (assembly plant) investment in Mexico was cut off for this fiscal year and a full accounting of government funds spent on activities encouraging foreign investment by U.S. firms was required. Even so, the Maquiladora conference went forward as scheduled, under &quot;private&quot; auspices.    We do not believe the tragedy of plummeting real wages and economic stagnation in Mexico will be resolved by further weakening the goods-producing segment of the U.S. economy. Nor do we believe that the U.S. banks that made billions of dollars in loans to Mexico should be sheltered from the need to write down the value of the loans at the expense of American workers in manufacturing industries.    The situation in Mexico demands serious attention from the U.S. Developing lasting solutions requires the cooperation of many groups with diverse interests. The Rohatyn-Altman plan fails to address the need of Mexican workers for more production for the Mexican market and the American economy's need for a stronger industrial base to sustain improvements in living standards. The UAW is eager to contribute to constructive discussions; we are equally anxious to prevent multinational companies and banks from using this crisis to further weaken the U.S. economy.
