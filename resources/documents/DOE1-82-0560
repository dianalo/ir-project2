<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-0560 </DOCNO><TEXT>Although IMP scans fail to show fine anatomical details of the brain,because of poor resolution of a single head rotational system, adequateinformation is offered by the scans to localize most perfusion defectscaused by stroke. The following conclusions can be drawn from our study:1. The planar IMP brain scans processed through the computer are sensitivein the early diagnosis of acute stroke except for small and deeply localizedlesions. 2. The SPECT IMP imaging is more sensitive than the planar ortransmission CT scans in the early diagnosis of stroke. Semiquantitativeevaluations are feasible with IMP SPECT. 3. Neither transmission CT norIMP SPECT are sensitive in the detection of acute lacunar infarcts. 4.In acute infarction, the transmission CT is usually negative or minimallypositive in the early stages, while impaired uptake of IMP occurs immediatelyafter the onset of the stroke. In acute stroke, the extent of the perfusiondefect on IMP is usually greater than the abnormality seen on the transmissionCT. 5. On followup studies, IMP scans show improved perfusion reflectingphysiologic changes, while transmission CT scans show further dense anatomicalchanges when compared to the initial studies. 6. Hyperemic changes arelikely due to collateral circulation or luxury perfusion. This findingsuggests that the IMP reflects local cerebral blood flow in strokes.</TEXT></DOC>
