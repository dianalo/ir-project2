ClaibornePell, D-R.I., said Friday just before the Senate passed the measurejust 18 hours after it was drafted.   ``This is truly a crime against humanity. It is genocide, infact,'' said Pell, deploring the use of poison gas against Kurdishcivilians and the dynamiting of Kurdish villages.   Reps. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., and John Porter, R-Ill., introducedan identical measure in the House. The lawmakers, co-chairmen ofthe Congressional Human Rights Caucus, also sent a letter to IraqiPresident Saddam Hussein calling for an end to ``warfare againstthe Kurdish population.''   Sadoon Hamadi, minister of state for foreign affairs, repeateddenials Friday that any poison-gas attack had taken place. He saidindependent observers might be permitted in the northern borderarea of Iraq, where many of the Kurds live, if hostilities in theregion end.   The bill, which was sent to the House, would require the U.S.representative to international financial institutions such as theWorld Bank to vote against all loans to Iraq.   It would also bar all U.S. financial credits or creditguarantees.   Aides to Pell said this would immediately halt at least $800million in credit or credit guarantees, a step they said would makeit even more difficult for Iraq to service its huge $60 billiondebt incurred during its eight-year war with neighboring Iran.   The measure also would end the import of Iraqi oil into theUnited States, end any U.S. economic or military aid and bar thetransfer to Iraq of sensitive high technology items subject to U.S.export controls.   The Pell aides, who declined to be identified, said the latterstep would prevent Iraq from importing vital spare parts forequipment and technology already in the country, prevent it fromcompleting certain projects and bar the export to Iraq of suchitems as computers, petroleum drilling equipment and air trafficcontrol equipment.   Pell, stressing the bipartisan support on the foreign policyissue, said he hoped the Reagan administration will quickly endorsethe bill.</TEXT></DOC>
