Modification in the oxidation behaviourof Al-implanted 304 SS was determined by oxidation kinetics and spectrophotometry.The difference between the reflectivities before and after oxidationof Al-implanted 304 SS, correlates well with weight gain measurements.Qualitative explanations are offered in terms of radiation damage andlight absorption in the oxide layer.</TEXT></DOC>
