It was Grammy night 1989, and the group's &quot;Brasil&quot; album had just wonthe award for best pop performance by a duo or group with vocal, beating outthe likes of Gloria Estefan's Miami Sound Machine and the Beach Boys.Suddenly, it looked as if this vocal quartet was poised for big-time popsuccess.;   And then . . . nothing.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MANHATTAN TRANSFER ON TRACK AGAIN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Music  </MEMO><TEXT>     Now, the Manhattan Transfer is back, with a new album, a new tour, a newlabel and a new sense of direction. Sit down with &quot;The Offbeat of Avenues&quot; --the group's first recording since &quot;Brasil&quot; -- and you will be astonished atthe vitality of its sound, from the hip-hop-be-bop fusion of &quot;What Goes AroundComes Around&quot; to the stunning virtuosity of &quot;Blues for Pablo.&quot; Hearing it, youwould swear the group had almost been reborn in making the album.;   In asense, says Tim Hauser, they had. &quot;When we did our 'Brasil' album and went outand toured, we did it quite extensively,&quot; he says over the phone from his homein Los Angeles. &quot;When that was over, we all had a lot of different reasons tonot want to go out and tour for a while.&quot;;   One of the reasons had to do withthe group's relationship with its label at the time, Atlantic Records. &quot;We hadbeen with Atlantic for 14, 15 years, and you start to feel like old furnitureafter a while, because people are always excited about the new act. And eventhough we would try to make changes from album to album, after a while, thechanges weren't greeted with the kind of attitude that we felt theydeserved.&quot;;   That was particularly true with &quot;Brasil,&quot; says Hauser. &quot;Itdidn't get an awful lot of airplay,&quot; he says. &quot;We thought it was a really goodalbum. We felt 'Soul Food to Go' should have been a hit. It sounded like a hitwhen we heard it the first time; we thought, 'What a great groove. What agreat song. With English lyrics, that could be a hit.' &quot;;   &quot;Hold on,&quot; hesays, interrupting himself. &quot;My son is screaming.&quot; Which introduces anotherreason the Transfer went on hiatus: Hauser's 2 1/2-year-old son, Basie.;   &quot;Mywife was pregnant with her second child -- my first -- and I didn't have anygreat reason for wanting to go out and tour after the birth of my son,&quot; hesays after calm is restored. &quot;Plus we were just tired from traveling so muchand working as much as we were. So we decided we'd take a while off, and seeif we could just develop new ideas.&quot;;   One year stretched into two, thenthree, as the group negotiated its exit from Atlantic and a new deal withColumbia. Finally, last September, the Manhattan Transfer got back to work.&quot;It was real hard getting started again,&quot; says Hauser, laughing. &quot;When you'reaway for a while, you really lose your work groove.&quot; Further complicatingthings was the group's indecision over what kind of album to make.;   &quot;Butafter battling back and forth . . . we wound up writing almost all the songs,which we've never done before. That was a real adventure.&quot;;   It was also areal breakthrough for the four. &quot;For us, that's like kind of going throughanother door in our career,&quot; he says.;   &quot;Some people are singers, and that'sit,&quot; he adds. &quot;They don't write. There are a few writers who really sing greattoo. But that was never our thing. I never really thought of myself as awriter. But all of a sudden, this thing started, and it worked. So it's realexciting to know that there's this whole other thing that's there for us.&quot;;  Although the songs on &quot;The Offbeat of Avenues&quot; touch on a variety of styles,the album's real constant is jazz. Some of the musical references are obvious,like Hauser's New Orleans-style &quot;Blue Serenade,&quot; or &quot;Blues for Pablo,&quot; a vocalsetting of the famous Miles Davis-Gil Evans piece from &quot;Sketches of Spain.&quot;Others, though, are more subtle. &quot;Sassy,&quot; for instance, is partly a tribute tothe great jazz singer Sarah Vaughan.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Baltimore Sun  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910903  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  745  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, September 3, 199100247050,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
