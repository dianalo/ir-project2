Energy Secretary James D. Watkins says oil inevitably will bethe dominant fuel well into the 21st century. He has becomeconvinced, though, that the federal government must do more now tobegin curing the nation of its costly oil addiction.   It's not yet clear how the new federal role will be written, butalmost certainly it will emphasize the virtues of conservation andrenewable energy resources.   That alone would be a major change from the eight years of theReagan administration, which tried to abolish the Energy Departmentand, failing that, consistently cut its budget for energyconservation. The department's 1989 conservation budget was lessthan one-third its 1980 level, adjusted for inflation.   There are at least three main reasons for the turnabout underWatkins: the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which turned much of publicopinion against the oil industry, longer-range concerns aboutenvironmental damage from burning fossil fuels, and fear that theUnited States is becoming overly reliant on Middle Eastern oil.   The Reagan administration ``went too far ... in getting rid ofmany good programs'' in energy conservation and renewable energyresearch, Watkins told a hearing Wednesday in Washington on thelink between energy and national security.   The hearing was one in a series that Watkins and his chiefdeputies have held in cities across the nation this fall. Watkinssays he is looking for ideas on how to devise a ``national energystrategy'' to last for the next four decades.   Shortly after he took office last March, Watkins said he foundthe department's bookshelves contained plenty of good descriptionsof the nation's energy goals but no policy document that spelledout how it could reach those goals.   Watkins also discovered that the department's credibility waslow and still slipping. So rather than piece together an energyplan on his own, Watkins decided take his policy-writing show onthe road to solicit advice from the public.   What he has heard so far, after public sessions in 11 citiesfrom coast to coast, is that conservation, with a bigger push fromthe federal government, can help achieve many key energy goals:holding down oil imports, keeping prices steady, limiting the needfor new power plants and curbing air pollution.   At the Washington hearing Watkins made it clear he has gottenthe message.   If the final energy plan that the administration submits to theCongress a year from now does not put a major emphasis onconservation and renewable energy resources such as solar power,``then this thing is dead on arrival,'' he said.   Even some supporters of Reagan's conservation-cutting moves arenow singing a different tune.   ``I have been converted to a greater appreciation ofconservation and renewable energy,'' Henson Moore, the deputyenergy secretary, said recently. As a Louisiana congressman duringmost of the Reagan administration, Moore voted for repeated cuts inconservation funds and research on energy efficiency.   ``I know more about it now,'' said Moore, who is fond of sayinghis roots are in the oil patch.   The big oil companies know a lot about conservation, and theythink it's overrated. The American Petroleum Institute, the mainoil trade association, recently published a leaflet that said agreater federal role in promoting conservation would only give thepublic ``false hopes'' and sharply higher energy prices.   Public opinion polls, however, indicate that Americans want moreemphasis on conservation and development of renewable energysources, and less on oil production.   A poll conducted in November for the Union of ConcernedScientists asked people across the nation how best to meet futureenergy needs and reduce air pollution. Eight out of 10 said usemore renewable sources and increase energy efficiency. About one in10 said produce more oil, natural gas and coal. The rest didn'tanswer.</TEXT></DOC>
