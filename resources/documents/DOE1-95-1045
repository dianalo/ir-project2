The induction of vitellogenin mRNA is achieved by three basicmechanisms: (a) an increase of at least several thousand fold in theabsolute rate of vitellogenin gene transcription, which rises from undetectablelevels to approximately 5 transcripts per gene per min., (b) an increaseof approximately 20 fold in the absolute rate of total nuclear RNA synthesis,and (c) a selective stabilization of vitellogenin mRNA against cytoplasmicdegradation. Vitellogenin mRNA is degraded with a half life of approximately3 weeks in the presence of estrogen and exhibits a half life of 16 hoursafter estrogen is removed from the culture medium. The 30 fold increasein the stability of vitellogenin mRNA in the presence of estrogen isa specific, reversible cytoplasmic effect of the steroid hormone. Theauthors' measurements of the absolute rate of nuclear vitellogenin genetranscription and of the rate of appearance of the mRNA in the cytoplasmdemonstrate that the average efficiency with which individual interveningsequences are excised from vitellogenin transcripts in vivo is at least99%. A coordinated series of nuclear and cytoplasmic events are requiredto achieve the massive estrogen-mediated induction of vitellogenin synthesisand secretion. More detailed mechanistic studies of these regulatoryprocesses are under way.</TEXT></DOC>
