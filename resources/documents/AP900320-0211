John Soorholtz.   Dorrian half-heartedly defended his decision to support aone-day meat boycott in the nation's top pork-producing state, buteven he conceded, ``It's probably something that should never havebeen signed.''   The Meatout was the idea of the Farm Animal Reform Movement, anational advocacy group opposed to ``factory farming'' and in favorof vegeterian diets. It was intended as a response to National MeatWeek _ another of the nation's lesser-known commemorations.   The Meatout was supported by such entertainment figures as DorisDay, Ally Sheedy and River Phoenix, and ``American Top 40'' radioannouncer Casey Kasem.   It also was observed, perhaps inadvertently, by about 500 peoplewho ate vegetarian meals at three soup kitchens in the Pittsburgharea. The food was donated and served by volunteers from AnimalAdvocates and the Pittsburgh Vegetarian Society.   About 165 people ate vegetarian chili, corn, fruit cocktail andbread at the Rainbow Kitchen in Homestead, a depressed former steeltown just outside of Pittsburgh.   ``They liked it. We do serve vegetarian meals from time totime,'' said Kevin Amos, the kitchen's food program manager.   It was somewhat less of a success in Philadelphia _ birthplaceof freedom and the cheesesteak _ where Meatout supporters targetedJim's Steaks on South Street as their staging ground.   A group of high school vegetarians stood outside the art decolandmark passing out anti-meat fliers, carrots and orange slices asthe aroma of seared beef and fried onions wafted overhead.   But they were evidently unable to cow any of the early lunchcrowd into avoiding meat for a day. The usual stampede beganshortly after 11 a.m.   ``If they don't want to eat it, they don't have to,'' said LeonSchwartz, a 30-year-old Philadelphian ``weaned'' on the famedcheesesteak, a mound of sliced beef slathered with melted cheeseserved on a roll. ``I want to, and I eat it. That's what America isall about.''   ``What is this, save a cow?'' said Bernie Bartholome, a New Yorkbusinessman as he chewed on a cheesesteak laden with peppers,onions and tomatoes. ``See _ I eat vegetables, too.''   Many passersby accepted the handout from the students andchomped on the carrots.   ``As long as they read it and understand, that's a start,'' saidRachel Randolph, 15. ``People are being real receptive.''   ``This is a Philadelphia institution, so we decided to standhere,'' said Laura Kuperman, 16. ``We're trying to be friendly, notconfrontational.''   What's their beef?   The demonstrators said raising livestock is environmentallydangerous, wastes vital farmland and is cruel to animals.   It's also bad for you, they said, reciting statistics aboutheart disease, saturated fat, cancer, hormones and otheruncomfortable topics.   ``Even if they don't convert, their eyes will be open,'' saidJane Edelstein, 15.   ``We're trying to make people more aware,'' added AlixHetherington, 16.   Anything more, presumably, would be gravy.</TEXT></DOC>
