Crystalof tin or indium without the addition of such impurities as F, Cl, andSb (for giving electro-conductivity) tends to grow in the vertical directionagainst the substrate. Therefore, by changing the thickness of the undopedlayer, the surface uneveness can be well controlled. The result is thatthe light dispersion could be made larger, improving the performanceof the solar cell. (3 figs, 2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
