(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Commodore C386SX-LT If the Commodore C386SX-LT looks curiously familiar, it'sbecause it's essentially the same machine as the Sanyo 18NB (see previousreview).andP;  True, it's coated in that odd felt-like stuff favoured by Toshibafor its high-end luggable machines, and true, it has the distinctiveCommodore logo emblazoned on the top; but for all that, its externalaccoutrements and internal electronics make it a dead ringer for Sanyo's18NB.andM;Badging of laptops is an increasingly common occurrence because much of thetechnology involved is so readily available.andP;  Texas Instruments and Sharp,for example, sell laptops manufactured in the same place, by the same company-- all they do is put their own names on the hardware and adjust the priceaccordingly.andM;So, if you put aside that distinctive Commodore casing, the two machines areidentical.andP;  They both have one parallel, one serial and one VGA port(underneath an identical flap); the reset, brightness and contrast controlsare in the same place, as is the unusual pinsized hole on the left-hand sideof the machine.andP;  This is a clever safety feature which allows you to resetthe power supply -- which kicks off if you try and put more than a 16 voltcharge into it.andM;To add memory or a 387 co-processor, you can easily get inside by removingthree screws, and memory is added in the same increments in exactly the samefashion as the Sanyo.andP;  Commodore's pricing, however, is slightly underSanyo's and a 2Mb upgrade will cost you 399 pounds.andM;The C386SX-LT which was reviewed had 640Kb memory with an additional 2048Kbconfigured as extended memory, a 20Mb hard disk, keyboard template and anexternal AC adaptor/battery charger.andP;  Commodore reckons that a fully chargedbattery will give you around three hours of use.andP;  In practice, I found itcame in at a very reasonable two and a bit hours.andP;  The C386SX-LT can be fastcharged in around one hour with the machine turned off, or trickle charged inaround 12 hours.andP;  Spare batteries cost 90 pounds and an extra charger comesin at 59 pounds.andP;  Commodore claims that when the low battery light starts toflash you've got 15 minutes of time left (in my experience it's considerablyless) and when the screen starts to flash you should save and switch offimmediately.andM;In use, the keyboard is more or less fine; it's almost identical to theSanyo, although for some reason Commodore has elected to place the '\' keyunderneath the right backspace where you're least likely to find it, whileSanyo has put it in its rightful position next to Left Shift.andM;Obviously, this was an early model -- which presumably accounts for the waythe VGA screen shows through the grille on the right-hand side of the frameand why there were two tiny gaps top and bottom.andP;  In use, however, it wasexcellent and is certainly good enough to run graphics programs as well asthe more commonplace text-based ones.andM;Of the two, Sanyo's is due to make its appearance the soonest while Commodoreconfirms its machine won't be ready to ship for about six weeks.andP;  The machineI looked at was the first in the country and clearly labelled 'WorkingSample' on the bottom; that didn't prevent it from running the PC Userbenchmarks, as well as Windows, Harvard Graphics, WordPerfect 5.1, NortonAdvanced Utilities and LapLink 3.andM;To conclude, between this and the Sanyo, it's down to price.andP;  The C386SX-LTis a good performer; the screen is of a high standard and the keyboard issolid and responsive.andP;  But if Commodore is committed to selling at thisprice, then I can see no reason for recommending it over the Sanyo.andM;PC USER VERDICTandM;Products: Commodore X386SX-LT Description: 386SX-based VGA notebook PC.andO;Supplied by: Commodore UK Tel: (0628) 770088 Price: 2,000 pounds to 2,500poundsandM;Poor Moderate Good ExcellentandM;Characteristics Ease of use Documentation Engineering PerformanceandM;* Same as the Sanyo but at least 300 pounds more expensive; the price HAS tocome down.andM;PC USER VERDICTandM;Product: Sanyo 18NB Description: 386SX-based notebook.andP;  Supplied by: SanyoTel:(0923) 246363 Price: 1,795 pounds (1Mb memory; 20Mb hard disk)andM;Poor Moderate Good ExcellentandM;Characteristics East of use Documentation Engineering PerformanceandM;* First-class notebook computer with a good screen and keyboard, and a keenprice.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
