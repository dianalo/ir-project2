Rep. John Dingell, the powerful chairman of the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee, said he would oppose abranching proposal that doesn't also curtail bank entranceinto the securities business. As a result, House and Senateleaders, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Senate BankingCommittee Chairman Donald Riegle and Mr. Dingell workedFriday night in an unsuccessful search for a compromise onthe securities issue.</LP><TEXT>   Both the House and the Senate have passed banking billsthat replenish the shrinking deposit insurance fund andtighten bank regulation to reduce the number and cost offuture bank failures. But the broader Senate bill calls forinterstate branching, new rules limiting bank entrance intothe insurance business, and a cap on credit-card interestrates.   Yesterday, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchellpredicted that when House-Senate conferees meet today, theywill kill the cap on credit-card interest rates.   Earlier this month, Mr. Dingell (D., Mich.) helped defeattwo banking bills that he said didn't adequately protecttaxpayers by keeping banks out of the securities business.Federal banking law basically keeps banks out of thesecurities business, although the Federal Reserve Board hasallowed 35 banks to enter the securities business on alimited basis. On Friday, Mr. Dingell asked either for amoratorium on new Fed actions or a new set of rules designedto prevent banks from setting up nationwide securitiesoperations. But discussions on Friday and Saturday failed toproduce an acceptable compromise.   House Speaker Thomas Foley has concluded that the Housecan't pass a banking bill without the support of Mr. Dingell,who influences a block of votes. If Mr. Dingell won't agreeto interstate branching, Mr. Foley (D., Wash.) has said Houseconferees must insist on a narrower bill than Sen. Riegle(D., Mich.) and the administration want.   The Bush administration contends that branching would be amajor step toward a stronger banking system, and officialshave suggested that President Bush might veto a bill thatdoesn't include branching. But a veto would be difficult now.In an interview Friday, William Taylor, chairman of theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., said that without new moneysoon, the FDIC might have to delay closing some banks.   On the second major difference between the bills, there'slittle appetite for the Senate provision calling for afloating cap on credit-card interest rates that would reducerates to 14% from the current average of 18.9%. The proposalwas cited as one reason for the stock market's 120-pointdecline on Nov. 15.   Yesterday on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Sen. Mitchell (D.,Maine) said, &quot;The banking conference is likely not to agreeto that proposal but, perhaps, to some interim measure,&quot; suchas a study of why rates on credit debt have remained highwhile other interest rates have fallen sharply.   But even if Congress doesn't adopt a cap, Mr. Mitchellsaid that credit-card issuers should interpret the Senatevote as a warning to lower their rates.</TEXT></DOC>
