Col. William Higgins was hanged by hisMiddle Eastern captors, but he cut short a two-day Western trip todeal with a ``matter that has shocked the American people right tothe core.''   Bush said in Chicago that he would first try to learn what hadhappened to Higgins, and then ``figure out what might conceivablybe done'' in response.   He ordered a late-afternoon meeting of his national securityadvisers.   Meanwhile, death threats were made against another Americanhostage and a British hostage.   Arriving at the White House, Bush told reporters, ``I don't havewhat I would call a final confirmation'' that Higgins had beenkilled. He said he had talked to the U.N. secretary general and toHiggins' wife Robin, whom he described as a ``stoic individual whois going through sheer hell.''   ``At this juncture we want to get all the information and besure we're dealing with facts ... but it is a most troubling anddisturbing matter that has shocked the American people right to thecore,'' the president said.   ``There is no way I can properly express the outrage that Ifeel,'' he said. ``And somehow there has got to be a return todecency and honor even in matters of this nature.''   Higgins, 44, was serving as part of an internationalpeacekeeping force in Lebanon when he was taken captive in February1988. Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors said today they hanged himin retaliation for Israel's kidnapping of a Moslem cleric. Thegroup released a videotape purporting to show the execution.   A group called the Revolutionary Justice Organization said in astatement delivered to the independent Beirut newspaper An-Naharthat it would execute another American hostage, Joseph JamesCicippio, unless Israel freed Obeid by 6 p.m. (11 a.m. EDT) Tuesday.   Cicippio, 58, acting comptroller of the American University ofBeirut, was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.   In Nicosia, Cyprus, an anonymous caller claiming to speak forOppressed on Earth said in a phone call to The Associated Pressthat unless Obeid is released, the organization would kill aBritish hostage, Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite. The caller saidWaite would be killed Tuesday at the same hour Higgins was killed.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, returning home from aconference in Paris, called the reported killing ``outrageous anduncivilized behavior,'' but he added: ``I do have to say that thesereports are as yet unconfirmed and I am not in a position toconfirm the accuracy of the report.''   State Department officials, insisting on anonymity, described ascredible news reports that the victim in the videotape was indeedHiggins. They were unable to say, however, whether the taping wasdone this morning or earlier.   A senior administration official, speaking to reporters aboardthe plane carrying Baker back to Washington, said the United Statesis not holding Israel responsible for the reported execution ofHiggins.   The official, who demanded that reporters not identify him,said, ``Violence and kidnaping are not the route to peace'' in theMiddle East.   Asked if the statements Bush and Baker had made deploringkidnaping were intended as criticism of Israel, the official said,``I am not criticizing Israel for what it did. That's not theinterpretation.''   Israel offered earlier in the day to swap the cleric, SheikAbdul Karim Obeid, and that country's Shiite Moslem captives inexchange for all captured Israeli soldiers and foreign hostagesheld by Shiite groups in Lebanon.   Bush had no comment on the Israeli proposal, although he saidlast week, ``I don't think kidnapping and violence helps the causeof peace.''   But Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said in Washington,``Perhaps a little more responsibility on the part of the Israelisone of these days would be refreshing.''   A somber president made his comments in the opening moments of aspeech to the National Governors' Association meeting in Chicago,the first stop of what had been planned as a three-state trip.   ``Whether this report is true or not, I know I speak for allhere when I try to express to the American people the sense ofoutrage that we all feel about this kind of brutality, thisuncalled-for terrorism,'' Bush said.   ``This was a young American colonel serving in internationalforce and it is incumbent upon all of us to try and rectify thissituation if at all possible,'' he said.   Bush offered no details of his plans as he stopped briefly toanswer reporters' questions.   ``This is a matter of grave concern to the American people,'' hesaid. ``Discussing is not the way to conduct the foreign policy ornational security policy of this country. We're not going to handleit that way.''   Bush canceled visits to Las Vegas and Oklahoma City today andTuesday to return to Washington. He said he would ``convene our topnational security people, and confirm to the best of our ability ifthis report is true, and then consider what might be done.''   There are nine Americans in captivity in the Middle East,including Terry Anderson, Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press.   Pete Williams, a spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,said Cheney is ``following the same reports we are all following.''   Cheney met with Higgins' wife, Robin, on Saturday, and bothappeared during the day at the annual convention of a group formedto support the families of prisoners of war and those missing inaction in Southeast Asia.   In his brief comments, Bush made no comment about the proposedswap advanced by Israel's Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.   Before Bush made his comments, Dole said that if the reports ofHiggins' killing were true, he hoped the administration woulid have``an appropriate response. I'm not certain when an appropriateresponse would be, but I'm certain there should be a response,'' hesaid.   Dole also said that if the reports of Higgins' death were true,``the I would hope the Israelis would take another look at some oftheir actions that they must know in advance would endangerAmerican lives.''   Dole said he hoped Bush could ``have some understanding with theIsraelis about future conduct which, I've indicated, endangers thelives of Americans.''</TEXT></DOC>
