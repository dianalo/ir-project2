In furtherance of that goal,Congress established the Consumer Product Safety Commission as an independentregulatory agency, and granted it broad authority to promulgate mandatorysafety standards for consumer products as a necessary alternative to industryself-regulation, 15 U.S.C. 2056(a)(1)(A). The Commission was also giventhe authority to require manufacturers to provide consumer label warningsor instructions about their products, 15 U.S.C. 2056(a)(2), and to promulgatestandards for products falling under the purview of the Refrigerator SafetyAct, 15 U.S.C. 1211-1214, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970,15 U.S.C. 1471-1476, the Flammable Fabrics Act, 15 U.S.C. 1191-1204, andthe Federal Hazardous Substances Act, 15 U.S.C. 1261-1274. As originallyenacted, neither the Consumer Product Safety Act nor the other statutesadministered by the Commission contained any language referring to voluntarystandards. In 1978, the Commission issued regulations describing the extent and formof Commission involvement in the development of voluntary standards, 43FR 19216, 16 CFR Part 1032_Commission Involvement in Voluntary StandardsActivities. In the Background section, the Commission acknowledged thecontribution which voluntary standards had made to reducing hazards associatedwith consumer products, and stated that it supported an effective voluntarystandards program. Nonetheless, the Commission asserted that ``While theremight be circumstances in which a particular voluntary standard can substitutefor a mandatory standard, the Commission generally views voluntary standardsas complementary to and not a substitute for mandatory standards''. Itstated, also, its belief that a proper combination of voluntary and mandatorystandards can have a higher ``payoff'' in increased product safety thaneither mandatory or voluntary activities alone could have. In 1981, Congress amended the Consumer Product Safety Act, the FederalHazardous Substances Act, and the Flammable Fabrics Act, to mandate thatthe Commission give preference to voluntary standards over promulgatingmandatory standards, if it determines that a voluntary standard will eliminateor adequately reduce an injury risk, and that there will be a likelihoodof substantial compliance with the standard. 15 U.S.C. 2056(b), 15 U.S.C.1262(g)(2), 15 U.S.C. 1193(h)(2). The amendments also require the Commissionto provide administrative and technical assistance to organizations engagedin voluntary standards development. 15 U.S.C. 2054(a) (3) and (4). Thereafter, the Commission conducted its activities in accordance withthe policies of the 1981 Amendments by deferring to voluntary standardsin those cases where a voluntary standard would adequately reduce an unreasonablerisk of injury and there was a reasonable likelihood of substantial compliancewith the standard. However, the Commission's plicy statement in 16 CFRPart 1032 is inconsistent with the policy stated in the 1981 Amendments.The purpose of this proposed revision is to conform the Commission's policystatement with the 1981 Amendments. The proposed Part 1031 also incorporates, with changes, the provisionsof current 16 CFR Part 1031, the Commission's regulations governing organizations,which were initially promulgated on June 20, 1975. 40 FR 26023. The Partspecifies which Commission officers and employees can be members of voluntarystandards bodies or can participate in voluntary standards developmentactivities. Each substantive change is explained below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Changes and Additions in Proposed Part 1031 </ITAG>Subpart A, General Policies, is a revision of current 16 CFR Part 1032,Commission Involvement in Voluntary Standards Activities. The proposedSubpart A is substantially the same as existing Part 1032, except as describedbelow. Section 1031.1(b) has been added to define ``voluntary standards bodies''and ``voluntary standards development bodies''. The definitions are similarto those in OMB Circular A-119 and reflect the language Congress employedin Section 5(a) (3) and (4) of the Consumer Product Safety Act as to whichorganizations the Commission should assist in voluntary standards activities,i.e., ``public and private organizations or groups of manufacturers.''The definitions are stated in broad terms so as to encompass any organizationthat has the capability of developing a voluntary standard. Section 1031.2, Background, a complete revision of current andSection; 1032.1,explains the policy of the Commission regarding voluntary standards. Section1031.2(b) explains the statutory requirements of the 1981 Amendments regardingvoluntary standards. Section 1031.2(c) describes the policies set forthin Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-119 pertaining to federalparticipation in the development and use of voluntary standards. The Circularencourages government participation in the standards-related activitiesof voluntary standards bodies and standards-developing groups when suchparticipation is in the public interest and is compatible with the agencies'missions, authorities, priorities, and budget resources. Section 1031.3, Consumer Product Safety Act Amendments, incorporates thetext of several sections from the Act, as amended in 1981, which pertainto the Commission's participation in the development and use of voluntarystandards. The provisions are provided in the text of the regulation forthe reader's convenience. Section 1031.4(a)(2) modifies current andSection; 1032.6(a)(2), so that oneof the criteria for the Commission's determination that a voluntary standardis adequate to eliminate or reduce a risk of injury associated with a consumerproduct is changed from the language that ``there is a sufficiently highdegree of conformance to the voluntary standard'' to language ``it is likelythat there will be substantial compliance with the voluntary standard.''The proposed new language reflects provisions in the 1981 Amendments thatallow the Commission to defer to proposed voluntary standards under appropriatecircumstances.Section 1032.6(b) in the current regulations is deleted since it is inconsistentwith the 1981 Amendments.Section 1031.4(b) is a new provision that provides for the Commission toinitiate a proceeding for the development of a mandatory standard in theevent it determines there is no voluntary standard that will eliminateor adequately reduce a risk of injury.Section 1031.4(c) revises the language in current 16 CFR 1032.6(d), whichrequires the Commission to consider the provisions of a voluntary standardwhen it initiates a development proceeding under ``Section 7 of the ConsumerProduct Safety Act.'' As originally enacted, section 7, referred to asthe ``offeror process'', provided that the Commission could solicit ``offers''from private sector organizations to develop a mandatory standard. However,section 7 was revised by the 1981 Amendments to abolish the ``Offeror process'';thus, reference to that section is inappropriate. The proposed andSection;1031.4(c) references, instead, section 9 of the Consumer Product SafetyAct, the current provision prescribing the process for issuing a mandatoryconsumer product safety rule.Section 1031.5 sets forth the criteria for Commission participation involuntary standards activities. It is the same criteria set forth in current16 CFR 1032.5, except that two new criteria (paragraphs (a) and (b)) havebeen added to conform to criteria prescribed by the 1981 Amendments.Section 1031.5(f) provides criteria superseding the criterion set forthin current 16 CFR 1032.5(e) for Commission consideration to determine whetherto participate in the development of a voluntary standard. The currentprovision merely requires that the Commission consider the degree and ascertainabilityof industry conformance with a voluntary standard once it is issued. Theproposed section requires the Commission to consider any reasonable industryarrangements for achieving substantial industry compliance with a voluntarystandard once it is issued and the means of ascertaining such compliancebased on overall market share of product production. The latter requirementsreflects the Congressional direction that, in most instances, complianceshould be measured in terms of complying consumer products rather thanin terms of the number of complying industry members. See the ConferenceReport to accompany H.R. 3982, H.R. REP. No 97-208, 97th Cong., 1st Sess.871 (1981).Section 1031.6(c)(1) replaces and revises current 16 CFR 1032.(b)(2), whichdescribes examples of Commission participation in voluntary standards activities,by adding language allowing the Commission to provide administrative assistance(e.g., travel costs, hosting meetings, and performing secretarial functions)in support of the development and implementation of voluntary standards.This provision is derived from Section 5 of the Consumer Product SafetyAct, as amended in 1981.Section 1031.6(d) is added to conform to the policy set forth in OMB CircularA-119 that, normally, agencies should not provide greater support to avoluntary standards activity than that of all the non-federal participants.Section 1031.7(a)(7) replaces and revises 16 CFR 1032.4(b)(7) by addinga clause that indicates that the Commission's support of voluntary standardsactivities may include encouraging states and local governments to participatein government or industrial model code development activities so as todevelop uniformity and to minimize conflicting state and local regulations,as provided by section 2(b)(3) of the Consumer Product Safety Act.Section 1031.7(a)(8) provides a new example of the type of support theCommission may use in assisting voluntary standards development, i.e.,monitoring the number and market share of products conforming to a voluntarysafety standard. This will enable the Commission to ascertain industrycompliance with a voluntary standard by market share.Section 1031.7(a)(10) is a new provision. It acknowledges that one formof Commission support for voluntary standards development is providingfor the involvement of agency personnel in voluntary standards activitiesas described in Subpart B of this proposed regulation.Sections 1031.7 (11) and (12) are new provisions. They indicate that theCommission may provide administrative and financial support to a voluntarystandards development activity, as authorized by the 1981 Amendments.Section 1031.8 is a new provision. It describes the functions of the VoluntaryStandards Coordinator, a Commission employee responsible for coordinatingagency participation in voluntary standards activities and managing thevoluntary standards program.Subpart B, Employee Involvement in Voluntary Standards Activities, supersedes16 CFR Part 1031. The Proposed subpart has the same general effect as currentPart 1031 except for the changes noted below.Section 1031.9(c)(1) revises current andSection; 1031.1(a) to state thatthe Commission's participation in voluntary standards programs is consistentwith the federal policy set forth in OMB Circular No. A-119, as well asthe Consumer Product Safety Act and other statutes administered by theCommission.Section 1031.9(c)(4) is a new provision. It states that Commission employeeparticipation in voluntary standards activities should take into accountCommission resources and priorities. This provision conforms to languagein the legislative history of the 1981 Amendments directing the Commissionto consider its resources and priorities when determining what assistanceit will provide to voluntary standards development. Conference Report toH.R. 3982, p. 884.Section 1031.10 is a new section. It defines, for the purpose of SubpartB on employee involvement in voluntary standards activities, the termsmembership, participation, monitoring, observation, and communication.Section 1031.11(b) is a new provision which requires employees, who participatein the development of a voluntary standard and then later advise the Commissionregarding that standard, to advise the Commission on the extent of theirinvolvement. Also, the provision requires that evaluations and recommendationsby such employees should strive to be as objective as possible and shouldbe reviewed by higher level Commission officials prior to submission tothe Commission.Section 1031.12(a) lists those Commission officials who may not becomemembers of a voluntary standards group because they have the responsibilityfor making final decisions, or objectively advising those who make finaldecisions, on whether to rely on a voluntary standard, promulgate a consumerproduct safety standard, or to take other action to prevent or reduce anunreasonable risk of injury associated with a product. The list is thesame as that in current andSection; 1031.4, except that Program Managersin the Office of Program Management and Budget have been deleted becausetheir work and recommendations are reviewed by supervisory officials beforebeing given to the Commission. It has also been revised to reflect theCommission's functions regarding voluntary standards which emanate fromthe 1981 Amendments, i.e., to determine whether a voluntary standard willadequately address a problem involving an unreasonable risk. The predecessorprovision referred to the Commission's functions relating to the ``offerorprocess'' which, as noted above, was abolished by the 1981 Amendments.Section 1031.12(c) is a new provision. It requires employees who have obtainedapproval from the Executive Director to accept membership in a voluntarystandards organization to so inform the General Counsel and the VoluntaryStandards Coordinator prior to their acceptance. This will allow the GeneralCounsel and the Voluntary Standards Coordinator to be aware of the membershipand an opportunity for them to provide any necessary guidance to the employee.Section 1031.12(d) is a new provision that requires employees who seekmembership in a voluntary standards organization in their individual capacityto seek approval from the Commission's Ethics Official in accordance withthe Commission's Employee Standards of Conduct, 16 CFR Part 1030.Section 1031.13(a), like its predecessor provision andSection; 1031.4(d),provides that Commission employees, except for those who are specificallylisted, may participate in or monitor voluntary standards development.The proposed provision differs from its predecessor in that it requiresapproval for employee participation or monitoring by the employee's supervisorand any other person required to do so by internal agency management procedures,whereas approval under the current unrevised regulations is required tobe given by the Executive Director alone.Section 1031.14, Observation criteria, supersedes current andSection; 1031.5(d).The proposed provision requires employees who wish to attend voluntarystandards meetings for the sole purpose of observation to obtain approvalfrom their supervisor and any other person required to approve pursuantto internal agency management procedures. Under the current provision,approval must be provided by the Executive Director. The proposed provisionalso requires the employee to notify the Voluntary Standards Coordinatorprior to observing a voluntary standard meeting.Section 1031.15, Communication criteria, is a new provision providing theconditions for officials and employees to communicate with voluntary standardsgroups and representatives.Commission officials and employees, who are authorized to be members ofa voluntary standards group in their official capacity under andSection;1031.12(b), may communicate with a voluntary standard group or representativeincidental to their membership. Likewise, those officials or employees,who are approved to participate in or monitor a voluntary standard developmentunder andSection; 1031.13 (a) and (b), may communicate with the voluntarystandard body or its representatives as part of their approved participationin, or monitoring of, a standard under development.Agency employees and officials who do not fall within either of the abovecategories, and are not prohibited from membership in a voluntary standardsorganization by virtue of andSection; 1031.12 (a), may be authorized to communicatewith a voluntary standards body or representative on substantive matters,sas defined in andSection; 1031.15 (a) (1). Approval must be given by theperson to whom an employee would apply to obtain approval for participationor monitoring pursuant to andSection; 1031.13. Those same employees and officialsmay communicate with a voluntary standards group or representative on non-substantivematters within the scope of their duties without specific authorization.Substantive matters are defined in andSection; 1031.15 (a) (1) as those mattersthat pertain to the formulation of the technical aspects of a specificvoluntary standard or the course of conduct for developing a voluntarystandard. Non-substantive matters would include those relating to schedulingmeetings, obtaining status reports, and other administrative matters.Section 1031.15(b) is a new provision. It requires that employees communicatewith voluntary standards organizations in accordance with any internalagency procedures designed to assure staff review and consensus.Section 1031.15 (c) is a new provision. It provides that the Commissionerscan engage in written communications with voluntary standards bodies orrepresentatives on voluntary standards matters providing they state thatany substantive views expressed are only their individual views, and notnecessarily those of the Commission acting in its collegial capacity. Thisprovision changes the present regulation in andSection; 1031.5_self-imposedby the Commission in 1978_that precludes the Commissioners for personallycommunicating with voluntary standards organizations concerning the developmentof voluntary standards. The new provision permits the Commissioners toactivity encourage and support the development and use of voluntary standardto alleviate product hazards. The disclaimer is intended to preclude anymisunderstanding on the part of a recipient of a letter as to whether theviews expressed therein are those of the individual Commissioner or thoseof the Commission. Of course, the Commission may always communicate withparties on voluntary standards matters upon which they agree in their officialcollegial capacity. Section 1031.15 (d) is a new provision. It requires that Commission officialsand employees furnish a copy of each written communication of a substantivenature, and a report of each substantive oral conversation with voluntarystandards groups or individuals, to the Voluntary Standards Coordinator.This requirement will enable the Coordinator to monitor all the voluntarystandards activities the Commission and its employees are engaged in. <ITAG tagnum="84">Certification of No Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et. seq.) requires that whenevera federal agency publishes a proposal under the Administrative ProcedureAct (5 U.S.C. 553), it must give particular consideration to small businesses,small non-profit organizations, and small local governments (collectivelycalled ``small entities''). The proposed regulations, if issued on a finalbasis, will be only for the information of the public and industry. Theywill not have the force of law, and will not impose any substantive obligationor duty on any person or firm, including any small firm. Therefore, inaccordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commissioncertifies that the proposed regulations, if issued on a final basis, willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations</ITAG>The proposal published below will have little or no potential for affectingthe human environment.

Subpart A sets forth general policies on Commission participation,and Subpart B sets forth policies and guidelines on employee involvementin voluntary standards activities.(b) For purposes of both Subpart A and Subpart B of this Part 1031, voluntarystandards bodies are private sector domestic or multinational organizationsor groups, or combinations thereof, such as, but not limited to, all non-profitorganizations, industry associations, professional and technical societies,institutes, and test laboratories, that are involved in the planning, development,establishment, revision, review or coordination of voluntary standards.Voluntary standards development bodies are voluntary standards bodies,or their sub-groups, that are devoted to developing or establishing voluntarystandards.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1031.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Background.</ITAG>(a) Congress enacted the Consumer Product Safety Act in 1972 to protectconsumers against unreasonable risks of injury associated with consumerproducts. In order to achieve that goal, Congress established the ConsumerProduct Safety Commission as an independent regulatory agency, and grantedit broad authority to promulgate mandatory safety standards for consumerproducts as a necessary alternative to industry self regulation.(b) In 1981, the Congress amended the Consumer Product Safety Act, theFederal Hazardous Substances Act, and the Flammable Fabrics Act, to requirethe Commission to rely on voluntary standards rather than promulgate amandatory standard when voluntary standards would eliminate or adequatelyreduce the risk of injury addressed and it is likely that there will besubstantial compliance with the voluntary standards. (15 U.S.C. 2056(b),15 U.S.C. 1262(g)(2), 15 U.S.C. 1193(h)(2)). The 1981 Amendments also requirethe Commission, after any notice or advance notice of proposed rulemaking,to provide technical and administrative assistance to persons or groupswho propose to develop or modify an appropriate voluntary standard. (15U.S.C. 2054(a)(3)). Additionally, the amendments encourage the Commissionto provide technical and administrative assistance to groups developingproduct safety standards and test methods, taking into account Commissionresources and priorities (15 U.S.C. 2054(a)(4)). Although the Commissionis required to provide assistance to such groups, it may determine thelevel of assistance in accordance with the level of its own administrativeand technical resources and in accordance with its assessment of the likelihoodthat the groups being assisted will successfully develop a voluntary standardthat will preclude the need for a mandatory standard.(c) In 1982, the Office of Management and Budget revised Circular No. A-119,Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Standards.The Circular establishes the policy to be followed by executive agencies,including the Commission, in working with voluntary standards bodies andin adopting and using voluntary standards. The Circular encourages governmentparticipation in the standards-related activities of voluntary standardsbodies and standards-developing groups when such participation is in thepublic interest and is compatible with the agencies' missions, authorities,priorities, and budget resources. The Circular recognizes, however, thatvoluntary standards activities, if improperly conducted, can suppress freeand fair competition, impede innovation and technical progress, excludesafer and less expensive products, or otherwise adversely affect trade,commerce, health, or safety. Thus, agencies are urged to take full accountof the impact on the economy, applicable Federal laws, polices and nationalobjectives, including, for example, laws and regulations relating to antitrust,national security, small business, product safety, environment, technologicaldevelopment, and conflicts of interest.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1031.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Consumer Product Safety Act amendments.</ITAG>The Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended, contains several sectionspertaining to the Commission's participation in the development and useof voluntary standards.(a) Section 7(b) provides that the Commission shall rely on voluntary consumerproduct safety standards prescribing requirements described in subsection(a) whenever compliance with such voluntary standards would eliminate oradequately reduce the risk of injury addressed and it is likely that therewill be substantial compliance with such voluntary standards. (15 U.S.C.2056(b)).(b) Section 5(a)(3) provides that the Commission shall, following publicationof an advance notice of proposed rulemaking or a notice of proposed rulemakingfor a product safety rule under any rulemaking authority administered bythe Commission, assist public and private organizations or groups of manufacturers,administratively and technically, in the development of safety standardsaddressing the risk of injury identified in such notice. (15 U.S.C. 2054(a)(3)).(c) Section 5(a)(4) provides that the Commission shall, to the extent practicableand appropriate (taking into account the resources and priorities of theCommission), assist public and private organizations or groups of manufacturers,administratively and technically, in the development of product safetystandards and test methods. 15 U.S.C. 2054(a)(4).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1031.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Effect of voluntary standards activities on Commission activities.</ITAG>(a)(1) The Commission, in determining whether to begin proceedings to developmandatory standards under the acts it administers, considers whether mandatoryregulation is necessary or whether there is an existing voluntary standardthat adequately addressed the problem and the extent to which that voluntarystandard is complied with by the affected industry. (2) The Commission acknowledges that there are situations in which adequatevoluntary standards, in combination with appropriate certification programs,may be appropriate to support a conclusion that a mandatory standard isnot necessary. The Commission may find that a mandatory standard is notnecessary where compliance with an existing voluntary standard would eliminateor adequately reduce the risk of injury associated with the product, containsrequirements and test methods that have been evaluated and found acceptableby the Commission, and it is likely that there will be substantial compliancewith the voluntary standard. Under such circumstances, the Commission mayagree to encourage industry compliance with the voluntary standard andsubsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the standard in terms of accidentand injury reduction for products produced in compliance with the standard.(3) In evaluating voluntary standards, the Commission will relate the requirementsof the standard to the identified risks of injury and evaluate the requirementsin terms of their effectiveness in eliminating or reducing the risks ofinjury. The evaluation of voluntary standards will be conducted by Commissionstaff members, including representatives of legal, economics, engineering,epidemiological, health sciences, human factors, other appropriate interests,and the Voluntary Standards Coordinator. The staff evaluation will be conductedin a manner similar to evaluations of standards being considered for promulgationas mandatory standards. (4) In the event that the Commission has evaluated an existing voluntarystandard and found it to be adequate in all but one or two areas, the Commissionmay defer the initiation of a mandatory rulemaking proceeding and requestthe voluntary standards organization to revise the standard to addressthe identified inadequacies expeditiously. In such cases, the Commissionmay monitor or participate in the development of these revisions. (b) In the event the Commission determines that there is not existing voluntarystandard that will eliminate or adequately reduce a risk of injury theCommission may commence a proceeding for the development of a consumerproduct safety rule or a regulation in accordance with section 9 of theConsumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. 2058, section 3(f) of the FederalHazardous Substances Act, 15 U.S.C. 1262(f), or section 4(a) of the FlammableFabrics Act, 15 U.S.C. 1193(g), as may be applicable. In commencing sucha proceeding, the Commission will publish an advance notice of proposedrulemaking which shall, among other things, invite any person to submitto the Commission an existing standard or portion of an existing standard,or to submit a statement of intention to modify or develop, within a reasonableperiod of time, a voluntary standard to address the risk of injury. (c) The Commission will consider those provisions of a voluntary standardthat have been reviewed, evaluated, and deemed to be adequate in addressingthe specified risks of injury when initiating a mandatory consumer productsafety rule or regulation under the Consumer Product Safety Act, the FederalHazardous Substances Act, or the Flammable Fabrics Act, as may be applicable.Comments will be requested in the advance notice of proposed rulemakingon the adequacy of such voluntary standard provisions. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1031.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Criteria for Commission participation in voluntary standards activities.</ITAG>The Commission will consider the extent to which the following criteriaare met in considering Commission participation in the development of voluntarysafety standards for consumer products: (a) The likelihood the voluntary standard will eliminate or adequatelyreduce the risk of injury addressed that that there will be substantialcompliance with the voluntary standard. (b) The likelihood that the voluntary standard will be developed withina reasonable period of time. (c) Exclusion, to the maximum extent possible, from the voluntary standardbeing developed, of requirements which will create anticompetitive effectsor promote restraint of trade. (d) Provisions for periodic and timely review of the standard, includingreview for anticompetitive effects, and revision or amendment as the needarises. (e) Performance-oriented and not design-restrictive requirements, to themaximum practical extent, in any standard developed. (f) Industry arrangements for achieving substantial industry compliancewith the voluntary standard once it is issued, and the means of ascertainingsuch compliance based on overall market share of product productions. (g) Provisions in the standard for marking products conforming to the standardso that future Commission investigation can indicate the involvement ofsuch products in accidents and patterns of injury. (h) Provisions for insuring that products identified as conforming to suchstandards will be subjected to a testing and certification (including self-certification)procedure, which will provide assurance that the products comply with thestandard. (i) The openness to all interested parties, and the establishment of procedureswhich will provide for meaningful participation in the development of suchstandards by representatives of producers, suppliers, distributors, retailers,consumers, small business and public interests.

(b) The Commission's interest in a specific voluntary standards activitywill be based in part on the frequency and severity of injuries associatedwith the product, the involvement of the product in accidents, the susceptibilityof the hazard to correction through standards, and the overall resourcesand priorities of the Commission. Commission involvement in voluntary standardsactivities generally will also be guided by the Commission's operatingplan and budget. (c) There are two levels of Commission involvement in voluntary standardsactivities, each of which reflects a different level of Commission involvementas set forth below: (1) <T3>Monitoring. </T3>Monitoring involves maintaining an awareness of thevoluntary standards development process through oral or written inquiries,receiving and reviewing minutes of meetings and copies of draft standards,or attending meetings for the purpose of observing and commenting duringthe standards development process in accordance with Subpart B of thispart.
