Instrument andHitachi with Philips NV on medical electronics, it is very hard to see theproposed collaborations between GEC and Siemens turning out anything like sorosy as the next bid documents for Plessey Co will seek to make them look -and the same question mark also hangs over the working out of the proposedGEC alliances with General Electric Co Inc.andM;Despite chairman Michael Blumenthal's commitment to turn Unisys Corp into a$20,000m company by the early 1990s, even with the Convergent Inc andTimeplex Inc acquisitions, turnover remains stubbornly below the $10,000mmark - DEC was up at $11,800m for its year to June - after a dull fourthquarter in which both turnover and profit growth were sluggish - see page 3.andM;Results from Borland International Inc, Apollo Computer Inc and PrimeComputer Inc and came through after we closed page three last night, Borlandshowing third quarter net down 6% at $874,000 and a none month loss of $4.9m;Prime turning in a $14.4m fourth quarter loss after taking $32.8m inconsolidation charges, leaving it with a $19m profit for the year; and Apollofourth quarter net profits down 68% to $3.2m; full figures tomorrow.andM;The US General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals has turneddown Honeywell Federal Systems protest against ATandamp;T Co's monster $4,500m Unixsystems contract from the US Air Force: Honeywell claims its own bid for thecontract was evaluated incorrectly, but the Board said that while there wereminor errors in the evaluation of both bids, there was no cause to refer themback to be reconsidered.andM;Tulip Computers UK of Crawley, West Sussex has a new 16MHz 80386SX machine,the SX Compact 2 which costs $2,000 for the 20Mb version, $2,250 for the 40Mbversion: the machine has a standard internal memory of 1Mb, expandable to 3Mbon the motherboard, with Expanded Memory Support version 4.0 provided throughan on system chip set, to provide access to memory beyond the 640Kb limit forMS-DOS programs that support EMS memory; despite its diminutive 12&quot;footprint, the box has three full expansion slots.andM;London NW-based HM Systems Plc has teamed up with Softech Communications toenable HM's Minstrel workstation to send or receive facsimiles directly, oncompatible personal computers or Group III fax machines; users can receivefaxes while working on other tasks, with the messages saved till they'reneeded.andM;Sybase Inc, Emeryville, California has been signed by IBM to implement theSybase Relational database system for IBM's RT Unix boxd Sybase is already onthe IBM System 88 and the Sybased SQL Server will soon be available on thePS/2s under OS/2.andM;Oracle Corp, Belmont, California says that Professional Oracle for MS-DOSVersion 5.1B is available: it includes new application tools and utilitiesfor both real mode and protected mode above the 640Kb memory line, enablingdevelopment of applications with up to 1Mb of code and 15Mb of data forlarger machines that run Oracle; the new release ships next week at $1,300.andM;Former White House Chief of Staff - and, for those old enough to remember,luminary of the Watergate hearings - Howard Baker is one of eight veryheavyweight members who will sit on Memorex Telex NV's Supervisory Board ofDirectors: other members named by Memorex president Giorgio Ronchi are formercongressman William Brock;
