 As you'll understand as you read on, we recommend Omnipage.andP;  AccuracyOCR accuracy is affected by at least five factors.andP;  They  are:andM;The brand and quality of the scanner; The type of document typeset,andM;typewritten, dot-matrix, and others); The quality of the original documentandM;(soiled, faded, a third-generation photocopy, etc.);andM;The format of the document tables and rows of figures, paragraph inden-andM;tation, multiple columns with imbedded graphics);andM;The destination of the data (word processing, desktop publishing,andM;spreadsheet, online text retrieval).andP;  Although we would like to be able topresent you a definitive, quantitative answer as to which product you shouldbuy, we can't.andP;  To do so, we would have to test the exact kinds of documentsthat you will be scanning - an almost impossible task since there arecountless document types.andM;Specifically, we would have to construct a five dimensional matrix.andP;  Therewould be up to twenty entries for scanner types, ten entries for documentquality.andP;  In fact, if we estimate ten entries for each dimension-erring hereon the small side-we end up with ten to the fifth power, or 100,000 tests foreach product.andP;  At a minimum of three trials per test and two packages, thatis 600,000 scannings (each of which must be proof read by hand).andM;Most testers would pick a subset of these and try to extrapolate the results.andO;We did, and we werc not happy with our results.andM;For extrapolation to work, you must have two things: the system you arestudying must contain no unknown variables and the tester must be able tocontrol all the variables.andM;For our extrapolation, we chose six documents that we consideredrepresentative of typical business use.andP;  They were a typewritten letter, alaser-printed letter, a typewritten financial table, a laser-printedfinancial table, the front page of the Outlook, and a Power of Attorneycontract that we purchased at an office supply store.andM;Intcrestingly, we found that OmniPage and TrueScan performed only slightlydiffcrently.andM;We found that OmniPage tended to be more accurate in recognizing individualcharacters while TrueScan held the edge in better formatting recognition suchas preserving justified margins.andP;  For every three OmniPage errors, two wouldbe formatting errors.andP;  However, for every three TrueScan errors, only one wasformatting while the other two were mis-read characters.andM;Based on total errors, OmniPage did about 10% better.andP;  Remember that thesecomparisons are for the test documents we selected to use, and while they maybe a representative sampling, other documents could have been chosen to skewthe results in a different direction.andP;  We can't test enough documents for ourresults to generalize to your own use.andP;  There are just too many differentkinds of documents in use today and the performance of OCR products variestoo greatly across those diffcrent documents for numbers to  be meaningful.andM;This became apparent to us when we scanned the Power of Attorney form anddiscovered that one of the programs did more than ten times worse than theother.andP;  Then, on the spreadsheet document with multiple columns, the resultswerc reversed.andM;That means two things.andP;  First, scanner companies will be able to manipulatenumbers to show whatever they want to regarding their products.andP;  Second,unless someone tests with the same documents you're going to use, their testswill be meaningless to you.andP;  In other words, the most important thing todetermine before you buy a scanner and OCR package is what kind of documentsyou want to scan.andP;  However, before you make any decisions regarding scanning,please read the section 'Ease of Use' of this article.andP;  As you'll sec, thiswill be most revealing as to the appropriateness of scanning for yourapplication.andM;It is important to realize that any combination of scanning products needs tobe 'tweaked' for best performance.andP;  It is not possible to simply setup thescanner, install the software, and scan.andP;  The results with any of thepackages on the market would be disappointing.andP;  However, if you regard ascanning system in the same light as your faithful copier you can understandthe adjustments which need to be made during the scanning process.andP;  For thisreason alone the &quot;Ease of Use&quot; section of this report is perhaps the mostimportant section since it discusses the methodology and techniques employedby the two companies in this regard.andP;  Host CPU speed We did encounter onequirk: when we moved from a 286 to a 386 machine, we found that OmniPage gota speed boost that TrueScan did not.andP;  OmniPage is much more able to takeadvantage of increased CPU power.andP;  This is attributable to OmniPage's greateruse of the host CPU, while TrueScan does most of its work on its add-inboard.andP;  The add-in board does not work any faster when installed in a fasterhost machine.andP;  Ease of use The biggest difference we found between OmniPageand TrueScan was in their user interfaces, and therefore, their case ofoperation.andP;  They exemplify two opposite approaches to software interfaces:the batch-oriented, command-line world of MS-DOS (and the mainframe past),and the graphical user in- terface (GUI/Windows), interactive world of themicro and workstation future.andM;TrueScan comes from Calera Recognition Systems, a company that has beenmaking OCR products for minicomputers and mainframes for years.andP;  TheirTrueScan product is a scaled-down, less expensive version of their largesystem products, and has many features that come from that heritage.andM;While using TrueScan is extremely easy, the very nature of the user interfacelimits your ability to make adjustments and/or corrections on the fly.andP;  Ifyou have used DOS, you know how to enter a command.andP;  With TrueScan, you say&quot;SCANTEXT&quot; (or &quot;SCANING&quot; to scan in an image) and it starts scanning.andP;  Itasks you at the end of each page if you have more pages, or if you're done.andO;You end up with data in the file format of your choice.andM;TrueScan works on any text based display, and the software is memoryresident.andP;  By running &quot;SCANTEXT&quot; a user can begin scanning, using the defaultsettings.andP;  By running  TRUESCAN' a user can pick and choose op- tionsettings, such as contrast, file format, gray scales, and so on, all fromstatic menus.andP;  TrueScan is more than user-friendly, it is novice-friendly.andO;Any computer-phobe could use it easily.andM;However, TrueScan is limited by its text based interface.andP;  Its ease of use isachieved by the old strategy of limiting the user's options.andP;  That is onlyappropriate when the user is someone who doesn't want to know what'shappening under the hood, and doesn't want to be able to find out.andP;  Since thescanning process by its very nature needs to be interactive and is not a point and shoot' situation, being able to determine the quality of the scanas it is occurring is a very important feature, and one which TrueScan doesnot support.andP;  Dirty fingernails OmniPage is another matter.andM;OmniPage offers all the benefits of a graphical user interface.andP;  In short, itembodies all that the coming decade of computing will offer.andP;  (If you arechoosing between these two programs, and you already own and loveWindows-based programs, then get OmniPage.andP;  It's that simple.)andM;Further, Caere Corporation also offers OmniPage in a Macintosh version.andP;  Thecompany has taken care to insure that the user interface and the innerworkings of both the Mac and IBM versions arc as close to being the same asis possible given the differences between the Macintosh operating system andthat of the Windows operating environment.andM;When running OmniPage, you arc running Windows.andP;  The OmniPage interface iswritten for Windows, and in fact comes with a run-time version of Windows2.03.andP;  That means that you'd better have an AT class machine or better to getacceptable performance-but you'd want that for any scanning platform, anyway.andO;Scanning is at least as resource-hungry as Windows is.andP;  And because you'rerunning Windows, you can cut, copy, and paste from one window to the next.andO;When OmniPage has scanned in an image, you can copy all or part of it, flipto PageMaker, and paste.andP;  When OmniPage has scanned a page of text, you cancopy a selection of that text from the program's preview window- withouthaving to save the file to disk-and paste elsewhere.andP;  For instance, we had noproblem moving freshly-scanned text directly to Ami, the Windows-based wordprocessor from Samna.andM;There arc other reasons we prefer OmniPage.andP;  It saves you time when you makean error.andP;  For example, each program will take the user through the samebasic set of steps: 1.andP;  loading a page, 2.andP;  choosing options, 3.andP;  scanning,4.andP;  recognizing, 5.andP;  and storing.andP;  The user has to be concerned with somethings that the software cannot do: which piece of paper to scan; what formatto save the file into; and what contrast level to set on the scanner.andP;  Afterall of these steps, including the five scanner steps, the user can open thenewly created file and see how well the process worked.andP;  Fault Tolerance Whenthe scanning docs not go well, it becomes important that OmniPage offers agreat deal more feedback, much earlier in the cycle.andP;  Problems mean that oneof several things must be changed, the most common being the scanner contrastsetting.andP;  But if the problem is not discovered until after the document isscanned, recognized, saved, and opened, much time has been wasted,particularly the recognition time, which usually represents most of theprocess time.andM;During a scan using OmniPage, the user sees a scanner's-eye view of thedocument, and can immediately see whether there will be problems inrecognition.andP;  (Displaying this on the screen means extra work for theapplication, but OmniPage is nevertheless about as fast as TrueScan.)andO;OmniPage offers a character window, which displays a 300dot per-inch blowupof the part of the page that's being scanned.andP;  With a light document, oftenthe letter 'd' will show up as a 'c' and an 'l' side by side, turning'dear'into'clear'.andP;  Unfortunately, this is the sort of error that your wordprocessor spell checker will not catch.andM;That same light document will look, in OmniPage's character window, washedout and broken up.andP;  The most inexperieneed scanner user will immediatelyperceive the problem, and will darken the contrast setting much as he wouldat the copier.andP;  And, instead of discovering something amiss after half anhour's scanning, the user has discovered the problem within thirty seconds.andM;(By the way, the Windows GUI has an interesting side benefit.andP;  OmniPage hasthe EXACT same user interface in both its PC and its Mac versions.andP;  There wasno retraining time needed to switch between the two.)andM;Here is a practical example of the use of scanning.andP;  A branch office sends atwenty page report to headquarters.andP;  The manager decides to use the report,rewritten, of course, for the company newsletter.andM;The first problem arises when the user begins scanning.andP;  Our user doesn'tnotice that he is putting the pages in upside down.andP;  Using TrueScan,our userhas no clue that anything is amiss until after all twenty pages are scannedand tries open it with Microsoft Word.andP;  Using OmniPage, on the other hand,our user sees immediately that the characters arc being read upside down andcorrects the prob- lem.andM;A second problem arises when our user puts page eight onto the glass, andaccidentally skews the page.andP;  Now the lines of text run diagonally instead ofstraight across the page.andP;  Once again, this goes unnoticed by the TrueScanuser, but is immediately seen by the OmniPage user.andP;  Where the first documentwill have one illegible page in the middle, the seeond will have all thepages scanned correctly.andM;A third problem comes when it turns out that the contrast setting on thescanner was too light, and letters are looking broken up and extremely thin.andO;To the scanner, the letter 'd' looks like 'cl.' Faint lines arc becominginvisible, and normal lines are becoming faint.andP;  And onec again, the TrueScanuser is clueless, but the OmniPage user can make a mid-flight coursecorrection.andP;  Ideology We think there's something fundamentally differentbetween the TrueScan and the OmniPage approaches, something far moreimportant than just saving thirty seconds here and thirty min- utes there.andO;It's a design philosophy, and an attitude.andM;The user can either be, as in the minds of system administrators and MISprofessionals everywhere, a troublemaker who causes down time and createsproblems, who needs to be chaperoned, controlled, and limited, or the usercan be, as in the minds of Apple Computer and many others, the basic unit ofcreativity, a resourec to be empowered, educated, and assisted in exploringpersonal limits and the limits of available technology.andM;Both kinds of users exist.andP;  The former arc those who know nothing aboutcomputers, who want to know nothing about computers, and who have scarcelyany opportunity to learn anything about computers.andP;  The latter are those whocan troubleshoot their own machines and software, who can help others, andwho can easily learn new things about computing.andP;  Both kinds of users arereally, at heart, the same people.andP;  The diffcrence is in how they arctreated, in how their hardware and software work, and in whether they arc ledthrough easy stages from bare proficiency to full mastery.andP;  ConclusionsPerhaps the first statement which needs to be made in summation of the abovetests and evaluations is that using a scanner requires some skill and anunderstanding of the process involved and the adjustments which can be madeto provide the best results.andP;  No product is capable of providing error freescanning results, and in fact, as a point of reference we used the Kurzweilhigh-end ($16,000) system as a bench mark device.andP;  As you can see from theresults, it too failed to provide 100% accurate scanning.andP;  When scanning adocument you are after the end result: the ability to turn a printed documentinto a file which can be easily converted into a computer readable form.andP;  Ifthe process is too cumbersome or time consuming, one might opt for having thedocument rekeyed into the computer.andP;  There is, thereforc, a finite measure ofpracticality (at least in the text world).andP;  Scanning a document shouldprovide a very expedi- tious method of converting the information containedon the printed page to machine readable format.andM;If it is more trouble to scan, rescan, and &quot;tweak&quot; a document than it is toretype it, there certainly is not advantage to having a scanner available.andO;Both of these products do provide the user with a better way of getting paperdocuments converted into machine readable form and both of these products doso at what we consider to be a good price/ performance ratio.andM;In evaluating both of these products we came to the following conelusions:andM;1) You must accept the fact that there will be some scanning errors whichneed to be corrected.andM;2) That if correcting these errors is more time consuming than retyping thedocument you are better off with no scanner at all.andM;3) Formatting errors are, by far, the easiest to find and to correct.andP;  Itbecomes very obvious when a formatting error exists but it is not nearly soobvious when a character error crecps into the file.andP;  In many of the testruns we found that if a character werc not recognized at all it was an easymatter to search the document for the character inserted in its place typically'-') and correct it, but the types of errors that really gave usproblems were the ones that changed a word from one  good&quot; one to another.andO;For example, scanning the word  dear' could result in the word 'clear'appearing in the text.andP;  Spelling correction programs arc quite good but theyare not yet designed to catch words which arc spelled correctly yet do notmake sense in a sentcnce.andM;4) Many of the documents scanned will be stored and portions of them will beused in the creation of other documents.andP;  In this case the format of theoriginal document is not an issue since the final document will most likelyrequire changes from the original format anyway.andM;Given the above, it is dear to us that OmniPage has a decided edge overTrueScan in all of the areas which we consider to be of prime importance ingetting the job done.andP;  They both work well,but OmniPage provides much moreinteraction for the end-user so that the process required to scan a documentand get it into acceptable form is shorter and easier to accomplish.andO;Consider, onee again, the office copier.andP;  How many times in the past have youhad to make repeated attempts at copying a page, each time changing thesettings? Wouldn't it be nice to have a preview of the quality of the outputbefore you run yet another copy? OmniPage provides exactly this feature withtheir preview window.andM;Finally, the world is moving towards graphical user interfaces andmulti-tasking systems.andP;  OmniPage runs under Windows permitting it to becomepart of a production system, not a stand alone application which must beused, quit, and then the output moved into another document or page makeupprogram.andP;  OmniPage has been designed from the ground up as a program which isdesigned to be one of a series of tools which will be used in the preparationof other work.andP;  It is expected that you will scan, correct, format, and thenmove the results of your work to another program, be it a word proccssor,spreadsheet, or page makeup program.andP;  Utilizing OmniPage under Windows makesthis easy to do, and this too, adds to the speed of the entire process.andM;Our choice, OmniPage, delivers more of what the end-users are looking for.andO;It does a complex task very well and provides a level of user interactionthat is not resent in TrueScan.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
