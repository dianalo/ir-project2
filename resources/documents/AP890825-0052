The effort has been faring well despite Third World criticism ofIsrael's battle against the Palestinian uprising in the occupiedlands, Israeli ties with South Africa and Arab attempts to blockIsraeli inroads in the region.   ``Surprisingly, the Palestinian uprising has had little effect onAfrican nations seeking better relations with Israel,'' said NaomiChazan, an Africa expert at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.   Arens left for Nairobi on Thursday night and was to sign anagreement today with Kenya that provides for assistance in waterconservation, desert reclamation and soil preservation. Eightypercent of Kenya's land is arid and unsuitable for agriculture.   Military analysts say Kenya also received shipments ofsurface-to-surface missiles from Israel last year.   In return for such aid, one highly placed Foreign Ministry sourcesaid, African nations are ``expected to show good will and abstainfrom voting on anti-Israel resolutions in the United Nations.''   Thirty African nations broke relations with Israel during the1973 Middle East war in a show of support for Israel's Arabadversaries.   Since then, black Africa has joined forces with Arab and Eastbloc nations in repeatedly censuring Israel in the United Nations.But Israeli officials see this situation as turning around.   ``In the last seven years, we are slowly but surely regaining our1973 position in Africa,'' said Meir Yoffe, head of the African deskat the Foreign Ministry.   Chazan said, however, that this is ``a gradual and incrementalprocess. Israel will probably not entirely regain its formerstatus.''   Seven countries have resumed full relations with Israel in recentyears, including Liberia, the Ivory Coast, Togo, Cameroon, Zaire andmost recently, Kenya and the Central African Republic. Israel has adiplomatic representative in Ghana operating through the SwissEmbassy.   Malawi, Swaziland and Lesotho never broke ties.   The diplomatic thaw is a result of political changes in theregion and a decline in Arab aid resulting from dwindling oilrevenues.   The 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty that normalized relationsbetween the former enemies led African countries to feel it waspermissible to resume relations, Yoffe said.   The Palestine Liberation Organization, which for years demandedIsrael be destroyed, last year accepted the Jewish state's right toexist, giving Kenya ``just the opportunity it was waiting for. Thisgave legitimacy to its action,'' said a source who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Israeli sources say African countries often threaten to resumeties with Israel as leverage to gain aid from Arab countries.   Israel has much to offer Africa. Two-thirds desert itself, Israelhas perfected rough-and-ready agricultural techniques suitable toAfrica's arid climate and rugged conditions.   ``Our advisers go out into the bush while other advisers stay attheir hotels in the capital,'' Yoffe said.   A defense data bank in London reports that Israel also isproviding military hardware and training to African nations.   Reports say Zairean President Sese Seko Mobuto's palace guard isIsraeli-trained, and Israeli advisers are reportedly active inEthiopia, Cameroon, Liberia and Guinea.   Unconfirmed reports speak of Israel sending advisers and militarysupplies to Gambia, the Cenral African Republic, Chad, Uganda andSierra Leone.   ``It is in Israel's interest to keep African countries stablepolitically,'' a senior Israeli source said on condition ofanonymity.   Israeli development projects in Africa now total $400 million, 60percent of which is in countries that do not have relations withIsrael, senior government sources said.   Nigeria, an African nation with a large Moslem population and noformal ties with Israel, is the largest recipient of Israelitechnical aid, they said.   ``Nigeria is an important and influential state,'' Chazan said.``Everyone is watching it and wondering whether it will resumerelations with Israel.''   Parallel to Israeli advances, the PLO has established a number ofoffices in African nations.   ``The African countries are using this to signal that Israel andthe Arabs are not mutually exclusive in Africa,'' Chazan said.</TEXT></DOC>
