The broad purposeof the IIIP is to determine if the diverse calibration procedures usedin different countries are equivalent. The general approach was to selectfour regional reference laboratories and entrust them with the detailsof project definition and execution. The four selected laboratories are:the Australian Radiation Laboratory (ARL), the US DOE Environmental MeasurementsLaboratory (EML), the US DOI Bureau of Mines (USBM), the UK NationalRadiological Protection Board (NRPB). The Organizing Committee that selectedthe four laboratories remained intact and served an oversight functionin all work to date. This report covers Part II of the IIIP, measurementsof radon daughters. In Phase I of this programme the four regional laboratoriescarried out side-by-side measurements on radon daughter test atmospheresin order compare radon daughter concentration, potential alpha energyconcentration (PAEC) and ''unattached'' fraction values. The resultsof these exercises showed no significant systematic differences betweenthe four laboratories for measurements of individual radon daughter concentrationsof for the potential alpha energy concentration. On the other hand, substantialdifferences were found in the measured ''unattached'' fractions. In PhaseII of the Part II IIIP, the four regional laboratories hosted radon daughterintercomparisons for laboratories within their respective regions. Theradon daughter test atmospheres and measurement protocols were similarto those used for Phase I.</TEXT></DOC>
