Israel reported that three Israelis and more than 40 Arabguerrillas were killed.   The Israeli military said in a statement issued late today inJerusalem that the two-day operation had ended and allparticipating Israeli forces had returned to their bases.   The Israeli military statement said 17 Israelis were wounded. Itsaid most of the Arab guerrillas killed were members of Hezbollah,Lebanon's most radical Shiite Moslem faction.   The army statement said Hezbollah guerrillas had expelled allthe residents from the village of Maydoun, some 12 miles north ofthe Israeli border, and were using the village as a launching pointfor attacks on Israeli forces and their Lebanese militia allies.   Dozens of Hezbollah guerrillas were in Maydoun when the fightingstarted today, the Israeli army command said. It said helicoptergunships and Israeli artillery destroyed the guerrillas' artilleryand vehicles with mounted anti-aircraft guns.   Israel identified two of the dead troopers as Capt. Boaz Ravidof Beit Ovad and Sgt. Marco Bernstein of Nahariya. The name ofthird dead Israeli was not immediately made public.   Security sources in south Lebanon said earlier today that theIsraeli soldiers died when the army stormed Shiite guerrilla bases.   A police spokesman, who like the security sources spoke oncondition of anonymity, said seven guerrillas were killed in theshootout around the villages of Maydoun and Ein el-Tineh in thesouthwestern sector of the Bekaa Valley.   The villages are five miles south of the town of Mashghara,where police said a 50-man Syrian garrison came under Israelihowitzer fire.   There was no immediate word on any Syrian casualties, and it wasnot known if the Syrians responded to the Israeli shellfire.   Mashghara is four miles west of the Israelis' forward positionsand is the Syrians' southern outpost in the western Bekaa.   The action was the first contact between the Syrians, who have16,000 troops in the Bekaa, and the Israelis since they pushed outof their self-designated border ``security zone'' Monday night toknock out guerrilla bases.   It was also the first time the Syrians have come under Israelifire in Lebanon since they were forced from south Lebanon in heavyfighting when the Israelis invaded in June 1982.   An Israeli armored column stormed bases manned by guerrillas ofHezbollah in hills overlooking Maydoun and Ein el-Tineh.   The villages are nine miles west of five villages the Israelissealed off Tuesday and searched for Palestinian guerrillas andallied Lebanese militiamen.   U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel said U.N. spotters saw an Israelihelicopter exchange fire with guerrillas in a dry riverbedsoutheast of Maydoun about 4:30 a.m. He said he could not confirmLebanese reports a helicopter was shot down.   The police spokesman said gunners of the Lebanese army lateropened up on Israeli tanks with Soviet-made 130mm howitzersdeployed near Lake Qaroun, about six miles east of Maydoun.   Security sources in south Lebanon reported that Israel sent twomore mechanized battalions into the area during the night, doublingthe size of their force to about 2,500 troops.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Tuesday he did notexpect the operation to provoke a confrontation with Syria,Israel's staunchest enemy. The Israeli operation in Lebanon is itslargest in two years.   The clashes in southern Lebanon occurred as Palestinianprotesters virtually shut down the Israeli-occupied West Bank andGaza Strip with a general strike.   At least 180 Arabs have been killed since the unrest began inthe occupied territories Dec. 8. An Israeli soldier and a Jewishteen-age settler also have been slain.   Police said hundreds of civilians fled villages near thesecurity zone during today's fighting.   Reporters in the Bekaa saw dozens of villagers carryingbelongings, blankets and mattresses heading for safer areas behindthe Syrian lines.   Shortly after today's advance, 500 Israeli soldiers beganwithdrawing from five Bekaa Valley villages. A police spokesmansaid the Israelis began pulling out of Ain Ata, Memis, Kfeer,Khalwat and Ain Zeta after ``completing the search.''   The spokesman said the Israelis rounded up several Lebanesemilitiamen allied with the Palestinians in the five villages andseized ``large quantities of weapons and ammunition.''   A resident of Khiam told reporters Israeli soldiers detained 30men in the village Tuesday. The Israeli army declined comment.   The Lebanese spokesman said the Israelis used police dogs inhouse-to-house searches in Ain Ata and nearby villages and calledon the population ``not to cooperate with saboteurs andaccomplices.''   Israel set up the security zone after it withdrew the bulk ofits army from Lebanon in 1985, three years after invading itsnorthern neighbor.</TEXT></DOC>
