East Brae isthe largest of the group, accounting for 40% of the Braearea's estimated 716 million barrels of oil reserves, and 54%of its natural gas reserves, which total about 2.79 trillioncubic feet.   Bow Valley's share of East Brae's development costs,including related pipeline expenditures, will total aboutC$275 million, Mr. Seaman said. Marathon Oil UK Ltd., a unitof Pittsburgh-based USX Corp., will operate the field.   Pending approval, production at East Brae is slated tobegin in late 1993, peaking in 1995 at a total expected dailyvolume of 155,000 barrels of oil or its equivalent. Thefigure includes natural gas volume of 300 million cubic feeta day, converted to barrels at a six-to-one ratio.   Bow Valley's share of East Brae's output is expected toboost the company's oil output by 33%, to 45,000 barrels aday by 1994, said Keith Lazelle, vice president, investorrelations. Bow Valley's natural gas production is expected torise by more than 40% during the same period, to 260 millioncubic feet a day, largely reflecting the impact of East Brae.   &quot;We did a study comparing the size and impact of East Braeto Caroline,&quot; said Mr. Seaman, referring to a large sour gasfield at Caroline, Alberta, that is 62%-owned byCalgary-based Shell Canada Ltd. The Caroline field, generallyregarded as Canada's largest gas find in recent years, haswon much industry attention in Canada. &quot;We found that EastBrae is at least as large a project, and will throw off morerevenue, than Caroline,&quot; he said.   Regulators in Alberta are expected to announce as early asFriday which of two competing development plans for theCaroline field has been approved. A C$825 million developmentproposal by Shell Canada, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group,an Anglo-Dutch concern, is competing with a rival plan byHusky Oil Ltd. Husky, which owns 12% of Caroline, is anaffiliate of Nova Corp. of Alberta.</TEXT></DOC>
