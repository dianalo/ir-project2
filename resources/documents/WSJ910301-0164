Ford Chairman Harold A. Poling told employees in aninternally televised speech yesterday that the company hopesto cut $3 billion from its annual operating costs. He saidFord has already trimmed $1.5 billion from operating costs.But the moves appear less stringent than similar cost-cuttingcampaigns at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. And someanalysts say more cuts will be needed to offset mountinglosses in Ford's core North American auto business.</LP><TEXT>   Ford's 52,000 white-collar workers will bear the brunt ofthe newest round of cost-cutting measures. &quot;It's becomeincreasingly clear that some salaried layoffs areinevitable,&quot; Mr. Poling said.   How many Ford salaried workers will be dismissedapparently will depend on how many others accept specialearly-retirement packages the company will offer workers aged55 to 62. If not many workers opt to retire early, a greaternumber of other employees will be fired. Mr. Poling didn'tspecify how many white-collar workers Ford wants to shed. ButFord President Philip E. Benton Jr. has said the companyneeds to trim its salaried work force by 6% to 7%.   Ford also will suspend merit pay and eliminate an accountused to cover medical costs and other costs for topmanagement in 1991; cut merit pay for other salaried workersby 25%; and cancel a $600-a-person increase in benefits forcertain lower-based professional workers.   By contrast, Ford's hourly workers have their benefitsprotected because of their union contract.   There are some perks that Ford isn't touching. Itsexecutives will continue to enjoy private dining rooms andfree cars that are maintained by the company. The cars areused by executives for &quot;evaluation&quot; purposes, a spokesmansaid.   In announcing these measures, Mr. Poling acknowledged thatFord will have a &quot;substantial loss&quot; in the first quarter. Andhe added that &quot;any recovery in automotive sales will be slowfor the balance of the year.&quot;   Ford, the most successful domestic auto maker of the1980s, lost $519 million, or $1.11 a share, in the fourthquarter. Some analysts are expecting even bigger losses inthe current quarter.   Indeed, some analysts said the magnitude of Ford's lossessuggests the company almost certainly will have to do evenmore to control costs. &quot;It's inconceivable to me that thecost cutting will end after this program,&quot; said analyst JohnCasesa of Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co.   Ford is expected to do more. It's widely anticipated thatthe company's board will move to cut the 75-cent-a-sharequarterly dividend in April. A 50% dividend cut could saveFord $700 million a year. General Motors paved the way forthis move by slashing its payout by 47%.   In some ways, however, Ford seems to be moving lessaggressively than its domestic rivals. When GM disclosedplans to cut its white-collar work force, the company setspecific targets of shedding 6,000 workers by the end of thisyear and 15,000 workers by 1993. Chrysler, the weakest of theBig Three, began a sweeping cost-reduction program in July1989.   The No. 3 U.S. auto maker, which said earlier this yearthat it had cut $2.5 billion from its annual expenses, istargeting $3 billion a year in savings -- the same goal Fordhas set.</TEXT></DOC>
