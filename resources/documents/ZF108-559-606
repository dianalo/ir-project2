conference, held in Cologne last month,Helmut Ricke, head of the newly-formed Telecom der Deutschen Post, told theaudience that the expansion and renovation of the East German telephonenetwork &quot;could cost $12,000m to $18,000m more than expected&quot;: Ricke, who hasorganised the development of the network into 10 areas handled by 10individual workgroups, estimates that the cost alone of bringing the networkup to West German standards will be about $18,000m - the sum originallycalculated for network expansion and the addition of various value-addedservices such as data communications, cellular telephony and cabletelevision; in fact, it will be these services which, according to the Rickeestimate, will mean that the overall cost could amount to some $36,000m.andM;- o -andM;And, touted as the first ever computer trade show in East Germany, theUnix-Forum show organised by Uniware Computer GmbH took place in East Berlinlast month: attended by over 1,500 delegates and 30 western hardware andsoftware companies, it included presentations by the Open Software Foundationand X/Open Co.andM;- o -andM;Cellnet Communications Ltd, the 60% British Telecommunications Plc-ownedcellular phone service subsidiary has launched a messaging service; the voicemessaging mailbox can be accessed from any phone and stores messages of up to60 seconds for a maximum of 72 hours: an alerter that bleeps when a messageis left can be added; charges for the service are set individually by Cellnetservice providers.andM;- o -andM;California Software Products Inc has released a new data security system forSystem 36 users and personal computers or PS/2s running the Baby/36 RPG IIsystem: Intercept/36 protects menu-driven applications by restricting accessto authorised users and automatically logging unauthorised attempts to accessrestricted data; it protects completed applications, menus, or individualjobs by means of identification and password; a random password generationfacility allows automatic regeneration and replacement of all passwordsacross protected menus, data and applications.andM;- o -andM;Software Publishing Corp, Mountain View, California has a new PFS: product,PFS:Preface 1.0, a menu system and MS-DOS manager designed to simplify thebasic functions of the machine: it is designed to enable novice andoccasional users to organise and manage applications and the contents oftheir hard disks without needing to know MS-DOS syntax, offering mouse orone-key access to applications, pull-down menus and file selector displays;it needs a double-sided floppy and a hard disk, a 512Kb system with at leasta ridiculous 325Kb of available memory, and MS-DOS 2.1 and above; it costs$70.andM;- o -andM;Scicon Networks Ltd is ready to start installations of its RISC-based 200Mbpsvoice and data ISDN Ringswitch: the ISDN Ringswitch, developed with CambridgeConsultants Ltd, consists of two fibre optic rings around which trafficcirculates in opposite directions - if one ring is broken, traffic isautomatically transferred to the other, and if both go down, the ring isconfigured to form a horse-shoe-shaped link with, claims Milton Keynes-basedScicon, no loss of performance; connection times are put at less than 100mS,and apart from use by any organisation that requires the level of faulttolerance it provides, Scicon also suggests that it could be well used aspart of a digital cellular network; the ISDN Ringswitch starts at around#30,000 for a single node, although Scicon reckons that most applications arebest served by a bare minimum of at least two nodes.andM;- o -andM;LS3, London Specialist Software Systems Ltd, has announced its new LS/400Assemble to Order software for the IBM AS/400: the company says that thesystem is specially designed for manufacturers that configure products fromcustomer-specified options at the time of order; product variations aredefined and communicated to the production and finance modules which areintegrated within LS/400 ATO; LS3 claims that it is the first standardassemble-to-order software product for the AS/400.andM;- o -andM;ICL has announced that six computer aided software engineering companies havejoined its CASE Partners Programme: the new partners are Learmonth andamp; BurchettManagement Systems, Ernst andamp; Young, Hoskyns, PA Consulting Group, ExceleratorUK, and the NCC with AIMS Systems; the six firms will integrate their toolswith ICL's Data Dictionary System and the Advanced Development Dictionarythat ICL acquired from the Sema Group to develop applications in Personal,VME, and Unix in-cluding Ingres and IDMSX databases.andM;- o -andM;Premier Systems (London) Plc is to supply the UDMS reportwriter as part ofits Venus financial software portfolio: UDMS was developed by InteractiveSolutions Inc and has recently been selected by Relational Technology as thereportwriter for its Ingres database; the modular UDMS runs under VAX/VMS andan Ultrix version is nearly ready; it is a menu-driven, window-based system,and up to 32 files can be joined in a relational data view; the databases mayinclude Oracle, RMS, Ingres, Sybase, RS/1, VAX-DBMS, and Rdb/Rdb-RT; the coremodules are Administration and Reportwriter; the optional modules are 4GLReportwriter or Data Man-ager, Enquiry, Export and Labels.andM;- o -andM;Nixdorf Computer AG has added three models to its CSC AT-based family ofself-service customer terminals: they can be configured with interactivevideo disks, printers and touch screens; Nixdorf says that a variety ofapplications can be developed under MS-DOS using Lynx, Creator, and Frame,Nixdorf's CSC software development tools; the M10 is an information andtransaction terminal containing an integrated statement or passbook printerto provide account statements and cheques; the M13 and M14 terminals havevideo disks for sales support or advertising; all three 80286-based machineshave 2Mb of main memory, a 50Mb fixed disk, and a 3.5&quot; floppy drive; theidentification unit reads and writes magnetic stripe cards to ISO 3554standard.andM;- o -andM;The Video Conferencing and Satellite Systems Division of Sony Corp of Americahas signed for Compression Labs Inc, San Jose's video codecs to integrateinto products.andM;- o -andM;Australian-born Ramtron Corp, Colorado Springs, which claims to have aningeniously simple technology for making high-capacity memory chips, is toform a joint venture with Minebea Co's 54%-owned NMB Semiconductor Co Ltd todo 16M-bit and up memory chips: it is capitalised at $100,000 and starts July1.andM;- o -andM;Fujitsu Ltd will double output of 1M-bit memory chips at its Gresham, Oregonplant to 1m a month by year-end from the 500,000 a month now.andM;- o -andM;And in Japan, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co will be doing 1m 4Ms a monthby year end, up from 500,000 now, Hitachi Ltd and Toshiba Corp, each alsodoing 500,000 now, plan to go to 2m each, and NEC Corp looks to do 2m fromOctober.andM;- o -andM;Seems SynOptics Communications Inc isn't the only one to have develop-edtechnology to enable Fibre Distributed Data Interface traffic to run at100Mbps over twisted pair cable (CI No 1,447): Chipcom Corp, Southborough,Massachusetts claims to have pulled just the same trick.andM;- o -andM;Intel Corp is seeing such lusty demand for the 80386 microprocessor that ithas granted a temporary reprieve to its Livermore, California 4&quot; wafer fab,due to have closed this year: the 17-year-old plant will now stay openanother year.andM;- o -andM;Sale of substantially all the assets of MiniScribe Corp to Maxtor Corp is setfor June 30, whereafter it becomes Maxtor Colorado Corp.andM;- o -andM;SUSCO Technology Procurement Inc seems to have swept up the more significantcomputer remains at Drexel Burnham, and is claiming to have $1m worth ofVAXes, printers, and terminals: it is offering the equipment for either saleor rental, and says that it expects further shipments in July; the companyhas offices in Massachusetts, Texas, and California, and its UK subsidiary,SUS Computers Ltd, is based in Walsall, West Midlands.andM;- o -andM;See any of the stories on the Seiko Epson Co Seiko Receptor wristwatch pagerin the press last week? Japanese manufacturers have a reputation for milkingtheir foreign partners for their ideas and technology and then going italone, so you wouldn't expect them to mention the Plessey Semiconductor chipsthat power the thing, but ATandamp;E Corp has reason to feel a little miffed - noneof the press we encountered made any mention of ATandamp;E, despite the fact thatthe whole thing was the San Francisco company's idea and it simplycommissioned Seiko to make the watches - and despite what Seiko says, it willbe ATandamp;E that markets the service and not Seiko.andM;- o -andM;And which company did the pioneering work on the chips that provide theautofocus mechanism in cameras? It was Honeywell Inc in what in retrospectlooks like the most successful outcome from its foray into the semiconductorbusiness - but it is tired of seeing its brainchild ripped off and reckonsits patents are being infringed: it has now asked the US International TradeCommission to ban import into the US of Minolta Camera Co autofocus camerasclaiming they infringe its patents - Honeywell says it provided Minolta, and15 other Japanese camera manufacturers, with the information for making theautofocus module on a confidential basis and on the understanding that thecompany would buy the parts from Honeywell when it put the cameras intoproduction; instead, it says, the companies copied the technology and theclosure of Honeywell's Colorado Springs chip manufacturing facility was adirect result of the orders it expected never materialising.andM;- o -andM;British Telecommunications Plc on Friday announced OSCA Voice, the latest inits Open Systems Cabling Architecture product line, at the Applied NetworkResearch-Commed Infrastructure 90 conference for building professionals: OSCAVoice is a step on the road to ISDN and complete speech-data integration;OSCA will include a wiring option for the ISDN2 service when that isintroduced - sometime next year.andM;- o -andM;Explains a lot, doesn't it? One of the revelations in Tom Watson Jr's bookFather, Son andamp; Co: My Life at IBM and Beyond is that as a kid, he once boughtsome skunk stink glands and placed them in the school ventilation system,forcing the headmaster to send everyone home - &quot;It was my moment of ultimatetriumph,&quot; declares Old Tom - and there's a vast crowd of IBM users out therethat strongly suspects that something very like skunk gland extract iscirculating in the water cooling systems of their mainframes to this veryday.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
