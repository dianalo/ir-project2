They also serve as the signposts of white politics.    &quot;Black participation becomes black rule,&quot; says an election poster nailed to a palm. &quot;Rhodesia reformed and surrendered,&quot; warns a weeping willow. &quot;Restore South Africa's greatness,&quot; is the message of a mighty oak.    These are the slogans of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, and they point to the 180-degree change in the country's political debate since the Conservatives ousted the liberal Progressive Federal Party as the official parliamentary opposition in last May's general election.    No longer do white politicians, prodded from the left, debate constitutional reform and possible post-apartheid models of government. Instead, white politics have degenerated into a bitter battle between the Conservatives and the ruling National Party for the soul of right-wing Afrikanerdom. It is a contest, in effect, to prove which party is whiter.    The Conservatives, who would like to see the country partitioned into separate &quot;homelands&quot; for the various races, claim that National Party efforts to reform apartheid will lead to black majority rule. This has prompted the government to put reform on the back burner while it uses its state-of-emergency powers to crush militant black opposition. Anti-apartheid activists say it isn't any coincidence that yesterday's government ban on political activities by major black opposition groups and individuals came just one week before important parliamentary by-elections here and in another Transvaal constituency.    &quot;The Pretoria regime is clearly petrified of the white right wing,&quot; says the Azanian People's Organization, a black liberation movement hit by the banning.    The new repressive regulations may horrify the black opposition, but they will go down well here, where old-fashioned apartheid is still the order of the day.    &quot;When you walk into a Conservative Party house, the first thing you get hit with is, 'Why are you doing everything for the blacks?'&quot; says Hennie Erasmus, the National Party candidate here. &quot;It is the Conservatives' first line of defense, and their second and third and 10th. That's all they talk about.&quot;    So that's what the National Party talks about, too. In a counterattack launched in Cape Town's parliament, a National Party member asked why, if the Conservative Party wants to shut out blacks from white South Africa, does the party's Standerton candidate, Rosier de Ville, employ a black man as a clerk in his law practice. Mr. de Ville replies in speeches by playing down the status of the black worker, saying he really isn't a full-fledged clerk.    Bemoaning this &quot;whiter than thou&quot; obsession, Johannesburg's Star newspaper says, &quot;It is a sad omen . . . when white politics descend to this rock-bottom level.&quot;    But that is where they are likely to stay. The liberal opposition, devastated by its poor performance in May, has splintered into factions, each tugging in different directions. More and more, liberals are turning their backs on formal politics.    This leaves the white political arena, where for the most part South Africa's future will be shaped, to those committed to apartheid. Thus, on Monday night, white politics will enter a new era by harkening back to an old one. Conservative and National party leaders will square off in their first-ever televised debate, but instead of addressing the issue crucial to South Africa's future -- how blacks will be brought into the central government -- they will debate the burning issue of the past half century -- how best to protect white interests.    &quot;For me as an Afrikaner, it is very important that the political debate has changed,&quot; says Mr. de Ville. &quot;For the first time since 1978, when the government started with its reform {of apartheid}, some people are fighting for the rights of whites.&quot;    This year was supposed to be a joyous one for Afrikanerdom, as it marks the 150th anniversary of the Great Trek away from British domination in the Cape. But, reflecting the split in white politics evident in Standerton, the re-enactment of the Trek in October will see Afrikaners heading in two directions. A group supportive of the National Party will take its wagon trains one way, and a second group in tune with the Conservative Party will set off in another.    This split has dashed plans for one glorious Trek replay harbored by Carel Boshoff, who talks sadly about a &quot;state of emergency in Afrikanerdom.&quot; &quot;The Afrikaners are in a crisis,&quot; says Mr. Boshoff, who is the head of an Afrikaner culture organization and the son-in-law of the late H.F. Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid. &quot;This is an important year for us.&quot;    But the unity he is seeking will prove elusive, if the campaigning in Standerton is any guide. &quot;It pains me to see the way the debate is going,&quot; says Natie Otto, taking a break in his dental office. &quot;All of our proud institutions -- our church, culture, language -- are being used by politics.&quot;    A few doors down in the National Party headquarters, Mr. Erasmus says he is hard pressed to come up with answers for voters who ask if it's true what the Conservative Party says about blacks overrunning the schools, the old-age homes, the entire country.    &quot;Their arguments are based on emotion and that the Afrikaner is the most important,&quot; he says. &quot;It's like something we've heard before: Deutschland ueber alles.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
