About 1,200 industry executives and analysts are expected at thethree-day meeting that ends Tuesday.   The passage in October of the new Clean Air Act prompted thepetroleum and auto industries to conduct a joint effort to developa new gasoline to meet the stricter standards for gasolineemissions.   Industry officials say the act has mandated a product for whichmanufacturing technology does not exist, and may not exist when thecleaner gasoline is required to be on the market.   The Clean Air Act requires a 15 percent reduction in gasemissions by 1995, and 25 percent by 2000.   Because of the new standards, other fuels - such as ethanol -may become more desirable. But low oil prices in the 1980s helpedweaken the effort to develop alternative fuels.   Raymond G. Friend, vice president of High Plains Corp. ofWichita, Kan., which produces ethanol, says ethanol's reputation asdamaging to autos is false and has been challenged in a federallawsuit against nine oil companies.   ``The anti-ethanol campaign has diminished and demand isbuilding,'' he said.   A number of oil companies, among them Amoco and Texaco, haveintroduced reformulated, less-polluting gasolines.   The crisis in the Persian Gulf has increased the relationshipbetween supply and environmental issues. The crisis has increasedoil industry interest in environmentally sensitive areas of theUnited States now closed to drilling as possible new sources ofoil. They include the outer continental shelf, federal lands in thelower 48 states and the Arctic Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.   But Charles J. DiBona, president of the petroleum institute,acknowledges that a lack of public trust stemming from the ExxonValdez oil spill in March 1989 reduces oil industry options.   ``There is not a lot of recognition that we ought to address thequestion of access to public lands (for oil exploration),'' DiBonasaid recently. ``This (Persian Gulf) crisis has not caused peopleto reassess opening the arctic refuge or offshore drilling.''   DiBona says domestic exploration is an answer to U.S. dependenceon foreign oil supplies. The number of drilling rigs in the UnitedStates has increased to 1,100 from about 900 since Iraq invadedKuwait on Aug. 2.   But new drilling will be fighting the recent downward trend inU.S. oil production from 3.7 billion gallons in 1985 to 3.3 billiongallons in 1989.   ``There is a real need to rethink the domestic explorationstrategy,'' said James M. Patterson, professor of marketing atIndiana University in Bloomington. ``About 80 percent of the holesever drilled are in the lower 48 states, so there are probably nogreat surprises here.''   Patterson says oil companies must pursue oil in other areasoutside the Middle East if exploration is not allowed in the arcticrefuges. He said Mexico, despite its long history of opposition toU.S. participation in its oil industry, may be willing to change.   Venezuela, Canada, Romania and the Soviet Union may also presentopportunities, Patterson said.   DiBona said the institute faces several legislative issuesincluding its continuing effort to open the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge to Drilling.   He said the industry is concerned about congressionalconsideration of a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act thatwould regulate underground reinjection and storage and state-levelattempts to prevent large petroleum companies from operating theirown gasoline stations.</TEXT></DOC>
