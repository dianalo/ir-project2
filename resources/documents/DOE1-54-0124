Small decrements in lung functionhave been reported following 2-h exposures to 0.12 ppm O{sub 3}. Forshort exposures to higher O{sub 3} concentrations, lung function decrementsare a function of exposure duration. Thus, we investigated the hypothesisthat prolonged exposure to 0.12 ppm O{sub 3} would result in progressivelylarger changes in respiratory function and symptoms over time. Ten nonsmokingmales were exposed once to clean air and once to 0.12 ppm O{sub 3} for6.6 h. Exposures consisted of six 50-min exercise periods, each followedby 10-min rest and measurement; a 35-min lunch period followed by thethird exercise period. Exercise ventilation averaged approximately 40L/min. Forced expiratory and inspiratory spirometry and respiratory symptomswere measured prior to exposure and after each exercise. Airway reactivityto methacholine was determined after each exposure. After correctingfor the air exposures, FEV 1.0 was found to decrease linearly duringthe O{sub 3} exposure and was decreased by an average of 13.0 percentat the end of exposure. Decreases in FVC and FEF24-75% were also linearand averaged 8.3 and 17.4 percent, respectively, at the end of exposure.On forced inspiratory tests, the FIVC and FIV05 were decreased 12.6 and20.7 percent, respectively. Increases in the symptom ratings of coughand pain on deep inspiration were observed with O{sub 3} exposure butnot with clean air. Airway reactivity to methacholine was approximatelydoubled following O{sub 3} exposure.</TEXT></DOC>
