Imperial Tobacco Ltd. and RJR Macdonald Inc. filed motions in Quebec's Superior Court, each claiming the law violates freedom of speech guarantees in the constitution and is outside the federal government's jurisdiction.    Imperial, a unit of Imasco Ltd., which is based here, is Canada's largest tobacco company, with about 55% of the Canadian market. RJR Macdonald, a unit of RJR Nabisco Inc., Atlanta, is the third largest, with about a 17% market share.    With yesterday's actions, all three of Canada's tobacco companies have challenged in court the legislation banning all tobacco advertising and curtailing tobacco-company sponsorship of cultural and athletic events. Rothmans, Benson andamp; Hedges Inc., ranked No. 2 and indirectly controlled by Philip Morris Inc., New York, filed a federal court action in Toronto in July.    Both RJR Macdonald and Rothmans have said the law would help entrench Imperial as the No. 1 tobacco company. But an Imasco spokesman said, &quot;We feel as threatened as they do by the act,&quot; which, he said, gives &quot;a monopoly on advertising to our American competitors.&quot;    The law bans tobacco advertising in magazines published in Canada, but doesn't restrict advertising in U.S. magazines distributed in Canada that account for about two-thirds of Canadian magazine sales. U.S. cigarette brands currently hold a 1% market share in Canada. The law, passed by parliament this summer, was supported by all three political parties. </TEXT></DOC>
