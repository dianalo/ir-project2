Insider trading is legal in New Zealand.    That doesn't make it respectable.    &quot;It's deplorable,&quot; says Colin I. Patterson, chairman of New Zealand's Securities Commission, who is heading an inquiry into the practice. &quot;If you want small investors in the business, you've got to make sure they get a fair deal.&quot;    But that can be tough for the Securities Commission, with an annual budget equivalent to about $289,000 and a staff of six, including two typists.    In New Zealand, with its population of three million, everything about the securities business is small-scale -- except the amount of money to be made. Compared with its bustling New York counterpart, Wellington's stock exchange resembles a classroom. A few brokers sit sedately at rows of desks, staring at a blackboard on which &quot;chalkies&quot; scribble trades.    Frantic trading over the past year and a half has kept the chalkies hopping. A bull run in the 12 months to last November pushed the Barclays Industrial Index (the New Zealand equivalent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average) up more than 90%. Since then, it has skidded almost 30%. In the frenzy, securities-industry officials say, questionable trading practices have boomed as well.    While there are some rules governing securities trading -- company directors, for instance, aren't allowed to profit personally from a position of trust -- determined offenders find ways around them.    &quot;Directors' wives are a class that has given us a bit of amusement,&quot; says the Securities Commission's Mr. Patterson, noting the propensity of spouses to pop up in the share registers of their husbands' companies just in time for a propitious announcement.    &quot;Insider trading is considered a way of life here, more or less,&quot; says Steve M. Spelman, manager of Ascorp and founder of the Society for the Promotion of Insider Trading, or SPIT. &quot;The problem was that it used to be just for the elite few.&quot;    The 26-year-old Mr. Spelman, who refers to U.S. insider-trading figure Ivan Boesky as &quot;my idol, Ivan,&quot; last year decided to create Insider Trading Hotline, a service to get inside information to the public. Subscribers pay almost $200 a year to be phoned by Mr. Spelman's company whenever a hot tip comes through.    To get the information, Mr. Spelman offers informers a payment tied to the gain in the relevant company's stock. He even places newspaper advertisements setting out his fee scale: from $580, for information on a stock that rises 20% in the two months after purchase, to $57,900 if the stock should rise as much as 2,000%.    Mr. Spelman is so keen to promote insider trading that he offered a reporter a stock tip. When told that for ethical reasons, the reporter didn't trade shares, Mr. Spelman was incredulous. &quot;How do you make a living?&quot; he asked.    Mr. Spelman's antics have proved a bit much even for New Zealand's low-key regulators. Earlier this year, the Securities Commission called him in for a chat.    The commission appeared less interested in Mr. Spelman than in his claim that one of his informants was a company director, who could have been in breach of the law against profiting from a position of trust. When Mr. Spelman declined to identify any of his informants, he was hauled into court and fined $1,600 for refusing to answer the commission's questions.    Mr. Spelman says the publicity surrounding that case increased his subscriptions fourfold. The commission's Mr. Patterson concedes that the penalty was &quot;pretty derisory, actually,&quot; and unlikely to prove much of a deterrent. The commission will continue to probe instances of questionable share dealing, he says, but he isn't &quot;a strong supporter&quot; of introducing a criminal law against insider trading.    New Zealand's four stock exchanges grew out of a gold rush late last century. Because the country's business community is small and, until recently, was fairly insular, a clubby atmosphere developed, in which a handshake was usually as good as a contract and reputation carried more weight than regulation. &quot;I know most of the directors of the major companies personally, and the general run of them would never dream of taking personal profit from information about their companies,&quot; says Mr. Patterson.    But some members of the investment community say changing times demand a more cynical view. &quot;At one time, if you heard someone say that a street kid had beaten up an elderly woman, you'd think they must be talking about New York,&quot; says Paul Drummond, a portfolio manager at Westpac Investment Management NZ Ltd. &quot;But now that sort of thing has started trickling down to this part of the world, and I suppose it's the same with insider trading.&quot;    Just as New Zealanders are learning to lock their doors, Mr. Drummond reasons, they might also have to accept stricter controls in the share market. &quot;The dollars are getting bigger,&quot; he says. &quot;A deal that would have made you 5,000 {New Zealand} dollars or 10,000 dollars at one time will make you $5 million or $10 million today if you have the right sort of information.&quot; (The New Zealand dollar is currently valued at 58 U.S. cents.)    &quot;A lot of immoral behavior goes on here,&quot; says Robert Jones, chief executive officer of the large New Zealand property concern Robert Jones Investments Ltd.    Earlier this year, Mr. Jones says, he held a briefing on the company for analysts from several brokerages. &quot;There was a great deal of buying activity before those fellows published their reports,&quot; he says. The company's share price surged when several favorable reports were released, he says, &quot;and then we noticed {the brokers} were all sellers.&quot;    Although the New Zealand government has warned it might enact laws against insider trading, most securities-industry experts doubt that such legislation would have any effect. &quot;A government can make rules,&quot; says Lawrence Dott, Wellington manager of the brokerage Satterthwaite andamp; Co. &quot;But someone will always find a way to break them.&quot;    If such laws were passed, says Mr. Spelman, he'd just change the name of his service from Insider Trading Hotline to Best Buy Hotline. &quot;There are always loopholes in new laws,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm sure we'd find enough gray areas to keep us going for a year at least.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
