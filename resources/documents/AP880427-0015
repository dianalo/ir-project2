Basic wage rates over the past 12 months have risen 2.6 percentfor union workers and 3.5 percent for non-union employees, theBureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday.   But when benefits are included, the overall hourly cost of laborin private industry increases at 3.9 percent for union members and4 percent for non-union members.   ``Some of these benefits have turned into entitlements, and justlike the government, a lot of businesses have lost control ofthem,'' said Richard Belous, a labor economist for The ConferenceBoard, a business research house.   Benefit increases in the 12 months ending April 1 have average5.8 percent overall in private industry, double the 2.9 percentincrease of the previous 12 months, said the Labor Departmentstatisticians.   And among blue-collar workers, benefit cost increases havenearly tripled _ from a 2.3 percent gain a year ago to 6.8 percentthe past 12 months. In manufacturing, non-cash worker benefits rose7 percent in the past year, compared with just 1.5 percent a yearearlier.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that employee fringebenefits such as pension and health and dental insurance plans nowcomprise an average 40 percent of a company's labor costs.   The government said Tuesday that the bulk of the increase inthose costs in the past year was escalating health insurancepremiums, with a smaller portion coming from increased SocialSecurity contributions by employers.   ``For a while, it looked like many employers were containinghealth care costs,'' said Belous. ``But in the last year a lot ofthe solutions have unraveled. With mandatory health insurance onthe horizon, a lot of companies are going to have to go back to thedrawing board.''   John Zalusky, an economist for the AFL-CIO, said the stockmarket crash last October explains much of the difference in thesize of benefit increases between union and non-union workers.   ``Union employers tend to have defined benefit pension plans,which means that when the market crashed, they had to put moremoney into the kitty,'' he said. ``Non-union employers haveswitched more to defined contribution plans in which thebeneficiaries absorbed the brunt of the crash.''   However, Zalusky acknowledged that unions also are being sentsignals from their members to get more benefits and job securityrather than cash at the bargaining table despite nominally lowertax rates.   Just last month, officials of the Teamsters union were told by180,000 members to take back a contract just negotiated with thetrucking industry and swap some of the pay increase for biggeremployer contributions to health and pension plans.   Many of those benefits, such as training programs and profitsharing, bonus and employee stock ownership plans don't show upfully in the government's collective bargaining and employment costfigures, Zalusky said.   ``The worker retraining programs negotiated with Ford, GeneralMotors and ATandamp;T now constitute the largest privately endowededucation program in the country,'' he said, ``and they are nowherereflected in the data.''   In a separate report, the Labor Department said first-year payincreases in major union contracts negotiated in the first threemonths of 1988 averaged only 2.1 percent, excluding cost-of-livingadjustments (COLA) and lump-sum bonuses.   However, excluding the 20 percent who agreed to wage freezes _often in exchange for profit-sharing, stock ownership or bonusarrangements _ the average increase under the new contracts was 2.7percent, the department said.   Including the COLA payments and lump-sum or profit-sharingbonuses from other, older contracts, the average effective wageincrease over the past 12 months under collective bargainingagreements has been 3.8 percent, the government said.   That compares favorably with both the 2.4 percent effective wageincrease a year earlier for union members and the 3.5 percent gainthe past 12 months for non-union workers.   Earlier government data showed that union workers last yearmaintained a roughly 36 percent wage advantage over non-unionworkers _ $465 a week vs. $342 in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
