Almost every Soviet citizen depends onhis work place for an apartment and for access to vacationpackages or even food. In a company town, however, theworkplace assumes gigantic proportions, easily supplantingthe local organs of government authority and constituting acommunist tyranny of its own.   In &quot;Steeltown, USSR: Soviet Society in the Gorbachev Era&quot;(University of California Press, 269 pages, $24.95), StephenKotkin describes Magnitogorsk, a company town that reflectsboth the rise and the decline of the Soviet Union. Founded in1929 and modeled after the U.S. Steel complex in Gary, Ind.,the Magnitogorsk works quickly became a symbol of the Sovietdetermination to create a &quot;new industry&quot; and a &quot;new man.&quot; Itproduced half the steel for Soviet tanks during World War II,and today it turns out more steel each year than Canada andCzechoslovakia combined.</LP><TEXT>   Until recently, Magnitogorsk was a closed city. Mr.Kotkin, a history professor at Princeton, was the firstAmerican to visit Magnitogorsk in 45 years, and although heonly spent four months there -- two months in 1987 and twomonths in 1989 -- he circulated widely, making friends fromall walks of life. This allowed him to feel the pulse of thecity, its &quot;warlike&quot; character, as people struggled toguarantee their families a basic quality of life, and also toexperience the colossal inertia of a region tied to anobsolescent industrial base. The heart of Magnitogorsk is itssteel plant, and that plant, he concludes, is a &quot;wheezingdinosaur&quot; waiting to be destroyed.   Mr. Kotkin interviewed party officials and factorydirectors. He spoke before students, rode the packedstreetcars and breathed the polluted air. He clearly likedthe people, but the atmosphere of the city that he conveys isone of fatalistic helplessness. Glasnost, he writes, hasgiven the people of Magnitogorsk a clearer picture of theworld, but this has only demoralized them and deepened theirapathy.   When coal miners' strikes broke out in the Kuzbass regionin 1989, Mr. Kotkin at first expected the steel workers ofMagnitogorsk to take action themselves, given &quot;the palpableatmosphere of social tension and the sheer number ofworkers.&quot; Instead, workers in the Magnitogorsk steel millsstayed on the job, satisfied that the factory provided themwith scarce goods and fearing retaliation from bosses who hadsplit the working class into privileged and unprivilegedworkers and had control over every aspect of their lives.When elections took place in Magnitogorsk, the workers alsoshowed little inclination to fight to change the framework oftheir lives. Instead, they supported candidates who,occupying high posts, might fare better in the fight with theexisting bureaucracy for access to privileges and goods.(Even if democrats had triumphed in the elections, however,they would have been helpless, since almost all funds arecontrolled by the real rulers of the localities, the Moscowministries.)   Mr. Kotkin's intention is obviously to give a portrait ofa typical Soviet industrial area under Mikhail Gorbachev, buthis study is too episodic to convey the surrealisticcharacter of Soviet life. What he does do is provide anexcellent portrait of what central planning means to thepopulation of a Soviet city.   Central planning makes it possible to ignore any humandesires or needs, and Mr. Kotkin saw the effects of thesystem first hand. An operation he was to observe in a cityhospital was canceled because of a lack of water. Whenrationing was introduced, rumors spread that the soap quota-- 200 grams per person every three months -- was less thanthe ration in Leningrad at the nadir of the blockade.   Although the Magnitogorsk plant is the world's largeststeel producer, the city's citizens wait 15 years for aseparate apartment, breathe air containing a level ofpollutants 33 times higher than that considered dangerous inthe U.S. and, in the case of men, die on average only threeyears after going on pension at the age of 60.   Nonetheless, Mr. Kotkin shows that central planning hascreated its own demand. By cutting off initiative andconcentrating on quantity over quality, it has contributed tothe steel industry's obsolescence, meaning that marketreforms -- which would introduce international competition --must be avoided for the Magnitogorsk works to survive. When aJapanese visitor was asked by a steel worker how far behindMagnitogorsk was, he said, &quot;forever, you are behind usforever.&quot;   Mr. Kotkin's book is, in many respects, a sobering lessonabout the possible limits of reform in a country that needs arevolution in habits and expectations.   &quot;How much evil has accumulated]&quot; said a middle-agedskilled worker to Mr. Kotkin, effectively summing up themessage of the book. &quot;It hurts to think about it . . . Atfirst, there was hope. We felt we could breathe at last . . .Now I don't know. I'm tired, even though I'm not old. Andanyway, how can you live only on faith? We're boxed in.&quot;   ---   Mr. Satter, a Hooper Fellow at the Foreign PolicyInstitute in Philadelphia, covers the Soviet Union forReader's Digest.</TEXT></DOC>
