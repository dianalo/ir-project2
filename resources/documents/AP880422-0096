While the Kuwaitis celebrated Thursday, Western diplomaticsources said the nine pro-Iranian hijackers, who were given safepassage out of Algeria had reached Beirut.   The two other freed hostages, Saudi Arabian citizens, were flownhome in a private executive jet.   Today's editions of The New York Times quoted unidentified Arabofficials as saying the hijackers, who had killed two Kuwaitihostages, were flown on a private Algerian jet to Damascus, Syria,and then were believed to have traveled by land to Beirut.   The officials also were quoted as saying that, with theexception of one Iranian, most of the hijackers were thought to beLebanese citizens.   Western intelligence sources have said that the nine arebelieved to be members of Hezbollah, or Party of God, thepro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremist group based in Lebanon's BekaaValley.   A PLO mediator in the hijacking was quoted by a Rome newspapertoday as saying the gunmen originally planned to land in Lebanon,blow up the plane and keep the passengers hostage in Beirut. Syriantroops, who control the airport, refused to let the plane land.   As they arrived in Kuwait Thursday night, women threw roses andconfetti at the 22 passengers and seven crew members who had beenprisoners in the seized Kuwait Airways Boeing 747.   Several said they were certain Iran was a party to the hijacking.   The emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber Ahmed Sabah, and Crown PrinceSheik Saad Abdullah Sabah led the group of government officials andrelatives that met the freed captives at the Kuwait airport. Thehostages included three cousins of the emir.   Kuwaitis at the airport celebrated their leaders' resolve in notbowing to the hijackers' demand that Kuwait release 17 pro-Iranianterrorists jailed for bombing the U.S. and French embassies inKuwait in 1983.   Flocks of doves soared over the airport after the Kuwait AirwaysBoeing 707 touched down, completing a six-hour flight from Algiers,where the ordeal ended early Wednesday.   Bedouin men danced and clapped at the Kuwaiti airport, andchildren waved flags and sang, ``God bless our father, Jaber,''referring to the emir.   The freed hostages traveled by motorcade to the city centeralong a route lined by thousands of people. Hundreds followed incars and limousines, honking their horns and singing, ``Wesacrifice blood and souls for you, O Kuwait.''   The hijackers, who dumped the bodies of two Kuwaiti security menfrom the seized plane while it was on the ground in Larnaca,Cyprus, apparently agreed to free the remaining hostages in returnfor safe passage.   Algeria, which mediated, has refused to discuss the deal.Algerian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said thehijackers slipped out of the plane shortly before the hostages werelet out.   Some of the freed Kuwaitis said one hijacker was replaced by twoothers when the plane landed in Mashhad, Iran, April 5, the day itwas seized on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight with 122 aboard.   ``One of the two was obviously a military pilot. He was orderingother gunmen around and telling them lots of things about theaircraft and supervising the wiring of explosives to most parts ofthe plane,'' said passenger Khaled Nasser Zaferi.   The claims corroborated accounts of hostages freed earlier inthe ordeal, some of whom said additional weapons and explosiveswere brought aboard in Mashhad, where the plane spent three days.   The Times quoted the Arab sources as saying the plane wassupplied at Mashhad with communications gear that allowed it tostay in touch with outside parties that were issuing instructions,at least at Larnaca.   Malaz Abdo, deputy director of the Palestine LiberationOrganization office in Cyprus, said the hijackers' plan to land inBeirut was foiled when President Hafez Assad of Syria refused tolet the plane land, Rome's Paese Sera newspaper reported today.Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon.   Abdo acted as a mediator in negotiations with the hijackers inLarnaca, the plane's second stop.   The hijackers released 57 hostages in Mashhad and 13 at Larnacain exchange for the fuel that took them to their third stop,Algiers, where an elderly diabetic was released last week.   Kuwait and other Arab countries praised Algeria for achievingfreedom for the hostages without additional violence. But theUnited States, Britain and other Western powers criticized Algeriafor allowing the hijackers to get away.   A Soviet-built Antonov transport of the Algerian air force wasseen taking off from the Algiers airport before dawn Wednesday,shortly before the hostages left the hijacked plane. It was widelyassumed the hijackers were aboard.</TEXT></DOC>
