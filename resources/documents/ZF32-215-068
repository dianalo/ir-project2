(usingMicrosoft Windows 3.0 and WordPerfect) (tutorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Carter, Stephen R.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>A basic tutorial on Microsoft Windows 3.0 and the use of variousWordPerfect packages with Windows 3.0 is presented.andP;  The Windows3.0 graphical user interface provides an environment that allowsmultiple programs to run at the same time.andP;  Although aWindows-specific version of WordPerfect has yet to be released,all WordPerfect products except Repeat Performance will run withWindows 3.0.andP;  A basic microcomputer (Intel 8088/8086-based) willrun multiple WordPerfect programs at the same time with Windows,but only the one on screen will be executing; the others are movedout of memory onto disk.andP;  WordPerfect with Windows really shineson the 80386/80486-based machines.andP;  WordPerfect 5.1 can run in awindow, as can WordPerfect Office Shell.andP;  Using Shell reducesresource usage to a single additional virtual machine to the oneWindows is running in; this allows all DOS applications to be runfrom this window.andP;  Windows makes it possible to switch from oneprogram to another without exiting the first; the programs areunaware of each other.andP;  Areas suggested for further investigationinclude the use of Program Information Files (PIFs) and theWIN.INI file.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Microsoft Corp.

You have another DOS machine running.andM;Now press  (Ctrl-Esc) and view the Task List (Screen 2).andP;  To return to theProgram Manager, double-click on the Program Manager entry or use the arrowkeys to select it, and press (Enter).andM;You're now back to your first virtual machine.andP;  The second is still alive andwell.andP;  Another way to switch is to press (Alt-Tab).andP;  Do this and you'll beswitched immediately to your second (the DOS) virtual machine.andP;  Do it again,and back you go to the Program Manager.andM;Now let's start a few more virtual machines.andP;  First, WordPerfect.andP;  Press(Alt-Tab) until you return to your Pro -  Manager screen.andP;  Click on the Filemenu option (or press (Alt-F), click on Run (or press R), then typec:\wp51\wp.exe and press (Enter).andP;  WordPerfect is now another virtualmachine.andM;Note that this will work even though you may not have enough &quot;real&quot; memoryfor Windows, DOS and WordPerfectandM;If you run out of real memory, Windows uses your hard disk as  virtual&quot;memory.andP;  This is a temporary swap area that acts like RAM.andM;Now press  (Ctrl-Esc) to view the Task List again.andP;  Notice the new WP entryin the Task List.andM;Double-click on Program Manager and, using your newfound knowledge (you know,the (Alt-F, R, program name stuff), start DrawPerfect PlanPerfect or anyother DOS program.andP;  Again, these procedures will work for any processor(8088/8086, 80286, 80386, 80486).andM;The only difference is that the 80386 and 80486 can execute these virtualmachines simultaneously and can &quot;window&quot; DOS programs.andP;  WordPerfect in awindow? You bet !andP;  As we anxiously await the release of a true Windowsversion of WordPerfect, the question arises: Can I run WordPerfect 5.1 in awindow? Yes, you can.andM;In fact, I wrote this article using WordPerfect in a window.andP;  Use  (CtrlEsc)to display the Task list, select WordPerfect and press (Enter).andP;  WithWordPerfect on your screen, press (Alt-Enter).andP;  Presto! WordPerfect runningin a window.andM;You can move, size or minimize the window, just like any other controlled byWindows.andP;  Press  (Alt-Enter) again, the window disappears and you're back toWordPerfect in full-screen mode.andP;  Shell, the Windows memory saverandM;The preceding example created four virtual machines: Windows, DOS,WordPerfect and DrawPerfect.andP;  Because of the way they were started, eachvirtual machine requires 640K.andP;  So, 4 x 640K andequals; 2,560K-that's over 2megabytes.andM;Using Shell reduces your resource usage to a single virtual machine besidesthe one Windows is running in).andP;  You can then run each of your DOSapplications from this window.andP;  Close all of the virtual machines you'vecreated thus far.andM;To do so, press  (Ctrl-Esc) to bring up the Task List.andP;  Select WordPerfectand press (Enter).andP;  With WP active, press Exit  F7), (N) No, (N) No to exitthe program normally.andP;  Press  (CtrlEsc) again and repeat this process foreach of the other virtual machines you have running, except the ProgramManager and COMMAND.COM.andP;  In each case, use the keystrokes you normally useto exit the program.andM;When all of the other machines have been closed, switch to COMMAND.COM.andP;  Atthe DOS prompt, type c:\office\shell.exe and press (Enter).andM;WordPerfect Office Shell is now running as a virtual machine.andP;  Yes, the(Alt-Enter) window-making trick works here, too.andP;  Now you're using only 2 x640K, or 1,280K of memory.andM;Not only are you using half the memory, but all of the WordPerfect OfficeShell macros are available.andP;  One possible drawback to this method is thatmultiple programs run from the Shell menu, using its hot-keys, will notoperate simultaneously.andM;Since Shell does not support multitasking, each program is swapped to diskwhen a new program is run.andM;A note to you techies: Windows acts as an expanded memory manager when extraextended memory is available.andP;  Therefore, Shell win use expanded memory justas it does when running under DOS.andM;What have you learned about Windows so far?andM;* It can run multiple DOS programs, including WordPerfect, PlanPerfect, Shelland others, in a window.andM;* You can switch from one program to another without exiting the first.andP;  On80386 or 80486 machines, each program will continue to execute in thebackground.andM;* Each program running under Windows is unaware that it is sharing the PCwith other programs.andP;  Tips for advanced studyandM;Windows provides many tools for advanced control of each virtual machine.andP;  Ituses Program Information Files  (PIF) to find out how to work with each one.andO;Refer to the chapter on PIF definition in your Windows manual to learn how tospecify memory requirements (base,  extended and expanded).andM;Look into the way a PIF allows the assignment of a &quot;hot key.&quot; The hot keyallows you to instantly switch to a given virtual machine without using(CtrlEsc) or  (Alt-Tab).andM;For example, you might use  (Ctrl-S) to switch to Shell.andP;  WPCorp ships PIFdefinitions with each of its products.andP;  You may use these as they are ormodify them as needed.andM;Also look into the section on the WIN.INI file for instructions onautomatically starting virtual machines each time you run Windows.andM;The world of PC computing is maturing rapidly.andP;  Keep your eyes open and bewilling to take a few chances with new ways to use your PC.andM;Many of them will pay off-and you'll see others scrambling to get out of yourway as you zoom productively by.andM;Stephen Carter is a group leader for PC Development at WPCorp.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
