The six- to eight-week suspension of the research at theLouisiana State University Medical Center had nothing to do withprotests, said Dr. Perry Rigby, chancellor of the medical center.   ``The value of doing the research is not in question'' Perrysaid. ``Questions have been raised, however, some of which pertainto the technical aspects of the research, and some of which pertainto the granting agency.''   The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, isinvestigating the project at the request of Rep. Bob Livingston,R-La., and its report is expected in December at the earliest,Perry said.   A panel of LSU scientists will conduct an internal review of theresearch in order to respond to the GAO findings, said Dr. RobertDaniels, dean of the School of Medicine at LSU-New Orleans.   In the experiment, a cat is anesthetized, part of the front ofits skull is removed and it is locked into a vise. A helium-poweredgun then fires a small steel sphere into the cat's brain from 31inches away.   The object is to determine the best treatment for brain-woundedsoldiers, project director Dr. Michael Carey has said previously.Cary wasn't at the news conference called Friday to announce thesuspension.   Describing his findings in May, Cary said the experiment hasshown that a bullet wound to the brain stops respiration but, ifrespiration is supported artificially, the animal will beginbreathing again on its own.   Animal rights groups across the nation have called for a stop tothe research, paid for by the Army.   The Physicians Comittee for Responsible Medicine has askedDefense Secretary Richard Cheney to stop the project, claiming itis superfluous.   The project has brought an estimated $2 million to LSU MedicalCenter over the past six years, Rigby and Daniels said. Theyestimated that 700 cats had been subjected to the experiments, butneither would discuss medical conclusions.</TEXT></DOC>
