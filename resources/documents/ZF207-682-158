 Electronic data interchange (EDI)will make much of our paperwork obsolete.andP;  By applying industry EDIstandards, agencies can save millions and transform a large portion of thefederal work force.andM;Agency offices have file cabinets of time and attendance sheets, purchaseorders, requisitions, receiving reports and other forms.andP;  Our hands aresmudged with carbon and our eyesight is strained from reading the seventhcopy of a seven-part form.andM;Most of us wonder why somebody isn't doing something about all this paper.andO;Somebody is, but it will take many more of us before we see significantprogress.andP;  EDI project leader Roy Saltman and his NIST colleagues could useour support as they carry the torch for EDI in the govrnment.andM;EDI is not a new concept.andP;  Data file exchanges are as old as computingitself.andP;  The problem was the lack of standards; everybody had their ownformats that they wanted everybody else to use.andP;  It was like a railroadsystem where every train ran on a different guage of track.andM;In 1979 the American National Standards Institute chartered the AccreditedStandards Committee on Electronic Data Interchange, also known as the X12committee.andP;  Now business and government have a common format fortransactions.andP;  Instead of using a different format for each trading partner,you can buy an inexpensive software package for your personal computer thatwill put your orders, remittances and invoices into X12 formant fortransmission to your vendor.andM;With the cost of hardware continuing to drop, revenue-hungry time hsaringcompanies have become value-added network providers by offering niftyservices like collecting these EDI transactions from all around the world.andO;instead of dealing with thousands of short calls fighting for limitedtelecommunications ports, EDI users can download their transactions at nightwhen the rates are low.andM;Really clever agencies and companies use X12 for internal transactions,making it the standard for data transfers among accounting, inventory,purchasing and production.andP;  Imagine the embarrassment of getting thousands ofX12 transactions a day, only to covert them into incompatible formats thattare less flexible and infomative.andP;  If your software designers use X12, thesesystems know what to expect without having to convert data.andM;For example, a remittance may be returned with an explanation of why an ordercan't be filled and suggesting alternatives for the customer.andP;  Thecontracting officer may live with a delay of a couple of days but finds aweek unacceptable.andM;Timesaving ActionandM;If time is short, direct shipment from the original manufacturer can be theanswer.andP;  With just a few changes to the original information about thetransaction, the supplier's marketing system can notify the inventory andaccounting systems accordingly.andM;In addition to reducing paperwork, EDI X12 promises fewer transcriptionerrors because data need not be rekeyed.andP;  Acquisitions will be expedited bythe use of high-speed communications networks.andP;  Streamlined EDI-basedordering reduces inventories by ensuring on-time delivery.andM;Employee efficiency and morable should improve because computers will handlethe routine drudgery of paper.andP;  The composition of the federal work forcewill change, with jobs requiring advanced skills replacing those calling forclerical skills only.andM;One of the drawbacks of X12 is the start up cost.andP;  Few agencies' customizedsystems employ X12.andP;  Although commercial EDI software packages are available,most need some tailoring to fit federal systems.andM;Also, certain documents, such as contracts, grants and purchaseauthorizations, are needed in hard copy.andM;Another problem is that EDI requires more accuracy than the manual systemsbeing replaced.andP;  Automated systems can magnify errors tolerated by the oldmethods.andP;  Agency lawyers also are concerned about controlling access to EDIsystems.andM;When redesigning their software, agencies will have to find the vision todevelop or acquire X12 interfaces even when few trading partners appear to beinterested.andP;  But the pressure from industry is growing, and many agencies areresponding to potential savings that can quickly pay for the costs ofrewriting their software.andM;Walter R. Houser is responsible for information resources management andpolicy at a major federal agency.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
