The proposed amendments will require thatappellants seek reconsideration of the new ground of rejection prior toappeal or commencement of a civil action.Experience under the current rules relating to judicial review of finalboard decisions indicates that the rules may be confusing in certain respectsrelating to the time in which judicial review must be sought and the mannerin which extensions of time for seeking judicial review may be obtained.The proposed rules eliminate any confusion as to when judicial review mustbe sought and standardize the manner of obtaining extensions of time toseek judicial review.The proposed rules also make clarifying and housekeeping amendments withrespect to practice before the BPAI.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before May 24, 1989.

The statement then constitutesa new rejection of the claims. The rules, as presently written, permitappellants to treat the decision as a final decision in the case and thusimmediately appealable. 37 CFR 1.196(b)(3). Therefore, when an appellantproceeds under this option, arguments against the new rejection are presentedfor the first time to the reviewing court.A recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuitrejected the Commissioner's argument that an appeallant should not be permittedto contest the BPAI's new ground for rejection because it had not requestedreconsideration of that ground by the BPAI. In re Evanega, 829 F.2d 1110,1113, 4 USPQ 2d 1249, 1252 (Fed. Circ. 1987). See also In re Nielson, 816F.2d 1567, 1570, 2 USPQ 2d 1525, 1527 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In Evanega, theCommissioner urged that requiring appellants to request reconsideration,where the BPAI adopts a new ground for rejection, would provide the BPAIwith an opportunity to consider appellant's arguments and correct any errorswhile the case was still in the PTO. This conserves judicial resources,and in any event, obtains the benefit of the BPAI's view should judicialreview ultimately be sought. The court held, however, that in view of PTOregulations (37 CFR 1.196(b)(3)) which ``expressly provide that the board'sdecision, even if based on a new ground, is a final determination and thusmay be appealed without seeking reconsideration,'' appellant could notbe required to request reconsideration by the BPAI. <T3>Id.</T3>The rule changes proposed herein would eliminate 37 CFR 1.196(b)(3). Byremoving andSection;1.196(b)(3), appellants will no longer have the optionof treating a new ground of rejection as final and immediately appealable.Appellants' options will be limited to requesting remand to the examineror requesting reconsideration by the BPAI as set forth in andSection;andSection;1.196(b)(1)and 1.196(b)(2). It is also proposed that the preamble of andSection;1.196(b)be amended to specificially recite that a new ground of rejection shallnot be considered a final decision for judicial review.Under the proposed rules, appellants will still be able to elect furtherprosecution before the examiner under 37 CFR 1.196(b)(1) or request reconsiderationunder andSection;1.196(b)(2). Where the option of andSection;1.196(b)(2) ischosen, the proposed rule requires a request for reconsideration to addressthe new ground of rejection and state the reasons why the new ground wasin error. The proposed amendments to andSection;1.196(b)(2) also providethat the BPAI will reconsider the new rejection and, if necessary, rendera new decision. The decision on reconsideration will be deemed to incorporatethe earlier decision except for any portions of the earlier decision specificallywithdrawn.Reconsideration or remand need not be requested if appellant does not contestthe new ground. Appellants may seek judicial review as to claims not subjectto the new ground.The PTO also proposes to amend andSection;1.196(a) to expressly provide forremands to the examiner for further consideration. The BPAI has inherentauthority, as part of its role in reviewing standards of patentabilityapplied in the PTO, to remand applications to the examiner for furtherconsideration. <T3>Cf. </T3>Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) sections 1211and 1212. The proposed change merely makes express that which is inherent.The proposed amendments will also delete the portion of current andSection;1.196(d)which provides (1) that any decision which includes a remand shall notbe a final decision for the purposes of judicial review and (2) that uponconclusion of the proceedings on remand the BPAI may enter an order makingits decision final. Those provisions have been included as new andSection;1.196(e).Under this proposed paragraph, decisions pursuant to andSection;1.196(b)would not be final as to the claims subject to a new rejection.In light of the proposed addition of andSection;1.196(e), it is proposedto delete the last sentence of andSection;1.196(b)(1) which similarly providesthat the BPAI, after conclusion of proceedings on remand, may enter anorder making its decision final.<ITAG tagnum="84">(2) Requests for Reconsideration of BPAI and TTAB Decisions</ITAG>The PTO proposes to amend andSection;1.197(b) to provide that any requestfor reconsideration must specifically state the points believed to havebeen misapprehended or overlooked in the BPAI's decision. Experience hasshown that many requests for reconsideration are nothing more than reargumentof appellant's position on appeal. The provision, as proposed, intendsto limit requests to the points of law or fact which appellant feels wereoverlooked or misapprehended by the BPAI.The proposed amendments also clarify the exception found in the first sentenceof andSection;1.197(b) by including specific references to the ``originaldecision'' and the `'decision on reconsideration.'' Some confusion hasbeen noted with respect to the meaning of the current language.In order to simplify calculation of times for requesting reconsiderationof the decisions of the boards, the proposed rules would amend andSection;andSection;1.658(b),2.129(c), and 2.144 to specify a period of one month rather than the periodsexpressed in days. Section 1.197(a) currently specifies a one-month period.<ITAG tagnum="85">(3) Extensions of Time After a Decision by the BPAI To Take ActionUnder </ITAG>andSection;andSection;1.196 and 1.197Currently, appellants in patent cases may use fee extensions under andSection;1.136(a)to extend the time for making an election under andSection;1.196(b) or seekingreconsideration under andSection;1.197. Appellants may submit their requestfor reconsideration up to five months or a response to a new ground ofrejection up to six months after the date of the decision. This inordinatelydelays final disposition of appeals. The PTO proposes to amend andSection;1.136(a)to provide the fee extensions are not available to file responses to aBPAI decision pursuant to andSection;andSection;1.196, 1.197 or 1.304. Onemonth is deemed to be ample time to submit a request for reconsideration.Note that Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 provides 10 days and Fed. R. App. P. 40 provides14 days for similar requests. Extensions under andSection;1.136(b) will beavailable to extend the time to file a response under andSection;andSection;1.196and 1.197. Extensions of time to file a notice of appeal to the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the Federal Circuit or to commence a civil action wouldbe governed exclusively by proposed andSection;1.304(a). See further discussionbelow.The PTO also proposes to amend andSection;1.136(a) to specifically referto andSection;1.136(b) for extensions of time to file responses under andSection;andSection;1.196and 1.197 and to refer to andSection;1.304 for extensions of time to initiatejudicial review. The proposed amendments add references to andSection;1.136(b)in andSection;1.197(b) and new andSection;1.196(f).Where appellant elects further prosecution before the examiner under andSection;1.196(b)(1), fee extensions of time under andSection; 1.136(a) to respondto the examiner's actions remain available.<ITAG tagnum="84">(4) Time for Seeking Judicial Review of Decisions of the BPAI andTTAB</ITAG>Currently, judicial review of final decisions of the BPAI or TTAB mustbe sought within sixty days of the decision or thirty days after a decisionon reconsideration. 37 CFR 1.304(a) and 2.146(d)(1). However, where a decisionon reconsideration is, in effect, a new decision, it is not clear whetherthe time for appeal is thirty or sixty days. The proposed amendments eliminateany confusion by providing a two-month period to appeal measured from eitherthe date of the decision or the decision on a timely filed request forreconsideration.Some problems have also arisen with respect to the specification of thetime for seeking judicial review in days. Miscalculations have resultedin filing untimely requests for judicial review. In order to simplify calculationof the time for judicial review, it is proposed to amend andSection;andSection;1.304(a) and 2.145(d)(1) to specify two months rather than sixty days.The two-month period meets the sixty-day requirement of 35 U.S.C. 142,145 and 146 and 15 U.S.C. 1071(a)(2) and (b)(1) except for time periodswhich include February 28. In order to comply with the sixty-day requirement,it is proposed to amend andSection;andSection; 1.304(b) and 2.145(d)(2) toprovide that an additional day shall be added to any two-month period forinitiating judicial review which includes February 28. Appeals will alwaysbe timely if the judicial review is initiated within two months of thefinal decision.Currently, the rules do not specify a time period for filing a cross-appealor cross-action in <T3>Inter partes</T3> cases. The absence of such a time period makes itdifficult for parties and their attorneys to make appropriate plans forjudicial review. For example, in an interference where there has been asplit judgment, one of the parties may be satisfied with the judgment butmay desire to appeal the adverse judgment only if an appeal is noted bythe other party. Where the appeal is filed on the last possible day, across-appeal is precluded. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,in its practice notes to Fed. Cir. R. 15, has noted that parties in agencyproceedings do not have the fourteen-day cross-appeal provided by Fed.R. App. P. 4(a)(3). The PTO proposes to amend andSection;andSection; 1.304(a)and 2.145(d)(1) by specifying that the time for filing a cross-appeal orcommencing a cross-action expires (1) fourteen days after service of thenotice of appeal or the summons and complaint or (2) two months after thedecision to be reviewed, whichever is later.Similarly, no provision for filing a cross-action is currently providedwhere an appellee elects to have further proceedings conducted in the districtcourt pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 146 or 15 U.S.C. 1071(a)(1). The PTO proposesto amend 37 CFR 1.304(c) and 2.145(d)(3) to provide that the time for filinga cross-action expires 14 days after service of the summons and complaint.Should the rule as proposed be adopted, the district court will determinewhether any cross-action was timely filed since neither the complaint norcross-action is filed in the PTO.<ITAG tagnum="84">(5) Extensions of Time to Seek Judicial Review</ITAG>Standards for granting requests for extensions of time to take an appealor commence a civil action vary depending upon which board is involvedand upon the particular proceeding before the board. Thus, under currentpractice, extensions relating to patent applications may be obtained bypaying the appropriate fee under andSection; 1.136(a). However, in a reexaminationproceeding or when judicial review is sought from a decision of the TTAB,the requester must demonstrate sufficient cause under andSection; 1.550(c)or andSection; 2.145(d)(1). The PTO intends to standardize the manner inwhich an extension of time to initiate judicial review may be obtained.The PTO proposes to adopt a standard which is similar to the standard usedin the Federal courts for granting extensions. Under the proposed rulesthe Commissioner may extend the time (1) for good cause if requested beforethe expiration of the time provided for initiating judicial review or (2)upon a showing of excusable neglect in failing to initiate judicial reviewif requested after the expiration of the time period. This standard willbe applicable in both trademark and patent proceedings (proposed andSection;andSection;1.304(a) and 2.145(e)) once the last decision, i.e., either the decision(in circumstances where no timely reconsideration is sought) or the decisionon reconsideration, of either board has been entered. In patent cases,extensions of time under andSection; 1.136(b) and andSection; 1.550(c) andfee extensions under 37 CFR 1.136(a) will no longer be available to extendthe time for the purpose of judicial review once a decision or a decisionon reconsideration has been entered. It is proposed to amend andSection;1.304(a) to state that the provisions of andSection;andSection; 1.136 and 1.550(c)are not available to extend the time to initiate judicial review. The PTOproposes to amend andSection;andSection; 1.136(a), 1.136(b), 1.191(d), 1.550(c),1.645(a) and (b) to refer to andSection; 1.304 for extensions of time forseeking judicial review after the decision has been entered. It is alsoproposed to further amend andSection; 1.645(a) by (1) adding the introductoryphrase ``Except to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal to theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or for commencing a civilaction,'' to the first sentence and (2) deleting the references to filinga notice of appeal or commencing a civil action in the second sentence.In view of the proposed amendments to andSection;andSection; 1.197 and 1.304,relating to extensions of time to seek reconsideration or initiate judicialreview, it is also proposed to amend andSection; 1.191(d) by eliminatingreference to andSection;andSection; 1.196 and 1.197.<ITAG tagnum="84">(6) Miscellaneous Amendments</ITAG>Currently, appellants may use fee extensions to delay the time for requestingan oral hearing at the BPAI. This delays final disposition of the appealand causes administrative problems and duplication of effort due to thetransfer of the appeal to the hearing docket. The PTO proposes to amendandSection;1.191(d) by deleting the reference to andSection;1.194. Under theproposed rules, extensions under andSection;1.136(b) will be available toextend the time to request an oral hearing.Section andSection;1.191(b) requires that appeals in an application or ina reexamination proceeding be signed by the applicant or patent owner orby a duly authorized attorney. It is proposed to eliminate the second sentenceof the rule and add reference to reexamination proceedings to the firstsentence. This proposed change merely combines the two sentences withoutany change in substance.Some confusion has resulted as to who has jurisdiction to take action ina patent application after a notice of appeal to the BPAI has been filed.Problems arise, for example, as to the appropriate PTO official to decidecertain petitions and other matters after an appeal has been filed. MPEPsection 1210 indicates that jurisdiction over the application normallypasses at one of five possible times listed therein. The PTO proposes toamend Rule 1.191 by adding a new section (e) which provides that jurisdictiontransfer to the BPAI when the application or reexamination file includingall briefs and examiner's answers is transmitted to the BPAI. Thus, jurisdictiontransfer to the BPAI when all written submissions by the applicant andthe examiner have been entered and the application papers have been forwardedto the BPAI.New paragraph 1.191(e) as proposed also includes a provision that the Commissioner,prior to the time the BPAI renders its decision, may <T3>sua sponte</T3> order that an application be remanded to the examinerfor further consideration. This provision merely makes explicit the inherentauthority of the Commissioner to direct and supervise the examination ofpatent applications.There is some confusion as to when ``termination of proceedings'' occursin situations where judicial review has been sought. The proposed amendmentto andSection;1.197(c) provides that proceedings are ``terminated'' whenthe Federal Circuit's mandate is received by the PTO or after the timefor appeal from the judgment of the district court in a civil action under35 U.S.C. 145 has expired. The PTO also proposes to eliminate the language``In such cases,'' in the second sentence of andSection;1.197(c) since itis superfluous and may be confusing.The PTO proposes to delete the phrase ``that he or she elects'' and substitute``electing'' therefor in andSection;andSection;1.304(c) and 2.145(c)(3). Theproposed amendment merely changes wording without any change in substance.It is also proposed to amend the last sentence of the preamble of andSection;1.196(b)by changing the verb ``make'' to ``makes'' to conform the verb to the singularsubject of the sentence.The PTO proposes to remove the portions or andSection;andSection;1.301, 1.303,2.145(a)(2) and 2.145(c)(3) which refer to transmittal of the certifiedlist and certified copies of the notice of election under 35 U.S.C. 141or 15 U.S.C. 1071(a)(1) to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.These procedures are required by applicable statutes or Court Rules andare unnecessary in the PTO's regulations.The PTO proposes to amend andSection;andSection;1.304(a), 1.304(c), 2.145(c)(3)and 2.145(d)(1) by including a statement that the certificate of mailingprovisions of andSection;1.8 are not applicable. No substantive change isinvolved since the inapplicability of andSection;1.8 is already stated inandSection;andSection;1.8(a)(2)(viii) and (ix).Sections 1.304(b) and 2.145(d)(2) provide that where the last day of theperiod for initiating judicial review is a ``Saturday, Sunday or legalholiday,'' the time is extended to the next day which is not one of thosedays. The PTO proposes to amend andSection;andSection;1.304(b) and 2.145(d)(2)to recite ``Federal holiday in the District of Columbia'' rather than ``legalholiday.'' These changes will merely conform the language of these sectionswith the language of 35 U.S.C. 21(b) and 37 CFR andSection;1.7.Additional proposed changes to andSection; 2.145 (c)(2) and (3) make changesin wording without any change in substance.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Considerations</ITAG>The proposed rule change will not have a significant impact on the qualityof the human environment or the conservation of energy resources.The proposed rule change is in conformity with the requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), Executive Orders 12291 and12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 350 et seq.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theChief Counsel for advocacy, Small Business Administration that the proposedrule change will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities [Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354].The proposed rule change requiring appellants to request reconsiderationunder the specific circumstances set forth would not be expected to resultin an increase of fees charged by attorneys and agents to entities, includingsmall entities, since the rule change is intended to eliminate erroneousgrounds for rejection prior to appeal and in some instances is expectedto eliminate the need for appeal.The Patent and Trademark Office has determined that this rule change isnot a major rule under Executive Order 12291. The annual effect to theeconomy will be less than $100 million. There will be no major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, stateor local government agencies, or geographic regions. There will be no significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.The PTO has also determined that this notice has no Federalism implicationsaffecting the relationship between the national government and the statesas outlined in Executive Order 12612.The rule change will not impose a burden under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq., since no record keeping or reportingrequirements within the coverage of the Act are placed upon the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 37 CFR, Part 1</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Courts, Freedom of information,Inventions and patents, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Smallbusinesses.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 37 CFR, Part 2</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Courts, Lawyers, Trademarks.For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Patent and Trademark Officeproposes to amend Parts 1 and 2 of Title 37 of the Code of the FederalRegulations as set forth below.
