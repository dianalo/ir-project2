The dollar drifted lower against the pound and the other major currencies.    The dollar traded most of the day in a tight range off its highs. It was quoted late yesterday at 125.70 yen, down from 126.05 Wednesday, and at 1.6765 marks, off slightly from 1.6785. Sterling was quoted at $1.8750, up from $1.8720.    In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at 125.65 yen.    Dealers said attention was focused on cross trades, or trading in non-dollar currencies, yesterday after the previous day's news reports and subsequent stampede of dollar purchases forced participants to cover short, or oversold, dollar positions above 125 yen.    According to news reports Wednesday, unidentified officials of Japan's Finance Ministry and central bank said the Group of Seven nations probably will reaffirm the joint statement of last Decemer that sought to stabilize the dollar at the 125-yen level. The Group of Seven members are the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.    Peter Rogers, chief dealer at Bank Leu in New York said, &quot;After the sudden move of (Wednesday), a lot of people were nervous about getting involved (Thursday), but when sterling started to move, they jumped on.&quot;    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, meanwhile, yesterday refused to comment on the reports the Group of Seven would set the 125-yen floor for the dollar. Mr. Baker, who spoke at Fordham University's Graduate School of Business, said the Group of Seven is &quot;pleased&quot; with the recent rate stability in the currency market.    In addition to withholding comment on the reports, Mr. Baker also refused to comment on target ranges for the dollar.    However, Mr. Baker said he doesn't expect a recession in 1988, and that the U.S. economy is considerably stronger than many thought it would be in the wake of the sharp stock market plunge.    Foreign exchange dealers said most market participants regarded the central banks' reported interventions as a smoothing action, and not a serious effort to cap the pound's rise.    According to traders, the banks intervened when the pound was trading for about 3.1385 marks. Within a few minutes after the intervention was reported, the pound had surpassed that level, however, and picked up momentum on interest in New York as Europe trading was closing. Late in New York yesterday, the pound was trading at 3.1434 marks.    &quot;What this means to us is that the Bank of England is going the intervention route rather than going for base rate cut,&quot; said Al Soria, foreign exchange manager at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. &quot;I think they're just trying to slow down sterling.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.80 an ounce to $450.80 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $448.60 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Thursday, April 7, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
