SUAREZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Troops and police went on alert Sundayafter authorities blocked bus convoys carrying thousands ofcivilians into Manila to distribute leaflets calling for a coup,officials said.   The leaflets distributed Saturday called for the militaryoverthrow of President Corazon Aquino's government, said theofficials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``The armed forces of the Philippines is now taking over thegovernment,'' the Manila newspaper Malaya quoted one of the leafletsas saying. ``We will replace unpatriotic government officials whoare only interested in building political parties.''   Police in the Manila suburb of Las Pinas said they detained about20 people who were spreading the leaflets, but all but five werereleased.   More than 1,000 other people were blocked by police when theyarrived in Las Pinas in a convoy of buses and jeeps from the nearbyprovince of Cavite.   In Manila's Sampaloc district, Col. Leonardo Orig of thePhilippine Constabulary said police intercepted 12 buses and fourjeeps carrying about 500 people, some of whom were handing outpro-coup leaflets. The group came from the northern provinces ofTarlac, Pampanga and La Union.   Similar movements were reported in other areas, including thecapital's financial district of Makati, where police rounded up morethan 100 people. All were released after a few hours of questioning.   ``Everything is normal now and we may lift the alert tonight ortomorrow,'' said Orig, who said the demonstrators had been paid.   Officials who asked not to be identified said they were told byinvestigators that right-wing extremists were using the convoys as away of ``testing the waters'' for mounting a possible coup attempt.   Authorities have foiled a half dozen coup attempts against Mrs.Aquino, who came to power after a civilian-military uprising inFebruary 1986 that ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.   In another development, forensic experts were trying to determineif skeletons exhumed in central Luzon were those of two womenallegedly slain in a military cover-up of the 1983 killing of Mrs.Aquino's husband.   The remains, exhumed Saturday, were being tested in Manila todetermine if they are those of two sisters who knew the maninitially thought to have killed former Sen. Benigno Aquino,according to officials of the National Bureau of Investigation.   Aquino was shot to death on Aug. 21, 1983, at the ManilaInternational Airport as soldiers escorted him out of a plane whenhe arrived home from three years of self-imposed exile in the UnitedStates.   Marcos and the military claimed Aquino was slain by RolandoGalman, an alleged communist agent killed by soldiers immediatelyafter Aquino was shot.   But a civilian board investigating the slaying concluded Aquinowas killed by one of his military escorts and Galman was ascapegoat. Investigators described Galman as an underworld figurewith links to military officials.   The bodies, suspected to be those of two hostesses at a barfrequented by Galman, were exhumed from a field just outside Capas,60 miles north of Manila. The grave was identified by fivemilitiamen who claimed military officers ordered them to bury thewomen in December 1983.   The Philippine Daily Inquirer and the Philippine Daily Globereported Sunday that the orders came from officers linked to EduardoCojuangco, Mrs. Aquino's first cousin and a close associate ofMarcos.   Cojuangco fled the country in 1986 and lives in California. Mrs.Aquino has banned him from returning.   The sisters, Anna and Catherine Oliva, disappeared in September1983.   Gen. Fabian Ver, then the military chief of staff, and 25 otherswere acquitted of killing Benigno Aquino in December 1985.   But a new Supreme Court constituted after Mrs. Aquino came topower ruled the first trial was manipulated by Marcos and ordered anew trial. The number of defendants has increased to 40, most ofthem soldiers.</TEXT></DOC>
