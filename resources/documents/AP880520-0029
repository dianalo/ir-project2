North about theIran-Contra affair could be used against them in court despiteimmunity grants, prosecutors say.   The prosecutors contend that hundreds of statements byPoindexter, fired National Security Council aide North, and armsdealer Albert Hakim during last year's hearings are not covered bythe limited grants of immunity they received from the congressionalIran-Contra committees.   These statements include Poindexter's admission that he approvedNorth's idea to help finance the Nicaraguan rebels with profitsfrom the U.S.-Iran arms sales and didn't tell President Reagan inorder to give him ``some future deniability'' if the operation wereexposed.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh contended in a courtfiling Thursday that he could also use statements by North andPoindexter that they destroyed documents during the November 1986investigation that Attorney General Edwin Meese III conducted afterthe arms-for-hostage deals became public.   Walsh made the legal claim in a filing in U.S. District Court onthe issue of whether his investigation was tainted by exposure ofprosecutors and grand jurors to the immunized testimony of thethree defendants.   The three are accused of conspiring with retired Air Force Maj.Gen. Richard V. Secord to defraud the government by divertingarms-sale profits to the Contras and obstructing inquiries byCongress and Meese about the operation.   The indictment includes charges that Poindexter and North madefalse statements to Congress by denying their involvement in theprivate network supplying the Contras and destroyed evidence duringMeese's probe.   Secord, who was Hakim's business partner, testified on CapitolHill without an immunity grant.   The so-called ``use immunity'' bars Walsh from using anindividual defendant's compelled congressional testimony asevidence against that person.   But in a brief filed by special counsel Herbert J. Stern, theindependent counsel contended that many answers by the threedefendants fell outside the immunity grant because they werevolunteered.   ``Volunteered testimony by defendants in their congresionaltestimony is not immunized and may be directly introduced at trialagainst them,'' said Stern, who was retained to handle the immunityissues.   Walsh offered to ``forgo the use of congressional testimony'' asdirect evidence against the defendants if the court would disposeof the immunity issue.   But the prosecution cited hundreds of examples of congressionaltestimony it contends could be used as evidence against thedefendants.   ``The transcripts reveal that the defendants intended to answerquestions that were not asked, to volunteer information that theywished to disclose, and to go beyond any fair reading of many ofthe questions that were asked,'' the brief said.   Supreme Court decisions ``clearly demonstrate that defendantsmay not turn an immunity grant into a license to volunteerinformation to bar prosecution,'' the independent counsel said.   The defense, in a separate filing, called the claim ``simplyabsurd.''   ``Each defendant claimed his privilege at the very outset andnever relinquished it,'' lawyers for North, Poindexter and Hakimsaid in a joint filing. ``The court should flatly reject the IC's(independent counsel's) attempt to circumvent the immunitystatute.''   Defense lawyers also urged the judge to dismiss the indictmenton the ground that Walsh took insufficient steps to isolate hisstaff from the defendants' immunized testimony, which ``has seepedinto every corner of this case.''   But the independent counsel defended his procedures, arguingthat the defense had failed to show that the investigation hadillegally relied on immunized testimony.   Walsh urged U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to set a trialdate, arguing that the defense request for further proceedings onthe immunity issue amounted to ``a transparent attempt at delay.''</TEXT></DOC>
