Brock Adams</HEAD><BYLINE>By RORY MARSHALL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Washington state politics were rocked lastSeptember when a young woman alleged that Sen. Brock Adams hadinvited her to his home, drugged her and sexually assaulted her.   Eight months later, no criminal charges or lawsuits have beenfiled. Adams goes on with his legislative work in Washington, D.C.   The Democratic senator has repeatedly denied the allegationsmade by Kari Tupper of Seattle, who said the incident occurred inMarch 1987 when she was a secretary on Capitol Hill. Adams, whoserved as transportation secretary under President Jimmy Carter,accused Tupper of demanding $400,000 in ``hush money'' from him.   Law enforcement authorities said charges were never filedagainst Adams because there was a of lack of evidence. Threats oflawsuits were tossed back and forth between Adams and the Tupperfamily, who had been old friends of the senator.   ``I discussed (the case) with my attorney, and it is verydifficult for a public official who has been a victim of falsestatements to take legal action,'' Adams said Thursday in a brieftelephone interview from Washington, D.C. ``I have put the matterbehind me and am moving forward to do my job in the Senate.''   Adams would not comment on whether the case would affect hisdecision on whether to run for re-election in 1992.   ``I have just put this whole thing behind me and that's all Ihave to say. ... I suggest others do the same,'' he said.   Kari Tupper, now 26, married and a graduate student in Englishat the University of Washington, did not return messages relayedthrough her mother and on her husband's answering machine at work.   Her mother, Sylvia Tupper, who once dated Adams, said the casewas on hold, and would not discuss it in detail.   ``Certain things are being tracked down,'' Mrs. Tupper said.``The thing is not dead. That's all I can tell you.''   Karen Marchioro, chair of the state Democrats, said she did notsee that the case had affected Adams politically.   ``I think he's doing a good job,'' she said. ``The only people Iever hear mention this are press people.''</TEXT></DOC>
