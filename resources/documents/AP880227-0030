LEVI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most Latin American governments expressedsupport for Eric Arturo Delvalle's failed attempt to fire militarystrongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, which cost Delvalle thepresidency of Panama.   Nicaragua and Cuba appeared alone among Latin American nationsin announcing their support for Noriega, whose backers in Panama'sNational Assembly ousted Delvalle early Friday after he tried todismiss the general.   Ending a three-day meeting in Cartagena, Colombia, the foreignministers of seven Latin American countries said they had suspendedPanama from their Group of Eight, a regional organization forpolitical and economic cooperation.   The foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela said in a communique that thesuspension was ordered because participation in the group requires``the clear operation of democratic institutions among members.''   The communique said the suspension would last ``until a newevaluation of the circumstances'' in Panama, where Noriega controlsthe 15,000-man military and police as Defense Forces chief.   In Managua, President Daniel Ortega on Friday pledged``unconditional solidarity'' with Noriega, who was indicted on drugtrafficking charges in Florida earlier this month.   Ortega said the general's problems began when ``the UnitedStates government arrived and told Gen. Noriega: `Gen. Noriega, weneed you to support us in an invasion against the Nicaraguanpeople' and Gen. Noriega and the Defense Forces of Panama said no.''   Panama helped the leftist Sandinistas in their guerrilla waragainst the Nicaraguan government of President Anastasio Somoza,who was ousted in July 1979. Noriega, considered the real powerbehind Panama's civilian government, was instrumental in the effort.   In Havana, the Cuban foreign ministry issued a statement blamingthe situation on an alleged U.S. campaign aimed at extending U.S.control of the Panama Canal, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latinasaid in a dispatch monitored Friday in Mexico City.   Under a 1977 treaty with the United States, Panama is to takeover the canal and its defense in 1999.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidFriday that the United States was not considering militaryintervention in Panama, where the U.S. Southern Command and its10,000 troops are based.   In a statement, the Venezuelan government expressed support forDelvalle's dismissal order of Noriega and called on Panama's armedforces to respect it.   ``The Venezuelan government reaffirms its unequivocal positionon the respect that the military forces in Panama owe to thecivilian power, as dictated by Panama's Constitution,'' said thebrief communique issued in Caracas.   In a brief statement, the Argentine government said Friday it``would like to make publicly known its solidarity with PresidentEric Delvalle.''   El Salvador's vice president, Rodolfo Castillo Claramount,called Delvalle's ouster ``nothing more than a simple and vulgarcoup d'etat carried out by a group of military gorillas headed byNoriega.''   Castillo Calamount told a news conference Friday that theSalvadoran government ``is seriously considering the possibility ofsuspending diplomatic relations with the new Panamaniangovernment.''</TEXT></DOC>
