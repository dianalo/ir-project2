The Association of General Chairman, a group comprising theleadership of the railroad's 16 unions and 6,500 members, issued astatement saying terms of the proposal would not be revealed.   Ed Wytkind, a spokesman for the group, said the proposal wassubmitted to a committee of independent CNW board members byFriday's 5 p.m. deadline for offers. He said the proposal calls foremployees ultimately to hold a one-third share in the recapitalizedcompany, with shareholders retaining the remaining two-thirds.   ``We will not discuss the bidders or the bids received,'' CNWspokesman James Foote said.   Japonica Partners has offered $44 a share for outstanding CNWstock. The New York-based investment group already owns 8.8 percentof CNW's shares.   CNW rose 75 cents to $46.50 a share Friday on the New York StockExchange.   Soon after Japonica launched its tender offer, CNW urgedshareholders not to sell their stock while the company searched forother potential buyers.   In its statement, the CNW employee group said it was undertakinga buyout to keep CNW intact and avoid ``splintering'' of thecompany's rail system, which covers 6,000 miles in nine states.   ``We will not stand by and allow this railroad to fall victim tothe often devastating effects of leveraged buyouts,'' said EllisJohnson, president of the union association. ``The best way toavoid such a fate is to take the matter into our own hands.''   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly withborrowed funds that are repaid with money from the target's cashflow or raised by the sale of its assets.   CNW defeated Japonica's attempt to elect its own slate ofdirectors at the annual shareholders' meeting last month.</TEXT></DOC>
