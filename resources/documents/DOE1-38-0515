<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-38-0515 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors describe a convenient interface between UNIX-based work-stationsor minicomputers, and supercomputers such as the CRAY series machines.Using this interface, the user can issue commands entirely on the UNIXsystem, with remote compilation, loading and execution performed on thesupercomputer. The interface is not a remote login interface. Ratherthe domain of various UNIX utilities such as compilers, archivers andloaders are extended to include the supercomputer. The user need knowessentially nothing about the supercomputer operation system, commandsor filename restrictions. Standard UNIX utilities will perform supercomputeroperations transparently. UNIX command names and arguments are mappedto corresponding supercomputer equivalents, suitable options are selectedas needed, UNIX directory tree filenames are coerced to allowable supercomputernames and all source and output files are automatically transferred betweenthe machines. The primary purpose of the software is to allow the programmerto benefit from the interactive features of UNIX systems including screeneditors, software maintenance utilities such as make and SCCS, and varioustext manipulation utilities. The interface was designed particularlyto support development of very large multi-file programs, possibly consistingof hundreds of files and hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Allsupercomputer source is kept on the work-station.</TEXT></DOC>
