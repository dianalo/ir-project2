Chairman Don Johnston told shareholders at the annual meeting that troubled JWT and its various units aren't for sale.    &quot;JWT Group is not for sale, none of JWT Group's companies are for sale, nor are any parts of any JWT Group companies for sale,&quot; he told a packed house at the meeting. Mr. Johnston, who is also chief executive officer, later denied specifically that JWT's Hill andamp; Knowlton public relations unit was on the block, saying that those &quot;persistent reports have a life of their own.&quot;    JWT has been rumored to be a takeover target for a number of months because of its poor earnings performance. More recently, as an outgrowth of the original takeover rumors, there were reports that the company had put its Hill andamp; Knowlton unit on the block.    Terence D. Martin, JWT's chief financial officer, also said at the meeting that the advertising and public relations company's earnings goal for 1987 &quot;is to beat 1985.&quot;    &quot;At this point in time, we think our plan is achievable,&quot; Mr. Martin said. In 1985, JWT earned $19.4 million, or $1.97 a share, on revenue of $582.4 million. In 1986, the company's net income slid to $5.9 million, or 60 cents a share, despite increased revenue of $649 million. For this year's first-quarter, the company had a $1.4 million loss, compared with year-earlier profit, on revenue of $159.7 million.    JWT has been the target of criticism from both Madison Avenue and Wall Street in recent months. Its financial performance has been among the worst of all the publicly held ad agencies, and Mr. Johnston has drawn fire for dismissing two top executives and allowing two others to resign because of differences with him.    Yet there was little sign of discord at the annual meeting. Holders applauded when JWT showed two videotapes of commercials made for its clients, including Pillsbury Co.'s Burger King unit and computer giant International Business Machines Corp. They applauded again when a shareholder complimented Mr. Johnston on how orderly his meeting was. Questions from shareholders were few.    In response to one query, Mr. Johnston noted the expansion of non-traditional advertising-related businesses, such as direct marketing. &quot;We haven't participated in the growth&quot; of such areas, and they represent &quot;one of our opportunities,&quot; he said. After the meeting, however, he said that &quot;nothing specific&quot; is planned in those new areas for now, and that beefing them up is &quot;up to the U.S.&quot; unit of Thompson.    Though securities analysts have lowered their 1987 earnings estimates since the poor first-quarter, Mr. Johnston was upbeat. He said that &quot;1986 was an unacceptable year in terms of profitablity. We have reorganized and reshaped our individual companies. . . . It's time for our shareholders to reap the proper benefits.&quot;    Separately, Stephen G. Bowen Jr., president of the U.S. unit, confirmed reports that yet another senior Thompson executive, Joseph Schulte, is leaving the company. Mr. Schulte most recently was the head of the world-wide Ford Motor Co. account, and before that was general manager of Thompson's Detroit office. Mr. Bowen said he didn't know &quot;whether that (leaving) was initiated by Don (Johnston) or Joe.&quot;    Mr. Johnston announced a reorganization last week in an attempt to pare JWT's many layers of management. </TEXT></DOC>
