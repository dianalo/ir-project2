Hostile bidders, theHafts and KKR, had descended on the nation's second largestgrocery chain.   When the September 1988 story came out, &quot;people werecrying in the hall,&quot; says Joseph Pichler, Kroger's president.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;`Make this go away,' they told me. I said, `I wish Icould.'&quot;   He did. Faced with much the same threat to itsindependence as rival Safeway faced two years earlier, Krogerchose a very different path. Instead of going private in aKKR-led LBO, Kroger officials countered by offeringshareholders a hefty dividend and employees a significantownership stake in what remains a public company.   While Kroger had to take on $4.1 billion in debt and ithad to cut costs, it sold far fewer assets than Safeway didand reduced its work force by about 3%, while Safeway reducedits by about a third. Yet today Kroger has about the sameoperating-profit per employee as Safeway.   In some ways, Kroger's story undermines two LBO articlesof faith: That a company under attack from raiders has to goprivate to ward them off, and that, after an LBO, laborforces have to be cut severely to support the resultinginterest burden.   This isn't to suggest, however, that an LBO can't bestructured to share ownership more broadly or to cut costs ina less severe manner than Safeway, or that recapitalizationsare panaceas. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich plunged into crisisafter its recapitalization when it couldn't sell assets forenough cash to pay down its huge debt.   But the recap seems to have worked so far for Kroger. &quot;Wekept asking ourselves the question, if it's so good for anoutside group of investors to come in, leverage up a company,peel off underperforming assets, pay down debt and walk offwith the equity themselves, why shouldn't it be equally goodfor our existing shareholders to benefit from exactly thesame transaction?&quot; Mr. Pichler recalls.   Safeway says it looked at the same question two yearsearlier but chose to do an LBO because it would free thecompany from having to please shareholders with short-termprofits and from future takeover threats. Certain tax breakssince rescinded also made the LBO option more attractive in1986 than in later years.   For Kroger, the call to action came when the Hafts offered$55-a-share for a &quot;business combination.&quot; Then KKR made anunsolicited bid -- despite its reputation as a &quot;white knight&quot;-- to buy out the company for $58.50 a share. When Krogerturned a cold shoulder, KKR upped its offer to $64.   Kroger quickly unfurled its plan: Shareholders would get a$40 a share cash dividend, plus an $8 junior subordinateddebenture and a remaining interest in the company, calledstub stock. The package was valued by Kroger at $57 to $61 ashare. The recap plan also liberalized stock options so thatall employees, rather than a thin slice at the top, couldincrease their ownership: Employees could go from owning 6%to more than 25% of Kroger's shares; corporate officers'ownership, on the other hand, could rise only from 1% to 3%.   The recap lagged by at least 5% to 10% behind KKR's $64final bid. Even so, the board approved the recap on September23 and the company remained public. Investors and employeesreacted favorably to the offer. The value of the stub stockinitially more than doubled but has since slipped to $14,still well above the initial offering price of $9.13. AndKroger workers took ample advantage of the new stock options.By 1990, Kroger increased employee ownership even more, to35%.   The recap yielded them tens of millions of dollars forsenior managers. Lyle Everingham, the chairman, got anestimated $10.5 million in cash and another $2.3 million indebentures. Mr. Pichler got $3.5 million in cash and $763,000in debentures. And Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., made $25 million foradvising Kroger.   In the aftermath, Kroger too was faced with amulti-billion-dollar debt. It laid off 314 people fromheadquarters, and with the subsequent asset sales, purgedmore than 4,000 employees from the payroll.   But the Kroger severance package was more generous thanSafeway's. Fired employees received a month's salary forevery year of service to a maximum of nine months, comparedwith a maximum of eight weeks salary at Safeway. They alsogot medical benefits for one year, while Safeway employeeslost their benefits in as little as two weeks.   Kroger's generosity shouldn't be overstated, though:Kroger cut costs by cutting average hourly salaries of $8.12(or $11.39 with fringe benefits) in 1985 to $7.07 (or $9.84with benefits) in 1989. Kroger, like Safeway, saved money bypaying its specialty department workers a lower rate. AndKroger has also negotiated two-tier pay scales and raisedeligibility requirements for medical benefits.   In selling assets, Kroger sold less-prized properties anda total of 100 stores, only 10% of its operations. Safeway,on the other hand, sold 1,100 of its 2,325 stores. Krogeralso turned to employees who generated thousands ofcost-saving steps.   Like Safeway, Kroger has adopted an incentive bonus plan,but it appears to be more democratic than its Oaklandrival's. Kroger's new bonus system extends to secretaries andthe plan adjusts for factors beyond employees' control-suchas working in a store in a high-crime neighborhood.   &quot;We're fairly excited about Kroger's bonus plan,&quot; says EdHardy, a national negotiator for the United Food andCommercial Workers Union. &quot;It's more of a gain-sharing planthan a bonus based on profits.&quot;   While Kroger has improved its profit-sharing plan, Safewaystopped contributing to its plan in 1987. At the same time,Safeway also tried unsuccessfully to raid surplus funds inits employee retirement account, which provides retirees withan average pension of less than $400 a month. Retireesretained counsel to halt the raid, and Robert Van Gemert,retired Safeway general counsel, did some research anddiscovered that the original Safeway pension charter in factgrants the surplus to the retirees.   So far, Kroger seems to be faring competitively at leastas well as Safeway. In fiscal year 1989, its first year afterrestructuring, Kroger's cash flow rose 22% -- better than the16% gain the company originally forecast at the time itrestructured. Kroger, like Safeway, hasn't raised prices-andin some markets has lowered them. And Kroger, like Safeway,managed to refinance its bank-credit agreement and lowerinterest expenses.   But Kroger also now supports 60,000 more workers thanSafeway, while maintaining a similar operating profit as apercentage of sales.   Kroger also has increased its charitable cashcontributions since the recap to $3.6 million last year from$2.1 million in 1987, while Safeway trimmed its corporatecash giving to $2.7 million last year from $3.2 million in1986.   Thanks to the massive debt, Kroger operated at a net lossof $72.7 million in 1989; Safeway's net loss was $488 millionits first year after the buy-out. (The two chains are fairlycomparable in number of stores and in sales.) By the firstquarter of 1990, Kroger's net loss had shrunk to $10 million,a 46% improvement from the same period a year earlier. Andanalysts are estimating earnings for next year.   &quot;Kroger is an extremely strong company today, with verystrong cash flow and very strong markets,&quot; says Debra Levin,a retail analyst who follows Kroger for Salomon Brothers. &quot;Ifthey had been taken over (in an LBO), they might not look allthat different from the way they look today, but I don't knowthat they would have gotten that same motivation level fromtheir employees.&quot;   (See related story: The Reckoning: Safeway LBO Yields VastProfits but Exacts A Heavy Human Toll The '80s-Style Buy-OutLeft Some Employees Jobless, Stress-Ridden, Distraught OwnerKKR Hails Efficiency -- WSJ May 16, 1990)   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          KROGER Co. doesn't have as high an operating profit peremployee as Safeway Stores Inc.
