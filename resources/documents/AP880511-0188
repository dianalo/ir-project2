Gen. Hector Alejandro Gramajo Morales told a news conferece``there were some signs of indiscipline'' at the two army bases,``but they were immediately neutralized and the officers involvedimmediately changed their attitude.''   Earlier, a statement from the defense ministry said a coupattempt had taken place. Throughout the country, the mediainterpreted the events as an attempted coup against PresidentVinicio Cerezo's civilian government.   But in reading from a prepared statement at the news conference,Gramajo Morales refused to admit that a coup attempt or a mutinywas involved. He also tried to minimize the incidents that occurredat dawn today, saying they were short lived and the rest of thearmy's 74 bases and installations were not involved.   The general claimed the officers involved in the ``acts ofindiscipline'' were fooled and disoriented by ``speculation anddisinformation'' propagated by unnamed civilians.   Gramajo Morales said two officers at the bases involved _Jutiapa, 74 miles west of the capital, and Retalhuleu, 115 milessoutheast of the capital _ have been arrested and are beinginvestigated by military authorites.   He did not identify them by name or rank.   Cerezo, a lawyer and leader of the Christian Democratic Party,was inaugurated in January 1986, replacing a military governmentthat had taken power three years earlier in a palace coup.   The government and military had been in agreement on one of themajor issues in Guatemala, whether to resume peace talks withleftist guerrillas.   Gramajo said in an interview with The Associated Press this yearthat the rebels first must abandon their weapons and said ``thearmy is very close to achieving a total victory.''   Leftist guerrillas have been fighting the civilian governmentand a succession of military or military-dominated governments for27 years. The first round of peace talks ever held in theinsurgency took place last October in Madrid, Spain.   The government had been resisting rebel calls for another round.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley saidpreliminary reports indicated that some military units wereinvolved in a coup attempt but she had no details.   She reaffirmed U.S. support for civilian democracy in Guatemala.   Cerezo succeeded Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, who tookcontrol in August 1983 from another military ruler, Gen. EfrainRios Montt. Rios Montt came to power after young army officersstaged a coup in March 1982 that overthrew the rightist governmentof Gen. Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia.   The elections in November 1985 were the first in 16 years inwhich the military did not field a candidate.   On Monday, the national police said gunmen fired at the house ofMario Sandoval Alarcon, leader of the rightist National LiberationMovement, over the weekend.   The previous week, hand grenades were tossed at the homes of twomen who served in the governments of Rios Montt and Mejia Victores.There were no claims of responsibility.</TEXT></DOC>
