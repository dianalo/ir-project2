With the supply of oil and refined products for near-term delivery dissipating, &quot;the market is really crude short,&quot; said Richard Redoglia, an oil broker at Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. in New York.    Much of the price advance came on buying by computer-driven commodity pools and short covering, or buying contracts to offset those sold earlier, traders said.    Some buying, though, was driven by continued signs of discipline among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, analysts said.    For instance, Kuwait's oil minister, Sheikh Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, was quoted in a Kuwaiti daily newspaper as saying that OPEC output is 13.4 million barrels a day, or 15% below the group's ceiling of 15.8 million barrels.    Saudi Arabia crude oil production averaged 2.7 million to 2.9 million barrels a day for the first three weeks of March, compared with its quota of 4.13 million barrels, a private oil-industry analyst told the Dow Jones International Petroleum news service.    Crude oil for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 44 cents a barrel to $18.71. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures also posted gains.    On the spot, or noncontract, market, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. bellwether crude, rose 40 cents a barrel to $19. And the April price of North Sea Brent, the abundantly traded European blend, rose 20 cents to $18.25 in late trading.    Some traders suggested that inventory statistics released by an industry group after the market closed yesterday could lead to some selling today.    The American Petroleum Institute reported, among other things, that U.S. refiners operated at 78.7% of capacity in the week ended Friday, up from 75.7% the week before, portending more refined products on the market in coming weeks.    In other futures markets yesterday:    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Prices ended mixed as Japanese yen futures closed higher following a steep decline in the dollar to a postwar low against the yen in Tokyo trading Tuesday. European currencies closed slightly lower following intervention in support of the dollar by the Bank of Japan. Yen futures for June delivery hit a life-of-contract high of 0.6777 during the day before pulling back slightly to close at 0.6736, up 0.0038. &quot;I don't think anyone has a handle on why the yen is really going up like this so fast,&quot; said Jill Cotter, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. The Bank of Japan, she said, spent more than $1 billion to support the dollar during Far Eastern trading hours then was rumored to have bought &quot;a few more billion&quot; worth of dollars through the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board during British and U.S. trading hours, respectively. But the Fed, rather than the Bank of Japan, will have to take the lead in supporting the dollar to avert a continued slide, said Craig Sloane, a futures analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    PRECIOUS METALS: Silver futures soared to six-month highs, leading other precious metals prices upward in active trading for the second consecutive day. Buying by computer-guided commodity pools and technical factors fueled most of the advance, analysts and traders said. &quot;The silver bulls are coming out of hibernation,&quot; said Richard Maseri, senior trader at Private Securities Corp. in Miami. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for May delivery rose 16.5 cents an ounce, to $5.945. The last time prices were higher was Sept. 22, when they stood at $5.986. Meanwhile, April gold rose $3.30 an ounce to $414.10, and April platinum surged $14.80 an ounce to $545.20. Despite silver's rally of more than four cents an ounce, or about 7%, this week alone, many analysts are cautious about further advances. &quot;The gains will have to be sustained for the rally to be convincing,&quot; said John Norris, director of precious metals trading at Citibank in New York. &quot;That's going to be the game plan over the next few days.&quot;    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat climbed on rumors about a Soviet purchase from the U.S. The purchases, though, were doubted by many analysts. The buying would have occured without U.S. government subsidy and at prices higher than those of competitors like Argentina, the analysts said. &quot;The only thing that is certain is that the market closed with good gains,&quot; said Ted Mao, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. The reason could be just as simply commercial buying or lack of selling, Mr. Mao said, &quot;but that's not as romantic as Soviet purchases.&quot; Most corn and soybean prices rose in tandem with wheat. The market also got a boost from lack of farmer selling and a separate rumor that the Soviets had purchased more U.S. corn, analysts said.    SUGAR: Some futures plunged more than 0.5 cent a pound after breaching important technical levels, but there were no new fundamental factors to account for the selling, said William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc. in New York. The contract for May delivery on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York dropped 0.55 cent a pound to settle at 7.16 cents. The contract has no daily trading limit. The July contract, also unlimited, declined 0.58 cent to 7.26 cents. Other futures declined their daily limit of 0.5 cent. Technically based selling caused prices to dive through the 7.45-7.50 cents barrier regarded as a support level then through a second support level of 7.24 cents. Mr. O'Neill linked the drop to &quot;what has been taken out of the market.&quot; During the recent price runup, large Soviet purchases and Cuban crop problems were expected, he said. But now &quot;the Soviet Union is expected to buy only a little bit at most and the Cuban crop may be bigger than last year,&quot; making the market vulnerable to selling, he said. The market's moves recall last April, when the market reached highs on expectation of Soviet buying, became overbought, then &quot;fell and never looked back,&quot; said Judy Weissman, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    STOCK INDEXES: Futures rose slightly. The day's gaping spreads between Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures and the index itself, which lagged behind, weren't enough to attract the computer-packing arbitrage traders who propelled the stock and stock-index futures markets higher Friday and Monday. &quot;Most of these traders are fully invested,&quot; said Gerald Walsh, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Weakness in the dollar and Treasury bond futures also kept the stock-index futures rally in check, other analysts said. Many investors are looking for at least a temporary price retreat in stocks and index futures when the Dow Jones Industrial Average hits 2400 and the Sandamp;P 500 stock-index future for June delivery reaches 308 to 310, Mr. Walsh said. </TEXT></DOC>
