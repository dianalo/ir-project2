(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Buddy Roemer today denied clemency for aretarded man scheduled to go to the electric chair Thursday formurdering a state trooper at 17.   Roemer rejected the recommendation of the Louisiana PardonBoard, which voted 3-2 Monday that he commute Dalton Prejean'ssentence to life in prison.   The governor's announcement came minutes after the 5th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans turned down an appeal fromPrejean, now 30.   Louisiana's longest-serving death row inmate is scheduled to dieshortly after midnight on Thursday for the 1977 slaying of TrooperDonald Cleveland. Prejean has been on death row for nearly 12 years.   The U.S. Supreme helped clear the way for his execution in Julywhen it ruled in separate cases that the Constitution's ban oncruel and unusual punishment does not bar the execution ofmurderers who are retarded or were juveniles when they killed.   In Virginia and Alabama, two killers described respectively asborderline retarded and mildly retarded were put to death in Augustand July after the ruling.   Yvonne Foreman, chairman of the pardon board, said the majorityvoted for clemency based on testimony that Prejean had been abusedas a child, that he probably suffered some brain damage as a childand that he had a good prison record and showed remorse.   The appeals argued that Prejean, who is black, had an all-whitejury and an ineffective court-appointed lawyer. The jury was nevertold that he was abused as a child, that he is mildly retarded orthat he was drinking heavily the night of the murder.   Six months before the killing, Prejean was released from areform school to which he had been sent for killing a taxi driverat age 14.   Prejean has expressed his regrets to the family of the trooperhe shot twice in the face with a .38-caliber pistol after a trafficstop.   ``I ask them not to hate me for all of their life,'' saidPrejean, who was shackled during his testimony before the board atthe state prison. ``That same hate can destroy them.''   Prejean blamed most of his problems on an unhappy childhood. ``Iwas always charged with being wrong even when I tried to do right.''   David Baer, a psychiatrist at the University of MassachusettsSchool of Medicine, said he examined Prejean in 1984 and believesthat while Prejean knows right from wrong, apparent brain damagemakes it difficult for him to deliberate when in a violent mood.   If allowed to live, Prejean could be the subject of tests thatmight help others with similar brain problems to avoid violence,Baer said.   ``His death would teach us absolutely nothing,'' he said.   David Smith, father of the trooper's widow and spoksman for thefamily, said Cleveland's relatives wanted justice, not revenge.   ``If we're going to have a death penalty, let's use it. If wedon't want it, let's do away with it. But let's don't drag thesethings out 12 years.''</TEXT></DOC>
