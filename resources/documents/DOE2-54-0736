The project was later extended to include balance-of-paymentsscenarios and impacts on OPEC domestic demand. As the study progressed,a number of preliminary presentations were made at the US Departmentof Energy in order to receive feedback from DOE officials and to refinethe focus of our analysis. During one of the presentations on June 4,1987, the then Director of Division of Oil and Gas, John Stanley-Miller,advised us to focus our work on the Persian Gulf countries, since thesecountries were of special interest to the United States Government. Sincethen, our team has visited Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and SaudiArabia and obtained detailed information from other countries. The politicalturmoil in the Gulf, the Iran/Iraq war, and the active US military presencehave all worked to delay the final submission of our report. Even incountries where the United States has close ties, access to informationhas been difficult. In most countries, even mundane information on petroleumissues are treated as national secrets. As a result of these difficulties,we requested a one-year no cost extension to the grant and submittedan Interim Report in May 1988. As part of our grant extension request,we proposed to undertake additional tasks which appear in this report.20 figs., 21 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
