ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Several major banks lowered their prime lendingrates half a percentage point to 11 percent today, responding tothe decline of interest rates on financial markets.   Citibank, the nation's largest bank, was the first to announceit had lowered its prime lending rate. Several other big banks,including Chase Manhattan Bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., ChemicalBank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and Bankers Trust Co.,quickly followed suit.   Today's decline was the first drop in the prime rate _ used as abase for a variety of other interest rates, including those onconsumer loans _ since Feb. 2, 1988. On that day, the prime fell0.25 percentage points to 8.5 percent, but then began a climb thatended today.   The latest decline places the prime rate back at the level itreached on Feb. 10 of this year, when it rose to 11 percent from10.5 percent. Two weeks later, on Feb. 24, it rose another 0.5percentage points to 11.5 percent, and remained at that level untiltoday.   Economists said today's decline came in response to marketinterest rate trends.   ``The banks have finally acknowledged the drop in rates that hasoccurred in recent weeks,'' said Ward McCarthy, a managing directorof Stone andamp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc., a money marketresearch firm based in Princeton, N.J.   The Federal Reserve pushed interest rates higher early this yearto keep the economy from overheating. But rates have fallenrecently ``primarily because the economy has clearly lost a lot ofsteam,'' McCarthy said.   On Feb. 24, the interest rate on the Treasury's 30-year bond was9.18 percent, while today, the yield was quoted at 8.43 percent.   McCarthy said it was somewhat surprising that the banks decidedto act although the Fed has not yet eased its stand on interestrates.   ``I think it's pretty much a foregone conclusion that the Fedwill ease policy,'' he said.   But economists also did not foresee the Fed allowing rates toplunge.   ``They have not yet been convinced that the inflation dragon hasbeen tamed,'' said Donald Ratajczk, director of economicforecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta.   The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money,including interest it pays on customer accounts, short-termcertificates of deposit and bonds, and as such mirrors rather thanforecasts rate trends.</TEXT></DOC>
