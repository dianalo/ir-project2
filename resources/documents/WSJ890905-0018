For years a propellant of the U.S. Treasury market, Japanese money is beginning to play its magic on the U.S. stock market. Increasingly in the past five months, brokers and traders say &quot;the Japanese, the Japanese&quot; when asked to explain market rallies. The Japanese &quot;carry more mystique and often when they show their face, they move the market dramatically,&quot; says Chung Lew, head trader at Kleinwort Benson Inc. in New York.    After selling a net $104 million of foreign stocks in the first quarter, Japanese investors added $6.03 billion to their portfolios in the following three months, according to Japan's Ministry of Finance. June's net purchases of $3.26 billion set a record; brokers estimate purchases dropped in July but still exceeded sales. Japanese analysts reckon that 60% to 70% of the buying represents U.S. shares.    Even those analysts who argue that the Japanese now affect the U.S. equity market only at the margin concede the influence could someday be enormous. Noting that less than 4% of Japanese institutions' total assets are invested in U.S. equities, John A. Conlon Jr., an executive vice president at the U.S. unit of Nikko Securities Co. in New York, says: &quot;They've got the potential to be quite significant.&quot;    Indeed. Analysts at Daiwa Securities Co. say that Nippon Life Insurance Co., Japan's biggest institutional investor, brings in roughly $150 million a day, an amount equal to more than a million shares of IBM. &quot;We figured it would take them 200 days to buy the whole company,&quot; says one Daiwa executive in New York.    For the most part, Japanese investors -- institutions and individuals alike -- are buying such big, blue-chip names as Sears Roebuck, Boeing, Du Pont, Coca-Cola and American Express. Not surprisingly, brokerage firms are recommending many of these same stocks, with their &quot;buy&quot; lists often overlapping. For instance, 13 of 27 U.S. stocks on a Daiwa August &quot;buy&quot; list also are among 36 that Nomura Securities Co. recommended in May. They include Merck, United Technologies, General Electric, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph and Anheuser-Busch.    To some observers, Japanese investors are the rhinoceroses of the U.S. stock market: clumsy behemoths who indiscriminately pour large sums into household-name equities. Many U.S. competitors also regard them as neophytes when it comes to sophisticated trading techniques.    &quot;I get real concerned when I hear that they are buying for a sustained period,&quot; says James Wright, senior managing director at Banc One Asset Management Corp. &quot;There is a good chance that I will sell stocks to them that they will keep running up. They are trend followers, price momentum-oriented.&quot; A momentum trader buys stocks when prices are rising and sells them in declining markets.    Mr. Wright invests with the aid of a computer that points out companies with high growth rates but low price-earnings ratios. In 1987, Mr. Wright says, Japanese buying would often &quot;overvalue&quot; stocks in his portfolio and his computer program would put them on a sell list.    About 10% of the stocks on Nomura and Daiwa's &quot;buy&quot; lists turned up this summer on Mr. Wright's computer as candidates for selling. In August, his computer flagged Procter andamp; Gamble, Waste Management, Disney, Motorola, AMR and Monsanto, among others, as stocks to sell. All of them are on Daiwa's &quot;buy&quot; list, and the last five are on Nomura's.    Noting the long, steady rise of the Tokyo stock market, Kenji Kaga, a broker at Daiwa's U.S. unit, says that Japanese investors see no problem with investing in rising markets &quot;because that's the way the Tokyo market is. They don't think they're late when the market goes up, because of the Tokyo experience.&quot;    The Japanese are investing in stock markets other than the U.S., particularly Britain's and West Germany's. But the U.S. market -- the world's second biggest after Japan -- and big U.S. companies offer Tokyo money managers liquidity, which is the ability to buy and sell large blocks without distorting prices.    &quot;Liquidity is very important to Japanese investors and is getting more and more important,&quot; says Seiyu Nakao, chief strategist for Nomura Research Institute's U.S. arm.    That also applies to the over-the-counter market, where big Tokyo brokers are recommending Apple Computer and MCI Communications but few others. &quot;It's hard to sell small stocks without moving the market,&quot; says Mr. Nakao.    Thrusting Japanese investors toward American stocks are an unexpectedly strong dollar and a need to diversify the riches generated by Japan's high savings rate and large trade surplus.    &quot;The most important factor is dollar stabilization,&quot; says Mr. Nakao. &quot;We now think the dollar has hit bottom.&quot; A stable dollar protects Japanese U.S. investments against losses from currency depreciation. Similarly, a rising dollar increases the value of foreign holdings in yen terms. And although the U.S. currency has declined from its mid-June highs, &quot;a lot of Japanese institutions insulated themselves from its fall by hedging,&quot; says Mark Cliffe, chief economist at Nomura's London unit. &quot;That means they are more relaxed about investing in the U.S. market.&quot;    Moreover, U.S. shares look cheap to Japanese investors. Tokyo stock prices average about 65 times their per-share earnings, five to six times what U.S. stocks sell for. In addition, Japanese dividends on average equal 0.5% of share prices, compared with 3.4% for U.S. stocks.    Japanese familiarity with overseas equities is enhanced by the 114 foreign companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, 66 of which are U.S. Twenty-one of 36 U.S. companies that Nomura recommended to its Japanese clients also carry Tokyo listings.    So far this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed 27%, compared with 14% for the Nikkei index of 225 stocks listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.    At the same time, Mr. Nakao predicts that &quot;the U.S. economy will {experience} a soft landing,&quot; meaning moderate growth and low inflation, &quot;and U.S. interest rates will decline further.&quot; Both, he adds, are good for equities.    Japan's so-called Big Four securities firms -- Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi Securities Co. -- have been promoting foreign, particularly U.S., equities. &quot;For the first time, you have a concerted effort on the part of the Big Four in beating the retail investor over the head to buy U.S. stocks,&quot; says a senior executive at one of the firms.    There are signs the Japanese are trying to become more sophisticated investors. Nikko showed up on the New York Stock Exchange's list of the 15 most active program traders in July, the first appearance by a Japanese institution. Nikko's trading didn't involve index arbitrage, but a Chicago futures trader says that at least three of the Big Four are getting ready to start index arbitrage trading.    Moreover, Nikko in July agreed to pay $125 million for a 50% interest in Wells Fargo andamp; Co.'s investment advisory group, known for its sophisticated, computerized investment techniques. Index arbitrage involves rapidly buying and selling stocks and stock-index futures to take advantage of price differences between the two.    For the past few years, Japanese institutions have used futures to hedge currency risk. Chicago traders say they are now starting to hedge stock positions as well, trading through big Midwestern futures firms such as Refco Group Ltd. Some Japanese life-insurance companies and trust banks also have given money to U.S. money managers to program trade, but these efforts are still regarded as mostly experiments.    &quot;They are still in the learning stage, and the Japanese market is now trying to catch up with the U.S.,&quot; says Mr. Kaga of Daiwa. That includes chasing potential takeover candidates such as Avon, Eastman Kodak, UAL and Warner-Lambert.    ---@ Nomura's U.S. Stock Picks @ The Japanese brokerage firm's recommendations on May 1, 1989 @ % CHANGE @ 5/1/89 @ NAME TO 9/1/89 @ AMR Corp. 42.7% @ Walt Disney 38.3 @ Philip Morris 30.2 @ Motorola 27.7 @ Waste Management 27.2 @ Federal Express 26.8 @ Limited Inc. 25.6 @ Monsanto 24.7 @ Coca-Cola 22.8 @ PepsiCo 21.2 @ General Electric 19.5 @ Amer.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.82 to 2752.09, a record. Broader averages also set records: Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.28 to 353.73, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.10 to 196.37. The American Stock Exchange index also touched a new high, rising 1.77 to 383.96.    Advancing issues on the Big Board outpaced decliners 897 to 498. Some 133,300,000 shares traded on the Big Board, the second lightest trading day of the week.    The third-quarter winning streak stayed alive as well. The Dow industrials rose for the ninth week in a row, the longest such stretch since late 1985. Last week, the average gained 19.73 points, or 0.7%.    Purchasing managers said the economy declined in August for the fourth consecutive month. But the August labor report suggested that economic growth remains resilient. Stock buyers clearly sided with the view that the economy remains strong. Cyclical stocks -- which rise and fall with the pace of economic activity -- were gainers. International Paper rose 5/8 to 58 3/4, and Westinghouse added 1 to 69 3/8.    The Dow Jones Transportation Average climbed 16.90 to 1526.32 as airline stocks, which tumbled Thursday amid worries about possible federal intervention in the industry's takeover boom, showed some renewed strength.    UAL, which owns United Airlines, accounted for most of the average's rise by surging 7 1/4 to 287. The company was expected to receive a leveraged buy-out offer from a group including the pilots union at United, UAL management and British Airways; according to The Wall Street Journal, the bid could exceed $300 a share.    Other airline issues to rebound included AMR, the owner of American Airlines, which went up 1 7/8 to 89 7/8; Southwest Airlines, up 1/2 to 29 1/4, and Alaska Air Group, up 1/4 to 28 7/8.    Johnson andamp; Johnson rose 1 1/8 to 53 1/2 on 1.3 million shares amid rumors that the company might receive an acquisition offer and that the Food and Drug Administration is nearing approval of one of its drugs. The company told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report it hasn't been approached by any would-be suitors and isn't aware of any imminent FDA approvals.    In addition, Dean Witter Reynolds repeated its buy recommendation on the stock and Shearson Lehman Hutton cited Johnson andamp; Johnson and United Technologies, which advanced 7/8 to 56 5/8, as attractive on a technical basis.    American Brands went up 1 7/8 to 79 1/4. Business Week magazine reported in its &quot;Inside Wall Street&quot; column on speculation that B.A.T Industries may merge with the company to defend against the $21.1 billion takeover offer from a group led by Sir James Goldsmith. B.A.T gained 1/8 to 13 1/8 on the American Stock Exchange.    Golden Nugget dropped 1 3/4 to 29 3/8. Chairman Stephen Wynn told PIR he isn't planning a leveraged buy-out, as has been rumored, and the company has no plans to continue buying back its stock at the current price level.    Niagara Mohawk Power went up 1/8 to 12 3/4 on 1.9 million shares, more than five times its average daily volume. The utility said it would omit its third-quarter dividend on common stock and implement a plan to cut costs. Separately, New York regulators allowed Niagara Mohawk to resume charging its customers for power costs related from an outage at the Nine Mile Point One nuclear plant. </TEXT></DOC>
