Gottschalk Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABORMUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN><TEXT>   Warren Knudson, an operations manager for Sparta Inc.'s office in Laguna Hills, Calif., has total freedom in managing his company-contributed profit-sharing fund.    This doesn't mean just the option -- as many large corporations offer -- to put profit-sharing funds in either a managed stock and bond fund or a guaranteed investment contract with an insurance company. Sparta, a Huntsville, Ala.-based defense and aerospace company, allows employees to buy and sell whatever investments they please.    In the six years he has been in the self-managed fund, Mr. Knudson has purchased a broad range of U.S. stocks, silver certificates, South African gold-mining stocks, international mutual funds and limited partnerships investing in office buildings in the Southwest. He has even taken out a loan from his fund to buy into a small company that builds golf courses.    Mr. Knudson and his company are on the cutting edge of a trend, as small businesses increasingly allow employees to manage their own profit-sharing money in special accounts at brokerage houses. For many employees, the plans are a welcome way to take control of their future financial well-being. For employers, it's a recruiting tool -- and a way to avoid fiduciary responsibility for managing employees' retirement funds.    &quot;My job is managing an engineering company -- not making prudent investments for the company's profit-sharing plan,&quot; says Robert J. Vickery, Sparta's executive vice president and a co-founder.    The trend, however, isn't likely to spread to the largest companies. Although these businesses are offering employees more alternatives with their profit-sharing and savings funds, they aren't interested in totally self-directed accounts. &quot;The cost and complexities are too great for a large corporation,&quot; says Walter Holan, president of the Profit Sharing Council of America, a Chicago-based trade group. &quot;The record-keeping would drive companies crazy.&quot;    Self-directed plans also have plenty of critics, who say that -- mishandled -- they can be invitations to disaster.    &quot;It's like letting a sick person loose in a drug store to pick his own medicine,&quot; says Roger C. Gibson, a partner with Allegheny Financial Group, a Pittsburgh, Pa., financial-planning concern. &quot;Left on their own, many people will get hammered in the short-run volatility of the stock market.&quot;    Budge Collins, a Newport Beach, Calif., pension-fund consultant, says he thinks self-management does employees &quot;a disservice because they compete against people who do this full time.&quot;    Even Mr. Knudson -- while crowing about the &quot;opportunity to diversify my retirement portfolio&quot; -- concedes the freedom hasn't paid off with a spectacular investment performance.    In the six years Mr. Knudson has been in Sparta's self-managed profit-sharing fund, he says his investments have averaged a return of at least 10% a year. The company says this is an average annual return for Sparta employees. Yet all mutual funds surveyed by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. averaged an annual return of 13.3% over the same time period.    Mr. Holan says that for self-management to work, the employees ought to have some kind of investment background. &quot;Otherwise, it takes tremendous education by the company, and then you wonder if the employee is paying more attention to the stock market than his job,&quot; he says.    Still, for smaller companies like Sparta or for doctors, accountants, lawyers, dentists and others, self-management has plenty of attractions. For one thing, says Mr. Vickery, it has been a &quot;very good recruiting tool.&quot; Sparta, a closely held concern of 300 scientists, engineers and office workers, &quot;attracts secure individualists who want total control of their profit-sharing money,&quot; he says.    Self-managed plans are also easy to administer for small companies, says Ron E. Meroli, vice president of CPI Pension Services Inc., Irvine, Calif. &quot;A doctor, for example, doesn't want the responsibility of managing his nurse and secretary's profit-sharing money,&quot; he says.    The new tax law is also spurring interest in self-management because new regulations and controls on defined benefit, or pension, plans make them more difficult for smaller concerns to administer, Mr. Meroli says. As a result, smaller companies are turning to defined-contribution retirement plans such as profit-sharing and 401(k)-savings plans instead of defined-benefit, or pension, plans.    At Sparta, a new employee is immediately vested in the profit-sharing program, and the company annually contributes 15% of the employee's salary to a so-called earmarked account at Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., Newport Beach, Calif. A pension consulting firm, PMZ Pension Corp., Santa Ana, Calif., administers the plan and Delaware Charter Guarantee andamp; Trust Co. Inc. is trustee, overseeing the kinds of investments that can be made. Sparta employees can also take out up to $50,000 in loans from their profit-sharing account.    Michael Schadegg, a Sparta engineer, likes the flexibility and control. &quot;You get more out of it than the traditional retirement plan,&quot; he says. &quot;You can take out a loan to buy a new car, and pay yourself back the interest. My friends who work at other companies just can't believe we have a plan like this.&quot;    Mr. Knudson, however, says he thinks the ability to use the profit-sharing money as a second source of funds is a drawback to the plan, even though he did take advantage of that ability. &quot;People think of it as a place to take out a loan instead of an estate-building mechanism,&quot; he says.    Mr. Schadegg says he aims for an average yearly return of about 10% and has met his goal over the long run. &quot;This is more exciting than having a professional money manager handle your money,&quot; he says. &quot;Without this option, a lot of us wouldn't have any spare money to invest.&quot; Mr. Schadegg currently has 25% of his money borrowed, 35% in the money-market fund and 40% in five over-the-counter stocks.    Jeanette Nelson, a personnel administrator, says she has made &quot;some good stock investments and some bad ones&quot; but she is happy with the plan. One experience illustrates a drawback of self-management: You have to watch your investments carefully.    Between July 1984 and January 1985, Ms. Nelson invested $3,500 in Westworld Community Health Care Systems, an over-the-counter stock, and the value of her investment climbed to $10,050 within about a year. Then she went on a vacation. When she returned, she says she discovered that the stock's price had plummeted and that she had a paper loss of &quot;thousands of dollars.&quot; She still holds her 600 shares of the stock, which have continued to drop in price. The shares are unlisted and today Ms. Nelson's stake is worth between $150 and $300.    Mr. Vickery says he realizes that some employees have taken their lumps on stocks that did badly. But he says, &quot;The best way to learn investing is the school of hard knocks -- preferably when you're young.&quot; He adds, &quot;I personally believe that people should learn to handle their money themselves instead of hoping that Big Daddy is always going to be there, looking out for them.&quot;    ---             PROFIT-SHARING OPTIONS       A survey of 812 major U.S. employers       found the following percentages of       investment options available to       employees in profit-sharing plans:               One option:            32%               Two options:           26%               Three options:         25%               Four options:          13%               More than four options: 4%   Source: Hewitt Associates, Lincolnshire, Ill.</TEXT></DOC>
