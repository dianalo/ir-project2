(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The biological father of a child cannotstake a claim to the infant if he failed to support its motherduring pregnancy, an attorney told the Florida Supreme Court Tuesdayin a custody case.   The court is being asked to decide if a man who virtually ignoredhis pregnant girlfriend after she refused to have an abortion canretain the right to challenge her decision to put the baby up foradoption.   ``The putative father knew from the very beginning that his womanwas pregnant,'' said attorney Chandler Muller, who represented theadoptive parents, known as Bob and Jane Doe in the case. ``He turnedhis back on the developing child.''   Muller said he hoped the court ``will have the courage to look atpre-birth abandonment.''   The youngster is called John Doe and his natural parents havebeen dubbed Richard and Mary Roe because of court-ordered anonymity.   John L. O'Donnell, Jr., attorney for the natural parents, whowere not married at the time of the boy's birth in September 1986,argued before the court that the natural father did everything thelaw allowed to assert his rights.   ``Our position has always been the statute allows considerationonly of post-birth activity,'' said O'Donnell. ``I'm not saying thisman was perfect, but this is not a man who turned his back andwalked away.''   The mother was encouraged by her rabbi and an attorney to givethe baby up for adoption after the father initially refused to marryher and urged her to have an abortion.   In July 1986, the mother moved from Phoenix to Winter Park, wherethe adoptive parents provided an apartment, paid her medicalexpenses and gave her $300 a month for expenses.   She spoke confidently of giving up the baby in talks with theadoptive parents' lawyer and a state social worker, saying thenatural father had abandoned her. She gave written consent for theadoption two days after the boy's birth.   The infant went home with his new parents Sept. 15, the same daythe father learned of the birth. Two days later, the fathercontacted an attorney to file papers acknowleding paternity, hopingto stop the adoption without his consent.   The couple reconciled and were married in November 1986, twomonths after the baby was born. The mother supports her husband'sfight for the infant's return.   In June 1987, a judge ruled against the father, saying he hadeffectively abandoned the child during the mother's pregnancy, butthe 5th District Court of Appeal reversed the ruling in March,saying it was necessary to have the consent of the biological father.   The appeals court left the adoptive parents with custody of theboy until the Supreme Court reviews the case.   The attorneys said they expected a decision could take anywherefrom a few weeks to several months.</TEXT></DOC>
