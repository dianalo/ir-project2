 According to Ron Blechner, brother ofjoint chairman David Blechner, Star's share price is unlikely to rise abovethe current 66 pence so long as Star isn't ripe for takeover, or pursues anunglamorous and steady path.andP;  He insists that a takeover is highly unlikelysince neither his sibling nor co-chairman Jack Schumann have any intention oftaking their 56% shareholding below 50%.andP;  That would undoubtedly make thecompany more attractive to sceptical City folk.andP;  The 17-year old company hasa chequered history, and despite what the ex-rock and roll promoter says,there is some justification for a degree of wariness and diffidence.andM;IdiosyncraticandM;A number of foolhardy acquisitions and idiosyncratic ventures have taintedthe company's reputation for financial acumen.andP;  Combine this with the City'sgeneral downer on technology, and Star's share value seems set to stay in thedoldrums for some time to come.andP;  Star was established in 1973 and acquiredHartley, its Australian-based competitor in the same year.andP;  By 1981 thecompany was ready for listing on the USM and achieved full listing thefollowing year, with the share price reaching an all-time high in December at325 pence.andP;  The first real problems to hit Star came with a change of productstrategy and the massive investment required to make the move to Unix.andP;  Thecompany weathered those difficulties, but bad acquisitions and investmentsled to an uneasy perception of Star in the financial world.andP;  It made itsfirst expensive mistake by acquiring Paxton for #500,000.andP;  Star had beenlooking at both Pegasus Plc and Paxton, and in view of Pegasus' success,obviously plumped for the wrong one.andP;  The majority holding was eventuallysold back to Paxton, and Blechner says that it was a costly lesson not toinvest in companies that don't have a proven track record and need to bedrastically improved.andP;  As a dictum it sounds perfectly sound, but it isn'tone that Star has assiduously followed.andP;  In March 1987, Star announced theacquisition of Orchard Management Services for #500,000 (CI No 643).andP;  Orchardwas turning over #2m per annum, with profits of #90,000.andP;  It's main productwas an MS-DOS-based package for accounts production and payroll, and seemedto complement Stars' traditional Tetra software and general commercialpackages.andP;  The acquisition also gave Star a 25% stake in Orchard Inc, a WestCoast company that was rewriting Orchard's products for the US market.andO;However, the acquisition fell through because the owner of Orchard got coldfeet, according to Blechner, and a marketing agreement was establishedinstead.andP;  The marketing rights were subsequently re-sold to Or-chard abouttwo years ago.andP;  Star also acquired a company called Connect Data, whichBlechner describes as the jewel in the crown.andP;  The company was established in1982 to supply and install computer cabling and fibre optics.andP;  A highlyprofitable concern, the acquisition, Star believes, was strategicallycorrect.andP;  The downside came when Connect Data made its own acquisition.andP;  Itbought GDC for #200,000, believing, says Blechner, that two plus two equalsfive.andP;  He also says that the lesson to be learned there is not to buy fromoutgoing management.andP;  Bad organisation within GDC was compounded when a keyfigure in the Connect Data-GDC relationship was involved in an accident andabsent from work for a long period.andM;By Janice McGinnandM;The effect of this acquisition was felt in October last year when Starreported a #933,000 loss on turnover of #14m.andP;  Since then there have beenradical changes within Connect Data.andP;  With a new management team at the helm,the company has been forced to cut costs and staff, and operations have beencentralised under one roof.andP;  Blechner insists that a return to profitabilityis on the cards, and the intial acquisition will be vindicated.andP;  In May 1986,Star appeared to go completely off the rails when it planned to float a newcompany specialising in waste-disposal.andP;  The Miniskip Group was alreadyoperating in Australia, and Star became interested via its Hartleysubsidiary.andP;  David Blechner believed he could raise #2.5m via the UnlistedSe-curities Market, conditional on the Stock Exchange Council giving its aye,and establish a Miniskip operation in the UK.andP;  However, there was a greatdeal of reluctance in the City to back such a scheme, later compounded byAntipodean problems.andP;  Blechner defends the venture and says that the idea wasbasically sound, if ahead of its time.andP;  On that catalogue of tragedy ithardly seems surprising that Star is not the City's favourite son.andP;  But, acombination of healthier acquisitions, restructuring, and the advice of MikeWhitaker of Singer Whitaker paints a more optimistic picture.andP;  Star's otheracquisitions over the past two years include the systems house PinnacleComputer Systems Ltd, Summit Computers Ltd with Summit Computer MaintenanceLtd, and United Health Systems.andP;  The first cost #40,000, and Summit cost#160,000 upfront with #150,000 over the next three years, according toperformance.andP;  United Health Systems was acquired in September 1989 for#25,000 upfront and a maximum of #150,000 over a three-year period.andP;  Pinnacleprovides computerised management and reporting systems.andP;  Its primary productis Service Manager which uses fourth generation language techniques, and9runs on Convergent, Arix, and Unisys machines.andP;  Blechner says that overseasmarkets are increasingly important, and he sees 1992 as an opportunity forPinnacle to expand its activities.andP;  The second acquisition, Summit Computersand Summit Maintenance, specialise in Data General look-alikes, and have nowbeen subsumed into the company's engineering division.andP;  They are alsoinvolved in the education sector where a number of establishments are usingthe Convocate conference booking system to augment revenues.andP;  The third,United Health Systems, was established in 1983 with a system designed forpathology laboratories.Since then it has developed systems for radiology andhospital administration.andP;  Recent government proposals to reform the NationalHealth Service have led to work with ICL and Bull on resource managementcontracts.andP;  Blechner forecasts that United Health Systems will be the nextPinnacle in the Star family.andM;Vicissitudes Consequently, the new-look Star Computer Group Plc is theholding company for six operations, all answerable to the main board.andP;  Theycomprise Star Computers Ltd, Pinnacle Computer Systems Ltd, Summit ComputersLtd, United Health Systems Ltd, Connect Data Ltd, and Star Computer ServicesLtd. Star Computers Ltd remains the group's core business and supplies Unixsystems based on Tetraplan and Chameleon software.andP;  The company alsodistributes Convergent Technology, now Unisys, machines.andP;  In October lastyear, Star attributed some of its losses to market uncertainty about thefuture of this equipment.andP;  There are suggestions that Star wants to get ridof its distribution business, but the company denies this.andP;  Blechner saysthat Unisys has committed itself to the range and the two companies have anamicable, ongoing relationship.andP;  Star Computer Services is the engineeringand disaster recovery subsidiary, and supports Convergent, Arix, DataGeneral, Micos, and ITG equipment.andP;  Blechner is confident that therestructuring will ensure Star returns to profitability, arguing that thecompany has grown from a single product business to a multiple group, despitea number of lean years and changing business cycles.andP;  He says the City iswrong to take a short term view of technology oriented industries, andmaintains that a firm in business for the best part of two decades, is likelyto survive the vicissitudes of City analysts.andP;  A view that many others wouldsecond.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
