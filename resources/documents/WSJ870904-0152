If only Gorbachev could be so fortunate. In Poland and Hungary, similar policies have only provoked rock bands to strain the limits of government tolerance.    In the early 1980s, Gen. Jaruselski used a liberal policy toward rock music in a bid to &quot;win the hearts and minds&quot; of Polish youths. He and his government won only insult. Punk groups proliferated and band names reflected the tenor of the times: Sewage, Plutonium Death, Destruction and Pathology of Pregnancy. The punk band Deserter toured Polish cities shredding the party newspaper and screaming &quot;Propaganda!&quot; Just last year, at a June Communist Youth Festival, the lead guitarist of the Polish supergroup Lady Pank appeared onstage shouting obscenities and exposing himself in front of 40,000 communist youths. He was thrown in jail.    Hungary, boasting the most liberal cultural policy in the Soviet bloc, has also found it necessary to muzzle its rockers. At a February 1983 concert, Hungarian punk bands dedicated a song to deceased Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, singing: &quot;The schemer has died, the beast has died, the dictator can now become an idol.&quot; Another song denounced Hungary's leadership as &quot;a rotten, stinking Communist gang,&quot; and asked, &quot;Why hasn't anyone hanged them yet?&quot; The concert brought wild cheers from the audience and prison sentences from the government.    But Gorbachev need not look to the Wild West of his socialist empire to realize the inherent dangers of rock 'n' roll. In the Soviet Baltic Republics where the cultural policy has generally been more open than in Russia proper, the governments have been battling renegade rock groups since the late 1970s. Roving gangs of Latvian punks have reportedly beaten up visitors from Moscow and displayed before Russian tourists banners declaring &quot;Latvian Punks Will Finish What the Germans Began,&quot; a reference to World War II when an estimated 20 million Soviet nationals died. A party secretary in Tallin warned: &quot;Our two greatest enemies are the Pershing missiles and Western music.&quot;    And what can Gorbachev expect from Russian rock musicians once &quot;glasnost&quot; has been plugged into the Soviet amplifier and electric guitar? Kremlin officials found out last January when several Central Committee members attended the annual opening concert of the Leningrad &quot;Rock Club.&quot; Mikhael Barzikhin, lead singer of the Leningrad group Televizor, which had been banned from the stage for six months in 1986, glared at the officials seated in the balcony and, in high decibel, sang: &quot;Looking up at the terrorists above, I say, Get out of control! Tear down these walls, Sing what you want, not what your told, Get out of control!&quot;    Prof. Timothy W. Ryback   History and Literature   Harvard University   Cambridge   ---   Mr. Fisher accurately noted the increasing popularity of underground rock, new wave and reggae in the Soviet Union. A look at Moscow radio and TV listings, however, makes it clear that the process of permitting Russians to hear popular music has a long way to go.    During a recent week, the only radio and television stations in Moscow (a total of three each) were virtually devoid of popular culture of any kind. On Wednesday, for example, the sole musical offering on TV Channel 1 was &quot;Concert by participants in the 'Bratislav Lyre' competition.&quot; Channel 2 had one hour of classical music and one hour of &quot;fragments from operas.&quot; The &quot;Moscow Channel&quot; featured just 15 minutes of Soviet folk songs.    Radio (sorry, AM only; no FM stereo) was equally barren of anything hip. For instance: between &quot;L.N. Tolstoy, 'War and Peace' -- chapters from the novel&quot; and &quot;Harvest Time&quot; was sandwiched a &quot;Concerto for oboe and orchestra.&quot; Later in the day, one could hear the &quot;Chamber Chorus of the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Culture.&quot;    My favorite, though, was scheduled for 10:10 p.m. on the Moscow Channel: &quot;The Exhibition and Demonstration Orchestra of the U.S.S.R. Internal Affairs Ministry's Internal Security Troops.&quot; Reminds one of that famous &quot;heavy metal&quot; Soviet group, the &quot;Rolling Tanks.&quot;    C.
