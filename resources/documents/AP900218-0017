He said he acquired themanuscripts last year.   The early pieces were discovered in Giggleswick, a Yorkshiretown the composer frequently visited. They include a trio forviolin, piano and cello, an arrangement of the Yorkshire ballad``Clapham Town End,'' and a setting of a poem.   ``Clapham Town End'' is a song about two dealers ``trying toflog a dead horse on the other _ or one a dead horse and the othera dying one,'' Mitchell said.   Elgar, who died in 1934, is known for his later compositionssuch as ``The Dream of Gerontius'' and ``Land of Hope and Glory.''</TEXT></DOC>
