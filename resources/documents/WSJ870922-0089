Sometimes, in the view of outsiders, it does its job too well. People who depend on census numbers and other government statistics say the integrity of these federal figures is being jeopardized by overzealous congressional response to localities trying to make the urban big time.    Here's the latest example: Decatur, Ala., wants in the worst way to be part of a metropolitan area. When you're on the government's metro-area list, wonderful things happen. Your name appears on countless population and income rankings. Advertisers take notice. Companies looking to open new plants heed your chamber of commerce brochures.    And the government, working on the theory that urban areas are inherently costly places to live, hands out more money to metro areas and gives them higher reimbursments for items such as medical care than it does to places without official metro status.    BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM for Decatur, a chemical manufacturing center in northern Alabama. It doesn't qualify for metro status on its own. In deciding what areas deserve the title &quot;metropolitan,&quot; the government takes a variety of factors into account, including city and suburban population, population density, and even commuting patterns between adjacent counties.    When Decatur combines its own Morgan County with Lawrence County next door, the metro definition almost fits. Rejigger the population density factor by omitting the 170 square miles in southern Lawrence County occupied by Bankhead National Forest, and the area qualifies. Solution: Ignore the forest when computing Decatur's metro-area formula.    Sorry, says the federal government's Office of Management and Budget, the arbiter of the metro-area list. You can't slice off pieces of a county to meet the rules, even if what's cut out is federal government land populated by trees, not people.    Frustrated by OMB, Decatur boosters appealed to their congressional delegation. On June 30, an innocuous, seven-line bill ordering OMB to declare Morgan and Lawrence counties a metropolitan statistical area, &quot;without regard to the portion of the Bankhead National Forest located within Lawrence County,&quot; was approved unanimously by the Senate on a voice vote. A similar bill is pending before a House committee.    IN THEIR END RUN around OMB, the Alabamians are following the large footsteps of Sen. Robert Dole, who performed the same service for some Kansas constituents last fall. Harvey County, Kan., had asked to be included in Wichita's metropolitan area. The impetus came from two county hospitals; they complained that their location over the metro-area border put them at a disadvantage with Wichita hospitals. Reimbursements for Medicare claims are higher inside than outside a metro area.    OMB refused, so Mr. Dole, the Senate Republican leader, engineered the change in Harvey County's status by attaching an amendment to the continuing budget resolution, the huge catch-all spending bill that Congress passed in October.    &quot;We were trying to please our constituents,&quot; admits Steve Coen, who runs Sen. Dole's Wichita office. He says Harvey County fit the metro-area formula so closely &quot;that we felt it was unfair they weren't included.&quot;    Fiddling with the definition of metropolitan areas isn't new. Joseph Duncan, chief economist for Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp., recalls President Nixon announcing a new set of metro-area definitions during the 1970 mid-term elections, partly because Long Island, N.Y., didn't qualify for metro status under the old rules. Mr. Duncan was OMB's chief metro-area watcher at the time.    BUT IT'S THE NEW TREND of creating metro areas by legislative fiat, outside the existing definition, that's driving data users nuts. Metropolitan areas are the geographic linchpin for analyzing the local economy. Metro statistics are the basis for tracking local unemployment and inflation trends. Retailers use these figures to determine the best new store sites.    &quot;When metro areas become politically instead of statistically defined, they have less and less value,&quot; says Mr. Duncan. &quot;The average local politican doesn't get that distinction.&quot;    &quot;It's a terrible breach of faith with the integrity of the statistical system,&quot; says William Hawkes, director of statistical research at A.C. Nielsen Co. in Northbrook, Ill. Congress overriding OMB on a technical definition sends a signal to local activists everywhere, Mr. Hawkes says. &quot;Once the precedent is set, it's open season for anyone else who has financial or prestige gains at stake.&quot;    If the proposed Alabama metro area is approved, &quot;The dam will be broken, and you'll see all sorts of junk going on,&quot; says Edward Spar, president of Market Statistics, a New York demographic consultant. &quot;I see the potential destruction of the metro-area concept,&quot; he adds.    The Alabamians, not surprisingly, see things differently. &quot;OMB has been rather obstinate to say the least,&quot; says Sen. Richard Shelby. &quot;They wouldn't listen to the obvious.&quot;    &quot;It'd be an economic plus for our area,&quot; adds Irvin Commander, executive director of the Decatur Chamber of Commerce. &quot;If nothing else, we'd be listed on the statistical reports. In many respects, we're not on the map now.&quot;    The debate continues in hearings scheduled for Oct. 13 before the House Subcommittee on Census and Population. </TEXT></DOC>
