Of those who foresaw another war, six in 10 expected it withintwo decades, the Media General-Associated Press poll found. And ifworld war does break out, 54 percent feared its escalation intoall-out nuclear war.   A majority of respondents also said one of the darkest episodesof World War II could recur: A holocaust on the order of NaziGermany's murders of more than 6 million Jews, gassed, starved orshot in concentration camps.   The poll, conducted among 1,163 adults, asked: ``Do you thinkthat kind of thing could happen again _ that is, the killing ofmillions of people because of their religion or ethnic background?''Six in 10 said it could.   World War II erupted on Sept. 1, 1939, when more than a millionGerman troops invaded Poland. The war soon consumed Europe, NorthAfrica and the Far East, claiming an estimated 50 million livesbefore it ended in 1945.   The United States joined the war in 1941 after the Japanese, whowere allied with the Germans, attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet atPearl Harbor, Hawaii. Poll respondents overwhelmingly expressed theview that the Nazis would have conquered Western Europe had theUnited States not intervened.   In the Pacific, the United States hastened Japan's surrender in1945 by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki _ still theonly time nuclear weapons have been detonated in a war.   Six in 10 poll respondents said the Hiroshima bombing, in whichdeath estimates run as high as 200,000, was the right thing to do.Seventy percent of the men in the survey supported the bombing; halfthe women agreed.   With Japan now one of the world's leading economic powers, nearlyfour in 10 said the United States did too much to help rebuild Japanafter the war. Two in 10 said they sometimes think of Japan as theenemy because of the war.   Germany fared better: Just one in 10 said they sometimes think ofit as the enemy, and 24 percent said the United States did too muchto help rebuild West Germany, also one of the world's strongesteconomies today.   Respondents strongly supported the reunification of Germany,which was divided into democratic West Germany and communist EastGermany after the war. Seventy percent favored reunification.   Nearly seven in 10 considered themselves to be familiar with theevents of World War II. Older people were far more apt to ratethemselves as ``very familiar'' with the war; 57 percent of thoseolder than 64 chose that category, compared with just 12 percent ofthose younger than 45.   There was no division by age in familiarity with one aspect ofthe war: A near-unanimous 95 percent said they had heard of theHolocaust.   Older respondents were less likely to believe there will beanother world war but were more likely to expect that if oneoccurred it would escalate into nuclear war. The expectation ofanother world war was greater among women than men, 53-44 percent,and women were more inclined to fear nuclear escalation of a worldwar, 60-48 percent.   Of the 49 percent who foresaw another world war, 6 percent saidit was likely within five years, 29 percent within 10 years and 26percent within 20 years. Thus 61 percent of this group _ or 30percent of all respondents _ expected World War III within twodecades.   The poll was conducted by telephone July 7-16 among a randomsample of adults in the continental United States. It has a marginof error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
