In a surprising change of policy, Northwest Airlines yesterday disclosed plans to ban smoking on all domestic routes -- plus a few international ones -- beginning April 23. The move to a smoke-free cabin, predicts a Northwest official, &quot;will prompt more non-smokers to try us than cause smokers to walk away from our airline.&quot;    That may be, but some airline executives say the Northwest strategy is risky. The only other airline to try a sweeping anti-smoking strategy was Muse Air, a Dallas carrier that Southwest Airlines bought in 1985. &quot;Muse Air never made a profit,&quot; says a Southwest spokeswoman. &quot;Certainly their no-smoking policy wasn't enough to attract increased business.&quot;    The Northwest ban goes beyond a new federal regulation, which takes effect the same day, prohibiting smoking on flights lasting two hours or less. More than 60% of Northwest's domestic revenue passenger miles involve flights of more than two hours. In addition to flights within the U.S., Northwest's ban affects all of its flights to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean; in total, the Northwest ban affects flights that carry some 100,000 passengers a day.    However, the airline won't subject some international passengers to the same policy -- in deference, it says, to &quot;foreign passengers who feel differently about the issue of no smoking.&quot; Northwest derives 30% of its passenger traffic from its extensive Pacific routes. The ban won't affect those flights or flights to Hawaii and Europe.    The impetus behind Northwest's bet that smokers would rather take its flights than switch was marketing research showing that more than 80% of passengers on the banned flights are non-smokers, and that even 30% of smokers prefer sitting in the non-smoking section of the airplane. Flight attendants also have long complained about the health risks of repeated exposure to smoky aircraft cabins.    What's more, Northwest, a unit of NWA Inc., says its research, which focused on frequent fliers, shows that non-smokers would select an airline they don't usually fly based on its no-smoking policy.    In some respects, Northwest may be in a better position than other airlines to experiment with a smoking ban. Its dominant position at hubs in Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis gives passengers few other options for travel.    At the same time, however, Northwest's recent service difficulties have given it a reputation for arrogance, and some passengers may see the smoking ban as further confirmation of the carrier's insensitivity. Until now, airlines have tried to tread a middle position in the smoking debate -- not wanting to offend either side.    &quot;We're upset a major airline has decided not to accommodate 30% of the flying public,&quot; says a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute. &quot;We can safely predict that smokers will look to other carriers that do want their business.&quot;    Northwest's move, however, was hailed by Rep. Richard Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who sponsored the federal smoking ban. Rep. Durbin says the public should demand that other airlines follow Northwest's lead.    So far, though, the other big carriers aren't jumping to match Northwest's move. &quot;We've done a number of surveys and (a smoking ban) isn't something well accepted by our passenger base,&quot; an American Airlines spokeswoman says. Says a spokeswoman for Eastern Airlines: &quot;It's the type of thing where you can't please everybody.&quot; Eastern, she adds, has &quot;no intention&quot; of going beyond the federal two-hour smoking ban.    But Northwest officials are so confident they will be proved right that they are instituting the ban the week before they begin service to three strongholds of the tobacco industry, Norfolk, Va., and Greenville and Spartanburg, S.C.    &quot;We're at the leading edge of what customers want,&quot; insists John Temple, Northwest's vice president for marketing programs. He adds that by simply prohibiting smoking on all domestic flights, Northwest will be able to avoid the confusion which is bound to surround enforcement of the two-hour smoking ban.    The federal law, for example, doesn't make clear what happens when a 1 1/2-hour flight turns into a three-hour flight because of a delay. &quot;At least Northwest passengers will know what they can expect on every flight,&quot; Mr. Temple says.    Northwest will refund the tickets of passengers who have received advance seat assignments in the smoking section for flights after April 23, provided they purchased their tickets before March 23. </TEXT></DOC>
