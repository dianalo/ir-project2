All started andwere greeted warmly by the crowd, which gave Wilson, a veteran of 14 seasonswith the Blackhawks, a two-minute standing ovation when he took the ice.;  &quot;It was nice to be back and see a lot of friends,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;I was asnervous for this game as for any I've ever been involved in. When I went onthe ice, I found myself looking around and having flashbacks.&quot;;   TheBlackhawks, who had the best record in the NHL last season, spurred Wilson'smemory by taking a 1-0 lead when Dirk Graham scored after only 1 minute, 55seconds had expired in the first period.;   And although Sharks left wingPerry Berezan answered with a goal 46 seconds later, the Sharks were never inthe game after Keith Brown, Greg Gilbert and Jeremy Roenick added first-periodgoals to give the Blackhawks a 4-1 lead at the first intermission.;   Roenickfinished with two goals, and the Blackhawks also got goals from Mike Hudsonand Steve Larmer. The Sharks got two goals from Steve Bozek to go along withthe one by Berezan.;   &quot;It would have been nice to come back here and win, butthey have a good team,&quot; Presley said. &quot;When they get on a roll, they're toughto stop.&quot;;   At least the Sharks don't have to feel alone. The Blackhawks havescored seven goals in three consecutive games.;   &quot;We've been able to generatean offensive explosion,&quot; Blackhawks Coach Mike Keenan said. &quot;And the nicestthing about it is that we're getting it from people other than just Roenick'sline. That's important to us because it makes the players feel like they canrely on other people.&quot;;   The game turned ugly at 4:32 of the second period,when skirmishes broke out all over the ice and referee Paul Stewart handed out34 minutes in penalties.;   The penalties included a game misconduct to Sharksgoalie Brian Hayward, who was ejected for leaving the crease to becomeinvolved in a fight between Roenick and Kevin Evans.;   Hayward jumped intothe fight after it appeared that Blackhawks defenseman Chris Chelios hadjoined Roenick to double-team Evans. Hayward was replaced by Jeff Hackett.;  &quot;This was a frustrating game for our players,&quot; Sharks Coach George Kingstonsaid. &quot;We got burned early, and nothing seemed to go right after that.&quot;;   Themost frustrating moment came at 16:49 of the second period, when the puckdeflected off Wilson's skate and went between Hackett's legs for a Chicagogoal. The goal, which was credited to Hudson, came while the Sharks had apower play, and it gave the Blackhawks a 5-1 lead.; San Jose   1  1  1 -- 3;Chicago    4  2  1 -- 7;      FIRST PERIOD -- 1, Chicago, Graham 1; (Thomas,Creighton), 1:55. 2, San Jose, Bere; zan 2 (Wilson, Lawton), 2:41. 3,Chicago,; Brown 1 (Hudson), 3:43. 4, Chicago, Gilbert 1; (Hudson, Brown),12:50. 5, Chicago, Roenick 3; (Smith, Larmer), 18:31 (pp).
