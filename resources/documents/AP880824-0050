Casualty reports continued to trickle in from remote parts ofthis Himalayan mountain kingdom as relief workers fanned outthrough the foothills and valleys. Sunday's pre-dawn quake strucknear the India-Nepal border.   Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that followed the quake.Others had cracks three feet deep or were blocked by boulders thesize of houses.   At least 549 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapaof the Home Affairs Ministry. Dharan was hardest hit. At least 131bodies were found in the city of 100,000.   Indian officials have maintained since Monday that the deathtoll in their country was 200 or less, but the figure wasquestioned by opposition politicians, survivors and the localmedia, including the Times of India, a newspaper that generallysupports the government.   They put the India death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500.   Indian officials said 200 people were injured in the quake.Nepalese officials listed 752 injured, down from their earlierestimate of 1,000.   In Bhaktapur, a city of 50,000 where seven people died in thequake, 63-year-old Nhuchhe Raj Sakya said his five-story brick andmud house had nearly fallen down but that he and his family of 10were still living in it.   ``What else can we do?'' the goldsmith said. ``We have no tent.How can I leave my place?''   Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan onTuesday and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once three-story andfive-story houses.   ``This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal,'' Shrestha saidas he toured the town.   Dharan, 105 miles southeast of Katmandu, sits on a rolling plainat the base of a steep hill. Most of the victims died in theirhouses, which were made of bricks held together by mud that hadloosened during the seasonal monsoon rains.   Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozers have demolishedmore than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation.   ``We will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied(the ones remaining) are safe to live in,'' he said.   Adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from thegovernment on compensation or new housing for people whose homeswere demolished. Most of the homeless have moved in with neighborsor found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth.   The earthquake, which struck when most people were still asleep,registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and was the deadliest quake inthe region since 1950, when a temblor in the east Indian state ofAssam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists'accounts.   Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's quake, and rumors ofan impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into thestreets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan.   The rumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread byword of mouth. In Dharan, men ran from houses to houses rousingpeople from their sleep.</TEXT></DOC>
