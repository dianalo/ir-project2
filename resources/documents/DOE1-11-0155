A published method for obtaining these magneticcoordinates, or more specifically the Fourier components of the magneticfield in this coordinate system, has existed for a vacuum magnetic field.A procedure for calculating these components for a finite-{beta} plasmaequilibrium, however, has not previously been available. (Here, {beta}is the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure.) In this report,we describe such a procedure, in which we start with an arbitrary-{beta}magnetic equilibrium for which nested toroidal flux surfaces exist andobtain the Fourier components of the magnetic field in straight-linemagnetic coordinates. We describe the various numerical procedures, referringto published documentation where needed. We then document the codes involvedand apply them to a specific toroidally nonsymmetric, finite-{beta} plasma.8 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
