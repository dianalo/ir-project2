This capability is needed to develop and test furnacecontrol algorithms since experimental determination is difficult andexpensive. Simulation incorporates parameters (including arc voltage,arc current, electrode gap and furnace pressure) from previous quasisteadyexperiments with 460 mm diameter Inconel 718 electrodes. Cathode heatingrates (determined by classical as well as experimental arc models) arelinked to these independent variables. After radiative loss adjustmentsto the heating, transient one dimensional melting is computed.</TEXT></DOC>
