OCR), and threethat are incapable of handling multiple columns at all (Carets Deluxe OCR, PCOCR Plus, and Advantex).andM;A number of other OCR products were not shipping at our review time butshould be available by the time you read this.andP;  The most notable of these isthe PC version of Accutext, a high-end, 386-only OCR package from XeroxImaging Systems.andP;  There's also CAT Reader Professional from Computer AidedTechnology, ReadStar 6 from Inovatic, and the OCR component of the integratedscanning software Image-In.andP;  Finally, Hewlett-Packard will be offeringAccuScan, OCR software based on Calera Recognition Systems' technology, as a$595 option with its ScanJet Plus page scanner.andM;WHERE IT ALL BEGINSandM;All of these products use industry-standard desktop scanners as a way ofgetting documents into the system.andP;  The growth of desktop publishing hascreated an environment conducive to growth in the OCR market as well; it hassupplied a large installed base of relatively inexpensive 300-dot-per-inchscanners, and these offer enough resolution for accurate recognition of themost-common typefaces and sizes.andP;  We tested with the market-leadingHewlett-Packard ScanJet Plus, but most packages support units from Canon,Microtek, and Panasonic, and all accept TIFF files from other scanners.andP;  Mostof these scanners offer automatic document feeders as an option for easierscanning of long documents.andM;Performing OCR with a standard page scanner is a matter of expedience ratherthan optimization.andP;  While 300-dpi resolution works fine for most fonts largerthan eight points, for smaller type sizes the result is an excessive numberof joined characters, since the scanner can't always find that single line ofwhite pixels separating two characters.andP;  For very small typefaces (fourthrough eight points) and thin characters, you really need a 400-dpi orhigher model.andP;  These are not exorbitant in cost-Panasonic's FX-RS307U, forinstance, lists for $1,599 (plus $299 for the interface).andP;  But not all OCRsoftware supports these higher resolutions and the extra data they require.andM;Resolution is only one of the issues.andP;  Custom OCR scanners are also optimizedfor contrast and have special paper-feeding and alignment options forproduction use, to minimize the possibilities of distortion.andP;  Though theycost less, standard page scanners put a greater burden on the recognitionsoftware to compensate for their lesser-quality scans.andM;A SCANNER IN THE HANDandM;What about hand scanners? The low cost of these products make them of greatinterest to a wide range of users, and several of the OCR packages in ourreview have hand-scanner versions.andP;  While 400-dpi hand scanners are abundant,and software such as Logitech's CatchWord supports this resolution, you havegood reason to be cautious.andP;  Getting a scan straight enough for OCR can bedifficult, and any OCR software used with them must be fine-tuned to handleexcessively skewed characters.andP;  Further-more, scanning full-sized pages, evenwith packages that can join several scans together before recognition, istime-consuming.andP;  Users who combine low-cost OCR software with the variabilityof hand-scanned input are sure to emerge from the experience frustrated anddisappointed.andM;Moreover, developments in the hand-scanner category threaten to make thisissue obsolete.andP;  By the time you read this, Caere should have shipped PCTypist, a $595 hand scanner with OmniPage's smarts built into it.andP;  It willallow you to scan, recognize, and place text into any application in a singlepass.andP;  And by the end of this year Mouse Systems will be releasing PageBrush,a $795 PC version of its Macintosh-based hand scanner that uses absoluterather than relative position tracking, thus eliminating the skewing problem.andO;Such innovations should make it possible to use ordinary OCR softwarereliably without shelling out for a full-page scanner.andM;SLOW LEARNERSandM;Even assuming the best of all possible scans, not all OCR software is createdequal.andP;  Some software performs far better than others, and the hardwarerequirements vary depending on the recognition methods each package uses.andM;Trainable software is the older, more-familiar type.andP;  These packagestypically use a pattern-matching recognition algorithm (also known as matrixor template matching), in which the image of a character is compared to theknown images of the letters, numbers, and symbols in a given typeface.andO;During a typical training session, the software displays the image of eachcharacter and you type the letter to which it corresponds.andP;  The result is afont image file that can be saved for use with other pages with the same kindof type.andM;Though simple in concept, trainable packages have serious drawbacks inpractice.andP;  The initial training process is tedious and time-consuming.andP;  Inmost cases, you must train each size of each typeface separately, and evenwhen the package comes with pretrained fonts, recognition can be stymied byslight variations in type style.andP;  Though some trainable packages use variousmethods of shortening the training cycle (such as interpolating a font tablefrom a different size of the same typeface, or from a similar typeface),these innovations don't always work very well.andM;JACK OF ALL FONTSandM;Not surprisingly, the better packages rely on so-called &quot;omnifont&quot;technology, which uses feature extraction (also known as topologicalrecognition or intelligent character recognition) to discern lettersindependently of their specific shapes.andP;  In this scheme, the system breaksdown each character into its constituent parts (lines, curves, angles,ascenders, and descenders) and compares the result with its database ofcharacter information.andP;  This is a way of looking at character results in anearly unlimited font vocabulary for the package.andM;Omnifont technology produces far-more-accurate results with less work andtedium than trainable packages, and omnifont packages are better at readingmulticolumn documents with graphics as well.andP;  They generally (though notalways) command higher prices, but the cost differential between omnifont andtrainable packages is negligible in view of the performance differences.andP;  Andthe accuracy of omnifont software on oddball fonts can be bolstered byincorporating trainability as a supplementary option, as in Ocron's Perceive.andO;In the future, purely trainable packages will probably be relegated to theniche market for excessively stylized and archaic typefaces.andM;WHAT CAN GO WRONGandM;OCR algorithms have made great strides in accuracy, but no system is perfecteven on simple text.andP;  Predicting and compensating for character errors is animportant issue when you're choosing between packages.andP;  Most packages tend tomake more of some types of errors than others, so keep this in mind as youread through the reviews.andP;  For instance, if you want to use the recognizedtext as part of a text database, extra spaces between words and wrongpunctuation aren't terribly important, whereas if you're publishing the sameresults in a desktop-published newsletter, removing the extra spaces andpunctuation errors might be a real pain.andM;Some of the elements of type design that make text easier on the eye and moreattractive to read can befuddle omnifont and trainable packages alike.andP;  Tightkerning and ligatures are always problematic, especially for trainablepackages, which use rectangular outlines to separate characters.andP;  Andfractures such as those in degraded photocopies can cause single charactersto be interpreted as two or three.andP;  Dot-matrix print poses a related problem,since the dots that make up the letters often don't touch.andP;  However, sincethis type of print forms regular patterns, OCR software such as WordScan Plusand Caere's OmniDraft add-in for OmniPage incorporate a connect-the-dotscapability to compensate.andM;Underlining is a universal challenge for OCR software, which has problemsdisentangling descenders from underlines, turning ys into vs and commas intoperiods.andP;  And environmental influences, such as stray marks and coffeestains, can cause the software to erroneously interpret marks as characters.andM;TO ERR IS INEVITABLEandM;When the software isn't sure of a character's identity, it may flag thecharacter as unknown or it might make a guess as to what the character islikely to be.andP;  Some OCR packages (such as WordScan Plus) incorporatelexicons, built-in dictionaries that check the spelling (and make a stab atthe context) of a word before making a decision about it.andM;But most OCR output error-checking occurs after the fact.andP;  The most-commonproofreading tool is the spell-checker in your word processing software.andO;Unfortunately, such spell checkers won't catch errors like punctuation marksinserted in the middle of words, misrecognized punctuation marks,substitution errors that result in real words, or spacing errors, althoughgrammar checkers can make an attempt at correcting these problems.andP;  Some OCRpackages, such as Caere's OmniSpell add-in for OmniPage/386, performspell-checking especially attuned to OCR-related errors; for instance, sincec is often substituted for an e, if cerie were the error, the program mightsuggest eerie as an alternative.andM;Some errors simply take time to correct.andP;  Scanning numeric information, forinstance, requires great care, because every character is critical, and itcan't be spell-checked mechanically.andP;  Though we did not explicitly testnumeric recognition, the more-accurate packages should do a fine job ofreading numbers, and some even offer a &quot;numbers only&quot; mode to improve yourchances even further.andP;  But you still have to proofread and double-check thefigures.andP;  Getting the results into a usable worksheet file can also be a bittricky; many packages can save the file into a .WK1 format, but they don'talways accurately space the columns, throwing off the cell addresses andmaking the entire worksheet worthless.andM;Other things are simply impossible with today's technology.andP;  Many peoplewould love a package to scan in the contents of forms for data-entry use, forinstance.andP;  But recognition algorithms can't differentiate between the textand the box surrounding it in any useful way.andP;  And there's still no accurateway to recognize handwritten form entries.andM;A HUNGER FOR POWERandM;OCR is now far more accessible than it once was, but it isn't exactly cheap.andO;You'll need at least a 286-based system with lots of free disk space, andunless your documents are relatively simple, count on a fast 386 system with2MB to 4MB of RAM.andP;  And, of course, a page scanner, preferably with anautomatic document feeder, is a necessity.andP;  OCR work will eat up your entiremachine, unless you get a coprocessor card to allow background processing.andO;Still, many offices have comparable equipment now, and the remainingcomponents are widely available at competitive prices.andM;For more-demanding applications, technological developments have thepotential to improve OCR even further.andP;  RISC technology, for instance, canboost horsepower for more-complex and effective recognition algorithms, andhas already been implemented in such high-end systems as Xerox ImagingSystems' Kurzweil K-5200, which, for $19,950, combines a combinationsheet-fed and flatbed OCR scanner with a RISC-based coprocessor card.andO;Parallel processing shows even more promise.andP;  Caere's new Parallel Reader, a386SX-based turnkey system that sells for $10,095, comes with no less thanfour Motorola 68020 processors.andP;  Working together, they let the systemcontinue to scan pages while others are being decomposed and recognized,improving the throughput of the system.andM;Faster and more-powerful CPUs and wider buses will eventually make PC-basedOCR accurate and speedy enough to make it truly attractive to a wider marketof office users.andP;  In the long run, the ability to take an image of a documentand turn it into working text should be an innate function of mostsophisticated word-processing applications.andP;  But you needn't wait until thetechnology fully matures; today's OCR systems offer-practical benefits today.andM;OCR SOFTWARE: SUITABILITY TO TASKandM;Our suitability-to-task scores are informed subjective ratings for varioustasks to help you decide what's right for your application.andP;  For a completepicture of what each product offers, compare these ratings with the reviews,the features table, and the performance tests.andM;Each OCR program is rated according to its overall suitability for threetypes of documents.andM;Monospaced Text is a measure of the product's overall ability to scan-intypewritten or computer-printed office documents.andP;  An adequate score meansthat the product produces good results on regular-size monospaced fonts, suchas the Courier typeface produced by laser printers and typewriters, withoutlengthy training.andP;  Good performance on small fonts, the ability to handlelandscape and underlined text, and the ability to read dot matrix output arealso important factors in the overall score.andM;Proportional Text rates the product's suitability for handling laser-printedoffice documents in ordinary proportional fonts.andP;  An adequate score means thepackage offers good performance on typical serif (Times Roman) and sans serif(Helvetica) proportional fonts.andP;  The ability to read landscape text, tohandle boldface and underlining, and to handle multiple fonts per page andretain character enhancements are also important considerations.andM;Complex Documents is a measure of the package's ability to handle multicolumndocuments printed in a variety of fonts and weights.andP;  An adequate scoreindicates the ability to handle multicolumn text, either through definingregions or through templates, while ignoring graphics and other extraneousportions of the page.andP;  The ability to decompose the page automatically, toignore or save graphics separately, and to retain the format of the originaldocument via stylesheets are pluses.andM;*  OmniPage/386andM;* WordScan Plus The results of our OCR software tests show wide swings inperformance, from near-perfect to almost-useless.andP;  But the best packages comeup to a remarkably high standard.andM;Our Editor's Choice goes to WordScan Plus from Calera Recognition Systems andCaere's OmniPage/386, which came in neck-and-neck on the most importantmeasure of OCR ability: accuracy.andP;  The design of Calera's brand-new $995product comes closest to the ideal of hands-off recognition.andP;  It handlespages of any format, and although its heavy-duty algorithms cost a bit interms of speed, its deferred processing capabilities make this relativelyunimportant; you can simply put your documents in the scanner and walk awayuntil they're finished.andP;  If you really need a speed boost and have the moneyto pay for it, you can get a coprocessor-based version for $3,995.andM;OmniPage/386 from Caere ($895) rates a close second to Calera's product infeatures, but more importantly, it has that killer combination of speed andaccuracy.andP;  If raw speed is your primary goal, it may be your preferredchoice.andP;  And an upcoming Microsoft Windows 3.0 version definitely bearswatching.andM;Finally, an honorable mention goes to ReadRight.andP;  Challenging the adage &quot;youget what you pay for,&quot; ReadRight succeeds in holding its own on most ordinarydocuments, while running on a 640K PC and costing only $495.andP;  It doesn'thandle complex documents as easily as its more expensive competitors, but ifyou don't need these capabilities, it can be all excellent choice.andM;DIFFERENT STROKES: Handwriting Recognition on PCsandM;The problems facing systems that recognize handwriting are unique andseparate from those confronting OCR.andP;  Handwriting is quite different fromtypewritten or printed text.andP;  Type is composed of static characters withuniform shapes and predictable spacing, but handwritten characters offerlittle uniformity in either shape or spacing, making recognition a differentgame altogether.andP;  However, a computer has an advantage over OCR because itcan &quot;watch&quot; the handwritten letters take shape.andP;  For this reason handwritingrecognition on PCs is no longer an elusive goal.andM;By substituting a pad and stylus for a keyboard, computers can use strokesequence analysis to detect characters as they take shape.andP;  The direction andorder by which each line segment is formed adds information that the computercan match to known patterns.andM;The Sony Palmtop and Canon Ai Note are products (sold only in Japan) that usea handwriting interface to recognize a number of the thousands of differentcharacters used in handwritten Japanese.andP;  Since the Japanese schoolsconsistently teach a single set of penmanship skills, the stroke sequencematching method yields highly reliable results.andP;  American handwriting is notso consistent, however.andP;  As a result, most designs that handle Englishhandwriting are limited to capital letters in block printing only.andP;  There isnothing in the technology that prevents the use of lowercase letters, exceptthat there is so little uniformity in the way people write them.andP;  However,within the next year more products that add lowercase recognition areexpected to appear on the market.andM;Many systems rely on sophisticated pattern-matching algorithms, often basedon the same concepts used in designing neural network computers.andP;  The SonyPalm top uses &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; to identify characters.andP;  Though this technologycan make products somewhat more accurate, you must still write each characterin a separate box so that letters do not touch.andP;  And you'll still need tolearn how to write so the system can understand you, rather than the otherway around.andP;  And you thought that you left penmanship lessons behind in thethird grade !andP;  SPECIAL PURPOSESandM;Not surprisingly, most of the handwriting recognition systems available todayare aimed at very particular tasks, such as field data collection.andP;  Perhapsthe best known in this class is the GRiD Pad from GRID Systems Corp. (asubsidiary of Tandy Corp.) of Fremont, California.andP;  The GRiDPad is a4.5-pound notebook computer, which you use a stylus to write (in blockcapital letters) on a 5-inch LCD screen.andP;  The company provides C and Clipperlibraries so that you can write your own applications.andM;The Scriptwriter from Data Entry Systems in Huntsville, Alabama, is a kind ofintelligent clipboard on which you enter data by filling in the blanks on apaper form.andP;  The data is stored in an ASCII file that you can dump into yourPC for processing.andP;  The Hand-writer from Communications Intelligence Corp.,andO;located in Menlo Park, California, is a digitizing tablet that you hook toyour PC.andP;  It sends recognized characters to your computer as if they wereentered on a keyboard, so you can use it with most popular applications.andM;The Go Corp. of Foster City, California, is reported to be working on a newgeneration of laptop computers that can recognize handwriting.andP;  And IBMresearchers have already demonstrated their &quot;Paperlike Interface&quot; that willsupposedly recognize letters that touch, and will even handle cursive script.andM;The degree to which this technology can be applied to the more-complicatedtask of recognizing handwriting on paper is an open question.andP;  But if youlong for a simple ballpoint pen and a stack of foolscap in place of yourkeyboard, your wait may soon be over.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
