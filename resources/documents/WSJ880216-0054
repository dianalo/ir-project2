Of course there also are broader national issues at stake. But how could anybody enjoy eight years of effective leadership by, say, Sen. Robert Dole, knowing that at the end of that time his wife, Elizabeth, was likely to write a memoir?    Mrs. Dole apparently was scarred as a child. As described in the joint autobiography, &quot;The Doles: Unlimited Partners&quot; (with Richard Norton Smith; Simon andamp; Schuster, 272 pages, $19.95) -- No, they didn't borrow the subtitle from the Village Voice personal classifieds -- she entered Salisbury, N.C.'s annual fire-prevention essay contest sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. She won. Her prose reflects the tastes of contest judges. &quot;As a break from my corporate law classes (at Harvard),&quot; she writes, &quot;I liked nothing better than courses in Russian and Chinese law, international codes, diplomatic statutes.&quot;    Mr. Dole's sections are much smoother. Read with George Bush's autobiography, &quot;Looking Forward&quot; (with Vic Gold; Doubleday, 270 pages, $18.95), though, it becomes clear that both he and the vice president shared the same childhood.    The Doles were a family that enjoyed the simple pleasures. They'd take part in the horseshoe contests at the Happy Hollow, down on the banks of the Saline River. On July 4, Papa Dole would bring home a big chunk of ice and a case of pop, and the kids would sit around the front porch watching Dad set off fireworks. Once Papa Dole's alarm clock went off accidentally in the middle of the night and he groggily sent young Bob off to get some milk. Bob ran down to the grocery store and obediently waited in the darkness, until his father came and fetched him.    The Bushes were more affluent but apparently just as down-home. &quot;Dad taught us about duty and service. Mother taught us about dealing with life on a personal basis, relating to other people.&quot; Childhood was a long, golden summer spent off the Maine coast. &quot;Grandfather believed in the straight-and-simple method of fishing. Just a basic green line wrapped around a wooden rack with cloth from an old shirt or handkerchief used as lure.&quot;    &quot;You're talking about yourself too much,&quot; Mr. Bush's mother once told him after reading reports of one of his campaign speeches.    Their idealized childhoods are appealing, but accounts of World War II highlight their books. Interestingly, while Mr. Bush's account of combat is most gripping, Mr. Dole is most compelling when describing his long recuperation.    Pat Robertson, meanwhile, emphasizes his pre-Born Again carousing, as is the habit of many evangelicals. To this reader, though, it is the post-seminary sections of John B. Donovan's &quot;Pat Robertson: The Authorized Biography&quot; (Macmillan, 214 pages, $14.95) that raise eyebrows. Once, while his wife was off in Ohio nursing her sick brother, Mr. Robertson came across the passage in Luke, &quot;Sell all that ye have, and give alms.&quot; His wife called home one evening but found the phone disconnected. Mr. Robertson had sold it, and the furniture. He'd also given away their money.    Michael Dukakis never did anything so impetuous, and it's hard to get an image of his childhood because he doesn't seem to have had one. He was class president in third grade, a hallway monitor later on, and apparently not a child given to idle chatter. He seems to have decided at birth to be governor of Massachusetts. Since Mr. Dukakis committed himself to public service, he has not misstepped once or indulged himself in a moment's deviation from that goal.    He has, however, enjoyed one of the advantages of being a Democrat. Journalists have written his self-promotion for him. Charles Kenny and Robert L. Turner of the Boston Globe are responsible for &quot;Dukakis: An American Odyssey&quot; (Houghton Mifflin, 248 pages, $16.95), and Richard Gaines of the Boston Phoenix and Michael Segal have produced &quot;Dukakis and the Reform Impulse&quot; (Quinlan, 247 pages, $17.95). These books are like campaign bios, except more fawning.    Mr. Dukakis emerges from these two bubble baths as a man who reads nothing but policy papers. Indeed, his own campaign book, &quot;Creating the Future&quot; (Summit, 192 pages, $17.95), is a dry treatise on how he micromanaged the &quot;Massachusetts Miracle.&quot; Sections of the book are written by Harvard Business School's Rosabeth Moss Kanter, who seems to think Mr. Dukakis is overqualified to be pope. </TEXT></DOC>
