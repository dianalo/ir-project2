These twotechniques have been applied to problems that are both difficult andimportant, such as designing semiconductor layouts, controlling factories,and making communication networks cheaper, to name a few. Both techniquesare modeled on processes found in nature-natural evolution and thermodynamics-andboth are being used in AI systems that model aspects of human cognition,such as signal analysis, language processing and induction among others.The authors of these papers convey the challenging ways in which thesetechnologies are developing, and illustrate the wide variety of problemsto which they are being applied.</TEXT></DOC>
