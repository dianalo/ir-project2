The resignations appeared to be concessions to the mutineers andpose military and political problems for President Raul Alfonsin ashis party campaigns for May 14 presidential elections.   Alfonsin made no immediate public comment, but was expected toaccept the resignations of Lt. Gen. Jose Dante Caridi, the armycommander, and Gens. Miguel Abbate and Enrique Bianchi.   Caridi met with Alfonsin for 1{ hours before announcing hisdecision, the state news agency TELAM said in a terse statement onthe resignations. It gave no reasons or details for the resignations.   Alfonsin is to address the Argentine Congress on Wednesday in aspecial session focusing the Dec. 1-4 military insurrection, thethird uprising in 20 months.   Rebels led by army Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin demanded all thetop generals go, an increased military budget including bigger paypackets, and an end to the prosecution of officers for human rightsabuses committed during the 1976-83 military regime.   On Dec. 3, Alfonsin ordered the army to ``suffocate'' therebellion. The next day, he announced the mutineers surrenderedunconditionally.   But political opponents noted at the time that loyal troops werereluctant to fight the rebels, that the rebels were not immediatelydisarmed and that most mutineers were allowed to return to theirunits.   The opposition accused Alfonsin or Caridi of cutting a deal withthe rebels.   Alfonsin denied making any deal. Nevertheless, a 20 percent payincrease was granted to soldiers along with a $100 bonus.   On Saturday, Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena said in a speechthat the so-called ``dirty war'' against leftist subversion in thelate 1970s was necessary _ effectively endorsing the army's positionand infuriating human rights groups.   While the army did fight pitched battles with People'sRevolutionary Army guerrillas, the ``dirty war'' takes its name fromthe arrests, disappearances and presumed killings of severalthousand civilians alleged to be subversives.   Caridi was Alfonsin's fourth army chief in five years. Hispredecessor, Gen. Hector Rios Erenu, departed after the firstinsurrection in April 1987, which also was sparked by the humanrights trials.   The selection of Caridi's successor is delicate. Choosing an opensupporter of Seineldin, the rebel leader, would damage Alfonsin'scredibility and the civilian government's claim that the military issubordinate to it.   Already, presidential candidate Carlos Menem of the oppositionPeronist Party has said he would have fired Caridi for making a dealwith the rebels.   Caridi may have paved the way for his departure by saying in atelevision interview last Friday that the insurrection ended when heand Seineldin spoke and ``realized that our aspirations coincided.''   ``And so the question: why confront one another to producebloodshed if what they (rebels) were asking, the army was trying toachieve,'' Caridi said.   He added that if rebels' demands were not met, there might soonbe a fourth insurrection.   Argentina's two main political parties repeatedly have said theywould not allow Congress to pass amnesty legislation to halt thehuman rights trials, which are about to resume in civilian courtafter a year's lapse.</TEXT></DOC>
