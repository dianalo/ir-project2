As of Monday, Letterman was expecting to come back without hiswriters, though the show's producers were still trying to work outa guild waiver that would allow the writing staff to work, too.   ``Late Night'' head writer Steve O'Donnell stressed last weekthat whether or not they were at work, Letterman was going on theair with the writers' blessings and in no way was trying todisadvantage the guild, of which Letterman is himself a member.   ``We've been having meetings all week and we've decided the bestthing is to get the show on the air,'' O'Donnell said.   Johnny Carson, host of NBC's ``Tonight Show,'' returned to theair last month with Carson writing his own monologue.   Letterman is not violating the strike as long as he writes hisown material, which he will do if his writers aren't allowed backto work. Guests confirmed for Tuesday night's show include BillyCrystal, Susan Sarandon, Graham Parker and Los Angeles Lakers coachPat Reilly.</TEXT></DOC>
