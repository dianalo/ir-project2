Carel Boshoff, leader of the Afrikaner Freedom Movement, outlineddetails of the proposed nation Thursday that he said would includethe Atlantic coastline starting about 60 miles north of Cape Townand extend 300 miles inland. The area contains no major cities, andmuch of it is desert.   Boshoff's as-yet-nameless nation also would include the southernhalf of Namibia, but that South African-ruled territory is due togain independence by early next year.   His proposal contrasts sharply with the demand of a nationwideextremist group, the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, for creation ofa whites-only state consisting of Transvaal and the Orange FreeState, two of South Africa's four provinces. Both provinces havevast farming areas and numerous gold mines, and Transvaal includesthe major cities of Pretoria and Johannesburg.   Boshoff is a theologian and a former chairman of the Broederbond,a secretive society of influential Afrikaners. He is the son-in-lawof the late Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, who designed SouthAfrica's apartheid system in the 1950s.   Boshoff's proposal represents a reversal of the ideology ofVerwoerd, who sought to relocate blacks in nominally independentrural homelands while whites controlled the bulk of the country,including the industrial centers, gold mines, ports and bestfarmland.   Boshoff contends establishment of a small, whites-only nation isthe only way of ensuring the survival of the Afrikaners, the mainlyDutch-descended whites who make up about 60 percent of SouthAfrica's 5 million whites.   In a controversial policy document last year, Boshoff saidAfrikaners should abandon hope of dominating the entire country,where the 26 million blacks outnumber whites more than 5-to-1.   ``Minority domination as currently practiced in South Africa ismorally unjustifiable,'' he wrote.   The National Party government rejects the idea of a whitehomeland. It is struggling to find support for its concept of racialpower-sharing, in which blacks would be brought into centralgovernment but would not be allowed to overrule white interests.   Boshoff said he envisioned a transitional period in whichAfrikaners would move to the proposed white nation while it remainedunder South African control. He said infrastructure would beimproved with government grants similar to those extended to blackhomelands.   Boshoff acknowledged the area is dry, but suggested that theregion along the Orange River, which forms the South Africa-Namibiaborder, could be developed for agriculture.   ``A move to the area would change the lifestyle of people as theyknow it now, but they have a choice of staying in the fat of SouthAfrica and melting away or move toward a new beginning,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
