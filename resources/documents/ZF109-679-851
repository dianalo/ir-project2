 From the initial letter ofagreement to delivery of the final modules of a system and final payment,written documents not only establish you as a serious professional worthy ofyour pay, but provide an excellent mechanism for avoiding directconfrontations with clients.andM;Confrontations will occur; but to maintain control of the project, you mustavoid those encounters that, in essence, degenerate to a contest of wills.andO;Even though you might win such a battle, you'll lessen your image ofprofessionalism.andP;  It's easy to diffuse such situations and enforce theperception of professionalism by simply stating, &quot;My memory isn't perfect.andO;Let me go back and check the documentation thoroughly and get back to you inwriting.&quot;andM;The letter of agreementandM;and retainerandM;A letter of agreement and a retainer should be the first steps in anyproject.andP;  Payment of a retainer is a direct statement that the client hasretained you for the project and intends to proceed.andP;  It also assures theclient that you've accepted responsibility for completion of the job underthe general terms set forth in the letter and will make the necessary timeavailable for the project.andM;The client should return a signed copy of the letter along with the retainercheck.andP;  This is the first and most vital step in effective client managementbecause it establishes you as a professional in the eyes of the client.andM;Some clients may balk at paying a retainer, even though it's a standard inthe industry.andP;  When providing a letter of agreement, you can explain that itprotects the client, since you're committing yourself to the completion oftheir project and clearly stating an overview of what you'll provide--inwriting.andP;  The client can hold you to the terms of this letter; without such aletter, you could conceivably elect to pull out of the project if a morelucrative client appears.andM;You can further explain that your firm has finite resources; in order toallocate those resources to effectively meet client needs, you must beassured that they're serious about proceeding.andP;  In essence, you're beingasked to provide a substantial commitment of your resources towards theclient and must, therefore, request that the client also provide evidence oftheir commitment.andP;  The inference, of course, is that other clients arewaiting in the wings (to provide a retainer); if this potential client isn'twilling to do so, then you must move on.andM;Letters of agreement take many forms, depending on the project at hand, thetype of work to be done, and whether the work is to be done on a fixed-priceor time-and-effort basis, or a combination of the two.andP;  There's no &quot;right&quot;way to phrase such letters and every consultant does this differently.andO;Letters of agreement should, of course, always include information about theconditions under which the agreement may be canceled.andP;  A sample letter isshown in Fig.andP;  1.andM;Written specifications andandM;change ordersandM;It's imperative that written specifications be developed for every system,even for those simple ones that can be done quickly.andP;  Why?andP;  In terms ofclient management, written specs are important because they provide a basisfor putting forth a professional image to clients and for diffusing potentialconfrontations.andM;There are two basic types of specs.andP;  Functional specifications generally dealwith the functionality of a system and don't include as many details as you'dput into the technical specification.andP;  When you're managing small, simpleprojects, functional specs will probably suffice.andM;In theory, a client should be the one to develop functional specs, but inpractice I've yet to find a client capable of doing this adequately.andP;  Ofcourse, clients don't have the expertise to develop detailed technicalspecifications, so these must be completed by the consultant.andP;  Both typesrequire close client and consultant cooperation, and the client shouldapprove the final specifications by signing off on them.andP;  Fig.andP;  2 shows partof a functional spec letter for a simple system.andM;You should understand that written specifications simply provide a vehiclefor effective communication with the client.andP;  Both functional and detailedtechnical specifications should be reviewed and discussed with clients on anitem-by-item basis.andM;Since there's no way of knowing in advance how long it will take to developspecifications, perform such services on a time-and-effort basis.andP;  Charge theclient either hourly or daily for this work.andP;  The client then owns the specsand can use them the request bids from others.andP;  I also use the specs as thebasis for the fixed price I provide to the client for the actual creation ofthe system.andP;  I've never had a client elect to use another consultant onceI've completed work on specifications, but I've had clients decide not toproceed with the system once they realized the costs.andM;Some clients may balk at the added costs in preparing even functionalspecifications.andP;  My approach is to explain that without such specs, there'sno way to ensure that all the features they want in their system will beincluded, nor is there anything upon which I can provide them with a fixedcost for the project.andP;  If a client still declines to pay, I bow out of theproject.andM;Once detailed technical specs have been completed, I use a Lotus 1-2-3spreadsheet (in Fig.andP;  3) to estimate time and price for a project.andP;  Then Isend a cover letter that includes a revised version of the spreadsheet andthe fixed cost of the project, as well as a list of other items that need tobe noted.andP;  I discuss the letter with the client, then have them sign andreturn a copy to indicate their acceptance.andP;  The letter specifically statesthat work will commence upon receipt of the retainer.andM;Once I get the retainer, I modify the Lotus spreadsheet to include deliverydates for modules of the system.andP;  I also include time allocations andspecific dates for the client's acceptance testing and additional &quot;milestone&quot;payments.andP;  I review a copy of this with the client and place particularemphasis on their acceptance of testing responsibilities.andM;As work progresses on the project and I deliver each module, I also send anacceptance testing release.andP;  In theory, the client should sign and return theform on completion of each test; often this isn't the case.andP;  Typically, Isend a follow-up letter to the client several days after each acceptance testshould have been completed reminding the client of the deadlines and statingthat in the absence of a written document to the contrary from the client, itis assumed acceptance testing has been successfully completed.andM;I coincide payment schedules with delivery of each module of the system.andO;This provides the client with a control mechanism, since they'll only bepaying for delivered work; it further provides an incentive for theconsultant to deliver on time.andP;  This method, of course, also means you won'thave to chase clients for large payments after the fact.andM;You can use the documentation you've developed as a way to diffuse potentialconflicts regarding changes, client perceptions of bugs, and otherdifferences of opinions, while still maintaining control of the project.andO;Clients often forget to mention items they want included in a system orexactly how they'd like certain features to work.andP;  Furthermore, they'll oftenneglect to mention little things that they take for granted and simply assume&quot;everyone&quot; knows about.andP;  If you confront a client about whether or not theyspecified such items, you'll inevitably lose.andM;When I make a mistake or omit an item covered in the specs, I let the clientknow that, of course, there'll be no additional charge to correct the matter.andO;If the item wasn't clearly delineated in the specifications, however, I senda change-order letter (shown in Fig.andP;  4), which states that a review of thespecs didn't cover anything for the item in question.andP;  The letter alsoprovides the additional cost to make the change or modification and the extratime required for such a change.andP;  Remember to note the change in deliverydates as well.andM;You should ask the client to authorize or approve the changes, added costs,and additional time by signing and returning a copy of the change-orderletter.andP;  Discuss these changes with the client as well.andP;  This permits them tomake decisions about how important any particular modification might be interms of cost and time.andP;  I've often been surprised by the changes clientsauthorize as opposed to those they elect to forego once presented with suchdecisions.andP;  What's significant, however, is that approaching the problem in aprofessional manner avoids confrontation and requires the client to takeresponsibility for decision-making and the associated consequences.andM;If the client does elect to proceed with changes or modifications, I sendthem a revised copy of the Lotus spreadsheet.andP;  This clearly delineates thechanges in the calendar delivery dates for various modules and changes inpayments required at those times.andP;  And it's helpful in preventingmisunderstandings that might otherwise arise.andM;Once all the above have been put in writing, the most important aspect inmanaging the client is to follow through continually and consistently.andP;  Thisincludes sticking to your guns when you deliver a new module of a system.andP;  Ifthe client doesn't have the check available at that time, don't leave the newmodule installed on their system.andP;  Ask them to coordinate payment--or offerto do it yourself--and return to install the new module when the check isactually ready.andP;  And follow through with any necessary paperwork thatdescribes changes in delivery and client acceptance dates resulting from suchdelays.andP;  (You'll usually find that's the last time payment will be delayed.)andM;Most important, if a client doesn't pay on a time, inform them politely butfirmly that you must reprioritize your efforts towards those clients who havepaid early.andP;  Don't keep working for clients who don't pay!andP;  On the otherhand, make sure you live up to your part of the agreement and deliver work onschedule.andP;  This is the last step in ensuring that you've done your best tomanage clients properly.andM;Pat Adams is the president of DB Unlimited, an independent consulting firm inBrooklyn, New York.andP;
