Members of theHouse of Deputies, the lay-clergy branch of the church's bicamerallegislature, on Tuesday considered the compromise resolution, drafted in theHouse of Bishops, which approved it Monday. The compromise states that &quot;sexualexpression is appropriate only&quot; within legal marriage but acknowledges a&quot;discontinuity&quot; between that position and the lifestyles of many churchmembers.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  General News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GAY PRIEST RULING EXPECTED TO BE OK'D  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  National News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910717  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  30E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  92  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 17, 199100199028,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
