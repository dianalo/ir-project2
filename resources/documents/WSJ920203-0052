That'sbecause their exports are running at record levels, and theirsingle largest export market is Japan.   Chemical export surpluses have been one of the few brightspots in the U.S. trade picture the past few years. They hita record $19.5 billion last year -- exceeding America's totalagricultural export surplus. And that figure is expected totop $20 billion this year, nearly three times the chemicalindustry's export surplus as recently as 1985, despite theuncertain economic outlook for many industrialized countries.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. chemical exports totaled $43.5 billion last year, andimports reached $24 billion.   &quot;We think of ourselves as the Rodney Dangerfields of U.S.export industries,&quot; says Allen Lenz, chief economist for theChemical Manufacturers Association, a Washington, D.C., tradegroup. &quot;We don't get any respect.&quot;   Driving the chemical export boom is a host of factors:low-cost raw materials, highly efficient world-scale plants,a long history of direct investment in foreign countries anda more lucrative product mix increasingly based on specialtychemicals. A decline in the value of the dollar in the lasthalf of the 1980s also made U.S. chemicals cheaper on worldmarkets.   &quot;The chemical industry is a good role model for what U.S.industry has to do to be competitive in world markets,&quot; saysDexter Baker, chairman and chief executive officer of AirProducts andamp; Chemicals Inc., Allentown, Pa.   While hardly an unbiased observer, Mr. Baker is alsochairman of the National Association of Manufacturers and, inthat position, traveled with Mr. Bush on his recent Asiantour. &quot;In that capacity I do represent car makers, so I haveto be careful what I say,&quot; he says, with a laugh. Notsurprisingly, Mr. Baker wasn't tapped by the Bushadministration as a spokesman for U.S. industry during thatill-fated tour.   Despite the record export surplus, though, there areseveral clouds on the chemical industry horizon. Most of thememanate from South Korea, where several petrochemical plantshave been completed recently or are under construction. Asthey come on-line, they are expected to satisfy much of theanticipated increase in demand among Asian countries over thenext few years.   Other Asian countries -- including Taiwan, Singapore,Indonesia and Malaysia -- also are building or planning newchemical plants. For instance, Korea's and other Asiancountries' production of ethylene, a plastics building block,is expected to jump to 16 million metric tons by 1995 from10.6 million metric tons in 1990, according to Chem SystemsInc., a consulting firm based in Tarrytown, N.Y.   Compounding the threatened overcapacity are severalpetrochemical plants that U.S. companies built during thepast few years, figuring that rising Asian demand would soakup the added supply. &quot;Those additional Asian plants are goingto be a problem,&quot; concedes W.H. Clark, the domestic chemicalindustry's top trade adviser to the administration. He alsois chairman and chief executive officer of Nalco ChemicalCo., Naperville, Ill.   Still, he notes that when previous capacity gluts emerged,manufacturers often canceled plans to build new facilities.And he maintains that world economic growth will be able tosoak up the added supply after a few years.   Japan lags behind major chemical-exporting countries. Itran a net chemical trade deficit with the U.S. last year of$2.4 billion, or 12% of the U.S.'s total chemical tradesurplus. (But in total exports, Japan's surplus with the U.S.last year edged up 1.3% to $38.45 billion.) Working againstJapanese chemical companies are relatively high feedstockcosts because Japan imports all its petroleum products fromthe Mideast.   Japan's chemical industry also has tended to buildrelatively small plants to serve individual keiretsu, orindustry groups, such as the auto and steel industries andtheir suppliers. That trend helped boost production in thoseindustries and fostered their exports. But it has keptJapanese chemical companies from getting the economies ofscale that would make their products more competitive onworld markets.   Japanese chemical companies did make a few foreignacquisitions in the late 1980s as demand for manypetrochemicals outstripped world supply and pricesskyrocketed. But they've pulled back from foreign marketsrecently as the sharp rise in global capacity depressedprices for many petrochemicals by 50% or more from their1988-1989 highs. Japanese chemical companies may make furtherinroads in foreign markets in coming years, especially inEurope, as their auto and other export-oriented industriescontinue to expand there.   U.S. petrochemical plants are typically built near cheapenergy sources, the natural gas fields and pipelines near theGulf of Mexico. And that gives U.S. chemical companies costadvantages not only over Japan, but also over most Europeancountries, which also rely on petroleum derivatives.   Cheap energy, cheap land and easy access to deep-waterocean ports prompted the U.S. chemical industry to builddozens of huge, world-class petrochemical plants since WorldWar II. The economies of scale wrung from these mega-plantshave made it much cheaper for many foreign users to importfrom the U.S. than to build their own chemical facilities.Indeed, much of the plant construction under way or plannedin the Far East isn't driven by price as much as it is bythose nations' concerns that they develop a domesticpetrochemical industry for longer-term strategic reasons.   America's chemical industry has had an internationalaccent almost from its start. Du Pont, Solvay and Staufferare just some of the European transplants that helped buildthe U.S. chemical business. And some of their first customerswere foreign. E.I. du Pont de Nemours started makinggunpowder on the banks of Delaware's Brandywine River in1802, and three years later he was exporting powder to theSpanish government.   Today, about 40% of U.S. chemical exports are shipped tocompany affiliates overseas. There the affiliatesincreasingly are taking the shipments and producinghigher-cost specialty chemicals and plastics -- fromherbicides to plastics and composites, tailored to theirspecific market.   Partly reflecting this, the U.S. chemical industry hasbeen getting more bang for its buck investing overseas thanforeign chemical companies have by investing in the U.S.Foreign direct investments in the U.S. chemical industryexceeded U.S. direct investment in foreign chemical companiesby about 20% ($46 billion vs. $36.2 billion) in 1989. ButU.S. earnings from direct foreign investments, includinglicensing fees and other charges, exceeded foreign-companyearnings in the U.S. by $5.1 billion, according to theChemical Manufacturers Association.   The U.S. chemical industry can't afford to rest on itslaurels. Even though the U.S. runs a $1.65 billion exportsurplus with the 12 European Community countries as a group,Europe's leading economic powers are still net exporters tothe U.S. Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Franceall run hefty export surpluses with the U.S. Their strengthsin specific product lines, Germany's historic dominance ofthe organic dye industry for example, continue to make themstrong competitors.</TEXT></DOC>
