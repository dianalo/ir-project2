Even privileged Communist Party members, some of them worldrenowned figures in the sports, musical and theater worlds, havejoined the chorus.   Many of them risk jeopardizing the special status they enjoy iftheir criticisms get too loud.   Still, authors, entertainers, artists and sports personalitieshave urged the hard-line leadership to re-examine its policies andopen a dialogue with opposition groups.   The calls have ranged from a joint appeal by as many as 300 EastBerlin artists to individual statements by such prominent authorsas Christa Wolf.   Katarina Witt, the two-time Olympic figure skating gold medalistand possibly the best-known East German abroad, said the Communistgovernment must think about the causes for the exodus of its peopleto the West.   About 50,000 East Germans have fled West in recent months,either crossing Hungary's recently opened border to Austria orafter seeking refuge in Bonn's embassies in Prague, Czechoslovakia,and Warsaw, Poland.   The exodus deeply embarrassed the government last weekend during40th anniversary festivities that were overshadowed by nationwidedemonstrations unseen since Soviet tanks crushed a workers'uprising in 1953.   ``It makes me sad, it hurts me that so many people have left thecountry,'' Ms. Witt told reporters in Munich, West Germany, whereshe was touring this week with a show.   ``Something will change (in East Germany),'' said Ms. Witt,herself a member of the Communist Party and a beneficiary of theperks bestowed on major athletic stars.   Ms. Witt has been a glamorous ambassador of goodwill andpreviously limited her political statments to praise for thebenefits of a socialist system.   The brutal force used by security police against demonstratorsover the weekend caused some public figures to call for restraint.   Christa Wolf, a well-known author who is widely read in WestGermany, urged both sides to show ``prudence, calm and patience.''   In a statement broadcast by West German radio stations, shecriticized Communist authorities for outlawing the New Forumopposition group, calling the move a ``fatal'' mistake.   The author, whose daughter and son-in-law were arrested duringweekend demonstrations in East Berlin, called for a broad dialogueover the future of the country.   Kurt Masur, chief director of the famed Leipzig Gewandhauseorchestra, and cabaret star Berndt Lutz Lange joined three localCommunist Party officials in calling for a dialogue between theopposition and authorities.   After their statement was read on Leipzig radio about 70,000people demonstrated in the city Monday evening. Unlike the weekendclashes, the biggest demonstration in the current wave of protestsended peacefully with no intervention from massive security forces.   Actors in two East Berlin theaters have posted statementscalling for dialogue between the state and the opposition.   A similar statement was read by the cast in the Dresden CityTheater after a recent performance. After authorities warned theactors not to read the statement again, they stood silently on thestage after the next performance and distributed it to the public.   A group of 300 East Berlin painters, sculptors and other artistshave passed a resolution calling for a broad public discussion ofthe country's problems. They also urged the state-controlled mediato open up to all forces seeking democratic reforms.   A statement by 44 entertainers, including well-known East Germanrock bands such as Pankow and City, criticized the ``unbearableignorance'' of the Communist leadership.   The statement, published in a West Berlin newspaper, called forreforms ``that will not remove socialism but continue to make itpossible'' in East Germany.   Hermann Kant, president of the official Writers Union and amember of the Communist Party Central Committee, wrote an openletter to the Junge Welt newspaper criticizing censorship in themedia.   The letter, published on Monday by the official youth newspaper,said it would be wrong to abscribe ``our current defeat'' to the``evil class enemy.''   East Germany's state-run newspapers have bitterly denouncedWestern, particularly West German media, blaming them fortriggering the exodus and instigating the protests.</TEXT></DOC>
