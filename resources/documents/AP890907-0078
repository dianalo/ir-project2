At least one rocket landed in Jordan, officials of the Arabcountry said. It was the second attack in a week and the fifth thisyear across the normally quiet border.   Israeli soldiers watched the Soviet-made Katyusha rockets sailedinto the sky shortly after midnight, and found the remains of one107mm rocket in searches this morning, the military command said ina communique.   The blasts roused Israelis from sleep at a nearby kibbutz, orcollective farm. The only damage was a crater in the Jordan RiverValley.   Jordan's official news agency said one rocket landed near theborder village of Adasiyya.   In keeping with Israeli army policy, military sources declined tobe more specific about where the rockets landed in the Jewish state.   Israel's border with Jordan has been a quiet frontier for years,but several recent incidents have broken the calm.   Israeli officials said a Palestinian guerrilla crossed the borderSaturday and killed two Israeli soldiers before he was shot todeath. Jordan said it could find no evidence of a crossing.   Another Israeli trooper was killed in a March 18 infiltrationalong the southern border claimed by Fatah-Uprising, a Syrian-basedPalestinian group outside the Palestine Liberation Organization.Jordan said it arrested several people involved in that raid.   The Israelis killed two Jordanian soldiers in two other bordercrossings this year in the north and south of the country. Jordansaid the two had deserted their posts.   Neither Jordan nor Israel use Katyusha rockets, but somePalestinian guerrilla factions do. Jordan does not permit guerrillaattacks across its borders into Israel, and it expelled Palestinianguerrillas in a 1970-71 civil war, sharply reducing such attempts.</TEXT></DOC>
