In a motion for dismissal filed in a federal court, the Helmsleys alleged that the offices of Rudolph Giuliani, Manhattan U.S. attorney, and Robert Abrams, state attorney general, engaged in &quot;a pattern of prejudicial leaks and comments.&quot; The Helmsleys also argued that the pattern continued even after a state judge called for an investigation of alleged leaks in the case.    Harry Helmsley, 78 years old, and his wife Leona, 67, were indicted by federal and state grand juries last April for allegedly failing to report as income about $4 million between 1982 and 1986. The Helmsleys have denied the charges.    Leaking grand jury information is a violation of federal rules of criminal procedure and can be punished with a jail term. However, it's a tough charge to prove, and judges have declined to dismiss indictments even when leaking information has been proved, legal specialists say. &quot;Usually the judge slaps the government on the wrist and warns them not to do it again,&quot; one attorney said.    Even a wrist slap could be embarrassing for the high-profile Mr. Giuliani. He recently has been calling for the ouster of Paul Gentile, Bronx County district attorney, whom Mr. Giuliani says has disclosed information based on confidential Federal Bureau of Investigation files that are damaging to a political opponent of Mr. Gentile. Mr. Gentile has denied misusing FBI files.    A spokesman for Mr. Abrams said: &quot;I am not aware of any illegal leaks from this office regarding the Helmsleys.&quot; He said any information about the case that was divulged by his office wasn't covered by grand jury secrecy rules.    An aide to Mr. Giuliani, declined to comment.    The Helmsleys' motion alleges several instances of leaks by prosecutors to newspapers, mainly the New York Post. The motion said David Fishlow, a spokesman for Mr. Abrams, was quoted in the New York Post in December 1986 as saying &quot;numerous informants had come forward&quot; with allegations about the Helmsleys.    Officials of the New York Post couldn't be reached for comment.    The Helmsleys also alleged that earlier this month, James DeVita, an assistant U.S. attorney, &quot;announced to the press and the public in open court that a grand jury would be asked to investigate allegations that the Helmsleys made personal use of a corporate aircraft.&quot;    The Helmsleys noted that Mr. DeVita's reported remark occurred after a state court judge called for an investigation of leaks.    At the Helmsleys' arraignment last April, Justice Carol Berkman said: &quot;It would appear that someone, I don't know who, is giving out information which should not be disclosed and that there is a good possibility that a crime has been committed. . . . So I think it is very important that this be investigated.&quot;    A spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney said the matter had been referred to Charles Hynes, a special state prosecutor. A spokesman for Mr. Hynes said he &quot;couldn't confirm or deny&quot; that the office is investigating leaks in the case. </TEXT></DOC>
