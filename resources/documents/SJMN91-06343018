So she boughta self-help book: Dr. G. Alvaro de la Blanc's best-selling &quot;Blow Your OwnHorn: A Guide to Self-Assertiveness.&quot;;   She had a soft little voice: De laBlanc taught her to speak resonantly from her diaphragm. He exhorted her to bea Triple-A Person: Aggressive, Assertive and Annoying.;   The book worked sowell that she mustered the courage to tell off her boss, who had been treatingher like a piece of furniture for years.;   While job hunting she beganreading Dr. Wolf Krauthammer's &quot;Howl for Happiness.&quot; Krauthammer taught thatthe birth trauma made us all neurotic and that we must be reborn.;   Madgefollowed Krauthammer's exercises, lying naked on a blanket and screaming atthe top of her lungs (the &quot;Primal Howl&quot;).;   This enabled her to get in touchwith her true feelings of outrage at leaving a nice cozy womb. After a fewdays her neighbors called the police.;   After finding a new apartment Madgespent a lot of time feeling sorry for herself. She went on junk-food bingesand gained 25 pounds.;   She began to feel unhappy with her self-image untilshe read Robert Sorghum's &quot;All I Want to Be Is What I Was in Kindergarten,&quot;which said there is a fat child in all of us crying to get out and to go forit.;   She felt good about herself again, but then she read Jane Body's&quot;Cholesterol Countdown&quot; which told her that with her cholesterol count she hada life expectancy of 35.6 years.;   She immediately went out and bought allthe latest diet books: &quot;The Carrot Diet,&quot; &quot;The Baguette and Perrier Diet,&quot;&quot;The Westchester County Diet&quot; and &quot;The Bangladesh Diet.&quot;;   Meanwhile, Donaldwas spinning his wheels in a junior executive slot at a large corporation. Atthe age of 28 he looked in the mirror and saw a failure. So he he determinedto go into business for himself and chose real estate.;   He read &quot;WinningThrough Bullying&quot; by Rob Ringworm and &quot;Buying Country Property Could Be theSmartest Investment You Ever Made&quot; by David Harum. But the bottom fell out ofthe real-estate market and he lost a bundle.;   To recoup, he went into thestock market, reading &quot;How to Make a Fortune in Junk Bonds&quot; by Michael Milkitand The &quot;Art of Leveraging&quot; by Ivan Trump. But the junk-bond market collapsedand Donald was indicted in an Sandamp;L scandal.;   Spiritual awakening;   He spentsix months in a federal prison applying &quot;Different Strokes: How to Play KillerTennis&quot; by Vita Gastritis.;   Spiritually awakened by his 100 hours ofcommunity service, Donald became interested in the teachings of Swami RanjipurAssam, whose book &quot;Horizontal Meditation (HM)&quot; had persuaded thousands ofoverstressed American business executives to lie in bed and chant theirpersonal mantras 2,700 times, while taking deep breaths.;   Inspired by JimFoxx's &quot;Run Away From a Heart Attack,&quot; he ran 25 miles every day. For sex, helooked at Dr. Alex Lustgarden's &quot;Who's on Top? A Pictorial Guide to SuccessfulSex.&quot; But none of this brought him happiness.;   One day, pushing a shoppingcart full of books to the checkout counter at his local mall, he realized hehad become addicted to self-help books.;   As though they were telepathicallyattuned, Madge had decided exactly the same thing.;   And both of them saw thesame ad in the Personals Section of their local alternative paper:;  &quot;Self-Help Addicts Anonymous Meets Every Thursday at 7 p.m. in Room 302 at theNew School for Single Professionals.&quot;;   The next Thursday both of them showedup. Madge got up and confessed that she went from diet to diet and panacea topanacea and nothing changed, although she had lost 5 pounds.;   Donaldconfessed he had followed so much conflicting advice that he no longer knewwhat to do and had become a compulsive meditator.;   The group leaderrecommended they buy his book, &quot;How to Kick the Self-Help Book Habit.&quot;;  After the meeting Donald asked Madge out for coffee. They talked for hours anddiscovered they had a lot in common.;   Six months later they were married.They moved out of the city into one of the old houses Donald had purchasedduring his real-estate phase and consulted &quot;How to Fix Up an Old House&quot; inrestoring it.;   After a year their marriage started falling apart and one dayDonald found stashed in Madge's closet a number of books on how to obtain adivorce.;   The final exit;   So, feeling depressed, Donald brought home&quot;Self-Exit: The Ultimate Way to Peace of Mind,&quot; which had broken all previoussales records for a suicide how-to book.;   It included a Quality of LifeQuiz, which determined whether or not your life was worth living.;   WhenMadge saw the book she looked at Donald and he looked at her.;   &quot;Madge,&quot; saidDonald quietly. &quot;I think it's time.&quot;;   &quot;Yes, Donald,&quot; said Madge. &quot;It'stime.&quot;;   And so they collected all their self-help books in a great pile inthe backyard and burned them. All except &quot;Self-Cremation: How to Save on YourOwn Funeral,&quot; that is.;   And then they lived happily ever after.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RICHARD LINGEMAN  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911208  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1P  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  938  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 8, 199100343018,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
