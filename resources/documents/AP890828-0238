The increase was marginal compared with the 45 rigs added to thecount the previous week. That increase was due partly to areasdrying out from the heavy rains brought on by Hurricane Chantalseveral weeks ago, Baker Hughes officials said.   A year ago, the count stood at 935, the company said Monday.   Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations andeconomist for Baker Hughes, said more drilling has been predictedfor the second half of the year.   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index ofdrilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploringfor oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producingoil.   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company thatmerged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kepttrack of the rig count since 1940.   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig countreached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in therig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes begancompiling figures.   Texas, which accounted for more than half of the 45-rig increase,was the big loser this time, with its count dropping by 14.   Among other major oil producing states, Oklahoma's countincreased by six and Wyoming's was up by three. California, NewMexico, North Dakota and Michigan each gained two more rigs.   Kansas lost three rigs, Louisiana lost two and Ohio's count wasdown one.</TEXT></DOC>
