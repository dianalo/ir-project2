Though this trade restrictioneffectively dates back to 1817, a recent proposal by theNordic countries to include shipping restrictions under theproposed GATT Services Code has sparked hope of abolishingthis costly burden on American consumers. (The Bushadministration, the world's premier free-trade theoreticians,opposes the Nordic proposal).   Shipping has long been one of America's leakiestindustries. In the year the Jones Act was enacted, it costtwice as much to build a ship in the U.S. as in Britain. By1959, American shipping costs were seven times higher thansome competitors'. The Congressional Budget Office reportedin 1984 that American shipyards charged three times the priceof Japanese and Korean yards and were slower in delivery.Naturally, the less competitive a U.S. industry, the morevigilant Congress is to dragoon customers for it.</LP><TEXT>   Since Congress has given U.S.-flag ships a captive market,congressmen feel entitled to force American shippers to hireAmerican workers, and strong unions guarantee exorbitantsalaries. U.S. ship crews cost six times more than ThirdWorld crews; American shipmasters routinely cost shippingcompanies $300,000 a year. The high pay breeds corruption: AnFBI sting operation recently discovered that shipping jobsare illegally being sold by one maritime union.   A recent U.S. International Trade Commission studyconcluded that abolishing the Jones Act would save consumersas much as $10.5 billion as a result of lower shipping costs,while U.S. maritime operators would lose only $630 million inprofits. Thus, the Jones Act could be costing consumers $17for every $1 of domestic shippers' profits. Federal MaritimeCommissioner Rob Quartel, who is championing the repeal ofthe Jones Act, estimates that the total savings from repealcould actually be $20 billion or more, as the ITC estimatedid not include the costs of shipping restrictions on GreatLakes trade, forgone tax revenue, indirect effects on smallerindustries, etc.   The Jones Act, by making water-borne transport far moreexpensive that it otherwise would be, partially nullifies thebenefits of the Panama Canal for transporting goods fromcoast to coast. This makes it more difficult for Pennsylvaniasteel producers to compete against Japanese steel inCalifornia, or for West Coast lumber to compete with Canadianproducts in the eastern U.S. The ITC estimated that Jones Actrestrictions destroyed over 2,000 jobs in agriculture,forestry, mining, and other industries.   Sean Connaughton of the American Petroleum Institutenotes, &quot;We are seeing more and more oil imports in theNortheast, and imports have driven out a lot of the previouscoastwise oil trade from the Gulf Coast. The Jones Act is avery significant factor in this.&quot; U.S. oil shippers cannotcompete with foreign tankers with far lower operating costs.According to the General Accounting Office, the Jones Actrestrictions on oil shipping helped cause a serious shortageof heating fuels on the East Coast during a severe cold snapin December 1989.   Americans also have minimal opportunities to traveldomestically on passenger ships, largely because of thePassenger Services Act of 1886, a Jones Act equivalent forthe passenger cruise industry. In a free market, foreigncruise ships would offer pleasure trips from New York toBaltimore, Savannah, and Miami, and from San Diego to SanFrancisco. But cruise ships are prohibitively expensivebecause of federal buy-American and crew-American mandates.Seattle is especially victimized, as each year, hundreds ofthousands of tourists fly to Seattle for cruises to Alaska --but then cross over to Vancouver, Canada, in order to catchthe cruise ships. Mark Sullivan of the Port of Seattleestimates that the restrictions cost Seattle a minimum of $30million a year in lost tourist business.   Shipping protectionism has been extended to dozens oftypes of boats over the years, including Hovercraft, sewersludge carriers, and dredging ships. The Customs Service haseven banned whitewater tour companies from using foreign-madeinflatable rubber rafts on American rivers.   The Jones Act is often defended as providing a reservefleet for military emergencies. But Commissioner Quartelnotes that of the 400 ships used in Desert Shield by theMilitary Sealift Command, only one ship subsidized by theJones Act was used. (Jones Act ships tend to be too old or ofthe wrong type to aid a war effort).   The Jones Act is supposed to stimulate U.S. shipbuilding.But, as New York shipping consultant Michael McCarthyobserves, &quot;There is only one commercial ship being built inthe United States today -- a fairly small container ship, atabout twice the price of what it would cost to build abroad.&quot;Thomas Crowley, chairman of Crowley Maritime Corp., believesthat the performance of American shipyards has been ruinedlargely by their reliance on government contracts: &quot;Anyshipyard that does Navy work isn't worth a damn forcommercial work.&quot;   Though the Bush administration is demanding that foreigngovernments end their shipbuilding subsidies, it refuses torecognize the implicit subsidy the Jones Act provides to U.S.shipyards. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Linn Williamsdeclared last February that the act does not amount to a&quot;hill of beans in terms of subsidies&quot; and is a &quot;commerciallymeaningless program&quot; because so few commercial ships havebeen built in the U.S. in recent years. But, as the AmericanPetroleum Institute's Mr. Connaughton observes, &quot;That's kindof like saying that because we have destroyed an industry,let's make sure it never arises again.&quot;   The Jones Act engenders a chain reaction of extortion --allowing American shipyards to charge stratospheric prices toAmerican ship buyers, allowing American-flag ships to chargeshakedown shipping rates to American businesses, and allowingAmerican congressmen to demand lavish campaign contributionsfrom the American maritime industry (more than $1 million ayear).   U.S. maritime lobbies have been so generous that three ofthe past five chairmen of the House Merchant MarineSubcommittee have been indicted for criminal links to themaritime industry, as Congressional Quarterly reported. (Afourth chairman was indicted for other reasons.) Former Rep.Thomas Ashley declared that the House Merchant MarineCommittee &quot;sucks from the taxpayer; it sucks from anythingthat isn't nailed down.&quot;   While the Jones Act fleet is relatively small and old,there are 300 U.S.-owned ships flying foreign flags. IfCongress actually wanted a large U.S.-flag fleet, it couldeasily create one almost overnight by abolishing thebuild-American and crew-American requirements on U.S. ownersof foreign-flagged vessels who might otherwise choose to flythe Stars and Stripes. But Congress is more interested inperpetuating maritime campaign contributions -- and thosecontributions can be garnered only by federal policies thatcontinue sabotaging U.S. maritime competitiveness.   ---   Mr. Bovard writes often on trade.</TEXT></DOC>
