In1988, the Commission completed a study of the sentencing of organizationsin the Federal courts from 1984 to 1987 and a survey of the literaturerelating to sanctions for organizations. The Commission prepared a discussiondraft of sentencing materials that in July 1988 was distributed for publiccomment. Public hearings on organizational sanctions were held on October11, 1988, in New York City and on December 2, 1988, in Pasadena, California.In 1989, the Commission updated its empirical analysis with a study ofthe sentencing of organizations and associated individuals in the Federalcourts in 1988. The Commission also in 1989 received recommendations regardingorganizational sanctions from the United States Department of Justice,from a working group of private defense attorneys appointed by the Commission'sChairman to advise the Commission regarding practical principles for sentencingorganizations, and from the Commission staff. The proposed guidelines,policy statements, and commentary draw upon, and have benefitted from,staff work, aid from outside experts, and the extensive public commentthat has been received to date.<ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Background Materials</ITAG>Background materials regarding the proposed guidelines, policy statements,and commentary are available for inspection at the Commission's offices.The background materials include empirical studies, draft materials circulatedby the Commission, and public comment received by the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="84">Format of Proposed Amendments</ITAG>The proposed amendments are presented as a new chapter to the United StatesSentencing Commission Guidelines Manual: Chapter Eight_Sentencing of Organizations.Note that the Commission has set forth two options (Option I and OptionII) for the guideline section that would determine the fine guideline rangefor most organizational defendants (andSection; 8C2.1). Option I would basethe guideline fine range on the greater of loss, gain, or an amount specifiedbased upon the applicable offense level, with percentage adjustments basedupon applicable aggravating or mitigating factors. Option II would basethe guideline fine range entirely upon the applicable offense level, withoffense level adjustments based upon applicable aggravating or mitigatingfactors. In some instances, the two options may result in substantiallydifferent fine levels. Commentators are encouraged to evaluate and commentupon these two options or to suggest an alternative.The Commission has listed Specific Issues for Comment as endnotes to thedraft Chapter Eight in order to focus special attention on particular issues.Comments on all aspects of these drafts are, however, welcome.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Public Comment</ITAG>Public comment is requested regarding any aspect of current or proposedguidelines, policy statements, and commentary that apply to the sentencingof convicted organizations. In addition, the Commission requests specificcomment regarding the two options for andSection; 8C1.2 and the SpecificIssues for Comment listed at the end of the draft Chapter Eight.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 28 U.S.C. 994 (a), (x); section 21(a) of the SentencingAct of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-182).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W. Wilkins, Jr., </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Chairman.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter Eight_Sentencing of Organizations</ITAG>Introductory CommentaryThe guidelines and policy statements in this Chapter apply when the convicteddefendant in a federal criminal case is an organization rather than anindividual. In these cases, individuals may or may not simultaneously havebeen convicted of offenses growing out of the same scheme or plan of criminalconduct.The goals and purposes of sentencing for organizations are identical tothose for individuals. See 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2). Thus, sentencing of aconvicted organization can be instrumental in achieving a number of objectives.Restitution, notice to victims, and other corrective measures can be usedto remedy harm to victims or otherwise alleviate the consequences of criminalconduct. Imposition of a fine or probation can punish the owners of anorganization for its criminal conduct, and induce owners and managers totake necessary steps to prevent criminal conduct by agents of the organization.Probation can also be imposed where necessary to enforce any of the abovesanctions or to ensure that an organization institutes a remedial complianceprogram to prevent further criminal conduct by its agents.Although the number of organizations convicted and sentenced in the federalcourts over the last few years is relatively small (approximately 350 peryear) compared to the number of individuals convicted and sentenced, thesubject matter of organizational sanctions is nonetheless important. Inwriting these guidelines the Commission has been guided by two specialfeatures of the subject matter. First, the basic reasons for prosecutingand sentencing an inanimate object_an organization_are important, special,and several. In the occasional case in which an organization was createdprimarily for the purpose of facilitating the commission of criminal conduct,prosecution and sentencing should lead to its dissolution. In the morefrequent case in which an organizational defendant has benefitted fromits criminal activity, prosecution and sentencing should punish the organization,deprive it of its unjust advantage, and provide funds for restitution tovictims. When an organizational defendant, owned by a small number of individuals,some of whom have committed crimes, has assets available for payment ofrestitution or a fine, while the culpable individuals do not, convictionof the organization will enable the government to obtain those assets.In other instances, while the prosecution may be able to establish theguilt of an organization as a collective body, it may not be able to establishthe guilt of any one individual. These cases often involve complex economictransactions and numerous and changing participants, occurring over extendedperiods of time; consequently, it may be difficult to ascertain and provewhich particular individuals have been responsible. In such instances,the prosecution and sentencing of the organization will help, through determinationof guilt and appropriate punishment, to vindicate the criminal law. Finally,in virtually all instances, the appropriate punishment of a convicted organizationwill provide a strong incentive for owners and managers of organizationsto strengthen internal mechanisms for preventing officers and employeesfrom committing crimes and for detecting and punishing any such crimesthat are committed.Second, prior sentencing practice has proved less helpful to the Commission'sefforts to create organizational guidelines than in the case of individuals,because of two important legislative developments. In 1984, Congress enacteda law dramatically raising the level of fines that courts might impose.Criminal Fine Enforcement Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-596, 98 Stat. 3134.Prior to 1984, statutes often made it impossible for courts to impose uponconvicted organizations fines of meaningfully large amount. In addition,Congress has enacted over the past few years a number of statutes increasingpenalties for a variety of crimes often committed by individuals in organizations,or the organizations themselves. These include, among others, money laundering(Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, subtitle H,100 Stat. 3218-35), major fraud (Major Fraud Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-700,102 Stat. 4631), and insider trading (Insider Trading and Securities FraudEnforcement Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-704, 102 Stat. 4677). Given theselegislative changes, it is far more difficult here, than in the case ofindividual defendants, to view past practice as representing any kind of``norm.''As in the case of the guidelines for individuals, the Commission envisionsan evolutionary process in which the guidelines will be subject to modificationand refinement in light of experience.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part A_General Application Principles</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">andSection; 8A1.1 Applicability of Chapter Eight</ITAG>This Chapter applies to the sentencing of all organizations.[1]<ITAG tagnum="74">Commentary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Application Note:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. ``Organization'' means ``a person other than an individual.'' 18U.S.C. 18.

The provisions of 18U.S.C. 3663-3664 require a sentence of restitution for convictions undertitle 18 or under 49 U.S.C. 1472 (h), (i), (j), or (n), except to the extent``the court determines that the complication and prolongation of the sentencingprocess resulting from the fashioning of an order under this section outweighsthe need to provide restitution to any victims,'' 18 U.S.C. 3663(d). Thisguideline, in addition, extends the requirement of restitution to offensesother than title 18 and title 49, section 1472 (h), (i), (j) and (n) offenses.In such cases, restitution, which is to be determined under standards equivalentto those embodied in 18 U.S.C. 3663-3664, shall be provided as a conditionof a sentence of probation. Under those standards, restitution in certaincases may be awarded to a third party who already has provided compensationto the victim. See 18 U.S.C. 3663(e)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Restitution is not required to the extent that the fashioning of anorder would unduly complicate and prolong the sentencing process, relativeto the need to provide compensation to victims. In determining whetherthe complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting fromthe fashioning of an order requiring restitution outweigh the need to providecompensation to any victims, the court should consider whether civil oradministrative remedies available in an ongoing proceeding are equivalentto restitution and are certain to provide compensation to victims. If thecourt has any doubt about compensation by means other than court-orderedrestitution, the court should order restitution, which under 18 U.S.C.3663(e)(2) would be set off against a later recovery of compensatory damagesin a civil proceeding.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">andSection; 8B1.2 Remedial Orders_Organizations (Policy Statement)</ITAG>A remedial order, imposed as a condition of probation, may require theorganization to reduce or eliminate the risk that its criminal conductwill cause further harm. Such an order generally will be appropriate unless:(a) Available civil or administrative remedies are adequate and sufficientlyexpeditious; or(b) The cost to reduce or eliminate the threat of future harm is not justifiedin light of the likelihood and seriousness of injury that may result.<ITAG tagnum="74">Commentary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The purpose of a remedial order is to prevent future harm to victims.A remedial order requiring corrective action by the defendant may be necessaryto prevent future injury from the instant offense, e.g., product recallsfor food and drug violations or ``clean-up orders'' for environmental violations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">andSection; 8B1.3 Community Service_Organizations (Policy Statement)<T3>4 </T3></ITAG>An organization may be ordered to perform community service where suchcommunity service provides an expeditious way of repairing the harm causedby the offense. <ITAG tagnum="74">Commentary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An organization can perform community service only by paying its employeesor others to do so. Thus, the effect of community service on an organizationis equivalent to an indirect monetary sanction, and therefore is generallyless desirable than a direct monetary sanction such as restitution. Insome instances, however, the convicted organization may possess knowledge,facilities, or skills that uniquely qualify it to repair damage causedby the offense. Community service directed at repairing damage may providean efficient means of remedying the harm caused. See andSection;andSection;8B1.1 (Restitution_Organizations) and 8B1.2 (Remedial Orders_Organizations).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the past some forms of community service imposed on organizationshave not been related to the purposes of sentencing. Requiring a defendantto endow a chair at a university or to contribute to a local charity wouldnot be authorized by this section unless such community service provideda means for preventive or corrective action directly related to the offenseand served one of the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2).For example, a condition of probation requiring an organization to makeits laboratory facilities available to a university would be authorizedif it were subject to the limitation that the facilities be used for researchto develop new anti-pollution or clean-up techniques related to the instantoffense. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">andSection; 8B1.4 Order of Notice to Victims_Organizations </ITAG>Apply andSection; 5F1.4 (Order of Notice to Victims). <ITAG tagnum="74">Commentary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The provisions of andSection; 5F1.4 (Order of Notice to Victims) areapplicable to organizational defendants. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Part C_Fines </ITAG>1.
