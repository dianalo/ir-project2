Secretary of State James Baker cited Article 51 of the UnitedNations Charter that gives nations the right to act in self-defenseand a similar provision of the Organization of American Statestreaty as the legal basis for the invasion.   Article 21 of the OAS treaty gives the United States the rightto protect its citizens, installations and institutions, thesecretary said.   Baker also cited the terms of the Panama Canal Treaty that givethe United States the right to exercise force to protect the canalto keep it operating.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh advised President Bush aboutthe legality of the operation before it was launched, said JusticeDepartment spokesman David Runkel.   Thornburgh ``believes there is a legal basis for this actionbeing taken under U.S. law,'' Runkel said. ``It is my understandingthere is clearly legal authority under both U.S. law andinternational law.''   But two attorneys for the Center for Constitutional Rights, aliberal New York-based civil liberties group, disagree.   `I'd say it's clearly illegal under the UN Charter and the OAScharter,'' said attorney Jules Lobel, who is also a law professorat the University of Pittsburgh.   ``The United States doesn't have the right to unilaterallydecide to overthrow another governent by the use of force,'' Lobelsaid. ``Nothing that the president said today or the secretary ofstate said would give the the United States such a right.''   Lobel said the United States must show it is acting inself-defense for the invasion to be legal under the UN Charter andthe OAS treaty.   ``I don't think that can be based on some speculated threat thatAmerican citizens might be endangered,'' Lobel said. Baker hadcited an intelligence report that Panamanian Gen. Manuel AntonioNoreiga was poised to attack Americans.   ``If American citizens might be endangered, the obvious thing todo is to protect them and evacuate them not overthrow thegovernment,'' Lobel said.   Both Lobel and David Cole, another attorney for the center, saidthe invasion also violated the war-powers provision of theConstitution, which requires congressional approval of thedeployment of troops in this fashion.   ``I think the intent of the framers of the Constitution isclear, if the United States is going to offensively use militaryforce abroad it must be approved by Congress and not by fourleaders in Congress,'' Lobel said.   ``As a purely technical constitutional matter, the presidentdoes not have the authority to do what he did,'' Cole said. ``As amatter of legal and political reality, if Congress doesn't try tostop him, I think it's unlikely the courts would.''   Yale University law professor Harold Koh voiced caution aboutthe invasion, saying ``the rationale of protecting the securityofthe canal must be limited to making sure there is no damage to thecanal or some impairment of the security of the canal.''   ``It can't be an all-purpose justification of wide-rangingactions to restructure the government,'' Koh said.   Koh also expressed skepticism about justifying the invasion asan effort to arrest Noriega. ``As a matter of international law,there is a danger in converting political action into so-calledcrime fighting action.''</TEXT></DOC>
