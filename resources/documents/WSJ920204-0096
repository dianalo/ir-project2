Eight insurers, led by Prudential Insurance Co. ofAmerica, are examining the financial condition of MutualBenefit and are expected to complete their review withinthree months. Depending on the outcome, the industry'scontribution, through guaranty funds, could amount tohundreds of millions of dollars.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I am hopeful that a plan will emerge that has a safetynet feature that may make it possible to attract aninvestor,&quot; said Victor Palmieri, who was appointed by the NewJersey insurance department to oversee Mutual Benefit, whichis based in Newark.   In the short run, however, the development will meanfurther delays for policyholders, who have been withoutaccess to the cash value of their policies since July, whenMutual Benefit was seized by regulators. The insurer has,however, continued to make all regular payments topolicyholders and to pay death benefits.   Mr. Palmieri said he may not be ready to present a plan tothe courts until July. Originally, he had said that he hopedto present a plan to the courts by mid-February.   Some industry analysts have said that Mutual Benefit wouldhave had a negative net worth of between $500 million and $1billion when regulators seized the company in July if itsassets were carried at market value. Presumably, the lifeinsurance group, working on behalf of the NationalOrganization of Life and Health Guaranty Associations, wouldprovide a portion of the amount necessary to help eliminatethat deficit.   The July schedule for a plan may be set back even further,Mr. Palmieri said, because of a provision in the Bushadministration's tax package that makes it harder for him tosell or form a joint venture with other companies on MutualBenefit's corporate-owned life insurance business.   Under the proposal, companies would no longer be able todeduct the interest on loans taken out against the value oflife insurance policies on certain employees, such asdirectors. As a result, Mr. Palmieri said, most of MutualBenefit's corporate-owned life insurance policies wouldlapse.   &quot;The revenue stream from the existing block of business isa huge part of their business, representing hundreds ofmillions of dollars,&quot; Mr. Palmieri said.</TEXT></DOC>
