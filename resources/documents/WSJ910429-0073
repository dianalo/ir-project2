Germany's once-mighty currency has sunk to its lowestlevel against the Japanese yen in 17 months, losing all theground it gained in the frenzied climb that followed thecollapse of the Berlin Wall in early November 1989.</LP><TEXT>   What's more, traders and analysts warn that the mark stillhas plenty of room to fall, especially if internationalinvestors continue to be unnerved by political and economictroubles in Germany and the Soviet Union.   Late in New York on Friday, the mark was trading at 78.90yen, slightly higher than the 78.83 yen it was worth lateThursday but way below the 91 yen the German currency fetchedat the start of the year. At one point on Thursday, the marktraded as low as 78.25 yen, its lowest point sincemid-November 1989 and 14% below where it began 1991. Much ofthat decline occurred in March.   The Germany currency's high point after the Berlin Wall'sfall was 96.21 yen, set in May 1990.   Also in late Friday activity, the dollar rose to 1.7510marks and 138.10 yen from 1.7485 marks and 137.83 yen lateThursday. The British pound fell to $1.6895 from $1.6915 theprevious day.   Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Monday for aholiday.   The mark is &quot;not as bright a star as people made it out tobe,&quot; says Diego Giurleo, senior manager of treasury servicesat the Royal Bank of Canada in New York. &quot;I don't think themove {down} is over. The pressure is still on the mark.&quot;   The saga of the mark's rise and fall is one of, so far,unfulfilled expectations.   After the Berlin Wall fell, the mark was swept up in awave of ecstasy that focused on the emergence of democracy ineastern Europe. Although many analysts warned thatreunification would be financially costly for Germany, themark was snapped up on anticipation that West Germany'spowerful economy would be revved up by its union with EastGermany.   But more than a year and a half later, there is littleeuphoria about either Germany or its currency.   Recently, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl caused astir when he said German monetary union had been a disasterbecause of the deutsche mark's quick introduction into EastGermany. His remarks added fuel to worries about the highinterest rates that are pinching Germany's economy and thestubborn inflation pressures that are expected to keep thoserates from falling for some time.   Germany's political front isn't looking so hot, either. OnApril 21, the ruling Conservative Party lost the stateelections held in Rhineland-Palatinate, Chancellor HelmutKohl's home state. The vote was the first state electionsince formal unification last December and the first timesince World War II that the Conservative Party had lostcontrol of the state. The election of the leftist-leaningSocial Democrats was interpreted as a clear signal of Germandisappointment with the realities of the expensivereunification process.   Also, any fallout from the Soviet Union's political andeconomic woes is expected to have added negative impact onalready troubled Germany.   &quot;Reality strikes. It's going to be a bit of a struggle fora couple of years&quot; in Germany, says Randolph Donney, researchdirector at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.   Currency traders are especially concerned about thereaction of Japan's institutional investors to Germany'sproblems. They contend that the mark's slide so far has beenswift because Japanese investors sold marks in the forwardforeign-exchange market to hedge the value of the Germanstocks and bonds they bought after the Berlin Wall fell.Those holdings apparently weren't hedged because of theinvestors' initially strong confidence in the mark. In theforward market, currencies are bought and sold for futuredelivery on a set date at a specific price.   Some traders say the Japanese will likely step up theirdumping of marks, if the German currency falls below 78 yen.That, they say, would then pave the way for a test of the 75yen level, an important support point on charts that manytraders use to predict currency movements.   Support at 75 yen &quot;is a level which a lot of people aretalking about,&quot; says Bilal Khan, a corporate trader at FujiBank Ltd. in New York. &quot;I think we'll get there a bit slowly&quot;unless there are developments that discourage holders ofmarks, he says.   Japanese investors are shunning the mark because &quot;Germanyis really in unknown territory at this point,&quot; says DouglasOstrom, an economist at the Japan Economic Institute, aprivate, nonprofit research group in Washington. &quot;Nobodyreally knows which way&quot; to bet.   Mr. Ostrom says the mark will probably continue to weakenagainst the yen unless the Bank of Japan lowers its discountrate, currently at 6%. That would make yen-denominatedinvestments relatively less alluring.   For months, analysts have been expecting the Japanesecentral bank to ease monetary policy. But as recently asFriday, a senior Japanese Finance Ministry official said theimpact of past rate increases is still being monitored.   Whatever the course of Japanese monetary policy, themark-yen cross-rate is expected to continue to drawattention.   In cross-rate trades, currencies are bought and soldagainst one other. The dollar may or may not be used as anintermediary in the trades.   In a 1989 survey of the U.S. foreign exchange market, theFederal Reserve Bank of New York said that mark-yen tradingaccounted for 14.6% of the cross-rate transactions reportedby banks, 45.8% by nonbanks and 33.8% by currency brokers.According to the Fed survey, the mark-Swiss franccross-trades accounted for 32.4% of the cross-ratetransactions reported by banks.   But traders say mark-yen trades are now the most popular.   On some days, mark-yen transactions are &quot;the major forcein the market,&quot; says Nori Kato, a trader at the IndustrialBank of Japan Ltd. in New York.   Mark-yen options and other cross-rate options are expectedto start trading on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange nextmonth. In addition, mark-yen futures contracts and othercross-rate futures trading is expected to begin soon on theInternational Monetary Market in Chicago.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold forcurrent delivery settled at $353.90 an ounce, down 10 cents.Estimated volume was a light 1.9 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was quoted at $353.55 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
