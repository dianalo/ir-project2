The three threats occurred late Thursday night and early Fridaymorning, officials said, only a week after an attack on a booth inBrooklyn fatally burned a clerk.   ``Obviously we are extremely upset at what's been going on,''Transit Authority President David Gunn told a news conference.   Although fewer than 10 of the 70 attempted booth robberies thisyear involved the threat or actual use of a flammable liquid, Gunnsaid the TA's aim is to eliminate the possibility of another fatalattack.   Beginning Friday night, the TA police department will assign 50plainclothes and uniformed officers to token booth protection,according to Vincent Del Castillo, acting chief of the TA PoliceDepartment.   City police also will increase their patrols of subway booths,according to David Scott, chief of patrol for the New York PoliceDepartment.</TEXT></DOC>
