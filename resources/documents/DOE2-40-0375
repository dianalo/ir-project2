The key featuresof the machine include a hydraulic upper bearing which takes up mostof the guy tensioning function, a 120 by 80 ft rotor with struts at the20% and 80% height positions, single stage transmission with two pinions,two 260 kW generators, and a hydraulic power unit which supplies thehigh pressure oil to the bearings. Testing of the unit began at the factory,followed by pre-acceptance testing where a number of parameters weremonitored to provide data for engineering evaluation. Acceptance testingwas then carried out with all instrumentation operating. Emphasis wason examining structural data, in order to verify the ability to predictnatural frequencies and dynamic response. Power output performance andpower quality were also monitored. Most of the test data presented inthis paper is from the machine installed for Southern California Edison.Computerized data acquisition was used to collect the strain gauge data,and good structural data were obtained for steady windspeeds up to 50mph with gusts up to 65 mph. The measured natural frequencies are ingood agreement with predicted values. Maximum average stress observedin the blades is ca 3500-4000 psi, and most stresses are in the 2000psi range, which are all quite low values. The measured power outputis in good agreement with predicted output, and power ripple is about30% with 2 generators on line. It is concluded that the design is fundamentallysound. Some component problems were uncovered, with the main reliabilityproblems encountered in the hydraulic system. The performance has beenverified to about 400 kW. 19 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
