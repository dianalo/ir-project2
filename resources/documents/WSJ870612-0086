Managers should too.    After beating his defiant prisoner nearly senseless in the movie &quot;Cool Hand Luke,&quot; the warden dryly explains, &quot;What we have here is a failure to communicate.&quot;    All too often, that sums up relations today between many technical staffs and their corporate managers. Misunderstanding has led to confrontation, pitting the programmers in technical support against the managers in operations. In severe cases, companies have failed because seemingly brilliant technical ideas never found a market, or proved too costly to develop, or simply couldn't be used by a firm's production employees.    Managing technical staffs isn't easy. But as companies seek a technical edge to survive, more realize they must try harder. Understanding what the people in lab coats are up to is vital for nontechnical managers. &quot;They need to see the implications,&quot; says Lawrence W. Shearon, vice president of corporate technology at Medtronic Inc., a health-care devices concern.    Failure to do so can be disastrous, as Citicorp's Citibank learned. Some years ago the banking giant assigned a squad of &quot;supertechies&quot; in California to create a computerized network that could monitor every aspect of a customer's business from a checking account to the status of credit cards. The project could have generated millions in new revenue and given Citibank a huge competitive edge. Instead, it produced big bills and internal anguish; cost estimates range from $150 million to more than $200 million.    Citibank won't comment on the incident. Says one insider: &quot;The problem was that the computer power (available then) was inappropriate to the task, but those working on it said, 'Just give us another budget review.' They went from overrun to overrun.&quot; Eventually, the bank brought in another technical team that re-engineered and scaled down the project.    So whose responsibility is it to bridge such chasms? Both management and technical leadership, say the experts. And they offer the following tips on how to close the gap:    EXPAND THE CIRCLE   Technology seems to breed mistrust. Yet excluding technical managers from the inner circle can have serious consequences. First, organizations may misinterpret critically important information and make the wrong business judgment. Second, the technical manager may turn hostile. Often &quot;they will lose organizational battles and end up feeling misunderstood, powerless and victimized by the organization,&quot; says Peter K. Krembs, a management consultant. That can put the entire organization at risk. &quot;It's not a question of how you prevent technical people from impacting on business but how to make sure you get technical input into business decisions,&quot; says Gerald P. Dinneen, corporate vice president of science and technology at Honeywell Inc.    SHOW THEM THE BIG PICTURE   Engineers seldom are taught to think strategically. &quot;They're very project-oriented. They don't deal with other people and concerns and issues until they get to the top spot,&quot; says Bruce L. Miller, head of information services at Aon Corp., a Chicago insurer. Some companies aren't waiting that long. To see the ramifications of their ideas, Bemis Co., a packager, often has its engineers accompany sales people to hear customer needs first-hand. Control Data Corp. routinely rotates new engineers through sales and other departments. Engineering schools, responding to industry, are teaching management basics to undergraduates. The University of Missouri offers on-the-job management training to company technical staffs.    STICK TO THE ROAD   The best operations managers don't try to grab the steering wheel away from technical managers; they don't change signals and they don't try to rush projects. &quot;When I've seen technical people fail, it's because they were misdirected originally, or their directions were changed,&quot; says Medtronic's Mr. Shearon. &quot;You have to set a goal and let them work at it.&quot; Often the incubation period for new products is lengthy and &quot;a lot of things can change.&quot;    SAY THAT AGAIN?   Technical and nontechnical people often speak different dialects. &quot;It's vital that technical people clearly explain what they're trying to do in terms of the business,&quot; says Honeywell's Mr. Dinneen. Once, during a Pentagon stint, he ordered a letter rewritten 10 times before he'd sign it, it was so full of acronyms. Some companies prepare glossaries for new employees. Mr. Dinneen also thinks too many operations managers are technical dummies, and he suggests &quot;they learn something about calculus and physics.&quot;    SHARE THE WEALTH   Some companies lose talented technical people because the only way they can pay them big money is to push them into management. The candidate may view management as a demotion, or at least a distraction from research. Some companies are working around that by installing &quot;dual ladders&quot; that allow skilled researchers to remain on the technical side while advancing to executive pay and perks. Medtronic's top scientists get the same offices and status as senior managers. Control Data and others have stock plans to help retain technical talent.    LET TECHS MANAGE TECHS   Putting a nontechnical manager in charge of a laboratory is risky. First, projects may founder because the manager is fuzzy on their implications, doesn't know what resources to fight for and can't defend inevitable delays. His naivete also leaves him vulnerable to subordinates. &quot;The person without a technical background can be eaten alive,&quot; says a vice president of technology. Experts especially advise against starting MBAs on the technical side. &quot;I've never seen it work,&quot; says Mr. Krembs, the consultant.    THEY'RE NOT MAGICIANS   Silicon Valley is littered with start-up computer companies that promised the moon, then couldn't deliver. Sales people need to understand what's possible to invent and how long it will take. Another problem: nontechnical managers often think a technical guru knows more than he does. &quot;The guy may be an expert in one narrow field, but managers may project that to believe his is a broad horizon,&quot; says Medtronic's Mr. Shearon. &quot;It's incumbent on the technical manager to admit his limitations.&quot;    BUT THEY CAN HELP   Data-processing departments often are overlooked management assets, says Aon's Mr. Miller. He thinks too many managers treat data processing like a pizza parlor. &quot;Instead of saying, 'Send me a pepperoni,' managers should ask, 'What are today's specials?'&quot; Mr. Miller adds that managers should take advantage of the data-processing department's understanding of how various operations mesh and encourage the computer staff to provide service that goes beyond &quot;just shoveling out something.&quot;    ---   Mr. Gibson is a staff reporter based in The Wall Street Journal's Minneapolis bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
