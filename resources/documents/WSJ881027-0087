Manufacturers who trimmed production expecting a lackluster year now are seeing sales turn upward. The result: shortages of low-end videocassette recorders, many color TV sizes, compact-disk players and microwave ovens. &quot;We are going to be out of a number of things during the fourth quarter,&quot; says Jerry Pearlman, chairman of Zenith Electronics Corp., Glenview, Ill. Toshiba America Inc., Wayne, N.J., reports &quot;tight&quot; inventory for some VCRs and TV sets, saying that it would take four months for any increased production to be felt.    But the shortages aren't making anyone in the industry &quot;particularly unhappy,&quot; says David Lachenbruch of Television Digest. &quot;This is going to give them a real opportunity to raise prices,&quot; he says, noting past price rises haven't stuck. Zenith this month raised some prices 1.5% to 2%. Other firms expect to boost prices after Jan. 1.    The impact on consumers: &quot;Nobody will have to go without,&quot; but they may have to settle for a different brand, says Mr. Lachenbruch.    CELEBRITY SCENTS proliferate in a competitive fragrance market.    Success of Elizabeth Taylor's Passion has fragrance makers developing their own celebrity entries. &quot;This is probably the beginning of a significant trend,&quot; says Lawrence Pesin of Colonia Inc. U.S., Orange, Conn., which is now planning fragrances from Priscilla Presley and Julio Iglesias. Also in the works: scents from Cher, Joan Collins and Mikhail Baryshnikov.    Fragrance marketers say celebrity labels provide ready-made consumer awareness in a market awash with new entries. The Fragrance Foundation lists at least 45 for this year and next. &quot;The marketing mission today is to be able to steal share of market from existing business,&quot; says Martin Danielson of Parlux Ltd., New York, which will launch the Joan Collins line this spring. Still, classic fragrances like Chanel hold their own. &quot;Women in their late 30s and early 40s are returning to classics their mothers wore,&quot; says consultant Allan Mottus.    PUMPKIN-PATCH WOES mean higher prices for Halloween jack-o'-lanterns.    Many Midwest pumpkins fell prey to drought or developed bumps from the summer heat, while crops in parts of the Southwest suffered from mold caused by too much rain. But big Colorado growers had a bumper crop and now are benefiting from other regions' woes. &quot;We've had calls for pumpkins from all over the country,&quot; says Lewis Grant of Piedmont Farms, Fort Collins, Colo., who has shipped to Michigan and New Jersey. The result: prices up anywhere from 10% to 50%.    Pumpkin marketers say rising prices haven't dented demand, thanks in part to the transformation of the pumpkin purchase into a family experience. Funk's Farm Market, Millersville, Pa., opens Pumpkinland, offering life-size papier-mache cows and witches, hayrides and pumpkin-patch tours. On a nice autumn weekend, 2,000 people a day will take hayrides and clamber through Larry Schaake's pumpkin patch just outside Lawrence, Kan.    Soaring demand for decorative six-inch pumpkins has pushed prices to $23.50 a bushel from only $8 last year, says Funk Farm's Mr. Funk.    RECYCLED PACEMAKERS win U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for export, reversing a longstanding policy that prohibited reuse. Implant Technologies Inc., Bothell, Wash., has some 2,500 of the cardiac devices stockpiled and plans to begin exporting by year end.    AMERICAN CITIES drop in the ranks of the world's most expensive, says a Union Bank of Switzerland survey of prices and earnings in 52 cities. New York drops to 10th place from third in 1985, Chicago falls to 12th from sixth and Los Angeles' rank slips to 32 from 22. Tokyo ranks first.    A HIGH NOTE: Opera and musical theater drew a record 17.7 million attendees in the 1987-88 season, says the Central Opera Service. Major companies saw the most growth. Those with budgets over $100,000 increased the number of performances 25% but saw expenses rise only 9.7%.    HOTEL PROFITS remain elusive, as construction begins again.    U.S. hotels lost a median of $748 a room in 1987, says Saul Leonard of consultant Laventhol andamp; Horwath. This year won't turn out much better. The reason? With the economy &quot;stronger than anticipated&quot; this summer, hotel construction has resumed, most noticeably in the economy and all-suite markets. Mr. Leonard now doesn't expect profitability, hotel occupancy or room rates to improve until the end of 1989 or early 1990.    The numbers partly reflect properties operated by smaller chains and independents, says Laurence Geller of Hyatt Development Corp., Chicago. He's been &quot;surprised by the volume of trouble properties we've had coming in to talk with us.&quot; Some markets remain healthy. &quot;New York City is very strong. Even with new supply coming on, it will remain very strong,&quot; says Gregory Bohan of Pannell Kerr Forster, New York.    The hotel life cycle gets shorter, says Gerald Petitt of Quality International, noting hotels now must refurbish every five to seven years.    BRIEFS: New Jersey Institute of Technology opens a research center to tackle problems of hazardous waste, beach pollution and landfill capacity. . . . Manhattan haberdasher Paul Stuart designs shirts with a side loop for use during meals to help men keep their ties out of the gravy. </TEXT></DOC>
