The march was planned as part of a nationwide campaign to defyapartheid laws. The movement has intensified in the days leading upto Wednesday's parliamentary elections, which exclude the blackmajority.   In one dramatic incident, a young white activist climbed atop amobile water cannon that was spraying purple-dyed water at theprotesters. He turned the hose away so that it sprayed an officebuilding housing offices of the ruling National Party, scuffled witha policeman, then ran into the crowd.   Police were heard giving orders that anyone seen with purple dyeon their clothes should be detained.   Among the estimated 450 protesters arrested was the Rev. AllanBoesak, a prominent mixed-race activist who is president of theWorld Alliance of Reformed Churches. Police said 52 journalists,many of them foreign reporters, also were arrested when policeinvoked emergency regulations barring on-scene coverage of unrest.   The protesters and 50 of the journalists were released severalhours later. It was not clear if the protesters would be chargedlater with joining an illegal gathering.   Two crewmen for the London-based Visnews television network weretold they would be held and charged.   Dozens were reported injured. After the police action, more than1,500 protesters, some injured and others soaked in purple dye,crowded into St. George's Cathedral for a service led by AnglicanArchbishop Desmond Tutu.   ``All moral right is on your side,'' Tutu told the multi-racialthrong. ``We have committed ourselves to this struggle until freedomis won.''   Near the end of the service, Tutu asked the crowd to repeat afterhim, ``We shall be free, all of us together, black and white, in afree South Africa.''   The South African Council of Churches, to which Tutu and Boesakare affiliated, said in a statement that the government ``hasdeclared an open war on the church and the people.''   At least two large groups of protesters began separate marches inthe city center before being dispersed. One group of about 700 satdown in a street bordering a market square crowded with shoppers andsang a freedom song as the water cannon was brought in.   Another group, led by Boesak, set out from St. George's Cathedralbefore police moved in, beating and whipping the marchers and usingtear gas.   Before his arrest, Boesak said many people who wanted to join themarch had been stopped at police roadblocks while trying to leaveoutlying black and mixed-race townships.   Journalists said police arrested several medics trying to treatinjured protesters, and at one point took away both medics andpatients at a temporary clinic.   Police raided at least one television news bureau, arrested a CBScameraman at his hotel room, and detained journalists andphotographers working for numerous South African and foreign newsmedia, including The Associated Press, NBC, Reuters and theindependent South African Press Association.   A TV crew from the state-controlled South African BroadcastingCorp. was also detained during the round-up.      A Law and Order Ministry spokesman, Brig. Leon Mellet, said: ``Wecannot allow these propaganda efforts by the Mass DemocraticMovement (organizer of the defiance campaign) to tarnish SouthAfrica's image abroad, where a destructive view is being created bytotally slanted reports emanating from South Africa.''   The march was one of the major events planned this weekend by theMass Democratic Movement. Police banned a rally scheduled forSaturday in Soweto and reported that white right-wing extremists hadset off bombs near a whites-only beach in Durban where blacks andIndians plan a mass sit-in on Sunday.   The defiance campaign began Aug. 2 and has intensified as theelections approach. The black majority is excluded from Parliament.   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, quoted governmentsources Saturday as saying that 17 leaders of the defiance campaignhad been detained and 13 others were being sought, including somewho had gone into hiding.   In Soweto, the township of 2.5 million blacks, scores ofpolicemen and soldiers were stationed at Jabulani Stadium, whereSaturday's ``peace rally'' had been scheduled to take place.Security forces also ringed a nearby Roman Catholic church which inthe past has been used an alternative site for banned outdoorrallies.   In Durban, police said several small bombs exploded overnight intrash bins along the port city's beachfront. Pamphlets left by thebins denounced the plans by activists to stage a sit-in Sunday onthe whites-only section of the beach.   According to police headquarters, more than 440 protesters werearrested across the country Friday, including Tutu, his wife, Leah,and Boesak's wife, Dorothy. Those three were among 36 peoplearrested and later released while marching to protest the beating ofchurch workers during a demonstration earlier Friday in Cape Town.</TEXT></DOC>
