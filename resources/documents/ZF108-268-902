 400 on Reader Service CardandM;Seated comfortably at their keyboards, many Mac users have longed to soarwhere none of their kind have flown before.andP;  Far above the lower altitudeswhere most PC users travel are blue skies open to fast-moving Unixworkstations.andP;  But, unwilling to fly without their Mac amenities--includingan easy-to-use interface and access to a host of Mac applications--many Macusers with an itch to control a high-powered machine have been limited totheir dreams.andM;Ever since the introduction of the Macintosh and its graphical userinterface--and particularly since the debut of the Macintosh II, with colorcapabilities and a Motorola 68020 processor--distrinctions between personalcomputers and workstations have been blurring.andP;  Workstation manufacturers areintroducing low-end workstations like Apollo's DN2500, wife PC manufacturersare coming out with high-end PCs like Compaq's SystemPro.andM;Based on the Motorola 68030/68882 CPU/floating-point co-processorcombination, in which both processors run at 40MHz, Apple's Macintosh IIfxdoubles the clock speed of previous Macintoshes.andP;  The higher clock speed,coupled with some major architectural changes such as the addition of 32KB ofzero wait-state, static cache RAM and separate processors to handle I/O, givethe Macintosh IIfx better than double the performance of previous Macs.andM;Offering a graphical user interface and a wide range of applications, theMacintosh has always been easy and convenient to use.andP;  This might explain whyfew Mac users chose to take advantage of early releases of A/UX, Apple's Macimplementation of Unix: Mac users prefer their icon-based interface to atypical Unix interface.andM;Apple's newest release of A/UX, version 2, offers more features and is mucheasier to use than its predecessors.andP;  Running version 2.0 of A/UX, theMacintosh IIfx gains all the strengths of Unix while preserving access to theMacintosh's established base of more than 6,000 applications running underthe Mac operating system and providing access to the familiar Mac interface.andM;A/UX even features its own implementation of the X windows protocol.andP;  DR Labsbenchmarked this implementation and found it to be on a par with theDECstation 3100's implementation of X.andM;We also ran our CPU 2 benchmark tests on the Macintosh IIfx and found that itdelivers CPU performance in line with many low-end workstations.andP;  But thevalue of the Macintosh IIfx goes far beyond its CPU power.andP;  A unique blend ofPC and Unix workstation, the Macintosh IIfx takes the best features from eachwhile leaving many of their limitations behind.andM;The Macintosh IIfx looks very much like the Macintosh II.andP;  They're bothpackaged in the same platinum box, and opening the Macintosh IIfx box revealsonly one obvious addition: a processor direct slot above the NuBus.andP;  Butdespite the obvious similarities, some important differences exist betweenthe two machines.andM;The addition of a 32-bit processor direct slot allows Macintosh IIfx users toplug third-party hardware directly into the system bus.andP;  This capability willprovide a platform for future frame buffers and co-processors.andP;  Unliketraditional Mac add-ons, which had to rely on the NuBus connection,peripherals that connect to the processor direct slot will be able to accessdata at the same speed as the CPU.andM;Probably the most significant change to the Mac architecture is the additionof dedicated I/O processors.andP;  The inclusion of these processors in the IIfxmarks Apple's recognition that the main CPU can't handle all I/O requests anddeliver high performance simultanously.andM;Apple uses two ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) built on itsown 2MHz 6502 as peripheral interface controllers to manage I/O processing onthe floppy disk drives, the Apple Desktop Bus and serial ports.andP;  The floppydisk drives are controlled by the SWIM (Super Wozniak Integrated Machine)chip.andP;  The Apple Desktop and serial ports are controlled by the serialcommunication controller chip.andM;The Macintosh IIfx also includes a 53C80 SCSI/DMA controller from NCR thatimproves SCSI performance.andM;Like most of the more recent additions to the Mac family, the Macintosh IIfxsports a 3-1/2-inch, 1,4MB SuperDrive and as much as 160MB of internal harddisk storage, as well as a wide variety of monochrome and color monitors ofvirtually any size.andM;The SuperDrive can read 3-1/2-inch disks that have been formatted on an IBMPC.andP;  This means that, in addition to stroing a lot of data on one floppydisk, Macintosh IIfx users can use Apple's File Exchange utility to exchangefiles with IBM PCs and CP clones running either MS-DOS or OS/2.andM;To supplement the storage that comes standard with the Macintosh IIfx, userscan add an additional external SuperDrive and any amount of external harddisk storage they can connect to the SCSI port.andM;The Macintosh IIfs comes with 4MB of RAM, which can be upgraded to 8MB with1MB SIMMs (single in-line memory modules).andP;  Users will be able to upgrade to32MB when 4MB SIMMs become widely available.andP;  Because the Macintosh IIfx'sclock speed is higher than that of other Macs, its main processor demands RAMwith faster access time--80 nonoseconds (ns) as opposed to the 120ns providedby other members of the Macintosh II family.andM;All of the Macs in the Macintosh II series, including the Macintosh IIfx andthe Mac SE/30, can run both A/UX and the Mac operating system.andP;  The newversion of A/UX, 2.0, includes some significant enhancements.andM;A/UX is Apple's version of release 2, version 2 of ATandamp;T's Unix System V with4.3BSD extension.andP;  But unlike most other implementations of Unix, A/UXretains many aspects of the Mac operating system's intuitive icon-basedinterface, called the Desktop, while still complying completely with theSystem V Interface Definition specifications.andM;This melding of the Unix and Macintosh operating systems gives userspoint-and-click access to all their files.andP;  A/UX supports MultiFinder, whichoffers limited multitasking and Macintosh-style start-up and shutdown.andM;A/UX presents users with the familiar Finder Desktop interface.andP;  The menu barthat appears at the top of the screen includes the Apple, File and Editmenus.andP;  Users can control disks and system operations with either Unixcommands or the simple Macintosh operating system mouse movements.andM;Another enhancement could be even more significant: In addition to regularUnix applications, A/UX is now compatible with Macintosh operating systemapplications that adhere to the specifications for the 32-bit Mac environment(called &quot;32-bit clean&quot;).andP;  Examples of 32-bit-clean applications includeMicrosoft Word 4.0, Informix's Wingz, Claris' MacWrite II and Apple'sHyperCard.andP;  Using MultiFinder, users can run Macintosh and Unix applicationssimultaneously and switch between them without quitting from either.andM;This ability to switch seamlessly between Macintosh and Unix applicationsofers even the novice Unix user immediate gratification: access to a decentmouse-driven text editor.andP;  In addition to a friendly editor, f course, theUnix user can now access more than 6,000 other Mac applications that rununder A/UX.andM;A/UX, like most Unix variants, also supports true multitasking.andP;  In addition,it allows execution of &quot;hybrid&quot; Unix-Mac applications that call the Mactoolbox.andP;  And, with the purchase of one of Apple's implementations of MIT's XWindow System, A/UX users can run even X applications (Fig.andP;  1).andM;Apple distributes two versions of X for the Mac running A/UX: the full X22fpr A/UX and an enhanced version called MacX.andM;The full implementation of X, like any other implementation of X11R4 (thecurrent version of X) provides graphics libraries, an application developmenttool kit and all the standard &quot;include&quot; files.andP;  Also included are twm (Tom'sWindow Manager), support for backing store and save under features--whichspeed screen redrawing by storing covered images in RAM--and all the standardX applications, such as xtem, xclock and xcalc.andP;  There is also a mouse-basedscreen editor called xedit.andM;The main drawback of using the full implementation of X on the Mac is theloss of access to the features of the Mac operating system.andP;  MacX gives usersaccess not only to a robust implementation of X11R3, but to the Mac operatingsystem as well.andM;Because DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmark suite is written in Fortran, Applerecommended we benchmark the Maxintosh IIfx with both A/UX's f77 (Unix'sgeneric Fortran compiler) and a third-party optimizing Fortran compiler fromNKR Research of San Jose, Calif.andM;With Apple's f77, the Macintosh IIfx was able to achieve 1.61 microVAX IIUnits of Processing (MVUPs).andP;  However, because f77 does not support all VAXFortran extensions, we had to make one change to the source code, changing aTYPE statement to a WRITE statement.andM;With NKR's Fortran, the Macintosh IIfx achieved 2.63 MVUPs, and we didn'thave to alter the code (Fig.andP;  2).andP;  In fact NKR Fortran supports extended datatypes, file I/O extensions, operations like $VAL and DOUBLE COMPLEXintrinsics and statements like the IMPLICIT NONE option.andP;  VAX users shouldhave little trouble porting Fortran code to the Mac using NKR Fortran.andM;In addition, DR Labs also ran the X11 perf X window performance benchmark.andO;The Macintosh IIfx achieved an astounding 0.99 DECstation 3100 X units ofperformance (DXUPs) on our single-window test, putting it in a league withthe DECstation 3100.andP;  (For an explanation of how we derived our DXUPmeasurement, see &quot;Birth of a benchmark: DR Labs debuts the DXUP,&quot; DR, Feb.andO;26, page 32.)andM;Finally, as a test of A/UX's compatibility with regular Macintoshapplications, we ran a number of applications, which included Microsoft Word4.0, Quark-XPress, a game called SIM City and Adobe Illustrator.andP;  Thesepackages represent a cross section of the types of applications--wordprocessing, desktop publishing, games and drawing tools--that are runfrequently on the Macintosh.andP;  We had no trouble running any of theseprograms.andM;The Macintosh IIfx running A/UX represents a hybrid between PC andworkstation, uniting the best qualities of both: more than 6,000 applicationsfor the Mac, plus Unix capabilities.andM;According to our measurements, the strength of those Unix capabilities isconsiderable.andP;  The Macintosh IIfx's CPU power is in the same league with theHP 9000 Model 375, and its single-window X performance is similar to theDECstation 3100's.andM;This combintion of moderate CPU power and very high X performance does notmake the Macintosh IIfx a number cruncher.andP;  Although the Macintosh IIfxdoesn't offer the raw CPU horsepower of a RISC-based workstation, itsfeatures--inlcuding access to Mac applications--more than make up for thelimitation.andP;  It's a machine of considerable finesse, balanced and ready toperform most general-purpose tasks.andM;Users who have been discouraged by the lack of software for Unix workstationsand those who have felt limited by PCs, will find that the Macintosh IIfxbreaks through old barriers.andP;  Some workstations have been faster, but nonehas traveled in the MAc's grand style.andM;TEST LAB MODELandM;DR Labs benchmarked Apple's Macintosh IIfx with 8MB of main memory, a 160MBhard disk and a 13-inch color monitor.andP;  We ran A/UX version 2.0 and Apple'simplementation of MIT's X Window System.andM;Since workstations are designed for compute-intensive scientific andengineering applications and are meant to free users from the need to sharedepartmental computer systems, the CPU power of such machines must besubstantial.andM;To evaluate the ability of the Apple Macintosh IIfx to satisfy this demandfor processing power, we ran DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmark suite.andP;  CPU 2 measuresa system's ability to handle scientific and engineering applications.andP;  Itsresults reflect the raw speed of a CPU, the efficiency of a system's Fortrancompiler, and--to a lesser extent--the speed of memory access.andP;  The resultsare not affected by a system's I/O capabilities.andM;The Mac is of course, a highly graphical machine.andP;  Many of the graphicsapplications in existence today use MIT's X Window System.andP;  To evaluate thesingle-window performance of Appie's implementation of this system, weemployed a benchmark called X11 perf.andM;X11 perf contains 166 kemels developed by MIT's X Consortium.andP;  Together,these kemels test most X features.andP;  We break these tests into 39 generalgroups (rectangles, circles, text, circulating windows, etc).andP;  We run each ofthe X11 perf tests five times and calculate the geometric mean of the resultsto arrive at performance figures for the 39 groups in our table.andP;  The groupsare divided into four areas: generla graphics, terminal emulation, windowmanagement and X-specific operations.andM;To provide an indication of the Macintosh IIfx's overall single-windowperformance, we took the aggregate geometric mean of the 39 groups tocalculate the DECstation 3100 X units of performance, a measure ofperformance normalized to the results of the same tests on a DECstation 3100.andM;The ability of A/UX to run Macintosh applications that adhere to thespecifications of the Macintosh 32-bit environment will appeal to many userswho need a Unix workstation and want the standard Macintosh applications.andM;As test of A/UX's compatibility with applications written for the Macintoshoperating system that adhere to the specifications of the Macintosh 32-bitenvironment, we also ran several Macintosh applications, including MicrosoftWord, QuarkXPress, a game called SIM City and Adobe Illustrator.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
