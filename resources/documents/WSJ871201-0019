The dollar fell 1% to stand at 132.24 Japanese yen in late New York trading, down from 133.55 Friday, and dropped 0.9% to 1.6396 West German marks, from 1.6540. The dollar's intraday lows of 131.98 yen and 1.6315 marks eclipsed the previous lows of 133.22 yen and 1.6490 marks, and were the lowest levels since the modern exchange rate system was established after World War II.    In early trading Tuesday in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 132.30 yen. The Bank of Japan was reported to have intervened, buying dollars.    Major central banks -- including the U.S. Federal Reserve -- yesterday bought dollars as the trading day moved around the globe and the currency continued to slide, traders said. But the volume of market intervention by the central banks was described as light and probably intended only to smooth out trading. &quot;Everyone is firmly of the belief that it's merely a smoothing action. Dealers don't really fear the central banks&quot; at this time, said Douglas Madison, a trader at BankAmerica International, New York.    The dollar began slipping at the opening of trading yesterday in Asia and continued lower through the European business day. Traders expressed disappointment with the U.S. plan, announced last month, to reduce the budget deficit and concern that Congress won't approve it anyway.    Despite indications that yesterday's drop in the dollar and stock market would hasten a meeting of finance officials of the seven major industrial nations, traders speculated such a meeting was unlikely in the absence of a firm budget-reduction plan. That would make any coordinated action to stabilize the dollar improbable in the near term, they said.    &quot;If there is a meeting, it probably won't be until next year. So the real risk (for the dollar) is on the downside,&quot; said Varick Martin, vice president of foreign exchange at Union Bank of Switzerland's New York branch.    In February the Group of Seven -- consisting of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy, and Canada -- signed the Louvre accord in Paris which set trading bands that weren't disclosed for major dollar exchange rates and was widely credited for stabilizing currency fluctuations throughout much of the year. The bands were lowered this fall. But many traders believe the U.S. seeks a further decline of the dollar before convening a Group of Seven meeting. In theory, a weaker dollar will help reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit by making imports more expensive and exports more cost-competitive. The negative effect of a weaker dollar on the exports of major trading partners would also pressure other Group of Seven members to pursue expansionary fiscal policies that the U.S. seeks. Faster growth abroad would also spur U.S. exports.    &quot;I absolutely think it is&quot; U.S. policy to encourage the dollar's decline, Mr. Martin said. He noted that administration officials made no statements regarding the dollar as the U.S. currency set new lows yesterday.    In addition to the rumored intervention by the Fed, the Bank of Japan and West German Bundesbank were believed to be buying small amounts of dollars in the open market yesterday to maintain orderly trading, dealers said. At the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing, the West German central bank purchased $44.9 million as the dollar was officially priced against the mark in the daily auction.    Dealers said they didn't expect the dollar's stability in New York trading yesterday to last long. Traders attributed the dollar's leveling off to cautiousness as the U.S. currency was quoted near its lows, as opposed to any buying interest. &quot;There's a paucity of buyers,&quot; said BankAmerica's Mr. Madison. &quot;The downtrend seems to have a life of its own. It's going to take a major crescendo of selling to reverse the trend,&quot; he said.    The usual year-end slowdown in trading activity is also expected to work against the dollar. &quot;The liquidity in the market is drying up. So whatever the trend in the market is will be exaggerated,&quot; Michael S. McGuinness, a foreign exchange officer at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said. &quot;I don't think we've seen the bottom at all,&quot; he added.    Also exacerbating a downward move by the dollar is the fact that many strategic market players won't buy dollars aggressively until it appears to have bottomed and begins recovering. &quot;A lot of American companies aren't interested in picking a bottom. They'd rather miss the bottom and catch the dollar bouncing up. So there's an absence of buyers,&quot; said Mr. Martin at Union Bank of Switzerland.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $4.90 an ounce to $491 in brisk trading. The estimated volume was 5.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $489.75 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.
