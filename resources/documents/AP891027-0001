Police in Chiclayo said a report from Bagua, a river town 435miles north of Lima, said the four were shot to death and theirbodies dumped into the Maranon River. The report said the bodieswere seen in the river Oct. 10 near Santa Maria de Nieva, 600 milesnorth of Lima, but they were not retrieved.   The victims were on a filming expedition of Aguaruna Indians onthe Maranon in the northeastern state of Amazonas, according toJulio Quispe, a telephone company official in Chiclayo, 465 milesnorth of Lima.   Quispe said in a telephone interview that he was in radiocontact with Wilder Sanchez, a telephone company employee andbrother of Ramiro Sanchez, the mining engineer.   Quispe said Wilder Sanchez went to the area after hearing hisbrother had been killed and gave the following account:   The Frenchmen, all in their 20s, were on a canoe trip followingthe Maranon from its source in the Andes to the Amazon basin whenthey met Ramiro Sanchez, a 23-year-old engineer working at a goldmining project.   The engineer, who spoke French and was familiar with the area,agreed to accompany the students on their expedition. After beingbriefly detained Oct. 6 at an army outpost at Puerto Imazita, 495miles north of Lima, the four continued down the river and on Oct.7 stopped at Puerto Nativo de Chipe, a village of Aguaruna Indiansnear Santa Maria de Nieva.   He said the Indians apparently attacked when the group tried tofilm members of the tribe.   The Lima newspaper El Comercio said reports broadcast by a radiostation in Jaen, a town 445 miles north of Lima, said one of thestudents was shot when some Indians tried to steal the group's filmequipment. It said the three other victims tried to escape in aboat but were pursued and slain by the Aguarunas.   Victoria Pita, spokeswoman for the French Embassy in Lima, saidofficials there had no information on the reports and wereinvestigating. There were conflicting versions of the names of thestudents and she said the embassy was attempting to determine theidentities.   In the same area in 1979, a group of Aguaruna Indians attackedand burned the camp of German film director Werner Herzog duringthe filming of the movie ``Fitzcarraldo.''   The Aguaruna are a branch of the Jivaro tribe, known for itspoison-dart blowguns and history of head-hunting. Most of theIndians, who are believed to number about 30,000, are fisherman orsmall-plot farmers.   Quispe said Sanchez told him over the radio that the names ofthe Frenchmen were Jaime Terry Paul, 24, Joseph Trichpo Olarf, 28,and Jean Christophe Monviale, 24.</TEXT></DOC>
