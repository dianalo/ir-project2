Rep. Thomas J. Tauke, R-Iowa, a leading opponent of the raise,said he's now focusing on a long-range strategy that would roll backthe increase, and change the system that permits it to become lawwithout a vote.   And Rep. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., who has organized a Houseletter-writing drive to Speaker Jim Wright demanding a vote, said,``We cannot budge the speaker.''   In the Senate, opposition continued to grow Wednesday afterlegislation was filed to block the increase.   Opposition was turned up a notch outside Congress, too, as threepart-time musicians from the Detroit area released an anti-raiseprotest song, ``Tea Bag Revolution.'' The title, with its referenceto the Boston Tea Party, comes from efforts of 30 radio talk showhosts, who are behind a national drive to send tea bags to lawmakerswith the message: ``Read my tea bag. No fifty percent raise forCongress.''   Legislation that would reject the pay raise, and roll it backshould it take effect, was introduced Wednesday in the Senate. Thelegislation had a dozen sponsors in the morning, and 23 by day's end_ nearly a quarter of the 100-member Senate.   The proposed pay raise for members of Congress, judges and topexecutive branch officials would become law automatically Feb. 8unless each chamber rejects it. Rank-and-file lawmakers would seetheir pay go from $89,500 to $135,000.   Opponents of the raise were grasping at anything that could givethem momentum Wednesday.   When House Minority Whip Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., sent out a letterthat no votes were scheduled through Feb. 8, House pay-raiseopponents scheduled a news conference for today to urge a vote.   Pete Williams, a spokesman for Cheney, said the schedule was forplanning purposes and ``never intended to have any significance forthe pay raise.''   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, a co-sponsor of the legislationto roll back the pay raise, remembered that President Bush said hewould ``have something to say'' about the raise after he wasinaugurated.   Grassley wrote Bush on Wednesday, ``You must choose betweenaligning yourself with Speaker (Jim) Wright and a dozen in the Houseleadership who favor the raise...and the 85 percent of the Americanpeople who oppose the issue.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters, ``we arewatching congressional action at the moment.''   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said Tuesday the HouseDemocratic leadership does not plan to schedule a vote before thedeadline.   Mark Johnson, a spokesman for Wright, D-Texas, said the speakerhas not given indications a vote would be scheduled to stop theraise.   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, has promiseda Senate vote on rejecting the raise before the deadline.   But he told reporters Wednesday, ``I favor a comprehensiveapproach that includes enactment of the ethics bill the presidentvetoed, campaign finance reform, a ban on honoraria and enactment ofcompensation to offset the loss in honoraria.''   He said the package could not be pulled together before theautomatic trigger for the raise.   The ethics bill, vetoed by Reagan and introduced again Wednesdayby Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., would restrict lobbying by formermembers of Congress, their staffs and top executive branchofficials. Campaign finance reform would impose limits on campaignspending.   The National Taxpayers Union, a non-profit group organizingopposition to the pay raise, played the new protest song forreporters. It was recorded by Keith Wood, Rich Boehms and Mike Grass.   The chorus goes:   ``There's no more money, we're angry as can be.   ``So we've joined the Tea Bag Revolution.   ``Repeating history.''   And one of the verses says:   ``We've come to be that money tree.   ``They pick from more and more.   ``Now I think it's time, the people remind them, who they'reworking for.''</TEXT></DOC>
