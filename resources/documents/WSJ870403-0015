GenCorp, in a filing in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, charged that Shearson, the dealer-manager for a hostile tender offer by General Partners, violated securities laws by using its position as GenCorp's investment and financial adviser to assist the hostile bid.    The Akron, Ohio-based tire, aerospace and broadcasting concern yesterday named Shearson as a defendant in a lawsuit it filed last month against General Partners. That partnership, consisting of Midland, Texas-based oil and gas producer Wagner andamp; Brown and Irvine, Calif.-based glass maker AFG Industries Inc., last month launched a hostile $100-a-share tender offer for GenCorp.    In New York, Shearson's general counsel, David Hershberg, said he had no knowledge of the suit and therefore couldn't comment.    Shearson, in addition to its role as dealer-manager, is also advising the partnership in the tender offer and providing a $1.25 billion bridge loan to finance the tender offer.    The lawsuit charged that Shearson and General Partners &quot;traded upon material, non-public inside information, as well as upon confidential and proprietary&quot; data &quot;misappropriated by Shearson from GenCorp.&quot; The partnership holds 9.8% of GenCorp's 22.3 million shares outstanding.    General Partners also declined to comment on the suit.    GenCorp said that as a result of Shearson's position as its financial adviser, it provided the investment banking firm with proprietary non-public information about its financing and acquisition policies and its management attitudes. Alleging that Shearson breached its fiduciary duty to a client, GenCorp said the information &quot;could only have been secured through the intimate and confidential relationship shared between Shearson and GenCorp.&quot; Shearson served as GenCorp's adviser &quot;prior to and during its involvement with General Partners,&quot; the suit states.    &quot;To the extent that Shearson, while it was advising GenCorp, knew or should have known that it planned to advise and recommend to Wagner andamp; Brown to commence a hostile tender offer for GenCorp, Shearson had a duty to disclose that fact to GenCorp,&quot; the suit charged.    In that filing yesterday, GenCorp cited several instances in which Shearson advised it on major transactions, including, in June 1986, a prospective leveraged buyout of GenCorp's tire unit, General Tire Inc.    Shearson also initiated contact with GenCorp about two proposed acquisitions, according to the filing. In October 1986, Shearson queried GenCorp on its interest in acquiring Sperry Corp.'s Sperry Marine Systems Division. Though interested, GenCorp dropped the idea the following month when Shearson approached it about buying the aerospace unit of Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. for $600 million.    GenCorp said A. William Reynolds, its chairman and chief executive officer, ultimately decided against the acquisition of the Goodyear unit because its cost would interfere with a planned stock buyback. The aerospace unit has since been sold to another buyer.    Shearson was aware of GenCorp's &quot;unwillingness to make financial commitments of a magnitude&quot; that would hinder the share repurchase and &quot;of the fact that by making such commitments, GenCorp could reduce its liquidity, thereby making itself less attractive as a potential acquisition,&quot; the filing said.    Among other things, GenCorp's amended complaint seeks injunctions prohibiting Shearson from taking part in the General Partners tender offer. It also asks that the defendants be barred from acquiring more GenCorp stock and that they surrender profits on purchases made in alleged violation of securities laws.    GenCorp originally sued Wagner andamp; Brown and AFG Industries March 23. That suit, which also seeks to block the tender offer, followed an earlier suit in which the partnership sought to void GenCorp's antitakeover provisions.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, GenCorp closed at $117.25, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
