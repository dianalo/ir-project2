There was no immediate response from the Salvadoran government,but it did announce a 48-hour cease-fire.   The announcements followed a fierce pre-dawn battle innortheastern El Salvador in which at least 16 soldiers were killed.   Armed Forces spokesmen reported the deaths after the fightingoutside Chilanga in Morazan province. They said the rebels alsosuffered ``numerous casualties'' but gave no number.   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which representsfive left-wing guerrilla groups fighting El Salvador's U.S.-backedgovernment, called for talks to be held in Mexico starting sometimebetween next Sunday and Thursday _ Sept. 10-Sept. 14.   Col. Inocente Montano, the vice minister of defense, said Tuesdaythe armed forces would observe a cease-fire Sept. 14-15 as part ofthe celebration marking Central America's independence from Spain onSept. 15, 1821.   Montano did not mention the rebels' proposal for peace talks buttold reporters the cease-fire ``is a positive initiative ... as longas it is respected by the FMLN,'' the Spanish initials for theguerrillas's front.   A cease-fire for the independence festivities had been suggestedon Monday by the Permanent Committee of the National Debate forPeace, an organization representing more than 70 church, union,humanitarian and civic groups.   It the government agrees to the proposed peace negotiations itwould be the first meeting between the two sides since PresidentAlfredo Cristiani of the conservative Republican NationalistAlliance suggested talks at his inauguration June 1. The guerrillasagreed at that time but the effort snagged on the mechanics ofarranging the dialogue.   ``We're taking away practically all obstacles,'' said AnaGuadalupe Martinez, a rebel commander. ``We're making it the easiestthing in the world.''   In a significant softening of their previous conditions, she saidthe front would bargain with any committee the government names.   Before, the rebels had insisted that an army representative andhigh-level officials be at the negotiating table. They rejected onedelegation the government considered on grounds its members wouldnot have the power to negotiate.   The front suggested the dates and Mexico as a site for the talksin a proposal sent Friday to Cristiani through Monsignor ArturoRivera Damas, the archbishop of San Salvador, Ms. Martinez told anews conference in Mexico City.   She added the front has not received a reply from the government.   But she said the FMLN had received an unacceptable response to aproposal that the government release all wounded rebel it is holdingas prisoners.   Ms. Martinez said the proposal was made through Rivera Damas andthe government replied that it would release the wounded prisonersif the rebels stopped sabotaging electrical installations and theirbans on transportation.   ``That point was not negotiable,'' she said.   Mario Lopez, another rebel commander, said new steps would beannounced Thursday.   ``Commanders will make public a series of measures to create anatmosphere of confidence for the negotiations,'' Lopez toldreporters.   He did not elaborate but there was speculation the offers mightinclude a cease-fire.   In the past the guerrillas have opposed a unilateral cease-fire,saying a truce would have be to be negotiated at the bargainingtable.   The FMLN, in its proposal for talks next week, again demandedRivera Damas be present during negotiations.   Cristiani has said the archbishop should not be involved in thetalks.   The FMLN also has insisted that delegates from the Organizationof American States and United Nations be present.   Lopez said rebel representatives met Monday in Costa Rica withOAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares and Francisco Bandrel, aU.N. representative.   Three rounds of talks with the government of former PresidentJose Napoleon Duarte between 1984 and 1987 failed to make progresstoward ending the nearly 10-year-old war. Duarte headed a centristChristian Democrat government.   An estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have beenkilled in the fighting.</TEXT></DOC>
