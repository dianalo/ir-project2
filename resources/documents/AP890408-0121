(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   City officials asked a court to declarethe Mobil Oil Corp. refinery here a public nuisance following aseries of mishaps that have killed three people and injured dozenssince 1987.   The lawsuit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, allegesthe ``potential for massive disaster'' at the 750-acre refinery,with the city especially fearing the uncontrolled release of toxichydrofluoric acid.   The complaint asks the court to bar Mobil from polluting the airwith the acid and other toxic chemicals and order the company tosafely operate the refinery in southern Los Angeles County. Thefacility produces about 12 percent of Southern California'sgasoline.   Officials in this city of 140,000 people did not say in detailwhat actions they might take if the court issued such an order.   Mobil officials had not seen the lawsuit late Friday anddeclined to comment on the specific allegations.   Scientists say a 1,000-gallon hydrofluoric acid spill couldproduce a lethal toxic cloud capable of spreading over a five-milerange.   The lawsuit was the city's latest attempt to respond to a seriesof fires, explosions and other problems that have claimed threelives at the refinery since 1987.   A consultant's report in January blamed carelessness and laxmanagement for what it called an ``unacceptable'' number ofproblems at the facility since 1987.   In November, the federal government cited Mobil and nine of itscontractors for 100 safety violations and recommended finestotaling $30,040. Mobil officials are contesting the federalfindings.</TEXT></DOC>
