The probe detectsa two allele Pvu II polymorphism with bands at 5.0 and 5.6 kb and aninvariant band at 3.5 kb. The probe also detects polymorphisms with HincII, Nsi I, Stu I, Xba I and Xmn I, which appear to be in complete linkagedisequilibrium. The probe has been localized to 4p16.3 by somatic cellbybrids. Co-dominant inheritance has been shown in CEPH families 2, 17,45, 884, 1331, 1333, 1344, 1345, 1350, 1375, 1377, 1408, 1416, 1418,1420, 1421, 13,291 and 13,292.</TEXT></DOC>
