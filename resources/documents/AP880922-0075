The Lebanese Shiite Moslem defendant already is on trial formurder, air piracy and other charges stemming from the June 1985ordeal in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.   Court spokesman Falk Thomas said that after recent dramatictestimony from American passengers and crew members, Frankfurtprosecutors have asked the court to include a charge of attemptedmurder of American passenger Kurt Carlson.   Witnesses have testified that Hamadi and his accused fellowhijacker, Hassan Ezzeddine, mercilessly beat the Rockford, Ill.,man during the hijacking that kept 39 Americans captive for 17 days.   ``The prosecutor's office has asked the court to formally notifyHamadi that his actions can be judged as attempted murder,'' Thomastold The Associated Press in an interview.   ``The court will still have to decide whether such a charge isincluded,'' Thomas added. He said ``there is no time pressure'' forthe court to make such a decision.   Thomas said that the maximum sentence for attempted murder is alife prison term.   In the latest testimony regarding Carlson, chief flightattendant Uli Derickson on Wednesday described how Carlson wasattacked by both hijackers, and said that he lay quietly near thecockpit.   ``I was convinced he was dead, because I had to step over himseveral times,'' the 44-year-old Mrs. Derickson said. ``But then Itouched him and he moved.''   The flight attendant said she then told Hamadi of Carlson'sfamily, and Hamadi apologized to the beaten Army Reserve officersaying ``I didn't mean to kill you.''   Carlson survived the ordeal and has also testified at Hamadi'strial about his beatings.   On Wednesday, Mrs. Derickson broke down in sobs as she talkedabout the lasting psychological impact of the hijacking.   ``I can imagine everyone on that flight is suffering,'' she toldthe court. ``I suffered deep psychological effects, and I am stillunder therapy.''   Hamadi, who prosecutors say is 24 years old, has admitted takingpart in the hijacking but has denied killing U.S. Navy diver RobertStethem of Waldorf, Md.   But John Testrake, the pilot, testified last week that hebelieved Hamadi was the hijacker who shot and killed Stethem.   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987, aftercustoms officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.   In the week following his arrest, two West Germans werekidnapped in Beirut in a failed scheme to win his release.Kidnappers have since released both West German hostages.   In addition to murder and air piracy, Hamadi has also beencharged with hostage-taking, causing bodily harm and robbery. Healso is on trial on charges of smuggling explosives and use offalsified documents stemming from his arrest at Frankfurt airport.   The TWA jet was hijacked to Beirut on a flight from Athens inJune 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
