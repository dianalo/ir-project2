When fundamentalist PatRobertson ran against George Bush for the GOP nomination, youbewailed the &quot;forgotten&quot; constituency gathered under Mr.Robertson's banner of, yes, the same &quot;tub-thumping populism&quot;David Duke embraces.   I venture to say that the reason the proverbial &quot;wolf&quot; isat the door in the person of David Duke is as much becausemany in the GOP have long thundered about bringing thedisaffected, often bigoted working-class voters under theparty's &quot;big tent.&quot; Ye shall reap what ye sow.</LP><TEXT>   Brian T. Petty   Washington   ---   Are you practicing revisionist journalism? You say GeorgeBush's presidential campaign &quot;had nothing to do with&quot; theWillie Horton commercial. Roger Ailes was chief mediastrategist for Mr. Bush in 1988, and he told Time he producedthe ad. In discussing preparations, he said, &quot;The onlyquestion is whether we depict Willie Horton with a knife inhis hand or without it&quot; (Time, Aug. 22, 1988).   Gregory Mazurkiewicz   Orchard Lake, Mich.   ---   I agree with you. It's shameful and worrisome that a&quot;former&quot; Nazi and &quot;ex&quot; Ku Klux Klan grand dragon is acontender for a governorship. It speaks poorly of ourdedication to the principle that we're all created equal whena racist becomes a viable candidate. And I'm not asking &quot;Whatis this country coming to?&quot; Rather, it is going -- nowhere.   Christian S. Anderson   College Park, Md.</TEXT></DOC>
