The name of the Broken Bow VOR has been changedto Custer County VOR. Accordingly, alteration of the Broken Bow transitionarea description is necessary to reflect this name change. Section 71.181of part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in Handbook7400.6E, dated January 3, 1989.Since this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public wouldnot be particularly interested, notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C.553(b) are unnecessary.The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71</ITAG>Aviation safety, Transition areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, part 71 of theFAR (14 CFR Part 71) is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS</ITAG>1.
