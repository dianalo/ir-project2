(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most automotive speed machines come incolors other than passionate pink, but no one laughs when JohnMitchell arrives in his magenta Plymouth Valiant Duster.   The 1970 Chrysler product, with a rare model of engine, may beworth several times its price paid back in those days when a carcould be had for under $3,000.   ``The paint name is magenta, nicknamed panther pink,'' saidBruce Friar of Anderson, who helped Mitchell restore the originalsheen.   ``We had to call (the manufacturer) and get the formula. Theyonly painted 12 originally, and being the kind of car it is, it'sextremely rare.''   The number of these classic pink muscle cars yet remaining couldprobably be counted on one hand. Mitchell says his, which has just40,000 miles on it, may be the only one that's been completelyrestored.   ``A friend of mine (who) deals in high-performance cars saidthat it's worth at least $15,000 to $20,000, and said if it's theonly one, you could probably name your price,'' Mitchell said.   Not that it's for sale, said Mitchell, who has worked forChrysler Corp. in New Castle for 23 years.   ``I'm probably going to hang onto it,'' he said. ``I'd hate toget rid of something and not know what it's worth.''</TEXT></DOC>
