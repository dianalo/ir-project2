Spread spectrum systems are communications systems in which informationis conveyed by modulation of a carrier by some conventional means, butthe bandwidth is deliberately broadened by means of a spreading functionover a much wider bandwidth than that which would be needed to convey theinformation alone. On May 9, 1985, in the First Report and Order in GeneralDocket No. 81-413 (50 FR 25234, June 18, 1985), the Commission adoptedprovisions for the use of spread spectrum emissions under andSection;15.126of the rules. The rules allowed direct sequence and frequency hopping spreadspectrum systems to operate in the 902-928 MHz, 2400-2483.5 MHz and 5725-5850MHz frequency bands. Since that time, the Commission has received manyrequests for clarification of the minimum length of the spreading code.2. In our analysis to determine an appropriate minimum length for the spreadingcode of direct sequence systems, the rules governing spread spectrum operationin the Amateur Radio Service were reviewed. The Amateur Radio rules requirethat a minimum spreading code length of 127 bits be used. This minimumlength also appears a reasonable choice as the minimum length standardfor part 15 direct sequence systems. Pseudorandomly generated codes ofthis length will provide an adequate and uniform spreading of the transmittedenergy. As such codes are fairly easy to generate, the proposed rules wouldnot be expected to impose a new technological burden upon industry. Therefore,we are proposing a minimum pseudorandomly generated code length of 127bits. 3. To further encourage the development of this technology, the proposedrules would allow frequency hopping sytems to operate in the 902-928 MHz,2400-2483.5 MHz and 5725-5850 MHz bands with hopping channel bandwidthsof 500 kHz. As the maximum output power for these systems will still bemaintained at 1 Watt, the larger hopping channel bandwidth would in mostcases reduce any potential interference from these systems since the transmittedpower is being spread over a larger bandwidth. However, to accommodatenonoverlapping hopping channels of 500 kHz bandwidth in the 902-928 MHzband, the minimum number of hopping frequencies prescribed for a frequencyhopping system operating in this band would be reduced from 75 to 50. Tofurther reduce potential interference to other communications systems operatingwithin these bands, the new rules propose that the channel occupancy timefor frequency hopping systems be averaged over a 5 second interval in the902-928 MHz band and a 7.5 second interval in the 2400-2483.5 MHz and 5725-5850MHz bands rather than the present 30 second interval. 4. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rule making proceeding.See andSection;1.1231 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 1.1231 for rulesgoverning permissible ex parte contacts. 5. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 603, theproposed rules will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it provides guidanceand minimum standards consistent with the industry's needs. Public commentis requested on the initial regulatory flexibility analysis set out infull in the Commission's complete decision. 6. The proposal contained herein has been analyzed with respect to thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and found to impose no additional informationcollection requirement on the public. 7. Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in andSection;andSection;1.415and 1.419, interested parties may file comments on or before October 2,1989, and reply comments on or before October 17, 1989. All relevant andtimely comments will be considered by the Commission before final actionis taken in this proceeding. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>47 CFR Part 2Terminology, Radio.47 CFR Part 15Intentional radiators, Radio.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rule Changes</ITAG>A.

It resembles a true randomsequence in that the one bits and zero bits of the sequence are distributedrandomly throughout every length, N, of the sequence and the total numbersof the one and zero bits in that length are approximately equal. It cannotbe called a true random sequence however because it consists of a fixednumber (or length) of coded bits which repeats itself exactly wheneverthat length is exceeded, and because it is generated by a fixed algorithmfrom some fixed initial state.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>B.
