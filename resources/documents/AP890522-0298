Those suspicions are rekindled today by a new kind of Crusader,Christian evangelists such as Americans Jerry Falwell and PatRobertson.   They preach that Israel fulfills Biblical prophecies predictingthe arrival of a new Messiah and seek to convert Moslems.   ``The Crusaders came out of the conviction that we were notChristian enough,'' said Gabriel Habib, General Secretary of theCyprus-based Middle East Council of Churches.   Crusader castles dot the modern states of Syria, Lebanon, Israeland Jordan, symbols that Christianity, although born in the HolyLand, was later a colonizer.   Now the Christian fundamentalists are ``projecting an image ofChristianity of political and economic power. It's the image of anew crusade, this time allied with Israel,'' Habib said.   The fundamentalist groups have opened the so-calledInternational Christian Embassy in Jerusalem, where Israel has itscapital, to spread their teachings.   A glossy tract published by a California church says: ``Jesus iscoming to rule _ from Jerusalem.''   Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network has a televisionstation in an Israeli-held sector of south Lebanon. It has beendestroyed twice in bombing attacks.   The station's administrative manager, who agreed to beinterviewed only on condition of anonymity, said Robertson'ssupport for Israel is a personal statement and the station tries toavoid politics.   Almost 70 percent of its programming ranges from U.S. footballto ``Magnum P.I.,'' he said.   But he noted that the rest are ``programs to inspire people intheir faith.'' Pro-Iranian Moslem militants in Lebanon would liketo see these off the air, he said.   Evangelical groups say they work in the Middle East because theregion's Christians, isolated in minority pockets around the Arabworld, are not forceful enough.   Seeking converts ``is what the Gospel calls them to do amongtheir own people,'' said a missionary with the Assembly of God whodid not want his name used because it might limit his ability totravel in the region.   ``I wish every Coptic priest, every Roman Catholic priest woulddo it,'' he added.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 28</NOTE></DOC>
