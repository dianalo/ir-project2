The Senate has traditionally leaned strongly toward suchreductions, but some senators who have favored capital gains cutsin the past find the new proposal unacceptable because of thecurrent budget deficit and its tilt to the wealthy.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee andlongtime backer of lower taxes on capital gains, said he willrecommend that a capital gains cut not be included when thecommittee begins work Monday on a deficit-reduction plan.   Bentsen, D-Texas, said Friday that an incentive for saving andinvestment is needed, but a temporary cut followed by an increasedrate ``would destabilize the markets. It's sheer budget gimmickry.''   Instead, Bentsen is proposing that tax-deductible IndividualRetirement Accounts be made available to more workers to encouragesaving.   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., a member of the committee, said thepanel is likely to reject the capital gains reduction and acceptthe IRA alternative.   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, said ``Ithink there is a reasonably good chance we'll be able to prevail''in the Senate and defeat the capital gains cut.   If that happened, tax-writers from the House and Senate wouldhave to negotiate some kind of compromise that could include both acapital gains reduction and liberalized IRAs.   In a hard-fought vote Thursday, the House accepted a plansupported by Bush that would reduce capital gains tax rates for 27months. The maximum rate, now 33 percent, would be cut to 20percent. On Jan. 1, 1992, the top rate would be raised to 28percent and investments ``indexed'' so that profits caused byinflation would not be taxed.   There is general agreement that cutting the rates wouldencourage investors to sell assets before the rates rose again,generating about $9.4 billion in new revenue over three years.Bentsen insists ``this yo-yo effect'' would do nothing to encouragelong-term investment.   But the strongest political point about the capital gains cut isthat by any reckoning, most of the tax saving would go to thosewith the greatest wealth.   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said the reduction wouldsimply be ``mailing a check for $25,000 to every Republicancontributor in the last campaign.''   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that people withincomes above $200,000 who report capital gains would get tax cutsaveraging $24,906 apiece.   ``It is hard for me to understand why this whole discussion hasto reach the level of rich versus poor,'' Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady told a Senate Finance Committee hearing Friday.   ``The rich are getting richer in this country and the poor aregetting poorer,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``You'll have toforgive us for bringing it up.''   The joint-committee staff, which provides tax expertise to theHouse and Senate, estimates 80 percent of the tax saving from thecapital gains cut would go to couples and individuals with incomesabove $100,000 a year.   Brady contends that figure is misleading because theover-$100,000 category includes many people of relatively modestearnings who, once in a lifetime, sell a small business or a homeand show greater incomes in that one year.   The secretary estimated that 47 percent of capital gains arerealized by people whose other income _ not including the gains _is less than $50,000 a year.   But Bentsen said the joint-committee staff found that only 18percent of the gains were taken by people who reported just onecapital gains transaction _ including sale of a home or business _a year.   Brady also said more than 80 percent of the tax saving from theIRA expansion proposed by Bentsen would go to workers with incomesabove $50,000 a year.</TEXT></DOC>
