The subsidy plan known as a ``triggered marketing loan'' wasincluded in the Senate version of the 1,000-page trade bill. Houseand Senate negotiators are working on a compromise.   Final action on the loan program was postponed when HouseAgriculture Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, said Tuesdaythat Senate Agriculture Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., had thevotes but wanted a few revisions.   Under marketing loan programs, some of which already are ineffect, producers receive the U.S. price for their crops, which arethen sold at world market prices. The taxpayers make up thedifference.   The plan under consideration would create such provisions forwheat, corn and soybeans but only if current negotiations failed toproduce an agreement among the nation's trading partners to reduceagricultural subsidies by the 1990 wheat marketing year.   Leahy said he was convinced of the need for a triggeredmarketing loan on a trip to Geneva last week to get a progressreport on negotiations aimed at reaching a new General Agreement onTariffs and Trade.   He said European negotiators have been ``arrogant'' in theirrejection of U.S. demands for an end to export subsidies. He saidAmericans at the table in Geneva favor the triggered marketing loanas a ``club'' to hold over the Europeans and prod them on the issue.   ``If you were talking to some of the people we have to negotiatewith, then you might think we need it, too,'' Leahy said.   In other action, the panel approved expanding the 1985 ExportEnhancement Program by more than $1 billion to $2.5 billion. Itprovides bonuses in the form of government-held commodities toexporters to ship American commodities that they acquired at U.S.prices.   Critics of the triggered marketing loan program said that thesum involved could strain the budget.   ``This is potentially a huge sum of money we're talking about inagricultural programs,'' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., whosehome-state growers are often wary of anything that could promptrestrictions abroad against orange and grapefruit exports.   Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, said the use of such a measureas a bargaining chip would not be credible now because it wouldrequire reshuffling budget priorities.   Stenholm did say he favored the objective. He said the UnitedStates should tell the European Community: ``If they have unlimitedsupplies of money, it's going to cost all of it and we're going toraise you five.''   Gibbons presented a letter from Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter and otheradministration officials suggesting that attaching the programcould prompt a presidential veto for the trade bill.</TEXT></DOC>
