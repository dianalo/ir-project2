The U.S. case regarding the Italian Olivetti company, whichofficials say is based on intelligence information, was brought upWednesday at a White House meeting between President Bush andItalian President Francesco Cossiga.   ``The President did mention the concern about the Olivetti case.And President Cossiga stressed that this was being pursued in ... ahighly cooperative manner,'' said Assistant Secretary of StateRaymond Seitz, briefing reporters about Cossiga's talks with Bush.   The United States notified Italy earlier this month thatOlivetti, one of Europe's largest computer companies, was suspectedof violating rules set by the 17-nation Coordinating Committee ofMultilateral Export Controls (COCOM), said Italian Foreign MinisterGianni De Michelis.   He said Italy was investigating the information and would informthe United States of the results at a meeting Oct. 22 in Rome withReginald Bartholomew, assistant secretary of state for science andtechnology.   In Rome, Premier Giulio Andreotti met for about an hourWednesday with Olivetti's Carlo De Benedetti. Neither made anystatements at the end of the meeting, although Olivetti has issueda statement denying any violation of COCOM rules and contending theproducts in question were shipped to the Soviet Union with COCOMauthorization.   U.S. and Italian officials have refused to publicly discussdetails of the case, which involves one of the most powerfulcompanies in Europe and sensitive intelligence information aboutSoviet weaponry.   But an American official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Olivetti was suspected of selling the Soviets machine toolsand computer software which were used to manufacture components forthe YAK-41 supersonic jetfighter. The highly sophisticated plane iscapable of taking off vertically.   Another official said the sales had been going on for severalyears, and involved ``less than $50 million.''   Members of COCOM, which regulates the sale of high-technology tocommunist countries, have differed in recent years regarding salesof so-called ``dual use'' technology, which can be converted tomanufacture weapons.   The most famous case of such a COCOM rule violation involved thesale of computerized milling equipment by the Japanese Toshibaelectronics firm and the Norwegian state-owned Kongsbergconglomerate to the Soviets. The equipment was used by the Sovietsto make silent propellers for submarines, making them harder forthe West to detect.   As a result, Congress passed legislation last year empoweringthe administration to impose sanctions, including import bans,against companies found in violation of COCOM.   De Michelis sought to play down the Olivetti case, saying he hadonly discussed the matter for ``25 seconds'' with BartholomewWednesday.   De Michelis stressed that the main thrust of the Cossiga talkswith Bush was prospects for peace in the Middle East, the upcomingelections in Nicaragua and, above all, the reforms in EasternEurope.   Seitz told reporters Bush and Cossiga ``waxed philosophicalabout East-West issues and the importance of defense throughoutthis period of change in Europe.''   Bush ``stressed how in these times of transition and uncertaintyand, in some instances, unrest, that the hope not precede the deedand that the importance of a strong defense, a continuing defense,a steady approach, a long-term approach cannot be understated.''   Later at a state dinner Bush hosted in Cossiga's honor at theWhite House, the American president lauded the friendship betweenItaly and the United States, saying the ties have ``never beenstronger.''</TEXT></DOC>
