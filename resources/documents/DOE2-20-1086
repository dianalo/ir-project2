<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-20-1086 </DOCNO><TEXT>This paper describes the dynamic behavior of wind turbine generators connectedto isolated grids. Both synchronous and induction generators are considered.In order to obtain maximum power, constant frequency and voltage, threecontrol systems are examined: blade pitch angle control, field excitationvoltage control (only for synchronous machine) and firing angle controlof thyristor controlled reactor (for induction generator). Some simulationresults are also presented. 8 references, 10 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
