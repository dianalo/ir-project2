<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0417 </DOCNO><TEXT>A leak detector for detecting a fine leakage of steam at the initial operationin high temperature, high pressure steam piping facilities has been developed.As it was impossible to render the detector light in weight and compact,a sensor has been newly developed, which contributes to the simplificationof the detecting element, the circuit, and the display. The detectoris about one-half in size and about one-third in weight of the conventionaldetector. The use of the trial detector in the power plant has shownvalidity as a practical steam leak detector. The humidity sensor is aceramics which is prepared from a barium titanate major component andthe additives of magnesium zirconate and potassium zirconate. For thestructure, the ceramics is sandwiched between two metal electrodes, andis surrounded and covered with a ceramics. For the action principle,the detector detects a change in electric impedance of the metal electrodesin contact with the atomosphere which is caused when steam gets intocontact with the electrodes.
