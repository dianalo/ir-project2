The analysis is based on representationof the kernel of the Schroedinger equation for the electron and positronin the potential of the target material in the form of a Feynman pathintegral. It is shown that the probability of passage of positroniumfor a target thickness L less than some critical value L/sub cr/ shouldbe described by the eikonal approximation, which gives for it a dependenceL{sup -1}, and for L{similar_to}L/sub cr/ there is a rapid replacementof the dependence L{sup -1} by a dependence L{sup -4}.</TEXT></DOC>
